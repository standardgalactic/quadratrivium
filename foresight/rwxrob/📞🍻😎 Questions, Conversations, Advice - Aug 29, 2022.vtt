WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Okay, start. There we go. So we're now recording it. We're in dark mode today

00:04.080 --> 00:10.920
Mostly because it's a total disaster in my room right now. But as you can see, there is a server taking form

00:11.360 --> 00:13.360
It's coming alive

00:14.000 --> 00:19.040
my server and I've actually got another playlist on YouTube called home lab in it

00:20.160 --> 00:21.440
and

00:21.440 --> 00:23.280
It will be

00:23.280 --> 00:26.300
About how to set up your own home lab or how I set up my home lab

00:27.080 --> 00:28.280
and

00:28.280 --> 00:34.000
I don't know how or when I'll be recording that but we're gonna come to them

00:34.000 --> 00:37.040
So the first question that is everybody still talking about so I'm gonna talk about it is

00:38.160 --> 00:40.700
Did you buy all Raspberry Pi's in the world for your rig?

00:42.280 --> 00:49.000
And you can't see it but like right up here on the top there's a 16 by cost me 250 dollars by the way

00:49.440 --> 00:52.600
Yeah, 250 dollars to get an aluminum Raspberry Pi

00:53.880 --> 00:55.880
Hot swappable

00:55.880 --> 00:57.120
to you

00:57.120 --> 00:58.440
rack

00:58.440 --> 01:00.440
shelf and

01:00.560 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, and I'm gonna be putting that there

01:05.040 --> 01:09.760
For that if I know I didn't I actually have 30 or so Raspberry Pi's. I mean I keep finding them everywhere

01:09.760 --> 01:17.040
I need to remind everybody I used to run a company. I founded a company called skill stack in 2013 where I was you know

01:17.040 --> 01:22.440
Mentoring people in person at a school. I lived in a town home above it and the bottom floor was

01:22.880 --> 01:27.600
Just lab in school. You can go to twitter.com slash skill stack SK

01:27.600 --> 01:28.880
I'll

01:28.880 --> 01:34.280
SDAK if you want to see pictures of it from from back in the day and maybe I need to show you that really quick

01:34.800 --> 01:36.800
Because I want to

01:38.240 --> 01:44.520
All right, so to our studio audience who can't you're an audio only I'm going to twitter.com and

01:45.160 --> 01:47.160
I am pulling up some

01:47.520 --> 01:49.640
nostalgic photos from skill stack my

01:50.640 --> 01:52.640
Once popular

01:54.120 --> 02:00.960
Place and this is where I have my curriculum and there's like pictures and all sorts of things and if you go to actually if you

02:00.960 --> 02:02.360
Go to Instagram

02:02.360 --> 02:06.080
You'll see some stuff. The question is about Raspberry Pi and that's what I wanted to show you

02:06.440 --> 02:08.720
So actually Instagram is a little bit more fun

02:09.520 --> 02:11.520
if you go to instagram

02:11.920 --> 02:13.920
comm slash skill stack you'll see

02:15.320 --> 02:17.720
Videos and stuff that I've done and including

02:18.520 --> 02:22.560
So this is the there's my red rack behind me right behind my head

02:23.360 --> 02:29.920
That used to be my really really really really cheap. I mean look at how ugly it is, but you got to understand

02:29.920 --> 02:32.640
I ran my own company. I kept my costs really low

02:33.440 --> 02:37.360
And so I didn't have a proper rack. I do now because I work for a

02:38.240 --> 02:45.560
Big-ass company and I make a really cushy salary. So I've been dropping, you know, like $300 on to you Raspberry Pi

02:46.560 --> 02:51.280
Thanks, but this this is like the thing so all these little green lights out the bottom by the way

02:51.280 --> 02:53.280
Or I have 19 Mac minis that are installed

02:53.920 --> 02:55.920
Which make really really great?

02:56.480 --> 02:59.880
Cloud home lab kind of things. This is me organizing

03:00.240 --> 03:05.240
That was when I had to move skill stack into my apartment to my house that I rented for two years

03:05.240 --> 03:10.760
And then we moved here and so now as you know the ongoing saga. We're going to be moving within a year

03:11.760 --> 03:13.960
To some other location. We don't even know where

03:14.960 --> 03:19.280
To do my wife's MFA and we'll take a Raspberry Pi's with this

03:19.280 --> 03:24.840
But no, we did not buy all the Raspberry Pi's, but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from. Oh, this is a great

03:24.840 --> 03:29.560
This was a game camp. This was this guy this guy made his own like

03:30.640 --> 03:32.640
amazing thing

03:34.080 --> 03:41.300
We don't know where we're going so this is the game camp this was a summer camp that we had and that was my workstation at the time

03:42.300 --> 03:45.060
But I'm just showing you this we had like lightsaber camp

03:45.380 --> 03:49.940
It kind of stuck hot damn these kids are so young all these kids are in college now

03:51.340 --> 03:54.860
They're all in college now. Oh, I just found the box with lightsabers

03:55.540 --> 03:57.580
Yeah, I found the box of lightsabers

03:59.060 --> 04:04.660
This guy like distro hopped like ten times in like a week amazing student

04:05.660 --> 04:07.340
anyway, so

04:07.340 --> 04:09.660
We don't know. I don't think it's gonna be Wyoming. No, I don't know where

04:10.340 --> 04:14.740
So but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from so everybody's wondering where they came from

04:14.740 --> 04:16.740
I know I'm not buying them up

04:16.740 --> 04:20.700
They're leftovers. In fact, so where them people like why do you have all this apple?

04:20.700 --> 04:22.700
I mean, there you go. This is what I wanted to show you

04:22.900 --> 04:24.900
This is Raspberry Pi camp

04:25.100 --> 04:27.100
Check that out. Check that crap out

04:27.620 --> 04:32.300
He wrote that from scratch. He did it on himself the entire requirements

04:32.300 --> 04:33.020
Look at this one, man

04:33.020 --> 04:38.620
The requirements for this Raspberry Pi in case you can't see it the requirements for this Raspberry Pi class was just to like

04:38.860 --> 04:41.660
make one of the things was blank and

04:42.180 --> 04:47.820
He just he just kind of kept experimenting and putting wires everywhere and trying everything out

04:47.820 --> 04:51.740
And he didn't make in his own full-blown like microcontroller extension

04:52.380 --> 04:56.660
And I was like, oh my gosh, this is what happens by the way when you give

04:57.380 --> 04:58.300
people

04:58.300 --> 05:00.300
Freedom to be creative in their learning

05:01.700 --> 05:05.320
Yeah, and so that's where the Raspberry Pi's came from so I have about 30

05:06.200 --> 05:09.800
I have a sort of robot. This is the old this is the old apartment where I used to live

05:11.120 --> 05:13.120
Before I got kicked out of that

05:13.760 --> 05:18.960
You give them the freedom and they'll that okay. Here's another here's Sean. This is this was a this was us getting hacked

05:19.760 --> 05:22.040
We we put a cloud server up

05:22.160 --> 05:23.520
We put up a cloud server

05:23.520 --> 05:27.000
This is security camp and we put a cloud server up and this is

05:27.720 --> 05:34.480
The cloud server got hacked within a day during the camp during the week on camp. We said how long will it take somebody to hack us?

05:35.080 --> 05:39.280
right and we were learning like all of these different commands and

05:40.200 --> 05:45.480
his cloud server got hacked his his honeypot got hacked within a day and

05:46.280 --> 05:49.880
And we were sitting there watching all the stuff it was doing and we were doing s trace

05:49.880 --> 05:54.160
This is s trace. This is s trace on the the process that had hacked us

05:54.160 --> 05:59.860
And so we could like see what the with the malware was doing and track it down and stuff. It's really really fun

06:01.240 --> 06:03.160
Anyway, good times

06:03.160 --> 06:06.720
No, he got we wanted to get hacked the people who got hacked first

06:06.720 --> 06:11.020
They was like fishing like we were fishing. So if you got hacked first, you're one of the lucky ones

06:11.020 --> 06:15.000
That means you got a bite. So he got a bot. He got a bite on the first day

06:16.200 --> 06:20.080
And somebody hacked his closet. The whole point was to show how quickly

06:20.800 --> 06:23.680
Unprotected did you see that royal typewriter right there by the way?

06:24.600 --> 06:28.880
Yeah, that real typewriter is was part of I just spilled my coffee on myself

06:29.480 --> 06:33.080
That's why I have a towel right here to protect myself from this kind of like mishap

06:33.480 --> 06:37.000
Because I'm an idiot and it's also really dark. My coffee cup is brown

06:39.120 --> 06:44.320
Hmm, I think I might have to add more vodka to it. I'm sure that was not a contributing factor

06:47.640 --> 06:51.760
Are we still having fun master shells Matt you want in okay, here you come

06:52.800 --> 06:55.520
You're gonna give me crap. I know but I'm used to it

06:58.880 --> 07:00.880
All right, wait, wait, wait, give me a second

07:05.480 --> 07:11.640
Hey Rob, hi, how are you doing? Audio is a little bit messed up. Let me fix the audio here my audio

07:17.320 --> 07:19.320
Problem with my device

07:21.320 --> 07:26.280
Anyway, so yeah, we did a lot of stuff there, but that's where the Raspberry Pi came from and I promise you

07:27.280 --> 07:33.640
Uh, this whole open source contributed some coffee to the salt. No, thank God my map my laptop's closed

07:33.840 --> 07:39.640
Yeah, so it wasn't it was only half full the guy or half empty whichever way you want to look at it

07:41.040 --> 07:44.120
Hmm, and there's my old IP numbers. Anyway

07:48.680 --> 07:51.760
Do I need to add that to the list so I have to answer that right now I

07:52.760 --> 07:57.160
Mean I'm gonna add it to the list. Let's do that. I'll add that one right now answer that for you right now. Yes

07:58.680 --> 08:00.680
Yes, I do

08:01.240 --> 08:03.240
Anybody seen triumph of the nerds

08:04.480 --> 08:09.360
If you haven't seen triumph of the nerds, then you don't understand what a compliment it is to call me a nerd

08:10.120 --> 08:12.120
So go watch it

08:12.200 --> 08:13.880
seriously

08:13.880 --> 08:18.040
Seriously, if you have not watched triumph of the nerds, you need to

08:19.040 --> 08:21.760
All right triumph of the nerds

08:23.480 --> 08:26.160
Videos, I think it's out there for free. There it is

08:27.040 --> 08:29.840
Excuse me 1996 documentary triumph of the nerds

08:29.840 --> 08:34.200
it's like a three-part documentary that goes through the creation of

08:34.840 --> 08:36.440
nerddom and

08:36.440 --> 08:40.840
if you really want to understand the origin of personal computing and the internet there was a

08:41.480 --> 08:46.040
Triumph of the nerds to the car. No, it was like two point two point one

08:46.040 --> 08:49.120
I think and that was how the internet got made and

08:50.480 --> 08:56.360
I think it's Bob cringely is the guy who did it the same guy who famously did the interview with Steve Jobs

08:56.360 --> 08:59.960
Which they found old footage of which resurfaced near the end there

09:00.080 --> 09:04.400
There's two point. Oh, if you want to get a real solid handle on

09:05.600 --> 09:12.680
Technology history the most significant me can read the innovators, which is like a 300 400 page book or you can go

09:13.000 --> 09:18.400
Watch triumph of the nerd. So if you haven't seen it cue it up. It's amazing. It's really fun

09:19.280 --> 09:21.400
It's it's it's from a different time

09:22.560 --> 09:27.200
Interestingly enough the guy who did this the guy who did this actually lived in Steve Jobs neighborhood

09:27.200 --> 09:29.680
He worked for Apple computer when it was in a garage

09:30.720 --> 09:33.720
And then and then it became so much more. So

09:34.720 --> 09:37.280
I'll just tell you about that. So absolutely. I'm a nerd

09:37.880 --> 09:45.280
But the real question is are you a nerd or a geek and if you haven't seen that nerd or a geek back when you could actually watch

09:47.400 --> 09:53.880
When you could watch Rhett and link Rhett and link have completely sold out. They're just grifters now I

09:54.680 --> 09:57.320
Used to really love Rhett and link. This was eight years ago

09:57.560 --> 10:05.080
But if you haven't seen the epic rap battle of nerd versus geek which I cannot show here because we're doing you know a thing on YouTube

10:05.840 --> 10:07.840
Make sure you watch it

10:08.160 --> 10:12.040
If you don't know the difference between a need and a Gurt egg, did I say a neek a

10:12.920 --> 10:18.040
Geek is like we I'm not gonna tell you what they are. You need to watch Rhett and link have this nice fight

10:18.040 --> 10:20.880
It's really it's a really great rap battle. I think you'll really enjoy it

10:22.520 --> 10:24.520
So they are definitely different

10:26.880 --> 10:28.200
But

10:28.200 --> 10:32.400
Like play it like ten times and slow it down and like listen to what they say

10:32.800 --> 10:36.720
Because it it pretty much perfectly captures the difference between a geek and an earth

10:38.680 --> 10:41.280
So that's that what this is a question

10:42.440 --> 10:45.520
What's your favorite tech art anything related to goes logo? I

10:46.560 --> 10:48.560
Really really really do like goes logo

10:50.000 --> 10:52.160
those of you who know René René French

10:53.280 --> 10:54.560
and

10:54.560 --> 10:57.320
is is Rob Pike's wife and

10:58.040 --> 11:02.160
The gopher is was designed by René French

11:03.080 --> 11:05.360
Who has done many other things as well?

11:07.640 --> 11:08.840
And

11:08.840 --> 11:10.840
You could go you can go look at them

11:11.400 --> 11:13.400
And and see about them

11:14.040 --> 11:18.360
We can look at some of the different images here. So here is all of the thing

11:18.360 --> 11:24.000
I really like I mean is is in fact René friend having been involved with artists a lot gone to a lot of art galleries

11:24.000 --> 11:29.720
You can watch it in my rl streams on twitch some of which have been saved. I spoke coffee on myself as well. Well

11:31.280 --> 11:37.320
My wife my René French actually reminds me of my wife a little bit. She's got that whole art look going on and

11:39.080 --> 11:43.680
She's like really talented and you know, she's

11:45.560 --> 11:48.400
She wearing Rob Pike's glasses there that looks like

11:49.400 --> 11:52.680
It looks like she's wearing Rob Pike's glasses right there

11:53.200 --> 11:59.440
That's her favorite glasses issue. It's like they're wearing the same glasses or something Rob Pike would usually wear glasses like that

11:59.680 --> 12:01.680
So Rob Pike you made Go Lang

12:02.080 --> 12:07.760
One of the primary contributors to go Lang is made this this is like one of the very firsts to go Lang

12:07.760 --> 12:13.040
I absolutely love love love the artwork behind go Lang. It's probably one of my favorite

12:13.280 --> 12:22.360
The I mean as opposed to for example, like the logo for Java, which you know was never any good

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Where's the little guy? There he is

12:25.760 --> 12:32.040
Duke the Duke logo, you know, I'm just not impressed. It was fine. It was okay. It was the 1990s

12:33.520 --> 12:37.440
In terms of art and tech I do think they go well together. I

12:39.640 --> 12:42.200
Actually made the logo for Tomel

12:43.040 --> 12:48.640
I made it. I created it. I committed it. This is my logo

12:51.400 --> 12:56.520
True story you can actually go look at the commit if you go look at the commit on the GitHub, you'll see that I made it

12:57.360 --> 12:59.360
It was actually a joke

13:00.800 --> 13:03.840
It was kind of a joke I made a pull request I

13:04.680 --> 13:07.400
Made it seriously. I made her pull request

13:08.280 --> 13:12.440
You want to see it? You want it? This is my like my one of my few claims to fame

13:13.800 --> 13:16.440
I had to put it in a question for him in my stats of the ways

13:18.560 --> 13:20.560
Yeah

13:21.080 --> 13:29.080
Did you make the Tomel logo and the answer is yes, I did it's a very small claim to fame

13:29.480 --> 13:32.480
But if you go to github.com slash Tomel

13:32.480 --> 13:35.960
I also got Tom to kind of like pick up the pace

13:35.960 --> 13:39.400
I was kind of on him because I was making a thing called file system as a database

13:39.400 --> 13:41.400
which I still want to do with YAML this time and

13:42.320 --> 13:43.920
I

13:43.920 --> 13:46.000
Actually made Tomel Tomel spec

13:47.320 --> 13:54.320
To oopsie to try to get people to look it up again. It's not there anymore. Damn it. I wonder if it's on github at all

13:55.200 --> 13:56.520
It's a long time ago

13:56.520 --> 14:02.160
This is it's interesting because I had no idea about anything on Rust and I actually burnt sushi for example one of the

14:02.560 --> 14:07.500
The the pran the moderator and also one of the primary contributors to a lot of the Tomel parsing

14:07.500 --> 14:12.060
He wrote Burt's issue made one of the part when they want it made the Tomel parser. That's really popular for us

14:12.580 --> 14:16.300
He also resigned very very publicly and famously

14:16.940 --> 14:20.820
From the Rust project over quote and I quote you can go read the PR

14:22.180 --> 14:24.420
Hypocrisy among the Rust leadership

14:25.020 --> 14:29.500
You can go read it if you want to read the whole drama and so actually funny because I kind of you know

14:29.500 --> 14:33.380
Rub shoulders them a little bit while I was doing some of the Tomel parsing actually helped Tom Paletier

14:34.340 --> 14:39.860
Do some of the that the Tomel parser with some of the test code for Tom for for

14:40.300 --> 14:43.180
There's been super Susie's Tomel and again back then

14:43.180 --> 14:47.220
I was thinking that Tomel was the one true way to create a file system as a database

14:47.220 --> 14:49.220
We just have a directory and you put a Tomel file in there

14:49.980 --> 14:56.020
Recursively and you end up with kind of a flat file database that's structured. I still want to do something with that with yaml cherry and I

14:56.420 --> 15:03.360
Remember Ramirez. I forget her his or her name their name in the chat. We were talking about that the other day

15:04.780 --> 15:07.100
And something I'd still like to go but some polities

15:07.900 --> 15:12.500
Plenty is actually Tom Palletier is like one of the coolest people I have ever worked with an open source

15:13.460 --> 15:15.380
and

15:15.380 --> 15:16.460
because

15:16.460 --> 15:20.060
Tom actually it's like, you know what I've always wanted to write a parser

15:20.420 --> 15:25.380
I'm gonna write one and I'm gonna write it for Tomel and I think it's the I think it's better than Burt's issues

15:25.420 --> 15:26.940
But whatever

15:26.940 --> 15:31.500
And so actually evaluated it and this actually got me into writing my own parsers

15:31.860 --> 15:35.820
So there's a lot of parsers out there. There's a lot of people who like obsess about this kind of stuff

15:35.820 --> 15:39.860
So you can go out there and work with them. I do have some commits on here somewhere

15:39.860 --> 15:45.140
Maybe my contributions are not that big big enough to site. I mean, I actually made a separate

15:46.460 --> 15:51.580
Thing for the test code so it might be a separate repo that I did and I can't remember where it is

15:52.500 --> 15:55.560
Anyway, but yeah, let me show you that actual official commit to them

15:56.660 --> 15:58.660
to the Tomel project

15:58.940 --> 16:01.820
Tomel laying the Tomel. Yeah, there it is

16:04.100 --> 16:07.980
There it is there's my one commit to the Tomel project and

16:09.140 --> 16:12.820
You can actually find it if you try to go I can't even remember where

16:15.060 --> 16:20.100
Bob T logo, I mean, how would I put this I go through issues or code for requests

16:20.100 --> 16:22.540
I'm just showing off at this point. What kind of show is this?

16:23.060 --> 16:24.180
but

16:24.180 --> 16:28.900
I'm super proud of it. So there so let's go search for logo

16:31.260 --> 16:36.140
Alt Tomel logo change log Tomel has a logo. There we go

16:38.500 --> 16:41.000
What changes that was this one oh

16:43.260 --> 16:48.500
That wasn't me no, where is it Tomel has a logo. Oh, they put it in the change log

16:49.500 --> 16:55.060
Yeah, Tom Tom approved my pull request that that was the that was the thing I wanted to show you actually prove my

16:55.460 --> 16:59.940
My poor cause I was like super happy Tom made get him by the way like made it

17:00.620 --> 17:02.620
He also made gravator

17:02.620 --> 17:06.060
So he's a big deal over in Silicon Valley. He's also does his own thing these days

17:07.180 --> 17:11.420
You can read all of his there's some recent drama with somebody who worked with him on Twitter

17:12.100 --> 17:13.940
but whatever and

17:14.060 --> 17:16.980
Regiment js. Yeah, he's been a lot stuff. He's he's he's great

17:18.140 --> 17:19.420
and

17:19.420 --> 17:21.700
You know see all results I get a

17:22.380 --> 17:26.740
No, I where's my local commit. I'm gonna have to I want to find it. I hope they didn't delete it

17:26.740 --> 17:28.740
That was like that's like my

17:29.540 --> 17:31.380
My one small thing

17:31.380 --> 17:37.660
I don't even think I'm gonna register as a contributor because I was like my only contribution to the whole project ever and it was kind of a joke

17:38.460 --> 17:42.580
Seriously, it was a joke. I was like here. Okay. I'm gonna have to find it because it's a fun joke

17:42.580 --> 17:44.580
Is it logos?

17:45.100 --> 17:47.460
Yeah, is it? All right. Let me go find it. I

17:48.220 --> 17:51.980
Don't know if that's gonna know damn it. Of course. I have to do like Maine or whatever

17:53.820 --> 17:54.980
I

17:54.980 --> 17:59.220
Help me help me Obi-Wan Kenobi logos. Okay. This is yeah

17:59.940 --> 18:04.380
sink get attributes for Tom all Tom on PNG six years ago

18:05.820 --> 18:07.820
What?

18:08.820 --> 18:14.100
Uh history let's go look at the history added logos. Yay me

18:17.060 --> 18:19.060
I'm in a contribution

18:21.620 --> 18:25.700
Seriously, you know the feeling the first time you get one of your I don't care how sick I mean, you know

18:25.700 --> 18:28.820
Chris know this committing to the Linux kernel and I'm like making logos for Tom

18:29.380 --> 18:35.540
Same things. I mean in terms of like sick, you know, happiness, you know, so I like yeah, I did this added logo files

18:36.100 --> 18:40.140
Seriously, it was like it was like 1 a.m. Some night and I was like, you know what?

18:43.940 --> 18:47.020
Obviously everything is like everything is just a square bracket

18:47.020 --> 18:50.780
So let's just do this and then the PR is something. Where's the PR history?

18:51.580 --> 18:55.460
Where is this actually say the does it actually say it? Where's the PR?

18:55.460 --> 19:01.660
I don't I don't know get as well as I should I kind of do but not as well as I should

19:01.740 --> 19:08.420
I'm trying to look for the commit history because it said it said, you know, I won't care if you don't commit it

19:08.420 --> 19:10.420
It's just kind of fun

19:12.020 --> 19:15.300
Yeah, I don't I don't see like it's my comic got squashed or something. I

19:16.420 --> 19:21.700
Oh, I don't I don't I don't see it anymore. Let me see. Where's it? You know the feeling?

19:24.100 --> 19:25.780
Yeah

19:25.780 --> 19:27.420
Yeah, well

19:27.420 --> 19:33.600
So whatever, I mean Mike I did make a the PR wait pull request. Maybe it's in there. Oh, maybe it's in here

19:34.100 --> 19:36.100
It's close. It's it's close

19:38.020 --> 19:40.020
It's closed or an extra on

19:41.820 --> 19:44.020
Damn Rob

19:46.500 --> 19:48.500
Damn

19:51.180 --> 19:53.960
There's no record how far back to have to go

19:54.920 --> 20:02.440
Can have equals lost of I know I do feel lost. I mean how far back to have to go can I can I can I do a search?

20:05.640 --> 20:07.640
Logo oh

20:10.640 --> 20:16.800
There it is took a shot at logos. Yeah, my feelings won't be hurt if rejected figured what the hell

20:16.800 --> 20:21.840
That was so much fun

20:21.840 --> 20:26.000
I seriously it was like, you know, it was late at night. I'm like, what the hell? Let's just try this

20:26.000 --> 20:31.240
So because I was trying to get it to pick up steam. I actually created tumble dash spec

20:31.720 --> 20:37.720
Which I think didn't get picked up. I mean, but anyway, I really like it because now they use it for everything

20:37.720 --> 20:42.760
It's like all over now. You can go on the internet and search for tumble logos and I made it

20:43.240 --> 20:45.240
It's like my logo everywhere

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
So there are rust people

20:49.440 --> 20:54.280
Every time a rust comes out and the rest people come out to me like yelling me. Okay, but but but I made the Tomo logo

20:55.320 --> 20:59.920
Because you know rust uses Tomo. I mean rust can the rust contributors are like Bert Zushi in the gang

20:59.920 --> 21:04.560
I mean, they were like fundamental to the creation of Tomo and making sure it became cool and all

21:06.160 --> 21:12.680
There's many other cooler logos than mine, but it was just a shot at it. Look. Oh my god. It's even on Wikipedia

21:12.840 --> 21:14.840
My logo is on Wikipedia. I

21:15.720 --> 21:18.120
Can't stop. I just can't stop

21:20.440 --> 21:23.160
This is saying anything about the logo who made a logo

21:23.880 --> 21:27.400
To verbose that's true. That's why I don't use it. I use YAML these days

21:28.640 --> 21:32.400
It doesn't say anything about the history of the logo. I should like make a Wikipedia edit

21:33.480 --> 21:35.480
Where did the logo come from?

21:36.200 --> 21:42.720
Rob was bored on one random night. I know I should like edit it and add it. I should say I made the Tomo logo

21:43.440 --> 21:45.960
So, I mean, it's a small thing

21:46.600 --> 21:52.480
But it's the small thing. I should I do it right right now. I have to don't have the login or something

21:53.120 --> 21:56.040
Where should I put it? Where should I put it if I'm gonna do this?

21:57.040 --> 22:00.520
Shit, I'm scared. You're scaring me

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
I need to put like

22:06.680 --> 22:12.320
Criticism, it's like just criticism. Holy cow. Why don't we have history and then it's like the logo

22:13.720 --> 22:16.760
I'm kind of nervous because I don't do Wikipedia ever

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Example criticism see also external links at it

22:22.520 --> 22:25.400
I'm used to I I set up a Wikipedia

22:26.040 --> 22:32.000
Site for IBM when I was on my team there and now I feel like I don't know what I'm doing

22:32.280 --> 22:36.120
So it's probably not the thing to do during our Q&A session, but I don't have to come back

22:36.560 --> 22:38.520
I'll have to come back and add it. I tell it

22:38.520 --> 22:42.520
I'll put it I'll report a request to that to the community if there's anybody in the community

22:43.000 --> 22:48.880
Who actually knows how to do Wikipedia edits and has an account and has done so like reliably go go go add that

22:48.880 --> 22:50.880
I made the logo

22:55.440 --> 22:58.080
Put that on my tombstone made the Tomo logo

22:59.480 --> 23:01.200
When I die

23:01.200 --> 23:03.200
My greatest accomplishment

23:03.320 --> 23:08.680
Your email or something, you know, okay, not now, but maybe maybe someday

23:08.680 --> 23:13.920
I do need however to bookmark this. I put that in my little cast then. Yeah

23:14.520 --> 23:16.520
Zett create

23:16.920 --> 23:18.920
just a reminder I

23:20.880 --> 23:28.960
Create the Tomo logo. How do we get in this? I don't remember how we got we got an art. We got an art. That was it. Yeah, I

23:29.120 --> 23:31.360
I

23:31.360 --> 23:33.360
Did I made all the skill stack art?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.560
I made the van art

23:37.280 --> 23:39.280
oops wrong thing and

23:40.320 --> 23:41.600
Stuff

23:41.600 --> 23:43.680
So I actually love graphic design. I

23:45.000 --> 23:49.480
Don't spend nearly enough time doing it. I made like the can logo and some stuff

23:49.480 --> 23:54.880
I really really love graphic design. I particularly grab, you know, like icons and stuff like that

23:54.880 --> 23:57.880
That's something I really enjoy doing. I think it's a drafter in me

23:57.880 --> 24:01.320
I used to do a lot of drafting and map making for Dungeons and Dragons and stuff like that

24:01.840 --> 24:06.680
Do we have any other Dungeons and Dragons fans out there former players of Dungeons and Dragons or current?

24:07.440 --> 24:10.400
Because that really got me into that type of art

24:13.280 --> 24:15.480
So so yeah, I

24:16.480 --> 24:21.600
Was going to show you that the Instagram of that. I mean, I'm still this is still a question

24:21.840 --> 24:26.880
Oh, here's my wife's plate page. So I am married to Nicholas. I'm gonna say Nicholas to Doris Kappner

24:28.240 --> 24:31.920
Who is in the other room and insisted I have coffee with her today?

24:32.960 --> 24:35.600
Uh, oh boy movies get off that real quick. Um

24:36.720 --> 24:39.920
She is doing sculpture. She's obsessed with sculpture lately

24:40.720 --> 24:47.040
Uh, but yeah, and so being married to her is kind of nice because she's just she's not really interested in digital art

24:47.680 --> 24:50.480
Uh, and I kind of am I kind of obsessed with I've built

24:51.440 --> 24:54.560
Uh, you're talking about art, right? So I built ed tech retreat

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Uh, I get to brag about this. I guess

24:59.600 --> 25:02.720
Uh, I I in second life I built the entire thing

25:03.760 --> 25:08.800
Um, this I made this logo from scratch from scratch including the shading everything

25:08.800 --> 25:11.040
I was super proud of it. I made t-shirts with that logo on it

25:11.440 --> 25:15.440
I made a 3d rendition of the thing that like rotated over my head and blah blah blah

25:16.400 --> 25:18.400
I mean, this was a long time

25:18.880 --> 25:20.400
so

25:20.480 --> 25:24.320
I mean, this was really a long time ago. This is before my divorce

25:25.120 --> 25:28.400
Etc. We had dance parties. God, we had fun. We had so much fun

25:29.520 --> 25:32.080
And there's actually images of ed tech retreat

25:32.800 --> 25:36.480
Uh, so this that here this is the um

25:37.360 --> 25:40.720
architect rendering of the thing I eventually built in full

25:41.840 --> 25:44.320
Um, anyway, so there's like a flicker

25:45.360 --> 25:48.080
Feed on this. I mean you were asking about logos and art and stuff

25:49.040 --> 25:51.840
So that's kind of what triggered this

25:52.960 --> 25:57.200
Uh, there's no flicker feed for a tech retreat. That's so sad

25:57.840 --> 25:59.600
I feel bad

25:59.600 --> 26:01.680
I feel bad that all of our pictures are not there anymore

26:02.640 --> 26:05.120
I think there's like a twitter feed for that too

26:06.880 --> 26:09.600
Ed tech retreat

26:11.280 --> 26:16.080
Uh, that was an amazing creative endeavor. I really really like to oh we already hear

26:16.960 --> 26:18.960
Is it instagram? Maybe it's instagram

26:19.920 --> 26:21.440
Is it instagram?

26:21.440 --> 26:23.440
Instagram might have more things

26:23.600 --> 26:25.600
Okay, remember, I don't think there was an instagram back then

26:27.440 --> 26:30.000
We go we click we click on things and go to the different

26:31.680 --> 26:33.680
Amy I haven't seen her forever

26:34.640 --> 26:38.560
Uh, yeah all these amazing people that were educators

26:39.280 --> 26:41.280
And I got into education

26:42.160 --> 26:44.160
through

26:44.800 --> 26:51.120
Through this through twitter actually, uh, I wanted to get into education. I wanted to do more than just, you know work

26:52.240 --> 26:54.400
and couldn't find it but uh

26:55.840 --> 26:59.920
Ed tech retreat mohacks. This is my avatar

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
Custom had all reggae goes design nice

27:03.440 --> 27:08.880
Uh, jump ushaw jump ushaw. We actually paid this guy $3,200 to architect our island for us, and then I built it

27:09.920 --> 27:11.680
um

27:11.680 --> 27:13.360
but yeah

27:13.360 --> 27:17.120
I mean and that but you were talking about art. That's so I think that's where it came up

27:18.160 --> 27:21.120
Uh, I'm trying to I'm trying to find my

27:22.160 --> 27:26.400
Images, but I I think they're probably gone at this point. It's been so long ago

27:28.400 --> 27:30.880
Uh, yeah, nothing nothing here

27:32.720 --> 27:34.720
Nothing here, man. That's kind of crazy

27:35.520 --> 27:38.480
It's kind of crazy because there was so much stuff on there. We had like

27:39.440 --> 27:43.440
Lots of content, but it looks like it's all gone now. Anyway question

27:45.680 --> 27:48.640
What was the question question was

27:49.920 --> 27:54.560
Uh, what's your favorite favorite tech art anything related to goes little so I

27:56.080 --> 27:58.320
Yeah, I mean, that's that's my favorite. Um

27:59.360 --> 28:02.400
You know, I worked for Nike for a while and we did we did tech art there as well

28:02.480 --> 28:04.000
But nothing like that

28:04.080 --> 28:09.440
Tom a logo is the one this is my silly one that I made then I did a lot of art in second life in the 3d worlds

28:10.400 --> 28:12.400
Um, all right. So next question

28:13.920 --> 28:17.040
Uh, what is the cheapest homelab server I can buy so I actually

28:18.640 --> 28:20.640
Seated this question

28:20.720 --> 28:26.480
And because I've been getting this question a lot because I built a homelab server and I'm you know putting all my old hardware on there

28:26.480 --> 28:29.920
But we found the the hp z

28:30.800 --> 28:33.280
Uh, 640 and 600 series

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
to be by far

28:36.480 --> 28:39.200
Uh, the most affordable after a day of research

28:40.480 --> 28:43.200
So, uh, I actually bought this server

28:44.320 --> 28:49.200
And it's renewed. This is a different one. This is not the same one. This is only eight core

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
But you can get them

28:53.120 --> 28:55.120
For all kinds you can get them

28:55.440 --> 28:58.400
Uh, there's a 32 gigabyte memory. That's a smaller one

28:59.360 --> 29:03.760
Um, but yeah, I mean you can like stack them, right? So I actually have one

29:05.520 --> 29:08.240
Um, let me see if I can find it hp

29:10.080 --> 29:11.680
Yeah, here it is

29:11.680 --> 29:17.360
Uh, this is the actual one. Okay, and yes, the docs is my location. That's fine

29:17.920 --> 29:20.800
Um, so this okay, so

29:21.520 --> 29:24.880
Let me I have to tell you something about this. Okay. So this price tag

29:25.040 --> 29:28.400
2250 $2,252

29:29.040 --> 29:30.560
Includes

29:30.560 --> 29:33.120
Uh, and this is something I didn't notice at first. It includes

29:33.920 --> 29:35.360
um

29:35.360 --> 29:37.360
2 by

29:37.680 --> 29:40.240
This is the part I missed when I was looking at the specification

29:40.720 --> 29:48.480
You see the 2 by it says 2 by z on 14 core processors. This system I have for $2,300

29:49.520 --> 29:50.560
has

29:50.560 --> 29:52.560
28 cores

29:53.200 --> 29:55.200
That can be doubled

29:55.600 --> 29:58.640
28 dual cores. So so it has a total

29:59.360 --> 30:03.920
Of 56 possible cpu's when you're allocating virtual machines

30:05.280 --> 30:07.440
And it has 120 28 gigabytes

30:08.160 --> 30:11.200
Uh, which could be upgraded um ecc memory

30:12.400 --> 30:20.160
And 512 gigabyte solid state drive for $2,300 and I defy you to find anything that's cheaper than this

30:20.960 --> 30:23.600
So far it's been running really solidly. I have it over here running

30:24.080 --> 30:29.840
Uh, and I'll keep reporting on it, but this by far is the cheapest I was able to find

30:30.640 --> 30:36.320
Uh online. I I don't have any recommendations for any, uh, crypto of any kind. I don't do that stuff

30:37.200 --> 30:38.560
um, but

30:38.560 --> 30:40.400
but in terms of like

30:40.400 --> 30:46.320
Home lab and like instantly being able to make your own Kubernetes clusters or putting if you're going to do proxmox

30:46.320 --> 30:50.880
Just put it on here. Don't put it on anything above 14 nodes or your cluster will collapse like mine did

30:51.360 --> 30:54.560
And we'll get to that. Um, so this is a fantastic

30:55.520 --> 30:57.520
Uh way to go

30:57.920 --> 31:02.080
If if you want to do that, this is by far the cheapest thing I've ever found

31:03.120 --> 31:04.320
Uh

31:04.320 --> 31:08.720
Another there's another question. Why do you prefer linux as a subsystem within windows?

31:09.440 --> 31:10.560
uh

31:10.560 --> 31:12.560
I prefer

31:12.560 --> 31:17.120
Linux as a subsystem within windows because and I've answered this lots and lots of times

31:17.920 --> 31:20.240
But I will just give you the short answer

31:20.880 --> 31:22.240
because

31:22.240 --> 31:23.840
I stream

31:23.840 --> 31:24.800
game

31:24.800 --> 31:26.800
And I use windows at work

31:27.440 --> 31:31.760
Because they don't allow you to lose linux on your desktop at work and 99 of the places you're going to work

31:32.320 --> 31:34.320
You can't use linux on your desktop

31:35.200 --> 31:37.200
So that's the main reason

31:37.680 --> 31:40.960
Selfishly the main reason that I use windows for streaming and everything

31:41.440 --> 31:46.480
Is because the streaming tools and obs are over the top better than anything on linux

31:47.280 --> 31:49.440
Uh, you can't do it on linux. I did it for a year

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Uh, but it sucks

31:52.080 --> 31:58.960
And anybody who tells you differently is lying to you. They're told I can objectively rip down any argument that says

31:59.600 --> 32:03.040
That linux streaming is just as good as windows streaming. It absolutely is not

32:03.760 --> 32:06.640
Absolutely is not. Let's mention if you're going to do gaming

32:07.360 --> 32:14.000
Right and I know linux gaming has come a long way, but it is nowhere near windows gaming not even close

32:14.720 --> 32:19.040
So I do windows gaming and I haven't had a hiccup. I actually my windows machine

32:19.600 --> 32:20.640
Uh

32:20.640 --> 32:23.120
Goes stays running these days up to a month

32:23.840 --> 32:28.080
Uh, I don't have to reboot it for anything even if it has system things that says hey, you should probably reboot

32:28.080 --> 32:29.920
I'm like fine. I'm gonna wait

32:29.920 --> 32:35.360
And then so what I do is I run a virtual machine that's got a gigabyte surround and two or three cores

32:36.080 --> 32:42.800
Uh on side inside of my windows machine and then I ssh into it just like I would do if it were over there

32:43.840 --> 32:45.840
And in my new home lab

32:45.840 --> 32:50.160
Uh, I'm going to start doing that even more. In fact, they have the same name

32:50.240 --> 32:52.560
I have anton as the name is kind of a you know

32:53.360 --> 32:55.360
A nod to silicon valley

32:55.360 --> 33:00.080
And and I'm going to be sshing into anton, which is now living over here

33:00.480 --> 33:04.000
And we'll be on a ups and can run 24 seven blah blah blah blah

33:04.720 --> 33:08.640
And then I don't have to depend on a vm for anything, but it but it's kind of a stage, right?

33:08.640 --> 33:11.840
So, uh, if you don't have that if you don't have a server yet, then

33:12.560 --> 33:17.520
Um, you you might want to consider a virtual machine that's running a one-two server specifically

33:18.240 --> 33:23.760
Way better than red hat across the board for reasons. I'll talk about in a bit and

33:24.640 --> 33:26.240
um

33:26.240 --> 33:28.800
And and then I I just use windows for everything else

33:29.760 --> 33:32.400
And then my my work computer officially is a mac

33:32.960 --> 33:37.680
And I also have a mac so this whole bigotry about what computer you use

33:38.000 --> 33:41.040
You just need to get over it on my opinion because

33:41.840 --> 33:43.920
I mean mac hardware is top of the line

33:44.800 --> 33:45.760
and

33:45.760 --> 33:49.760
I mean and I actually might these mac minis are rock solid

33:50.320 --> 33:54.000
I have been running these mac minis in my cluster for

33:54.720 --> 33:58.160
Over three years and they are silent. They don't put out any heat

33:59.360 --> 34:03.040
They just are really really good hardware and they have just really great design

34:03.600 --> 34:05.920
So they're fantastic for for running linux

34:06.480 --> 34:12.400
Unfortunately red hat doesn't agree that linux the red hat linux should be run on a mac and so they decided to not support it

34:12.720 --> 34:16.240
Which is one of the reasons that I abandoned red hat and open shift

34:17.040 --> 34:19.760
um, and and I'm going to actually talk about that now

34:20.560 --> 34:22.560
so

34:23.760 --> 34:28.640
So in a nutshell I've been complaining about this a lot recently and I'm just going to go out and just going to say it

34:29.360 --> 34:30.560
um

34:30.560 --> 34:32.160
and

34:32.160 --> 34:35.840
By the way, if you get a chance to run linux on your desktop like I did at ibm for 12 years

34:36.560 --> 34:38.080
Go for it. It's a really great way

34:38.080 --> 34:42.000
I ran fedora on my desktop because I supported red hat at ibm

34:42.560 --> 34:45.120
For 10 or 15 years and I wrote

34:45.680 --> 34:49.680
rpm packages to install software. I know red hat inside and out

34:49.680 --> 34:52.640
I owned stock in red hat in 2002

34:53.200 --> 34:57.840
And sold it by the way after they did the whole fedora crap. So let me tell you a story

34:59.280 --> 35:02.800
I know you like it when I tell stories. So I'm going to tell you a story. How much time do I have?

35:04.320 --> 35:10.560
Uh, stories are easier for me to make my point. Okay, so way back when there was a company called

35:11.200 --> 35:15.120
Uh red hat. All right, so I think that red hat started when did they start anybody know?

35:15.920 --> 35:17.920
So red hat

35:18.560 --> 35:19.760
started

35:19.760 --> 35:23.520
When I want to say it was something like 99 98

35:24.640 --> 35:26.640
um

35:27.520 --> 35:29.520
Uh for more headquarters

35:31.040 --> 35:33.040
Uh, let's see opening

35:33.920 --> 35:37.600
American Subs today founded in 1993. Wow, really. Okay. That makes sense

35:38.160 --> 35:41.760
Yeah, because 93 94 that was when yeah, no, that's that sounds about right

35:41.920 --> 35:46.800
It sounds about right because that was when 94 wasn't when I got into the Linux really good. Actually. No, god. It was before that

35:49.280 --> 35:51.280
No, they must have been

35:51.360 --> 35:53.520
They must have it. No, they just weren't popular yet

35:54.240 --> 35:56.080
Okay, so here's the story

35:56.080 --> 36:02.320
So, you know travel in time with me back to the 1990s when Linux became a thing a big thing

36:02.640 --> 36:06.480
In fact, right before that unix was a big thing. Everybody was into

36:07.120 --> 36:11.600
Indigo colored, you know, 80s colored work stations that were nice and pretty

36:12.240 --> 36:15.200
And it was all about the work station. In fact, that led to

36:15.600 --> 36:19.520
Steve Jobs making next step, which was a work station

36:19.520 --> 36:25.040
It was all about work stations all about 3d as when Pixar was created and we would move past the pc

36:25.120 --> 36:26.800
We moved past pcs

36:26.800 --> 36:31.840
You know the max and the ibms and all that the people used to get worked on and accounting stuff and all that

36:32.320 --> 36:37.840
And we kind of moved into this new age of like work stations work stations were the cool thing

36:37.840 --> 36:45.040
These were these like 10 000 systems that sat on your desktop for doing 3d modeling and and drafting

36:45.440 --> 36:51.840
And you know, whatever. I mean like really amazing stuff right and that was also the dawn of the worldwide web

36:52.640 --> 36:55.840
So we started to see these things doubling as web servers and blah, blah, blah

36:55.920 --> 36:57.920
so you go back to that time and

36:59.600 --> 37:03.840
Unix was proprietary. There was a unix provider called Solaris

37:04.720 --> 37:09.680
Which was founded in stanford for free by the way, according to the stanford university policy

37:09.760 --> 37:12.160
Which says you can start up very interesting story

37:12.480 --> 37:17.840
If you want to see thank you for this something if you want to see the full story of Solaris

37:18.400 --> 37:24.480
I cannot recommend more. It's very boring, but recommend more triumph of the nerds 2.01

37:25.360 --> 37:30.720
Which goes through the creation of the internet and it talks about macabre, you know, the uh, what's his face?

37:31.280 --> 37:37.760
Uh, who started some microsystems and then you know, uh, he was I mean, it's it's there's a lot there to talk about

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
Either creation of ethernet and all of that

37:40.480 --> 37:45.840
So anyway, Solaris and sun microsystem who by the way, if you happen to recognize the name later invented java

37:46.560 --> 37:52.080
Uh, and then marketed it for 500 000 dollars the largest marketing budget of any language ever in history

37:52.560 --> 37:53.760
um

37:53.760 --> 37:57.040
Became a thing so the ellison it wasn't ellison. That was oracle

37:57.840 --> 38:01.600
Yeah, it was a completely different thing happening. It was very very proprietary

38:02.400 --> 38:04.240
No, Larry Ellison made oracle

38:04.240 --> 38:07.280
No, I'm I'm thinking of macafe the guys started three come

38:08.080 --> 38:10.080
Oh god, let me get his name

38:10.080 --> 38:11.200
uh

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
Who started he was part of the

38:13.840 --> 38:19.920
Uh, he was part of the original uh, palo alto crew at his iranx and then he's he forked off his own thing

38:20.880 --> 38:22.400
um

38:22.400 --> 38:24.400
And it's it's like escaping me

38:24.960 --> 38:30.480
Robert Metcalfe, that's it. It's not macafe. That's this that's the software guy. That's the security guy. It's Metcalf

38:30.800 --> 38:32.800
Robert Metcalfe 1979

38:32.800 --> 38:34.080
um

38:34.160 --> 38:35.760
so

38:35.760 --> 38:37.760
uh, okay, so

38:37.760 --> 38:38.960
anyway

38:38.960 --> 38:39.920
um

38:39.920 --> 38:41.920
In this atmosphere of like

38:42.240 --> 38:46.240
You know, we need to the AT&T unix was 3000 dollars a seat

38:46.640 --> 38:52.160
And so there was lots of stuff coming up. Berkeley made bsd. Berkeley, you know that at Berkeley. They made it

38:52.640 --> 38:57.360
Uh, there was lots of people experimenting at torwald's across the the world was experimenting with making

38:57.840 --> 39:01.120
Uh a replacement for minix, which was was college professor's colonel

39:01.520 --> 39:05.520
And that then he came up with linux, but they didn't have any way to talk to anybody else because there was no internet yet

39:06.880 --> 39:08.080
Yeah

39:08.080 --> 39:10.080
I think the stream dropped

39:10.400 --> 39:11.760
But it could be my internet

39:11.760 --> 39:16.400
Oh, I hope I hope not and please confirm for anybody else that the stream is dropped. I I still see

39:17.120 --> 39:19.120
I see a a red bit rate

39:19.920 --> 39:21.920
Says he went offline

39:22.400 --> 39:25.200
Uh, but i'm not offline. It says i'm still streaming

39:25.760 --> 39:27.760
Going up and now you're back to zero viewers

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
Yeah, what's up with that?

39:31.920 --> 39:34.560
It dropped 30 seconds. It's back

39:37.200 --> 39:39.200
That is really weird

39:40.480 --> 39:42.480
Um, is it back?

39:43.920 --> 39:49.600
I mean, uh, yeah, it's back now. It is back now. Okay. Well, thankfully that'll still be on the youtube

39:50.080 --> 39:52.080
Mostly just me talking, but thank you

39:52.800 --> 39:54.800
Uh, you dropped for me

39:55.680 --> 39:58.800
Yeah, I don't know what dropped. I can't begin to

39:59.520 --> 40:02.880
Guess maybe it's my server. I don't know. We'll see probably not, but

40:04.000 --> 40:08.720
Everybody back. Okay. So so anyway, let me finish the story. So, uh, at the time

40:11.600 --> 40:14.400
You know, people were thinking about different versions of unix and everything

40:15.280 --> 40:16.320
and

40:16.320 --> 40:18.720
So there was slack where there were lots of options

40:19.680 --> 40:24.560
And one of the biggest ones early on the alternative the unix was solaris, which is proprietary

40:24.560 --> 40:28.640
But it was still kind of freeform and everybody loved it because they had a better attitude

40:29.120 --> 40:32.080
And but they were still proprietary and at the same time

40:32.400 --> 40:35.760
Linux kind of became a thing because it's like no, we really want something that's free

40:36.400 --> 40:39.840
and it was actually, uh, the guy who taught me about unix

40:40.320 --> 40:42.720
Who I said, man, I wish I had this at home and he turned he goes well

40:42.720 --> 40:45.680
He can always run linux and so I started running linux at home

40:46.480 --> 40:47.520
and

40:47.520 --> 40:48.720
um

40:48.720 --> 40:53.280
And at the time there weren't that many options that I had a power pc mac because I was doing web design and thing

40:53.760 --> 40:56.080
And so I I ended up doing mock linux

40:56.800 --> 41:00.960
Later I would get a p2 opinion and I would end up running

41:01.520 --> 41:04.880
Slackware for a while and then I would try mandrake linux, which is susie

41:05.200 --> 41:08.880
And eventually I would use red hat and red hat came out when red hat came out on the scene

41:09.680 --> 41:11.680
It was a big deal

41:12.480 --> 41:19.120
Red hat was a huge deal and it was probably the most important free, uh distribution on the planet

41:20.000 --> 41:24.560
Now fast they promised, you know, that they were going to support everything and and everything in it

41:25.040 --> 41:27.040
And that was really great. Everybody was really behind it

41:27.600 --> 41:33.200
Uh, and then 2002 or something came around and they decided to make fedora and they said look we're going to make

41:33.840 --> 41:37.920
Uh red hat proprietary in other words, we're going to sell it for the to the enterprise

41:38.480 --> 41:40.320
Uh, and we're not going to release red hat

41:41.040 --> 41:43.280
for use by the the community, but

41:44.000 --> 41:47.760
We're going to make this thing called fedora so people can volunteer their time and effort

41:48.080 --> 41:53.040
And build up fedora and we can steal all of their innovation put it into our product and sell it

41:53.760 --> 41:58.640
Because that's what they did and at the time there was a major major

41:59.520 --> 42:00.880
like

42:00.880 --> 42:02.880
Backlash against red hat

42:03.440 --> 42:06.800
I mean, it was a serious backlash anybody that's that old might remember it

42:07.360 --> 42:13.600
Um, but they were a disaster. I mean, they were a disaster of a company making horrible decisions

42:14.080 --> 42:16.560
Moving into I mean not horrible decisions

42:16.640 --> 42:19.920
Maybe decisions that were in their best interests that we're going to make them a lot of money, which it did

42:20.640 --> 42:23.280
And they became the standard distribution for enterprise

42:24.080 --> 42:26.080
And everybody else was like man, we want to do that too

42:26.640 --> 42:29.600
So that was pretty much the first open core company

42:29.920 --> 42:33.200
That's a term coined by git lab, which means their product is open source

42:33.200 --> 42:35.360
But they make money on it on the side by all their

42:36.000 --> 42:42.800
Proprietary add-ons and if you really want to get into this go watch dalman talk about all the little proprietary crap that they

42:43.280 --> 42:49.040
Inject into linux in order to stick their hooks into enterprise and make them pay big subscription rates and stuff

42:49.680 --> 42:53.040
So and that you might be fine with that, you know, you might be fine with that

42:53.040 --> 42:55.200
But that is not the linux way

42:55.200 --> 42:59.760
It is not the fos and open source way and there was a massive backlash against it

43:00.000 --> 43:06.560
But nobody cared because red hat was making gobs and gobs of money because it was bringing linux into the enterprise and to this day

43:07.280 --> 43:09.520
red hat is still so

43:10.400 --> 43:15.040
deeply deeply embedded in the enterprise that ibm bought them for 30 something billion

43:15.680 --> 43:22.640
And now consider changing their name for a moment. Apparently that's that's the rumor to red hat because it was so significant

43:22.640 --> 43:28.480
So now ibm, you know, who brags every year about how many software patents it has

43:29.040 --> 43:33.280
And keeps back engineers from becoming distinguished engineers unless they don't get a patent

43:33.680 --> 43:39.440
Who lied to me in the 1999 with the peace love and linux campaign or to get me in the door and then turns out

43:39.440 --> 43:41.680
It's all a bunch of bullshit

43:41.680 --> 43:45.200
That company is the company that now owns and operates red hat

43:45.200 --> 43:51.760
And if you think for a second that red hat is ever going to do anything in the best interests of the overall linux community

43:51.920 --> 43:57.200
You'd be mistaken as a company individual engineers at red hat will

43:58.000 --> 44:02.160
There's many many individual engineers and they support open source and they're doing amazing things

44:02.720 --> 44:03.520
uh

44:03.520 --> 44:08.880
The most controversial linux commit that ever happened in my history is system d

44:09.520 --> 44:15.440
The guy who invented it invented it at red hat for the sake of enterprise because enterprise had a specific need

44:16.320 --> 44:22.080
And they said that they had a specific need and they made it and they pushed it in and they got it in all of enterprise

44:22.080 --> 44:26.880
And now it's in a bun tune. It's in everything else. It's highly controversial. I'm actually still okay with it

44:27.280 --> 44:32.080
Slightly the guy that made it by the way. I guess where he went he quit from red hat and he went he works for microsoft now

44:33.120 --> 44:36.880
Which if I if you know anything about the history of linux

44:37.120 --> 44:43.280
The idea that the lead engineer the person who got death threats for creating system d is now working for microsoft

44:44.320 --> 44:49.760
I mean, it's all I have to say about that and you just know what i'm talking about now microsoft ironically has moved forward

44:49.920 --> 44:54.000
And they are more pro linux than I think sometimes even red hat is

44:54.560 --> 44:56.640
I mean, you know, they're doing they're still very proprietary

44:56.640 --> 44:59.840
But the the point is is that all of these companies that said that

45:00.160 --> 45:05.280
Balmers words exactly that linux is a viral operating system and any company is crazy to install it

45:06.080 --> 45:10.080
Are all like changing their tune and saying oh linux is awesome. We're going to do it

45:10.960 --> 45:14.320
Uh, do you think non non system d distros are a big deal? I don't know

45:15.360 --> 45:20.240
Uh, I don't know. I I don't think you can get away without system d reasonably

45:20.320 --> 45:23.760
There's no motivation behind it if you're going to do that you might as well just go bsd

45:24.080 --> 45:28.480
And there's a lot of software that there's a lot of like, you know routers and stuff that use it still so

45:29.280 --> 45:34.480
Uh, nobody knows the system d a system d replace it replace the init system that it's kind of

45:34.960 --> 45:39.920
And there's many advantages of it and disadvantages the advantages are you have this monolithic startup system

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
That's not really unixy

45:42.000 --> 45:46.160
Um, but it has you know state so it can keep track of things better

45:46.720 --> 45:52.160
Uh, it can be more secure and but it you know at the cost of being this big monolith that has to be deployed

45:52.240 --> 45:56.240
It has all control to the whole system. It's a very very controversial thing

45:56.800 --> 46:02.640
That controversy has largely passed though and it's now the standard in all enterprise linux distros

46:03.120 --> 46:09.520
Uh, so uh, but bsd unix which is still the primary distro used in router software

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
And stuff like that does not use it

46:12.400 --> 46:17.440
Uh, and it still uses the traditional init system. So you have to go do your own research on that. Um,

46:18.160 --> 46:19.200
I

46:19.200 --> 46:22.480
I don't really don't have an opinion on that. I do think

46:23.280 --> 46:29.040
That we kind of have to make some, you know con concessions. I mean cononical and shuttleworth taught us that

46:29.600 --> 46:34.400
That the linux world has to make concessions with the enterprise community if we're going to move linux forward

46:34.720 --> 46:40.640
So it's kind of a delicate dance. You have to you know make in order to to to walk that middle line

46:41.200 --> 46:45.440
But red hat is clearly not and this is this is the tipping point for me. Okay

46:46.400 --> 46:48.560
And I know the question was about open shift and I'll get to that

46:48.560 --> 46:52.000
But the question the the question is about, you know, red hat and open shift

46:52.000 --> 46:58.640
So this weekend and I wrote about this so might as well if you want to go read about it this weekend. I I installed

46:59.760 --> 47:02.480
Red hat on my mac mini, okay

47:02.880 --> 47:03.840
And I was like, okay

47:03.840 --> 47:08.000
I installed rocky linux and uh, which is you know red hat and I went through all the problems

47:08.000 --> 47:12.560
It's got a horrible graphic installer. I mean, it's disastrously bad compared to a bunch of server

47:12.960 --> 47:18.720
A bunch of server install is so stinking slick. I just don't have words for how good it is

47:18.800 --> 47:22.400
And I have been using that my whole life. I mean recently and so then I go

47:22.480 --> 47:25.600
So then I try to do red hat and red hat just falls on its face

47:26.080 --> 47:30.800
It can't do certain things. It doesn't have this other thing. It doesn't have this other thing and

47:31.520 --> 47:36.000
Uh, no, I installed rocky linux not red has enterprise linux. Do they have a different installer?

47:37.120 --> 47:39.120
If they have it if there's a different installer

47:39.520 --> 47:41.520
With then I will have to eat my hat

47:41.760 --> 47:46.560
And go do red hat enterprise linux installer instead of rocky linux installer. Either way

47:47.200 --> 47:49.440
Uh, the issue that I hit after that

47:50.160 --> 47:52.480
Uh, still applies. So

47:53.280 --> 47:56.480
We hit an issue and I actually wrote about this in my zettelcast and you go read it

47:57.440 --> 47:58.720
where

47:58.720 --> 48:02.160
Um, I found a forum on red hat that said

48:02.960 --> 48:06.400
Do all of these things if you want to get your mac mini to work

48:07.280 --> 48:10.560
With red hat with red hat networking stuff and it was, you know, totally doable

48:10.640 --> 48:15.360
It was just quite a bit of stuff and I have like 19 of these things that I have to set up

48:15.760 --> 48:18.320
And I was going to have to go through all of these individual steps for all of them

48:19.040 --> 48:21.280
And you know red hat tries to have a smart install

48:21.280 --> 48:27.760
But it really sucks compared to cloud in it and stuff like it in in canonical and you know in in ubuntu

48:27.920 --> 48:32.880
It's not even the same. In fact ubuntu could be cited as the the standard for

48:33.920 --> 48:35.920
cloud-based, you know

48:36.000 --> 48:40.560
operating system initialization cloud in it is by far the industry standard for that and

48:41.280 --> 48:45.840
So anyway, so red has got this other answer and in the forum thread

48:46.800 --> 48:51.520
Somebody says well, this is on a mac and the the the person officially representing red hat

48:52.080 --> 48:54.560
Basically threw him under the bus and said

48:55.280 --> 48:58.640
Oh, well, that's mac hardware. We don't we don't ever test on anything on mac

48:59.600 --> 49:06.000
And and the reason that that offends a guy like me who was alive and owned red hat stock in 2000

49:06.960 --> 49:08.560
2001

49:08.560 --> 49:11.600
And eventually sold it when they did the whole fedora thing is because back then

49:12.320 --> 49:18.400
Red hat promised the world that they were just as much a member of the overall linux community as everybody else

49:19.200 --> 49:24.400
That they were going to maintain that love and support for linux on all hardware, you know

49:24.480 --> 49:32.480
And that we were going to continue with the mission of empowering old hardware with new linux distro installations and

49:33.200 --> 49:37.680
Recycling, you know old computers, which is all I mean that this is the core values

49:38.240 --> 49:42.320
Of linux if you're in the linux community, those are our core values

49:42.720 --> 49:48.000
That we we have choice we get to say what we want to do we can we can make it so that it runs on any hardware

49:48.400 --> 49:52.480
And to be fair red hat still does run it just takes all this extra work

49:52.720 --> 49:57.520
And so for red hat official people to say we really don't care about you if you're running on mac

49:57.920 --> 50:04.240
Is basically just them confirming what everybody has known all along would end up happening in 2022

50:04.400 --> 50:10.080
The only thing they care about is enterprise period. It's in the name red hat enterprise linux

50:10.400 --> 50:16.080
There's no such thing as anything but enterprise them because people don't run mac minis in the enterprise because that would be silly

50:16.400 --> 50:18.400
There's actually a lot of people who do

50:18.400 --> 50:21.760
They're fantastic home lab machines, by the way, they're much more powerful than a raspberry pi

50:21.920 --> 50:26.960
They have better hardware and they're cheaper than a lot of mainframe, you know other big systems

50:27.200 --> 50:31.120
And if you're not going to do virtualization and you want an actual hardware instance, they're actually pretty good for that

50:31.680 --> 50:35.200
So, you know as long as they have intel chips in them and they have one thing is a whole different question

50:35.200 --> 50:36.560
We don't even go there

50:36.560 --> 50:39.840
So but you know, there's no plan for them to support it

50:39.840 --> 50:44.400
But but the the arrogance of them to just say oh, we don't care about mac people

50:45.040 --> 50:47.120
That just really upset me and frankly

50:47.840 --> 50:50.960
You know, if I am an enterprise cto, I'm not going to care about that either

50:50.960 --> 50:55.120
I'm like, no, I'm really happy that you're spending all of your money and time and energy

50:55.520 --> 50:59.360
Supporting my hardware. Why would you even dream of wasting your energy?

50:59.520 --> 51:04.480
You know making sure to test your distribution on any mac hardware at all. That's a waste of your time

51:05.200 --> 51:07.360
And if I'm an enterprise cto, I agree with that

51:08.080 --> 51:10.800
But I'm not an enterprise cto. I'm a guy running a home lab

51:11.440 --> 51:13.040
and I'm I'm

51:13.040 --> 51:18.480
Taking all of the hardware that I have and there is a company that has values that are consistent with that

51:18.880 --> 51:25.440
And that's canonical. You can you can throw them under the bus all you want, but the name ubuntu means what does it mean?

51:26.640 --> 51:28.640
What does ubuntu mean?

51:30.800 --> 51:33.440
And if I don't we're in short ubuntu has a few meanings when used as a

51:33.920 --> 51:39.920
As a naguni bantu term ubuntu means humanity. However, it is sometimes translated as I am because we are

51:40.240 --> 51:45.600
So the diagram of ubuntu is, you know, the logo is like all these arms and arm and arm

51:46.160 --> 51:52.320
And you know canonical has done some weird things. They are a company as well, but the company values have never changed

51:52.880 --> 51:57.600
I mean, they're just as relevant in the enterprise microkates and all the stuff that they're doing

51:58.160 --> 52:01.440
Uh, and and they're doing, you know, like really really amazing things

52:02.240 --> 52:07.680
And so they're you know, I haven't seen about red hat red has become the apple of linux

52:08.400 --> 52:10.900
red hat really has become the apple of linux

52:12.640 --> 52:14.240
They

52:14.240 --> 52:16.800
They want to say that they're doing free stuff. They really don't care

52:16.880 --> 52:20.000
They're just catering to the enterprise and they just need to come clean and own it

52:20.720 --> 52:24.320
Um, and then everybody else can make that decision if you want to be relevant in the enterprise

52:24.560 --> 52:28.640
But I tell you what there's a lot of enterprises that are picking that are avoiding red hat

52:29.280 --> 52:35.040
And so the reason and I actually don't like open shift for all the same reasons red hat and open shift

52:35.280 --> 52:37.760
Have done everything in their power to lock you in

52:38.400 --> 52:40.400
to their product

52:40.400 --> 52:42.480
and um

52:42.480 --> 52:44.480
so

52:44.560 --> 52:48.320
No, it's not like 10. No, I don't know. So the um

52:49.680 --> 52:51.600
So the the problem the problem we have

52:52.320 --> 52:55.760
Is that we have an enterprise operating like an enterprise

52:56.400 --> 52:57.360
with

52:57.360 --> 53:03.040
all of its priorities which are to lock you in and create systems that you depend on completely

53:03.600 --> 53:06.880
And they've very openly but they've been very open about doing that and they

53:07.360 --> 53:09.360
They're trying to do that and for I don't want that

53:10.080 --> 53:16.080
I don't want that a bottom line. I I want open standards and red hat can tell you all they want about open standards

53:16.160 --> 53:18.160
But as long as they control the standard

53:18.400 --> 53:22.400
And and they have been doing that. I mean and they've done some good things. I mean bilda was great

53:22.880 --> 53:27.840
It took red hat to kind of go at it proprietary wise with docker. Docker was also one of these companies

53:27.840 --> 53:32.000
I want to lock you in they just proved it by forcing everybody to pay for their enterprise product

53:32.240 --> 53:33.520
Docker desktop

53:33.520 --> 53:37.760
So they've always been a company and they haven't really given a crap about free and open source software at all

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
At the end of the day, they're a company and they need to make money

53:40.720 --> 53:44.160
And there's people there's people in the company who like to believe that they

53:44.640 --> 53:47.760
Have the the needs of the open source community at heart

53:48.000 --> 53:50.320
But then when they force everybody who's already got

53:50.640 --> 53:53.920
desktop linux on their enterprise systems to pay money because it's a big

53:54.240 --> 53:56.240
You know behemoth enterprises got the money

53:56.640 --> 54:00.800
Then you see their true colors show and they there's nothing wrong with them making money

54:00.800 --> 54:05.520
They're actually legally bound to make money. That's part of what being an s-corp or a c-corp is

54:06.160 --> 54:07.200
But

54:07.200 --> 54:11.200
They just need to own that they are no longer free and open source. They really don't care

54:11.920 --> 54:13.920
They care about making money and so

54:14.480 --> 54:17.200
I know i'm going kind of off the off the edge here, but

54:18.560 --> 54:22.000
People know that i've been kind of in the middle of the road when it comes to like

54:22.640 --> 54:28.240
corporate enterprisey conservative kind of you know, you know values and ethos and you know

54:28.560 --> 54:35.600
Really really off the deep end fsf kind of like if you're not using gpl v3, you're the devil and should be cancelled

54:36.320 --> 54:38.720
You know, and i'm kind of in the middle there

54:39.840 --> 54:45.200
But this whole experience with my lab has kind of shifted me back towards the fsf side

54:45.600 --> 54:50.160
Not quite i'm more like torval torval's is kind of dead center in the middle of it

54:50.720 --> 54:57.360
Uh, you know, he understands the needs of corporations and thinks you gpl v3 is the devil and I agree, but but

54:58.080 --> 55:00.400
You know, he would not go so far as to say

55:00.880 --> 55:03.040
Everybody should put red hat on all their computers

55:03.760 --> 55:07.760
You know, he stays out of that fight completely mostly by focusing on the kernel architectures and stuff

55:08.320 --> 55:13.360
So that's a pretty long rant, but I I feel like I owe it to everybody

55:13.680 --> 55:15.680
Let's see if we can change the tone up a little bit though

55:16.320 --> 55:19.760
Uh, the open nature of linux and proliferation of distros saves us a lot. I I agree

55:20.560 --> 55:24.720
And you know and and somebody let me let me show you another symptom of this, okay

55:25.040 --> 55:30.720
So somebody said to me today, uh lbg, I think it was, you know, who's fond of reminding me of stuff that I forget

55:30.800 --> 55:32.400
Which is always good

55:32.400 --> 55:35.200
They said, well, we would be nowhere in the container space

55:35.920 --> 55:37.920
Uh, if it weren't for red hat

55:38.640 --> 55:43.440
And and and lbg told me about this site github.com slash containers

55:44.160 --> 55:48.000
Do you see any indication on this site that this site is red hat the company?

55:49.520 --> 55:51.520
There's none

55:51.680 --> 55:57.680
You have to like dig. There's no official statement that this that this website is from red hat

55:58.000 --> 56:02.320
Why doesn't red hat put red hat in their github container and their github name?

56:04.080 --> 56:06.080
Because they know

56:06.080 --> 56:11.520
That's what I think I think it's because they know they know if they were to put github.com slash red hat and nobody would open it

56:14.000 --> 56:15.840
And so yeah, I have a look at nix's pretty cool

56:16.560 --> 56:21.120
So so no so they they went to github.com containers. There is no way for you to know

56:21.840 --> 56:24.880
And and let's see you and they started as soon as you start looking at the technology list

56:24.880 --> 56:31.040
You're like realizing hmm pod man. Oh build a scopio. What the hell? This is red hat

56:32.560 --> 56:34.000
Right

56:34.000 --> 56:36.480
And then you start to realize and then you start to look at the names here

56:36.480 --> 56:38.720
You get there's a guy with a red hat. Just hope he was awesome

56:39.280 --> 56:42.480
I mean look as I said the people at red hat are awesome the company

56:45.680 --> 56:49.840
Right so just said he's really awesome software engineer at red hat

56:50.160 --> 56:53.120
You know and the rest of them they're not going to tell you where they work

56:53.200 --> 56:56.240
I mean, you know who they were if you know you know names so you can look at them

56:56.800 --> 56:59.840
So so this this is a good. This is a good example of red hat

57:00.320 --> 57:07.120
Trying to hide the fact that they're red hat because they don't want to be associated with all the things red hat has become associated with

57:07.920 --> 57:10.880
And and that includes filming their nose at

57:11.520 --> 57:16.240
Anything that they don't like or any any of the the other part of the linux distribution

57:16.240 --> 57:20.640
They the red hat is one of the worst linux citizens. They are the apple of linux

57:21.440 --> 57:26.240
They and as far as I'm concerned. I don't want anything to do with red hat ever again

57:26.880 --> 57:31.600
Uh in terms of a distribution and as a company I I will still use their their

57:32.240 --> 57:34.240
Contributions because I have to

57:34.240 --> 57:36.240
I can't avoid them

57:36.480 --> 57:39.200
Because I don't you know, I don't have a say they don't care what I say

57:39.760 --> 57:43.680
They you know so build a pod man and things and they'll continue to make stuff that

57:44.320 --> 57:49.280
You know is used out there and I still think that there's stuff that you just like apple. I use apple products, right?

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
But I hate apple

57:52.240 --> 57:55.680
I know I it's hard not being a hypocrite. I mean, how are you going to get work done if you don't use it?

57:56.960 --> 58:00.400
So it's like, you know, it doesn't mean I have to like it, right?

58:01.280 --> 58:02.960
so um

58:02.960 --> 58:09.280
Anyway, uh speaking of things I I come to not like recently. I know this is a very ranty night

58:09.920 --> 58:14.720
Today, but I I I feel like I I mean I wasted a lot of time this weekend on stuff that I wish I hadn't

58:15.360 --> 58:18.240
Uh, and I wish I had thought through a little bit better

58:18.880 --> 58:21.520
Uh, so open shift is as everybody knows is kubernetes

58:22.320 --> 58:24.320
Is red hats variation on kubernetes?

58:24.800 --> 58:29.760
Uh, it has some very good things in it. It it it to be completely honest though

58:30.320 --> 58:36.320
The biggest difference between red hat and canonical is red hat over engineers everything

58:37.280 --> 58:44.560
And they're brilliant the red hand engineers are brilliant and they over engineer shit and they don't make it usable

58:45.040 --> 58:48.480
It's it's one of their regular problems and canonical

58:49.120 --> 58:54.320
Is really really good at simplifying and thinking about usability

58:54.880 --> 59:01.120
But they sometimes lack the engineering expertise that red hat has and what would be really great is that we could get the middle of that

59:01.360 --> 59:07.760
You know, I just wish that they had done that they had done that I wish and and canonical's got great engineers

59:07.760 --> 59:13.280
I'm gonna be wrong but but the the reason that I want to promote canonical and ebuntu is because

59:13.760 --> 59:15.760
Their products have always been

59:16.560 --> 59:21.520
You I mean to a fault. I mean snap comes to mind, right? Uh, have always been

59:22.160 --> 59:25.440
Like focused on usability above everything else

59:26.160 --> 59:35.040
Uh, if they over it I I happen to think that over engineering is a sign of a somebody you don't want to work with

59:36.160 --> 59:37.680
but that's

59:37.680 --> 59:40.880
There's there are people there are people there are engineers in this world

59:40.880 --> 59:44.320
And you know if you've been around for any amount of time there are engineers in this world

59:44.480 --> 59:49.920
Who think that the most over engineered complex solution is the best one because only smart people understand it

59:50.640 --> 59:52.640
And I cannot overstate

59:53.040 --> 59:59.600
How stupid that is and how that person those type of engineers should be weeded out and fired immediately

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:07.840
The it is so complicated that the most brilliant people are the ones you can take a highly complex system

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.440
And turn it into something that can be some simplicity

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.560
Uh, uh lock ins are depressing

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.760
My my we have a comment here. My actual and first job is pushing me towards learning open shift on top of already existing

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.600
I've been products the lock ins are depressing. They are they're depressing and so look

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.880
I had a choice in my home lab and in my personal life

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.320
Uh to say look, I I do not need or want to learn red hat

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.160
And and I don't want to stay current. I mean the argument for me to put it on there was hey

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.720
I'm going to stay current. I'll be able to get a good job. I get my r.h.c. You know

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.040
I'll be good to go if I want to be an infrastructure engineer

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.600
And if you if you want to be an infrastructure engineer today

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.640
I'm very sad to report that you cannot be one if you don't know red hat

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.320
You have to know it

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.840
But there is a certain percentage of jobs out there that people are hiring

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.920
Hiring either container-based or dev ops or cloud native and there are some

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.600
Big shops. I imagine I haven't seen any that actually use a bunch of server and I have a choice

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.200
And my choice is to prepare for those jobs

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.440
Even if that job is way way way harder for me to find and this goes for rusted go and I don't I just to compare it

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.720
I you know, I had I once advised somebody who ended up getting a job in influx db doing go programming

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.400
Get well some new rust

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.560
Uh, I I told him point blank. I said, you know

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.880
It you go for it. Go for it. Go. I you guys won't believe this about me

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.120
But I actually encourage this guy to go find a rust job. I said, look, you you know, it's gonna you're gonna have to sacrifice

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.600
You might have to move to germany. There's lots of like rust jobs in germany

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.120
um

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.320
But you know if if that's your real passion then you're gonna have to make a sacrifice and find a company that has it

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.920
And he came in one day on his own to me without me saying anything

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400
He says I'm starting to think that I should learn go

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.200
So I can get the job and then I can just have rust and do that on the side until it gets big

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.840
And he got six how he got the job. That's exactly how he got the job

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.280
Because in all of influx db isn't go except for flux the flux language, which is in rust

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.520
They ended up getting a job working on that

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760
The point is that

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.160
You don't have to pick

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.080
Uh, the mainstream stuff esxi. I mean

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.640
You know, you don't have to pick those things

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.200
Uh, I'm gotten older

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:23.120
So I my picks are largely in line and training you as largely in line with what's going to get you an immediate job

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.560
But sometimes especially like right now

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.520
You know, you have the choice to say

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.440
You know, I don't need to give in on that for example

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.320
If I want to use Linux on the desktop if you want to lose Linux on the desktop and you don't want to work anywhere

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.760
That doesn't let you do that

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.520
You can filter out 80 of the companies out there and you can say look

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.560
I don't want to work for any company that is too stupid to not let me use Linux on my desktop

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.400
And I used to I used to joke with my old manager. He's gone now. He left you retired

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.240
But I used to joke with him after he hired me

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.400
I was like, you know, if I had asked that one question

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.360
I would never have taken this job because they forced me to use a macro windows

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.880
And I after being using Linux on the desktop for 12 years

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.640
And I adapted and I'm using vmware now and everything but

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.520
But seriously if you're interviewing

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.160
You can choose I guess that's the point I'm making you can choose to say

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.480
No

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.080
And you can there's never been a time when you could be more picky, especially if you're good

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.320
You can say look, I I don't you know, no, you're gonna make me you're gonna make me use windows every day. Goodbye

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.200
There's like, you know, 10 other people down the street that will hire me

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.480
I mean, but you have to make your own decisions if you want to make your

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.960
Chances for working in a place

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.560
A lot of jesson qualifiers, you know, they use it on the server, of course

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.560
Uh, and you know, but but you can you can do the same thing you can make a choice

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.320
You can say I don't work want to work for any company that uses red hat servers

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.840
Right, you can do that

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:59.120
That's a very very very tiny list of companies that you'll work for and you'll be eliminating most of the fortune 500

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.920
Uh, but

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.880
You can do it. You can do that. You know, it's your choice

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.000
Uh, you could you could say, you know, whatever so

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.280
that you anyway, um

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.320
Uh, that that's kind of uh, that topic. Let me let me see if I can save some of these

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.960
I mean, we do we were a little bit late. So I'll try to to bump bump through the rest of these questions really quickly

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.600
A desktop too. Yeah

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.760
Uh, why did I bend a proxmox? So

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:32.560
People have been watching me do my uh, home lab and it stuff

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.480
and

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.280
uh

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.800
proxmox

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.200
I I did not know this when I got into it. I really wish I had I wrote a lot about it in my zed if you want to read it

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:46.560
Uh, the the short answer is uh proxmox maximum that maximum nodes in a cluster is 32

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:53.520
Uh, I got the 14 nodes in my cluster and proxmox started falling on its face in ways that I won't go into detail on

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.360
Uh, it just could not the coral sink could not keep everything updated

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.520
Uh, I had caching problems because the icons were not getting refreshed properly

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:08.320
And all the problems I was having were confirmed by tons and tons of forum posts on proxmox from the people having the same problem

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.680
and

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.520
uh, everybody

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.400
Um

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:19.280
That I ask who says proxmox works great for them. It has like less than five nodes usually just one node and and they use it

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:26.000
So, uh, I mean I was already kind of leery of the whole afero gpl v3 license that proxmox was released under

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.960
Uh, and the whole use of you know dependency on a web interface

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.840
I mean, I did like it. It was it was super pretty

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.800
Uh, but it's definitely not necessary. And so

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.640
After I hit those problems, I was like now proxmox is out of here

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:45.280
And and then another another problem too is that I noticed that all of my four gigabyte mac minis gave up

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.640
1.2 gigabytes of ram just to running the proxmox

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.120
uh agent

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.200
That's true story

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.200
Just to run the proxmox agent

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.040
Which which is I mean to run the base the base, you know virtual machine

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.800
And then the proxmox agent on top of that took up 1.2 gigabytes of ram

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.000
So I had about three gigabytes of ram left to do anything with really anyway

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.360
I haven't done a comparison with uh a bunch of server

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.120
I went ahead and put the full version of service to the minified version

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.840
On my nodes at this point and I went ahead and reinstalled and put that on 19 different things

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.840
So I'm going to be running a bunch of server on everything

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.640
um, and then I'm going to be running kvm and live vert and vert manager from

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.760
Uh, my main server directly and then also the vnc and stuff like that from it

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.720
I don't really need anything to do that management

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.960
I'm looking at like ansible to kind of help with that but after looking at it

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.080
How problematic ansible is with the whole python thing? I'm actually thinking about making my own

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.480
single binary agent

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.800
That's compiled with bonsai that runs on the endpoints

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.080
That does essentially what I did when I was at IBM and I wrote

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.040
I wrote an entire infrastructure framework

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.720
for audit compliance and security for 52 000 machines

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.200
I'm thinking about doing the same sort of thing and go just as a fun project. It's a home lab

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.760
That's what they're for and I absolutely hate all the solutions that are out there right now

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.760
Because they require python virtual environments and they they over step in what they do to the

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:17.440
Virtual machines and and if you still are running on on iron and you don't want to run under vm because you're going to take a

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.480
30% loss through your containers. That's another stat. I found

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.040
I switched to kvm vert box from virtual virtual box. Did you really cool?

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:31.840
And I I mean, I really think kvm is the way to go. I kvm is the basis for all major cloud providers now

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.800
Uh, and it's it's going to be the future

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.720
And so anything that I can do that plays in the kvm space

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.560
Uh, it's going to be more relevant long term and it's also fun

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.760
So I am going to be writing. I'm looking at salt right now, but that's also python and I was like, eh

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:54.720
So I may be stealing some of the best ideas of these configuration management systems and creating one and go if one doesn't already exist

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.240
and doing that I might actually resurrect fluff, which is um

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.600
Was what I started some time ago to do this very thing to provision

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.160
You know vm's really quickly and based on profiles and things like that

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.880
But to do it on a local machine using, you know, your local installation of vmware

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.120
Uh, I started out with virtual box

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.400
We had three providers and they would do it locally if you had enough, you know prox

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.680
But I think we could come back to the to the fluff thing and maybe come up with some sort of distributed thing as well

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:28.800
And now we're like controlling things remotely as well. So, uh, if we do that, that'll be a bonsai branch

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.160
It'll be fluff as a bonsai branch and then we'll be able to put that in your monolith

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.880
And your bonsai is your monolith or whatever you want to do

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.560
So that's that's all development that I plan to do over, you know

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.080
When this whether gets colder and stuff and after I get my lab set up

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.520
So if you want to watch any of that happening, it's going to be going for a while. Yes, it is a not invented here thing

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:54.640
I'm making a mountain what I really don't understand is why there's not a better product in this space. That's a single binary

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.200
Uh, the closest thing to it is terraform

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:04.160
Which is just orchestration. I mean you can bend it's arm and make it do configuration management, but it's not designed for that

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:11.600
Um, and there's no combination of configuration orchestration and and stuff like fabric which just runs remote

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.120
Uh, you know, just run this one thing remote and give you back the results

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.160
And I I I don't know why, um

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.400
And I I feel like there's some area for innovation on that front

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.880
Uh, what's the font? This is group. This is uh, ubuntu mono

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.720
Yeah, it just looks good because I I adopted the group box

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.000
So and and I run it at a pretty high

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.440
Uh size so that you can read it from wherever

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.960
Uh, what is your font about that? We under that. Um

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.480
So the question should you should you try to run Linux on max of apples actually trying to keep it from happening?

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.880
Uh

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.880
The answer to this is

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200
Yes in your home lab

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.800
So

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:02.560
There's kind of two contexts for when you make a decision about what you want to run Linux on if you're

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.200
picking hardware for

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
any size organization

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.480
Obviously, you're not going to buy max for that

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.880
but

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:19.520
If you are working for a school or somebody that has a bunch of old lab hardware

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.320
Mac minis like mine or other old hardware and you don't have the budget to

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.880
You know use the cloud or even have a good internet connection for god's sakes

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.960
There are max errors. Yeah, but yeah, um, we were talking so

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.760
Uh, yeah, they're 10 and they were on aix. Do you remember the 90s?

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.760
In the 90s. Yeah, the power PCs. They're on aix. This is IBM tech

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.880
So anyway, um

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.640
Yeah, I can tell that people are not as interested. I have to say anymore that the viewers are dropping a little bit

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.960
Uh, that's fine. I don't care. So you should try to run Linux on max. I I do think

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.280
That if you

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.080
Have an old mac and you want to breathe life into it again

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.920
Because especially if it's been written off by apple who said we're not supporting that anymore

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.680
Goodbye

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.600
And and it has intel hardware, which is a lot of old intel and I said, yeah, hell, yeah

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.720
Uh osx server. Yeah, the cheese grader mac pro

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.560
And it has osx. Yes

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.800
Uh, it's yeah, it does. Well, yeah, I mean they're

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.280
Yes, the answer is yes. I I think you should run Linux on anything and everything

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.080
And I have made a great hobby and passion of mine to do that. There was a time when I couldn't drop

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.760
Five grand on a server and make, you know, the sweet corporate money now

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.800
But there was a time when I was we're starting out and there's a lot of you out there watching right now who don't have that kind of

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.840
money

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.840
and you are

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.680
You know at best in a in a dorm or you're trying to get it to run and you're trying to dual boot your mid laptops and stuff, right

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.560
and to someone like that just having a server

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.160
Of any kind having a separate computer to run Linux on is and use it as a server and leave it plugged into the wall

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.640
it's a big deal

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.760
and

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:21.600
For many people they will find old hard. I had one guy who was the son of the director of tech for david's college

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.200
And he had like thousands of dollars and left over hardware. It made me so sick

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.760
but he just got so

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.640
you know

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.160
Linux

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.160
Linux is

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.880
I mean one part of the core ethos of Linux is

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.040
Breathing new life into old hardware no matter what

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.600
And you'd be surprised what people can put Linux on it's amazing

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.560
Uh

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:53.360
To be mean to viewers. Yeah, I can't be pretty mean so anyway, um

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.760
So what I'm trying to say is that um

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.400
Is that

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.640
You should you should try to run on anything and don't let people put you down

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.880
If you're running it on like a p2

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.080
Or you know some really ancient hardware because you know what you'd be surprised. This is another thing about Linux

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.160
I never get tired

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:15.920
of

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.880
Dealing particularly when I was mentoring people directly one-on-one in person

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.920
I don't get this

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.240
I don't get this buzz as much as I used to because I don't deal with people and it's really annoying actually

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.280
One of my I didn't get paid much when I ran my own company because I lower the rate really low

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.280
So I can do the bare minimum

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.800
And so one of the things that was valuable to me was being in person with somebody when they're learning this stuff

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.960
All of the aha moments. Oh

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.960
Oh

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.760
I used to be present when they would have these moments and they were worth like a hundred dollars each to me

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.800
They still are

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.080
I miss it

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.320
This is why I want to I want y'all to stream so I can get you know paid

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.040
through watching you discover stuff

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.320
because because

01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.680
Seriously, so

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.160
One of those times there there is nothing better that okay

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.840
So one guy actually brought in is another story one guy brought in I told him I said look if you look it goes

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.400
I don't have a computer. I don't know where to go. I said I promise you

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.000
Next time you're at a family gathering if you ask your family members

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.400
If anybody has an old computer in the closet or the attic someplace that they're keeping because it's got old tax records on it

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.520
Right, it's got old tax records on it and they're too afraid to give it to goodwill

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.480
And I guarantee you there are tons of them if you go find those things and they say well, we don't want to give

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.000
It's got tax records. Okay. Well or browser histories or something like that, right?

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.560
You could you can go find it you will find one

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.640
I promise you and you promise them that you will wipe that disc clean and that you will make it better

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.640
and that you will put it to good use

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.320
And I you would not believe how many free computers people can find

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.120
In fact, it was such a thing. It was such a thing that we would actually start

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840
going through

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.480
Neighborhoods we started putting together an affidavit that we could get legally signed and presented people so we could say

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.040
Look, we are officially this is our official position on this. We're not begging

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.640
We are taking your old computers cleaning them up and and

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.200
Renewing them and giving them to people who don't have computers so that we can close the digital divide in our own country

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:20.400
That is my primary goal with linux and if it if and if a company like red hat says we don't care what our

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.040
Distro runs on do you see how offensive that gets to me because that's like red hat saying

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.400
We really don't want to be a part of that

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:35.120
We just want to cater to the enterprise. We don't care about all the linux efforts that are going on all over the world

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:42.560
Uh to put computers and technology in the hands of people who don't have it to take old hardware and breathe new life in it

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.400
Because the most pleasurable aha moment that you will ever hear

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.520
Is somebody booting an old computer into windows 98 and I kid you not

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.160
Looking it around at all the old netscape navigator stuff on everything

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:02.240
And installing linux and watching it just cook as a server watching it run

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.960
Fine as a server watching it be a hundred percent performant as a server because it's way more powerful than any the even a raspberry pi 4

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.160
Even though it's like 10 year old computer

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.400
So instead of going to the trash heap or to someplace else

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.960
This computer becomes

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.880
A new toy and it's now in the corner of the garage or it's plugged in it's like really a slow ethernet

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.840
You know

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:32.560
And there's that so to me that's when you when you ask whether you should run an apple

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.280
I think you should run on anything and I think the first time that you show somebody

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.240
I mean look if you take away all that ugly gooey

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.360
Right you're using a 10 year old computer right now exactly you take away all that ugly gooey stuff and you learn to use the terminal

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:53.040
You would be blown away and you can run like the fish at max settings

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.240
You know

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.560
And if you're using vi you're not going to get any lag at all because it's vi vi's rate is supposed to work on 300 bond

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.080
So, you know all of these things

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.120
make using

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.080
You know computers really fun again

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.920
In fact, if there's one reason to try linux is it makes computing fun again

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.520
Using linux makes computers fun to the right person

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.440
Not everybody wants to use the terminal and see what they can do with all these important

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.240
These kind of people by the way are the kind of people that will like

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:36.560
You know like get a pair of wire cutters and strip down old serial cables and like cause them to control other electronics and shit like that

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.920
And maybe they never did it before but they just want to experiment with that

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.360
That's the kind of person that gets really into this kind of stuff

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.880
Uh working with linux and open stack all day. Oh, you'll have to talk to us about open stack. I actually want to

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.600
Uh open stack is all python unfortunately

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.800
Uh, but I am thinking about learning open stack

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.280
Uh, because I think open stack would be better than something like proxmox for even a home lab

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.760
Uh, and by the way open stack, there's lots and lots of work in open stack

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.040
Yeah, if you learn open stack, that's something that's an open source very very open source technology that is

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.520
Um, but apparently they they're really really really bigoted about python

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:22.480
Yeah, tony far reported that that he tried to commit some uh, some add some projects and go to the projects

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.480
And they were denied because they weren't go

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.000
And when I heard that I was like, oh, I don't know man

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:34.240
I mean they're that into python, you know, they don't want to even consider other languages

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.000
So I they're we're kind of on the cusp of a lot of other stuff

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.640
Hey, how's it going south korea?

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.080
Love having you. I love south korea. I cannot wait to go one day

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.720
I want to go to south korea so bad it hurts

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.360
Uh, pythonic is in nature. Yes, that's right. Yeah

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.400
so

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.400
Who bought all the pies?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.760
Uh, I have a few what did I change my title? Please tell me I did

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.640
Okay, good. I guess I guess I didn't

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.400
I thought I did I did that same thing I did before again

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.800
Uh, I thought I changed the title. I didn't all right. Well, let's let's wrap up the stream here

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.400
Singapore

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.600
fantastic

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.040
Oh, I love rancher desktop rancher, but it's got a problem

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.600
um

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.600
What is the data lake? I have no idea. What is a data lake?

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560
I am a nerd we talked about that already

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.800
Yeah

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.760
You go back and watch the watch the youtube video when I post it if you wanted a data lake is a centralized repository

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.000
That allows you to store all your structure on structure data at scale

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.960
You can store your data as is having to first structure the data

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.600
Yeah

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:51.280
I'm not a I'm not a fan of data lakes. Uh, you got it fair. I've been a relational database person my whole life

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.520
Uh, if you look at like mongo db and a bunch of people that have tried to do object databases

01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.320
And you you see them fall on their face and end up, uh, deploying a relational database later

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.360
Uh, you'll see the problem. I think you should start with relational relational database up front

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:10.880
Uh, if you need a database if you don't need a database, you might be fine with just files actually

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.520
Uh, I know that's heresy to say it, but um

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.200
Yeah, I but I'm not I'm not a fan of that

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.920
Uh, so yeah

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.160
Corporate yes

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:28.560
What do I think of web 3? I hate it. Uh, web 3 is disastrously poorly designed. Uh, it's horribly over engineered

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.280
By extremely intelligent people who have no practical sense whatsoever

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:39.840
And these are my worst type of technologists if I detect that type of technologist

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.440
In real life, whether I'm working with them or I see them at a conference or at a pub

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.640
I will do everything in my power to get out of the room and go somewhere far away from them

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.880
Because yeah, SQLite exactly so

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.440
um

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.280
People who don't understand why web 3 is a bad idea

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:07.520
Uh, are not thinking in practical terms. I I absolutely despise

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.640
Engineers who are not practical

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:17.600
Who do things because they can who like to pick technology because it's cool and because it's complex

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.960
I despise technology for technology's sake

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.960
um

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.800
Yeah, I'll go swing in a hammock. I will this I

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.600
Technology is serves one purpose of one purpose only and that is to enable life to

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.520
be better

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.520
and to go on and to

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:44.720
You know and create harmony in the universe and and all of those things and any technology that just tracks from that

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.760
Uh, especially if it's claiming to do that and it fails to hypocritically

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.640
Uh, I don't want nothing to do with it and that's web 3

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.320
As web 3 that's NFTs. That's any of the crypto stuff

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:03.600
Uh, am I opposed to people exploring the realm and see if it's a good way to secure exchanges between banks and stuff?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
possibly, uh

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.080
I I'm just I'm just tired of

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.400
of

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:18.240
Impractical people applying their extremely intelligent brains to things and coming up with shit that makes no sense at all

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.760
Uh, and by the way html was a bad idea myself, too

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:26.080
I think html was a bad idea and to a lesser degree html was exactly this problem

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.360
Markdown was plenty fine

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.400
Why didn't they use it markdown was invented by writers

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.920
Who wanted something practical html was invented by scientists

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.360
So they immediately went to the other scientists and they said hey scientists

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.440
Uh, what are you already using for like managing like data and stuff?

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:55.120
We're using this sgml thing with some big ass acronym that doesn't make any sense to anybody and make some sound really important

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.360
No markdown did not exist if it had in fact the knowledge exchange grid that I want to make

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.120
Is markdown and Hugo's markdown, right?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Yeah, Hugo's Hugo's a go tech

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:09.280
so

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.560
Markdown is relatively, you know, uh, by the way erin schwarz

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:18.720
Uh, and uh, John Gruber made markdown John Gruber still has

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.280
Uh, I think John Gruber has been he's so much of a writer and a podcaster

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.120
They asked him a jgm who made pandog invited him

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.040
to be in a you know involved and he's like nah

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.320
And so jgms lost was like trying to document mark out good

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.080
If you go read the itf rfc's on markdown, it's hilarious because there's no official markdown

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.240
Specification at all and so they tried to come up with one and jgm was left

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.840
This berkeley guy was left to come up with you know as close as he could come up with with a standard because markdown as

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:56.640
Defined in the pearl script that jong made that erin helped him make by the way erin schwarz

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.200
God knows he's one of my favorite humans who ever live

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:00.960
um

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.000
You know they they it's got tons of bugs and

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:09.360
Inconsistency is a specification of jgm and very scientifically. He's like he's a philosophy professor berkeley

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.680
He's like okay. We got to fix this so he gets in there

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.720
And he tries to fix it all and he comes up with as much consensus as he can for common mark

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.480
And he got github to sit at the table and reddit and a couple other people

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:26.000
And they come out with the common mark standard which you know and get a flavor markdown as an extension of it now

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.080
And so that's all been standardized

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.240
But

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.600
You know so look there does need to be a scientific approach to it

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.920
But I I tell you that story because it's a perfect example of engineers screwing shit up

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.920
They do it all the time

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.200
engineers

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.960
fix problems

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.400
But they also create problems out of thin air

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.600
Because they're engineers

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:57.120
And I know because I've done it i've done it i've done it so many times

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.800
Raise your hand if you've done it raise your hand if you've over engineered a solution

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:05.280
And and you're like you come you go get some coffee you come back and you're like and you look at it you're like

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:11.600
You mean I could oh my god or or here's a here's a better one. Here's a better one your wife, right?

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:16.960
You're like you're like you're like going for a walk and you don't have a twitch stream to torment with all of your ideas, right?

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.360
Yeah, and you're like and you're and you're talking to your you know you're talking

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.400
You're like tormenting your wife with like technical knowledge, right?

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.120
It's just trying really hard because she loves you to understand what you're saying

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.360
And she's trying to follow you because she loves you and you try to follow her art stuff and everything

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.480
And and out of nowhere. She says well, what if you did this?

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.120
I mean, I mean she's like, you know, I'm not a techie or anything

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.200
But what if I just what if you just did that instead and you're like, oh my god

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.080
You're a genius

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.880
Oh

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.880
Yeah, you know it's like

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.320
So uh-oh you're gonna come in and comment on that

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.280
I'm I'm just wrapping up. I was just telling him how you have to have somebody who asked why are you doing it that way?

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400
Ooh beef uncured hot dogs

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.920
Mark wallberg is making hot dogs now. He has a whole restaurant thing going on. Okay

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.800
Can you turn the last thing?

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.800
Well, actually I need to talk about tech

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.480
How many things is that break? Why does this why couldn't this just be simple?

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:19.840
Why did I have to make my documentation website use javascript?

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.280
IBM I post that on twitter today

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.240
Seriously, all of all of IBM's documentation site requires javascript to read it. Ask yourself

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.280
How come that's a bad idea?

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.040
So

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.000
So

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.880
Web three to me and I did answer the question. What do you think of web three?

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.520
I think web three is the epitome

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.240
It's like if you took all the people if you took

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.880
Like like the whole rick and morty idea where you can separate the toxic cells from the good self, you know

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.120
If you were to take all of the toxic

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:58.320
Overengineers self from every engineer and you were to put that in a big vat of actual, you know goo in rick and morty style

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.920
And you were like have it like take on some sort of like nebulous form that could communicate

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.160
It would create web three

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:12.480
Because that's what it is web three is the absolute worst possible

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.240
design from the most over engineered

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.120
impractical

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.320
Frankly idiotic perspective you could ever imagine and and I that's all I have to say about that

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.520
It makes me really happy that

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:30.640
At least I have my feet on the ground and that sometimes I'm actually happy that I'm dumb

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:34.720
Compared to some of these other engineers because it causes me to think things through more

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.760
I I can't you know spit out, you know

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:45.200
Uh complexity theory algorithms or do land to calculus, you know at lunch. I'm not that guy. I can't do that. So

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.720
I'm glad sometimes because it keeps my feet on the ground and it makes me think through things

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.080
Um and and think and ask questions like why are all these dashes in all of our command lines?

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.960
Get off get off this as a good example of over engineered crap

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.840
You know when somebody created a a user interface that was an engineer is like we'll put one dash here for this

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.160
We'll put two dashes here. We'll allow colon for this

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.280
And that's why I made bonsai because I am a practical person

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.720
I don't like when people over engineer stuff and one of the most over-engineered things ever is get-up. So

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.200
That's a little rant about that. Um

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.960
No experience with snort and nips or nids. I wish I did. I'm super sorry. I can't talk about that

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.040
Uh

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:34.080
This is just the whole idea of looking at logs all the time and studying those and combining them all

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.840
That's been around since the days of like, um centralized, um

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:46.320
Uh system log, uh daemons, but it's still a thing. I still think it should be done. Um, what is nips

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.280
I don't know what nips is

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.280
network intrusion detection system

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.880
Umbrella term for combination of hardware and software. That's cool. I like the concept from what I understand of it

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.080
Um

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.680
Is the system that attempts to detect hacking activities to now have service attacks

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.080
I think these things are cool. I really do. Uh, I don't have anything

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:13.680
I don't my is just old school tripwire. We would just like check some every file on the whole system make

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.320
lists of of um

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.560
Exceptions and then watch for things to change

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.720
Uh security is actually a lot simpler than most people make it out to be

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.960
Kind of in that practical sense

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.800
all you really have to do to ensure a system is secure is track everything on the system and tell you when anything changes

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.040
You don't have to have fancy signatures

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:37.120
It can be gotten around by compiling the same malware and go that was in c before

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.200
You don't have if you just look for things on the system that are regularly changed

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.440
And and create ways to detect those changes in the system

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.560
Uh and report on them that that is the number blue one blue team approach that I think everybody should be doing

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.200
And I don't know that's how I caught the hacker who invaded my computer at home back when I set up my own mail server

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.760
Um, and that's how everybody

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.880
It should be doing it. I don't understand why it's so so hard

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.520
Uh the defender defeater

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.120
Yeah

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:11.600
What is eldep and I should use it so eldep is a lightweight directory access protocol. This is uh something came from the 90s that was used to

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.720
Uh put group information for corporations and stuff and it is still used a lot. Um, it's used in

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:23.680
We've talked about it before we talked about it with uh, I want to say hayden

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:30.160
And uh with free IPA and some things like that. It's built into active directory now as of may as of may 2022

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.120
Um, and it's the way that you get group permissions

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.400
Once a person authenticates to see if they can do things if you can authorize them to do different things

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:42.480
Uh, I think everybody should use it. It should be a part of your system

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:49.520
Uh in your identity management and how you do things. Uh, we will be putting open eldep on my lab here

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.680
Um, probably in the form of free IPA. Although I'm

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.560
I'm a little bit leery of free IPA now now that I've been looking back at nis, which is really old tech

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.640
Uh, but I want to see if there's something related to that before I make a decision right now

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:09.040
I'm just doing localized logins on everything and which is more zero trustee because it does use search for all that

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:14.480
Uh eldep is not a windows thing. No eldep is getting if you do a search for eldep

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.120
You're going to get a lot of hits for azure and active directory these days because that's usually where people are run

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.560
Or they're deploying it. Uh, but it's actually way older than that

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:27.680
Yeah on linux, it comes. Yeah, linux eldep has kerberos built into it

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.880
Kerberos is the name of the three headed dog

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.920
Greek dog that was guarding whatever and

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:41.760
Is mit technology designed to do password authentication without ever sending passwords over the over the wire

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.320
By exchanging data that's been signed using public key cryptography

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.800
So kerberos is the standard. Uh, even if you're not using it outright

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:58.160
You're using it inside of other things. It's kerberos is is built into pam for example and linux se and

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.360
And eldep and everything else. It's just not always front in the center

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.360
Uh, yeah the tickets that nobody really understands exactly

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:12.640
Uh, if you're familiar with wire shark, you can be familiar. Yep. It's another one. Yeah, and you can watch eldep over the wire too. Um

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:18.240
These days eldep is secured and you know over encrypted connections, but not always

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.760
Um, but most of the time these days eldep is used to give information about an account

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.840
Uh regarding, you know, what things this authorized to do and what it can do

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:32.400
Uh roles will say role-based authentication. I mean authorization

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.200
Um, but it and it can be used for authentication the first part that says i am me

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.520
Uh, but that i am me thing, uh, is now

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:48.480
Taking place elsewhere in kerberos and other things that are um

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.200
And then eldep is provides the other data

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.760
They get that right

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:59.200
Uh, it's still useful and not over engineered. I think public key cryptography is not at over engineered at all

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:02.000
I think I think it's actually the only natural way to do it

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:04.240
Um

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.680
Uh, it's the other things you call smart are harmful. No, absolutely not

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:12.160
No, and there are some things that have to be complex cryptography is one of those things

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.520
Um, and I you know and I accept that right? Uh, I I don't think cryptography can be

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:22.320
Although I mean you can make the argument that some of the cryptographic algorithms failed because of over engineering

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:24.480
If you I I'm not going to get into it

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:32.240
But if you like short like the failure of blowfish or rsa or any of the other ones that are no longer officially good, you know

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:39.520
Uh, you might you know uncover the fact that somebody was getting really clever and their cleverness ended up being their downfall

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.160
um

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.120
But you know, we do need cleverness. Don't get me wrong. So I yeah

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:50.720
Uh, does does how to I mean my favorite xkcd about this is

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:57.040
Uh, you guys know the xkcd about the password thing. It's a perfect example of this over engineering concept

01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.760
That seems to be the theme today. Um, does anybody have a link to it? I'll go find it xkcd

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:06.160
Uh password. It's it's one of the most popular pass rots

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:12.800
Here it here it is, right? Wait. Oh troubadour common substitutions. You're risk

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.160
No, that's not it. Where is it?

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.720
That's not it

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.360
Any enigma

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:24.240
Too coffee just enough to use it effectively. Yes, it was

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.880
um

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.880
Dang it

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.120
Where's the one you guys know what I'm talking about?

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.640
password

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.960
Uh pass rod actually pass for encryption

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.760
If you know what it's the next kcd about the encryption thing

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.480
I'm trying to find it. I can't it's taking me forever because I'm slow

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:55.440
Or is it you just have to look for a club

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.360
Yes

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.480
Or is it I love it. I love it. I can't find it

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:08.240
I'm gonna I'm gonna spend all day trying to find it if I can't find it. You guys can try to help me find it

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.320
It's the one where he talks about his algorithm

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:21.680
Uh for defeating defeat cryptography how to defeat

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.800
Uh password cryptography

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.520
Ah

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.120
It's actually it's actually a joke about it and and and mr. Robot

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
Oh, here it is. Yeah, this is the one

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:42.720
Okay, so

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.720
Here we go

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720
A crypto a crypto nerd's imagination

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:54.400
His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a multi-million dollar cluster to crack it. No good. It's 40 96 bit rsa encrypted

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.800
Blast our evil plan is foiled

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:03.680
What would actually happen his laptop's encrypted drug him and hit him with the five dollar wrench until he tells us the password

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Got it

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:13.760
This this is my favorite because this is exactly how

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.400
This is engineers over here, right? And this is like practical dumb people

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.280
Threat models are a thing they are a thing

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.240
you know and

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:33.920
You know, it's like you spend like multi-billion dollars on the door and the wall next to it is two by fours and drywall

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.920
You know

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.760
It's like

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:45.040
But then they don't think about it. This is this is a pretty common meme out there. By the way, they're not dumb, right?

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.320
Uh, they're not so you see engineers

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.880
Yeah, I mean

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.480
you know, it's

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.480
And I think that this problem comes about because people overthink

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:58.960
Uh

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.760
The technology either because it's exciting to them because they really get off on mathematics or something or

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.960
Some other reason I don't know why but they they don't accidentally lock

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:13.040
ZQ says accidentally locked my keys inside a calm closet today

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.960
Then I realized the door was on backwards. So I just took a piece of metal in there and

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:21.280
I'm probably a vulnerability

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to tell you

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.920
Yeah, you know, it's fun. It's it's fun to talk about. It's horrible when I when you experience it

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.240
So as I seems to be kind of the theme today, I hope I hope no one gets overly

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.480
Been out of shape on my picking on engineers

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.720
I am one and I am the first one to tell you that I've made tons and tons of mistakes

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.880
Uh, because I overthought something and some of these projects I threw away

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:50.400
Do you guys remember that parser that I made where I made my own sco sub language to do all the parsing?

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.800
And I was like, why don't I just like go? I mean, I totally threw the whole thing away

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.280
I threw like three weeks of work

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.080
and an entire

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.040
documented

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:05.200
Subline sub go api for this language that I had created and I chucked it all

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.560
And I I replaced it with like a one rune

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.440
Uh character scanner instead

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:16.880
And and then code did code generation when necessary and I was like, oh my god. What was I thinking?

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.640
And you know, we're going to go through those times. That's just human progress

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.920
But you know and I really shouldn't beat people up for over engineering things until they get like all

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.920
You know white towery, you know, ivory tower about it. It's like you're going to use what we give you and you're going to like it

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.920
And people get like that. I have lose my patience

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.280
uh

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.200
A lot of over engineering actually comes from corporate and management not from mentors themselves. I agree

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.960
Uh, let me give you an example of that one fun one fun. Uh

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.280
Uh, the crypto web three job you experienced it first hand really

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.560
So let me give you an example of that the engineer the management screwing stuff up. Okay

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.160
This is a true story from my buddy brent who worked in the military

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.960
I taught him linux, uh, you know back in the day

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.920
He had taught me salaris and he was kind of my mentor. I was the first official system of a job I had

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.880
I had been doing web development. I was like his webmaster before that

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.120
This was my first actual job, you know managing salaris and aix and everything

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:16.720
and

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:23.120
He told me a story once that we used to play chess and and and eat and talk stories because it's just a big job

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.040
Uh

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:28.800
At lunch and he told me the story once about how it's and I've told the story before his senior officer

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.760
Uh, he he did all the work to spec out a salaris, uh server

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:40.240
And he got the best one possible for the job and it cost like 20 50 000. It was like really spending

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.040
Um, but it was small

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:47.600
And if you know anything about technology, you know that if you want small you pay more money

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.280
Right

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.160
And so, I mean it was barely the size of like a for you tower today, right?

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.200
But uh, we do have questions but not right now

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.120
We're about out of time

01:39:59.120 --> 01:39:59.840
We are out of time

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.400
But if you want to you can give me a question we can put in for tomorrow

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.680
Or you can come on in and leave the questions in our discord in the questions conversations and advice channel

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:13.360
Economy of scale, right? So so, I mean everybody in the it world knows that

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.600
Smallest better

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.600
You know if you can keep the heat down everything

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:24.240
So no joke his senior officer said I have my commanding officer is coming in i'm giving him a tour

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.480
And that will not do they're going to be here in two weeks. You need to do something about this news

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.480
Like what do you want me to do?

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.120
And he's like, I don't know it just needs to be bigger

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.480
Very male american military thing to say

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.200
And he said, uh

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.080
Well, we could get a rack for it and we could get it like a we could get like a

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.760
We could get like a rack for it like a like a 42 u rack for it and put it in that

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.560
He goes is that bigger and he's like, well, yeah

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.680
I mean that would be like, you know 13 feet in the air and you just put the in there and we just close the door on it

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
And he's like I want that

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.560
I

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.720
Want that

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.080
His senior officer no kidding his senior officer

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:15.840
Commanded him to spend an extra 300 dollars like a delrack or whatever to put his like

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.480
four five u server in that cost like 20 50 thousand dollars

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.520
And you know, he's like, okay

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:30.240
I'm sure it was and you know, we were just riffing and he was like, oh, you know, I can put some lights on it

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.040
I

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:36.640
Yeah, it's the kind of outlets suspension on step 150. I know

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:43.200
You know when he got victorious like see this is our new computer, which we just which we just purchased, you know

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:48.000
And brent's been here brent's been instrumental in getting the server for us in front of brent

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.160
I just love brent brent. I I wish I could get brent on the stream

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.040
brent is the most

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.200
Stoic human being I have ever known

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.320
He's hilarious. He's so hilarious. He never cracks jokes. He's just really smart

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.280
I I can see his mustached face today. He's the kind of guy

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Who just doesn't talk

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.520
But when he does say stuff, it's really funny. It's really interesting and I just I will never forget that story

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.920
I miss him so much. He was such a great

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.000
I mean, I know, you know, it's hard to you know, you you get people that you work with that are great friends

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.680
And I I just really I really miss having having him around and and letting me like transom and and

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:31.680
Vera, how are you? Wow? Speaking of having fun friends around

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:36.880
Good to see you my friend. Please don't dox anything about yourself in the moment. This is going on youtube

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.960
We are just about ready to wrap up

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:41.680
Uh, my my good friend Vera is here. Uh

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.960
So we will we'll be catching up in a bit

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So stop by the youtube channel

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.720
Uh, stop by the twitch channel if you want to watch me making a lab

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:56.800
I can't wait to hear all the things i'm doing wrong from Vera my friend, uh about my server

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.080
I'm sure that everyone's going to have an opinion on that. I've gotten used to it though

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.040
So

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.880
It'll be fun

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:06.880
Talk to you later youtube

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.040
Stop
