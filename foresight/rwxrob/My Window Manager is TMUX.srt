1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
One of the things I get asked all the time is what my window manager is I get that I don't know what this is about people

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,320
Obsessed about window managers and distros and stuff. It's fine. People are just making conversation

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Rarely they're judging you based on your choices

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,240
to me it doesn't matter as my window manager is Tmux and

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,840
Do I use a status bar? I use my Tmux status bar

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,640
So as you can see right now everything that you see on the screen is Tmux. This is a full-screen

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:35,240
Nome terminal that came with pop OS is my distro and I have got a Tmux within a Tmux

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
So this stuff down here is all we chat

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,920
This down here is my status bar. This is a status update my pulmonary trauma on my Tmux configuration

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,360
Which we're going to be covering in other videos. So stay tuned

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
And then here's my title down here

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,400
You can't see it, but and then up here you can see this is this is up here. This is a Vim session

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,520
And up here you can see that I have another Tmux status bar

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,120
That's because I have a Tmux within a Tmux and stay tuned. I'll show you how to do that safely

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,840
So that you can actually have two status bars or you can split your screen and do all kinds of crazy amazing things with this

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
so by using

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
By what's that can use it to previous CPU usage and other things absolutely

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,840
I can do all of that from the command line if I wanted if I wanted to put CPU utilization or anything

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,320
I wanted to I could put it in my terminal in my in my in my

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,840
You know status bars of different types so I could put it up here or I could make a pain

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,800
I can do this so I can split a pain over here. So easily. I just split that pain in half

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,720
That's pain management. And then if I want a new window control C

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Let me turn my eskies on so you can see everything

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,840
But as you can see I can go back and forth screen and tell it multiplexers I can split this guy some more

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,280
I can make T matrix here run

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,200
You know, I can put the fish in another terminal the point being that I have absolute immediate control

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,120
Over all of my windows and pains people continually say you need to learn I3 you're learning blah blah blah

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,280
I say no, I don't need any of that all I need is Tmux because Tmux gets you everything you need I

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,200
Do everything from the terminal anyway, so there's no need for me to do anything besides that

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,720
It does manage my windows it matters my real estate it manages my pains

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,360
It allows me to do I mean I can do H top over here if I want to have that thing sometimes in another window

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,920
I'll roll I'll run my other thing and and by the way all the bindings that I have here are also

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,120
Completely transferable, right? So it's like

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
configuration centralized and

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,880
Portable

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,240
In a single file, so you know your Tmux config if I'm doing like I don't know

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm good planning on doing the Kubernetes certification and I know that they have Tmux so that odds are I can take my

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,880
Tmux com files stick it on the system along with my batch RC and my Vim are seeing I'm good to go

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,640
I don't care do it. Could I install I3 on there? No, could I you know change my Linux distro?

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
No, let's say that I want to just run a Docker container

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,520
So, you know, let's say I'm going to run it's like the fault Docker container Docker run it

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,680
You know, let's like run it a bunch of container, right dash dash RM and

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Let's give it a name. Let's do Debian and what we should we call it?

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,320
What is it? How do you do names in I think it is something I don't remember so

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Oh, fairly crazy because that shouldn't actually not found. Oh wait

46
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,800
I think it's dash and something so Debian

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,720
Is it dash T dash T is the name. I thought it was dash and is it dash T

48
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,320
What is it people I think it's dash dash and

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,280
Name I know there's a shortcut. Okay. So here we are on here, right?

50
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,440
So so now I can like I have my I have my host here and

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,120
It didn't seem to work. So we'll just go ahead and use this

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,240
So let's say I want to put my team looks config over here. I want to put my my team looks good thing. So Docker copy

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
This

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,480
Tmux comf and I want to put it on this. Yeah

55
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,520
I also structure. What am I talking about Docker copy?

56
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,640
Oh wait, where is my team looks file? Did I put it someplace else? Oh

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
there is

58
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,640
Tmux comf to am I doing it wrong? What am I doing wrong? I

59
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Think I have to put slash there. Yeah, there we go. So now it's here

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,320
So over here. I don't have Tmux. So you have to update

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Damn it have to update

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
a

63
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
app install

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Tmux

65
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, I want to install Tmux. Let's see how fast this goes. I start Tmux over here and

66
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,760
It didn't pull up my my thing yet. So let's see if it's still there

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,840
Is it there? Yep, there it is. So where's my home directory root? Okay, here we go

68
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,840
move slash Tmux comf to dot and now Tmux. Oopsy

69
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Get out of that Tmux

70
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,840
It should pick it up. It doesn't look like it is. I

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Just not picking it up. Let me see if I can do it Tmux. Was it dash C? I

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,160
Got it. I don't remember what it is. I didn't plan this

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
So

74
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
We talking about oh, there's no man page

75
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,960
All right, so Tmux is it dash C

76
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,320
Dot Tmux com the point is you can use Tmux on it if I can't get it you can you get what I'm saying

77
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
This is file directory

78
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,520
We talking about oh, there we go

79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,080
Set that show yeah, I know you didn't think you were gonna get to see me docker fail this whole time, did you?

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,520
No, since file directory what the oh wait?

81
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,920
Sashay, I don't know. I see it right there. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. I

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,120
Wanted to reload my Tmux and it's not loading it. Come on load my Tmux. Please load it

83
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,800
Uh

84
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,960
Okay, well it's loading something. It's loading something. I don't think that's the right thing

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,200
But it's loading something the point is you can take your configuration with you and and you can change it up and

86
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,400
And just copy between doctors containers and something that

87
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,320
I don't know here. Let's try this man Docker. Let's I don't I don't I don't have two minutes left

88
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,920
So let's try this man Tmux. Wait, we're gonna go into the Tmux conference after this. So

89
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,240
Man Tmux, let me go see if I can look up the comp

90
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,080
No dash C is a show command, of course silly me silly me

91
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,760
Where's the configuration file

92
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,160
By default Tmux was a configuration file from Etsy Tmux.com

93
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,160
It looks for a user configuration file at till the does that mean it because there's no user over here

94
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Is that way?

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Cuz cuz cuz it looks like there's one there. Okay, let's just add user

96
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,000
You you password you you

97
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes

98
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
you you

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
Yes

100
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
All right as you dash you

101
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,960
copy

102
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
root dot Tmux dot

103
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Comf to here

104
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
First denied

105
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,400
All right, well, let's try this schmocks schmod

106
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,840
Plus are

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,120
It doesn't have sudo built-in. I have to install sudo

108
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, so that's why I'm doing it. I know this is what you get when you get bear bound container

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,400
I actually have configure containers, but you get the point cannot operate on a dangling sim link. How are you a sim link?

110
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
You're not a sim link

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All right, fine

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
I'm gonna change this

113
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,280
Let's do this

114
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
Yep, let's just give me my copy. I'm gonna copy it to

115
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
slash

116
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,720
home slash you have it that and

117
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,440
Now we can do it exit Tmux

118
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,120
Damn it. Oh wait, let's do that you

119
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,560
Tmux

120
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,080
Still listen kidding it. I don't understand why make it make it go away. Wait did it?

121
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Am I using the right Tmux file even?

122
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,960
You guys like it when I screw up anyway, don't you? I mean, that's your favorite thing to watch no vi I

123
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,600
Could use Ed's not even here is that out here. I

124
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Think it is damn it

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Damn not even Ed I

126
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Didn't seem like it though. You saw that, right?

127
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,480
You did you see that? I did not seem like it. So apps

128
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
So then minimal

129
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I don't need the rest

130
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,440
Is it Vim's tiny is it Vim tiny?

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,680
Yeah, that's it okay, I could remember the sim link came from the host

132
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
You

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
LS-J oh

134
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,080
You guys

135
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,980
Finally cracked it for me. I feel so silly of course it did

136
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,360
It's like trying to link to things that don't exist. I'm 14 seconds over. Can I do it?

137
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,280
Pomo just shut up for a second. Okay? Okay, Pomo. Thank you. All right, so

138
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,600
CD into dot files. All right, let's do this. So cop be good to the Tmux the Tmux

139
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Uh

140
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,720
Doctor yeah, yeah, thank you. You guys cracked it. This is more fun that way when I screw up, right?

141
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,160
You can know the do the perils of using symbolic links. All right, so docker copy

142
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
dot Tmux dot com

143
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,480
To this thing whatever this is I

144
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,320
Didn't take my name because I got the command wrong because look I can't remember shit

145
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,340
That's just how I am. All right, so they went up

146
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:31,080
We do colon slash home slash you and I have a better feeling about this

147
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
I just do I just have a better feeling

148
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,080
LS-L

149
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,240
LS-LA. Oh god LS-L

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,480
Tmux

151
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,560
Huzzah, there's my Tmux that I know and love it's got my own things here

152
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:55,760
It's got all my bindings. It can turn my clock on. Where's the clock though? There's my refresh thingy. Anyway, as you can see

153
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,720
You get your Tmux and yes, I had problems because other reasons not because it was hard to get Tmux over there

154
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,480
So hopefully that's that's just helping that can make the case for you to consider

155
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Using a window manager. That's just Tmux

156
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,240
and

157
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,440
You know, you can you can you can put it on anything

158
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,820
And put it on anything. So I'll let's just review configuration centralized and portable single file. You can put it on anything

159
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Can be configured to behave

160
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,280
Like a screen which has come on every system since it's on a time

161
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,120
It's extremely powerful. I

162
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:47,560
Cannot even begin to tell you how powerful it is powerful and configurable even if you don't buy into the plug-in stuff, which I don't I

163
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,000
Avoid plug-ins because the plug-ins defeat the whole purpose of having a

164
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,520
Because no longer portable, right if you but you can use them right no longer portable

165
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,080
But I personally don't like them. I try to stick with the basics

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,400
And it's you know, it's universally available

167
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
So even

168
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
During certification exams

169
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,640
so, you know, if you're working through a web browser and

170
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,600
You can't see what you're working on and you haven't you having to fight with the web browser already because you're doing a certification test

171
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,400
It's a terminal-based thing and you're already using some sort of stupid ass web

172
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,520
Emulation, you know, if you got too much in there

173
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,880
It just makes it that much less painful because you can split the screen up and stuff like that rather than to do whatever

174
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,040
I can't even imagine what you would do which is a single terminal if you can't if you can't split the screen

175
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,920
You got to do two things at one time and you want to check

176
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,480
Maybe you want your documentation open in one window, which you can you can do or you want a man page

177
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,400
You're gonna be able to something like that, you know, then yeah, you need this

178
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,720
You're gonna open up multiple windows, you know web web terminal tabs in order to check out your different things

179
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,080
So there's just a million reasons to make Tmux the only window manager that you care about and

180
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,160
I cannot overemphasize that we're gonna still talk about how to configure Tmux thing and all that and I'll move on to different videos

181
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,760
About that, but this was supposed to be sort of a seamless demo of why you might want to use the team at the Tmux

182
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,800
Moon image or I have to do is watch me or anybody who uses one for a short amount of time to

183
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,800
really get a sense of why you might want to pick it up and

184
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,360
I mean you can use it to make your own sort of monitoring station if you're a kubernetes person

185
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,040
And we did I did this at work the other day where we had a bunch of things that we're watching at CD health checks

186
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,960
We had some pings running in other windows and it was all in this beautiful big split-screen console with no annoying borders in between

187
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,120
Other than like the one, you know terminal border in between the whole thing

188
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,800
so that's my that's my argument for using Tmux give it a shot and

189
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,800
We're gonna proceed with some other videos about configuration and stuff like that

190
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,480
We're gonna talk about oh persistent sessions, right? I forgot about that

191
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,080
So Tmux also allows you to have a persistent session

192
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,360
I'm gonna do a different video about persistent sessions though. So watch for that
