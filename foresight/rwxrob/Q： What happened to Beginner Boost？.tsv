0	2800	So where did SteelStock beginner boosts go?
2800	5600	That was the thing we were doing to get started.
5600	9840	The quick answer is it got moved.
9840	11840	And it was still gonna start something on May the 4th,
11840	16840	but so the overall focus is now gonna be on, you know,
22400	27200	content that, in fact, let me see
27200	29880	if I can go find my whiteboard here.
29880	31280	Here we go, Unix infrastructure engineer.
31280	33960	So it's gonna be called the Unix beginner boost
33960	36000	probably next year, but there's a good chance
36000	39000	I'm gonna change the name of all of those boosts
39000	40520	to match the name to the books that I'm writing
40520	41560	that I'm starting to write right now
41560	44440	and I'm obsessed with writing.
44440	46000	So the first book we're gonna write is
46000	48480	Mastering Terminal Velocity,
48480	51080	Mastering the Fastest Human-Commuter Interface,
51080	52840	which has everything from the beginner boosts
52840	55640	and you've probably seen me writing on it every day.
55640	59880	You can go look it up actually at github.com
59880	62640	slash, I mean, Rob, slash book.
62640	63840	And I've already covered this,
63840	66040	but you can go watch another video on this.
67080	72080	And we're gonna go back to this kind of thing.
76120	81120	And so that's what's happened to the boost, it's changed.
83400	85200	So most of the people that are interested in this
85200	86600	are interested in the Go coding
86600	88240	that they were learning at the boost.
88240	89760	We already decided a couple of weeks ago
89760	94200	that the Go coding in the boost is too hard for beginners
94200	95560	so who don't know how to code.
95560	99680	So we assume that you have had some Python
101240	104120	as your first language and or hopefully something else.
104120	107240	I mean, Python's a great first language for coders.
107240	109160	I mean, everybody knows this,
109160	110680	even I might not be my favorite,
110680	112400	but it doesn't matter, it's still the best one.
112400	115560	So my, if you're wondering what to do with the boost
115560	118280	and now all the rest of the content
118280	119120	from the beginner boost,
119120	120840	the terminal related stuff is covered.
120840	122800	I mean, we covered it all.
122800	124160	The only other things from previous years
124160	126200	that I covered in the boost,
126200	129640	skill stack related things were things like,
129640	132080	how to get ready for a job
132080	135040	and how to put yourself out there and stuff.
135040	137760	But mostly the beginner boost has always been about
137760	139480	becoming, mastering the terminal.
139480	143080	And that has got really clear boundaries now
143080	144640	so that we have boosts for everything
144640	147000	so we don't have this overlap.
147000	151640	So, this is my last take on what you should probably learn
151640	153200	in that way, what order.
153200	155440	And you can go look at this up.
155440	158440	This is in my bout or you can just come ask me.
159560	161200	And so you go with the Unix beginner boost,
161200	163160	which is pretty much just the terminal
163160	165240	and then becoming a pressure technology professional,
165240	167520	which is all the stuff related to how to get a job
167520	169000	and network and all that stuff.
169000	170680	That needs to be its own series.
170680	172440	And frankly, it needs to be its own book.
172440	173600	I don't know if that'll be the name,
173600	175640	but that'll be it.
175640	178800	And so I'm really emphasizing strongly
178800	180440	that there will be books created
180440	183600	to go with each of these boosts.
183600	185320	And so the first one I'm really obsessed with
185320	187080	and that's what I'm gonna be writing all day today
187080	192080	is gonna be the keg ML parsers
192720	194880	so that we can start writing the book
196320	198320	and publishing it and getting as close
198320	200600	as we can to publishing the terminal velocity book.
200600	202480	And when I say publish, I mean really publish.
202480	205040	I mean paper version, no starch press,
206600	207440	Amazon all that.
207440	208800	And I talk about that in another question.
208800	210680	So if you wanna know what to do,
210680	212520	if you're like, what happened to skill stack boosts?
212520	213720	I don't know what to do now.
213720	215280	Go learn Python.
215280	216480	There are so many ways to learn Python.
216480	219720	I just found a new book about how to learn Python,
219720	221520	which I'll talk about in another time.
221520	222440	It's really good actually.
222440	224320	There's a number of really, really great resources
224320	225480	for learning Python.
225480	226560	I don't need to cover that at all.
226560	228560	It's completely covered by the industry.
228560	229800	Learning the terminal is not.
229800	232760	So I'm gonna focus on the things that need help.
232760	236200	Learning go as a beginner is not covered very much.
236200	237120	There is a little bit of it.
237120	239520	There's learning go, which assumes that you know
239520	241080	how to code already and know a little bit of go,
241080	244160	but it doesn't, you know, and it's a good resource.
244160	245560	It is, it's a pretty damn good resource.
245560	248200	So I'm gonna let people go to that
248200	249440	if they wanna learn that.
249440	251320	And the people that have been with me on the boost
251320	253520	on Saturdays since we started doing co-programming
253520	254440	are wanting to learn go.
254440	256540	So there's gonna be tons of go programming,
256540	258260	but from now until January,
258260	261300	because I'm writing the parser and then, you know,
261300	263620	all this stuff for keg, and that's all gonna be in go.
263620	267820	So if you already know how to program
267820	272820	and you want to increase your go skills,
273860	276420	you can still come in and check in at boost time
276420	277940	and you'll be seeing me writing
277940	279540	and mostly coding in go, right?
279540	281220	We're gonna be doing a lot of Kubernetes stuff as well,
281220	282460	but that's generally during the week,
282460	283960	not necessarily on Saturdays.
283960	285940	So I do plan on keeping Saturday
285940	290020	dedicated to writing, you know, keg-related go code
290860	295020	and potentially, you know, a book related to go of my own,
296020	297540	but that's secondary to getting
297540	300900	the terminal velocity book done.
300900	304620	And then, so that's pretty much it.
304620	305460	That's what's happened.
305460	306740	If you wanna know what to do next,
306740	309500	you know, learn how to write your first program in Python,
309500	310380	go programming fundamentals.
310380	311580	At the same time, you can also learn
311580	315060	how to create containers, OCI containers,
315060	317260	you know, with PODMAT or Docker,
317260	319320	learn how to run local Kubernetes.
320980	322100	You could probably also learn
322100	323260	how to build your own desktop PC,
323260	324700	set up a Linux server.
324700	326460	This is also stuff that we're doing differently.
326460	331460	So the boost is not going to be the same next year.
332860	334860	So I'm just gonna say it right now.
334860	338100	So we still will have the tradition of starting something,
338100	343100	probably the terminal velocity boost on May the 4th.
343900	346900	But it's not gonna be called beginner boost anymore.
346900	349460	It's gonna be called whatever
349460	352020	should match the book title that it goes with.
352020	353460	And I won't be having any boost
353460	355780	that does not have a book written for it already.
355780	358340	So this is just something I'm really seriously going
358340	360620	to force myself to do over the next year.
360620	361980	I mean, I change my mind all the time,
361980	364620	but that is something that has plagued me
364620	369140	since the beginning because I am kind of loosey-goosey
369140	369980	in how I do it.
369980	371180	I know what my outline is and everything,
371180	373060	but there's nothing to show for it
373060	374340	after that other than the videos.
374340	375180	And then people are like,
375180	376020	well, how do I get through the videos?
376020	377100	And they have a rough outline.
377100	379220	If they have a book to go through,
379220	381500	like an actual book that I can update week to week
381500	384820	if I have to, and that's why I'm so interested in Keg
384820	386180	because Keg will allow that
386180	388580	other than printing something that's out of date next week.
388580	391340	Keg will allow me to have people
391340	393780	get the latest version of the book every week if they want
393780	396500	and contribute and add whatever.
396500	399380	So that is gonna happen.
400380	405380	And then, so the most likely possibility for next year
406180	410080	on May the 4th will be a link to this map.
410080	412100	Yeah, I have links to all the maps in my description.
412100	413740	At least I will.
413740	416200	If I don't have it yet, I will get you,
417220	418060	I'll get all of this stuff.
418060	421500	This stuff is all kind of like my free form thinking
421500	422500	about different things.
424500	427020	And there's no way to link to all of my stuff.
427020	428260	So I will be making a resource
428260	430100	to link to these different whiteboards
430100	431940	that I have, I have a lot of them.
431940	434460	And the whiteboards are gonna be based on
434460	435700	general topics and stuff like that.
435700	437300	The Home Lab and then it's another thing to do.
437300	440820	So what's happened to the beginner boost in a nutshell
440820	442660	is that it's gotten more specific
442660	445820	and it's kind of fractured into a lot
445820	447140	of other specific things
448300	452180	for which there will always be a book, a guide
452180	454140	or some publication from now on.
454140	457700	So I know that sounds ambitious for me to do that,
457700	461580	but I've always wanted to do this and it's time to do it.
461580	463220	And keg needs to be built.
463220	464140	It's actually more important
464140	465700	than even covering a boost every year
465700	466940	is making sure I get keg finished
466940	469220	so people can start building the knowledge exchange
469220	473260	or the keg network of, you know,
473260	474600	and share their knowledge and stuff like that.
474600	477260	So this, when we do it next year,
477260	479820	it'll be probably called the terminal velocity boost
479820	483060	and which is fine, you know, terminal velocity boost
483060	484980	and it will be like, what is that about?
484980	487500	And it'll be getting you fast on the terminal.
487620	490460	It will not include installing Linux at all.
490460	494500	It will include using bash as fast as possible.
494500	497940	And then there will be different boosts
497940	501100	if you wanna call them that or sessions or series
501100	504180	or whatever about how to get Unix.
504180	507220	And I'm talking about Unix, not just the center of Linux.
507220	509660	If you, you know, we're gonna go through, you know,
509660	514180	we'll have multiple series, you know, segments
514180	515580	about how to get Linux.
515580	517060	Because there's just, I mean, how to get Unix.
517060	519140	There's so many different ways to do Unix.
519140	520940	And in fact, I've always wanted to cover those things,
520940	522660	including, you know, installing on hardware,
522660	523500	which we can cover now
523500	525260	because I have a capture card that'll do it.
525260	527620	And again, those are all topics
527620	529620	that are covered a lot elsewhere.
529620	531020	What's not covered is, again,
531020	532740	the very specific thing about how to get fast
532740	533860	with the terminal.
533860	537900	And so that's my number one priority,
537900	540420	finish that book first and do the rest.
540420	544700	So the content from the boost is still there.
544700	547620	And the go programming, if that's what you want,
547620	549180	or, you know, the terminal stuff.
549180	551060	This isn't gonna be writing the book every day
551060	552180	or something about the book.
552180	554540	You'll be able to get that any time.
554540	556460	And then you can always go back to the videos.
556460	558380	And then what will end up happening
558380	561460	is the videos that go with for the boost
561460	564740	will get more and more polished every year.
564740	567580	And they'll become more segmented.
569260	570820	And eventually, probably,
570820	572540	they'll turn into Udemy courses,
572540	574740	which will be an option.
574740	575900	You won't have to do Udemy.
575900	578660	But if you want to do Udemy, you can.
578660	581700	Otherwise, you can, like, slog through the unedited video
581700	583940	that I used to make the Udemy stuff.
583940	585980	And there'll be a book that goes with it.
585980	590980	Okay, so that's what we are looking at.
594100	594940	All right.
