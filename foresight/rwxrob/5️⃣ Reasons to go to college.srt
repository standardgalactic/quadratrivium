1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Should you go to college? Whether you are young or old, the decision to go to college is a huge one.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
I already did a video on whether you should go to college or not.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The answer is probably yes, particularly in America, and in Europe it's free, right?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But in America you have to weigh the cost benefit and all of that.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But there's really five reasons to go to college, and the truth is if you can accomplish those things,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if you can do those things that you get from college in other ways,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and I'm going to share a couple stories of people who have done this,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
then I don't think college is as required, and I'm not the only one saying that.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are a lot of people who are not just old people, but young people who are now saying,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't need to go into massive debt in order to accomplish those five things.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So what are those five things? We are going to do H&L, CSS, yes.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So what are the five things?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The first thing is obviously people go to college to get a job.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now that doesn't necessarily, that's not usually the first reason to go to college that people go.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They don't even think of that, and usually they'll pick a major like psychology,

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
which I actually helped someone actually get a job after they got a major in psychology

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
because they couldn't get work.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not bagging on psychologists, I'm just saying that if you want a job,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you've got to get a degree that's going to get you a job.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I have a Russian degree, I actually had a job in Russia,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but my wife told me she didn't want to be in Russia anymore,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
so I had to re-skill, and I had to use a bunch of the things that I learned on my own in the computer lab

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
as a linguist in the computer lab and also by building out my own home lab

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
without going to college at all and continuing to go to college.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So the number one reason is to get a job.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now you can definitely qualify, you can learn the skills to get a job without going to college.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I made a whole video about why computer science might not be the right choice for you.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Computer science is definitely the right choice for certain professions,

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but not the ones you think.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you want to work for a Silicon Valley or any company that's doing tech things

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that's going to pay you a tech salary,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you're probably not going to want a computer science degree, honestly.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're probably going to want the skills that you would get

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
shooting to get a certification like a Red Hat certification,

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
or one of these is there's another video of me drinking while talking about the Red Hat certification

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because I really hate that the system and ComTA and all the certs that are out there

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that you can get to supplement your college.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Some of them are cheaper than that.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They're also not necessary to get a job.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And so another story, some time ago, I believe it was in 2013,

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
IBM made a very public statement about that they don't require anybody to have a college degree.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And they made a big deal of it and they showcased a few people,

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
one of whom got a security job for IBM at 18 without having anything.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They had a lot of knowledge.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I think that person may have actually had a security certificate of some kind,

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but the point that IBM was making and many other big companies did around 2013, 2014,

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that was a long time ago, was that you didn't need college.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And there's been overwhelming evidence that you still need to go to college to get a job,

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
which brings us to the second point.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So IBM created a system called K-16, which was this educational system

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
that took you all the way through the first couple years of college,

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and then you just would go through that and then you would,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and I don't even know where that landed.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know if there's a million.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But the second main reason to go to college is to get a job.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I mean, it's to actually make more money at your job,

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and that is statistically borne out by the science.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to refer to Adam Ruins College.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please go watch the video about this.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It talks about, yes, at every stage in their careers,

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
people that went to college made 30% more in America,

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and generally enjoyed better opportunities because they went to college.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I hate reporting that statistic.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I hate it because it shouldn't make any difference.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you have the skill, you should be paid for that skill, the end.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And so that's the second reason, to make more money,

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to get a job and to make more money.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Those are not the first two reasons that people cite to go to college.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Most of them, they cite it while they want the third one,

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
which is to find yourself, to discover what it is you want to be,

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to smell the roses and figure out what it means to be a thinker,

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
to take philosophy classes, to get high or get drunk

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and figure things out or to write poetry or to do whatever.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
People use college as an opportunity of self-discovery,

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and it's very expensive to do that.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
To go to college, to pay $3,000 or $4,000 a semester to find yourself,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it's an extremely expensive way to do that.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Take a gap year.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In fact, some colleges that are more responsible than others

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
have gone so far as to say,

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you can take a gap year and we will pay you a scholarship

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
for you to take a gap year before college even starts.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So you can figure it out what you want to be, who you are,

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
what you believe.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's a huge debate in the larger culture world

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
about the value of a college education, particularly now in 2024

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
when there's all kinds of radical things happening on college campuses

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because college campuses have traditionally been the places where progress happens.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's where people are testing the boundaries.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They're testing interpersonal boundaries,

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
they're testing their societal boundaries,

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and they're discovering things.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Some people would cite that that's the number one reason to go to college,

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and that's why we have to have colleges.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We have to have places where people can go and think and not care.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Not care about the bill that they're going to get

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
or the fact that they might lose their job.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Tenured professorships is one of the worst things that ever happened in the world

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because these people don't have to worry about accountability at all

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
because they have a job no matter what.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When is that ever a good idea?

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So finding yourself, who you want to be,

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
what is your career going to be, what are you going to do with your life,

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that is the third reason.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's usually one of the main reasons that people go.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Along with that, who are you going to meet along the way?

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This includes your potential life partner, particularly Mormon.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you're a Mormon, there was a joke, a running joke saying,

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
if you're a Mormon, you're going to go to college

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
because that's where you're going to meet your spouse.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So women who are not encouraged to get education,

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
they would go there to find a husband, they'd find their husband,

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
they'd drop out of school, and then they'd go back later in life.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's absolutely abysmally bad, it's a horrible thing.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because education for women is kind of downplayed,

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
they've since kind of come around on that,

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
but the point is connections.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're going to college to create connections.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Some of those connections are going to be lifelong friendships.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Some of them are going to be potential job opportunities.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I mean professors, right?

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Some of the friendships that I have made with professors

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
while I was in college have gone on to be some of the most valuable things

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
in my entire life, and I cannot say it any other way.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Some of the people that I met in college, the same sort of thing.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Of course I met my wife in college.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So the people that you meet in college are going to be

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
some of the most important people you're ever going to meet.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Again, it's a very expensive way to meet people.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I'm going to come back to that point

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
by telling some stories about alternative ways to do these different things.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And the fifth thing is to learn how to do your laundry.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
To put it bluntly, you've got to learn how to adult.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You've got to be a grown-up.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You've got to take care of your laundry,

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
whether you decide to live in your car or an apartment or whatever.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You've got to learn to do your dishes,

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
whether it's you only have one fork, one knife, and one spoon

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
so that you never have dishes piled up like I had to do because

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
otherwise nobody would ever do the dishes.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You've got to learn to get along with people that you're roommates with.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You have to be a grown-up.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have to learn how to manage your life.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You've got to do your finances.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You have to understand what it means to buy something,

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to buy your first computer on credit

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
so that you can build your credit in America,

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
so that you can survive in America because you have to have credit.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There's a professor, a good friend of ours,

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
who went her whole life without buying anything on credit

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and she can't do anything.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
She almost couldn't get a mortgage

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
because she was so responsible with her money the whole time

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
because she's not playing by the capitalist system.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't care if you like it or not.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I hate it.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's just the rules of the rules of the game.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So knowing the rules is half the battle.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So let's talk about some alternatives to doing those five things.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So to conclude primarily before we go out to the next part,

162
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
it's really important that you say to yourself,

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
okay, college has become the most convenient for many people,

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
albeit expensive, college is the most convenient way

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to do all five of those things.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They've got a dorm set up for you to help you learn how to adults.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They've got resident assistants to help you know

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
where to go get your vaccinations when you need it.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They've got all kinds of weird things.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
College campuses, since the dawn of time,

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
since the dawn of college campuses,

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
have been set up to meet the needs of those five things.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And it's extremely convenient for most people.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's also very, very expensive.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But why would knowing about those five things on their own be relevant?

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay, so let's give you a couple of examples.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
One of them is getting the skills to get a job

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and getting more money to get a job,

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
getting the credentials that are going to get you money to get the job,

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and maybe meeting people that would get you a job, right?

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's talk about those three things.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There's other videos on this,

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but let's say I'll do another video on online universities, right?

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But when you talk about a college experience,

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the general college experience, I went to football games,

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I had all the thing, is that, you know,

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
it's the opposite of an online degree.

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you go get an online degree from an accredited institution like WGU,

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and there's a separate video on that,

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
then you are not having many of those five experiences, right?

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But you're spending a lot less money.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So one of the ways to do the first three,

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
to make more money and get a skilled job skills,

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and me people are going to get you a job,

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
is to go to an online university,

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
which is way, way, way cheaper,

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
or focus on getting credentials or doing whatever else it takes

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to establish trust that you can do the job.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Those are things you can do on your own.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you took the cost, this is a true story.

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So my son went to a community college,

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
computer science 101 course,

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and there's 85 people in the room or something,

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and they asked him to raise his hand,

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and they said, does anybody here have any programming experience?

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And he raised his hand,

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
because he had already completely learned how to code in Python and Go.

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He'd made several applications in Go on the back end,

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and in actually JavaScript as well.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So, I mean, he knew how to code.

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He had proven, he had built online interactive WebSockets based games

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
with all of the components of programming in that realm.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So he had a lot of, I mean, the fundamentals of programming

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that were taught in CS101, he had a lot of them.

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then he proceeded to raise his hand.

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He was the only kid in the class who raised his hand.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He went up and talked to his professor at the end

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and said, is there any way I can test out of this class?

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And they said, no, I'm sorry.

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So he paid $2,000 for a course that covered material he already had.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I have another story about this.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Gabe, if Gabe out there,

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Gabe taught himself assembly when he was 16.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He ordered his own circuit boards that arrived via DHL from China

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
that he designed on SOLIDWORKS himself while he was with me,

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
while he was doing beginner booth stuff.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He literally had his pick of colleges,

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and when he went to his first college,

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
he had to take CS, whatever, to teach computer engineering,

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and he ended up teaching the assembly class.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He paid $2,000 for the privilege of being the unpaid TA for that course.

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And then he immediately became the TA.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He applied to be the TA, and he became the TA next.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He became the TA for the course, and now he's teaching all the play.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He was in the class. He knew everything.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He knew everything in the course, and he was totally frustrated,

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but he's like, whatever.

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He paid all this money because the system wasn't set up to let him say,

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
oh, I already know this, right?

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So there's a couple of takeaways from that.

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The first one is, you can learn any skill that's taught in college.

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can learn any skill that will get you.

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In fact, some skills that they won't teach in college, many.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
MIT very famously has a thing called the Lost Semester,

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
where they teach you how to use desktop Linux, among other things,

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
because it's not included as a part of the curriculum,

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
because it's not serious enough.

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's totally stupid.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And the point is, is that you can learn those skills other ways.

250
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You can make more relationships with other people in other ways,

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and you can do it for on the cheap way better.

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So WGU is another one of these universities where you can learn all those things.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Now WGU is going to leave you hanging on the other two things.

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're not going to meet as many people through WGU bottom line.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's not happening.

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's not going to be as society.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're probably not going to meet your spouse at WGU, right?

258
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You might make a business contact or two, but probably not.

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So that means you're going to need to actively go out to meetups

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and do the things that you have to do throughout your career.

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Anyway, might as well get started before college.

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In fact, one of the biggest complaints I have about college

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
is that because it so conveniently covers all five of those things,

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
when people leave college, they don't know how to do those things outside of college.

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But if you focus on preparing relationships at local meetups,

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
knowing what conferences to go to,

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
knowing who to hang out with,

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
building a group of professional peers and friends,

269
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
really a professional learning network,

270
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
if you're doing those things which you should be doing already,

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
then you've already learned the skill,

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and you haven't had to pay any money to college to learn it.

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You haven't become dependent on the college to cover that.

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And the colleges have an entire ecosystem of dependency

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
because they keep pumping in the whole alumni thing,

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
give us more money, come back as an alum,

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
help other people who go to this college

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
because you like our college better than all the other colleges, right?

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No.

280
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think it's a mistake for many people.

281
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So those are the five things.

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So if you go to WGU, how are you going to meet those other two needs?

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Learning how to do your own laundry?

284
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And what was the other one?

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Making money throughout your career?

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Meeting other people, I think.

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Learning how to adult is the thing.

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The best way to do that, and I'm going to share a story here,

289
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
the best way to learn how to adult and to meet other people on,

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
oh, no, discover yourself, discover who you want to be.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So I have a story from somebody that is indirect that I read some time ago.

292
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It was about a woman who went to college.

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
She went to Harvard.

294
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
She graduated in Harvard.

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And I don't remember her degree.

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And she wrote an article, I believe it's on Medium,

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that said everything, the most important things I learned,

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I didn't learn from college.

299
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And it's pretty much, the summary of it is,

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
she went bureau packing.

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
She went, you know, backpacking in Europe

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and living on the total cheap.

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And she just accounts, she just recounts all of the

304
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
really life-changing experiences that happened to her

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
while she was just walking around Europe,

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
meeting different people, staying in hostels,

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
getting to know, you know, others,

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and also thinking about what she wanted to be,

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
who she was going to be, what she was going to do with her life,

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and a lot of time to think and stuff.

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Some people do Appalachian trails.

312
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Some people live out of their car and travel across the country.

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You know, there are lots of opportunities to discover yourself

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
that do not have college impact.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And I would suggest that college is probably one of the worst places

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
for you to discover yourself.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a great place to be exposed to new ideas,

318
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
ideas that you might not have been exposed to

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
because you didn't know about that book,

320
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
or you didn't know who Joseph Campbell was,

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
or you didn't know, I mean, there's a million things

322
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that you may not have known.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But if you learn early, maybe after watching this video,

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that you can build yourself an autodidactic learning plan,

325
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
that includes reading and learning about the things

326
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
that constitute the bulk of self-discovery at college.

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You can do it.

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You can make your own self-discovery course,

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
or your own thing.

330
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And it can include interactions with others.

331
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It can include traveling the world.

332
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And it's going to be way, way, way cheaper than a study abroad.

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Story about that, when I did study abroad,

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I was like, I don't have the money.

335
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I was working three jobs to get myself through college,

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and this was in the 90s.

337
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know how people go to college now, right?

338
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I was working three jobs.

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I was like, I don't have money to pay $4,000

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
to go on a Russian study abroad.

341
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So you know what I did?

342
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was like, let me see if I can find a job.

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So I found a job.

344
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I found and got a job being an American,

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
being a Russian cruise translator,

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
which I later kept growing that job.

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Got a lot of experience in Russia.

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It was one of the most proficient Russian speakers

349
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
in my entire Russian department

350
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
because I was making money working in Russia.

351
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And I didn't have to do a study abroad for that.

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So I got paid to go to Russia.

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They paid to go to Russia.

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You know what a lot of those people who did a study abroad did?

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They would go to Russia, and because they didn't,

356
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
usually they weren't paying themselves, by the way.

357
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There was somebody else who was paying.

358
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They would go to Russia.

359
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They would go with their American roommate.

360
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
They would travel all around.

361
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
They'd speak English the whole time.

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They wouldn't learn anything.

363
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So they would be $4,000 lighter.

364
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
They'd come back.

365
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They didn't have any Russian skill.

366
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And they had no other experiences to talk or to speak of.

367
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Meanwhile, I came back and I had a lot of real solid experience

368
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
teaching people English, teaching them business skills,

369
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and learning how to do the whole thing in general.

370
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So the point of it is if you're going to be able to do this long term,

371
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you need to really have a plan,

372
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
and that plan should include self-discovery at a regular time.

373
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You don't need college for that.

374
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And whatever techniques you learn to find yourself,

375
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
such as yoga or going on a bike trip,

376
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you should be doing that anyway, right?

377
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You should be learning those skills anyway.

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So don't necessarily have to go to college for that.

379
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Even if you do go to college, figure out what that is.

380
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't need a field trip in my Russian honors class

381
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to show me Arches National Park

382
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
so that I can basically get Mormon stoned

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and recite poetry under an arch in southern Utah.

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I can do that all on my own.

385
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't need to pay money for that, right?

386
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So that's what I would suggest.

387
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And hopefully that's been a summary

388
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
of whether you should go to college or not,

389
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and what are some of the things.

390
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is a really tough decision,

391
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and the decision about whether to go to college or not

392
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
is fundamentally colored by those five things.

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Go ahead and review those for yourself.

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And let me know what you think.

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Put it in the comments.

396
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's just my idea that I've had with others

397
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
as we've talked about whether they should go or not.

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I do think that most people should get a college degree,

399
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and I'll do another video on that

400
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
about how to get the college degree as cheap as possible

401
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
if that works for you and your career plan.

402
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And you should have that plan

403
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
before you even think about going to college.

404
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I know it's crazy.

405
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Can you imagine actually knowing what you want to be in life

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
before you go to college?

407
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It can be done. I've seen it.
