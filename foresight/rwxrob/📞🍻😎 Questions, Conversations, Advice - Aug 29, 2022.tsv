0	3600	Okay, start. There we go. So we're now recording it. We're in dark mode today
4080	10920	Mostly because it's a total disaster in my room right now. But as you can see, there is a server taking form
11360	13360	It's coming alive
14000	19040	my server and I've actually got another playlist on YouTube called home lab in it
20160	21440	and
21440	23280	It will be
23280	26300	About how to set up your own home lab or how I set up my home lab
27080	28280	and
28280	34000	I don't know how or when I'll be recording that but we're gonna come to them
34000	37040	So the first question that is everybody still talking about so I'm gonna talk about it is
38160	40700	Did you buy all Raspberry Pi's in the world for your rig?
42280	49000	And you can't see it but like right up here on the top there's a 16 by cost me 250 dollars by the way
49440	52600	Yeah, 250 dollars to get an aluminum Raspberry Pi
53880	55880	Hot swappable
55880	57120	to you
57120	58440	rack
58440	60440	shelf and
60560	64000	Yeah, and I'm gonna be putting that there
65040	69760	For that if I know I didn't I actually have 30 or so Raspberry Pi's. I mean I keep finding them everywhere
69760	77040	I need to remind everybody I used to run a company. I founded a company called skill stack in 2013 where I was you know
77040	82440	Mentoring people in person at a school. I lived in a town home above it and the bottom floor was
82880	87600	Just lab in school. You can go to twitter.com slash skill stack SK
87600	88880	I'll
88880	94280	SDAK if you want to see pictures of it from from back in the day and maybe I need to show you that really quick
94800	96800	Because I want to
98240	104520	All right, so to our studio audience who can't you're an audio only I'm going to twitter.com and
105160	107160	I am pulling up some
107520	109640	nostalgic photos from skill stack my
110640	112640	Once popular
114120	120960	Place and this is where I have my curriculum and there's like pictures and all sorts of things and if you go to actually if you
120960	122360	Go to Instagram
122360	126080	You'll see some stuff. The question is about Raspberry Pi and that's what I wanted to show you
126440	128720	So actually Instagram is a little bit more fun
129520	131520	if you go to instagram
131920	133920	comm slash skill stack you'll see
135320	137720	Videos and stuff that I've done and including
138520	142560	So this is the there's my red rack behind me right behind my head
143360	149920	That used to be my really really really really cheap. I mean look at how ugly it is, but you got to understand
149920	152640	I ran my own company. I kept my costs really low
153440	157360	And so I didn't have a proper rack. I do now because I work for a
158240	165560	Big-ass company and I make a really cushy salary. So I've been dropping, you know, like $300 on to you Raspberry Pi
166560	171280	Thanks, but this this is like the thing so all these little green lights out the bottom by the way
171280	173280	Or I have 19 Mac minis that are installed
173920	175920	Which make really really great?
176480	179880	Cloud home lab kind of things. This is me organizing
180240	185240	That was when I had to move skill stack into my apartment to my house that I rented for two years
185240	190760	And then we moved here and so now as you know the ongoing saga. We're going to be moving within a year
191760	193960	To some other location. We don't even know where
194960	199280	To do my wife's MFA and we'll take a Raspberry Pi's with this
199280	204840	But no, we did not buy all the Raspberry Pi's, but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from. Oh, this is a great
204840	209560	This was a game camp. This was this guy this guy made his own like
210640	212640	amazing thing
214080	221300	We don't know where we're going so this is the game camp this was a summer camp that we had and that was my workstation at the time
222300	225060	But I'm just showing you this we had like lightsaber camp
225380	229940	It kind of stuck hot damn these kids are so young all these kids are in college now
231340	234860	They're all in college now. Oh, I just found the box with lightsabers
235540	237580	Yeah, I found the box of lightsabers
239060	244660	This guy like distro hopped like ten times in like a week amazing student
245660	247340	anyway, so
247340	249660	We don't know. I don't think it's gonna be Wyoming. No, I don't know where
250340	254740	So but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from so everybody's wondering where they came from
254740	256740	I know I'm not buying them up
256740	260700	They're leftovers. In fact, so where them people like why do you have all this apple?
260700	262700	I mean, there you go. This is what I wanted to show you
262900	264900	This is Raspberry Pi camp
265100	267100	Check that out. Check that crap out
267620	272300	He wrote that from scratch. He did it on himself the entire requirements
272300	273020	Look at this one, man
273020	278620	The requirements for this Raspberry Pi in case you can't see it the requirements for this Raspberry Pi class was just to like
278860	281660	make one of the things was blank and
282180	287820	He just he just kind of kept experimenting and putting wires everywhere and trying everything out
287820	291740	And he didn't make in his own full-blown like microcontroller extension
292380	296660	And I was like, oh my gosh, this is what happens by the way when you give
297380	298300	people
298300	300300	Freedom to be creative in their learning
301700	305320	Yeah, and so that's where the Raspberry Pi's came from so I have about 30
306200	309800	I have a sort of robot. This is the old this is the old apartment where I used to live
311120	313120	Before I got kicked out of that
313760	318960	You give them the freedom and they'll that okay. Here's another here's Sean. This is this was a this was us getting hacked
319760	322040	We we put a cloud server up
322160	323520	We put up a cloud server
323520	327000	This is security camp and we put a cloud server up and this is
327720	334480	The cloud server got hacked within a day during the camp during the week on camp. We said how long will it take somebody to hack us?
335080	339280	right and we were learning like all of these different commands and
340200	345480	his cloud server got hacked his his honeypot got hacked within a day and
346280	349880	And we were sitting there watching all the stuff it was doing and we were doing s trace
349880	354160	This is s trace. This is s trace on the the process that had hacked us
354160	359860	And so we could like see what the with the malware was doing and track it down and stuff. It's really really fun
361240	363160	Anyway, good times
363160	366720	No, he got we wanted to get hacked the people who got hacked first
366720	371020	They was like fishing like we were fishing. So if you got hacked first, you're one of the lucky ones
371020	375000	That means you got a bite. So he got a bot. He got a bite on the first day
376200	380080	And somebody hacked his closet. The whole point was to show how quickly
380800	383680	Unprotected did you see that royal typewriter right there by the way?
384600	388880	Yeah, that real typewriter is was part of I just spilled my coffee on myself
389480	393080	That's why I have a towel right here to protect myself from this kind of like mishap
393480	397000	Because I'm an idiot and it's also really dark. My coffee cup is brown
399120	404320	Hmm, I think I might have to add more vodka to it. I'm sure that was not a contributing factor
407640	411760	Are we still having fun master shells Matt you want in okay, here you come
412800	415520	You're gonna give me crap. I know but I'm used to it
418880	420880	All right, wait, wait, wait, give me a second
425480	431640	Hey Rob, hi, how are you doing? Audio is a little bit messed up. Let me fix the audio here my audio
437320	439320	Problem with my device
441320	446280	Anyway, so yeah, we did a lot of stuff there, but that's where the Raspberry Pi came from and I promise you
447280	453640	Uh, this whole open source contributed some coffee to the salt. No, thank God my map my laptop's closed
453840	459640	Yeah, so it wasn't it was only half full the guy or half empty whichever way you want to look at it
461040	464120	Hmm, and there's my old IP numbers. Anyway
468680	471760	Do I need to add that to the list so I have to answer that right now I
472760	477160	Mean I'm gonna add it to the list. Let's do that. I'll add that one right now answer that for you right now. Yes
478680	480680	Yes, I do
481240	483240	Anybody seen triumph of the nerds
484480	489360	If you haven't seen triumph of the nerds, then you don't understand what a compliment it is to call me a nerd
490120	492120	So go watch it
492200	493880	seriously
493880	498040	Seriously, if you have not watched triumph of the nerds, you need to
499040	501760	All right triumph of the nerds
503480	506160	Videos, I think it's out there for free. There it is
507040	509840	Excuse me 1996 documentary triumph of the nerds
509840	514200	it's like a three-part documentary that goes through the creation of
514840	516440	nerddom and
516440	520840	if you really want to understand the origin of personal computing and the internet there was a
521480	526040	Triumph of the nerds to the car. No, it was like two point two point one
526040	529120	I think and that was how the internet got made and
530480	536360	I think it's Bob cringely is the guy who did it the same guy who famously did the interview with Steve Jobs
536360	539960	Which they found old footage of which resurfaced near the end there
540080	544400	There's two point. Oh, if you want to get a real solid handle on
545600	552680	Technology history the most significant me can read the innovators, which is like a 300 400 page book or you can go
553000	558400	Watch triumph of the nerd. So if you haven't seen it cue it up. It's amazing. It's really fun
559280	561400	It's it's it's from a different time
562560	567200	Interestingly enough the guy who did this the guy who did this actually lived in Steve Jobs neighborhood
567200	569680	He worked for Apple computer when it was in a garage
570720	573720	And then and then it became so much more. So
574720	577280	I'll just tell you about that. So absolutely. I'm a nerd
577880	585280	But the real question is are you a nerd or a geek and if you haven't seen that nerd or a geek back when you could actually watch
587400	593880	When you could watch Rhett and link Rhett and link have completely sold out. They're just grifters now I
594680	597320	Used to really love Rhett and link. This was eight years ago
597560	605080	But if you haven't seen the epic rap battle of nerd versus geek which I cannot show here because we're doing you know a thing on YouTube
605840	607840	Make sure you watch it
608160	612040	If you don't know the difference between a need and a Gurt egg, did I say a neek a
612920	618040	Geek is like we I'm not gonna tell you what they are. You need to watch Rhett and link have this nice fight
618040	620880	It's really it's a really great rap battle. I think you'll really enjoy it
622520	624520	So they are definitely different
626880	628200	But
628200	632400	Like play it like ten times and slow it down and like listen to what they say
632800	636720	Because it it pretty much perfectly captures the difference between a geek and an earth
638680	641280	So that's that what this is a question
642440	645520	What's your favorite tech art anything related to goes logo? I
646560	648560	Really really really do like goes logo
650000	652160	those of you who know René René French
653280	654560	and
654560	657320	is is Rob Pike's wife and
658040	662160	The gopher is was designed by René French
663080	665360	Who has done many other things as well?
667640	668840	And
668840	670840	You could go you can go look at them
671400	673400	And and see about them
674040	678360	We can look at some of the different images here. So here is all of the thing
678360	684000	I really like I mean is is in fact René friend having been involved with artists a lot gone to a lot of art galleries
684000	689720	You can watch it in my rl streams on twitch some of which have been saved. I spoke coffee on myself as well. Well
691280	697320	My wife my René French actually reminds me of my wife a little bit. She's got that whole art look going on and
699080	703680	She's like really talented and you know, she's
705560	708400	She wearing Rob Pike's glasses there that looks like
709400	712680	It looks like she's wearing Rob Pike's glasses right there
713200	719440	That's her favorite glasses issue. It's like they're wearing the same glasses or something Rob Pike would usually wear glasses like that
719680	721680	So Rob Pike you made Go Lang
722080	727760	One of the primary contributors to go Lang is made this this is like one of the very firsts to go Lang
727760	733040	I absolutely love love love the artwork behind go Lang. It's probably one of my favorite
733280	742360	The I mean as opposed to for example, like the logo for Java, which you know was never any good
743000	745000	Where's the little guy? There he is
745760	752040	Duke the Duke logo, you know, I'm just not impressed. It was fine. It was okay. It was the 1990s
753520	757440	In terms of art and tech I do think they go well together. I
759640	762200	Actually made the logo for Tomel
763040	768640	I made it. I created it. I committed it. This is my logo
771400	776520	True story you can actually go look at the commit if you go look at the commit on the GitHub, you'll see that I made it
777360	779360	It was actually a joke
780800	783840	It was kind of a joke I made a pull request I
784680	787400	Made it seriously. I made her pull request
788280	792440	You want to see it? You want it? This is my like my one of my few claims to fame
793800	796440	I had to put it in a question for him in my stats of the ways
798560	800560	Yeah
801080	809080	Did you make the Tomel logo and the answer is yes, I did it's a very small claim to fame
809480	812480	But if you go to github.com slash Tomel
812480	815960	I also got Tom to kind of like pick up the pace
815960	819400	I was kind of on him because I was making a thing called file system as a database
819400	821400	which I still want to do with YAML this time and
822320	823920	I
823920	826000	Actually made Tomel Tomel spec
827320	834320	To oopsie to try to get people to look it up again. It's not there anymore. Damn it. I wonder if it's on github at all
835200	836520	It's a long time ago
836520	842160	This is it's interesting because I had no idea about anything on Rust and I actually burnt sushi for example one of the
842560	847500	The the pran the moderator and also one of the primary contributors to a lot of the Tomel parsing
847500	852060	He wrote Burt's issue made one of the part when they want it made the Tomel parser. That's really popular for us
852580	856300	He also resigned very very publicly and famously
856940	860820	From the Rust project over quote and I quote you can go read the PR
862180	864420	Hypocrisy among the Rust leadership
865020	869500	You can go read it if you want to read the whole drama and so actually funny because I kind of you know
869500	873380	Rub shoulders them a little bit while I was doing some of the Tomel parsing actually helped Tom Paletier
874340	879860	Do some of the that the Tomel parser with some of the test code for Tom for for
880300	883180	There's been super Susie's Tomel and again back then
883180	887220	I was thinking that Tomel was the one true way to create a file system as a database
887220	889220	We just have a directory and you put a Tomel file in there
889980	896020	Recursively and you end up with kind of a flat file database that's structured. I still want to do something with that with yaml cherry and I
896420	903360	Remember Ramirez. I forget her his or her name their name in the chat. We were talking about that the other day
904780	907100	And something I'd still like to go but some polities
907900	912500	Plenty is actually Tom Palletier is like one of the coolest people I have ever worked with an open source
913460	915380	and
915380	916460	because
916460	920060	Tom actually it's like, you know what I've always wanted to write a parser
920420	925380	I'm gonna write one and I'm gonna write it for Tomel and I think it's the I think it's better than Burt's issues
925420	926940	But whatever
926940	931500	And so actually evaluated it and this actually got me into writing my own parsers
931860	935820	So there's a lot of parsers out there. There's a lot of people who like obsess about this kind of stuff
935820	939860	So you can go out there and work with them. I do have some commits on here somewhere
939860	945140	Maybe my contributions are not that big big enough to site. I mean, I actually made a separate
946460	951580	Thing for the test code so it might be a separate repo that I did and I can't remember where it is
952500	955560	Anyway, but yeah, let me show you that actual official commit to them
956660	958660	to the Tomel project
958940	961820	Tomel laying the Tomel. Yeah, there it is
964100	967980	There it is there's my one commit to the Tomel project and
969140	972820	You can actually find it if you try to go I can't even remember where
975060	980100	Bob T logo, I mean, how would I put this I go through issues or code for requests
980100	982540	I'm just showing off at this point. What kind of show is this?
983060	984180	but
984180	988900	I'm super proud of it. So there so let's go search for logo
991260	996140	Alt Tomel logo change log Tomel has a logo. There we go
998500	1001000	What changes that was this one oh
1003260	1008500	That wasn't me no, where is it Tomel has a logo. Oh, they put it in the change log
1009500	1015060	Yeah, Tom Tom approved my pull request that that was the that was the thing I wanted to show you actually prove my
1015460	1019940	My poor cause I was like super happy Tom made get him by the way like made it
1020620	1022620	He also made gravator
1022620	1026060	So he's a big deal over in Silicon Valley. He's also does his own thing these days
1027180	1031420	You can read all of his there's some recent drama with somebody who worked with him on Twitter
1032100	1033940	but whatever and
1034060	1036980	Regiment js. Yeah, he's been a lot stuff. He's he's he's great
1038140	1039420	and
1039420	1041700	You know see all results I get a
1042380	1046740	No, I where's my local commit. I'm gonna have to I want to find it. I hope they didn't delete it
1046740	1048740	That was like that's like my
1049540	1051380	My one small thing
1051380	1057660	I don't even think I'm gonna register as a contributor because I was like my only contribution to the whole project ever and it was kind of a joke
1058460	1062580	Seriously, it was a joke. I was like here. Okay. I'm gonna have to find it because it's a fun joke
1062580	1064580	Is it logos?
1065100	1067460	Yeah, is it? All right. Let me go find it. I
1068220	1071980	Don't know if that's gonna know damn it. Of course. I have to do like Maine or whatever
1073820	1074980	I
1074980	1079220	Help me help me Obi-Wan Kenobi logos. Okay. This is yeah
1079940	1084380	sink get attributes for Tom all Tom on PNG six years ago
1085820	1087820	What?
1088820	1094100	Uh history let's go look at the history added logos. Yay me
1097060	1099060	I'm in a contribution
1101620	1105700	Seriously, you know the feeling the first time you get one of your I don't care how sick I mean, you know
1105700	1108820	Chris know this committing to the Linux kernel and I'm like making logos for Tom
1109380	1115540	Same things. I mean in terms of like sick, you know, happiness, you know, so I like yeah, I did this added logo files
1116100	1120140	Seriously, it was like it was like 1 a.m. Some night and I was like, you know what?
1123940	1127020	Obviously everything is like everything is just a square bracket
1127020	1130780	So let's just do this and then the PR is something. Where's the PR history?
1131580	1135460	Where is this actually say the does it actually say it? Where's the PR?
1135460	1141660	I don't I don't know get as well as I should I kind of do but not as well as I should
1141740	1148420	I'm trying to look for the commit history because it said it said, you know, I won't care if you don't commit it
1148420	1150420	It's just kind of fun
1152020	1155300	Yeah, I don't I don't see like it's my comic got squashed or something. I
1156420	1161700	Oh, I don't I don't I don't see it anymore. Let me see. Where's it? You know the feeling?
1164100	1165780	Yeah
1165780	1167420	Yeah, well
1167420	1173600	So whatever, I mean Mike I did make a the PR wait pull request. Maybe it's in there. Oh, maybe it's in here
1174100	1176100	It's close. It's it's close
1178020	1180020	It's closed or an extra on
1181820	1184020	Damn Rob
1186500	1188500	Damn
1191180	1193960	There's no record how far back to have to go
1194920	1202440	Can have equals lost of I know I do feel lost. I mean how far back to have to go can I can I can I do a search?
1205640	1207640	Logo oh
1210640	1216800	There it is took a shot at logos. Yeah, my feelings won't be hurt if rejected figured what the hell
1216800	1221840	That was so much fun
1221840	1226000	I seriously it was like, you know, it was late at night. I'm like, what the hell? Let's just try this
1226000	1231240	So because I was trying to get it to pick up steam. I actually created tumble dash spec
1231720	1237720	Which I think didn't get picked up. I mean, but anyway, I really like it because now they use it for everything
1237720	1242760	It's like all over now. You can go on the internet and search for tumble logos and I made it
1243240	1245240	It's like my logo everywhere
1247000	1249000	So there are rust people
1249440	1254280	Every time a rust comes out and the rest people come out to me like yelling me. Okay, but but but I made the Tomo logo
1255320	1259920	Because you know rust uses Tomo. I mean rust can the rust contributors are like Bert Zushi in the gang
1259920	1264560	I mean, they were like fundamental to the creation of Tomo and making sure it became cool and all
1266160	1272680	There's many other cooler logos than mine, but it was just a shot at it. Look. Oh my god. It's even on Wikipedia
1272840	1274840	My logo is on Wikipedia. I
1275720	1278120	Can't stop. I just can't stop
1280440	1283160	This is saying anything about the logo who made a logo
1283880	1287400	To verbose that's true. That's why I don't use it. I use YAML these days
1288640	1292400	It doesn't say anything about the history of the logo. I should like make a Wikipedia edit
1293480	1295480	Where did the logo come from?
1296200	1302720	Rob was bored on one random night. I know I should like edit it and add it. I should say I made the Tomo logo
1303440	1305960	So, I mean, it's a small thing
1306600	1312480	But it's the small thing. I should I do it right right now. I have to don't have the login or something
1313120	1316040	Where should I put it? Where should I put it if I'm gonna do this?
1317040	1320520	Shit, I'm scared. You're scaring me
1324240	1326240	I need to put like
1326680	1332320	Criticism, it's like just criticism. Holy cow. Why don't we have history and then it's like the logo
1333720	1336760	I'm kind of nervous because I don't do Wikipedia ever
1338000	1341000	Example criticism see also external links at it
1342520	1345400	I'm used to I I set up a Wikipedia
1346040	1352000	Site for IBM when I was on my team there and now I feel like I don't know what I'm doing
1352280	1356120	So it's probably not the thing to do during our Q&A session, but I don't have to come back
1356560	1358520	I'll have to come back and add it. I tell it
1358520	1362520	I'll put it I'll report a request to that to the community if there's anybody in the community
1363000	1368880	Who actually knows how to do Wikipedia edits and has an account and has done so like reliably go go go add that
1368880	1370880	I made the logo
1375440	1378080	Put that on my tombstone made the Tomo logo
1379480	1381200	When I die
1381200	1383200	My greatest accomplishment
1383320	1388680	Your email or something, you know, okay, not now, but maybe maybe someday
1388680	1393920	I do need however to bookmark this. I put that in my little cast then. Yeah
1394520	1396520	Zett create
1396920	1398920	just a reminder I
1400880	1408960	Create the Tomo logo. How do we get in this? I don't remember how we got we got an art. We got an art. That was it. Yeah, I
1409120	1411360	I
1411360	1413360	Did I made all the skill stack art?
1414360	1416560	I made the van art
1417280	1419280	oops wrong thing and
1420320	1421600	Stuff
1421600	1423680	So I actually love graphic design. I
1425000	1429480	Don't spend nearly enough time doing it. I made like the can logo and some stuff
1429480	1434880	I really really love graphic design. I particularly grab, you know, like icons and stuff like that
1434880	1437880	That's something I really enjoy doing. I think it's a drafter in me
1437880	1441320	I used to do a lot of drafting and map making for Dungeons and Dragons and stuff like that
1441840	1446680	Do we have any other Dungeons and Dragons fans out there former players of Dungeons and Dragons or current?
1447440	1450400	Because that really got me into that type of art
1453280	1455480	So so yeah, I
1456480	1461600	Was going to show you that the Instagram of that. I mean, I'm still this is still a question
1461840	1466880	Oh, here's my wife's plate page. So I am married to Nicholas. I'm gonna say Nicholas to Doris Kappner
1468240	1471920	Who is in the other room and insisted I have coffee with her today?
1472960	1475600	Uh, oh boy movies get off that real quick. Um
1476720	1479920	She is doing sculpture. She's obsessed with sculpture lately
1480720	1487040	Uh, but yeah, and so being married to her is kind of nice because she's just she's not really interested in digital art
1487680	1490480	Uh, and I kind of am I kind of obsessed with I've built
1491440	1494560	Uh, you're talking about art, right? So I built ed tech retreat
1496000	1498000	Uh, I get to brag about this. I guess
1499600	1502720	Uh, I I in second life I built the entire thing
1503760	1508800	Um, this I made this logo from scratch from scratch including the shading everything
1508800	1511040	I was super proud of it. I made t-shirts with that logo on it
1511440	1515440	I made a 3d rendition of the thing that like rotated over my head and blah blah blah
1516400	1518400	I mean, this was a long time
1518880	1520400	so
1520480	1524320	I mean, this was really a long time ago. This is before my divorce
1525120	1528400	Etc. We had dance parties. God, we had fun. We had so much fun
1529520	1532080	And there's actually images of ed tech retreat
1532800	1536480	Uh, so this that here this is the um
1537360	1540720	architect rendering of the thing I eventually built in full
1541840	1544320	Um, anyway, so there's like a flicker
1545360	1548080	Feed on this. I mean you were asking about logos and art and stuff
1549040	1551840	So that's kind of what triggered this
1552960	1557200	Uh, there's no flicker feed for a tech retreat. That's so sad
1557840	1559600	I feel bad
1559600	1561680	I feel bad that all of our pictures are not there anymore
1562640	1565120	I think there's like a twitter feed for that too
1566880	1569600	Ed tech retreat
1571280	1576080	Uh, that was an amazing creative endeavor. I really really like to oh we already hear
1576960	1578960	Is it instagram? Maybe it's instagram
1579920	1581440	Is it instagram?
1581440	1583440	Instagram might have more things
1583600	1585600	Okay, remember, I don't think there was an instagram back then
1587440	1590000	We go we click we click on things and go to the different
1591680	1593680	Amy I haven't seen her forever
1594640	1598560	Uh, yeah all these amazing people that were educators
1599280	1601280	And I got into education
1602160	1604160	through
1604800	1611120	Through this through twitter actually, uh, I wanted to get into education. I wanted to do more than just, you know work
1612240	1614400	and couldn't find it but uh
1615840	1619920	Ed tech retreat mohacks. This is my avatar
1620960	1622960	Custom had all reggae goes design nice
1623440	1628880	Uh, jump ushaw jump ushaw. We actually paid this guy $3,200 to architect our island for us, and then I built it
1629920	1631680	um
1631680	1633360	but yeah
1633360	1637120	I mean and that but you were talking about art. That's so I think that's where it came up
1638160	1641120	Uh, I'm trying to I'm trying to find my
1642160	1646400	Images, but I I think they're probably gone at this point. It's been so long ago
1648400	1650880	Uh, yeah, nothing nothing here
1652720	1654720	Nothing here, man. That's kind of crazy
1655520	1658480	It's kind of crazy because there was so much stuff on there. We had like
1659440	1663440	Lots of content, but it looks like it's all gone now. Anyway question
1665680	1668640	What was the question question was
1669920	1674560	Uh, what's your favorite favorite tech art anything related to goes little so I
1676080	1678320	Yeah, I mean, that's that's my favorite. Um
1679360	1682400	You know, I worked for Nike for a while and we did we did tech art there as well
1682480	1684000	But nothing like that
1684080	1689440	Tom a logo is the one this is my silly one that I made then I did a lot of art in second life in the 3d worlds
1690400	1692400	Um, all right. So next question
1693920	1697040	Uh, what is the cheapest homelab server I can buy so I actually
1698640	1700640	Seated this question
1700720	1706480	And because I've been getting this question a lot because I built a homelab server and I'm you know putting all my old hardware on there
1706480	1709920	But we found the the hp z
1710800	1713280	Uh, 640 and 600 series
1713840	1715840	to be by far
1716480	1719200	Uh, the most affordable after a day of research
1720480	1723200	So, uh, I actually bought this server
1724320	1729200	And it's renewed. This is a different one. This is not the same one. This is only eight core
1730000	1732000	But you can get them
1733120	1735120	For all kinds you can get them
1735440	1738400	Uh, there's a 32 gigabyte memory. That's a smaller one
1739360	1743760	Um, but yeah, I mean you can like stack them, right? So I actually have one
1745520	1748240	Um, let me see if I can find it hp
1750080	1751680	Yeah, here it is
1751680	1757360	Uh, this is the actual one. Okay, and yes, the docs is my location. That's fine
1757920	1760800	Um, so this okay, so
1761520	1764880	Let me I have to tell you something about this. Okay. So this price tag
1765040	1768400	2250 $2,252
1769040	1770560	Includes
1770560	1773120	Uh, and this is something I didn't notice at first. It includes
1773920	1775360	um
1775360	1777360	2 by
1777680	1780240	This is the part I missed when I was looking at the specification
1780720	1788480	You see the 2 by it says 2 by z on 14 core processors. This system I have for $2,300
1789520	1790560	has
1790560	1792560	28 cores
1793200	1795200	That can be doubled
1795600	1798640	28 dual cores. So so it has a total
1799360	1803920	Of 56 possible cpu's when you're allocating virtual machines
1805280	1807440	And it has 120 28 gigabytes
1808160	1811200	Uh, which could be upgraded um ecc memory
1812400	1820160	And 512 gigabyte solid state drive for $2,300 and I defy you to find anything that's cheaper than this
1820960	1823600	So far it's been running really solidly. I have it over here running
1824080	1829840	Uh, and I'll keep reporting on it, but this by far is the cheapest I was able to find
1830640	1836320	Uh online. I I don't have any recommendations for any, uh, crypto of any kind. I don't do that stuff
1837200	1838560	um, but
1838560	1840400	but in terms of like
1840400	1846320	Home lab and like instantly being able to make your own Kubernetes clusters or putting if you're going to do proxmox
1846320	1850880	Just put it on here. Don't put it on anything above 14 nodes or your cluster will collapse like mine did
1851360	1854560	And we'll get to that. Um, so this is a fantastic
1855520	1857520	Uh way to go
1857920	1862080	If if you want to do that, this is by far the cheapest thing I've ever found
1863120	1864320	Uh
1864320	1868720	Another there's another question. Why do you prefer linux as a subsystem within windows?
1869440	1870560	uh
1870560	1872560	I prefer
1872560	1877120	Linux as a subsystem within windows because and I've answered this lots and lots of times
1877920	1880240	But I will just give you the short answer
1880880	1882240	because
1882240	1883840	I stream
1883840	1884800	game
1884800	1886800	And I use windows at work
1887440	1891760	Because they don't allow you to lose linux on your desktop at work and 99 of the places you're going to work
1892320	1894320	You can't use linux on your desktop
1895200	1897200	So that's the main reason
1897680	1900960	Selfishly the main reason that I use windows for streaming and everything
1901440	1906480	Is because the streaming tools and obs are over the top better than anything on linux
1907280	1909440	Uh, you can't do it on linux. I did it for a year
1910000	1912000	Uh, but it sucks
1912080	1918960	And anybody who tells you differently is lying to you. They're told I can objectively rip down any argument that says
1919600	1923040	That linux streaming is just as good as windows streaming. It absolutely is not
1923760	1926640	Absolutely is not. Let's mention if you're going to do gaming
1927360	1934000	Right and I know linux gaming has come a long way, but it is nowhere near windows gaming not even close
1934720	1939040	So I do windows gaming and I haven't had a hiccup. I actually my windows machine
1939600	1940640	Uh
1940640	1943120	Goes stays running these days up to a month
1943840	1948080	Uh, I don't have to reboot it for anything even if it has system things that says hey, you should probably reboot
1948080	1949920	I'm like fine. I'm gonna wait
1949920	1955360	And then so what I do is I run a virtual machine that's got a gigabyte surround and two or three cores
1956080	1962800	Uh on side inside of my windows machine and then I ssh into it just like I would do if it were over there
1963840	1965840	And in my new home lab
1965840	1970160	Uh, I'm going to start doing that even more. In fact, they have the same name
1970240	1972560	I have anton as the name is kind of a you know
1973360	1975360	A nod to silicon valley
1975360	1980080	And and I'm going to be sshing into anton, which is now living over here
1980480	1984000	And we'll be on a ups and can run 24 seven blah blah blah blah
1984720	1988640	And then I don't have to depend on a vm for anything, but it but it's kind of a stage, right?
1988640	1991840	So, uh, if you don't have that if you don't have a server yet, then
1992560	1997520	Um, you you might want to consider a virtual machine that's running a one-two server specifically
1998240	2003760	Way better than red hat across the board for reasons. I'll talk about in a bit and
2004640	2006240	um
2006240	2008800	And and then I I just use windows for everything else
2009760	2012400	And then my my work computer officially is a mac
2012960	2017680	And I also have a mac so this whole bigotry about what computer you use
2018000	2021040	You just need to get over it on my opinion because
2021840	2023920	I mean mac hardware is top of the line
2024800	2025760	and
2025760	2029760	I mean and I actually might these mac minis are rock solid
2030320	2034000	I have been running these mac minis in my cluster for
2034720	2038160	Over three years and they are silent. They don't put out any heat
2039360	2043040	They just are really really good hardware and they have just really great design
2043600	2045920	So they're fantastic for for running linux
2046480	2052400	Unfortunately red hat doesn't agree that linux the red hat linux should be run on a mac and so they decided to not support it
2052720	2056240	Which is one of the reasons that I abandoned red hat and open shift
2057040	2059760	um, and and I'm going to actually talk about that now
2060560	2062560	so
2063760	2068640	So in a nutshell I've been complaining about this a lot recently and I'm just going to go out and just going to say it
2069360	2070560	um
2070560	2072160	and
2072160	2075840	By the way, if you get a chance to run linux on your desktop like I did at ibm for 12 years
2076560	2078080	Go for it. It's a really great way
2078080	2082000	I ran fedora on my desktop because I supported red hat at ibm
2082560	2085120	For 10 or 15 years and I wrote
2085680	2089680	rpm packages to install software. I know red hat inside and out
2089680	2092640	I owned stock in red hat in 2002
2093200	2097840	And sold it by the way after they did the whole fedora crap. So let me tell you a story
2099280	2102800	I know you like it when I tell stories. So I'm going to tell you a story. How much time do I have?
2104320	2110560	Uh, stories are easier for me to make my point. Okay, so way back when there was a company called
2111200	2115120	Uh red hat. All right, so I think that red hat started when did they start anybody know?
2115920	2117920	So red hat
2118560	2119760	started
2119760	2123520	When I want to say it was something like 99 98
2124640	2126640	um
2127520	2129520	Uh for more headquarters
2131040	2133040	Uh, let's see opening
2133920	2137600	American Subs today founded in 1993. Wow, really. Okay. That makes sense
2138160	2141760	Yeah, because 93 94 that was when yeah, no, that's that sounds about right
2141920	2146800	It sounds about right because that was when 94 wasn't when I got into the Linux really good. Actually. No, god. It was before that
2149280	2151280	No, they must have been
2151360	2153520	They must have it. No, they just weren't popular yet
2154240	2156080	Okay, so here's the story
2156080	2162320	So, you know travel in time with me back to the 1990s when Linux became a thing a big thing
2162640	2166480	In fact, right before that unix was a big thing. Everybody was into
2167120	2171600	Indigo colored, you know, 80s colored work stations that were nice and pretty
2172240	2175200	And it was all about the work station. In fact, that led to
2175600	2179520	Steve Jobs making next step, which was a work station
2179520	2185040	It was all about work stations all about 3d as when Pixar was created and we would move past the pc
2185120	2186800	We moved past pcs
2186800	2191840	You know the max and the ibms and all that the people used to get worked on and accounting stuff and all that
2192320	2197840	And we kind of moved into this new age of like work stations work stations were the cool thing
2197840	2205040	These were these like 10 000 systems that sat on your desktop for doing 3d modeling and and drafting
2205440	2211840	And you know, whatever. I mean like really amazing stuff right and that was also the dawn of the worldwide web
2212640	2215840	So we started to see these things doubling as web servers and blah, blah, blah
2215920	2217920	so you go back to that time and
2219600	2223840	Unix was proprietary. There was a unix provider called Solaris
2224720	2229680	Which was founded in stanford for free by the way, according to the stanford university policy
2229760	2232160	Which says you can start up very interesting story
2232480	2237840	If you want to see thank you for this something if you want to see the full story of Solaris
2238400	2244480	I cannot recommend more. It's very boring, but recommend more triumph of the nerds 2.01
2245360	2250720	Which goes through the creation of the internet and it talks about macabre, you know, the uh, what's his face?
2251280	2257760	Uh, who started some microsystems and then you know, uh, he was I mean, it's it's there's a lot there to talk about
2257760	2259760	Either creation of ethernet and all of that
2260480	2265840	So anyway, Solaris and sun microsystem who by the way, if you happen to recognize the name later invented java
2266560	2272080	Uh, and then marketed it for 500 000 dollars the largest marketing budget of any language ever in history
2272560	2273760	um
2273760	2277040	Became a thing so the ellison it wasn't ellison. That was oracle
2277840	2281600	Yeah, it was a completely different thing happening. It was very very proprietary
2282400	2284240	No, Larry Ellison made oracle
2284240	2287280	No, I'm I'm thinking of macafe the guys started three come
2288080	2290080	Oh god, let me get his name
2290080	2291200	uh
2291200	2293200	Who started he was part of the
2293840	2299920	Uh, he was part of the original uh, palo alto crew at his iranx and then he's he forked off his own thing
2300880	2302400	um
2302400	2304400	And it's it's like escaping me
2304960	2310480	Robert Metcalfe, that's it. It's not macafe. That's this that's the software guy. That's the security guy. It's Metcalf
2310800	2312800	Robert Metcalfe 1979
2312800	2314080	um
2314160	2315760	so
2315760	2317760	uh, okay, so
2317760	2318960	anyway
2318960	2319920	um
2319920	2321920	In this atmosphere of like
2322240	2326240	You know, we need to the AT&T unix was 3000 dollars a seat
2326640	2332160	And so there was lots of stuff coming up. Berkeley made bsd. Berkeley, you know that at Berkeley. They made it
2332640	2337360	Uh, there was lots of people experimenting at torwald's across the the world was experimenting with making
2337840	2341120	Uh a replacement for minix, which was was college professor's colonel
2341520	2345520	And that then he came up with linux, but they didn't have any way to talk to anybody else because there was no internet yet
2346880	2348080	Yeah
2348080	2350080	I think the stream dropped
2350400	2351760	But it could be my internet
2351760	2356400	Oh, I hope I hope not and please confirm for anybody else that the stream is dropped. I I still see
2357120	2359120	I see a a red bit rate
2359920	2361920	Says he went offline
2362400	2365200	Uh, but i'm not offline. It says i'm still streaming
2365760	2367760	Going up and now you're back to zero viewers
2368640	2370640	Yeah, what's up with that?
2371920	2374560	It dropped 30 seconds. It's back
2377200	2379200	That is really weird
2380480	2382480	Um, is it back?
2383920	2389600	I mean, uh, yeah, it's back now. It is back now. Okay. Well, thankfully that'll still be on the youtube
2390080	2392080	Mostly just me talking, but thank you
2392800	2394800	Uh, you dropped for me
2395680	2398800	Yeah, I don't know what dropped. I can't begin to
2399520	2402880	Guess maybe it's my server. I don't know. We'll see probably not, but
2404000	2408720	Everybody back. Okay. So so anyway, let me finish the story. So, uh, at the time
2411600	2414400	You know, people were thinking about different versions of unix and everything
2415280	2416320	and
2416320	2418720	So there was slack where there were lots of options
2419680	2424560	And one of the biggest ones early on the alternative the unix was solaris, which is proprietary
2424560	2428640	But it was still kind of freeform and everybody loved it because they had a better attitude
2429120	2432080	And but they were still proprietary and at the same time
2432400	2435760	Linux kind of became a thing because it's like no, we really want something that's free
2436400	2439840	and it was actually, uh, the guy who taught me about unix
2440320	2442720	Who I said, man, I wish I had this at home and he turned he goes well
2442720	2445680	He can always run linux and so I started running linux at home
2446480	2447520	and
2447520	2448720	um
2448720	2453280	And at the time there weren't that many options that I had a power pc mac because I was doing web design and thing
2453760	2456080	And so I I ended up doing mock linux
2456800	2460960	Later I would get a p2 opinion and I would end up running
2461520	2464880	Slackware for a while and then I would try mandrake linux, which is susie
2465200	2468880	And eventually I would use red hat and red hat came out when red hat came out on the scene
2469680	2471680	It was a big deal
2472480	2479120	Red hat was a huge deal and it was probably the most important free, uh distribution on the planet
2480000	2484560	Now fast they promised, you know, that they were going to support everything and and everything in it
2485040	2487040	And that was really great. Everybody was really behind it
2487600	2493200	Uh, and then 2002 or something came around and they decided to make fedora and they said look we're going to make
2493840	2497920	Uh red hat proprietary in other words, we're going to sell it for the to the enterprise
2498480	2500320	Uh, and we're not going to release red hat
2501040	2503280	for use by the the community, but
2504000	2507760	We're going to make this thing called fedora so people can volunteer their time and effort
2508080	2513040	And build up fedora and we can steal all of their innovation put it into our product and sell it
2513760	2518640	Because that's what they did and at the time there was a major major
2519520	2520880	like
2520880	2522880	Backlash against red hat
2523440	2526800	I mean, it was a serious backlash anybody that's that old might remember it
2527360	2533600	Um, but they were a disaster. I mean, they were a disaster of a company making horrible decisions
2534080	2536560	Moving into I mean not horrible decisions
2536640	2539920	Maybe decisions that were in their best interests that we're going to make them a lot of money, which it did
2540640	2543280	And they became the standard distribution for enterprise
2544080	2546080	And everybody else was like man, we want to do that too
2546640	2549600	So that was pretty much the first open core company
2549920	2553200	That's a term coined by git lab, which means their product is open source
2553200	2555360	But they make money on it on the side by all their
2556000	2562800	Proprietary add-ons and if you really want to get into this go watch dalman talk about all the little proprietary crap that they
2563280	2569040	Inject into linux in order to stick their hooks into enterprise and make them pay big subscription rates and stuff
2569680	2573040	So and that you might be fine with that, you know, you might be fine with that
2573040	2575200	But that is not the linux way
2575200	2579760	It is not the fos and open source way and there was a massive backlash against it
2580000	2586560	But nobody cared because red hat was making gobs and gobs of money because it was bringing linux into the enterprise and to this day
2587280	2589520	red hat is still so
2590400	2595040	deeply deeply embedded in the enterprise that ibm bought them for 30 something billion
2595680	2602640	And now consider changing their name for a moment. Apparently that's that's the rumor to red hat because it was so significant
2602640	2608480	So now ibm, you know, who brags every year about how many software patents it has
2609040	2613280	And keeps back engineers from becoming distinguished engineers unless they don't get a patent
2613680	2619440	Who lied to me in the 1999 with the peace love and linux campaign or to get me in the door and then turns out
2619440	2621680	It's all a bunch of bullshit
2621680	2625200	That company is the company that now owns and operates red hat
2625200	2631760	And if you think for a second that red hat is ever going to do anything in the best interests of the overall linux community
2631920	2637200	You'd be mistaken as a company individual engineers at red hat will
2638000	2642160	There's many many individual engineers and they support open source and they're doing amazing things
2642720	2643520	uh
2643520	2648880	The most controversial linux commit that ever happened in my history is system d
2649520	2655440	The guy who invented it invented it at red hat for the sake of enterprise because enterprise had a specific need
2656320	2662080	And they said that they had a specific need and they made it and they pushed it in and they got it in all of enterprise
2662080	2666880	And now it's in a bun tune. It's in everything else. It's highly controversial. I'm actually still okay with it
2667280	2672080	Slightly the guy that made it by the way. I guess where he went he quit from red hat and he went he works for microsoft now
2673120	2676880	Which if I if you know anything about the history of linux
2677120	2683280	The idea that the lead engineer the person who got death threats for creating system d is now working for microsoft
2684320	2689760	I mean, it's all I have to say about that and you just know what i'm talking about now microsoft ironically has moved forward
2689920	2694000	And they are more pro linux than I think sometimes even red hat is
2694560	2696640	I mean, you know, they're doing they're still very proprietary
2696640	2699840	But the the point is is that all of these companies that said that
2700160	2705280	Balmers words exactly that linux is a viral operating system and any company is crazy to install it
2706080	2710080	Are all like changing their tune and saying oh linux is awesome. We're going to do it
2710960	2714320	Uh, do you think non non system d distros are a big deal? I don't know
2715360	2720240	Uh, I don't know. I I don't think you can get away without system d reasonably
2720320	2723760	There's no motivation behind it if you're going to do that you might as well just go bsd
2724080	2728480	And there's a lot of software that there's a lot of like, you know routers and stuff that use it still so
2729280	2734480	Uh, nobody knows the system d a system d replace it replace the init system that it's kind of
2734960	2739920	And there's many advantages of it and disadvantages the advantages are you have this monolithic startup system
2740000	2742000	That's not really unixy
2742000	2746160	Um, but it has you know state so it can keep track of things better
2746720	2752160	Uh, it can be more secure and but it you know at the cost of being this big monolith that has to be deployed
2752240	2756240	It has all control to the whole system. It's a very very controversial thing
2756800	2762640	That controversy has largely passed though and it's now the standard in all enterprise linux distros
2763120	2769520	Uh, so uh, but bsd unix which is still the primary distro used in router software
2770000	2772000	And stuff like that does not use it
2772400	2777440	Uh, and it still uses the traditional init system. So you have to go do your own research on that. Um,
2778160	2779200	I
2779200	2782480	I don't really don't have an opinion on that. I do think
2783280	2789040	That we kind of have to make some, you know con concessions. I mean cononical and shuttleworth taught us that
2789600	2794400	That the linux world has to make concessions with the enterprise community if we're going to move linux forward
2794720	2800640	So it's kind of a delicate dance. You have to you know make in order to to to walk that middle line
2801200	2805440	But red hat is clearly not and this is this is the tipping point for me. Okay
2806400	2808560	And I know the question was about open shift and I'll get to that
2808560	2812000	But the question the the question is about, you know, red hat and open shift
2812000	2818640	So this weekend and I wrote about this so might as well if you want to go read about it this weekend. I I installed
2819760	2822480	Red hat on my mac mini, okay
2822880	2823840	And I was like, okay
2823840	2828000	I installed rocky linux and uh, which is you know red hat and I went through all the problems
2828000	2832560	It's got a horrible graphic installer. I mean, it's disastrously bad compared to a bunch of server
2832960	2838720	A bunch of server install is so stinking slick. I just don't have words for how good it is
2838800	2842400	And I have been using that my whole life. I mean recently and so then I go
2842480	2845600	So then I try to do red hat and red hat just falls on its face
2846080	2850800	It can't do certain things. It doesn't have this other thing. It doesn't have this other thing and
2851520	2856000	Uh, no, I installed rocky linux not red has enterprise linux. Do they have a different installer?
2857120	2859120	If they have it if there's a different installer
2859520	2861520	With then I will have to eat my hat
2861760	2866560	And go do red hat enterprise linux installer instead of rocky linux installer. Either way
2867200	2869440	Uh, the issue that I hit after that
2870160	2872480	Uh, still applies. So
2873280	2876480	We hit an issue and I actually wrote about this in my zettelcast and you go read it
2877440	2878720	where
2878720	2882160	Um, I found a forum on red hat that said
2882960	2886400	Do all of these things if you want to get your mac mini to work
2887280	2890560	With red hat with red hat networking stuff and it was, you know, totally doable
2890640	2895360	It was just quite a bit of stuff and I have like 19 of these things that I have to set up
2895760	2898320	And I was going to have to go through all of these individual steps for all of them
2899040	2901280	And you know red hat tries to have a smart install
2901280	2907760	But it really sucks compared to cloud in it and stuff like it in in canonical and you know in in ubuntu
2907920	2912880	It's not even the same. In fact ubuntu could be cited as the the standard for
2913920	2915920	cloud-based, you know
2916000	2920560	operating system initialization cloud in it is by far the industry standard for that and
2921280	2925840	So anyway, so red has got this other answer and in the forum thread
2926800	2931520	Somebody says well, this is on a mac and the the the person officially representing red hat
2932080	2934560	Basically threw him under the bus and said
2935280	2938640	Oh, well, that's mac hardware. We don't we don't ever test on anything on mac
2939600	2946000	And and the reason that that offends a guy like me who was alive and owned red hat stock in 2000
2946960	2948560	2001
2948560	2951600	And eventually sold it when they did the whole fedora thing is because back then
2952320	2958400	Red hat promised the world that they were just as much a member of the overall linux community as everybody else
2959200	2964400	That they were going to maintain that love and support for linux on all hardware, you know
2964480	2972480	And that we were going to continue with the mission of empowering old hardware with new linux distro installations and
2973200	2977680	Recycling, you know old computers, which is all I mean that this is the core values
2978240	2982320	Of linux if you're in the linux community, those are our core values
2982720	2988000	That we we have choice we get to say what we want to do we can we can make it so that it runs on any hardware
2988400	2992480	And to be fair red hat still does run it just takes all this extra work
2992720	2997520	And so for red hat official people to say we really don't care about you if you're running on mac
2997920	3004240	Is basically just them confirming what everybody has known all along would end up happening in 2022
3004400	3010080	The only thing they care about is enterprise period. It's in the name red hat enterprise linux
3010400	3016080	There's no such thing as anything but enterprise them because people don't run mac minis in the enterprise because that would be silly
3016400	3018400	There's actually a lot of people who do
3018400	3021760	They're fantastic home lab machines, by the way, they're much more powerful than a raspberry pi
3021920	3026960	They have better hardware and they're cheaper than a lot of mainframe, you know other big systems
3027200	3031120	And if you're not going to do virtualization and you want an actual hardware instance, they're actually pretty good for that
3031680	3035200	So, you know as long as they have intel chips in them and they have one thing is a whole different question
3035200	3036560	We don't even go there
3036560	3039840	So but you know, there's no plan for them to support it
3039840	3044400	But but the the arrogance of them to just say oh, we don't care about mac people
3045040	3047120	That just really upset me and frankly
3047840	3050960	You know, if I am an enterprise cto, I'm not going to care about that either
3050960	3055120	I'm like, no, I'm really happy that you're spending all of your money and time and energy
3055520	3059360	Supporting my hardware. Why would you even dream of wasting your energy?
3059520	3064480	You know making sure to test your distribution on any mac hardware at all. That's a waste of your time
3065200	3067360	And if I'm an enterprise cto, I agree with that
3068080	3070800	But I'm not an enterprise cto. I'm a guy running a home lab
3071440	3073040	and I'm I'm
3073040	3078480	Taking all of the hardware that I have and there is a company that has values that are consistent with that
3078880	3085440	And that's canonical. You can you can throw them under the bus all you want, but the name ubuntu means what does it mean?
3086640	3088640	What does ubuntu mean?
3090800	3093440	And if I don't we're in short ubuntu has a few meanings when used as a
3093920	3099920	As a naguni bantu term ubuntu means humanity. However, it is sometimes translated as I am because we are
3100240	3105600	So the diagram of ubuntu is, you know, the logo is like all these arms and arm and arm
3106160	3112320	And you know canonical has done some weird things. They are a company as well, but the company values have never changed
3112880	3117600	I mean, they're just as relevant in the enterprise microkates and all the stuff that they're doing
3118160	3121440	Uh, and and they're doing, you know, like really really amazing things
3122240	3127680	And so they're you know, I haven't seen about red hat red has become the apple of linux
3128400	3130900	red hat really has become the apple of linux
3132640	3134240	They
3134240	3136800	They want to say that they're doing free stuff. They really don't care
3136880	3140000	They're just catering to the enterprise and they just need to come clean and own it
3140720	3144320	Um, and then everybody else can make that decision if you want to be relevant in the enterprise
3144560	3148640	But I tell you what there's a lot of enterprises that are picking that are avoiding red hat
3149280	3155040	And so the reason and I actually don't like open shift for all the same reasons red hat and open shift
3155280	3157760	Have done everything in their power to lock you in
3158400	3160400	to their product
3160400	3162480	and um
3162480	3164480	so
3164560	3168320	No, it's not like 10. No, I don't know. So the um
3169680	3171600	So the the problem the problem we have
3172320	3175760	Is that we have an enterprise operating like an enterprise
3176400	3177360	with
3177360	3183040	all of its priorities which are to lock you in and create systems that you depend on completely
3183600	3186880	And they've very openly but they've been very open about doing that and they
3187360	3189360	They're trying to do that and for I don't want that
3190080	3196080	I don't want that a bottom line. I I want open standards and red hat can tell you all they want about open standards
3196160	3198160	But as long as they control the standard
3198400	3202400	And and they have been doing that. I mean and they've done some good things. I mean bilda was great
3202880	3207840	It took red hat to kind of go at it proprietary wise with docker. Docker was also one of these companies
3207840	3212000	I want to lock you in they just proved it by forcing everybody to pay for their enterprise product
3212240	3213520	Docker desktop
3213520	3217760	So they've always been a company and they haven't really given a crap about free and open source software at all
3218000	3220000	At the end of the day, they're a company and they need to make money
3220720	3224160	And there's people there's people in the company who like to believe that they
3224640	3227760	Have the the needs of the open source community at heart
3228000	3230320	But then when they force everybody who's already got
3230640	3233920	desktop linux on their enterprise systems to pay money because it's a big
3234240	3236240	You know behemoth enterprises got the money
3236640	3240800	Then you see their true colors show and they there's nothing wrong with them making money
3240800	3245520	They're actually legally bound to make money. That's part of what being an s-corp or a c-corp is
3246160	3247200	But
3247200	3251200	They just need to own that they are no longer free and open source. They really don't care
3251920	3253920	They care about making money and so
3254480	3257200	I know i'm going kind of off the off the edge here, but
3258560	3262000	People know that i've been kind of in the middle of the road when it comes to like
3262640	3268240	corporate enterprisey conservative kind of you know, you know values and ethos and you know
3268560	3275600	Really really off the deep end fsf kind of like if you're not using gpl v3, you're the devil and should be cancelled
3276320	3278720	You know, and i'm kind of in the middle there
3279840	3285200	But this whole experience with my lab has kind of shifted me back towards the fsf side
3285600	3290160	Not quite i'm more like torval torval's is kind of dead center in the middle of it
3290720	3297360	Uh, you know, he understands the needs of corporations and thinks you gpl v3 is the devil and I agree, but but
3298080	3300400	You know, he would not go so far as to say
3300880	3303040	Everybody should put red hat on all their computers
3303760	3307760	You know, he stays out of that fight completely mostly by focusing on the kernel architectures and stuff
3308320	3313360	So that's a pretty long rant, but I I feel like I owe it to everybody
3313680	3315680	Let's see if we can change the tone up a little bit though
3316320	3319760	Uh, the open nature of linux and proliferation of distros saves us a lot. I I agree
3320560	3324720	And you know and and somebody let me let me show you another symptom of this, okay
3325040	3330720	So somebody said to me today, uh lbg, I think it was, you know, who's fond of reminding me of stuff that I forget
3330800	3332400	Which is always good
3332400	3335200	They said, well, we would be nowhere in the container space
3335920	3337920	Uh, if it weren't for red hat
3338640	3343440	And and and lbg told me about this site github.com slash containers
3344160	3348000	Do you see any indication on this site that this site is red hat the company?
3349520	3351520	There's none
3351680	3357680	You have to like dig. There's no official statement that this that this website is from red hat
3358000	3362320	Why doesn't red hat put red hat in their github container and their github name?
3364080	3366080	Because they know
3366080	3371520	That's what I think I think it's because they know they know if they were to put github.com slash red hat and nobody would open it
3374000	3375840	And so yeah, I have a look at nix's pretty cool
3376560	3381120	So so no so they they went to github.com containers. There is no way for you to know
3381840	3384880	And and let's see you and they started as soon as you start looking at the technology list
3384880	3391040	You're like realizing hmm pod man. Oh build a scopio. What the hell? This is red hat
3392560	3394000	Right
3394000	3396480	And then you start to realize and then you start to look at the names here
3396480	3398720	You get there's a guy with a red hat. Just hope he was awesome
3399280	3402480	I mean look as I said the people at red hat are awesome the company
3405680	3409840	Right so just said he's really awesome software engineer at red hat
3410160	3413120	You know and the rest of them they're not going to tell you where they work
3413200	3416240	I mean, you know who they were if you know you know names so you can look at them
3416800	3419840	So so this this is a good. This is a good example of red hat
3420320	3427120	Trying to hide the fact that they're red hat because they don't want to be associated with all the things red hat has become associated with
3427920	3430880	And and that includes filming their nose at
3431520	3436240	Anything that they don't like or any any of the the other part of the linux distribution
3436240	3440640	They the red hat is one of the worst linux citizens. They are the apple of linux
3441440	3446240	They and as far as I'm concerned. I don't want anything to do with red hat ever again
3446880	3451600	Uh in terms of a distribution and as a company I I will still use their their
3452240	3454240	Contributions because I have to
3454240	3456240	I can't avoid them
3456480	3459200	Because I don't you know, I don't have a say they don't care what I say
3459760	3463680	They you know so build a pod man and things and they'll continue to make stuff that
3464320	3469280	You know is used out there and I still think that there's stuff that you just like apple. I use apple products, right?
3470000	3472000	But I hate apple
3472240	3475680	I know I it's hard not being a hypocrite. I mean, how are you going to get work done if you don't use it?
3476960	3480400	So it's like, you know, it doesn't mean I have to like it, right?
3481280	3482960	so um
3482960	3489280	Anyway, uh speaking of things I I come to not like recently. I know this is a very ranty night
3489920	3494720	Today, but I I I feel like I I mean I wasted a lot of time this weekend on stuff that I wish I hadn't
3495360	3498240	Uh, and I wish I had thought through a little bit better
3498880	3501520	Uh, so open shift is as everybody knows is kubernetes
3502320	3504320	Is red hats variation on kubernetes?
3504800	3509760	Uh, it has some very good things in it. It it it to be completely honest though
3510320	3516320	The biggest difference between red hat and canonical is red hat over engineers everything
3517280	3524560	And they're brilliant the red hand engineers are brilliant and they over engineer shit and they don't make it usable
3525040	3528480	It's it's one of their regular problems and canonical
3529120	3534320	Is really really good at simplifying and thinking about usability
3534880	3541120	But they sometimes lack the engineering expertise that red hat has and what would be really great is that we could get the middle of that
3541360	3547760	You know, I just wish that they had done that they had done that I wish and and canonical's got great engineers
3547760	3553280	I'm gonna be wrong but but the the reason that I want to promote canonical and ebuntu is because
3553760	3555760	Their products have always been
3556560	3561520	You I mean to a fault. I mean snap comes to mind, right? Uh, have always been
3562160	3565440	Like focused on usability above everything else
3566160	3575040	Uh, if they over it I I happen to think that over engineering is a sign of a somebody you don't want to work with
3576160	3577680	but that's
3577680	3580880	There's there are people there are people there are engineers in this world
3580880	3584320	And you know if you've been around for any amount of time there are engineers in this world
3584480	3589920	Who think that the most over engineered complex solution is the best one because only smart people understand it
3590640	3592640	And I cannot overstate
3593040	3599600	How stupid that is and how that person those type of engineers should be weeded out and fired immediately
3600240	3607840	The it is so complicated that the most brilliant people are the ones you can take a highly complex system
3608320	3611440	And turn it into something that can be some simplicity
3612080	3614560	Uh, uh lock ins are depressing
3614960	3619760	My my we have a comment here. My actual and first job is pushing me towards learning open shift on top of already existing
3619760	3623600	I've been products the lock ins are depressing. They are they're depressing and so look
3623920	3626880	I had a choice in my home lab and in my personal life
3627600	3632320	Uh to say look, I I do not need or want to learn red hat
3632960	3636160	And and I don't want to stay current. I mean the argument for me to put it on there was hey
3636160	3638720	I'm going to stay current. I'll be able to get a good job. I get my r.h.c. You know
3638960	3641040	I'll be good to go if I want to be an infrastructure engineer
3641280	3643600	And if you if you want to be an infrastructure engineer today
3643600	3648640	I'm very sad to report that you cannot be one if you don't know red hat
3649040	3650320	You have to know it
3650320	3653840	But there is a certain percentage of jobs out there that people are hiring
3654080	3657920	Hiring either container-based or dev ops or cloud native and there are some
3658560	3663600	Big shops. I imagine I haven't seen any that actually use a bunch of server and I have a choice
3664400	3667200	And my choice is to prepare for those jobs
3667440	3673440	Even if that job is way way way harder for me to find and this goes for rusted go and I don't I just to compare it
3673440	3678720	I you know, I had I once advised somebody who ended up getting a job in influx db doing go programming
3678720	3680400	Get well some new rust
3680400	3682560	Uh, I I told him point blank. I said, you know
3683280	3686880	It you go for it. Go for it. Go. I you guys won't believe this about me
3686880	3693120	But I actually encourage this guy to go find a rust job. I said, look, you you know, it's gonna you're gonna have to sacrifice
3693120	3695600	You might have to move to germany. There's lots of like rust jobs in germany
3696160	3697120	um
3697120	3702320	But you know if if that's your real passion then you're gonna have to make a sacrifice and find a company that has it
3702320	3705920	And he came in one day on his own to me without me saying anything
3706400	3708400	He says I'm starting to think that I should learn go
3708880	3713200	So I can get the job and then I can just have rust and do that on the side until it gets big
3713280	3715840	And he got six how he got the job. That's exactly how he got the job
3716480	3721280	Because in all of influx db isn't go except for flux the flux language, which is in rust
3721520	3723520	They ended up getting a job working on that
3723760	3725760	The point is that
3726160	3728160	You don't have to pick
3728880	3732080	Uh, the mainstream stuff esxi. I mean
3732320	3734640	You know, you don't have to pick those things
3735200	3737200	Uh, I'm gotten older
3737280	3743120	So I my picks are largely in line and training you as largely in line with what's going to get you an immediate job
3743760	3746560	But sometimes especially like right now
3747520	3749520	You know, you have the choice to say
3749600	3753440	You know, I don't need to give in on that for example
3753840	3758320	If I want to use Linux on the desktop if you want to lose Linux on the desktop and you don't want to work anywhere
3758320	3759760	That doesn't let you do that
3759760	3763520	You can filter out 80 of the companies out there and you can say look
3763520	3768560	I don't want to work for any company that is too stupid to not let me use Linux on my desktop
3769120	3772400	And I used to I used to joke with my old manager. He's gone now. He left you retired
3772640	3774240	But I used to joke with him after he hired me
3774240	3776400	I was like, you know, if I had asked that one question
3776400	3779360	I would never have taken this job because they forced me to use a macro windows
3780160	3782880	And I after being using Linux on the desktop for 12 years
3783520	3786640	And I adapted and I'm using vmware now and everything but
3787120	3789520	But seriously if you're interviewing
3790080	3794160	You can choose I guess that's the point I'm making you can choose to say
3795280	3796480	No
3796480	3800080	And you can there's never been a time when you could be more picky, especially if you're good
3800880	3806320	You can say look, I I don't you know, no, you're gonna make me you're gonna make me use windows every day. Goodbye
3806720	3809200	There's like, you know, 10 other people down the street that will hire me
3810400	3814480	I mean, but you have to make your own decisions if you want to make your
3814960	3816960	Chances for working in a place
3817040	3820560	A lot of jesson qualifiers, you know, they use it on the server, of course
3821120	3824560	Uh, and you know, but but you can you can do the same thing you can make a choice
3824560	3828320	You can say I don't work want to work for any company that uses red hat servers
3829840	3831840	Right, you can do that
3832720	3839120	That's a very very very tiny list of companies that you'll work for and you'll be eliminating most of the fortune 500
3840240	3841920	Uh, but
3841920	3844880	You can do it. You can do that. You know, it's your choice
3845520	3848000	Uh, you could you could say, you know, whatever so
3849280	3851280	that you anyway, um
3852640	3858320	Uh, that that's kind of uh, that topic. Let me let me see if I can save some of these
3858400	3862960	I mean, we do we were a little bit late. So I'll try to to bump bump through the rest of these questions really quickly
3863600	3865600	A desktop too. Yeah
3865840	3867760	Uh, why did I bend a proxmox? So
3868640	3872560	People have been watching me do my uh, home lab and it stuff
3873360	3874480	and
3874480	3875280	uh
3875280	3876800	proxmox
3876800	3881200	I I did not know this when I got into it. I really wish I had I wrote a lot about it in my zed if you want to read it
3881840	3886560	Uh, the the short answer is uh proxmox maximum that maximum nodes in a cluster is 32
3887200	3893520	Uh, I got the 14 nodes in my cluster and proxmox started falling on its face in ways that I won't go into detail on
3894240	3897360	Uh, it just could not the coral sink could not keep everything updated
3897760	3901520	Uh, I had caching problems because the icons were not getting refreshed properly
3901840	3908320	And all the problems I was having were confirmed by tons and tons of forum posts on proxmox from the people having the same problem
3908800	3909680	and
3909680	3911520	uh, everybody
3911520	3912400	Um
3912400	3919280	That I ask who says proxmox works great for them. It has like less than five nodes usually just one node and and they use it
3919280	3926000	So, uh, I mean I was already kind of leery of the whole afero gpl v3 license that proxmox was released under
3926480	3928960	Uh, and the whole use of you know dependency on a web interface
3929600	3931840	I mean, I did like it. It was it was super pretty
3932320	3934800	Uh, but it's definitely not necessary. And so
3935600	3938640	After I hit those problems, I was like now proxmox is out of here
3939200	3945280	And and then another another problem too is that I noticed that all of my four gigabyte mac minis gave up
3945280	3948640	1.2 gigabytes of ram just to running the proxmox
3949120	3951120	uh agent
3951600	3953200	That's true story
3953200	3955200	Just to run the proxmox agent
3955200	3959040	Which which is I mean to run the base the base, you know virtual machine
3959600	3962800	And then the proxmox agent on top of that took up 1.2 gigabytes of ram
3962960	3966000	So I had about three gigabytes of ram left to do anything with really anyway
3966400	3969360	I haven't done a comparison with uh a bunch of server
3970000	3973120	I went ahead and put the full version of service to the minified version
3973840	3977840	On my nodes at this point and I went ahead and reinstalled and put that on 19 different things
3977840	3979840	So I'm going to be running a bunch of server on everything
3980400	3984640	um, and then I'm going to be running kvm and live vert and vert manager from
3985280	3989760	Uh, my main server directly and then also the vnc and stuff like that from it
3990400	3992720	I don't really need anything to do that management
3993360	3996960	I'm looking at like ansible to kind of help with that but after looking at it
3997360	4002080	How problematic ansible is with the whole python thing? I'm actually thinking about making my own
4002480	4004480	single binary agent
4004560	4006800	That's compiled with bonsai that runs on the endpoints
4007520	4010080	That does essentially what I did when I was at IBM and I wrote
4010640	4013040	I wrote an entire infrastructure framework
4013760	4016720	for audit compliance and security for 52 000 machines
4016800	4021200	I'm thinking about doing the same sort of thing and go just as a fun project. It's a home lab
4021280	4025760	That's what they're for and I absolutely hate all the solutions that are out there right now
4026080	4031760	Because they require python virtual environments and they they over step in what they do to the
4032080	4037440	Virtual machines and and if you still are running on on iron and you don't want to run under vm because you're going to take a
4037520	4040480	30% loss through your containers. That's another stat. I found
4040960	4045040	I switched to kvm vert box from virtual virtual box. Did you really cool?
4045760	4051840	And I I mean, I really think kvm is the way to go. I kvm is the basis for all major cloud providers now
4052320	4054800	Uh, and it's it's going to be the future
4055440	4058720	And so anything that I can do that plays in the kvm space
4059280	4062560	Uh, it's going to be more relevant long term and it's also fun
4063200	4067760	So I am going to be writing. I'm looking at salt right now, but that's also python and I was like, eh
4068400	4074720	So I may be stealing some of the best ideas of these configuration management systems and creating one and go if one doesn't already exist
4074800	4078240	and doing that I might actually resurrect fluff, which is um
4079040	4083600	Was what I started some time ago to do this very thing to provision
4084560	4088160	You know vm's really quickly and based on profiles and things like that
4088400	4092880	But to do it on a local machine using, you know, your local installation of vmware
4093440	4095120	Uh, I started out with virtual box
4095120	4098400	We had three providers and they would do it locally if you had enough, you know prox
4098800	4103680	But I think we could come back to the to the fluff thing and maybe come up with some sort of distributed thing as well
4103840	4108800	And now we're like controlling things remotely as well. So, uh, if we do that, that'll be a bonsai branch
4108880	4112160	It'll be fluff as a bonsai branch and then we'll be able to put that in your monolith
4113120	4114880	And your bonsai is your monolith or whatever you want to do
4114880	4118560	So that's that's all development that I plan to do over, you know
4118640	4122080	When this whether gets colder and stuff and after I get my lab set up
4122480	4127520	So if you want to watch any of that happening, it's going to be going for a while. Yes, it is a not invented here thing
4127600	4134640	I'm making a mountain what I really don't understand is why there's not a better product in this space. That's a single binary
4135200	4137200	Uh, the closest thing to it is terraform
4138080	4144160	Which is just orchestration. I mean you can bend it's arm and make it do configuration management, but it's not designed for that
4144720	4151600	Um, and there's no combination of configuration orchestration and and stuff like fabric which just runs remote
4152160	4155120	Uh, you know, just run this one thing remote and give you back the results
4155600	4158160	And I I I don't know why, um
4158880	4162400	And I I feel like there's some area for innovation on that front
4163200	4166880	Uh, what's the font? This is group. This is uh, ubuntu mono
4167840	4170720	Yeah, it just looks good because I I adopted the group box
4171520	4174000	So and and I run it at a pretty high
4174800	4177440	Uh size so that you can read it from wherever
4178160	4182960	Uh, what is your font about that? We under that. Um
4184080	4188480	So the question should you should you try to run Linux on max of apples actually trying to keep it from happening?
4189120	4190880	Uh
4190880	4192880	The answer to this is
4193200	4195200	Yes in your home lab
4195680	4196800	So
4196800	4202560	There's kind of two contexts for when you make a decision about what you want to run Linux on if you're
4203200	4205200	picking hardware for
4206000	4208000	any size organization
4208240	4210480	Obviously, you're not going to buy max for that
4211520	4212880	but
4212880	4219520	If you are working for a school or somebody that has a bunch of old lab hardware
4220160	4226320	Mac minis like mine or other old hardware and you don't have the budget to
4227440	4230880	You know use the cloud or even have a good internet connection for god's sakes
4231920	4236960	There are max errors. Yeah, but yeah, um, we were talking so
4238080	4241760	Uh, yeah, they're 10 and they were on aix. Do you remember the 90s?
4242400	4245760	In the 90s. Yeah, the power PCs. They're on aix. This is IBM tech
4246880	4248880	So anyway, um
4249120	4254640	Yeah, I can tell that people are not as interested. I have to say anymore that the viewers are dropping a little bit
4255280	4260960	Uh, that's fine. I don't care. So you should try to run Linux on max. I I do think
4262080	4263280	That if you
4263280	4266080	Have an old mac and you want to breathe life into it again
4266800	4271920	Because especially if it's been written off by apple who said we're not supporting that anymore
4272560	4273680	Goodbye
4273680	4277600	And and it has intel hardware, which is a lot of old intel and I said, yeah, hell, yeah
4279120	4282720	Uh osx server. Yeah, the cheese grader mac pro
4284560	4286560	And it has osx. Yes
4287040	4290800	Uh, it's yeah, it does. Well, yeah, I mean they're
4291760	4295280	Yes, the answer is yes. I I think you should run Linux on anything and everything
4297120	4302080	And I have made a great hobby and passion of mine to do that. There was a time when I couldn't drop
4303440	4307760	Five grand on a server and make, you know, the sweet corporate money now
4308480	4312800	But there was a time when I was we're starting out and there's a lot of you out there watching right now who don't have that kind of
4312800	4313840	money
4313840	4315840	and you are
4316080	4321680	You know at best in a in a dorm or you're trying to get it to run and you're trying to dual boot your mid laptops and stuff, right
4322880	4326560	and to someone like that just having a server
4327520	4332160	Of any kind having a separate computer to run Linux on is and use it as a server and leave it plugged into the wall
4332640	4334640	it's a big deal
4334800	4335760	and
4335760	4341600	For many people they will find old hard. I had one guy who was the son of the director of tech for david's college
4341600	4345200	And he had like thousands of dollars and left over hardware. It made me so sick
4345760	4347760	but he just got so
4347760	4348640	you know
4348640	4350160	Linux
4350160	4352160	Linux is
4352160	4354880	I mean one part of the core ethos of Linux is
4355520	4359040	Breathing new life into old hardware no matter what
4361040	4363600	And you'd be surprised what people can put Linux on it's amazing
4364560	4366560	Uh
4367760	4373360	To be mean to viewers. Yeah, I can't be pretty mean so anyway, um
4375120	4377760	So what I'm trying to say is that um
4379200	4380400	Is that
4380400	4384640	You should you should try to run on anything and don't let people put you down
4384880	4386880	If you're running it on like a p2
4387440	4392080	Or you know some really ancient hardware because you know what you'd be surprised. This is another thing about Linux
4392160	4394160	I never get tired
4395040	4395920	of
4395920	4398880	Dealing particularly when I was mentoring people directly one-on-one in person
4398960	4399920	I don't get this
4399920	4404240	I don't get this buzz as much as I used to because I don't deal with people and it's really annoying actually
4404960	4409280	One of my I didn't get paid much when I ran my own company because I lower the rate really low
4409360	4411280	So I can do the bare minimum
4411280	4416800	And so one of the things that was valuable to me was being in person with somebody when they're learning this stuff
4416960	4418960	All of the aha moments. Oh
4419200	4420960	Oh
4420960	4425760	I used to be present when they would have these moments and they were worth like a hundred dollars each to me
4426960	4428800	They still are
4428800	4430080	I miss it
4430080	4434320	This is why I want to I want y'all to stream so I can get you know paid
4435040	4437040	through watching you discover stuff
4437120	4438320	because because
4438320	4439680	Seriously, so
4439680	4442160	One of those times there there is nothing better that okay
4442160	4447840	So one guy actually brought in is another story one guy brought in I told him I said look if you look it goes
4447840	4450400	I don't have a computer. I don't know where to go. I said I promise you
4450880	4454000	Next time you're at a family gathering if you ask your family members
4454000	4460400	If anybody has an old computer in the closet or the attic someplace that they're keeping because it's got old tax records on it
4461840	4465520	Right, it's got old tax records on it and they're too afraid to give it to goodwill
4466160	4470480	And I guarantee you there are tons of them if you go find those things and they say well, we don't want to give
4470480	4474000	It's got tax records. Okay. Well or browser histories or something like that, right?
4474640	4476560	You could you can go find it you will find one
4476560	4480640	I promise you and you promise them that you will wipe that disc clean and that you will make it better
4480640	4482640	and that you will put it to good use
4483360	4486320	And I you would not believe how many free computers people can find
4486880	4491120	In fact, it was such a thing. It was such a thing that we would actually start
4491840	4493840	going through
4494080	4498480	Neighborhoods we started putting together an affidavit that we could get legally signed and presented people so we could say
4498480	4501040	Look, we are officially this is our official position on this. We're not begging
4501440	4504640	We are taking your old computers cleaning them up and and
4505520	4511200	Renewing them and giving them to people who don't have computers so that we can close the digital divide in our own country
4513360	4520400	That is my primary goal with linux and if it if and if a company like red hat says we don't care what our
4520480	4525040	Distro runs on do you see how offensive that gets to me because that's like red hat saying
4526400	4528400	We really don't want to be a part of that
4528960	4535120	We just want to cater to the enterprise. We don't care about all the linux efforts that are going on all over the world
4535760	4542560	Uh to put computers and technology in the hands of people who don't have it to take old hardware and breathe new life in it
4542720	4546400	Because the most pleasurable aha moment that you will ever hear
4547040	4551520	Is somebody booting an old computer into windows 98 and I kid you not
4552560	4556160	Looking it around at all the old netscape navigator stuff on everything
4556960	4562240	And installing linux and watching it just cook as a server watching it run
4562880	4568960	Fine as a server watching it be a hundred percent performant as a server because it's way more powerful than any the even a raspberry pi 4
4570160	4572160	Even though it's like 10 year old computer
4573280	4576400	So instead of going to the trash heap or to someplace else
4576960	4578960	This computer becomes
4579040	4584880	A new toy and it's now in the corner of the garage or it's plugged in it's like really a slow ethernet
4586160	4587840	You know
4587840	4592560	And there's that so to me that's when you when you ask whether you should run an apple
4592640	4597280	I think you should run on anything and I think the first time that you show somebody
4597360	4600240	I mean look if you take away all that ugly gooey
4601440	4607360	Right you're using a 10 year old computer right now exactly you take away all that ugly gooey stuff and you learn to use the terminal
4608480	4613040	You would be blown away and you can run like the fish at max settings
4616240	4618240	You know
4618640	4624560	And if you're using vi you're not going to get any lag at all because it's vi vi's rate is supposed to work on 300 bond
4625760	4628080	So, you know all of these things
4629120	4631120	make using
4631520	4634080	You know computers really fun again
4634240	4639920	In fact, if there's one reason to try linux is it makes computing fun again
4640240	4643520	Using linux makes computers fun to the right person
4643520	4647440	Not everybody wants to use the terminal and see what they can do with all these important
4647840	4650240	These kind of people by the way are the kind of people that will like
4650480	4656560	You know like get a pair of wire cutters and strip down old serial cables and like cause them to control other electronics and shit like that
4657280	4659920	And maybe they never did it before but they just want to experiment with that
4660080	4663360	That's the kind of person that gets really into this kind of stuff
4664080	4668880	Uh working with linux and open stack all day. Oh, you'll have to talk to us about open stack. I actually want to
4669600	4671600	Uh open stack is all python unfortunately
4672400	4674800	Uh, but I am thinking about learning open stack
4675520	4679280	Uh, because I think open stack would be better than something like proxmox for even a home lab
4680240	4683760	Uh, and by the way open stack, there's lots and lots of work in open stack
4684480	4689040	Yeah, if you learn open stack, that's something that's an open source very very open source technology that is
4689760	4693520	Um, but apparently they they're really really really bigoted about python
4694480	4702480	Yeah, tony far reported that that he tried to commit some uh, some add some projects and go to the projects
4702480	4704480	And they were denied because they weren't go
4704720	4708000	And when I heard that I was like, oh, I don't know man
4709280	4714240	I mean they're that into python, you know, they don't want to even consider other languages
4714320	4718000	So I they're we're kind of on the cusp of a lot of other stuff
4718640	4720640	Hey, how's it going south korea?
4721040	4724080	Love having you. I love south korea. I cannot wait to go one day
4724720	4726720	I want to go to south korea so bad it hurts
4727600	4731360	Uh, pythonic is in nature. Yes, that's right. Yeah
4732400	4734400	so
4734400	4736400	Who bought all the pies?
4738000	4741760	Uh, I have a few what did I change my title? Please tell me I did
4742640	4744640	Okay, good. I guess I guess I didn't
4745760	4748400	I thought I did I did that same thing I did before again
4750720	4754800	Uh, I thought I changed the title. I didn't all right. Well, let's let's wrap up the stream here
4755360	4756400	Singapore
4756400	4757600	fantastic
4757600	4761040	Oh, I love rancher desktop rancher, but it's got a problem
4762080	4763600	um
4763600	4767600	What is the data lake? I have no idea. What is a data lake?
4768560	4770560	I am a nerd we talked about that already
4771120	4772800	Yeah
4772800	4777760	You go back and watch the watch the youtube video when I post it if you wanted a data lake is a centralized repository
4777760	4780000	That allows you to store all your structure on structure data at scale
4780640	4782960	You can store your data as is having to first structure the data
4783920	4785600	Yeah
4785600	4791280	I'm not a I'm not a fan of data lakes. Uh, you got it fair. I've been a relational database person my whole life
4791840	4795520	Uh, if you look at like mongo db and a bunch of people that have tried to do object databases
4795600	4800320	And you you see them fall on their face and end up, uh, deploying a relational database later
4800880	4805360	Uh, you'll see the problem. I think you should start with relational relational database up front
4806080	4810880	Uh, if you need a database if you don't need a database, you might be fine with just files actually
4811440	4813520	Uh, I know that's heresy to say it, but um
4814800	4817200	Yeah, I but I'm not I'm not a fan of that
4817920	4819920	Uh, so yeah
4820320	4822160	Corporate yes
4822160	4828560	What do I think of web 3? I hate it. Uh, web 3 is disastrously poorly designed. Uh, it's horribly over engineered
4829280	4833280	By extremely intelligent people who have no practical sense whatsoever
4834240	4839840	And these are my worst type of technologists if I detect that type of technologist
4840480	4845440	In real life, whether I'm working with them or I see them at a conference or at a pub
4845760	4850640	I will do everything in my power to get out of the room and go somewhere far away from them
4852160	4854880	Because yeah, SQLite exactly so
4855840	4857440	um
4857440	4861280	People who don't understand why web 3 is a bad idea
4862240	4867520	Uh, are not thinking in practical terms. I I absolutely despise
4868640	4870640	Engineers who are not practical
4871440	4877600	Who do things because they can who like to pick technology because it's cool and because it's complex
4878160	4880960	I despise technology for technology's sake
4881680	4882960	um
4882960	4886800	Yeah, I'll go swing in a hammock. I will this I
4887520	4893600	Technology is serves one purpose of one purpose only and that is to enable life to
4894240	4895520	be better
4895520	4897520	and to go on and to
4897600	4904720	You know and create harmony in the universe and and all of those things and any technology that just tracks from that
4905840	4909760	Uh, especially if it's claiming to do that and it fails to hypocritically
4910480	4912640	Uh, I don't want nothing to do with it and that's web 3
4913520	4916320	As web 3 that's NFTs. That's any of the crypto stuff
4917040	4923600	Uh, am I opposed to people exploring the realm and see if it's a good way to secure exchanges between banks and stuff?
4924000	4926000	possibly, uh
4926080	4928080	I I'm just I'm just tired of
4929120	4930400	of
4930400	4938240	Impractical people applying their extremely intelligent brains to things and coming up with shit that makes no sense at all
4939040	4941760	Uh, and by the way html was a bad idea myself, too
4941760	4946080	I think html was a bad idea and to a lesser degree html was exactly this problem
4946880	4949360	Markdown was plenty fine
4951280	4954400	Why didn't they use it markdown was invented by writers
4955360	4959920	Who wanted something practical html was invented by scientists
4961840	4965360	So they immediately went to the other scientists and they said hey scientists
4966080	4969440	Uh, what are you already using for like managing like data and stuff?
4969440	4975120	We're using this sgml thing with some big ass acronym that doesn't make any sense to anybody and make some sound really important
4976720	4981360	No markdown did not exist if it had in fact the knowledge exchange grid that I want to make
4982160	4985120	Is markdown and Hugo's markdown, right?
4986000	4988000	Yeah, Hugo's Hugo's a go tech
4988160	4989280	so
4989280	4992560	Markdown is relatively, you know, uh, by the way erin schwarz
4993360	4998720	Uh, and uh, John Gruber made markdown John Gruber still has
4999760	5003280	Uh, I think John Gruber has been he's so much of a writer and a podcaster
5003600	5007120	They asked him a jgm who made pandog invited him
5007840	5011040	to be in a you know involved and he's like nah
5013600	5016320	And so jgms lost was like trying to document mark out good
5016800	5022080	If you go read the itf rfc's on markdown, it's hilarious because there's no official markdown
5022560	5026240	Specification at all and so they tried to come up with one and jgm was left
5026720	5031840	This berkeley guy was left to come up with you know as close as he could come up with with a standard because markdown as
5032320	5036640	Defined in the pearl script that jong made that erin helped him make by the way erin schwarz
5037200	5039200	God knows he's one of my favorite humans who ever live
5039840	5040960	um
5040960	5044000	You know they they it's got tons of bugs and
5044560	5049360	Inconsistency is a specification of jgm and very scientifically. He's like he's a philosophy professor berkeley
5049600	5051680	He's like okay. We got to fix this so he gets in there
5051920	5056720	And he tries to fix it all and he comes up with as much consensus as he can for common mark
5057120	5060480	And he got github to sit at the table and reddit and a couple other people
5060960	5066000	And they come out with the common mark standard which you know and get a flavor markdown as an extension of it now
5066080	5068080	And so that's all been standardized
5069200	5070240	But
5070240	5073600	You know so look there does need to be a scientific approach to it
5073680	5079920	But I I tell you that story because it's a perfect example of engineers screwing shit up
5080160	5081920	They do it all the time
5081920	5083200	engineers
5083200	5084960	fix problems
5084960	5088400	But they also create problems out of thin air
5089600	5091600	Because they're engineers
5093440	5097120	And I know because I've done it i've done it i've done it so many times
5097440	5100800	Raise your hand if you've done it raise your hand if you've over engineered a solution
5101280	5105280	And and you're like you come you go get some coffee you come back and you're like and you look at it you're like
5106320	5111600	You mean I could oh my god or or here's a here's a better one. Here's a better one your wife, right?
5111920	5116960	You're like you're like you're like going for a walk and you don't have a twitch stream to torment with all of your ideas, right?
5119040	5121360	Yeah, and you're like and you're and you're talking to your you know you're talking
5122000	5124400	You're like tormenting your wife with like technical knowledge, right?
5124400	5127120	It's just trying really hard because she loves you to understand what you're saying
5128080	5131360	And she's trying to follow you because she loves you and you try to follow her art stuff and everything
5131680	5134480	And and out of nowhere. She says well, what if you did this?
5134960	5137120	I mean, I mean she's like, you know, I'm not a techie or anything
5137120	5141200	But what if I just what if you just did that instead and you're like, oh my god
5142080	5144080	You're a genius
5147600	5148880	Oh
5148880	5150880	Yeah, you know it's like
5151840	5154320	So uh-oh you're gonna come in and comment on that
5155040	5159280	I'm I'm just wrapping up. I was just telling him how you have to have somebody who asked why are you doing it that way?
5160400	5162400	Ooh beef uncured hot dogs
5163600	5167920	Mark wallberg is making hot dogs now. He has a whole restaurant thing going on. Okay
5168880	5170800	Can you turn the last thing?
5170800	5172800	Well, actually I need to talk about tech
5173680	5176480	How many things is that break? Why does this why couldn't this just be simple?
5176720	5179840	Why did I have to make my documentation website use javascript?
5180800	5183280	IBM I post that on twitter today
5183920	5188240	Seriously, all of all of IBM's documentation site requires javascript to read it. Ask yourself
5189280	5191280	How come that's a bad idea?
5193440	5195040	So
5195040	5196000	So
5196000	5198880	Web three to me and I did answer the question. What do you think of web three?
5198960	5201520	I think web three is the epitome
5202160	5204240	It's like if you took all the people if you took
5204880	5208880	Like like the whole rick and morty idea where you can separate the toxic cells from the good self, you know
5209120	5211120	If you were to take all of the toxic
5211440	5218320	Overengineers self from every engineer and you were to put that in a big vat of actual, you know goo in rick and morty style
5218400	5223920	And you were like have it like take on some sort of like nebulous form that could communicate
5224160	5226160	It would create web three
5227680	5232480	Because that's what it is web three is the absolute worst possible
5233280	5236240	design from the most over engineered
5237120	5239120	impractical
5239120	5244320	Frankly idiotic perspective you could ever imagine and and I that's all I have to say about that
5245520	5247520	It makes me really happy that
5247520	5250640	At least I have my feet on the ground and that sometimes I'm actually happy that I'm dumb
5251280	5254720	Compared to some of these other engineers because it causes me to think things through more
5255520	5257760	I I can't you know spit out, you know
5258480	5265200	Uh complexity theory algorithms or do land to calculus, you know at lunch. I'm not that guy. I can't do that. So
5266240	5270720	I'm glad sometimes because it keeps my feet on the ground and it makes me think through things
5271280	5276080	Um and and think and ask questions like why are all these dashes in all of our command lines?
5277680	5280960	Get off get off this as a good example of over engineered crap
5282160	5287840	You know when somebody created a a user interface that was an engineer is like we'll put one dash here for this
5288000	5290160	We'll put two dashes here. We'll allow colon for this
5290720	5293280	And that's why I made bonsai because I am a practical person
5293280	5298720	I don't like when people over engineer stuff and one of the most over-engineered things ever is get-up. So
5299200	5301200	That's a little rant about that. Um
5302240	5306960	No experience with snort and nips or nids. I wish I did. I'm super sorry. I can't talk about that
5307760	5309040	Uh
5309040	5314080	This is just the whole idea of looking at logs all the time and studying those and combining them all
5314640	5317840	That's been around since the days of like, um centralized, um
5318640	5326320	Uh system log, uh daemons, but it's still a thing. I still think it should be done. Um, what is nips
5327280	5329280	I don't know what nips is
5329280	5331280	network intrusion detection system
5331440	5336880	Umbrella term for combination of hardware and software. That's cool. I like the concept from what I understand of it
5338080	5340080	Um
5340560	5343680	Is the system that attempts to detect hacking activities to now have service attacks
5344400	5348080	I think these things are cool. I really do. Uh, I don't have anything
5348560	5353680	I don't my is just old school tripwire. We would just like check some every file on the whole system make
5354320	5356320	lists of of um
5356560	5358560	Exceptions and then watch for things to change
5358640	5362720	Uh security is actually a lot simpler than most people make it out to be
5363520	5364960	Kind of in that practical sense
5364960	5370800	all you really have to do to ensure a system is secure is track everything on the system and tell you when anything changes
5371440	5373040	You don't have to have fancy signatures
5373040	5377120	It can be gotten around by compiling the same malware and go that was in c before
5377520	5381200	You don't have if you just look for things on the system that are regularly changed
5381920	5385440	And and create ways to detect those changes in the system
5386000	5390560	Uh and report on them that that is the number blue one blue team approach that I think everybody should be doing
5390560	5395200	And I don't know that's how I caught the hacker who invaded my computer at home back when I set up my own mail server
5395760	5397760	Um, and that's how everybody
5398320	5400880	It should be doing it. I don't understand why it's so so hard
5401520	5403520	Uh the defender defeater
5403680	5405120	Yeah
5405120	5411600	What is eldep and I should use it so eldep is a lightweight directory access protocol. This is uh something came from the 90s that was used to
5412000	5418720	Uh put group information for corporations and stuff and it is still used a lot. Um, it's used in
5419440	5423680	We've talked about it before we talked about it with uh, I want to say hayden
5424400	5430160	And uh with free IPA and some things like that. It's built into active directory now as of may as of may 2022
5430800	5433120	Um, and it's the way that you get group permissions
5433840	5438400	Once a person authenticates to see if they can do things if you can authorize them to do different things
5439040	5442480	Uh, I think everybody should use it. It should be a part of your system
5442960	5449520	Uh in your identity management and how you do things. Uh, we will be putting open eldep on my lab here
5450240	5453680	Um, probably in the form of free IPA. Although I'm
5454320	5458560	I'm a little bit leery of free IPA now now that I've been looking back at nis, which is really old tech
5459280	5462640	Uh, but I want to see if there's something related to that before I make a decision right now
5462640	5469040	I'm just doing localized logins on everything and which is more zero trustee because it does use search for all that
5469760	5474480	Uh eldep is not a windows thing. No eldep is getting if you do a search for eldep
5474480	5479120	You're going to get a lot of hits for azure and active directory these days because that's usually where people are run
5479120	5482560	Or they're deploying it. Uh, but it's actually way older than that
5484080	5487680	Yeah on linux, it comes. Yeah, linux eldep has kerberos built into it
5488480	5490880	Kerberos is the name of the three headed dog
5491440	5493920	Greek dog that was guarding whatever and
5494960	5501760	Is mit technology designed to do password authentication without ever sending passwords over the over the wire
5502560	5506320	By exchanging data that's been signed using public key cryptography
5507120	5510800	So kerberos is the standard. Uh, even if you're not using it outright
5511680	5518160	You're using it inside of other things. It's kerberos is is built into pam for example and linux se and
5518640	5521360	And eldep and everything else. It's just not always front in the center
5522080	5525360	Uh, yeah the tickets that nobody really understands exactly
5526640	5532640	Uh, if you're familiar with wire shark, you can be familiar. Yep. It's another one. Yeah, and you can watch eldep over the wire too. Um
5533360	5538240	These days eldep is secured and you know over encrypted connections, but not always
5539040	5543760	Um, but most of the time these days eldep is used to give information about an account
5544560	5547840	Uh regarding, you know, what things this authorized to do and what it can do
5548480	5552400	Uh roles will say role-based authentication. I mean authorization
5552880	5559200	Um, but it and it can be used for authentication the first part that says i am me
5559760	5563520	Uh, but that i am me thing, uh, is now
5564240	5568480	Taking place elsewhere in kerberos and other things that are um
5569200	5571200	And then eldep is provides the other data
5571760	5573760	They get that right
5573920	5579200	Uh, it's still useful and not over engineered. I think public key cryptography is not at over engineered at all
5579280	5582000	I think I think it's actually the only natural way to do it
5582880	5584240	Um
5584240	5587680	Uh, it's the other things you call smart are harmful. No, absolutely not
5588240	5592160	No, and there are some things that have to be complex cryptography is one of those things
5592960	5597520	Um, and I you know and I accept that right? Uh, I I don't think cryptography can be
5598240	5602320	Although I mean you can make the argument that some of the cryptographic algorithms failed because of over engineering
5602880	5604480	If you I I'm not going to get into it
5604480	5612240	But if you like short like the failure of blowfish or rsa or any of the other ones that are no longer officially good, you know
5612960	5619520	Uh, you might you know uncover the fact that somebody was getting really clever and their cleverness ended up being their downfall
5620480	5622160	um
5622160	5625120	But you know, we do need cleverness. Don't get me wrong. So I yeah
5626160	5630720	Uh, does does how to I mean my favorite xkcd about this is
5631600	5637040	Uh, you guys know the xkcd about the password thing. It's a perfect example of this over engineering concept
5637040	5641760	That seems to be the theme today. Um, does anybody have a link to it? I'll go find it xkcd
5642960	5646160	Uh password. It's it's one of the most popular pass rots
5648160	5652800	Here it here it is, right? Wait. Oh troubadour common substitutions. You're risk
5654160	5656160	No, that's not it. Where is it?
5656720	5658720	That's not it
5659600	5661360	Any enigma
5661360	5664240	Too coffee just enough to use it effectively. Yes, it was
5665360	5666880	um
5666880	5668880	Dang it
5669120	5671120	Where's the one you guys know what I'm talking about?
5672640	5674640	password
5675120	5678960	Uh pass rod actually pass for encryption
5681120	5683760	If you know what it's the next kcd about the encryption thing
5686000	5690480	I'm trying to find it. I can't it's taking me forever because I'm slow
5691840	5695440	Or is it you just have to look for a club
5699360	5701360	Yes
5701840	5704480	Or is it I love it. I love it. I can't find it
5704480	5708240	I'm gonna I'm gonna spend all day trying to find it if I can't find it. You guys can try to help me find it
5708880	5712320	It's the one where he talks about his algorithm
5715680	5721680	Uh for defeating defeat cryptography how to defeat
5724800	5726800	Uh password cryptography
5727520	5729520	Ah
5731760	5735120	It's actually it's actually a joke about it and and and mr. Robot
5737360	5739360	Oh, here it is. Yeah, this is the one
5740720	5742720	Okay, so
5743040	5744720	Here we go
5744720	5746720	A crypto a crypto nerd's imagination
5747760	5754400	His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a multi-million dollar cluster to crack it. No good. It's 40 96 bit rsa encrypted
5754800	5756800	Blast our evil plan is foiled
5758080	5763680	What would actually happen his laptop's encrypted drug him and hit him with the five dollar wrench until he tells us the password
5766000	5768000	Got it
5768320	5773760	This this is my favorite because this is exactly how
5774640	5780400	This is engineers over here, right? And this is like practical dumb people
5781040	5785280	Threat models are a thing they are a thing
5786480	5788240	you know and
5788240	5793920	You know, it's like you spend like multi-billion dollars on the door and the wall next to it is two by fours and drywall
5795920	5797920	You know
5798320	5799760	It's like
5799760	5805040	But then they don't think about it. This is this is a pretty common meme out there. By the way, they're not dumb, right?
5806000	5808320	Uh, they're not so you see engineers
5809280	5810880	Yeah, I mean
5810880	5812480	you know, it's
5812480	5816480	And I think that this problem comes about because people overthink
5817600	5818960	Uh
5818960	5823760	The technology either because it's exciting to them because they really get off on mathematics or something or
5824960	5828960	Some other reason I don't know why but they they don't accidentally lock
5830080	5833040	ZQ says accidentally locked my keys inside a calm closet today
5833280	5836960	Then I realized the door was on backwards. So I just took a piece of metal in there and
5839280	5841280	I'm probably a vulnerability
5842000	5844000	Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to tell you
5844800	5849920	Yeah, you know, it's fun. It's it's fun to talk about. It's horrible when I when you experience it
5850000	5854240	So as I seems to be kind of the theme today, I hope I hope no one gets overly
5854640	5856480	Been out of shape on my picking on engineers
5856560	5860720	I am one and I am the first one to tell you that I've made tons and tons of mistakes
5861280	5864880	Uh, because I overthought something and some of these projects I threw away
5865120	5870400	Do you guys remember that parser that I made where I made my own sco sub language to do all the parsing?
5870800	5874800	And I was like, why don't I just like go? I mean, I totally threw the whole thing away
5874880	5877280	I threw like three weeks of work
5878080	5880080	and an entire
5880080	5881040	documented
5881040	5885200	Subline sub go api for this language that I had created and I chucked it all
5885840	5888560	And I I replaced it with like a one rune
5889120	5891440	Uh character scanner instead
5892320	5896880	And and then code did code generation when necessary and I was like, oh my god. What was I thinking?
5898080	5900640	And you know, we're going to go through those times. That's just human progress
5900720	5905920	But you know and I really shouldn't beat people up for over engineering things until they get like all
5906640	5911920	You know white towery, you know, ivory tower about it. It's like you're going to use what we give you and you're going to like it
5913440	5915920	And people get like that. I have lose my patience
5917280	5919280	uh
5919280	5923200	A lot of over engineering actually comes from corporate and management not from mentors themselves. I agree
5924080	5926960	Uh, let me give you an example of that one fun one fun. Uh
5927840	5931280	Uh, the crypto web three job you experienced it first hand really
5931840	5936560	So let me give you an example of that the engineer the management screwing stuff up. Okay
5937040	5940160	This is a true story from my buddy brent who worked in the military
5940720	5942960	I taught him linux, uh, you know back in the day
5943280	5947920	He had taught me salaris and he was kind of my mentor. I was the first official system of a job I had
5948160	5950880	I had been doing web development. I was like his webmaster before that
5951280	5955120	This was my first actual job, you know managing salaris and aix and everything
5955840	5956720	and
5956720	5963120	He told me a story once that we used to play chess and and and eat and talk stories because it's just a big job
5963760	5965040	Uh
5965040	5968800	At lunch and he told me the story once about how it's and I've told the story before his senior officer
5969760	5973760	Uh, he he did all the work to spec out a salaris, uh server
5974480	5980240	And he got the best one possible for the job and it cost like 20 50 000. It was like really spending
5981040	5983040	Um, but it was small
5983520	5987600	And if you know anything about technology, you know that if you want small you pay more money
5988240	5989280	Right
5989280	5994160	And so, I mean it was barely the size of like a for you tower today, right?
