{"text": " Okay, start. There we go. So we're now recording it. We're in dark mode today Mostly because it's a total disaster in my room right now. But as you can see, there is a server taking form It's coming alive my server and I've actually got another playlist on YouTube called home lab in it and It will be About how to set up your own home lab or how I set up my home lab and I don't know how or when I'll be recording that but we're gonna come to them So the first question that is everybody still talking about so I'm gonna talk about it is Did you buy all Raspberry Pi's in the world for your rig? And you can't see it but like right up here on the top there's a 16 by cost me 250 dollars by the way Yeah, 250 dollars to get an aluminum Raspberry Pi Hot swappable to you rack shelf and Yeah, and I'm gonna be putting that there For that if I know I didn't I actually have 30 or so Raspberry Pi's. I mean I keep finding them everywhere I need to remind everybody I used to run a company. I founded a company called skill stack in 2013 where I was you know Mentoring people in person at a school. I lived in a town home above it and the bottom floor was Just lab in school. You can go to twitter.com slash skill stack SK I'll SDAK if you want to see pictures of it from from back in the day and maybe I need to show you that really quick Because I want to All right, so to our studio audience who can't you're an audio only I'm going to twitter.com and I am pulling up some nostalgic photos from skill stack my Once popular Place and this is where I have my curriculum and there's like pictures and all sorts of things and if you go to actually if you Go to Instagram You'll see some stuff. The question is about Raspberry Pi and that's what I wanted to show you So actually Instagram is a little bit more fun if you go to instagram comm slash skill stack you'll see Videos and stuff that I've done and including So this is the there's my red rack behind me right behind my head That used to be my really really really really cheap. I mean look at how ugly it is, but you got to understand I ran my own company. I kept my costs really low And so I didn't have a proper rack. I do now because I work for a Big-ass company and I make a really cushy salary. So I've been dropping, you know, like $300 on to you Raspberry Pi Thanks, but this this is like the thing so all these little green lights out the bottom by the way Or I have 19 Mac minis that are installed Which make really really great? Cloud home lab kind of things. This is me organizing That was when I had to move skill stack into my apartment to my house that I rented for two years And then we moved here and so now as you know the ongoing saga. We're going to be moving within a year To some other location. We don't even know where To do my wife's MFA and we'll take a Raspberry Pi's with this But no, we did not buy all the Raspberry Pi's, but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from. Oh, this is a great This was a game camp. This was this guy this guy made his own like amazing thing We don't know where we're going so this is the game camp this was a summer camp that we had and that was my workstation at the time But I'm just showing you this we had like lightsaber camp It kind of stuck hot damn these kids are so young all these kids are in college now They're all in college now. Oh, I just found the box with lightsabers Yeah, I found the box of lightsabers This guy like distro hopped like ten times in like a week amazing student anyway, so We don't know. I don't think it's gonna be Wyoming. No, I don't know where So but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from so everybody's wondering where they came from I know I'm not buying them up They're leftovers. In fact, so where them people like why do you have all this apple? I mean, there you go. This is what I wanted to show you This is Raspberry Pi camp Check that out. Check that crap out He wrote that from scratch. He did it on himself the entire requirements Look at this one, man The requirements for this Raspberry Pi in case you can't see it the requirements for this Raspberry Pi class was just to like make one of the things was blank and He just he just kind of kept experimenting and putting wires everywhere and trying everything out And he didn't make in his own full-blown like microcontroller extension And I was like, oh my gosh, this is what happens by the way when you give people Freedom to be creative in their learning Yeah, and so that's where the Raspberry Pi's came from so I have about 30 I have a sort of robot. This is the old this is the old apartment where I used to live Before I got kicked out of that You give them the freedom and they'll that okay. Here's another here's Sean. This is this was a this was us getting hacked We we put a cloud server up We put up a cloud server This is security camp and we put a cloud server up and this is The cloud server got hacked within a day during the camp during the week on camp. We said how long will it take somebody to hack us? right and we were learning like all of these different commands and his cloud server got hacked his his honeypot got hacked within a day and And we were sitting there watching all the stuff it was doing and we were doing s trace This is s trace. This is s trace on the the process that had hacked us And so we could like see what the with the malware was doing and track it down and stuff. It's really really fun Anyway, good times No, he got we wanted to get hacked the people who got hacked first They was like fishing like we were fishing. So if you got hacked first, you're one of the lucky ones That means you got a bite. So he got a bot. He got a bite on the first day And somebody hacked his closet. The whole point was to show how quickly Unprotected did you see that royal typewriter right there by the way? Yeah, that real typewriter is was part of I just spilled my coffee on myself That's why I have a towel right here to protect myself from this kind of like mishap Because I'm an idiot and it's also really dark. My coffee cup is brown Hmm, I think I might have to add more vodka to it. I'm sure that was not a contributing factor Are we still having fun master shells Matt you want in okay, here you come You're gonna give me crap. I know but I'm used to it All right, wait, wait, wait, give me a second Hey Rob, hi, how are you doing? Audio is a little bit messed up. Let me fix the audio here my audio Problem with my device Anyway, so yeah, we did a lot of stuff there, but that's where the Raspberry Pi came from and I promise you Uh, this whole open source contributed some coffee to the salt. No, thank God my map my laptop's closed Yeah, so it wasn't it was only half full the guy or half empty whichever way you want to look at it Hmm, and there's my old IP numbers. Anyway Do I need to add that to the list so I have to answer that right now I Mean I'm gonna add it to the list. Let's do that. I'll add that one right now answer that for you right now. Yes Yes, I do Anybody seen triumph of the nerds If you haven't seen triumph of the nerds, then you don't understand what a compliment it is to call me a nerd So go watch it seriously Seriously, if you have not watched triumph of the nerds, you need to All right triumph of the nerds Videos, I think it's out there for free. There it is Excuse me 1996 documentary triumph of the nerds it's like a three-part documentary that goes through the creation of nerddom and if you really want to understand the origin of personal computing and the internet there was a Triumph of the nerds to the car. No, it was like two point two point one I think and that was how the internet got made and I think it's Bob cringely is the guy who did it the same guy who famously did the interview with Steve Jobs Which they found old footage of which resurfaced near the end there There's two point. Oh, if you want to get a real solid handle on Technology history the most significant me can read the innovators, which is like a 300 400 page book or you can go Watch triumph of the nerd. So if you haven't seen it cue it up. It's amazing. It's really fun It's it's it's from a different time Interestingly enough the guy who did this the guy who did this actually lived in Steve Jobs neighborhood He worked for Apple computer when it was in a garage And then and then it became so much more. So I'll just tell you about that. So absolutely. I'm a nerd But the real question is are you a nerd or a geek and if you haven't seen that nerd or a geek back when you could actually watch When you could watch Rhett and link Rhett and link have completely sold out. They're just grifters now I Used to really love Rhett and link. This was eight years ago But if you haven't seen the epic rap battle of nerd versus geek which I cannot show here because we're doing you know a thing on YouTube Make sure you watch it If you don't know the difference between a need and a Gurt egg, did I say a neek a Geek is like we I'm not gonna tell you what they are. You need to watch Rhett and link have this nice fight It's really it's a really great rap battle. I think you'll really enjoy it So they are definitely different But Like play it like ten times and slow it down and like listen to what they say Because it it pretty much perfectly captures the difference between a geek and an earth So that's that what this is a question What's your favorite tech art anything related to goes logo? I Really really really do like goes logo those of you who know Ren\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 French and is is Rob Pike's wife and The gopher is was designed by Ren\u00e9 French Who has done many other things as well? And You could go you can go look at them And and see about them We can look at some of the different images here. So here is all of the thing I really like I mean is is in fact Ren\u00e9 friend having been involved with artists a lot gone to a lot of art galleries You can watch it in my rl streams on twitch some of which have been saved. I spoke coffee on myself as well. Well My wife my Ren\u00e9 French actually reminds me of my wife a little bit. She's got that whole art look going on and She's like really talented and you know, she's She wearing Rob Pike's glasses there that looks like It looks like she's wearing Rob Pike's glasses right there That's her favorite glasses issue. It's like they're wearing the same glasses or something Rob Pike would usually wear glasses like that So Rob Pike you made Go Lang One of the primary contributors to go Lang is made this this is like one of the very firsts to go Lang I absolutely love love love the artwork behind go Lang. It's probably one of my favorite The I mean as opposed to for example, like the logo for Java, which you know was never any good Where's the little guy? There he is Duke the Duke logo, you know, I'm just not impressed. It was fine. It was okay. It was the 1990s In terms of art and tech I do think they go well together. I Actually made the logo for Tomel I made it. I created it. I committed it. This is my logo True story you can actually go look at the commit if you go look at the commit on the GitHub, you'll see that I made it It was actually a joke It was kind of a joke I made a pull request I Made it seriously. I made her pull request You want to see it? You want it? This is my like my one of my few claims to fame I had to put it in a question for him in my stats of the ways Yeah Did you make the Tomel logo and the answer is yes, I did it's a very small claim to fame But if you go to github.com slash Tomel I also got Tom to kind of like pick up the pace I was kind of on him because I was making a thing called file system as a database which I still want to do with YAML this time and I Actually made Tomel Tomel spec To oopsie to try to get people to look it up again. It's not there anymore. Damn it. I wonder if it's on github at all It's a long time ago This is it's interesting because I had no idea about anything on Rust and I actually burnt sushi for example one of the The the pran the moderator and also one of the primary contributors to a lot of the Tomel parsing He wrote Burt's issue made one of the part when they want it made the Tomel parser. That's really popular for us He also resigned very very publicly and famously From the Rust project over quote and I quote you can go read the PR Hypocrisy among the Rust leadership You can go read it if you want to read the whole drama and so actually funny because I kind of you know Rub shoulders them a little bit while I was doing some of the Tomel parsing actually helped Tom Paletier Do some of the that the Tomel parser with some of the test code for Tom for for There's been super Susie's Tomel and again back then I was thinking that Tomel was the one true way to create a file system as a database We just have a directory and you put a Tomel file in there Recursively and you end up with kind of a flat file database that's structured. I still want to do something with that with yaml cherry and I Remember Ramirez. I forget her his or her name their name in the chat. We were talking about that the other day And something I'd still like to go but some polities Plenty is actually Tom Palletier is like one of the coolest people I have ever worked with an open source and because Tom actually it's like, you know what I've always wanted to write a parser I'm gonna write one and I'm gonna write it for Tomel and I think it's the I think it's better than Burt's issues But whatever And so actually evaluated it and this actually got me into writing my own parsers So there's a lot of parsers out there. There's a lot of people who like obsess about this kind of stuff So you can go out there and work with them. I do have some commits on here somewhere Maybe my contributions are not that big big enough to site. I mean, I actually made a separate Thing for the test code so it might be a separate repo that I did and I can't remember where it is Anyway, but yeah, let me show you that actual official commit to them to the Tomel project Tomel laying the Tomel. Yeah, there it is There it is there's my one commit to the Tomel project and You can actually find it if you try to go I can't even remember where Bob T logo, I mean, how would I put this I go through issues or code for requests I'm just showing off at this point. What kind of show is this? but I'm super proud of it. So there so let's go search for logo Alt Tomel logo change log Tomel has a logo. There we go What changes that was this one oh That wasn't me no, where is it Tomel has a logo. Oh, they put it in the change log Yeah, Tom Tom approved my pull request that that was the that was the thing I wanted to show you actually prove my My poor cause I was like super happy Tom made get him by the way like made it He also made gravator So he's a big deal over in Silicon Valley. He's also does his own thing these days You can read all of his there's some recent drama with somebody who worked with him on Twitter but whatever and Regiment js. Yeah, he's been a lot stuff. He's he's he's great and You know see all results I get a No, I where's my local commit. I'm gonna have to I want to find it. I hope they didn't delete it That was like that's like my My one small thing I don't even think I'm gonna register as a contributor because I was like my only contribution to the whole project ever and it was kind of a joke Seriously, it was a joke. I was like here. Okay. I'm gonna have to find it because it's a fun joke Is it logos? Yeah, is it? All right. Let me go find it. I Don't know if that's gonna know damn it. Of course. I have to do like Maine or whatever I Help me help me Obi-Wan Kenobi logos. Okay. This is yeah sink get attributes for Tom all Tom on PNG six years ago What? Uh history let's go look at the history added logos. Yay me I'm in a contribution Seriously, you know the feeling the first time you get one of your I don't care how sick I mean, you know Chris know this committing to the Linux kernel and I'm like making logos for Tom Same things. I mean in terms of like sick, you know, happiness, you know, so I like yeah, I did this added logo files Seriously, it was like it was like 1 a.m. Some night and I was like, you know what? Obviously everything is like everything is just a square bracket So let's just do this and then the PR is something. Where's the PR history? Where is this actually say the does it actually say it? Where's the PR? I don't I don't know get as well as I should I kind of do but not as well as I should I'm trying to look for the commit history because it said it said, you know, I won't care if you don't commit it It's just kind of fun Yeah, I don't I don't see like it's my comic got squashed or something. I Oh, I don't I don't I don't see it anymore. Let me see. Where's it? You know the feeling? Yeah Yeah, well So whatever, I mean Mike I did make a the PR wait pull request. Maybe it's in there. Oh, maybe it's in here It's close. It's it's close It's closed or an extra on Damn Rob Damn There's no record how far back to have to go Can have equals lost of I know I do feel lost. I mean how far back to have to go can I can I can I do a search? Logo oh There it is took a shot at logos. Yeah, my feelings won't be hurt if rejected figured what the hell That was so much fun I seriously it was like, you know, it was late at night. I'm like, what the hell? Let's just try this So because I was trying to get it to pick up steam. I actually created tumble dash spec Which I think didn't get picked up. I mean, but anyway, I really like it because now they use it for everything It's like all over now. You can go on the internet and search for tumble logos and I made it It's like my logo everywhere So there are rust people Every time a rust comes out and the rest people come out to me like yelling me. Okay, but but but I made the Tomo logo Because you know rust uses Tomo. I mean rust can the rust contributors are like Bert Zushi in the gang I mean, they were like fundamental to the creation of Tomo and making sure it became cool and all There's many other cooler logos than mine, but it was just a shot at it. Look. Oh my god. It's even on Wikipedia My logo is on Wikipedia. I Can't stop. I just can't stop This is saying anything about the logo who made a logo To verbose that's true. That's why I don't use it. I use YAML these days It doesn't say anything about the history of the logo. I should like make a Wikipedia edit Where did the logo come from? Rob was bored on one random night. I know I should like edit it and add it. I should say I made the Tomo logo So, I mean, it's a small thing But it's the small thing. I should I do it right right now. I have to don't have the login or something Where should I put it? Where should I put it if I'm gonna do this? Shit, I'm scared. You're scaring me I need to put like Criticism, it's like just criticism. Holy cow. Why don't we have history and then it's like the logo I'm kind of nervous because I don't do Wikipedia ever Example criticism see also external links at it I'm used to I I set up a Wikipedia Site for IBM when I was on my team there and now I feel like I don't know what I'm doing So it's probably not the thing to do during our Q&A session, but I don't have to come back I'll have to come back and add it. I tell it I'll put it I'll report a request to that to the community if there's anybody in the community Who actually knows how to do Wikipedia edits and has an account and has done so like reliably go go go add that I made the logo Put that on my tombstone made the Tomo logo When I die My greatest accomplishment Your email or something, you know, okay, not now, but maybe maybe someday I do need however to bookmark this. I put that in my little cast then. Yeah Zett create just a reminder I Create the Tomo logo. How do we get in this? I don't remember how we got we got an art. We got an art. That was it. Yeah, I I Did I made all the skill stack art? I made the van art oops wrong thing and Stuff So I actually love graphic design. I Don't spend nearly enough time doing it. I made like the can logo and some stuff I really really love graphic design. I particularly grab, you know, like icons and stuff like that That's something I really enjoy doing. I think it's a drafter in me I used to do a lot of drafting and map making for Dungeons and Dragons and stuff like that Do we have any other Dungeons and Dragons fans out there former players of Dungeons and Dragons or current? Because that really got me into that type of art So so yeah, I Was going to show you that the Instagram of that. I mean, I'm still this is still a question Oh, here's my wife's plate page. So I am married to Nicholas. I'm gonna say Nicholas to Doris Kappner Who is in the other room and insisted I have coffee with her today? Uh, oh boy movies get off that real quick. Um She is doing sculpture. She's obsessed with sculpture lately Uh, but yeah, and so being married to her is kind of nice because she's just she's not really interested in digital art Uh, and I kind of am I kind of obsessed with I've built Uh, you're talking about art, right? So I built ed tech retreat Uh, I get to brag about this. I guess Uh, I I in second life I built the entire thing Um, this I made this logo from scratch from scratch including the shading everything I was super proud of it. I made t-shirts with that logo on it I made a 3d rendition of the thing that like rotated over my head and blah blah blah I mean, this was a long time so I mean, this was really a long time ago. This is before my divorce Etc. We had dance parties. God, we had fun. We had so much fun And there's actually images of ed tech retreat Uh, so this that here this is the um architect rendering of the thing I eventually built in full Um, anyway, so there's like a flicker Feed on this. I mean you were asking about logos and art and stuff So that's kind of what triggered this Uh, there's no flicker feed for a tech retreat. That's so sad I feel bad I feel bad that all of our pictures are not there anymore I think there's like a twitter feed for that too Ed tech retreat Uh, that was an amazing creative endeavor. I really really like to oh we already hear Is it instagram? Maybe it's instagram Is it instagram? Instagram might have more things Okay, remember, I don't think there was an instagram back then We go we click we click on things and go to the different Amy I haven't seen her forever Uh, yeah all these amazing people that were educators And I got into education through Through this through twitter actually, uh, I wanted to get into education. I wanted to do more than just, you know work and couldn't find it but uh Ed tech retreat mohacks. This is my avatar Custom had all reggae goes design nice Uh, jump ushaw jump ushaw. We actually paid this guy $3,200 to architect our island for us, and then I built it um but yeah I mean and that but you were talking about art. That's so I think that's where it came up Uh, I'm trying to I'm trying to find my Images, but I I think they're probably gone at this point. It's been so long ago Uh, yeah, nothing nothing here Nothing here, man. That's kind of crazy It's kind of crazy because there was so much stuff on there. We had like Lots of content, but it looks like it's all gone now. Anyway question What was the question question was Uh, what's your favorite favorite tech art anything related to goes little so I Yeah, I mean, that's that's my favorite. Um You know, I worked for Nike for a while and we did we did tech art there as well But nothing like that Tom a logo is the one this is my silly one that I made then I did a lot of art in second life in the 3d worlds Um, all right. So next question Uh, what is the cheapest homelab server I can buy so I actually Seated this question And because I've been getting this question a lot because I built a homelab server and I'm you know putting all my old hardware on there But we found the the hp z Uh, 640 and 600 series to be by far Uh, the most affordable after a day of research So, uh, I actually bought this server And it's renewed. This is a different one. This is not the same one. This is only eight core But you can get them For all kinds you can get them Uh, there's a 32 gigabyte memory. That's a smaller one Um, but yeah, I mean you can like stack them, right? So I actually have one Um, let me see if I can find it hp Yeah, here it is Uh, this is the actual one. Okay, and yes, the docs is my location. That's fine Um, so this okay, so Let me I have to tell you something about this. Okay. So this price tag 2250 $2,252 Includes Uh, and this is something I didn't notice at first. It includes um 2 by This is the part I missed when I was looking at the specification You see the 2 by it says 2 by z on 14 core processors. This system I have for $2,300 has 28 cores That can be doubled 28 dual cores. So so it has a total Of 56 possible cpu's when you're allocating virtual machines And it has 120 28 gigabytes Uh, which could be upgraded um ecc memory And 512 gigabyte solid state drive for $2,300 and I defy you to find anything that's cheaper than this So far it's been running really solidly. I have it over here running Uh, and I'll keep reporting on it, but this by far is the cheapest I was able to find Uh online. I I don't have any recommendations for any, uh, crypto of any kind. I don't do that stuff um, but but in terms of like Home lab and like instantly being able to make your own Kubernetes clusters or putting if you're going to do proxmox Just put it on here. Don't put it on anything above 14 nodes or your cluster will collapse like mine did And we'll get to that. Um, so this is a fantastic Uh way to go If if you want to do that, this is by far the cheapest thing I've ever found Uh Another there's another question. Why do you prefer linux as a subsystem within windows? uh I prefer Linux as a subsystem within windows because and I've answered this lots and lots of times But I will just give you the short answer because I stream game And I use windows at work Because they don't allow you to lose linux on your desktop at work and 99 of the places you're going to work You can't use linux on your desktop So that's the main reason Selfishly the main reason that I use windows for streaming and everything Is because the streaming tools and obs are over the top better than anything on linux Uh, you can't do it on linux. I did it for a year Uh, but it sucks And anybody who tells you differently is lying to you. They're told I can objectively rip down any argument that says That linux streaming is just as good as windows streaming. It absolutely is not Absolutely is not. Let's mention if you're going to do gaming Right and I know linux gaming has come a long way, but it is nowhere near windows gaming not even close So I do windows gaming and I haven't had a hiccup. I actually my windows machine Uh Goes stays running these days up to a month Uh, I don't have to reboot it for anything even if it has system things that says hey, you should probably reboot I'm like fine. I'm gonna wait And then so what I do is I run a virtual machine that's got a gigabyte surround and two or three cores Uh on side inside of my windows machine and then I ssh into it just like I would do if it were over there And in my new home lab Uh, I'm going to start doing that even more. In fact, they have the same name I have anton as the name is kind of a you know A nod to silicon valley And and I'm going to be sshing into anton, which is now living over here And we'll be on a ups and can run 24 seven blah blah blah blah And then I don't have to depend on a vm for anything, but it but it's kind of a stage, right? So, uh, if you don't have that if you don't have a server yet, then Um, you you might want to consider a virtual machine that's running a one-two server specifically Way better than red hat across the board for reasons. I'll talk about in a bit and um And and then I I just use windows for everything else And then my my work computer officially is a mac And I also have a mac so this whole bigotry about what computer you use You just need to get over it on my opinion because I mean mac hardware is top of the line and I mean and I actually might these mac minis are rock solid I have been running these mac minis in my cluster for Over three years and they are silent. They don't put out any heat They just are really really good hardware and they have just really great design So they're fantastic for for running linux Unfortunately red hat doesn't agree that linux the red hat linux should be run on a mac and so they decided to not support it Which is one of the reasons that I abandoned red hat and open shift um, and and I'm going to actually talk about that now so So in a nutshell I've been complaining about this a lot recently and I'm just going to go out and just going to say it um and By the way, if you get a chance to run linux on your desktop like I did at ibm for 12 years Go for it. It's a really great way I ran fedora on my desktop because I supported red hat at ibm For 10 or 15 years and I wrote rpm packages to install software. I know red hat inside and out I owned stock in red hat in 2002 And sold it by the way after they did the whole fedora crap. So let me tell you a story I know you like it when I tell stories. So I'm going to tell you a story. How much time do I have? Uh, stories are easier for me to make my point. Okay, so way back when there was a company called Uh red hat. All right, so I think that red hat started when did they start anybody know? So red hat started When I want to say it was something like 99 98 um Uh for more headquarters Uh, let's see opening American Subs today founded in 1993. Wow, really. Okay. That makes sense Yeah, because 93 94 that was when yeah, no, that's that sounds about right It sounds about right because that was when 94 wasn't when I got into the Linux really good. Actually. No, god. It was before that No, they must have been They must have it. No, they just weren't popular yet Okay, so here's the story So, you know travel in time with me back to the 1990s when Linux became a thing a big thing In fact, right before that unix was a big thing. Everybody was into Indigo colored, you know, 80s colored work stations that were nice and pretty And it was all about the work station. In fact, that led to Steve Jobs making next step, which was a work station It was all about work stations all about 3d as when Pixar was created and we would move past the pc We moved past pcs You know the max and the ibms and all that the people used to get worked on and accounting stuff and all that And we kind of moved into this new age of like work stations work stations were the cool thing These were these like 10 000 systems that sat on your desktop for doing 3d modeling and and drafting And you know, whatever. I mean like really amazing stuff right and that was also the dawn of the worldwide web So we started to see these things doubling as web servers and blah, blah, blah so you go back to that time and Unix was proprietary. There was a unix provider called Solaris Which was founded in stanford for free by the way, according to the stanford university policy Which says you can start up very interesting story If you want to see thank you for this something if you want to see the full story of Solaris I cannot recommend more. It's very boring, but recommend more triumph of the nerds 2.01 Which goes through the creation of the internet and it talks about macabre, you know, the uh, what's his face? Uh, who started some microsystems and then you know, uh, he was I mean, it's it's there's a lot there to talk about Either creation of ethernet and all of that So anyway, Solaris and sun microsystem who by the way, if you happen to recognize the name later invented java Uh, and then marketed it for 500 000 dollars the largest marketing budget of any language ever in history um Became a thing so the ellison it wasn't ellison. That was oracle Yeah, it was a completely different thing happening. It was very very proprietary No, Larry Ellison made oracle No, I'm I'm thinking of macafe the guys started three come Oh god, let me get his name uh Who started he was part of the Uh, he was part of the original uh, palo alto crew at his iranx and then he's he forked off his own thing um And it's it's like escaping me Robert Metcalfe, that's it. It's not macafe. That's this that's the software guy. That's the security guy. It's Metcalf Robert Metcalfe 1979 um so uh, okay, so anyway um In this atmosphere of like You know, we need to the AT&T unix was 3000 dollars a seat And so there was lots of stuff coming up. Berkeley made bsd. Berkeley, you know that at Berkeley. They made it Uh, there was lots of people experimenting at torwald's across the the world was experimenting with making Uh a replacement for minix, which was was college professor's colonel And that then he came up with linux, but they didn't have any way to talk to anybody else because there was no internet yet Yeah I think the stream dropped But it could be my internet Oh, I hope I hope not and please confirm for anybody else that the stream is dropped. I I still see I see a a red bit rate Says he went offline Uh, but i'm not offline. It says i'm still streaming Going up and now you're back to zero viewers Yeah, what's up with that? It dropped 30 seconds. It's back That is really weird Um, is it back? I mean, uh, yeah, it's back now. It is back now. Okay. Well, thankfully that'll still be on the youtube Mostly just me talking, but thank you Uh, you dropped for me Yeah, I don't know what dropped. I can't begin to Guess maybe it's my server. I don't know. We'll see probably not, but Everybody back. Okay. So so anyway, let me finish the story. So, uh, at the time You know, people were thinking about different versions of unix and everything and So there was slack where there were lots of options And one of the biggest ones early on the alternative the unix was solaris, which is proprietary But it was still kind of freeform and everybody loved it because they had a better attitude And but they were still proprietary and at the same time Linux kind of became a thing because it's like no, we really want something that's free and it was actually, uh, the guy who taught me about unix Who I said, man, I wish I had this at home and he turned he goes well He can always run linux and so I started running linux at home and um And at the time there weren't that many options that I had a power pc mac because I was doing web design and thing And so I I ended up doing mock linux Later I would get a p2 opinion and I would end up running Slackware for a while and then I would try mandrake linux, which is susie And eventually I would use red hat and red hat came out when red hat came out on the scene It was a big deal Red hat was a huge deal and it was probably the most important free, uh distribution on the planet Now fast they promised, you know, that they were going to support everything and and everything in it And that was really great. Everybody was really behind it Uh, and then 2002 or something came around and they decided to make fedora and they said look we're going to make Uh red hat proprietary in other words, we're going to sell it for the to the enterprise Uh, and we're not going to release red hat for use by the the community, but We're going to make this thing called fedora so people can volunteer their time and effort And build up fedora and we can steal all of their innovation put it into our product and sell it Because that's what they did and at the time there was a major major like Backlash against red hat I mean, it was a serious backlash anybody that's that old might remember it Um, but they were a disaster. I mean, they were a disaster of a company making horrible decisions Moving into I mean not horrible decisions Maybe decisions that were in their best interests that we're going to make them a lot of money, which it did And they became the standard distribution for enterprise And everybody else was like man, we want to do that too So that was pretty much the first open core company That's a term coined by git lab, which means their product is open source But they make money on it on the side by all their Proprietary add-ons and if you really want to get into this go watch dalman talk about all the little proprietary crap that they Inject into linux in order to stick their hooks into enterprise and make them pay big subscription rates and stuff So and that you might be fine with that, you know, you might be fine with that But that is not the linux way It is not the fos and open source way and there was a massive backlash against it But nobody cared because red hat was making gobs and gobs of money because it was bringing linux into the enterprise and to this day red hat is still so deeply deeply embedded in the enterprise that ibm bought them for 30 something billion And now consider changing their name for a moment. Apparently that's that's the rumor to red hat because it was so significant So now ibm, you know, who brags every year about how many software patents it has And keeps back engineers from becoming distinguished engineers unless they don't get a patent Who lied to me in the 1999 with the peace love and linux campaign or to get me in the door and then turns out It's all a bunch of bullshit That company is the company that now owns and operates red hat And if you think for a second that red hat is ever going to do anything in the best interests of the overall linux community You'd be mistaken as a company individual engineers at red hat will There's many many individual engineers and they support open source and they're doing amazing things uh The most controversial linux commit that ever happened in my history is system d The guy who invented it invented it at red hat for the sake of enterprise because enterprise had a specific need And they said that they had a specific need and they made it and they pushed it in and they got it in all of enterprise And now it's in a bun tune. It's in everything else. It's highly controversial. I'm actually still okay with it Slightly the guy that made it by the way. I guess where he went he quit from red hat and he went he works for microsoft now Which if I if you know anything about the history of linux The idea that the lead engineer the person who got death threats for creating system d is now working for microsoft I mean, it's all I have to say about that and you just know what i'm talking about now microsoft ironically has moved forward And they are more pro linux than I think sometimes even red hat is I mean, you know, they're doing they're still very proprietary But the the point is is that all of these companies that said that Balmers words exactly that linux is a viral operating system and any company is crazy to install it Are all like changing their tune and saying oh linux is awesome. We're going to do it Uh, do you think non non system d distros are a big deal? I don't know Uh, I don't know. I I don't think you can get away without system d reasonably There's no motivation behind it if you're going to do that you might as well just go bsd And there's a lot of software that there's a lot of like, you know routers and stuff that use it still so Uh, nobody knows the system d a system d replace it replace the init system that it's kind of And there's many advantages of it and disadvantages the advantages are you have this monolithic startup system That's not really unixy Um, but it has you know state so it can keep track of things better Uh, it can be more secure and but it you know at the cost of being this big monolith that has to be deployed It has all control to the whole system. It's a very very controversial thing That controversy has largely passed though and it's now the standard in all enterprise linux distros Uh, so uh, but bsd unix which is still the primary distro used in router software And stuff like that does not use it Uh, and it still uses the traditional init system. So you have to go do your own research on that. Um, I I don't really don't have an opinion on that. I do think That we kind of have to make some, you know con concessions. I mean cononical and shuttleworth taught us that That the linux world has to make concessions with the enterprise community if we're going to move linux forward So it's kind of a delicate dance. You have to you know make in order to to to walk that middle line But red hat is clearly not and this is this is the tipping point for me. Okay And I know the question was about open shift and I'll get to that But the question the the question is about, you know, red hat and open shift So this weekend and I wrote about this so might as well if you want to go read about it this weekend. I I installed Red hat on my mac mini, okay And I was like, okay I installed rocky linux and uh, which is you know red hat and I went through all the problems It's got a horrible graphic installer. I mean, it's disastrously bad compared to a bunch of server A bunch of server install is so stinking slick. I just don't have words for how good it is And I have been using that my whole life. I mean recently and so then I go So then I try to do red hat and red hat just falls on its face It can't do certain things. It doesn't have this other thing. It doesn't have this other thing and Uh, no, I installed rocky linux not red has enterprise linux. Do they have a different installer? If they have it if there's a different installer With then I will have to eat my hat And go do red hat enterprise linux installer instead of rocky linux installer. Either way Uh, the issue that I hit after that Uh, still applies. So We hit an issue and I actually wrote about this in my zettelcast and you go read it where Um, I found a forum on red hat that said Do all of these things if you want to get your mac mini to work With red hat with red hat networking stuff and it was, you know, totally doable It was just quite a bit of stuff and I have like 19 of these things that I have to set up And I was going to have to go through all of these individual steps for all of them And you know red hat tries to have a smart install But it really sucks compared to cloud in it and stuff like it in in canonical and you know in in ubuntu It's not even the same. In fact ubuntu could be cited as the the standard for cloud-based, you know operating system initialization cloud in it is by far the industry standard for that and So anyway, so red has got this other answer and in the forum thread Somebody says well, this is on a mac and the the the person officially representing red hat Basically threw him under the bus and said Oh, well, that's mac hardware. We don't we don't ever test on anything on mac And and the reason that that offends a guy like me who was alive and owned red hat stock in 2000 2001 And eventually sold it when they did the whole fedora thing is because back then Red hat promised the world that they were just as much a member of the overall linux community as everybody else That they were going to maintain that love and support for linux on all hardware, you know And that we were going to continue with the mission of empowering old hardware with new linux distro installations and Recycling, you know old computers, which is all I mean that this is the core values Of linux if you're in the linux community, those are our core values That we we have choice we get to say what we want to do we can we can make it so that it runs on any hardware And to be fair red hat still does run it just takes all this extra work And so for red hat official people to say we really don't care about you if you're running on mac Is basically just them confirming what everybody has known all along would end up happening in 2022 The only thing they care about is enterprise period. It's in the name red hat enterprise linux There's no such thing as anything but enterprise them because people don't run mac minis in the enterprise because that would be silly There's actually a lot of people who do They're fantastic home lab machines, by the way, they're much more powerful than a raspberry pi They have better hardware and they're cheaper than a lot of mainframe, you know other big systems And if you're not going to do virtualization and you want an actual hardware instance, they're actually pretty good for that So, you know as long as they have intel chips in them and they have one thing is a whole different question We don't even go there So but you know, there's no plan for them to support it But but the the arrogance of them to just say oh, we don't care about mac people That just really upset me and frankly You know, if I am an enterprise cto, I'm not going to care about that either I'm like, no, I'm really happy that you're spending all of your money and time and energy Supporting my hardware. Why would you even dream of wasting your energy? You know making sure to test your distribution on any mac hardware at all. That's a waste of your time And if I'm an enterprise cto, I agree with that But I'm not an enterprise cto. I'm a guy running a home lab and I'm I'm Taking all of the hardware that I have and there is a company that has values that are consistent with that And that's canonical. You can you can throw them under the bus all you want, but the name ubuntu means what does it mean? What does ubuntu mean? And if I don't we're in short ubuntu has a few meanings when used as a As a naguni bantu term ubuntu means humanity. However, it is sometimes translated as I am because we are So the diagram of ubuntu is, you know, the logo is like all these arms and arm and arm And you know canonical has done some weird things. They are a company as well, but the company values have never changed I mean, they're just as relevant in the enterprise microkates and all the stuff that they're doing Uh, and and they're doing, you know, like really really amazing things And so they're you know, I haven't seen about red hat red has become the apple of linux red hat really has become the apple of linux They They want to say that they're doing free stuff. They really don't care They're just catering to the enterprise and they just need to come clean and own it Um, and then everybody else can make that decision if you want to be relevant in the enterprise But I tell you what there's a lot of enterprises that are picking that are avoiding red hat And so the reason and I actually don't like open shift for all the same reasons red hat and open shift Have done everything in their power to lock you in to their product and um so No, it's not like 10. No, I don't know. So the um So the the problem the problem we have Is that we have an enterprise operating like an enterprise with all of its priorities which are to lock you in and create systems that you depend on completely And they've very openly but they've been very open about doing that and they They're trying to do that and for I don't want that I don't want that a bottom line. I I want open standards and red hat can tell you all they want about open standards But as long as they control the standard And and they have been doing that. I mean and they've done some good things. I mean bilda was great It took red hat to kind of go at it proprietary wise with docker. Docker was also one of these companies I want to lock you in they just proved it by forcing everybody to pay for their enterprise product Docker desktop So they've always been a company and they haven't really given a crap about free and open source software at all At the end of the day, they're a company and they need to make money And there's people there's people in the company who like to believe that they Have the the needs of the open source community at heart But then when they force everybody who's already got desktop linux on their enterprise systems to pay money because it's a big You know behemoth enterprises got the money Then you see their true colors show and they there's nothing wrong with them making money They're actually legally bound to make money. That's part of what being an s-corp or a c-corp is But They just need to own that they are no longer free and open source. They really don't care They care about making money and so I know i'm going kind of off the off the edge here, but People know that i've been kind of in the middle of the road when it comes to like corporate enterprisey conservative kind of you know, you know values and ethos and you know Really really off the deep end fsf kind of like if you're not using gpl v3, you're the devil and should be cancelled You know, and i'm kind of in the middle there But this whole experience with my lab has kind of shifted me back towards the fsf side Not quite i'm more like torval torval's is kind of dead center in the middle of it Uh, you know, he understands the needs of corporations and thinks you gpl v3 is the devil and I agree, but but You know, he would not go so far as to say Everybody should put red hat on all their computers You know, he stays out of that fight completely mostly by focusing on the kernel architectures and stuff So that's a pretty long rant, but I I feel like I owe it to everybody Let's see if we can change the tone up a little bit though Uh, the open nature of linux and proliferation of distros saves us a lot. I I agree And you know and and somebody let me let me show you another symptom of this, okay So somebody said to me today, uh lbg, I think it was, you know, who's fond of reminding me of stuff that I forget Which is always good They said, well, we would be nowhere in the container space Uh, if it weren't for red hat And and and lbg told me about this site github.com slash containers Do you see any indication on this site that this site is red hat the company? There's none You have to like dig. There's no official statement that this that this website is from red hat Why doesn't red hat put red hat in their github container and their github name? Because they know That's what I think I think it's because they know they know if they were to put github.com slash red hat and nobody would open it And so yeah, I have a look at nix's pretty cool So so no so they they went to github.com containers. There is no way for you to know And and let's see you and they started as soon as you start looking at the technology list You're like realizing hmm pod man. Oh build a scopio. What the hell? This is red hat Right And then you start to realize and then you start to look at the names here You get there's a guy with a red hat. Just hope he was awesome I mean look as I said the people at red hat are awesome the company Right so just said he's really awesome software engineer at red hat You know and the rest of them they're not going to tell you where they work I mean, you know who they were if you know you know names so you can look at them So so this this is a good. This is a good example of red hat Trying to hide the fact that they're red hat because they don't want to be associated with all the things red hat has become associated with And and that includes filming their nose at Anything that they don't like or any any of the the other part of the linux distribution They the red hat is one of the worst linux citizens. They are the apple of linux They and as far as I'm concerned. I don't want anything to do with red hat ever again Uh in terms of a distribution and as a company I I will still use their their Contributions because I have to I can't avoid them Because I don't you know, I don't have a say they don't care what I say They you know so build a pod man and things and they'll continue to make stuff that You know is used out there and I still think that there's stuff that you just like apple. I use apple products, right? But I hate apple I know I it's hard not being a hypocrite. I mean, how are you going to get work done if you don't use it? So it's like, you know, it doesn't mean I have to like it, right? so um Anyway, uh speaking of things I I come to not like recently. I know this is a very ranty night Today, but I I I feel like I I mean I wasted a lot of time this weekend on stuff that I wish I hadn't Uh, and I wish I had thought through a little bit better Uh, so open shift is as everybody knows is kubernetes Is red hats variation on kubernetes? Uh, it has some very good things in it. It it it to be completely honest though The biggest difference between red hat and canonical is red hat over engineers everything And they're brilliant the red hand engineers are brilliant and they over engineer shit and they don't make it usable It's it's one of their regular problems and canonical Is really really good at simplifying and thinking about usability But they sometimes lack the engineering expertise that red hat has and what would be really great is that we could get the middle of that You know, I just wish that they had done that they had done that I wish and and canonical's got great engineers I'm gonna be wrong but but the the reason that I want to promote canonical and ebuntu is because Their products have always been You I mean to a fault. I mean snap comes to mind, right? Uh, have always been Like focused on usability above everything else Uh, if they over it I I happen to think that over engineering is a sign of a somebody you don't want to work with but that's There's there are people there are people there are engineers in this world And you know if you've been around for any amount of time there are engineers in this world Who think that the most over engineered complex solution is the best one because only smart people understand it And I cannot overstate How stupid that is and how that person those type of engineers should be weeded out and fired immediately The it is so complicated that the most brilliant people are the ones you can take a highly complex system And turn it into something that can be some simplicity Uh, uh lock ins are depressing My my we have a comment here. My actual and first job is pushing me towards learning open shift on top of already existing I've been products the lock ins are depressing. They are they're depressing and so look I had a choice in my home lab and in my personal life Uh to say look, I I do not need or want to learn red hat And and I don't want to stay current. I mean the argument for me to put it on there was hey I'm going to stay current. I'll be able to get a good job. I get my r.h.c. You know I'll be good to go if I want to be an infrastructure engineer And if you if you want to be an infrastructure engineer today I'm very sad to report that you cannot be one if you don't know red hat You have to know it But there is a certain percentage of jobs out there that people are hiring Hiring either container-based or dev ops or cloud native and there are some Big shops. I imagine I haven't seen any that actually use a bunch of server and I have a choice And my choice is to prepare for those jobs Even if that job is way way way harder for me to find and this goes for rusted go and I don't I just to compare it I you know, I had I once advised somebody who ended up getting a job in influx db doing go programming Get well some new rust Uh, I I told him point blank. I said, you know It you go for it. Go for it. Go. I you guys won't believe this about me But I actually encourage this guy to go find a rust job. I said, look, you you know, it's gonna you're gonna have to sacrifice You might have to move to germany. There's lots of like rust jobs in germany um But you know if if that's your real passion then you're gonna have to make a sacrifice and find a company that has it And he came in one day on his own to me without me saying anything He says I'm starting to think that I should learn go So I can get the job and then I can just have rust and do that on the side until it gets big And he got six how he got the job. That's exactly how he got the job Because in all of influx db isn't go except for flux the flux language, which is in rust They ended up getting a job working on that The point is that You don't have to pick Uh, the mainstream stuff esxi. I mean You know, you don't have to pick those things Uh, I'm gotten older So I my picks are largely in line and training you as largely in line with what's going to get you an immediate job But sometimes especially like right now You know, you have the choice to say You know, I don't need to give in on that for example If I want to use Linux on the desktop if you want to lose Linux on the desktop and you don't want to work anywhere That doesn't let you do that You can filter out 80 of the companies out there and you can say look I don't want to work for any company that is too stupid to not let me use Linux on my desktop And I used to I used to joke with my old manager. He's gone now. He left you retired But I used to joke with him after he hired me I was like, you know, if I had asked that one question I would never have taken this job because they forced me to use a macro windows And I after being using Linux on the desktop for 12 years And I adapted and I'm using vmware now and everything but But seriously if you're interviewing You can choose I guess that's the point I'm making you can choose to say No And you can there's never been a time when you could be more picky, especially if you're good You can say look, I I don't you know, no, you're gonna make me you're gonna make me use windows every day. Goodbye There's like, you know, 10 other people down the street that will hire me I mean, but you have to make your own decisions if you want to make your Chances for working in a place A lot of jesson qualifiers, you know, they use it on the server, of course Uh, and you know, but but you can you can do the same thing you can make a choice You can say I don't work want to work for any company that uses red hat servers Right, you can do that That's a very very very tiny list of companies that you'll work for and you'll be eliminating most of the fortune 500 Uh, but You can do it. You can do that. You know, it's your choice Uh, you could you could say, you know, whatever so that you anyway, um Uh, that that's kind of uh, that topic. Let me let me see if I can save some of these I mean, we do we were a little bit late. So I'll try to to bump bump through the rest of these questions really quickly A desktop too. Yeah Uh, why did I bend a proxmox? So People have been watching me do my uh, home lab and it stuff and uh proxmox I I did not know this when I got into it. I really wish I had I wrote a lot about it in my zed if you want to read it Uh, the the short answer is uh proxmox maximum that maximum nodes in a cluster is 32 Uh, I got the 14 nodes in my cluster and proxmox started falling on its face in ways that I won't go into detail on Uh, it just could not the coral sink could not keep everything updated Uh, I had caching problems because the icons were not getting refreshed properly And all the problems I was having were confirmed by tons and tons of forum posts on proxmox from the people having the same problem and uh, everybody Um That I ask who says proxmox works great for them. It has like less than five nodes usually just one node and and they use it So, uh, I mean I was already kind of leery of the whole afero gpl v3 license that proxmox was released under Uh, and the whole use of you know dependency on a web interface I mean, I did like it. It was it was super pretty Uh, but it's definitely not necessary. And so After I hit those problems, I was like now proxmox is out of here And and then another another problem too is that I noticed that all of my four gigabyte mac minis gave up 1.2 gigabytes of ram just to running the proxmox uh agent That's true story Just to run the proxmox agent Which which is I mean to run the base the base, you know virtual machine And then the proxmox agent on top of that took up 1.2 gigabytes of ram So I had about three gigabytes of ram left to do anything with really anyway I haven't done a comparison with uh a bunch of server I went ahead and put the full version of service to the minified version On my nodes at this point and I went ahead and reinstalled and put that on 19 different things So I'm going to be running a bunch of server on everything um, and then I'm going to be running kvm and live vert and vert manager from Uh, my main server directly and then also the vnc and stuff like that from it I don't really need anything to do that management I'm looking at like ansible to kind of help with that but after looking at it How problematic ansible is with the whole python thing? I'm actually thinking about making my own single binary agent That's compiled with bonsai that runs on the endpoints That does essentially what I did when I was at IBM and I wrote I wrote an entire infrastructure framework for audit compliance and security for 52 000 machines I'm thinking about doing the same sort of thing and go just as a fun project. It's a home lab That's what they're for and I absolutely hate all the solutions that are out there right now Because they require python virtual environments and they they over step in what they do to the Virtual machines and and if you still are running on on iron and you don't want to run under vm because you're going to take a 30% loss through your containers. That's another stat. I found I switched to kvm vert box from virtual virtual box. Did you really cool? And I I mean, I really think kvm is the way to go. I kvm is the basis for all major cloud providers now Uh, and it's it's going to be the future And so anything that I can do that plays in the kvm space Uh, it's going to be more relevant long term and it's also fun So I am going to be writing. I'm looking at salt right now, but that's also python and I was like, eh So I may be stealing some of the best ideas of these configuration management systems and creating one and go if one doesn't already exist and doing that I might actually resurrect fluff, which is um Was what I started some time ago to do this very thing to provision You know vm's really quickly and based on profiles and things like that But to do it on a local machine using, you know, your local installation of vmware Uh, I started out with virtual box We had three providers and they would do it locally if you had enough, you know prox But I think we could come back to the to the fluff thing and maybe come up with some sort of distributed thing as well And now we're like controlling things remotely as well. So, uh, if we do that, that'll be a bonsai branch It'll be fluff as a bonsai branch and then we'll be able to put that in your monolith And your bonsai is your monolith or whatever you want to do So that's that's all development that I plan to do over, you know When this whether gets colder and stuff and after I get my lab set up So if you want to watch any of that happening, it's going to be going for a while. Yes, it is a not invented here thing I'm making a mountain what I really don't understand is why there's not a better product in this space. That's a single binary Uh, the closest thing to it is terraform Which is just orchestration. I mean you can bend it's arm and make it do configuration management, but it's not designed for that Um, and there's no combination of configuration orchestration and and stuff like fabric which just runs remote Uh, you know, just run this one thing remote and give you back the results And I I I don't know why, um And I I feel like there's some area for innovation on that front Uh, what's the font? This is group. This is uh, ubuntu mono Yeah, it just looks good because I I adopted the group box So and and I run it at a pretty high Uh size so that you can read it from wherever Uh, what is your font about that? We under that. Um So the question should you should you try to run Linux on max of apples actually trying to keep it from happening? Uh The answer to this is Yes in your home lab So There's kind of two contexts for when you make a decision about what you want to run Linux on if you're picking hardware for any size organization Obviously, you're not going to buy max for that but If you are working for a school or somebody that has a bunch of old lab hardware Mac minis like mine or other old hardware and you don't have the budget to You know use the cloud or even have a good internet connection for god's sakes There are max errors. Yeah, but yeah, um, we were talking so Uh, yeah, they're 10 and they were on aix. Do you remember the 90s? In the 90s. Yeah, the power PCs. They're on aix. This is IBM tech So anyway, um Yeah, I can tell that people are not as interested. I have to say anymore that the viewers are dropping a little bit Uh, that's fine. I don't care. So you should try to run Linux on max. I I do think That if you Have an old mac and you want to breathe life into it again Because especially if it's been written off by apple who said we're not supporting that anymore Goodbye And and it has intel hardware, which is a lot of old intel and I said, yeah, hell, yeah Uh osx server. Yeah, the cheese grader mac pro And it has osx. Yes Uh, it's yeah, it does. Well, yeah, I mean they're Yes, the answer is yes. I I think you should run Linux on anything and everything And I have made a great hobby and passion of mine to do that. There was a time when I couldn't drop Five grand on a server and make, you know, the sweet corporate money now But there was a time when I was we're starting out and there's a lot of you out there watching right now who don't have that kind of money and you are You know at best in a in a dorm or you're trying to get it to run and you're trying to dual boot your mid laptops and stuff, right and to someone like that just having a server Of any kind having a separate computer to run Linux on is and use it as a server and leave it plugged into the wall it's a big deal and For many people they will find old hard. I had one guy who was the son of the director of tech for david's college And he had like thousands of dollars and left over hardware. It made me so sick but he just got so you know Linux Linux is I mean one part of the core ethos of Linux is Breathing new life into old hardware no matter what And you'd be surprised what people can put Linux on it's amazing Uh To be mean to viewers. Yeah, I can't be pretty mean so anyway, um So what I'm trying to say is that um Is that You should you should try to run on anything and don't let people put you down If you're running it on like a p2 Or you know some really ancient hardware because you know what you'd be surprised. This is another thing about Linux I never get tired of Dealing particularly when I was mentoring people directly one-on-one in person I don't get this I don't get this buzz as much as I used to because I don't deal with people and it's really annoying actually One of my I didn't get paid much when I ran my own company because I lower the rate really low So I can do the bare minimum And so one of the things that was valuable to me was being in person with somebody when they're learning this stuff All of the aha moments. Oh Oh I used to be present when they would have these moments and they were worth like a hundred dollars each to me They still are I miss it This is why I want to I want y'all to stream so I can get you know paid through watching you discover stuff because because Seriously, so One of those times there there is nothing better that okay So one guy actually brought in is another story one guy brought in I told him I said look if you look it goes I don't have a computer. I don't know where to go. I said I promise you Next time you're at a family gathering if you ask your family members If anybody has an old computer in the closet or the attic someplace that they're keeping because it's got old tax records on it Right, it's got old tax records on it and they're too afraid to give it to goodwill And I guarantee you there are tons of them if you go find those things and they say well, we don't want to give It's got tax records. Okay. Well or browser histories or something like that, right? You could you can go find it you will find one I promise you and you promise them that you will wipe that disc clean and that you will make it better and that you will put it to good use And I you would not believe how many free computers people can find In fact, it was such a thing. It was such a thing that we would actually start going through Neighborhoods we started putting together an affidavit that we could get legally signed and presented people so we could say Look, we are officially this is our official position on this. We're not begging We are taking your old computers cleaning them up and and Renewing them and giving them to people who don't have computers so that we can close the digital divide in our own country That is my primary goal with linux and if it if and if a company like red hat says we don't care what our Distro runs on do you see how offensive that gets to me because that's like red hat saying We really don't want to be a part of that We just want to cater to the enterprise. We don't care about all the linux efforts that are going on all over the world Uh to put computers and technology in the hands of people who don't have it to take old hardware and breathe new life in it Because the most pleasurable aha moment that you will ever hear Is somebody booting an old computer into windows 98 and I kid you not Looking it around at all the old netscape navigator stuff on everything And installing linux and watching it just cook as a server watching it run Fine as a server watching it be a hundred percent performant as a server because it's way more powerful than any the even a raspberry pi 4 Even though it's like 10 year old computer So instead of going to the trash heap or to someplace else This computer becomes A new toy and it's now in the corner of the garage or it's plugged in it's like really a slow ethernet You know And there's that so to me that's when you when you ask whether you should run an apple I think you should run on anything and I think the first time that you show somebody I mean look if you take away all that ugly gooey Right you're using a 10 year old computer right now exactly you take away all that ugly gooey stuff and you learn to use the terminal You would be blown away and you can run like the fish at max settings You know And if you're using vi you're not going to get any lag at all because it's vi vi's rate is supposed to work on 300 bond So, you know all of these things make using You know computers really fun again In fact, if there's one reason to try linux is it makes computing fun again Using linux makes computers fun to the right person Not everybody wants to use the terminal and see what they can do with all these important These kind of people by the way are the kind of people that will like You know like get a pair of wire cutters and strip down old serial cables and like cause them to control other electronics and shit like that And maybe they never did it before but they just want to experiment with that That's the kind of person that gets really into this kind of stuff Uh working with linux and open stack all day. Oh, you'll have to talk to us about open stack. I actually want to Uh open stack is all python unfortunately Uh, but I am thinking about learning open stack Uh, because I think open stack would be better than something like proxmox for even a home lab Uh, and by the way open stack, there's lots and lots of work in open stack Yeah, if you learn open stack, that's something that's an open source very very open source technology that is Um, but apparently they they're really really really bigoted about python Yeah, tony far reported that that he tried to commit some uh, some add some projects and go to the projects And they were denied because they weren't go And when I heard that I was like, oh, I don't know man I mean they're that into python, you know, they don't want to even consider other languages So I they're we're kind of on the cusp of a lot of other stuff Hey, how's it going south korea? Love having you. I love south korea. I cannot wait to go one day I want to go to south korea so bad it hurts Uh, pythonic is in nature. Yes, that's right. Yeah so Who bought all the pies? Uh, I have a few what did I change my title? Please tell me I did Okay, good. I guess I guess I didn't I thought I did I did that same thing I did before again Uh, I thought I changed the title. I didn't all right. Well, let's let's wrap up the stream here Singapore fantastic Oh, I love rancher desktop rancher, but it's got a problem um What is the data lake? I have no idea. What is a data lake? I am a nerd we talked about that already Yeah You go back and watch the watch the youtube video when I post it if you wanted a data lake is a centralized repository That allows you to store all your structure on structure data at scale You can store your data as is having to first structure the data Yeah I'm not a I'm not a fan of data lakes. Uh, you got it fair. I've been a relational database person my whole life Uh, if you look at like mongo db and a bunch of people that have tried to do object databases And you you see them fall on their face and end up, uh, deploying a relational database later Uh, you'll see the problem. I think you should start with relational relational database up front Uh, if you need a database if you don't need a database, you might be fine with just files actually Uh, I know that's heresy to say it, but um Yeah, I but I'm not I'm not a fan of that Uh, so yeah Corporate yes What do I think of web 3? I hate it. Uh, web 3 is disastrously poorly designed. Uh, it's horribly over engineered By extremely intelligent people who have no practical sense whatsoever And these are my worst type of technologists if I detect that type of technologist In real life, whether I'm working with them or I see them at a conference or at a pub I will do everything in my power to get out of the room and go somewhere far away from them Because yeah, SQLite exactly so um People who don't understand why web 3 is a bad idea Uh, are not thinking in practical terms. I I absolutely despise Engineers who are not practical Who do things because they can who like to pick technology because it's cool and because it's complex I despise technology for technology's sake um Yeah, I'll go swing in a hammock. I will this I Technology is serves one purpose of one purpose only and that is to enable life to be better and to go on and to You know and create harmony in the universe and and all of those things and any technology that just tracks from that Uh, especially if it's claiming to do that and it fails to hypocritically Uh, I don't want nothing to do with it and that's web 3 As web 3 that's NFTs. That's any of the crypto stuff Uh, am I opposed to people exploring the realm and see if it's a good way to secure exchanges between banks and stuff? possibly, uh I I'm just I'm just tired of of Impractical people applying their extremely intelligent brains to things and coming up with shit that makes no sense at all Uh, and by the way html was a bad idea myself, too I think html was a bad idea and to a lesser degree html was exactly this problem Markdown was plenty fine Why didn't they use it markdown was invented by writers Who wanted something practical html was invented by scientists So they immediately went to the other scientists and they said hey scientists Uh, what are you already using for like managing like data and stuff? We're using this sgml thing with some big ass acronym that doesn't make any sense to anybody and make some sound really important No markdown did not exist if it had in fact the knowledge exchange grid that I want to make Is markdown and Hugo's markdown, right? Yeah, Hugo's Hugo's a go tech so Markdown is relatively, you know, uh, by the way erin schwarz Uh, and uh, John Gruber made markdown John Gruber still has Uh, I think John Gruber has been he's so much of a writer and a podcaster They asked him a jgm who made pandog invited him to be in a you know involved and he's like nah And so jgms lost was like trying to document mark out good If you go read the itf rfc's on markdown, it's hilarious because there's no official markdown Specification at all and so they tried to come up with one and jgm was left This berkeley guy was left to come up with you know as close as he could come up with with a standard because markdown as Defined in the pearl script that jong made that erin helped him make by the way erin schwarz God knows he's one of my favorite humans who ever live um You know they they it's got tons of bugs and Inconsistency is a specification of jgm and very scientifically. He's like he's a philosophy professor berkeley He's like okay. We got to fix this so he gets in there And he tries to fix it all and he comes up with as much consensus as he can for common mark And he got github to sit at the table and reddit and a couple other people And they come out with the common mark standard which you know and get a flavor markdown as an extension of it now And so that's all been standardized But You know so look there does need to be a scientific approach to it But I I tell you that story because it's a perfect example of engineers screwing shit up They do it all the time engineers fix problems But they also create problems out of thin air Because they're engineers And I know because I've done it i've done it i've done it so many times Raise your hand if you've done it raise your hand if you've over engineered a solution And and you're like you come you go get some coffee you come back and you're like and you look at it you're like You mean I could oh my god or or here's a here's a better one. Here's a better one your wife, right? You're like you're like you're like going for a walk and you don't have a twitch stream to torment with all of your ideas, right? Yeah, and you're like and you're and you're talking to your you know you're talking You're like tormenting your wife with like technical knowledge, right? It's just trying really hard because she loves you to understand what you're saying And she's trying to follow you because she loves you and you try to follow her art stuff and everything And and out of nowhere. She says well, what if you did this? I mean, I mean she's like, you know, I'm not a techie or anything But what if I just what if you just did that instead and you're like, oh my god You're a genius Oh Yeah, you know it's like So uh-oh you're gonna come in and comment on that I'm I'm just wrapping up. I was just telling him how you have to have somebody who asked why are you doing it that way? Ooh beef uncured hot dogs Mark wallberg is making hot dogs now. He has a whole restaurant thing going on. Okay Can you turn the last thing? Well, actually I need to talk about tech How many things is that break? Why does this why couldn't this just be simple? Why did I have to make my documentation website use javascript? IBM I post that on twitter today Seriously, all of all of IBM's documentation site requires javascript to read it. Ask yourself How come that's a bad idea? So So Web three to me and I did answer the question. What do you think of web three? I think web three is the epitome It's like if you took all the people if you took Like like the whole rick and morty idea where you can separate the toxic cells from the good self, you know If you were to take all of the toxic Overengineers self from every engineer and you were to put that in a big vat of actual, you know goo in rick and morty style And you were like have it like take on some sort of like nebulous form that could communicate It would create web three Because that's what it is web three is the absolute worst possible design from the most over engineered impractical Frankly idiotic perspective you could ever imagine and and I that's all I have to say about that It makes me really happy that At least I have my feet on the ground and that sometimes I'm actually happy that I'm dumb Compared to some of these other engineers because it causes me to think things through more I I can't you know spit out, you know Uh complexity theory algorithms or do land to calculus, you know at lunch. I'm not that guy. I can't do that. So I'm glad sometimes because it keeps my feet on the ground and it makes me think through things Um and and think and ask questions like why are all these dashes in all of our command lines? Get off get off this as a good example of over engineered crap You know when somebody created a a user interface that was an engineer is like we'll put one dash here for this We'll put two dashes here. We'll allow colon for this And that's why I made bonsai because I am a practical person I don't like when people over engineer stuff and one of the most over-engineered things ever is get-up. So That's a little rant about that. Um No experience with snort and nips or nids. I wish I did. I'm super sorry. I can't talk about that Uh This is just the whole idea of looking at logs all the time and studying those and combining them all That's been around since the days of like, um centralized, um Uh system log, uh daemons, but it's still a thing. I still think it should be done. Um, what is nips I don't know what nips is network intrusion detection system Umbrella term for combination of hardware and software. That's cool. I like the concept from what I understand of it Um Is the system that attempts to detect hacking activities to now have service attacks I think these things are cool. I really do. Uh, I don't have anything I don't my is just old school tripwire. We would just like check some every file on the whole system make lists of of um Exceptions and then watch for things to change Uh security is actually a lot simpler than most people make it out to be Kind of in that practical sense all you really have to do to ensure a system is secure is track everything on the system and tell you when anything changes You don't have to have fancy signatures It can be gotten around by compiling the same malware and go that was in c before You don't have if you just look for things on the system that are regularly changed And and create ways to detect those changes in the system Uh and report on them that that is the number blue one blue team approach that I think everybody should be doing And I don't know that's how I caught the hacker who invaded my computer at home back when I set up my own mail server Um, and that's how everybody It should be doing it. I don't understand why it's so so hard Uh the defender defeater Yeah What is eldep and I should use it so eldep is a lightweight directory access protocol. This is uh something came from the 90s that was used to Uh put group information for corporations and stuff and it is still used a lot. Um, it's used in We've talked about it before we talked about it with uh, I want to say hayden And uh with free IPA and some things like that. It's built into active directory now as of may as of may 2022 Um, and it's the way that you get group permissions Once a person authenticates to see if they can do things if you can authorize them to do different things Uh, I think everybody should use it. It should be a part of your system Uh in your identity management and how you do things. Uh, we will be putting open eldep on my lab here Um, probably in the form of free IPA. Although I'm I'm a little bit leery of free IPA now now that I've been looking back at nis, which is really old tech Uh, but I want to see if there's something related to that before I make a decision right now I'm just doing localized logins on everything and which is more zero trustee because it does use search for all that Uh eldep is not a windows thing. No eldep is getting if you do a search for eldep You're going to get a lot of hits for azure and active directory these days because that's usually where people are run Or they're deploying it. Uh, but it's actually way older than that Yeah on linux, it comes. Yeah, linux eldep has kerberos built into it Kerberos is the name of the three headed dog Greek dog that was guarding whatever and Is mit technology designed to do password authentication without ever sending passwords over the over the wire By exchanging data that's been signed using public key cryptography So kerberos is the standard. Uh, even if you're not using it outright You're using it inside of other things. It's kerberos is is built into pam for example and linux se and And eldep and everything else. It's just not always front in the center Uh, yeah the tickets that nobody really understands exactly Uh, if you're familiar with wire shark, you can be familiar. Yep. It's another one. Yeah, and you can watch eldep over the wire too. Um These days eldep is secured and you know over encrypted connections, but not always Um, but most of the time these days eldep is used to give information about an account Uh regarding, you know, what things this authorized to do and what it can do Uh roles will say role-based authentication. I mean authorization Um, but it and it can be used for authentication the first part that says i am me Uh, but that i am me thing, uh, is now Taking place elsewhere in kerberos and other things that are um And then eldep is provides the other data They get that right Uh, it's still useful and not over engineered. I think public key cryptography is not at over engineered at all I think I think it's actually the only natural way to do it Um Uh, it's the other things you call smart are harmful. No, absolutely not No, and there are some things that have to be complex cryptography is one of those things Um, and I you know and I accept that right? Uh, I I don't think cryptography can be Although I mean you can make the argument that some of the cryptographic algorithms failed because of over engineering If you I I'm not going to get into it But if you like short like the failure of blowfish or rsa or any of the other ones that are no longer officially good, you know Uh, you might you know uncover the fact that somebody was getting really clever and their cleverness ended up being their downfall um But you know, we do need cleverness. Don't get me wrong. So I yeah Uh, does does how to I mean my favorite xkcd about this is Uh, you guys know the xkcd about the password thing. It's a perfect example of this over engineering concept That seems to be the theme today. Um, does anybody have a link to it? I'll go find it xkcd Uh password. It's it's one of the most popular pass rots Here it here it is, right? Wait. Oh troubadour common substitutions. You're risk No, that's not it. Where is it? That's not it Any enigma Too coffee just enough to use it effectively. Yes, it was um Dang it Where's the one you guys know what I'm talking about? password Uh pass rod actually pass for encryption If you know what it's the next kcd about the encryption thing I'm trying to find it. I can't it's taking me forever because I'm slow Or is it you just have to look for a club Yes Or is it I love it. I love it. I can't find it I'm gonna I'm gonna spend all day trying to find it if I can't find it. You guys can try to help me find it It's the one where he talks about his algorithm Uh for defeating defeat cryptography how to defeat Uh password cryptography Ah It's actually it's actually a joke about it and and and mr. Robot Oh, here it is. Yeah, this is the one Okay, so Here we go A crypto a crypto nerd's imagination His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a multi-million dollar cluster to crack it. No good. It's 40 96 bit rsa encrypted Blast our evil plan is foiled What would actually happen his laptop's encrypted drug him and hit him with the five dollar wrench until he tells us the password Got it This this is my favorite because this is exactly how This is engineers over here, right? And this is like practical dumb people Threat models are a thing they are a thing you know and You know, it's like you spend like multi-billion dollars on the door and the wall next to it is two by fours and drywall You know It's like But then they don't think about it. This is this is a pretty common meme out there. By the way, they're not dumb, right? Uh, they're not so you see engineers Yeah, I mean you know, it's And I think that this problem comes about because people overthink Uh The technology either because it's exciting to them because they really get off on mathematics or something or Some other reason I don't know why but they they don't accidentally lock ZQ says accidentally locked my keys inside a calm closet today Then I realized the door was on backwards. So I just took a piece of metal in there and I'm probably a vulnerability Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to tell you Yeah, you know, it's fun. It's it's fun to talk about. It's horrible when I when you experience it So as I seems to be kind of the theme today, I hope I hope no one gets overly Been out of shape on my picking on engineers I am one and I am the first one to tell you that I've made tons and tons of mistakes Uh, because I overthought something and some of these projects I threw away Do you guys remember that parser that I made where I made my own sco sub language to do all the parsing? And I was like, why don't I just like go? I mean, I totally threw the whole thing away I threw like three weeks of work and an entire documented Subline sub go api for this language that I had created and I chucked it all And I I replaced it with like a one rune Uh character scanner instead And and then code did code generation when necessary and I was like, oh my god. What was I thinking? And you know, we're going to go through those times. That's just human progress But you know and I really shouldn't beat people up for over engineering things until they get like all You know white towery, you know, ivory tower about it. It's like you're going to use what we give you and you're going to like it And people get like that. I have lose my patience uh A lot of over engineering actually comes from corporate and management not from mentors themselves. I agree Uh, let me give you an example of that one fun one fun. Uh Uh, the crypto web three job you experienced it first hand really So let me give you an example of that the engineer the management screwing stuff up. Okay This is a true story from my buddy brent who worked in the military I taught him linux, uh, you know back in the day He had taught me salaris and he was kind of my mentor. I was the first official system of a job I had I had been doing web development. I was like his webmaster before that This was my first actual job, you know managing salaris and aix and everything and He told me a story once that we used to play chess and and and eat and talk stories because it's just a big job Uh At lunch and he told me the story once about how it's and I've told the story before his senior officer Uh, he he did all the work to spec out a salaris, uh server And he got the best one possible for the job and it cost like 20 50 000. It was like really spending Um, but it was small And if you know anything about technology, you know that if you want small you pay more money Right And so, I mean it was barely the size of like a for you tower today, right? But uh, we do have questions but not right now We're about out of time We are out of time But if you want to you can give me a question we can put in for tomorrow Or you can come on in and leave the questions in our discord in the questions conversations and advice channel Economy of scale, right? So so, I mean everybody in the it world knows that Smallest better You know if you can keep the heat down everything So no joke his senior officer said I have my commanding officer is coming in i'm giving him a tour And that will not do they're going to be here in two weeks. You need to do something about this news Like what do you want me to do? And he's like, I don't know it just needs to be bigger Very male american military thing to say And he said, uh Well, we could get a rack for it and we could get it like a we could get like a We could get like a rack for it like a like a 42 u rack for it and put it in that He goes is that bigger and he's like, well, yeah I mean that would be like, you know 13 feet in the air and you just put the in there and we just close the door on it And he's like I want that I Want that His senior officer no kidding his senior officer Commanded him to spend an extra 300 dollars like a delrack or whatever to put his like four five u server in that cost like 20 50 thousand dollars And you know, he's like, okay I'm sure it was and you know, we were just riffing and he was like, oh, you know, I can put some lights on it I Yeah, it's the kind of outlets suspension on step 150. I know You know when he got victorious like see this is our new computer, which we just which we just purchased, you know And brent's been here brent's been instrumental in getting the server for us in front of brent I just love brent brent. I I wish I could get brent on the stream brent is the most Stoic human being I have ever known He's hilarious. He's so hilarious. He never cracks jokes. He's just really smart I I can see his mustached face today. He's the kind of guy Who just doesn't talk But when he does say stuff, it's really funny. It's really interesting and I just I will never forget that story I miss him so much. He was such a great I mean, I know, you know, it's hard to you know, you you get people that you work with that are great friends And I I just really I really miss having having him around and and letting me like transom and and Vera, how are you? Wow? Speaking of having fun friends around Good to see you my friend. Please don't dox anything about yourself in the moment. This is going on youtube We are just about ready to wrap up Uh, my my good friend Vera is here. Uh So we will we'll be catching up in a bit So stop by the youtube channel Uh, stop by the twitch channel if you want to watch me making a lab I can't wait to hear all the things i'm doing wrong from Vera my friend, uh about my server I'm sure that everyone's going to have an opinion on that. I've gotten used to it though So It'll be fun Talk to you later youtube Stop", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.6, "text": " Okay, start. There we go.
