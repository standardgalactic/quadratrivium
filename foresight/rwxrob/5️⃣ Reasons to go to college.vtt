00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Should you go to college? Whether you are young or old, the decision to go to college is a huge one.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.000
I already did a video on whether you should go to college or not.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
The answer is probably yes, particularly in America, and in Europe it's free, right?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
But in America you have to weigh the cost benefit and all of that.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
But there's really five reasons to go to college, and the truth is if you can accomplish those things,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
if you can do those things that you get from college in other ways,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
and I'm going to share a couple stories of people who have done this,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
then I don't think college is as required, and I'm not the only one saying that.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
There are a lot of people who are not just old people, but young people who are now saying,

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
I don't need to go into massive debt in order to accomplish those five things.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
So what are those five things? We are going to do H&L, CSS, yes.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
So what are the five things?

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
The first thing is obviously people go to college to get a job.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Now that doesn't necessarily, that's not usually the first reason to go to college that people go.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
They don't even think of that, and usually they'll pick a major like psychology,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
which I actually helped someone actually get a job after they got a major in psychology

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
because they couldn't get work.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm not bagging on psychologists, I'm just saying that if you want a job,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
you've got to get a degree that's going to get you a job.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I have a Russian degree, I actually had a job in Russia,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
but my wife told me she didn't want to be in Russia anymore,

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
so I had to re-skill, and I had to use a bunch of the things that I learned on my own in the computer lab

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
as a linguist in the computer lab and also by building out my own home lab

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
without going to college at all and continuing to go to college.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
So the number one reason is to get a job.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Now you can definitely qualify, you can learn the skills to get a job without going to college.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I made a whole video about why computer science might not be the right choice for you.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Computer science is definitely the right choice for certain professions,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
but not the ones you think.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
If you want to work for a Silicon Valley or any company that's doing tech things

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
that's going to pay you a tech salary,

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
you're probably not going to want a computer science degree, honestly.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
You're probably going to want the skills that you would get

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
shooting to get a certification like a Red Hat certification,

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
or one of these is there's another video of me drinking while talking about the Red Hat certification

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
because I really hate that the system and ComTA and all the certs that are out there

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
that you can get to supplement your college.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Some of them are cheaper than that.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
They're also not necessary to get a job.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
And so another story, some time ago, I believe it was in 2013,

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
IBM made a very public statement about that they don't require anybody to have a college degree.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
And they made a big deal of it and they showcased a few people,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
one of whom got a security job for IBM at 18 without having anything.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
They had a lot of knowledge.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
I think that person may have actually had a security certificate of some kind,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
but the point that IBM was making and many other big companies did around 2013, 2014,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
that was a long time ago, was that you didn't need college.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.000
And there's been overwhelming evidence that you still need to go to college to get a job,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
which brings us to the second point.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
So IBM created a system called K-16, which was this educational system

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
that took you all the way through the first couple years of college,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
and then you just would go through that and then you would,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
and I don't even know where that landed.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I don't know if there's a million.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
But the second main reason to go to college is to get a job.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I mean, it's to actually make more money at your job,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
and that is statistically borne out by the science.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm going to refer to Adam Ruins College.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Please go watch the video about this.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
It talks about, yes, at every stage in their careers,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
people that went to college made 30% more in America,

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
and generally enjoyed better opportunities because they went to college.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I hate reporting that statistic.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I hate it because it shouldn't make any difference.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
If you have the skill, you should be paid for that skill, the end.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And so that's the second reason, to make more money,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
to get a job and to make more money.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Those are not the first two reasons that people cite to go to college.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Most of them, they cite it while they want the third one,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
which is to find yourself, to discover what it is you want to be,

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
to smell the roses and figure out what it means to be a thinker,

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
to take philosophy classes, to get high or get drunk

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
and figure things out or to write poetry or to do whatever.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
People use college as an opportunity of self-discovery,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
and it's very expensive to do that.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
To go to college, to pay $3,000 or $4,000 a semester to find yourself,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
it's an extremely expensive way to do that.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Take a gap year.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
In fact, some colleges that are more responsible than others

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
have gone so far as to say,

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
you can take a gap year and we will pay you a scholarship

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
for you to take a gap year before college even starts.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
So you can figure it out what you want to be, who you are,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
what you believe.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
There's a huge debate in the larger culture world

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
about the value of a college education, particularly now in 2024

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
when there's all kinds of radical things happening on college campuses

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
because college campuses have traditionally been the places where progress happens.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
That's where people are testing the boundaries.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
They're testing interpersonal boundaries,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
they're testing their societal boundaries,

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
and they're discovering things.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Some people would cite that that's the number one reason to go to college,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
and that's why we have to have colleges.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
We have to have places where people can go and think and not care.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Not care about the bill that they're going to get

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
or the fact that they might lose their job.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Tenured professorships is one of the worst things that ever happened in the world

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
because these people don't have to worry about accountability at all

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
because they have a job no matter what.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
When is that ever a good idea?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I don't think that's a good idea.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
So finding yourself, who you want to be,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
what is your career going to be, what are you going to do with your life,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
that is the third reason.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
That's usually one of the main reasons that people go.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Along with that, who are you going to meet along the way?

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
This includes your potential life partner, particularly Mormon.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
If you're a Mormon, there was a joke, a running joke saying,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
if you're a Mormon, you're going to go to college

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
because that's where you're going to meet your spouse.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
So women who are not encouraged to get education,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
they would go there to find a husband, they'd find their husband,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
they'd drop out of school, and then they'd go back later in life.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
It's absolutely abysmally bad, it's a horrible thing.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Because education for women is kind of downplayed,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
they've since kind of come around on that,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
but the point is connections.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
You're going to college to create connections.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Some of those connections are going to be lifelong friendships.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Some of them are going to be potential job opportunities.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I mean professors, right?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Some of the friendships that I have made with professors

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
while I was in college have gone on to be some of the most valuable things

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
in my entire life, and I cannot say it any other way.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Some of the people that I met in college, the same sort of thing.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Of course I met my wife in college.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
So the people that you meet in college are going to be

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
some of the most important people you're ever going to meet.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Again, it's a very expensive way to meet people.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
And I'm going to come back to that point

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
by telling some stories about alternative ways to do these different things.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
And the fifth thing is to learn how to do your laundry.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
To put it bluntly, you've got to learn how to adult.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
You've got to be a grown-up.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
You've got to take care of your laundry,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
whether you decide to live in your car or an apartment or whatever.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
You've got to learn to do your dishes,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
whether it's you only have one fork, one knife, and one spoon

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
so that you never have dishes piled up like I had to do because

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
otherwise nobody would ever do the dishes.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
You've got to learn to get along with people that you're roommates with.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You have to be a grown-up.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
You have to learn how to manage your life.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
You've got to do your finances.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
You have to understand what it means to buy something,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
to buy your first computer on credit

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
so that you can build your credit in America,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
so that you can survive in America because you have to have credit.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
There's a professor, a good friend of ours,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
who went her whole life without buying anything on credit

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
and she can't do anything.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
She almost couldn't get a mortgage

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
because she was so responsible with her money the whole time

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
because she's not playing by the capitalist system.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I don't care if you like it or not.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I hate it.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
That's just the rules of the rules of the game.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So knowing the rules is half the battle.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
So let's talk about some alternatives to doing those five things.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
So to conclude primarily before we go out to the next part,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
it's really important that you say to yourself,

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
okay, college has become the most convenient for many people,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
albeit expensive, college is the most convenient way

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
to do all five of those things.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
They've got a dorm set up for you to help you learn how to adults.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
They've got resident assistants to help you know

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
where to go get your vaccinations when you need it.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
They've got all kinds of weird things.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
College campuses, since the dawn of time,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
since the dawn of college campuses,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
have been set up to meet the needs of those five things.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And it's extremely convenient for most people.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
It's also very, very expensive.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
But why would knowing about those five things on their own be relevant?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Okay, so let's give you a couple of examples.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
One of them is getting the skills to get a job

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
and getting more money to get a job,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
getting the credentials that are going to get you money to get the job,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
and maybe meeting people that would get you a job, right?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Let's talk about those three things.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
There's other videos on this,

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
but let's say I'll do another video on online universities, right?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
But when you talk about a college experience,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
the general college experience, I went to football games,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
I had all the thing, is that, you know,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
it's the opposite of an online degree.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
If you go get an online degree from an accredited institution like WGU,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
and there's a separate video on that,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
then you are not having many of those five experiences, right?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
But you're spending a lot less money.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
So one of the ways to do the first three,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
to make more money and get a skilled job skills,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
and me people are going to get you a job,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
is to go to an online university,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
which is way, way, way cheaper,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
or focus on getting credentials or doing whatever else it takes

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
to establish trust that you can do the job.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Those are things you can do on your own.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
If you took the cost, this is a true story.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
So my son went to a community college,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
computer science 101 course,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
and there's 85 people in the room or something,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
and they asked him to raise his hand,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
and they said, does anybody here have any programming experience?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
And he raised his hand,

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
because he had already completely learned how to code in Python and Go.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
He'd made several applications in Go on the back end,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
and in actually JavaScript as well.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
So, I mean, he knew how to code.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
He had proven, he had built online interactive WebSockets based games

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
with all of the components of programming in that realm.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
So he had a lot of, I mean, the fundamentals of programming

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
that were taught in CS101, he had a lot of them.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And then he proceeded to raise his hand.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
He was the only kid in the class who raised his hand.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
He went up and talked to his professor at the end

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
and said, is there any way I can test out of this class?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And they said, no, I'm sorry.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
So he paid $2,000 for a course that covered material he already had.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I have another story about this.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Gabe, if Gabe out there,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Gabe taught himself assembly when he was 16.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
He ordered his own circuit boards that arrived via DHL from China

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
that he designed on SOLIDWORKS himself while he was with me,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
while he was doing beginner booth stuff.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
He literally had his pick of colleges,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
and when he went to his first college,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
he had to take CS, whatever, to teach computer engineering,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
and he ended up teaching the assembly class.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
He paid $2,000 for the privilege of being the unpaid TA for that course.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
And then he immediately became the TA.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
He applied to be the TA, and he became the TA next.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
He became the TA for the course, and now he's teaching all the play.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
He was in the class. He knew everything.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
He knew everything in the course, and he was totally frustrated,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
but he's like, whatever.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
He paid all this money because the system wasn't set up to let him say,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
oh, I already know this, right?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
So there's a couple of takeaways from that.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
The first one is, you can learn any skill that's taught in college.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
You can learn any skill that will get you.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
In fact, some skills that they won't teach in college, many.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
MIT very famously has a thing called the Lost Semester,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
where they teach you how to use desktop Linux, among other things,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
because it's not included as a part of the curriculum,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
because it's not serious enough.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It's totally stupid.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And the point is, is that you can learn those skills other ways.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
You can make more relationships with other people in other ways,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and you can do it for on the cheap way better.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
So WGU is another one of these universities where you can learn all those things.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Now WGU is going to leave you hanging on the other two things.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
You're not going to meet as many people through WGU bottom line.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It's not happening.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's not going to be as society.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
You're probably not going to meet your spouse at WGU, right?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
You might make a business contact or two, but probably not.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
So that means you're going to need to actively go out to meetups

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
and do the things that you have to do throughout your career.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Anyway, might as well get started before college.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
In fact, one of the biggest complaints I have about college

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
is that because it so conveniently covers all five of those things,

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
when people leave college, they don't know how to do those things outside of college.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
But if you focus on preparing relationships at local meetups,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
knowing what conferences to go to,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
knowing who to hang out with,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
building a group of professional peers and friends,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
really a professional learning network,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
if you're doing those things which you should be doing already,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
then you've already learned the skill,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and you haven't had to pay any money to college to learn it.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
You haven't become dependent on the college to cover that.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
And the colleges have an entire ecosystem of dependency

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
because they keep pumping in the whole alumni thing,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
give us more money, come back as an alum,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
help other people who go to this college

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
because you like our college better than all the other colleges, right?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
No.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I think it's a mistake for many people.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
So those are the five things.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
So if you go to WGU, how are you going to meet those other two needs?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Learning how to do your own laundry?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And what was the other one?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Making money throughout your career?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Meeting other people, I think.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Learning how to adult is the thing.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
The best way to do that, and I'm going to share a story here,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
the best way to learn how to adult and to meet other people on,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
oh, no, discover yourself, discover who you want to be.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
So I have a story from somebody that is indirect that I read some time ago.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It was about a woman who went to college.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
She went to Harvard.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
She graduated in Harvard.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
And I don't remember her degree.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
And she wrote an article, I believe it's on Medium,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
that said everything, the most important things I learned,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I didn't learn from college.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
And it's pretty much, the summary of it is,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
she went bureau packing.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
She went, you know, backpacking in Europe

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
and living on the total cheap.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
And she just accounts, she just recounts all of the

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
really life-changing experiences that happened to her

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
while she was just walking around Europe,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
meeting different people, staying in hostels,

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
getting to know, you know, others,

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
and also thinking about what she wanted to be,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
who she was going to be, what she was going to do with her life,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
and a lot of time to think and stuff.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Some people do Appalachian trails.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Some people live out of their car and travel across the country.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
You know, there are lots of opportunities to discover yourself

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
that do not have college impact.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
And I would suggest that college is probably one of the worst places

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
for you to discover yourself.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
It's a great place to be exposed to new ideas,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
ideas that you might not have been exposed to

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
because you didn't know about that book,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
or you didn't know who Joseph Campbell was,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
or you didn't know, I mean, there's a million things

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
that you may not have known.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
But if you learn early, maybe after watching this video,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
that you can build yourself an autodidactic learning plan,

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
that includes reading and learning about the things

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
that constitute the bulk of self-discovery at college.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
You can do it.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
You can make your own self-discovery course,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
or your own thing.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And it can include interactions with others.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It can include traveling the world.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
And it's going to be way, way, way cheaper than a study abroad.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Story about that, when I did study abroad,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I was like, I don't have the money.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I was working three jobs to get myself through college,

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
and this was in the 90s.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I don't know how people go to college now, right?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
And I was working three jobs.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I was like, I don't have money to pay $4,000

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
to go on a Russian study abroad.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
So you know what I did?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I was like, let me see if I can find a job.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
So I found a job.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I found and got a job being an American,

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
being a Russian cruise translator,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
which I later kept growing that job.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Got a lot of experience in Russia.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
It was one of the most proficient Russian speakers

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
in my entire Russian department

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
because I was making money working in Russia.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
And I didn't have to do a study abroad for that.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
So I got paid to go to Russia.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
They paid to go to Russia.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
You know what a lot of those people who did a study abroad did?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
They would go to Russia, and because they didn't,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
usually they weren't paying themselves, by the way.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
There was somebody else who was paying.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
They would go to Russia.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
They would go with their American roommate.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
They would travel all around.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
They'd speak English the whole time.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
They wouldn't learn anything.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So they would be $4,000 lighter.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
They'd come back.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
They didn't have any Russian skill.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
And they had no other experiences to talk or to speak of.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Meanwhile, I came back and I had a lot of real solid experience

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
teaching people English, teaching them business skills,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
and learning how to do the whole thing in general.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
So the point of it is if you're going to be able to do this long term,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
you need to really have a plan,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
and that plan should include self-discovery at a regular time.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
You don't need college for that.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
And whatever techniques you learn to find yourself,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
such as yoga or going on a bike trip,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
you should be doing that anyway, right?

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
You should be learning those skills anyway.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
So don't necessarily have to go to college for that.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Even if you do go to college, figure out what that is.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
I don't need a field trip in my Russian honors class

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
to show me Arches National Park

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
so that I can basically get Mormon stoned

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
and recite poetry under an arch in southern Utah.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
I can do that all on my own.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I don't need to pay money for that, right?

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
So that's what I would suggest.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And hopefully that's been a summary

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
of whether you should go to college or not,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
and what are some of the things.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
This is a really tough decision,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
and the decision about whether to go to college or not

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
is fundamentally colored by those five things.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Go ahead and review those for yourself.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
And let me know what you think.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Put it in the comments.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
That's just my idea that I've had with others

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
as we've talked about whether they should go or not.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
And I do think that most people should get a college degree,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
and I'll do another video on that

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
about how to get the college degree as cheap as possible

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
if that works for you and your career plan.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
And you should have that plan

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
before you even think about going to college.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I know it's crazy.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Can you imagine actually knowing what you want to be in life

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
before you go to college?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
It can be done. I've seen it.
