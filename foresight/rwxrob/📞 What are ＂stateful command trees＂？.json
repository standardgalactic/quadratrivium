{"text": " So, I just want to make a quick YouTube video about this because it seems to be coming up and it's a really important topic and I don't know how to make it into a question so I mean the question I originally was going to have was, what did I just do, you know like I don't know. What are contextual rooted command trees? And this is my new term. We thought, Milesi's not here, he's one of our community members who told me the idea that people were referring to this by saying fluid and fluid APIs or fluid command line APIs and I have not found any reference for that yet. So, Milesi if you're out there, let me know and put a comment in there, does anybody on YouTube who knows about this who's got an actual term for this? So I'm going to describe what it is and I'm going to use my best way of describing it which the community and I have recently just kind of come up with, you know I'm a little bit out of the idea but and I'm going to tell you what it is and then we're going to come up with a name for it because this is really becoming spectacularly popular and so we're seeing, so let me just summarize what's happening, let me tell you a little story, so you know if you go back to the Boomer days, you know a lot of good things came from the Boomers, the Internet, you know C, Unix, bunch of other stuff but one of the horrible things that came from the Boomer generation is stuff like this, GPG, this is the epitome of Boomer get-opt hell and I can sit here and hold my finger down and I can, you can see all of the potential options for like, you know good 60 seconds there and all of those things have dash dash and everything else right and it's absolutely horrible and in fact there is other programs that still use this, Cube CTL being one of them, so I mean they do have kind of a top level of contextual thing but beyond that right you're like, you know it does kind of give you contextual stuff a little bit right so but you still have like a ton of options to deal with and it becomes so unwieldy that you know you just, you can't do it, you have these top level commands and then but beyond that you're you're relegated to command hell with dashes okay so so so if you go back to the 70s when people had you know constraints on memory and everything this thing called get-opt was invented right and get-opt is the thing that from which all of the modern command lines that were not modern but you know semi-modern command lines have used it's the idea of having a switch with a dash or two dashes and there's varying and there's competing things and this entire hellish world that we live in that's that where everything has to have dashes in front of it is finally dying and I can I can I just tell you how happy I am that this is dying so you know I have a mantra don't get mad get busy and I was so annoyed by this entire thing and I built bonsai and this question isn't about bonsai I'll talk about that another day but if you go to mygithub.com slash rbxrob so bonsai is my my way of dealing with this and it basically makes very elegant contextual rooted command hierarchies or rooted command trees and so instead of having all of these dashes like my z command you just do z dot tab tab and you get a number of composite command trees I call them bonsai trees or bonsai branches and by the way you can import them very easily just by with one import command from go which is one of the reasons I love go and and then you can also create alternative pass through the rooted node graph which is the data structure we're using here and this bonsai bonsai is something that came about for me completely independent without knowing any of these other products that are doing the same thing so let me give you an example so if I go to you tab tab for unique I tap again and I get all these variations on on uniqueness right and you know I can type hex oops let's do iso sec iso sec you know like oh my god that's like too much to type well you can create a shortcut through that if you want to that's just you can create shortcut commands that that that zoom right down to the bottom level the contextual thing and then you deal with switches and stuff you know like whether you want your output in yaml and things like that all of those things you might actually be able to justify a switch for are now stateful and and so that means like if I have a command that that needs to say okay I prefer yaml as my output then we have like var and we have a thing called var and we have a thing called config and you can save those things in a stateful contextual way that sticks into your home directory and that's all built in and those are you don't have to put that into your monoliths but you can do so those are and by the way this approach that I do with bonsai is is elsewhere so let me let me give you an example so even Qubectl has a hint of this right so Qubectl tab tab you get all these options right but if you go Qube config right when Qubectl config like wow look at all these other commands right and so then we're going to do available commands wait what happened all right so get get context so Qubectl is kind of doing the same thing right but so but it still has dash dash current and all these are the things that you have to add right but I didn't want to bring this up I'm only I only have one context right now if you're if you're so this is an I this is an example of stateful contexts entering into the mainstream and it's not just here you're having more and more commands that that are expecting they're providing like a default context or state and I mean this this is revolutionary when it comes to like you know what we used to do the idea that your that a specific command like Qubectl or anything would have state that's stored in your home directory that you can then change rather than dealing with this switch every time I mean because the answer to this up to this moment has been right a bash script or something like that that's got all of the particular you know options that you want in there and or an alias or something right I mean let me give you an example so so so so LS right so LS my LS command is actually LS dash H color equals auto color equals auto if LS had been written to be a stateful you know command then these kind of things would automatically be stored in a in a sort of standard way within the home directory of the user rather than as an alias right with these crazy ass you know human readable thing like and if we actually did this kind of thing more frequently we would have the ability to transfer our preferences in a single file or directory dot under dog configure dot local or cash in like that so this is I'm think I'm thankful to say that this is where the universe is going thank God is that we are allowing state to be added to even things as granular as LS rather than create these aliases and stuff and we see that in Cube CTO when we do Cube CTO config you know we could change the context and all our commands are based on that namespace or based on that preference or but unfortunately we can't set our default output format that would be fantastic wouldn't it how many of you would like to change your output format for Cube CTO to default to wide probably a lot of you or to YAML or to JSON you probably want for this for the for the duration of the session to change that instead of having use that fucking switch on every single time you go back into your history and go edit it no amount of Z shell or fish you know assistance on the command line is going to overcome the bad design that forces you to put that switch on every fucking command line every time if that had been turned into a stateful configuration parameter I'm sorry I'm swear I normally don't do that on YouTube but this stuff gets me very angry yeah pain would have a config if if if we if we you know dare to give ourselves permission to give all commands state and context and rooted you know command trees the world would become a better place and I'm again I'm very grateful to report that this is already sneaking into our world let me show you a few examples so the first one I know of is get the first substantial program to violate the one one thing you know do one thing well idea was get and and ironically get still fulfills that get is just a front end there's actually a ton of commands in here so you can get add I mean it used to be multiple commands right so the old days of doing one thing well and and I mean that still applies that that that refactoring into one thing well but but in you know 2022 we've allowed ourselves to say look we have memory we have this space it's okay to put these one thing well things inside of monoliths that travel around and that's what bonsai is by the way and and then that way we know we have the portability of it all but we bring all of that functionality with us so and I mean busybox did this very thing and you guys ever seen busybox every single command from the from unix all of all the base units commands we've been this is not new right it's been used it's been it's been multicoll binaries before but busybox busy you know let me do a Docker thing so Docker you some people might not know this actually I have podman on here let me see if this doesn't work a podman dash it dash dash run I mean how how annoying is it that I have to type all that right isn't it I mean I am running podman so frequently with these parameters that I would want that to be my default context but I can't do that right it drives me crazy why can't I tell podman or docker that by default I want to remove the things after I run them I have to type dash dash rm every fucking time because it has no sense of state it should it should and I might actually redo a podman that has it that way but unfortunately no so it still has a command so I'm going to do a run and I just want to show you alpine which is the most common with the most popular Unix distro okay fine a Docker just to get it out of here whoops run what am I doing wrong exec alpine right I cannot remember my Docker commands right now what am I doing wrong people I'm doing something wrong is it does it have to be before the flags okay thank you for helping me make my case further I mean how annoying is that I'm glad that happened on the stream alive because that's exactly what I'm talking about the flags are part of the commands sometimes they're not though there has been several commands where that does not matter where they appear in the command line right but some do yeah whatever I mean it's super annoying it's super annoying because I mean how many times have I written this command I still can't remember it I should have been able to just tab my way through the thing and figure out the syntax if it had had a you know a human friendly you know rooted command tree that I would I would already know what to do right and if one of those commands has helped then I could I could say okay well this particular command has state and I can set the state variables for that thing such as remove yourself every time you know whatever so so so here we are on alpine let me just show you what I'm talking about so if you go to this slash bin and you ls that shell you'll notice right away that there is a bunch of stuff that's sim linked right if you go look at the same stuff on busybox it's hard links it's actually kind of interesting you want to see the difference they're all the same file they're all the same this is called a multicoll binary and this is a very early version probably earliest version of a contextual command interface so they maintained you know the one thing good kind of mantra from unix and from the philosophy but then they hit it from everybody by making all of them individual commands and those commands are all in a single binary that binary fits on a floppy disk on a 1.5 megabyte floppy disk that's why busybox was curated and and you can go back on a lot of people don't know this but you can go let's do the same thing let's run busybox this time assuming I can get the command right and you just go into bin here and you'll see hard links this time so the way you know it's a hard link because you got 401 hard links here they're all exactly the same size binary and they all look like they're actually separate no they're all hard links and yeah and so yeah this is this is the modern era though so the modern era started with busybox really but these days you know the closest thing I mean git was the first one git said you know Torvald said you know we got memory I'm going to put all of the commands that again now git is almost its own you know thing and strictly speaking these command lines that we're using for git or whatever are domain specific languages and you know what if we had treated them like that from the beginning we would have a much better command line world today and I am happy to report that the world has woken up and decided that creating things that are naturally intuitive like git has been I mean I mean obviously there's a lot of selections here but but let me give you another example so you can go to any one of these things right but let me give you another really good example ip the ip command right same thing it's a it's a it's a you want to call it a model it you want to call it a command with subcommands whatever you want to call it it has that and you can like kind of keep going right you can do address okay I got that and I go address tab tab oh look I got I can do address change delete flush and help I really really really love this command because I had nothing to do with this command nothing to do with it I did not even know about it and it has the the creators the brilliant people behind the ip command have created exactly what I created in bonsai to the letter to the letter now they they do allow dashes and stuff like that and but the fact that they put the help command after the command that help is a subcommand of the main command is exactly what I did was z so I do z bonsai right so I do z is the um my help is way better than that but if I do z unique right everything in bonsai comes with an optional embedded help command so I can type help and I get a man page and this has been structured exactly like the man pages and you get this help documentation for free with bonsai it automatically detects the subcommands as they have been uh composed into your monolith and at every level in the commands tree at every level of the you know the command level uh of your of your commentary you you get a different help command that is specific to the available commands under that section automatically and I built that into bonsai so the fact that the ip people have actually done the same thing and shows to put help there instead of dash h which is probably also going to work nope good for you I love the ip whoever designed the ip command you are brilliant you're a brilliant wonderful people thank you so much for seat for days and and you know there's a lot of other commands so net plan is one I know people don't like net plan but people are starting to wake up and we have git you know a cube ctl is getting better I think it'll eventually come around and create you know this this kind of interface but I just I'm just super happy with that now unfortunately uh you know that in order to get color here I still couldn't set state so guess what I had to do you're gonna see it aren't you I can't set state so the thing the thing that the people doing these command line interfaces have not yet fully accepted is a way to standardize context and so my term for this and this is going to be the term I'm going to propagate going forward is contextual rooted command trees contextual rooted command trees or stateful rooted command trees stateful contextual the point is that you should be able to set the state of your switches and and do it one at a time so I'm going to go do this one I'm going to go do another one and it's not that most of the time when you want dash c on a thing you always want dash c on a thing right and like for cube ctl how many times have you just wanted the namespace to be for a single command during a cube ctl session pretty much never right and so you are forced to go up and redo that exact same command line and rebuild it every time because there's no command to set the default namespace you can in the context but then you have to go through that convoluted context switching crap because because no one is really standardized or thought about a simplified way to do it now I have in bonsai so in bonsai you can actually do var and var is a generic way to capture variables that are stored statefully in a file for everything that uses for everything in the monolith and I really wish that that we could standardize on this so and it so the default way to do this is home art of x robbie goes into your home directory I don't know can you see that my help description is actually specific to my account you know why because I'm running the help command from the command so I have dynamic help that detects your current situation that means all that stateful stuff that we're also adding guess what you can leverage that in your help documentation so when you go man or instead of doing man rides you go z whatever help it can actually in interrogate the local cache or the very variables they've already set and it will display them in your help I mean these are things that that are like next level when it comes to thinking about these these these type of like really extremely human friendly interfaces and and and I you know just rather than getting angry about it I went ahead and build it I would like to see these things incorporated into more things but being able to standardize on dot cache z vars I mean you throw away there usually the cache oh yeah this is actually probably one of the best use cases for go but you know I mean let me just I sounds like I'm selling bounds bonsai here that's not how what I started on this but bonsai was you know of course my solution to this but I have a z monolith that that is here just to show you what I'm talking about so um you know and just to show you how easy it is to do this all I these are all of the the bonsai branches I call them which are just commands with their own trees and I just import them and they're here that's the end of it I can create my own uh dynamic template variables for my help I can set flags I can create you know if I want to do a multi-call I can do that um here is a here is a parent command so this is this is a command is different I mean you have to get into bonsai I'll do a whole thing I'm on bonsai I'm gonna write a book about bonsai actually the reason I'm doing all this keg stuff it's got a lot of books to write and one of the books I want to write is is is bonsai the book about bonsai the bonsai guide because I think and here's here's the shortcuts here's all my shortcuts through the command tree that goes into the monolith so I can bypass some things right and and stuff um and here it says uh and there's I mean here's an example of the help template which uses the most amazing templating system in the world the go templating system is by far the most powerful that's ever been created uh it's so easy to create extensive extensible uh syntax for your templates everything anyway so that's it the rest of this stuff is all pulled in from these other things including local stuff so the env go this is a sub-command I just wrote really quickly I was like hey I just want to print my environment variables and I you know just couldn't come out of stuff I I don't want to get too much into bonsai I just wanted to show you know I wrote some tmux stuff I'm in the middle of converting all of my bash scripts into a single z monolith that I can copy onto any target system including things that running any shell on planet earth because because this is a binary it doesn't care how it's being executed at all and one of the things I haven't added yet is I want to add completion so that if you I don't have this yet but if I were right now if I just do z enter it shows me the help but I am going to add so if you if you wish to you can set up the default shell and when you do z enter what it will do is it'll it'll put you into a tab completion terminal mode that's supported on any on any shell whatsoever including DOS so if and when we get that because that library has already been written I mean gh already uses it right so the gh tool already uses something to this effect so the create repo create you're seeing this more and more it has this whole terminal interactive it's like a little sort of it's not truly a command line it's an interactive terminal session but but but for places that don't have completion I want to be able to just go z enter and then enter a command and hit tab and have it find the right command on anything anything anything whatsoever because because the completion will then be built into the monolith itself in a very tiny like micro shell if you will so that that haven't built that yet but that that's coming and and to me that's that's where we're going you know we we have these these other things here you know I have my pomo command is in here and pomo start and there's my pomo up in the corner z pomo stop anyway so that that's what I I don't know what should we call them should we call them stateful or contextual what should what should we call them I think we should call them stateful rooted commandries uh that's what I think I think they're stateful I think stateful is the right word because because they do have state I mean you know the a subcommand might you know it switches and stuff might be changed now I also have a config command which is for you know that throws you into a config yaml file and lets you change your configuration for your local system for your local z bonzai command and that stuff's not meant to be temporary cache and that's the kind of thing that you would copy around with you in your dot files but the vars the vars uh you know bonzai tree those are all optional by the way you don't have to put those into your bonzai tree if you don't want but if you do put the vars uh the vars into your bonzai tree you get stuff under dot cache but then if you go onto another system and you don't take your cache with you you just get the defaults for all your your commands uh unless you you know and that's it's up to you to kind of decide whether you want to implement uh your bonzai tree command using config uh so which you know can use a centralized config by the way one config for an entire monolith um and because you know you're able to like drill down and versus um you know having having cached variables that are that are that are there now you know the amount of time it takes to read from those variables and all that stuff is so infinitesimally small that it's it's not an issue it's not an issue it might have been an issue in 1976 but it's you know it's not anymore so so that's that's what that's about um that's really all I have to say about that so I I encourage people to um to play around and if you discover a a stateful root of node tree uh root of command some somewhere um let me know and we can you know put these together I'd like I'd really like to kind of see how the world is waking up and throwing get out out thank god uh you know dashes be damned uh you know I the other great thing about this is that these interfaces that we're building can easily be spoken if you pick words that are real if you I've tested this on my on my pixel my google pixel with natural language so I mean people people are already using command lines we have like sales people using command lines because they're using uh slack right so somebody writes a slack bot or a twitch bot and you know maybe they put an exclamation point in front of it but they put a bot in there and then the bot is is processing natural you know is processing these messages all the time and those messages are real so so the more realistic and and human that we make our interfaces is simpler we make them without all the dashes you can never do this with get off right but but if we actually move to a stateful root of node tree command kind of situation all of our commands on the command line can be directly implemented as bot commands with no modification and now you can go into your favorite chat app and slack or a twitch or whatever and you can speak your commands to the thing and that is really the future now you don't need a full blown machine learning algorithm to to process every possible thing here you just need the definition of a domain specific language so that you can tell your bot or your system or whatever about it and then do it alexa's already doing this series already doing this they already have gotten in fact if you go out if you've ever written on alexa uh conversational command i was really into conversational ui for a long time about four years ago i created a thing called skeezix and and sabah which is conversational assistant virtual agent but i that's i haven't gotten anywhere without since then but i do believe that the future is going to be conversational interfaces so the more we can start using stateful rooted tree node tree commands the the closer we're going to get to conversational interactions with our computer i systems to those you know sci-fi's in the 1970s that we saw where people were talking to the computers and telling them what to do until we create conversation until we get to the point where we're getting rid of get ops i can run an ip command by speaking it into my command line if i had a voice interface i can do it i can't do that with gpg imagine that example i i want to create a new gpg key right or i want to encrypt something with gpg can i speak the command to my computer at this moment and have it work no but i could if i wanted to look up the current ip address for for a specific ethernet configuration assuming my conversational interface let me spell out you know individual um ethernet ids which would be great if some of the conversation the uis would start to allow that if they would have a keyword that said spell blah blah blah or whatever we could actually start doing that and then then we can start using our fancy microphones to write code or to interact with these systems and we will not ever be able to do that until the world wakes up as it has been and starts using stateful rooted node node node command trees or if you wish just natural language command line uis which is what it is i mean i kind of think that's probably the better way to say it we should start being we should start to use natural language command line uis and maybe that means that we put you know we make certain words optional maybe maybe we do maybe we say if somebody puts an article in there or something that we you know they don't have to talk like a robot to interact with their command line conversational ui maybe maybe we we we use regular expressions actually that's that's what schesix and kava were they actually i i wrote an app it's i got to go find it again but i started writing a conversational ui that used a regular expression to match any of the root node tree commands and now that i think about it that's probably something we could add to bonsai um the only problem with that is that uh right now the the way that the um the node tree works you have to have a single unique you know thing through it but if we could ever create a way to to add helper words that are ignored you know the or whatever without going full-blown machine learning algorithm model you know or we could we could actually start speaking in very very natural ways to our to our to our monoliths and do things like that so and i i look forward to the day but i mean just being able to tab through something to me is like is like plenty plenty good for now because i don't like reading about all the help and everything i think you should be able to to immediately understand what your options are on on any command just by hitting tab i mean if you can't do that if you have to go slog through a man page uh i mean you should be able to see boom and see all your options and go hmm this one looks really good and you know to cobra's cobra's credit i will tell them this i they you know if you tab tab through this um wait that's not the one i'm thinking of um which is the one that does it there's there's uh there's there's one oh that's not it there's there's one that uh will actually give you a summary like a very long-winded description oh no gh there is it'll give you a long-winded description it runs it into more and everything when you do this right um and i do find that kind of interesting that it that it does that um the reason it's the way it's doing that is it's actually running a shell script uh in order to get you that and that's that's a bonsai thing and that that's very shell dependent and they have different versions for each shell and i i feel like that's nice and all but i it's not it's definitely not portable so um but but i want to show this because it does show how you could break down you know the the description of of what each of the things are but i don't even think you really need that i i think you just need to be able to just do z tab tab um and you should be able to get to look at um you know all of these different things to go hmm well what does that one about right and then just do path help and you'll you can see the help okay path doesn't have that path must be a uh a shortcut to something else and i actually don't know which one it is it is a shortcut i probably should have a shortcuts command or something that is that is something that i want to look at so i mean help here will show me i think actually my help does show my shortcuts it does there it goes uh it does yay i did something good so path path thing is env get path so if i were to do z env uh help and that would give me that and you can actually do help help help help on being repressed um so so yeah you can actually the help command uh has a bunch of sub commands and it does its own parsing of the thing so i mean that's all that's all i have for this youtube video but but i encourage you as i said to to consider you know making human friendly interfaces at the end of the day that's what we're talking about and human friendly these days means conversational and that in this case means you know a stateful commentary uh and and i'm going to just shorten it i'm going to say stateful commentaries uh and there we made up a new term let me know what you think in the comments below am i youtubey enough yet", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.72,
