5. **Microsoft Word Documents**: Many modern Word documents are stored internally as XML. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the document's structure and content.

6. **Dynamic HTML (DHTML)**: A term sometimes associated with XHTML, referring to a set of technologies that allow web pages to be more interactive by manipulating the DOM with JavaScript or other scripting languages. While not directly tied to XML or XHTML, it shares a legacy as part of the evolution towards richer web interfaces.

7. **WebAPI**: The ability to access and present data from various sources on the web, typically using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the data format for communication between client-side scripts (like JavaScript) and servers. JSON is widely used because of its lightweight nature and ease of reading for both humans and machines.

8. **YAML**: A human-readable data serialization standard that is often used in scenarios where structured data representation is needed, such as configuration files or Kubernetes manifest files. YAML is also more modern and easier to use than XML for certain applications.

In summary, while XHTML is defunct and not recommended for learning or use, XML remains relevant in specific contexts like SVG, Microsoft Word documents, and some enterprise applications. For web development and data exchange, JSON and YAML are the preferred standards due to their simplicity and efficiency. It's important for developers to familiarize themselves with these modern data formats rather than spending time on legacy technologies like XHTML and XML for all use cases.

4. The speaker discusses the importance of linking documentation with definitions and the practical aspects of adopting a grammar specification, including legal considerations, licensing (Apache 2.0), attribution, and patents.

5. Pagan Parser, an extension of Peg, has been used in production at another company for over a year and a half, proving its reliability and the need for continuous improvement based on real-world usage.

6. The speaker is considering submitting their work on Pagan to a type foundation but wants to use it extensively first before formal submission.

7. The speaker is open to questions about Peg and its applications, and they are interested in writing books, including potentially one about Pagan, to help others understand and utilize these tools effectively.

8. The speaker is currently focused on completing a book titled "Terminal Velocity," which is the project they are working on at the moment. Afterward, they plan to write books on subjects that are not yet covered by existing literature, including possibly bonsai and Pagan.
