00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello, everybody. Just a quick little let you know about it.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
We've gone ahead, I've gone ahead and broken out a new phase of, or a stage, whatever you want to call it, of the skill stack beginner boost,

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
which I was playing around with before, but it's kind of materialized at this point.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
So here it is. If you look in the overview, scroll down.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
So we have added the start, which is more about getting a job and what is this strategy of getting a job and finding out what you have to learn and everything.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Very, very important stuff. Please don't skip that.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
And then we broke out the basic stuff, and that is what I'm going to show you here in just a second.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
So it's, you know, what are basic computer skills? What does it even mean?

00:53.000 --> 01:05.000
The reason that we need to break out a stage here for this, and the reason that I haven't done it in the past, is because this material is largely assumed that you already know it.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
And I do want to tell a story about this.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
So I was teaching private school coding camp, an after school coding camp, about 45 people at a private school,

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
and none of them could install software on their computers.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
They all had different computers. Some of them was Windows, some was Mac, and then some of them had admin access so they could do the installation.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Some couldn't. Some had to ask their mom and dad to do it for them. It was a mess.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
And I realized that most adults have already covered this base.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
It is interesting to note that when I actually did help out at the community college for a while when I was, you know, mentoring there,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
that so many of the people that were coming to the labs in the community college had never even used a computer.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
I know that that seems interesting to say, but there is still a huge digital divide in America.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
And there are still people in America who do not have a computer, and they do not know how to operate them.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
It's less than less a thing, but it is still a thing.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
So breaking out these skills and knowing how to use a computer and how the internet works, how to install a browser, how to install software safely,

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
how to deal with viruses, how to not get owned at a basic level as a general computer user.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
These are all really essential skills, and you may be one of the lucky ones who was raised by, you know, a family that gave you free reign on the family PC

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
and let you install and they re-imaged every once in a while, which we'll do a video about that.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
What is the best strategy for helping somebody learn these skills at a young age,

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
and how do you give them the motivation and the sort of reign that they need to be able to mess around and explore safely on the computer?

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
But, so when I talk about basic computer skills, this is what we're really talking about, and I'm just going to summarize it really quickly.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
We're talking about learning how to type, we're talking about, you know, purchasing a computer and only one computer to get,

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
whether to get a Mac or a Linux machine, whether, I'm sorry, a Mac or a Linux machine,

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
or in this case, mostly a Mac or a Windows machine, why you might want one or the other, you know, that sort of question.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
If you're just getting into tech, you may not even know the right answer there.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
So, and then stuff like, how do you install software on Windows? How do you install software on a Mac safely?

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
What are the different methods of that? How do you use the Internet? What is the Internet? Is the web the Internet?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I mean, these are questions that people literally don't know the answers to.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
So, I know a lot of you watching this video are like, why is he even doing this video?

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
But it's super important that you have this handle, understanding your developer editor options.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
I do think knowing how to edit files on your computer, whether it's simple text, no pad, or VS code,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
which I think everybody should know how to install, that becomes an issue, right?

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Because you've got to be able to edit files without knowing anything else, any of the fancy terminal stuff that we're going to learn later.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
You know, proton mail accounts, Gmail, where do you go for email? Why do you go there for email?

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
We already talked about how the Internet works. How does mail work? How does it get shipped around?

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
How do web pages actually work? And that kind of thing. How do I take notes reliably and safely that can be backed up?

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
How do I back up my computer? How do I develop search-centric habits like Alt-Tab?

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Do you know how to do Alt-Tab? Have you ever seen it before? You know how many people don't?

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
How about the spotlight bar? Knowing how to use the spotlight bar to save your time?

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
These are all skills that involve basic computer usage, which are not taught anywhere.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
They may be taught in some school systems in some community college, but they're generally not taught.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
LeverJI Assistance, that's a new thing, being able to ask ChatGPT online or on the computer to help you out.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
These are things that we, you know, more and more are being assumed as basic computer skills.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
So that change, that has been broken out.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm not going to be able to cover all this material anymore because we've already moved past it.

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
We're going to try to stay on the schedule which has us doing websites, creating basic website stuff for another week or two.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
So we're going to be doing all of that stuff, but please be sure to check back if you want to see the videos that are being made there.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Where are those videos made? The videos are made during morning boost time when I feel like it.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
That's when we're going to be making them.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
But other than that, we're going to be trying to catch up as many videos as we can during the beginner boost radio time on Saturdays.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
And we're going to continue to dedicate that four hour block making these kind of videos.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
So that is, that will hopefully catch you up with where we are.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
And I will link this video from the opening page of the beginner boost so people can know why it's changed perhaps.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
And that's all.
