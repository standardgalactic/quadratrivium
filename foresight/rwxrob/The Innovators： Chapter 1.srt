1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
time. All right. Chapter one, Ada countless of loveless. Political science. In May 1833,

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,640
when she was 17, Ada Byron was among the young women presented at the British Royal Court.

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,040
Family members had worried about how she would acquit herself, given her high, strong and

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,760
independent nature, but she ended up behaving. Her mother reported, quote, tolerably well.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,400
Among those Ada met that evening were the Duke of Wellington, whose straightforward manner

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:46,080
she admired, and the 79-year-old French ambassador, Tallie Rand, who struck her as, quote, an old monkey.

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:55,840
The only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, Ada had inherited her father's romantic spirit,

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
a trait that her mother tried to temper by having her tutored in mathematics.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,760
The combination produced an Ada a love for what she took to calling, quote, political science,

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,760
poetical science, which linked her rebellious imagination to her enchantment with numbers.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
For many, including her father, the rarefied sensibilities of the romantic era clashed

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
with the techno excitement of the industrial revolution. But Ada was comfortable at the

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:31,680
intersection of both areas. So it was not surprising that her debut at court, despite the glamour of

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,200
the occasion, made less impression on her than her attendance a few weeks later at another

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,760
majestic event of the London season. At which she met Charles Babbage, a 41-year-old widowed

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,880
science and math eminence who had established himself as a luminary on London's social circuit.

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Quote, Ada was more pleased with the party she was at on Wednesday than with any of the

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
assemblages in the Grand Monde, her mother reported to a friend. She met there a few scientific people

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,840
among them Babbage, who with whom she was very delighted, end quote. Babbage is galvanizing

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,080
weekly salons, which included up to 300 guests, brought together lords in swallowtail coats,

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,600
and ladies in brocade gowns, and writers, industrialist poets, actors, statesmen, explorers,

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,320
botanists, and other scientists, the word that Babbage's friends had recently coined.

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
By bringing scientific scholars into the exalted realm, said one of the geologists,

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,040
Babbage, quote, successfully asserted the rank in society due to science.

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:51,200
They invented the word science, my friends. The evenings featured dancing, readings, games,

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,880
and lectures accompanied by the assortment of seafood, meat, foul, exotic drinks, and ice desserts.

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,000
Cheers.

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,680
The ladies staged tableaux vivants in which they dressed in costumes to recreate famous paintings.

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,320
Astronomers set up telescopes, researchers displayed their electric and magnetic contrivances,

30
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,000
and Babbage allowed guests to play with his mechanical dolls. The centerpiece of the evening,

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,240
and one of Babbage's many motives for hosting them, was his demonstration of a model portion

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,200
of his, quote, difference engine, a mammoth mechanical calculating contraption that he

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,320
was building in the fireproof structure adjacent to his home. Babbage would display the model with

34
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,040
great drama, cranking his arm as it calculated the sequence of numbers, and just as the audience

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,480
began to get bored, showed how the pattern could suddenly be changed based on the instructions

36
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,520
that he had coded into the machine. Those who were especially intrigued would be invited through

37
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,400
the yard to the former stables where the complete machine was being constructed.

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,680
Babbage's difference engine, which could solve polynomial equations,

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,400
impressed people in different ways. The Duke of Wellington commented that it could be useful

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,320
in analyzing the variables a general might face before going into battle. Ada's mother, Lord Byron,

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,960
marveled that it was a, quote, thinking machine. As for Ada, who would later famously note that

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,960
machines could never truly think, a friend who went with them to the demonstration reported,

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,520
quote, Ms Byron, young as she was, understood its workings, and she was the, quote, great beauty

44
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,960
of the invention. Ada's love of both poetry and math primed her to see the beauty in the

45
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,240
computing machine. She was an exemplar of the era of romantic science,

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,760
which was characterized by a lyrical enthusiasm for invention and discovery.

47
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,040
It was a period that brought, quote, imaginative intensity and excitement to the scientific work,

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Richard Holmes wrote in his Age of the Wonder, quote, it was driven by the common ideal of

49
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,440
intense, even reckless personal commitment to discovery, unquote. In short, it was a time

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,640
not unlike our own. The advances of the Industrial Revolution, including the steam engine, mechanical

51
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,880
loom, and telegraph, transformed the 19th century in much the same way that the advances of the

52
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,200
digital revolution, the computer, microchip, and the internet have transformed us in our own.

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,400
At the heart of both eras were innovators who combined imagination and passion with

54
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,920
wondrous technology, a mix that produced Ada's poetic gulf science, and what the 20th century

55
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:53,600
poet Richard Rottigan would call, quote, machines of lovely grace. Lord Byron.

56
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,440
Ada inherited her poetic insubordinate temper from her father, but he was not the source of her love

57
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,520
for machinery. He was, in fact, a Luddite. In the maiden speech in the House of Lords, given in

58
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,800
February 1812, when he was about 24, Byron defended the followers of Ned Ludd, who were rampaging

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,520
against mechanical weaving machines. With sarcastic scorn, Byron mocked the mill owners of Nottingham,

60
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,920
who were pushing a bill that would have made destroying automated looms a crime punishable

61
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,440
by death, quote, these machines were to them an advantage in so much as they superseded the

62
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,320
necessity of employing a number of workmen who were left in consequence to starve, unquote,

63
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,840
Byron declared. The rejected workmen and the blindness of their ignorance instead of rejoicing

64
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,480
at the improvements in the arts so beneficial to mankind conceived themselves to be sacrificed to

65
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,440
the improvements of the mechanism, end, quote. Two weeks later, Byron published the first two

66
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,640
cantos of his epic poem, Child Harold's Pilgrimage, a romanticized account of his wanderings through

67
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,160
Portugal, Malta and Greece, and, as he later remarked, quote, awoke one morning and found

68
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,600
myself famous, end, quote. Beautiful, seductive, troubled, brooding, and sexually adventurous,

69
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,000
Byron was living a life of a bioronic hero while creating the archetype in his poetry.

70
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,680
He became the toast of literary London and was fed at three parties each day,

71
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,880
most memorable, a lavish morning dance hosted by Lady Caroline Lamb. Lady Caroline, though married

72
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,480
to a political powerful aristocrat who was later prime prime minister, fell madly in love with Byron.

73
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,160
He thought she was, quote, too thin, yet she had an unconventional sexual ambiguity.

74
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,520
She liked to dress like a page boy. He found that enticing. They had a turbulent affair and

75
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,480
after it ended, she stalked him obsessively. She famously declared to him, quote, be mad,

76
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,080
bad, and dangerous to know, which he was. So was she. At Lady Caroline's party, Lord Byron had

77
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,880
also noticed a reserved young woman who was, as he recalled, quote, more simply dressed.

78
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,320
Annabella Milbunk, 19, was from the wealthy and multi-titled family. The night before the party,

79
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,000
she had read Child Harold and had mixed feelings, quote. He is rather too much of a mannerist,

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,400
she wrote. He excels most in the delineation of deep feelings. Upon seeing him across the room

81
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,920
at the party, her feelings were conflicted, dangerously so, quote. I did not seek an introduction

82
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,480
to him for all the women were absurdly courting him and trying to deserve a lash of his satire,

83
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:45,520
she wrote to her mother. I'm not the Cyrus of a place in his laze. I made no offering at the shrine

84
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,040
of Child Harold, though I shall not refuse acquaintance if it comes my way.

85
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,000
That acquaintance, as it turned out, did come her way. After he was introduced to her formally,

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,520
Byron decided that she might make a suitable wife. It was for him a rare display of reason over

87
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,920
romanticism. Rather than arousing his passions, she seemed to be the sort of woman who might

88
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,040
tame those passions and protect him from his successes, as well as help him pay off his burdensome

89
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:21,360
debts. He proposed to her half-heartedly by letter. She sensibly declined. He wanted off to

90
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,080
far less appropriate liaisons, including one with his half-sister, Augustus Lay. But after a year,

91
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:37,760
Annabella rekindled her courtship. Byron, falling more deeply in debt while gasping for air at the

92
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,520
curb of his enthusiasm, saw the rationale if not the romance in the possible relationship.

93
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,960
Nothing but marriage and a speedy one can save me, he admitted to Annabelle's aunt.

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,040
If your niece is obtainable, I should prefer her if not the very first woman who does not

95
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,040
look as if she would spit in my face. There were times when Lord Byron was not a romantic.

96
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,520
He and Annabella were married in January 1915. Byron initiated the marriage in his

97
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:14,000
Byronic fashion. Had Lady Byron on the sofa before dinner, he wrote in his wedding day journal.

98
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,600
Their relationship was still active when they visited his half-two sisters months later because

99
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,040
around then Annabella got pregnant. However, during the visit, she began to suspect that

100
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,640
her husband's friendships with Augusta had been beyond fraternal, especially after he lay on a sofa

101
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,440
and asked them both to take him, turns kissing him. The marriage started to unravel. Annabella

102
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,960
had been tutored in mathematics, which amused Lord Byron. And during that, he was such a fucking

103
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,960
asshole. Lord Byron was such an asshole, man. And during the court should be a joked about

104
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,400
about his own disdain for the exactitude of numbers. Quote, I know that two and two make four

105
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,280
and should be glad to prove it if I could, he wrote. Though I must say, if any sort of process

106
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,400
like a convert two and two into five, it would give me great pleasure. Early on, he affectionately

107
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:14,800
dubbed her the quote, Princess of Parallelograms. I want somebody to call me the Princess of Parallelograms.

108
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:24,160
That's a great name. But when the marriage began to sour, he refined the mathematical image.

109
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,840
We are two parallel lines, prolonged by infinite side by side, but never to meet, he said. Later,

110
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,320
in his first canto of his epic poem, Don One, he would mock her. Her favorite science was the

111
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,880
mathematical. She was a walking calculation. The marriage was not saved by the birth of their

112
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:51,040
daughter or on December 10th, 1815, which may or may not be my exact birthday.

113
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,880
Some years later, of course, she was named Augusta Ada Byron, her first name that of Byron's

114
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,000
two beloved half sister. When Lady Byron became convinced of her husband's profidity,

115
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,880
she thereafter called her daughter by her middle name. Five weeks later, she packed her belongings

116
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,920
into a carriage and fled into her parents' country home with the infant Ada. Ada never knew her

117
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,160
father again. Lord Byron left the country that April after Lady Byron and led her so

118
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:30,800
calculating that she earned his subrequette of mathematical media, threatened to expose

119
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,920
his alleged incestuous and homosexual affairs as a way to secure a separation agreement that

120
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,680
gave her custody of their child. The opening of the canto three of Child Harold, written a few

121
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:53,120
weeks later, invokes Anna as his muse. In thy face, like thy mother's my fair child, Ada,

122
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,360
sole daughter of my house, of my heart. When last I saw thy young blue eyes, they smiled,

123
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,960
and then we parted. Byron wrote these lines in a villa like by Lake Geneva when he was staying

124
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:15,840
with the poet Percy Beasle Shelley and Shelley's future wife, Mary. It rained relentlessly,

125
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,360
trapped inside for days. Byron, it's like a franchise. It's like an industrial age franchise,

126
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,360
like a movie franchise. He meets the author of Frankenstein. Byron suggested that they write

127
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,440
horror stories. He produced a fragment of the tale about a vampire, one of the first literary

128
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,800
efforts of the subject, but Mary's story was the one that became classic, Frankenstein or

129
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,600
the modern Prometheus. Playing on the ancient Greek myth of the hero who crafted a living man

130
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,160
out of clay and snatched fire from the gods for human use, Frankenstein was the story of a scientist

131
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,120
who galvanized the man made assemblage into a thinking human. It was a cautionary tale about

132
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,120
technology and science and also raised a question that would become associated with Ada. Can man

133
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,560
made machines ever truly think? Third canto of chilled herald ends with Byron's prediction

134
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,800
that Annabella would try to keep Ada from knowing about her father, and so it happened.

135
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
There was a portrait of Lord Byron in the house, but Lady Byron kept it securely veiled

136
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,720
and Ada never saw it until she was 20. Lord Byron, by contrast, kept a picture of Ada on his desk

137
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,680
wherever he was, and his letters often requested news or portraits of her. When she was seven,

138
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,640
he wrote to Augusta, quote, I wish you would obtain from Lady B some accounts of Ada's disposition.

139
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,800
Is the girl imaginative? Is she passionate? I hope that the gods have made her anything

140
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,480
save political. It is enough to have one such fool in the family. Lady Byron reported that Ada had

141
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,920
an imagination that was, quote, chiefly exercised in connection with her mechanical ingenuity.

142
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,640
Around the time Byron, who had been wandering through Italy,

143
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,160
writing and having an assortment of affairs, grew bored and decided to enlist in the Greek

144
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:11,680
struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. He sailed to Missologna, wherever he took command

145
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,920
of the part of the rebel army and prepared to attack the Turkish forces. But before he could

146
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,720
engage in battle, he caught a violent cold that was made worse by the doctor's decision to treat

147
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,920
him by bloodletting. On April 19, 1824, he died. According to his valet among his final words were,

148
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,560
quote, Oh, my poor dear child, my dear Ada, my God, could I have seen her? Give her my blessing.

149
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Ada.

150
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,040
I've been reading the chat, but whatever.

151
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,400
Lord Byron wanted to make sure that Ada did not turn out like her father.

152
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,280
And Byron's strategy was to have the girls rigorously study math,

153
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,840
as if it were an antidote to poetic imagination. When Ada at age five showed a preference for

154
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,640
geography, Lady Byron ordered that the subject be replaced by additional arithmetic lessons,

155
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,560
and her governess soon proudly reported, quote, she adds up sums of five and six rows of figures

156
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,400
with accuracy. Despite these efforts, Ada developed some of her father's propensities.

157
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,480
She had an affair with a young teenager with one of her tutors and with one of her tutors,

158
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,800
and when they were caught and the tutor banished, she tried to run away from the home to be with him.

159
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,240
In addition, she had mood swings that took her from feelings of grandiosity to despair,

160
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,600
and she suffered various maladies, both physical and psychological.

161
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,600
Ada accepted her mother's conviction that the immersion in math could help

162
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,360
pertain her Byronic tendencies. After her dangerous liaison with her tutor and inspired

163
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,200
by Babbage's Difference Engine, she decided on her own at 18 to begin a new series of lessons,

164
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,880
quote, I must cease to think of living for pleasure or self-critification, she wrote to her new tutor.

165
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,400
I find that nothing but very close and intense application of subjects of a scientific nature

166
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,400
now seems to keep my imagination running wild from running wild. It appears to me that the first

167
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,240
thing to go through the course of mathematics, the first thing is to go through a course of

168
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,120
mathematics. He agreed with the prescription. You are right in supposing that your chief resource

169
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,680
and safeguard at the present is the course of severe intellectual study. For this purpose,

170
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,240
there is no subject to be compared to mathematics. The tutor prescribed Euclidean geometry

171
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,040
followed by a dose of trigonometry and algebra. That should cure anyone, they both thought,

172
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:52,480
from having too much artistic and romantic passion. That's awesome.

173
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,120
Ada's interest in technology was stoked when her mother took her on a trip through the British

174
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,800
industrial midlands to see the new factories and machinery. Ada was particularly impressed with an

175
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,800
automated weaving loom and used punch cards to direct the creation of the desired fabrics the way

176
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,920
she wanted to. That was, by the way, well, we're going to get to it. She drew a sketch of how it

177
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,960
worked. Her father's famous speech in the House of Lords had defended the Luddites who would smash

178
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,520
such looms because of their fear of what technology might do to their humanity, but Ada waxed political

179
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,520
about them and saw the connection with what would someday be called computers.

180
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,000
This machine reminds me of Babbage and the gem of all mechanisms, she wrote.

181
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Ada's interest in applied science was further simulated when she met with one of Bruton's

182
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,720
free you for you noted female mathematician scientists, Mary Somerville. Somerville had

183
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,760
just finished writing one of her great works on the connection of the physical sciences

184
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
in which she tied together developments of astronomy, optics, and electricity,

185
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,360
chemistry, physics, botany, and geology. In Blomantic of the Time, it proved in a unified

186
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,160
sense of the extraordinary endeavors of discovery that were underway. She proclaimed in her opening

187
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,920
sentence, quote, the progress of modern science, especially within the last five years, has been

188
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,600
remarkable for a tendency to simplify the laws of nature and to unite detached branches of general

189
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,920
principles. Somerville became a friend, teacher, inspiration, and mentor Ada. She met with Ada

190
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,240
regularly. She sent her math books, devised problems for her to solve, and patiently explained the

191
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:48,720
correct answers. Mentorship, my friends, mentorship. She was a good friend of Babbage's and during the

192
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:59,520
fall of 1834, she and Ada would often visit this his Saturday evening solans. Somerville's son,

193
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,840
Wuronzo Greg, aided Ada's efforts to settle down by suggesting to one of his former classmates at

194
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,480
Cambridge that she would make a suitable or at least interesting wife.

195
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:21,840
William King was socially prominent, financially secure, quietly intelligent,

196
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,200
and as taciturn as Ada was excitable. Like her, he was a student of the science,

197
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,840
but his focus was more practical and less poetic. His primary interests were crop rotation theories

198
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,000
and advances in livestock breeding techniques. He proposed marriage within a few weeks of

199
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,840
meeting Ada, and she accepted. Her mother, with motives that only a psychiatrist could

200
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,240
fast as she could fathom, decided it was imperative to tell William about Ada's attempted

201
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,200
elopement with her tutor. Despite the news, William was willing to proceed with the wedding,

202
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,600
which was held on July 1835. Gracious God, who has so mercifully given you an opportunity

203
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,920
for turning aside the dangerous past, has given you a friend and guardian. Lady Byron wrote her

204
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,680
daughter, adding that she should use this opportunity to quote, bid adieu to all of her

205
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:18,000
peculiarities, capriciousness, and self-seeking. The marriage was a match made in rational calculus.

206
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,200
For Ada, it offered her a chance to adopt much more steady and grounded life.

207
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,840
More importantly, it allowed her to escape dependence on her domineering mother,

208
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,960
for William had been having a fascinating, eccentric wife from a wealthy and famous family.

209
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Lord Byron's first cousin, Viscut Melbourne, who had the misfortune of having been married

210
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,480
to Lady Caroline Lamb by then deceased, was the prime minister, and he arranged that Queen

211
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,040
Victoria's coronation list of honors, William, would become the Earl of Loveless.

212
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,600
His wife thus became Ada, Countess of Loveless. She is therefore properly referred to as

213
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,000
Ada or Lady Loveless, though she is now commonly known as Ada Loveless.

214
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,600
That Christmas in 1835, Ada received from her mother the most fam- family-side portrait of her

215
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,160
father, painted by Thomas Phillips. It showed Lord Byron in a romantic profile, gazing at the

216
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,040
horizon, dressed in a traditional Albanian costume, featuring a red velvet jacket,

217
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,760
ceremonial sword, and headrest. For years, it had hung over Ada's grandparents' metal,

218
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,360
but it had never been veiled and unseen by the green cloth from the day her parents had separated.

219
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,640
Now she was trusted not only to see it, but to possess it, along with its ink stand and pen.

220
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,520
Her mother did something that was even more surprising when the Loveless first child,

221
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,800
a son, was born. A few months later, despite her disdain for her late husband's memory,

222
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:54,080
she agreed that Ada should name the boy Byron, which she did. The following year, Ada had a

223
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,800
daughter whom she dutifully named Annabella after her mother. Ada then came down with yet another

224
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,000
mysterious malady, which kept her bedridden for months. She recovered well enough to have a third

225
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
child, a son named Ralph, but her health remained fragile. She had digestive and respiratory problems,

226
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:20,080
and these were compounded by being treated with londonum, morphine, and other forms of opium,

227
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,760
which led to mood swings and occasional delusions. Ada was further unsettled by the

228
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,920
eruption of a personal drama that was bizarre enough by the standards of the Byron family.

229
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,040
It involved Madora Le, the daughter of Byron's half-sister and occasional lover.

230
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,240
According to the widely accepted rumors, Madora was Byron's daughter.

231
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,080
She seemed determined to show that that darkness ran in the family. She had an affair with a

232
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,280
sister's husband and then ran off with him to France and had two little limited illegitimate

233
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,840
children. In a fit of self-righteousness, Lady Byron went to France rescue Madora,

234
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,840
then revealed to Ada that the story of her father's incest.

235
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,000
This, quote, most strange and dreadful story did not seem to surprise Ada. I'm not happy

236
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,840
in the least astonished, but I'm not in the least astonished, she wrote to her mother.

237
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,760
You merely confirm that I have known for years and felt scarcely doubt about.

238
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,560
Rather than being outraged, she seemed oddly energized by the news. She declared that she

239
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,760
could relate to her father's defiance authority. Referring to his, quote, misused genius,

240
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,040
she wrote to her mother, quote, if he had transmitted to me any portion of that genius,

241
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,200
I would use it to bring out great truths and principles. I think he has bequested me

242
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,760
this task, in fact. I have this feeling strongly, and there is a pleasure attending to it, end quote.

243
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
Once again, Ada took up the study of math in order to settle herself.

244
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,600
She tried to convince Babish to become her tutor. I have a peculiar way of learning,

245
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:59,040
and I think it is, it must be a peculiar man to teach me, she said, whether due to her opiates

246
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:06,240
or her breeding or both. She developed a somewhat outsized opinion of her own talents,

247
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,440
and began to describe herself as a genius. In her letter to Babish, she wrote, quote,

248
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,240
do not reckon me conceited, but I believe I have the power of going just as far as I like in such

249
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,120
pursuits. And where were there is no decided a taste, I should almost say a passion as I have

250
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,120
for them. I question if there is not always some portion of natural genius even.

251
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,400
Babish deflected Ada's request, which was probably wise. It preserved their friendship

252
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,640
for an even more important collaboration, and she was able to secure a first-rate math tutor instead,

253
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,120
Augustus de Morgan, a patient gentleman who was pioneer in the field of symbolic logic.

254
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,240
He had propounded a concept that Ada would one day employ with great significance,

255
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,080
which was an algebraic equation could apply to things other than numbers. The relations among

256
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,280
symbols, for example, A plus B equals B plus A, could be part of a logic that applied to things

257
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,680
that were not numerical. And that slammed a calculus, by the way, I've been reading about it.

258
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:22,560
Oh, great. Love it. Am I drinking? I'm drinking rum.

259
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,120
Ada was never the great mathematician in her canonizer's claim,

260
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,880
but she was an eager pupil able to grasp most of the basic concepts of calculus and with her

261
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,720
artistic sensibility, she liked to visualize the changing curves and trajectories of the

262
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,840
equations being described. De Morgan, her tutor, encouraged her to focus on the rules

263
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,720
for working through equations, but she was more eager to discuss the underlying concepts.

264
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,280
Likewise with geometry, she often asked for visual ways to picture problems,

265
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,480
such as how the intersections of circles in a sphere divided into various shapes.

266
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,560
Ada's ability to appreciate the beauty of mathematics is a gift that eludes many people,

267
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,520
including some who think of themselves as intellectual. She realized that math was a

268
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,400
love, this is a narrator, that she realized that math was a loving language. Well, that described

269
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,240
the harmoniousness of the universe and can be poetic at times. Despite her mother's effort,

270
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,160
she remained her father's daughter with a poetic sensibility that allowed her to view the equations

271
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,280
of the brushstroke that painted an aspect of nature's physical splendor, just as she could

272
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,280
visualize the, quote, wire-dark sea, or a woman who, quote, walks in beauty light at night.

273
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,400
But math's appeal went even deeper for her. It was spiritual. Math constitutes the language

274
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,480
through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of the natural world, she said.

275
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,360
And it allows us to portray, quote, the changes of mutual relationship that unfold in creation.

276
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:13,440
It is the instrument through which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his creator's works.

277
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,320
This ability to apply imagination to science characterized industrial revolution as well

278
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,320
as the computer revolution, for which Ada was to become a major patron saint. She was able,

279
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,600
as she told Babbage, to understand the connection between poetry and analysis in ways that transcended

280
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:40,960
her father's talents. I do not believe that my father was or ever could have been such a poet

281
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,920
as I shall be an analyst. For with me, the two go together indissolutably, she wrote.

282
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,480
Her re-engagement with math, she told her mother, spurred her creativity and led to,

283
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,080
and quote, immense development of imagination, so much so that I feel no doubt that I continue my

284
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,120
studies, I shall do in due time become a poet. The whole concept of imagination, especially as it

285
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,480
was a pleasure technology, intrigued her. What is imagination, she asked in 1841. It is the

286
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,840
combining faculty, it brings together things, facts, and ideas, conceptions in new, original,

287
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,400
endless, ever-varying combinations. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us

288
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:33,920
and the worlds of science. By then Ada believed she possessed special, even supernatural abilities,

289
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,200
what she called, quote, an intuitive perception of hidden things. Her exalted view of her talents

290
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,320
led her to pursue aspirations that were unusual for an aristocratic woman and a mother of the

291
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,360
early Victorian age. Quote, I believe myself to possess a most singular combination of qualities

292
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,360
exactly fitted to make my preeminently a discoverer of the hidden realities of nature, end quote.

293
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,360
She explained in a letter that her mother in 1841, quote, I can throw rays from every

294
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,560
core of the universe into one vast focus. It was while this fame of mine that she just,

295
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,600
it was in this frame of mind that she decided to engage again with Charles Babbage, whose salons

296
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:24,160
she had first attended eight years earlier. She thinks she's Sheldon. She really does.

297
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,080
This is the innovators from Walter Isaacson.

298
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Charles Babbage and his engines. Probably, this probably be the last one.

299
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,640
From an early age, Charles Babbage had been interested in machinery that could perform human

300
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,280
tests. When he was a child, his mother took him to many of the exhibition halls and numerous

301
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,680
museums that were springing up in London in the early 1800s. At one in Hanover Square,

302
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,440
a proprietor aptly named Merlin, invited him up to the attic workshop where there was a

303
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:17,120
variety of mechanical dolls known as automata. One was a silver female dancer about a foot tall,

304
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,200
whose arms moved with grace and who held in her hand a bird that could wag its tail,

305
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,560
flip its wings and open its beak. The silver lady's ability to display feelings and personality

306
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:34,080
captured the boys' fancy. Her eyes were full of imagination, he recalled. Years later, he discovered

307
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,600
the silver lady at a bankruptcy auction and bought it. It served as an amusement at the evening of

308
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,440
salons which he celebrated with wonders of technology later. At Cambridge, Babbage became

309
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:53,040
friends with groups including John Herschel and George Peacock who were disappointed by the way

310
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,640
math was being taught there. They formed a club called the Analytical Society which campaigned

311
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,440
to get the university to abandon the calculus notation devised by the alumnus Newton which

312
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:11,200
relied on dots and replaced it with the one devised by Leibniz which used dx and dy to represent

313
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,240
infinitesimally increments in what was known as denotation. Babbage's title the manifesto

314
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,800
quote that principles appear deism in opposition to the dot edge of the university. He was picky

315
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,920
but he had a good sense of humor. One day Babbage was at the Analytical Society's room working on

316
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,320
a table of logarithms that was littered with discrepancies. Herschel asked if him what he was

317
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,200
thinking quote he said, I wish to god these calculations had been executed by steam, Babbage

318
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,080
answered. To this idea of mechanical method for tabulating logarithms Herschel replied,

319
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,960
it is quite possible. In 1821 Babbage turned his attention to building just such a machine.

320
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:02,000
Over the years many had fiddled with making calculations, contraptions. In the 1640s Blaise

321
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,400
Pascal a French mathematician and philosopher created the mechanism, the mechanical calculator

322
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,080
to reduce the drudgery of his father's work as a tax supervisor. It had spoke metal wheels with

323
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,120
a digits zero through nine on their circumference. To add or subtract numbers the operator used a

324
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,920
stylus to dial a number as if using a rotary phone. Then dialed in the next number and armature

325
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,160
then carried or borrowed a one when necessary. It became the first calculator to be patented

326
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,320
and sold commercially. 30 years later Godfrey Libnitz the German mathematician philosopher

327
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,680
tried to improve upon Pascal's contraption with a quote stepped reckoner that had the capacity

328
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:48,560
to multiply and divide. It had a hand crake cylinder and a set of teeth that meshed with counting

329
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,200
wheels. But Libnitz ran into a problem that would be a recurring theme for the digital age.

330
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,080
Unlike Pascal and a Duat engineer who could combine scientific theories with mechanical genius

331
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Libnitz had engineering skills that did not surround himself with those who did.

332
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,720
So like many great theories who lacked practical collaborators he was unable to produce reliable

333
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,280
working versions of his device. Nevertheless his core concepts known as the Liebnitz wheel

334
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,800
would influence calculator design through the time of Babbage.

335
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,040
Babbage knew of the devices of Pascal and Libnitz and he was trying to do something better than

336
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,520
them that was more complex. He wanted to construct a mechanical method for tabulating logarithmic

337
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,560
signs and cosines and tangents. To do so he adapted an idea from the French mathematician Gaspar

338
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,520
de Pony who had come up in the 1790s. In order to create logarithmic and trigonometric tables

339
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,320
de Pony broke down the operations into very simple steps that involved the only addition

340
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,760
and mess of traction. Then he provided easy instructions so that the scores of human laborers

341
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,080
who knew the little math could perform these simple tasks and pass along their answers to

342
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,920
the next set of laborers. In other words he created an assembly line the great industrial age

343
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,120
innovation that was memorably analyzed by Adam Smith in his description of the division of labor

344
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:13,360
in the pin making factory. After a trip to Paris in which he heard of de Pony's method Babbage wrote

345
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,080
I conceived all of a sudden the idea of applying this same method

346
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:24,560
to the immense work with which I had been burdened and to manufacture logarithms as one manufactures

347
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,960
pins. Even complex mathematical tasks Babbage realized could be broken into steps that came

348
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:44,560
down into calculating quote finite differences.

349
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,200
All right.

350
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,840
Calculating finite differences through simple adding and subtracting. For example in order to make a table

351
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,480
of squares one to the second two to the second three to second four to the second and so on

352
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,320
you could list the initial numbers in such a sequence one four nine sixteen. This would be column

353
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,440
A. Beside it in column B you could figure out the differences between each and the numbers in this

354
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,320
case three five nine seven and nine. Column C would be a list of differences between the column

355
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,040
B numbers which is two two two and two. Once the process was a simplified it could be reversed

356
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:39,120
and the task parceled out to untutored laborers. One would be in charge of adding two to the last

357
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,520
number of the column B and then the hand that resulted to the other person would then add the

358
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,120
results to the number A thus generating the next number in the sequence of squares. Babbage

359
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,400
divides the way to mechanize the process and he named it the difference engine. It can tabulate

360
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,200
any polynomial function and provide a number a digital method of approximating the solution to

361
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,600
differential equations. How did it work? The difference engine used vertical shafts with disks

362
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,800
that could be turned to any numeral. They were attached to cogs that would be cranked in order

363
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,240
to add that numeral or to subtract from it a disk on an adjacent shaft. The contraption was even

364
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,560
store the interim result on another shaft. The main complexity was how to carry or borrow when

365
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,200
necessary and what to do with pencils when we calculate the same thing we do with pencils

366
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,040
when we do 36 plus 19 or 42 minus 17. Drawing on Pascal's devices Babbage came up with a few

367
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:39,440
ingenious contrivances and allowed the cogs and shafts to handle the calculation. The machine

368
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,600
wasn't concept of true marvel. Babbage even figured out a way to get it to create a table

369
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,160
of prime numbers up to 10 million. The British government was impressed and at least initially

370
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:56,000
in 1823 it gave him a seed money of 1,700 pounds and would eventually sink more than 17,000 pounds

371
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,600
twice the cost of a warship into the device during the decade Babbage spent trying to build it.

372
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,720
But the project ran into two problems. First, Babbage had his hired engineer did not quite

373
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,320
have the skills to get the device working. Second, he began dreaming up something even better.

374
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,320
Babbage's new idea which he conceived in 1834 was a general purpose computer that could carry out

375
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,040
the very a variety of different operations based on programmatic instructions given to it.

376
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,320
It could perform one task and it made a switch to the perform another. It could even tell itself

377
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,640
to switch tasks or alter its quote patterns of action as Babbage called it based on its own

378
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,360
interim calculations. Babbage names this proposed machine the quote analytical engine. He was 100

379
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,040
years ahead of his time. The analytical engine was the product of what Ada Lovelace in her essay of

380
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,960
imagination had called quote the combining faculty. Babbage had combined innovations that had cropped

381
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,840
up in other fields to trick many great inventors have done. He had originally used a metal drum

382
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,000
for what had that was studied with spikes to control the shafts and how they would turn.

383
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,120
Then he studied as Ada had the automated loom invented by 1801 by the Frenchman named Joseph

384
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:19,600
Marie Jacquard which transformed the silk weaving industry. Looms created a pattern by using hooks

385
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,760
to lift selected warp threads and then a rod pushes a wolf thread underneath. Jacquard invented

386
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,720
a method of using cards with hole punches in order to control this process. The holes determine

387
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,480
which hooks and rods would be activated for each pass of the weave thus automating the creation

388
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,200
of intricate patterns. Each time the shuttle that was thrown to create a new pass of the thread a

389
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,520
new punch card was coming to play. On June 30th 1836 Babbage made an entry into what he called

390
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,680
his quote scribbling books that would represent the milestone in his pre in the prehistory of

391
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,640
computers quote suggested Jacquard's loom as a substitute for the drums. Using punch cards rather

392
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,040
than still drums meant that an unlimited number of instructions could be input into the machine.

393
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,360
In addition the sequence of tasks could be unmodified thus making it easier to devise a

394
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:13,440
general purpose machine that was versatile and reprogrammable. Babbage brought a portrait of

395
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,400
Jacquard and began to display it at the salons. He showed the inventor sitting in an armchair

396
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,040
loom in the background holding a pair of calipers over irregularly punch cards. Babbage amused his

397
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,560
guest by asking him to guess what it was. Most thought it was a superb engraving. He would then

398
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:39,440
reveal that it was actually a finely woven silk tapestry with 24,000 rows of threads each controlled

399
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,240
by a different punch card. When Prince Albert the husband of Queen Victoria came to one of

400
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,720
Babbage's salons he asked Babbage why he found the tapestry so interesting. Babbage replied

401
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,640
it will greatly assist in explaining the nature of my calculating machine, the analytical engine.

402
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,320
Few people however saw the beauty of Babbage's proposed new machine as the British government

403
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,880
had no inclination to fund it. Try and see my Babbage head could generate little notice in the

404
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,640
either popular press or the scientific journals but he did find one believer, Ada Loveless,

405
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,000
fully appreciated the concept of the general purpose machine. More importantly she envisioned an

406
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,200
attribute that might make it truly amazing if it could potentially process not only numbers

407
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:34,080
but any symbolic notation including musical and artistic notes. She saw the poetry in such an

408
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,840
idea and she set out to encourage others to see it as well. She barraged Babbage with letters some

409
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:46,000
of which verged on cheeky even though he was 24 years her senior and once she described her solitary

410
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,040
game using 26 marbles where the goal is to execute jumps so that only one of the marbles remains.

411
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,640
She had mastered it but was trying to derive a quote mathematical formula on which the solution

412
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,480
depends and which she could put her symbolic language to. Then she asked quote I am too

413
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,960
imaginative for you I think not. Her goal was to work with Babbage as his publicist and partner

414
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,160
in trying to get support to build the analytical engine quote I am very anxious to talk to you

415
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,840
she wrote in a early 1841 quote I will give you a hint on what it strikes me that at some

416
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:32,400
future time my head may be made by you subservient to some of your proposals and plans if so if ever

417
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,600
I could be worthy of capable of being used by you my head will be yours. A year later a tailor

418
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:49,040
made opportunity presented itself to the young Eda.
