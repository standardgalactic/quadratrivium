1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
All right, so the question is, should you use books or should you just use a documentation

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,800
that comes with the program?

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,280
Somebody asked a question, so I'm answering it.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,280
It's a very easy one.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,480
Yes, you should do both.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
You should do both.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,920
You should use books and you should use the man page.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,040
It's funny because there's actually a very negative comment on one of my YouTube videos

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,240
I read recently that said, oh, this is another one of those boomers is going to tell us to

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,880
just read the man pages that come with the system.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm going to refrain from being negative about this completely unemployed mediocre, doesn't

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
finish watching the video.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
A human being who made a comment on my YouTube video, hey, there's a lot of them and I will

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,040
instead say that if you are going to learn something, you need to figure out what it

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,200
is you're going to learn and then you need to target the learning resources that are

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,080
best to learn that thing.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,640
I don't need to say anything else.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
Is it a book?

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,800
Let me tell you the advantages of books over the stuff that comes on the system.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,760
The advantage of a book is that the book has largely usually been edited.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,680
That means that somebody has, there's usually a single author, one or two people have authored

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,360
it, so you get a common voice.

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
It's usually been edited.

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Usually, it's been edited.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
I actually did another video all about that.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,840
Why is it to stay away from pack publishing versus a Riley, blah, blah, blah.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,600
You want to get a good book.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,720
As usual, find, if you've got a mentor already, if you have somebody who's in the industry

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
and you've already done the work, which is way, way, way, way before you should be asking

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,880
whether you should read a book or not, you shouldn't be asking me that.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,600
You should be asking the person that you've found to be your mentor and that is something

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,360
you should have already done.

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,480
You might be using me as a fill-in for your mentor for right now, but I'm telling you,

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,880
find a mentor who's doing your job, the job you want, and then ask them, what do you think

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
is good?

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Is this book good?

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,920
Is this thing here good?

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
Is this video good?

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,280
Is this series good?

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,640
Because they're going to be the ones that are going to tell you what learning resources

41
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
use.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,080
That is really at the core of the question.

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,160
The question isn't about whether you should read from the man pages and do web searches

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
on a given thing or should you read the book.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,600
The question is, where is the best place to learn the skills, knowledge, and abilities

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,600
for the specific targeted career that I want, Mr. or Mrs. Mentor?

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,960
You're going to ask the person, not me, and it's going to depend completely depending

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
on the thing.

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,960
I'm not trying to dodge the question.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm trying to tell you that it makes sense.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,760
I have one story about this.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
I've told a story before.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm going to tell you a quick version of it.

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
I went to training for a week.

55
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,560
I've done this video, I've done this story like three times.

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,600
I went to training for a week, so they paid $2,500, $3,000, something like that.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Horrible training.

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,960
Everybody got a gold star at the end.

59
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,280
I went home and said, never send me to that again, manager.

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Barb loved her.

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
She was great.

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Give me the money instead.

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,680
Went to Powell's books in Portland, bought all the books I ever could want to study and

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
learn from those books.

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,360
Having learned from my mentors, those were the books to get.

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,880
We're talking about old school chin beard, brilliant geniuses who dropped out of Reed

67
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:26,160
College, who had printed versions of the Unixman pages on their shelves.

68
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,480
Stupid YouTube commenters who don't understand how to do capitalization might make comments

69
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,600
about those people.

70
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,440
I would rather listen to them.

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,920
They said, no, if you wanted a definitive resource on Bash, there is nothing better than

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,440
the Bashman page, literally.

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,400
There is not a single book on planet Earth that covers completion using the dash capital

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,480
C on Bash.

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,320
It just does not exist.

76
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,680
I only discovered it by reading the Bashman page.

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,720
It does not exist anywhere else.

78
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,360
If you want a comprehensive knowledge of a particular thing, in the case of Bash, you

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,000
would go with the Bashman page on the system above any other printed material.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,360
I've read five or six other books related to it.

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Yes, it's true that sometimes the resource is going to be better.

82
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,240
If you want to understand TCPIP, you can read the specification for TCPIP and the RFCs.

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,320
You learn to read specifications, separate video about learning to read specifications.

84
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,120
At some point, I don't know if that's necessarily going to fall under the boost.

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
We'll find out.

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
But reading the specifications is a really good way to do that.

87
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
Or you can buy TCPIP illustrated from Addison Wesley, which is the standard college textbook

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,160
to learn TCPIP.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,720
But it's extremely deep.

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,000
It's extremely low level.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,880
It tells you everything you want to know about how a packet is formed.

92
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,160
Should you buy the book or should you go read the spec?

93
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
Probably both in that case.

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,040
The point is, it depends, and hopefully you have enough stories to do that.

95
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,720
Hopefully you have enough stories to know about how to go on that.
