0	7800	All right, so the question is, should you use books or should you just use a documentation
7800	10800	that comes with the program?
10800	12280	Somebody asked a question, so I'm answering it.
12280	14280	It's a very easy one.
14280	18480	Yes, you should do both.
18480	19480	You should do both.
19480	20920	You should use books and you should use the man page.
20920	24040	It's funny because there's actually a very negative comment on one of my YouTube videos
24040	28240	I read recently that said, oh, this is another one of those boomers is going to tell us to
28240	33880	just read the man pages that come with the system.
33880	40200	I'm going to refrain from being negative about this completely unemployed mediocre, doesn't
40200	41200	finish watching the video.
41200	46480	A human being who made a comment on my YouTube video, hey, there's a lot of them and I will
46480	52040	instead say that if you are going to learn something, you need to figure out what it
52040	55200	is you're going to learn and then you need to target the learning resources that are
55200	58080	best to learn that thing.
59080	61640	I don't need to say anything else.
61640	62640	Is it a book?
62640	66800	Let me tell you the advantages of books over the stuff that comes on the system.
66800	72760	The advantage of a book is that the book has largely usually been edited.
72760	77680	That means that somebody has, there's usually a single author, one or two people have authored
77680	79360	it, so you get a common voice.
79360	80360	It's usually been edited.
80360	81360	Usually, it's been edited.
81360	83360	I actually did another video all about that.
84120	87840	Why is it to stay away from pack publishing versus a Riley, blah, blah, blah.
87840	89600	You want to get a good book.
89600	94720	As usual, find, if you've got a mentor already, if you have somebody who's in the industry
94720	97920	and you've already done the work, which is way, way, way, way before you should be asking
97920	100880	whether you should read a book or not, you shouldn't be asking me that.
100880	104600	You should be asking the person that you've found to be your mentor and that is something
104600	107360	you should have already done.
107360	111480	You might be using me as a fill-in for your mentor for right now, but I'm telling you,
111480	116880	find a mentor who's doing your job, the job you want, and then ask them, what do you think
116880	117880	is good?
117880	118880	Is this book good?
118880	119920	Is this thing here good?
119920	121200	Is this video good?
121200	122280	Is this series good?
122280	124640	Because they're going to be the ones that are going to tell you what learning resources
124640	125640	use.
125640	127080	That is really at the core of the question.
127080	132160	The question isn't about whether you should read from the man pages and do web searches
132160	134160	on a given thing or should you read the book.
134160	141600	The question is, where is the best place to learn the skills, knowledge, and abilities
141600	148600	for the specific targeted career that I want, Mr. or Mrs. Mentor?
148600	152960	You're going to ask the person, not me, and it's going to depend completely depending
152960	153960	on the thing.
153960	156960	I'm not trying to dodge the question.
156960	158560	I'm trying to tell you that it makes sense.
158560	159760	I have one story about this.
159760	160760	I've told a story before.
160760	163680	I'm going to tell you a quick version of it.
163680	164920	I went to training for a week.
164920	169560	I've done this video, I've done this story like three times.
169560	174600	I went to training for a week, so they paid $2,500, $3,000, something like that.
174600	175600	Horrible training.
175600	176960	Everybody got a gold star at the end.
176960	179280	I went home and said, never send me to that again, manager.
179280	180280	Barb loved her.
180280	181280	She was great.
181280	182280	Give me the money instead.
182280	186680	Went to Powell's books in Portland, bought all the books I ever could want to study and
186680	187680	learn from those books.
187680	192360	Having learned from my mentors, those were the books to get.
192360	197880	We're talking about old school chin beard, brilliant geniuses who dropped out of Reed
197880	206160	College, who had printed versions of the Unixman pages on their shelves.
206160	209480	Stupid YouTube commenters who don't understand how to do capitalization might make comments
209480	210600	about those people.
210600	212440	I would rather listen to them.
212440	216920	They said, no, if you wanted a definitive resource on Bash, there is nothing better than
216920	219440	the Bashman page, literally.
219440	225400	There is not a single book on planet Earth that covers completion using the dash capital
225400	226480	C on Bash.
226480	228320	It just does not exist.
228320	230680	I only discovered it by reading the Bashman page.
230680	233720	It does not exist anywhere else.
233720	237360	If you want a comprehensive knowledge of a particular thing, in the case of Bash, you
237360	241000	would go with the Bashman page on the system above any other printed material.
241000	244360	I've read five or six other books related to it.
244360	249360	Yes, it's true that sometimes the resource is going to be better.
249360	253240	If you want to understand TCPIP, you can read the specification for TCPIP and the RFCs.
253240	257320	You learn to read specifications, separate video about learning to read specifications.
257320	260120	At some point, I don't know if that's necessarily going to fall under the boost.
260120	261120	We'll find out.
261120	264320	But reading the specifications is a really good way to do that.
264320	269280	Or you can buy TCPIP illustrated from Addison Wesley, which is the standard college textbook
269280	271160	to learn TCPIP.
271160	272720	But it's extremely deep.
272720	274000	It's extremely low level.
274000	276880	It tells you everything you want to know about how a packet is formed.
276880	280160	Should you buy the book or should you go read the spec?
280160	281360	Probably both in that case.
281360	286040	The point is, it depends, and hopefully you have enough stories to do that.
286040	287720	Hopefully you have enough stories to know about how to go on that.
