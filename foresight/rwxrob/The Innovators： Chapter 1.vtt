00:00.000 --> 00:12.480
time. All right. Chapter one, Ada countless of loveless. Political science. In May 1833,

00:12.480 --> 00:18.640
when she was 17, Ada Byron was among the young women presented at the British Royal Court.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.040
Family members had worried about how she would acquit herself, given her high, strong and

00:25.040 --> 00:31.760
independent nature, but she ended up behaving. Her mother reported, quote, tolerably well.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.400
Among those Ada met that evening were the Duke of Wellington, whose straightforward manner

00:38.400 --> 00:46.080
she admired, and the 79-year-old French ambassador, Tallie Rand, who struck her as, quote, an old monkey.

00:46.160 --> 00:55.840
The only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, Ada had inherited her father's romantic spirit,

00:55.840 --> 00:59.840
a trait that her mother tried to temper by having her tutored in mathematics.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.760
The combination produced an Ada a love for what she took to calling, quote, political science,

01:05.760 --> 01:11.760
poetical science, which linked her rebellious imagination to her enchantment with numbers.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.920
For many, including her father, the rarefied sensibilities of the romantic era clashed

01:17.920 --> 01:23.040
with the techno excitement of the industrial revolution. But Ada was comfortable at the

01:23.040 --> 01:31.680
intersection of both areas. So it was not surprising that her debut at court, despite the glamour of

01:31.680 --> 01:39.200
the occasion, made less impression on her than her attendance a few weeks later at another

01:39.200 --> 01:47.760
majestic event of the London season. At which she met Charles Babbage, a 41-year-old widowed

01:47.760 --> 01:52.880
science and math eminence who had established himself as a luminary on London's social circuit.

01:53.760 --> 01:59.040
Quote, Ada was more pleased with the party she was at on Wednesday than with any of the

01:59.040 --> 02:05.040
assemblages in the Grand Monde, her mother reported to a friend. She met there a few scientific people

02:05.040 --> 02:11.840
among them Babbage, who with whom she was very delighted, end quote. Babbage is galvanizing

02:11.840 --> 02:18.080
weekly salons, which included up to 300 guests, brought together lords in swallowtail coats,

02:18.800 --> 02:25.600
and ladies in brocade gowns, and writers, industrialist poets, actors, statesmen, explorers,

02:25.600 --> 02:30.320
botanists, and other scientists, the word that Babbage's friends had recently coined.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.000
By bringing scientific scholars into the exalted realm, said one of the geologists,

02:36.000 --> 02:41.040
Babbage, quote, successfully asserted the rank in society due to science.

02:42.880 --> 02:51.200
They invented the word science, my friends. The evenings featured dancing, readings, games,

02:51.200 --> 02:56.880
and lectures accompanied by the assortment of seafood, meat, foul, exotic drinks, and ice desserts.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.000
Cheers.

03:03.200 --> 03:09.680
The ladies staged tableaux vivants in which they dressed in costumes to recreate famous paintings.

03:11.040 --> 03:16.320
Astronomers set up telescopes, researchers displayed their electric and magnetic contrivances,

03:16.960 --> 03:22.000
and Babbage allowed guests to play with his mechanical dolls. The centerpiece of the evening,

03:22.000 --> 03:28.240
and one of Babbage's many motives for hosting them, was his demonstration of a model portion

03:28.240 --> 03:35.200
of his, quote, difference engine, a mammoth mechanical calculating contraption that he

03:35.200 --> 03:40.320
was building in the fireproof structure adjacent to his home. Babbage would display the model with

03:40.320 --> 03:45.040
great drama, cranking his arm as it calculated the sequence of numbers, and just as the audience

03:45.040 --> 03:50.480
began to get bored, showed how the pattern could suddenly be changed based on the instructions

03:50.480 --> 03:55.520
that he had coded into the machine. Those who were especially intrigued would be invited through

03:55.520 --> 04:00.400
the yard to the former stables where the complete machine was being constructed.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.680
Babbage's difference engine, which could solve polynomial equations,

04:06.240 --> 04:10.400
impressed people in different ways. The Duke of Wellington commented that it could be useful

04:10.400 --> 04:18.320
in analyzing the variables a general might face before going into battle. Ada's mother, Lord Byron,

04:18.320 --> 04:26.960
marveled that it was a, quote, thinking machine. As for Ada, who would later famously note that

04:26.960 --> 04:32.960
machines could never truly think, a friend who went with them to the demonstration reported,

04:32.960 --> 04:39.520
quote, Ms Byron, young as she was, understood its workings, and she was the, quote, great beauty

04:39.520 --> 04:46.960
of the invention. Ada's love of both poetry and math primed her to see the beauty in the

04:46.960 --> 04:52.240
computing machine. She was an exemplar of the era of romantic science,

04:52.240 --> 04:55.760
which was characterized by a lyrical enthusiasm for invention and discovery.

04:56.560 --> 05:03.040
It was a period that brought, quote, imaginative intensity and excitement to the scientific work,

05:04.080 --> 05:09.520
Richard Holmes wrote in his Age of the Wonder, quote, it was driven by the common ideal of

05:09.520 --> 05:15.440
intense, even reckless personal commitment to discovery, unquote. In short, it was a time

05:15.440 --> 05:20.640
not unlike our own. The advances of the Industrial Revolution, including the steam engine, mechanical

05:20.640 --> 05:26.880
loom, and telegraph, transformed the 19th century in much the same way that the advances of the

05:26.880 --> 05:33.200
digital revolution, the computer, microchip, and the internet have transformed us in our own.

05:34.160 --> 05:38.400
At the heart of both eras were innovators who combined imagination and passion with

05:38.400 --> 05:43.920
wondrous technology, a mix that produced Ada's poetic gulf science, and what the 20th century

05:43.920 --> 05:53.600
poet Richard Rottigan would call, quote, machines of lovely grace. Lord Byron.

05:55.680 --> 06:01.440
Ada inherited her poetic insubordinate temper from her father, but he was not the source of her love

06:01.440 --> 06:07.520
for machinery. He was, in fact, a Luddite. In the maiden speech in the House of Lords, given in

06:07.520 --> 06:14.800
February 1812, when he was about 24, Byron defended the followers of Ned Ludd, who were rampaging

06:14.800 --> 06:21.520
against mechanical weaving machines. With sarcastic scorn, Byron mocked the mill owners of Nottingham,

06:21.520 --> 06:25.920
who were pushing a bill that would have made destroying automated looms a crime punishable

06:25.920 --> 06:31.440
by death, quote, these machines were to them an advantage in so much as they superseded the

06:31.440 --> 06:36.320
necessity of employing a number of workmen who were left in consequence to starve, unquote,

06:36.320 --> 06:41.840
Byron declared. The rejected workmen and the blindness of their ignorance instead of rejoicing

06:41.840 --> 06:46.480
at the improvements in the arts so beneficial to mankind conceived themselves to be sacrificed to

06:46.480 --> 06:53.440
the improvements of the mechanism, end, quote. Two weeks later, Byron published the first two

06:53.440 --> 07:00.640
cantos of his epic poem, Child Harold's Pilgrimage, a romanticized account of his wanderings through

07:00.640 --> 07:06.160
Portugal, Malta and Greece, and, as he later remarked, quote, awoke one morning and found

07:06.160 --> 07:13.600
myself famous, end, quote. Beautiful, seductive, troubled, brooding, and sexually adventurous,

07:14.320 --> 07:20.000
Byron was living a life of a bioronic hero while creating the archetype in his poetry.

07:20.880 --> 07:25.680
He became the toast of literary London and was fed at three parties each day,

07:25.680 --> 07:32.880
most memorable, a lavish morning dance hosted by Lady Caroline Lamb. Lady Caroline, though married

07:32.880 --> 07:38.480
to a political powerful aristocrat who was later prime prime minister, fell madly in love with Byron.

07:39.120 --> 07:44.160
He thought she was, quote, too thin, yet she had an unconventional sexual ambiguity.

07:45.280 --> 07:51.520
She liked to dress like a page boy. He found that enticing. They had a turbulent affair and

07:51.520 --> 07:56.480
after it ended, she stalked him obsessively. She famously declared to him, quote, be mad,

07:56.480 --> 08:04.080
bad, and dangerous to know, which he was. So was she. At Lady Caroline's party, Lord Byron had

08:04.080 --> 08:08.880
also noticed a reserved young woman who was, as he recalled, quote, more simply dressed.

08:09.760 --> 08:16.320
Annabella Milbunk, 19, was from the wealthy and multi-titled family. The night before the party,

08:16.320 --> 08:22.000
she had read Child Harold and had mixed feelings, quote. He is rather too much of a mannerist,

08:22.000 --> 08:28.400
she wrote. He excels most in the delineation of deep feelings. Upon seeing him across the room

08:28.400 --> 08:33.920
at the party, her feelings were conflicted, dangerously so, quote. I did not seek an introduction

08:33.920 --> 08:38.480
to him for all the women were absurdly courting him and trying to deserve a lash of his satire,

08:38.480 --> 08:45.520
she wrote to her mother. I'm not the Cyrus of a place in his laze. I made no offering at the shrine

08:45.520 --> 08:51.040
of Child Harold, though I shall not refuse acquaintance if it comes my way.

08:52.640 --> 08:58.000
That acquaintance, as it turned out, did come her way. After he was introduced to her formally,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.520
Byron decided that she might make a suitable wife. It was for him a rare display of reason over

09:03.520 --> 09:07.920
romanticism. Rather than arousing his passions, she seemed to be the sort of woman who might

09:07.920 --> 09:13.040
tame those passions and protect him from his successes, as well as help him pay off his burdensome

09:13.040 --> 09:21.360
debts. He proposed to her half-heartedly by letter. She sensibly declined. He wanted off to

09:21.360 --> 09:28.080
far less appropriate liaisons, including one with his half-sister, Augustus Lay. But after a year,

09:28.080 --> 09:37.760
Annabella rekindled her courtship. Byron, falling more deeply in debt while gasping for air at the

09:37.760 --> 09:43.520
curb of his enthusiasm, saw the rationale if not the romance in the possible relationship.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.960
Nothing but marriage and a speedy one can save me, he admitted to Annabelle's aunt.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.040
If your niece is obtainable, I should prefer her if not the very first woman who does not

09:55.040 --> 10:01.040
look as if she would spit in my face. There were times when Lord Byron was not a romantic.

10:01.840 --> 10:07.520
He and Annabella were married in January 1915. Byron initiated the marriage in his

10:07.520 --> 10:14.000
Byronic fashion. Had Lady Byron on the sofa before dinner, he wrote in his wedding day journal.

10:15.280 --> 10:19.600
Their relationship was still active when they visited his half-two sisters months later because

10:19.600 --> 10:25.040
around then Annabella got pregnant. However, during the visit, she began to suspect that

10:25.040 --> 10:30.640
her husband's friendships with Augusta had been beyond fraternal, especially after he lay on a sofa

10:30.640 --> 10:37.440
and asked them both to take him, turns kissing him. The marriage started to unravel. Annabella

10:37.440 --> 10:42.960
had been tutored in mathematics, which amused Lord Byron. And during that, he was such a fucking

10:42.960 --> 10:48.960
asshole. Lord Byron was such an asshole, man. And during the court should be a joked about

10:48.960 --> 10:56.400
about his own disdain for the exactitude of numbers. Quote, I know that two and two make four

10:56.400 --> 11:01.280
and should be glad to prove it if I could, he wrote. Though I must say, if any sort of process

11:01.280 --> 11:06.400
like a convert two and two into five, it would give me great pleasure. Early on, he affectionately

11:06.400 --> 11:14.800
dubbed her the quote, Princess of Parallelograms. I want somebody to call me the Princess of Parallelograms.

11:14.800 --> 11:24.160
That's a great name. But when the marriage began to sour, he refined the mathematical image.

11:24.640 --> 11:29.840
We are two parallel lines, prolonged by infinite side by side, but never to meet, he said. Later,

11:29.840 --> 11:36.320
in his first canto of his epic poem, Don One, he would mock her. Her favorite science was the

11:36.320 --> 11:42.880
mathematical. She was a walking calculation. The marriage was not saved by the birth of their

11:42.880 --> 11:51.040
daughter or on December 10th, 1815, which may or may not be my exact birthday.

11:51.680 --> 11:58.880
Some years later, of course, she was named Augusta Ada Byron, her first name that of Byron's

11:58.880 --> 12:04.000
two beloved half sister. When Lady Byron became convinced of her husband's profidity,

12:04.640 --> 12:08.880
she thereafter called her daughter by her middle name. Five weeks later, she packed her belongings

12:08.880 --> 12:15.920
into a carriage and fled into her parents' country home with the infant Ada. Ada never knew her

12:16.400 --> 12:22.160
father again. Lord Byron left the country that April after Lady Byron and led her so

12:22.160 --> 12:30.800
calculating that she earned his subrequette of mathematical media, threatened to expose

12:30.800 --> 12:35.920
his alleged incestuous and homosexual affairs as a way to secure a separation agreement that

12:35.920 --> 12:43.680
gave her custody of their child. The opening of the canto three of Child Harold, written a few

12:44.640 --> 12:53.120
weeks later, invokes Anna as his muse. In thy face, like thy mother's my fair child, Ada,

12:53.120 --> 12:59.360
sole daughter of my house, of my heart. When last I saw thy young blue eyes, they smiled,

13:00.000 --> 13:06.960
and then we parted. Byron wrote these lines in a villa like by Lake Geneva when he was staying

13:06.960 --> 13:15.840
with the poet Percy Beasle Shelley and Shelley's future wife, Mary. It rained relentlessly,

13:15.840 --> 13:21.360
trapped inside for days. Byron, it's like a franchise. It's like an industrial age franchise,

13:22.000 --> 13:27.360
like a movie franchise. He meets the author of Frankenstein. Byron suggested that they write

13:27.360 --> 13:31.440
horror stories. He produced a fragment of the tale about a vampire, one of the first literary

13:31.440 --> 13:36.800
efforts of the subject, but Mary's story was the one that became classic, Frankenstein or

13:37.520 --> 13:43.600
the modern Prometheus. Playing on the ancient Greek myth of the hero who crafted a living man

13:43.600 --> 13:48.160
out of clay and snatched fire from the gods for human use, Frankenstein was the story of a scientist

13:48.160 --> 13:53.120
who galvanized the man made assemblage into a thinking human. It was a cautionary tale about

13:53.120 --> 13:59.120
technology and science and also raised a question that would become associated with Ada. Can man

13:59.120 --> 14:06.560
made machines ever truly think? Third canto of chilled herald ends with Byron's prediction

14:06.560 --> 14:10.800
that Annabella would try to keep Ada from knowing about her father, and so it happened.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.600
There was a portrait of Lord Byron in the house, but Lady Byron kept it securely veiled

14:16.400 --> 14:22.720
and Ada never saw it until she was 20. Lord Byron, by contrast, kept a picture of Ada on his desk

14:22.800 --> 14:29.680
wherever he was, and his letters often requested news or portraits of her. When she was seven,

14:29.680 --> 14:34.640
he wrote to Augusta, quote, I wish you would obtain from Lady B some accounts of Ada's disposition.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.800
Is the girl imaginative? Is she passionate? I hope that the gods have made her anything

14:38.800 --> 14:46.480
save political. It is enough to have one such fool in the family. Lady Byron reported that Ada had

14:46.480 --> 14:51.920
an imagination that was, quote, chiefly exercised in connection with her mechanical ingenuity.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.640
Around the time Byron, who had been wandering through Italy,

14:57.200 --> 15:02.160
writing and having an assortment of affairs, grew bored and decided to enlist in the Greek

15:02.160 --> 15:11.680
struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. He sailed to Missologna, wherever he took command

15:11.680 --> 15:15.920
of the part of the rebel army and prepared to attack the Turkish forces. But before he could

15:15.920 --> 15:20.720
engage in battle, he caught a violent cold that was made worse by the doctor's decision to treat

15:20.720 --> 15:27.920
him by bloodletting. On April 19, 1824, he died. According to his valet among his final words were,

15:27.920 --> 15:34.560
quote, Oh, my poor dear child, my dear Ada, my God, could I have seen her? Give her my blessing.

15:40.000 --> 15:40.400
Ada.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.040
I've been reading the chat, but whatever.

15:50.720 --> 15:56.400
Lord Byron wanted to make sure that Ada did not turn out like her father.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.280
And Byron's strategy was to have the girls rigorously study math,

16:00.240 --> 16:05.840
as if it were an antidote to poetic imagination. When Ada at age five showed a preference for

16:05.840 --> 16:10.640
geography, Lady Byron ordered that the subject be replaced by additional arithmetic lessons,

16:10.640 --> 16:16.560
and her governess soon proudly reported, quote, she adds up sums of five and six rows of figures

16:16.560 --> 16:22.400
with accuracy. Despite these efforts, Ada developed some of her father's propensities.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.480
She had an affair with a young teenager with one of her tutors and with one of her tutors,

16:26.480 --> 16:30.800
and when they were caught and the tutor banished, she tried to run away from the home to be with him.

16:31.440 --> 16:36.240
In addition, she had mood swings that took her from feelings of grandiosity to despair,

16:36.240 --> 16:39.600
and she suffered various maladies, both physical and psychological.

16:40.240 --> 16:45.600
Ada accepted her mother's conviction that the immersion in math could help

16:45.600 --> 16:51.360
pertain her Byronic tendencies. After her dangerous liaison with her tutor and inspired

16:51.360 --> 16:57.200
by Babbage's Difference Engine, she decided on her own at 18 to begin a new series of lessons,

16:57.200 --> 17:02.880
quote, I must cease to think of living for pleasure or self-critification, she wrote to her new tutor.

17:03.680 --> 17:08.400
I find that nothing but very close and intense application of subjects of a scientific nature

17:08.400 --> 17:14.400
now seems to keep my imagination running wild from running wild. It appears to me that the first

17:15.120 --> 17:20.240
thing to go through the course of mathematics, the first thing is to go through a course of

17:20.240 --> 17:27.120
mathematics. He agreed with the prescription. You are right in supposing that your chief resource

17:27.120 --> 17:31.680
and safeguard at the present is the course of severe intellectual study. For this purpose,

17:31.680 --> 17:38.240
there is no subject to be compared to mathematics. The tutor prescribed Euclidean geometry

17:38.240 --> 17:43.040
followed by a dose of trigonometry and algebra. That should cure anyone, they both thought,

17:43.040 --> 17:52.480
from having too much artistic and romantic passion. That's awesome.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.120
Ada's interest in technology was stoked when her mother took her on a trip through the British

18:05.120 --> 18:10.800
industrial midlands to see the new factories and machinery. Ada was particularly impressed with an

18:10.800 --> 18:16.800
automated weaving loom and used punch cards to direct the creation of the desired fabrics the way

18:16.800 --> 18:21.920
she wanted to. That was, by the way, well, we're going to get to it. She drew a sketch of how it

18:21.920 --> 18:26.960
worked. Her father's famous speech in the House of Lords had defended the Luddites who would smash

18:26.960 --> 18:33.520
such looms because of their fear of what technology might do to their humanity, but Ada waxed political

18:33.520 --> 18:37.520
about them and saw the connection with what would someday be called computers.

18:39.600 --> 18:44.000
This machine reminds me of Babbage and the gem of all mechanisms, she wrote.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.480
Ada's interest in applied science was further simulated when she met with one of Bruton's

18:50.480 --> 18:56.720
free you for you noted female mathematician scientists, Mary Somerville. Somerville had

18:56.720 --> 19:01.760
just finished writing one of her great works on the connection of the physical sciences

19:02.400 --> 19:06.240
in which she tied together developments of astronomy, optics, and electricity,

19:06.240 --> 19:11.360
chemistry, physics, botany, and geology. In Blomantic of the Time, it proved in a unified

19:11.360 --> 19:16.160
sense of the extraordinary endeavors of discovery that were underway. She proclaimed in her opening

19:16.160 --> 19:21.920
sentence, quote, the progress of modern science, especially within the last five years, has been

19:21.920 --> 19:27.600
remarkable for a tendency to simplify the laws of nature and to unite detached branches of general

19:27.680 --> 19:33.920
principles. Somerville became a friend, teacher, inspiration, and mentor Ada. She met with Ada

19:33.920 --> 19:40.240
regularly. She sent her math books, devised problems for her to solve, and patiently explained the

19:40.240 --> 19:48.720
correct answers. Mentorship, my friends, mentorship. She was a good friend of Babbage's and during the

19:48.720 --> 19:59.520
fall of 1834, she and Ada would often visit this his Saturday evening solans. Somerville's son,

20:00.640 --> 20:07.840
Wuronzo Greg, aided Ada's efforts to settle down by suggesting to one of his former classmates at

20:07.840 --> 20:12.480
Cambridge that she would make a suitable or at least interesting wife.

20:12.480 --> 20:21.840
William King was socially prominent, financially secure, quietly intelligent,

20:22.400 --> 20:27.200
and as taciturn as Ada was excitable. Like her, he was a student of the science,

20:27.200 --> 20:31.840
but his focus was more practical and less poetic. His primary interests were crop rotation theories

20:31.840 --> 20:36.000
and advances in livestock breeding techniques. He proposed marriage within a few weeks of

20:36.000 --> 20:41.840
meeting Ada, and she accepted. Her mother, with motives that only a psychiatrist could

20:41.840 --> 20:46.240
fast as she could fathom, decided it was imperative to tell William about Ada's attempted

20:46.240 --> 20:51.200
elopement with her tutor. Despite the news, William was willing to proceed with the wedding,

20:51.200 --> 20:57.600
which was held on July 1835. Gracious God, who has so mercifully given you an opportunity

20:57.600 --> 21:03.920
for turning aside the dangerous past, has given you a friend and guardian. Lady Byron wrote her

21:03.920 --> 21:09.680
daughter, adding that she should use this opportunity to quote, bid adieu to all of her

21:09.680 --> 21:18.000
peculiarities, capriciousness, and self-seeking. The marriage was a match made in rational calculus.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.200
For Ada, it offered her a chance to adopt much more steady and grounded life.

21:23.200 --> 21:27.840
More importantly, it allowed her to escape dependence on her domineering mother,

21:27.840 --> 21:32.960
for William had been having a fascinating, eccentric wife from a wealthy and famous family.

21:34.160 --> 21:39.040
Lord Byron's first cousin, Viscut Melbourne, who had the misfortune of having been married

21:39.040 --> 21:44.480
to Lady Caroline Lamb by then deceased, was the prime minister, and he arranged that Queen

21:44.480 --> 21:49.040
Victoria's coronation list of honors, William, would become the Earl of Loveless.

21:50.640 --> 21:57.600
His wife thus became Ada, Countess of Loveless. She is therefore properly referred to as

21:57.600 --> 22:02.000
Ada or Lady Loveless, though she is now commonly known as Ada Loveless.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.600
That Christmas in 1835, Ada received from her mother the most fam- family-side portrait of her

22:07.600 --> 22:12.160
father, painted by Thomas Phillips. It showed Lord Byron in a romantic profile, gazing at the

22:12.160 --> 22:17.040
horizon, dressed in a traditional Albanian costume, featuring a red velvet jacket,

22:17.760 --> 22:23.760
ceremonial sword, and headrest. For years, it had hung over Ada's grandparents' metal,

22:23.760 --> 22:29.360
but it had never been veiled and unseen by the green cloth from the day her parents had separated.

22:29.360 --> 22:36.640
Now she was trusted not only to see it, but to possess it, along with its ink stand and pen.

22:38.320 --> 22:41.520
Her mother did something that was even more surprising when the Loveless first child,

22:41.520 --> 22:46.800
a son, was born. A few months later, despite her disdain for her late husband's memory,

22:46.800 --> 22:54.080
she agreed that Ada should name the boy Byron, which she did. The following year, Ada had a

22:54.080 --> 23:00.800
daughter whom she dutifully named Annabella after her mother. Ada then came down with yet another

23:00.800 --> 23:06.000
mysterious malady, which kept her bedridden for months. She recovered well enough to have a third

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
child, a son named Ralph, but her health remained fragile. She had digestive and respiratory problems,

23:12.560 --> 23:20.080
and these were compounded by being treated with londonum, morphine, and other forms of opium,

23:20.080 --> 23:25.760
which led to mood swings and occasional delusions. Ada was further unsettled by the

23:25.760 --> 23:29.920
eruption of a personal drama that was bizarre enough by the standards of the Byron family.

23:30.560 --> 23:35.040
It involved Madora Le, the daughter of Byron's half-sister and occasional lover.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.240
According to the widely accepted rumors, Madora was Byron's daughter.

23:39.200 --> 23:44.080
She seemed determined to show that that darkness ran in the family. She had an affair with a

23:44.080 --> 23:49.280
sister's husband and then ran off with him to France and had two little limited illegitimate

23:49.280 --> 23:53.840
children. In a fit of self-righteousness, Lady Byron went to France rescue Madora,

23:54.480 --> 23:57.840
then revealed to Ada that the story of her father's incest.

24:00.080 --> 24:06.000
This, quote, most strange and dreadful story did not seem to surprise Ada. I'm not happy

24:06.000 --> 24:09.840
in the least astonished, but I'm not in the least astonished, she wrote to her mother.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.760
You merely confirm that I have known for years and felt scarcely doubt about.

24:14.400 --> 24:18.560
Rather than being outraged, she seemed oddly energized by the news. She declared that she

24:18.560 --> 24:23.760
could relate to her father's defiance authority. Referring to his, quote, misused genius,

24:24.320 --> 24:31.040
she wrote to her mother, quote, if he had transmitted to me any portion of that genius,

24:31.040 --> 24:35.200
I would use it to bring out great truths and principles. I think he has bequested me

24:35.200 --> 24:41.760
this task, in fact. I have this feeling strongly, and there is a pleasure attending to it, end quote.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.000
Once again, Ada took up the study of math in order to settle herself.

24:47.200 --> 24:51.600
She tried to convince Babish to become her tutor. I have a peculiar way of learning,

24:51.600 --> 24:59.040
and I think it is, it must be a peculiar man to teach me, she said, whether due to her opiates

24:59.680 --> 25:06.240
or her breeding or both. She developed a somewhat outsized opinion of her own talents,

25:06.240 --> 25:11.440
and began to describe herself as a genius. In her letter to Babish, she wrote, quote,

25:11.440 --> 25:18.240
do not reckon me conceited, but I believe I have the power of going just as far as I like in such

25:18.240 --> 25:25.120
pursuits. And where were there is no decided a taste, I should almost say a passion as I have

25:25.120 --> 25:29.120
for them. I question if there is not always some portion of natural genius even.

25:31.760 --> 25:38.400
Babish deflected Ada's request, which was probably wise. It preserved their friendship

25:38.400 --> 25:42.640
for an even more important collaboration, and she was able to secure a first-rate math tutor instead,

25:43.280 --> 25:49.120
Augustus de Morgan, a patient gentleman who was pioneer in the field of symbolic logic.

25:49.120 --> 25:54.240
He had propounded a concept that Ada would one day employ with great significance,

25:55.360 --> 26:02.080
which was an algebraic equation could apply to things other than numbers. The relations among

26:02.080 --> 26:07.280
symbols, for example, A plus B equals B plus A, could be part of a logic that applied to things

26:07.280 --> 26:13.680
that were not numerical. And that slammed a calculus, by the way, I've been reading about it.

26:13.680 --> 26:22.560
Oh, great. Love it. Am I drinking? I'm drinking rum.

26:34.880 --> 26:39.120
Ada was never the great mathematician in her canonizer's claim,

26:39.680 --> 26:44.880
but she was an eager pupil able to grasp most of the basic concepts of calculus and with her

26:44.880 --> 26:48.720
artistic sensibility, she liked to visualize the changing curves and trajectories of the

26:48.720 --> 26:53.840
equations being described. De Morgan, her tutor, encouraged her to focus on the rules

26:53.840 --> 26:58.720
for working through equations, but she was more eager to discuss the underlying concepts.

26:58.720 --> 27:03.280
Likewise with geometry, she often asked for visual ways to picture problems,

27:03.280 --> 27:08.480
such as how the intersections of circles in a sphere divided into various shapes.

27:10.080 --> 27:14.560
Ada's ability to appreciate the beauty of mathematics is a gift that eludes many people,

27:15.200 --> 27:19.520
including some who think of themselves as intellectual. She realized that math was a

27:19.520 --> 27:24.400
love, this is a narrator, that she realized that math was a loving language. Well, that described

27:24.400 --> 27:30.240
the harmoniousness of the universe and can be poetic at times. Despite her mother's effort,

27:30.240 --> 27:34.160
she remained her father's daughter with a poetic sensibility that allowed her to view the equations

27:34.240 --> 27:39.280
of the brushstroke that painted an aspect of nature's physical splendor, just as she could

27:39.280 --> 27:45.280
visualize the, quote, wire-dark sea, or a woman who, quote, walks in beauty light at night.

27:46.080 --> 27:52.400
But math's appeal went even deeper for her. It was spiritual. Math constitutes the language

27:52.400 --> 27:58.480
through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of the natural world, she said.

27:58.480 --> 28:05.360
And it allows us to portray, quote, the changes of mutual relationship that unfold in creation.

28:06.160 --> 28:13.440
It is the instrument through which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his creator's works.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.320
This ability to apply imagination to science characterized industrial revolution as well

28:20.320 --> 28:26.320
as the computer revolution, for which Ada was to become a major patron saint. She was able,

28:26.320 --> 28:31.600
as she told Babbage, to understand the connection between poetry and analysis in ways that transcended

28:31.600 --> 28:40.960
her father's talents. I do not believe that my father was or ever could have been such a poet

28:40.960 --> 28:47.920
as I shall be an analyst. For with me, the two go together indissolutably, she wrote.

28:49.120 --> 28:54.480
Her re-engagement with math, she told her mother, spurred her creativity and led to,

28:54.480 --> 29:00.080
and quote, immense development of imagination, so much so that I feel no doubt that I continue my

29:00.080 --> 29:07.120
studies, I shall do in due time become a poet. The whole concept of imagination, especially as it

29:07.120 --> 29:14.480
was a pleasure technology, intrigued her. What is imagination, she asked in 1841. It is the

29:14.480 --> 29:19.840
combining faculty, it brings together things, facts, and ideas, conceptions in new, original,

29:19.840 --> 29:26.400
endless, ever-varying combinations. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us

29:26.400 --> 29:33.920
and the worlds of science. By then Ada believed she possessed special, even supernatural abilities,

29:34.480 --> 29:41.200
what she called, quote, an intuitive perception of hidden things. Her exalted view of her talents

29:41.200 --> 29:46.320
led her to pursue aspirations that were unusual for an aristocratic woman and a mother of the

29:46.320 --> 29:51.360
early Victorian age. Quote, I believe myself to possess a most singular combination of qualities

29:51.360 --> 29:57.360
exactly fitted to make my preeminently a discoverer of the hidden realities of nature, end quote.

29:58.240 --> 30:03.360
She explained in a letter that her mother in 1841, quote, I can throw rays from every

30:03.360 --> 30:10.560
core of the universe into one vast focus. It was while this fame of mine that she just,

30:10.560 --> 30:15.600
it was in this frame of mind that she decided to engage again with Charles Babbage, whose salons

30:15.600 --> 30:24.160
she had first attended eight years earlier. She thinks she's Sheldon. She really does.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.080
This is the innovators from Walter Isaacson.

30:36.800 --> 30:42.800
Charles Babbage and his engines. Probably, this probably be the last one.

30:42.800 --> 30:48.640
From an early age, Charles Babbage had been interested in machinery that could perform human

30:48.640 --> 30:53.280
tests. When he was a child, his mother took him to many of the exhibition halls and numerous

30:53.280 --> 30:59.680
museums that were springing up in London in the early 1800s. At one in Hanover Square,

31:00.960 --> 31:07.440
a proprietor aptly named Merlin, invited him up to the attic workshop where there was a

31:07.440 --> 31:17.120
variety of mechanical dolls known as automata. One was a silver female dancer about a foot tall,

31:17.120 --> 31:23.200
whose arms moved with grace and who held in her hand a bird that could wag its tail,

31:23.200 --> 31:28.560
flip its wings and open its beak. The silver lady's ability to display feelings and personality

31:28.560 --> 31:34.080
captured the boys' fancy. Her eyes were full of imagination, he recalled. Years later, he discovered

31:34.080 --> 31:39.600
the silver lady at a bankruptcy auction and bought it. It served as an amusement at the evening of

31:39.600 --> 31:45.440
salons which he celebrated with wonders of technology later. At Cambridge, Babbage became

31:45.440 --> 31:53.040
friends with groups including John Herschel and George Peacock who were disappointed by the way

31:53.040 --> 31:58.640
math was being taught there. They formed a club called the Analytical Society which campaigned

31:58.640 --> 32:03.440
to get the university to abandon the calculus notation devised by the alumnus Newton which

32:03.440 --> 32:11.200
relied on dots and replaced it with the one devised by Leibniz which used dx and dy to represent

32:12.160 --> 32:18.240
infinitesimally increments in what was known as denotation. Babbage's title the manifesto

32:18.240 --> 32:24.800
quote that principles appear deism in opposition to the dot edge of the university. He was picky

32:24.800 --> 32:31.920
but he had a good sense of humor. One day Babbage was at the Analytical Society's room working on

32:31.920 --> 32:36.320
a table of logarithms that was littered with discrepancies. Herschel asked if him what he was

32:36.320 --> 32:43.200
thinking quote he said, I wish to god these calculations had been executed by steam, Babbage

32:43.200 --> 32:48.080
answered. To this idea of mechanical method for tabulating logarithms Herschel replied,

32:48.800 --> 32:54.960
it is quite possible. In 1821 Babbage turned his attention to building just such a machine.

32:55.920 --> 33:02.000
Over the years many had fiddled with making calculations, contraptions. In the 1640s Blaise

33:02.000 --> 33:06.400
Pascal a French mathematician and philosopher created the mechanism, the mechanical calculator

33:06.400 --> 33:12.080
to reduce the drudgery of his father's work as a tax supervisor. It had spoke metal wheels with

33:12.080 --> 33:17.120
a digits zero through nine on their circumference. To add or subtract numbers the operator used a

33:17.120 --> 33:23.920
stylus to dial a number as if using a rotary phone. Then dialed in the next number and armature

33:24.000 --> 33:30.160
then carried or borrowed a one when necessary. It became the first calculator to be patented

33:30.160 --> 33:36.320
and sold commercially. 30 years later Godfrey Libnitz the German mathematician philosopher

33:36.320 --> 33:41.680
tried to improve upon Pascal's contraption with a quote stepped reckoner that had the capacity

33:41.680 --> 33:48.560
to multiply and divide. It had a hand crake cylinder and a set of teeth that meshed with counting

33:48.560 --> 33:53.200
wheels. But Libnitz ran into a problem that would be a recurring theme for the digital age.

33:53.680 --> 34:00.080
Unlike Pascal and a Duat engineer who could combine scientific theories with mechanical genius

34:00.080 --> 34:04.080
Libnitz had engineering skills that did not surround himself with those who did.

34:04.720 --> 34:10.720
So like many great theories who lacked practical collaborators he was unable to produce reliable

34:10.720 --> 34:15.280
working versions of his device. Nevertheless his core concepts known as the Liebnitz wheel

34:15.920 --> 34:18.800
would influence calculator design through the time of Babbage.

34:18.800 --> 34:25.040
Babbage knew of the devices of Pascal and Libnitz and he was trying to do something better than

34:25.040 --> 34:29.520
them that was more complex. He wanted to construct a mechanical method for tabulating logarithmic

34:29.520 --> 34:34.560
signs and cosines and tangents. To do so he adapted an idea from the French mathematician Gaspar

34:34.560 --> 34:41.520
de Pony who had come up in the 1790s. In order to create logarithmic and trigonometric tables

34:41.520 --> 34:46.320
de Pony broke down the operations into very simple steps that involved the only addition

34:46.320 --> 34:51.760
and mess of traction. Then he provided easy instructions so that the scores of human laborers

34:51.760 --> 34:56.080
who knew the little math could perform these simple tasks and pass along their answers to

34:56.080 --> 35:01.920
the next set of laborers. In other words he created an assembly line the great industrial age

35:01.920 --> 35:07.120
innovation that was memorably analyzed by Adam Smith in his description of the division of labor

35:07.120 --> 35:13.360
in the pin making factory. After a trip to Paris in which he heard of de Pony's method Babbage wrote

35:13.840 --> 35:18.080
I conceived all of a sudden the idea of applying this same method

35:18.080 --> 35:24.560
to the immense work with which I had been burdened and to manufacture logarithms as one manufactures

35:24.560 --> 35:30.960
pins. Even complex mathematical tasks Babbage realized could be broken into steps that came

35:30.960 --> 35:44.560
down into calculating quote finite differences.

35:52.800 --> 35:53.200
All right.

35:54.160 --> 36:01.840
Calculating finite differences through simple adding and subtracting. For example in order to make a table

36:01.840 --> 36:06.480
of squares one to the second two to the second three to second four to the second and so on

36:06.480 --> 36:12.320
you could list the initial numbers in such a sequence one four nine sixteen. This would be column

36:12.320 --> 36:17.440
A. Beside it in column B you could figure out the differences between each and the numbers in this

36:17.440 --> 36:24.320
case three five nine seven and nine. Column C would be a list of differences between the column

36:24.320 --> 36:31.040
B numbers which is two two two and two. Once the process was a simplified it could be reversed

36:31.040 --> 36:39.120
and the task parceled out to untutored laborers. One would be in charge of adding two to the last

36:39.120 --> 36:43.520
number of the column B and then the hand that resulted to the other person would then add the

36:43.520 --> 36:49.120
results to the number A thus generating the next number in the sequence of squares. Babbage

36:49.120 --> 36:54.400
divides the way to mechanize the process and he named it the difference engine. It can tabulate

36:54.400 --> 36:59.200
any polynomial function and provide a number a digital method of approximating the solution to

36:59.200 --> 37:05.600
differential equations. How did it work? The difference engine used vertical shafts with disks

37:05.600 --> 37:10.800
that could be turned to any numeral. They were attached to cogs that would be cranked in order

37:10.800 --> 37:16.240
to add that numeral or to subtract from it a disk on an adjacent shaft. The contraption was even

37:16.240 --> 37:22.560
store the interim result on another shaft. The main complexity was how to carry or borrow when

37:22.560 --> 37:27.200
necessary and what to do with pencils when we calculate the same thing we do with pencils

37:27.200 --> 37:33.040
when we do 36 plus 19 or 42 minus 17. Drawing on Pascal's devices Babbage came up with a few

37:33.600 --> 37:39.440
ingenious contrivances and allowed the cogs and shafts to handle the calculation. The machine

37:39.440 --> 37:43.600
wasn't concept of true marvel. Babbage even figured out a way to get it to create a table

37:43.600 --> 37:48.160
of prime numbers up to 10 million. The British government was impressed and at least initially

37:48.160 --> 37:56.000
in 1823 it gave him a seed money of 1,700 pounds and would eventually sink more than 17,000 pounds

37:56.560 --> 38:01.600
twice the cost of a warship into the device during the decade Babbage spent trying to build it.

38:02.240 --> 38:08.720
But the project ran into two problems. First, Babbage had his hired engineer did not quite

38:08.720 --> 38:14.320
have the skills to get the device working. Second, he began dreaming up something even better.

38:18.080 --> 38:22.320
Babbage's new idea which he conceived in 1834 was a general purpose computer that could carry out

38:22.320 --> 38:27.040
the very a variety of different operations based on programmatic instructions given to it.

38:27.760 --> 38:32.320
It could perform one task and it made a switch to the perform another. It could even tell itself

38:32.320 --> 38:38.640
to switch tasks or alter its quote patterns of action as Babbage called it based on its own

38:38.640 --> 38:45.360
interim calculations. Babbage names this proposed machine the quote analytical engine. He was 100

38:45.360 --> 38:51.040
years ahead of his time. The analytical engine was the product of what Ada Lovelace in her essay of

38:51.040 --> 38:56.960
imagination had called quote the combining faculty. Babbage had combined innovations that had cropped

38:56.960 --> 39:01.840
up in other fields to trick many great inventors have done. He had originally used a metal drum

39:01.840 --> 39:06.000
for what had that was studied with spikes to control the shafts and how they would turn.

39:06.000 --> 39:13.120
Then he studied as Ada had the automated loom invented by 1801 by the Frenchman named Joseph

39:13.120 --> 39:19.600
Marie Jacquard which transformed the silk weaving industry. Looms created a pattern by using hooks

39:19.600 --> 39:25.760
to lift selected warp threads and then a rod pushes a wolf thread underneath. Jacquard invented

39:25.760 --> 39:30.720
a method of using cards with hole punches in order to control this process. The holes determine

39:30.720 --> 39:36.480
which hooks and rods would be activated for each pass of the weave thus automating the creation

39:36.480 --> 39:41.200
of intricate patterns. Each time the shuttle that was thrown to create a new pass of the thread a

39:41.200 --> 39:47.520
new punch card was coming to play. On June 30th 1836 Babbage made an entry into what he called

39:47.520 --> 39:51.680
his quote scribbling books that would represent the milestone in his pre in the prehistory of

39:51.680 --> 39:58.640
computers quote suggested Jacquard's loom as a substitute for the drums. Using punch cards rather

39:58.640 --> 40:03.040
than still drums meant that an unlimited number of instructions could be input into the machine.

40:03.040 --> 40:07.360
In addition the sequence of tasks could be unmodified thus making it easier to devise a

40:07.360 --> 40:13.440
general purpose machine that was versatile and reprogrammable. Babbage brought a portrait of

40:13.440 --> 40:20.400
Jacquard and began to display it at the salons. He showed the inventor sitting in an armchair

40:20.400 --> 40:25.040
loom in the background holding a pair of calipers over irregularly punch cards. Babbage amused his

40:25.120 --> 40:30.560
guest by asking him to guess what it was. Most thought it was a superb engraving. He would then

40:30.560 --> 40:39.440
reveal that it was actually a finely woven silk tapestry with 24,000 rows of threads each controlled

40:39.440 --> 40:46.240
by a different punch card. When Prince Albert the husband of Queen Victoria came to one of

40:46.240 --> 40:52.720
Babbage's salons he asked Babbage why he found the tapestry so interesting. Babbage replied

40:53.520 --> 40:58.640
it will greatly assist in explaining the nature of my calculating machine, the analytical engine.

41:00.160 --> 41:04.320
Few people however saw the beauty of Babbage's proposed new machine as the British government

41:04.320 --> 41:08.880
had no inclination to fund it. Try and see my Babbage head could generate little notice in the

41:08.880 --> 41:14.640
either popular press or the scientific journals but he did find one believer, Ada Loveless,

41:14.640 --> 41:20.000
fully appreciated the concept of the general purpose machine. More importantly she envisioned an

41:20.000 --> 41:27.200
attribute that might make it truly amazing if it could potentially process not only numbers

41:27.200 --> 41:34.080
but any symbolic notation including musical and artistic notes. She saw the poetry in such an

41:34.080 --> 41:39.840
idea and she set out to encourage others to see it as well. She barraged Babbage with letters some

41:39.840 --> 41:46.000
of which verged on cheeky even though he was 24 years her senior and once she described her solitary

41:46.000 --> 41:53.040
game using 26 marbles where the goal is to execute jumps so that only one of the marbles remains.

41:53.920 --> 41:58.640
She had mastered it but was trying to derive a quote mathematical formula on which the solution

41:58.640 --> 42:04.480
depends and which she could put her symbolic language to. Then she asked quote I am too

42:04.480 --> 42:10.960
imaginative for you I think not. Her goal was to work with Babbage as his publicist and partner

42:10.960 --> 42:16.160
in trying to get support to build the analytical engine quote I am very anxious to talk to you

42:16.160 --> 42:23.840
she wrote in a early 1841 quote I will give you a hint on what it strikes me that at some

42:23.840 --> 42:32.400
future time my head may be made by you subservient to some of your proposals and plans if so if ever

42:32.400 --> 42:39.600
I could be worthy of capable of being used by you my head will be yours. A year later a tailor

42:39.600 --> 42:49.040
made opportunity presented itself to the young Eda.
