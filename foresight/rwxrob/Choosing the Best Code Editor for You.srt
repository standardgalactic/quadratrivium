1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
That's some good stuff.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,000
Hey there. Welcome to the stream today. I'm gonna do a little stream about which

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,480
editor you should use first for coding and this is because I have been trying

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,520
to make the decision about what editor to use on the stream as I go forward with

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,600
the rest of the beginner boots and I think it's a big big topic. I've never

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,680
covered it before. I've covered little pieces of it all over the place but I've

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,680
never tackled the topic at large. It's a huge topic. So before I even let the

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,040
crew of hecklers and debaters and you know outlying intelligent people to come

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,200
on here and like make all their cases for whatever thing they use, I just wanted

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,880
to talk to you for a second about you making your own decision about what to

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,040
use and God knows I'm a very opinionated guy and I have a lot of specific

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,400
opinions about this but I wanted to just go ahead and run it all by you. First

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,800
of all though, let me just make one change.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,400
There we go. Much better. Cheers.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,160
A little bit of spike coffee there to get me through this. Actually chai.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,200
The topic of the topic of an editor is a really controversial topic. Everybody

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,680
argues about it all the time. Everybody's right. Everybody's wrong and the bottom

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,040
line is that it comes down to what is the best tool for you and so today we're

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,360
going to talk about three specific types of editors, types of tools that you can

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
use for editing code. A lot of these editors you could use just to edit

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,080
whatever you wanted to and they file into three categories IDEs where they

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,080
call individual development environments, lightweight graphic editors, and terminal

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,120
based editors that you know what if you know me at all you know terminal editing

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,840
is my preference but I want to talk about all of them so that you can kind of

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
speak intelligently about which one is the best to use for a particular task

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,960
and if you're if you're watching this video live stream right now you're

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,440
probably gonna see a graphic for a while but some of there's gonna be other

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
graphics inserted in here to talk about this. So the first editor I wanted to

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,280
talk about is one called Visual Studio and we're gonna we can go ahead and

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,080
look at where to get this and everything. So Visual Studio, let me just put my thing

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:52,400
back on. Visual Studio is the default for most C++ development on Windows and

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,200
from Microsoft and you just do the search for Visual Studio you'll find it. It's

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,720
really important that you understand that Visual Studio is not Visual Studio

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,800
code and we're gonna talk about that that's what that gets under the lightweight

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,520
category. This is a great tool for what it's designed to do which is largely

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,320
work on very big Microsoft applications and some people swear by it and they

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,840
use it all the time. I hate it. I've had to use it on occasion and it's a fun fact

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,800
there's there's somebody who did some analysis on it from Microsoft who

39
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,480
discovered that something like 50,000 lines of code are never even used in the

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,760
codebase. It's the epitome of Microsoft bloat but it is a mandatory tool if

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,800
you're going to be doing anything in C sharp or C++ for Windows. It's just

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,520
it's just really not worth trying to do it in any other way. You certainly can

43
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,680
use other editors for that but that it's really not it's really not worth

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,320
attempting that and so that's one of your choices. If you attend if you're

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,200
going to be doing Unity development or you've been doing something C sharp you

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,960
might want to pick this editor if you can use that. There's another popular

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,520
editor that's been around for a long time by the way Visual Studio has been around

48
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,120
forever. Another editor that's been around for a while is called JetBrains it's

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,600
actually so much an editor as it is a company. IntelliJ is there JetBrains has

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,000
become famous for specifically their IntelliJ editor which has been around

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,160
since the 90s. It's a really good one but this is you know this is your decision

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,800
whether you want to use this or not. Personally if they have they have they

53
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,160
I think they're the ones who did PyCharm. This is a little bit lighter than

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,920
traditional you know integrated development environment than some of the

55
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,160
other ones that are out there but it is it is a thing that you can use and you

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,280
can give it some some consideration. There's Python developers who absolutely

57
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,520
swear by PyCharm. I would never ever use it but you know that might

58
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,920
be you. I want to say there's there's another one in that branch that's called

59
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,320
GoLand which is the other thing too is you get language specific ID's yeah

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,760
there we go. GoLand is the JetBrains ID. This is one I've heard rave reviews

61
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,520
on. Petit Jolliway check really loves it. One of the most famous converts from

62
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,960
Node to Go. He uses it. He was raving about it. A lot of people really like it.

63
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,600
It's got great theming and everything and frankly if you're going to be

64
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,560
developing in a specific language in fact somebody who recently got a job with

65
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,920
a company that does go development they this is their go-to editor. It's not

66
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,200
mandated but it's really encouraged that you use it. I have been to be a fan of

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,200
the idea of having if you're going to have a graphic editor that you have a

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,920
graphic editor that's highly customized for your whatever it is that you're

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,320
developing and so this would be one you might consider if you're going to do

70
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,280
go development. PyCharm is that way and frankly JetBrains as a company has made

71
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,200
kind of a business out of creating editors for specific languages the first

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,680
being IntelliJ which they was a worldwide hit. I believe IntelliJ then

73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
went on to become the standard native application development tool for

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Android and you know with 39% of all internet traffic going to Android

75
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,240
phones with Chrome now that's a significant choice. So if you're going

76
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,000
to pick an editor you might want to consider JetBrains for that. There's

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
one that I have to mention that I absolutely despise mostly because I

78
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,760
had to use it. I was forced to use it. This we got really popular. It's called

79
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,880
Eclipse and there would be groans in the audience if they could if they could if

80
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,880
they could hear that you could hear them right now. Eclipse is probably one of

81
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,960
the most notoriously bloated and horrible integrated development

82
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,200
environments on the planet as far as I'm concerned. However it is everywhere.

83
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,880
There's an Eclipse foundation and there's I mean it's been everywhere since the

84
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,880
90s because Eclipse got really popular because it was really the first

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,120
substantial Java editor written in Java and Eclipse itself has gone on to be

86
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,800
embedded in applications because of its framework. IBM for example same time

87
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,400
their chat client is an entire Eclipse instance with Java built in. It's one of

88
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,120
the most bloated pieces of crap I've ever used and not just that but Lotus was

89
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,440
the same way and you see a lot of things around that still use Eclipse for

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,360
lots of reasons then you're likely to encounter it if you're doing any Java

91
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,160
development and particularly even in Minecraft if you're doing Minecraft

92
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,040
development. If I had a choice and I was going to be doing Java development

93
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,840
which I would never choose to do I would you know I would probably be reaching

94
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,240
for IntelliJ over Eclipse but again you might not have that choice and Eclipse

95
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,720
is super famous for having all the things integrated into it and it's really

96
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,360
popular with enterprises. So they've developed a lot of enterprise tools

97
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,440
that use it and a lot of times I'll mandate that use it. When I was at IBM I

98
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,120
had to use Eclipse and I figured out ways to get around that and use VI under the

99
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,400
hood so that I could just use Eclipse for the things that Eclipse had to be used

100
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,600
for for like committing code into the source tree and stuff like that. So again

101
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,080
we that's those are the those are the only individual development environments

102
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm going to cover just to give you an introduction to them so you know about

103
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,560
them. This is you know beginner boost material here so I'm assuming that you

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,760
don't know anything about editors and maybe you've heard somebody say you need

105
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,480
to learn this and you need to know this and hopefully this will help you make

106
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,720
your own decision. The next category of editors is actually the lightweight

107
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:36,280
text editors. There was something of a revolution started by Sublime and it was

108
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,480
the first so I talked about this before I'm doing it again though because I feel

109
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:47,280
like it's important to do it in a more succinct way. So Sublime text is still I

110
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,600
believe the fastest visual lightweight editor in class. There's still people

111
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
who really love it but it has fallen out of favor for two well three main reasons

112
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,120
the first main reason is that it's highly proprietary. You can use it but

113
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,200
you're supposed to buy it. Number two you can't extend it and there's there's

114
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,800
almost like yelling at each other flame wars in in the support forums because

115
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,240
the person who maintains it which I shall not name can't doesn't listen to

116
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,280
anybody does whatever he wants and and and the people who are trying to expand

117
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,080
it and do their own thing just can't and they're just so frustrated that this

118
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,680
project this part of this product which was so great is just completely not

119
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,080
available to anybody to extend or use. Now you can write Python plugins and

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,840
things like that. A lot of people do that. And the third thing the fourth thing is

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,520
it's it's all Python. It's Python and C and so extending it is is you know even

122
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,800
if you could it would be really tough to do it. I think it's C++ actually but

123
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,480
fastest editor on the planet for a very long time in the graphics category

124
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,160
you know short of like really simple ones and we'll get to those two. This is a

125
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,080
little bit across between you know the whatever the editor is on your computer

126
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,600
and I don't need to tell you that about you know notepad or simple text or

127
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,960
whatever the editor is it comes on your computer just a plain old text editor

128
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,120
which by the way Jennifer recommends in learning web design you just use that

129
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,920
and that's actually how I learned web design in like what 95 or so I actually

130
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,280
coded my first HTML using simple text on a Mac and that's totally fine. It didn't

131
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,120
have any syntax highlighting you know as a whole world opening up to me after

132
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,960
that point so don't feel bad if that's all you know and then if you have if you

133
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,920
have pop OS or Linux of any kind that the built-in graphic editor is pretty dang

134
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,000
good the text editor so we're going to stick with those are all lightweight

135
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,480
but that's really ultra lightweight right so in between ultra lightweight which

136
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,840
is just text editing and nothing to do with code and the big fat behemoth IDEs

137
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,400
you have these light this lightweight brand of editor called Sublime Text

138
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,120
which is the first one and I'm very gonna quickly gonna go through the

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,800
history of that so after Sublime Text came out and had its problems that I

140
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:14,160
mentioned people ran to Adam and Adam was that it was was GitHub's answer to

141
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,040
Sublime it was an editor developed by GitHub before they were consumed by

142
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,760
Microsoft and it was designed entirely to use JavaScript in fact the entire

143
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,680
Electron API which people love the bag on now because it is responsible for

144
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,960
Eclipse Slack God how many more I mean there's so many applications that have

145
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,080
Electron built into them now and Electron is the framework that was built to

146
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:49,240
build out of them primarily oh boy what did I just search for Electron so so we

147
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,000
have Electron here I probably should say engine or something no which I say

148
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,760
framework Electron gets a really bad black eye these days because so many

149
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,200
people make very simple applications that have an entire Electron you know

150
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,280
framework built into them Electron just wondering is the combination of the

151
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:18,200
Chrome web browser and some a web server that by default I think is node and

152
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,440
and the stuff to talk between the two so it's basically like you have a little

153
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,920
miniature web server and web browser all built into one and that way you don't

154
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
you know it's it's kind of like a web application so so you'll get you're

155
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
gonna hear a lot more about Electron I actually have done a video on Electron if

156
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,040
you can go search up on my YouTube but it's important you understand that

157
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,720
Electron was created to make Adam and as soon as Electron came up you know

158
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,600
everyone's like well maybe we can do better so and it was JavaScript it was

159
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,440
really slow compared to Sublime it's still slow compared to Sublime but Adam

160
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,880
was really lighter than the IDEs and it was extensively using JavaScript which

161
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,880
made it really popular with a lot of people really fast it's still really

162
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:10,680
popular actually and and then you have brackets so so brackets was Adobe Adobe's

163
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,760
answer to this they said hey we want to make one and I'm almost positive that

164
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,640
it's running off the Electron editor but the Electron framework but I can't

165
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,960
confirm that right now and it basically the same idea it's just Adobe style

166
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,160
different approach you know Adobe I guess wanted to do their own for some

167
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,160
reason I've never met anybody who uses brackets who's not a big die-hard Adobe

168
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,640
fanatic and you know what I'm talking about they are there but that exists and

169
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,920
so that's one of the one of those and then sometime after that Microsoft

170
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,240
decided to get into the game and they said you know what let's make code visual

171
00:13:51,240 --> 00:14:00,520
studio code VS code so that's code.mic let's see code.visualstudio I think it

172
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,520
is yeah code.visualstudio.com now this you know they could they had an

173
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,280
opportunity to really clean things up but they did it and they named it visual

174
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,040
studio code instead of visual studio and this has created crazy confusion for

175
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,120
beginners I don't know how many times somebody's downloaded visual studio

176
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,480
instead of visual studio code because the icons are similar they wanted to just

177
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,800
carry on their branding and maybe you know make people think that visual studio

178
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,920
is actually not the horrible bloated piece of crap that it is and so they you

179
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,400
know they added code in the front of it and it's really tough but just make sure

180
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,760
you go to code.visualstudio this is the number one editor on the planet right

181
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,680
now hands down by every measure this is what most code is being written in

182
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,040
Microsoft does know developers and they they're pretty good at making editors

183
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,280
and so they released they did a lot of things that weren't very Microsofty at

184
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,240
the time fact you could argue that this was the beginning of the new Microsoft

185
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,080
under Sanjay that you know really really embraces open source and as far as we

186
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,360
know and they released this to the world and said here's our version and we're

187
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,440
using Electron and ours is faster than Adam and we still use some techniques

188
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,760
that are the same they have their own plugin architecture which is very very

189
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,160
rich right now and people go crazy over this thing there's people who love

190
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,120
completion I despise that and there's you know it's just really popular with a

191
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,000
lot of people this is the editor that I usually have beginners use so if you're

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,560
just coming to the booths for the first time and you've never done any editing

193
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,440
and you don't particularly want to you know rack your brain learning a more

194
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,680
difficult editor that I'm going to talk about in a second this is the editor

195
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,640
that I recommend you pull out either this one or Adam chances are the VS code

196
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,360
is going to be more fun for you out of the gate one of the things that VS code

197
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,320
does very very well as it integrates with with other services that github now

198
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,120
I mean that Microsoft now owns Microsoft bought github and at that meant that they

199
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,520
also bought the Adam editor it's open source but you know and they bought

200
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,560
control of this code and they got all the 10 million developers just so that

201
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,280
we're you know committing to get him all the time and that's very good 7.8

202
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,880
billion dollars they paid I believe and that's a very controversial decision and

203
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,960
that's that was that was after Git lab came out but I'm going down kind of a

204
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,920
rabbit hole there but just understand that this is still under Microsoft's

205
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,840
control the future looks pretty bright for Visual Studio code because Microsoft

206
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,520
does control it other than the fact that they're probably going to blow it out

207
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,240
like they do everything else it it it is integrated very tightly with with

208
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,040
github which is the world's leading source repository even though it's not my

209
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,920
favorite and that's a depth separate conversation I use Git lab for everything

210
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,880
and so that's I'm going to kind of conclude on that except but one other

211
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
thing Visual Studio code has Microsoft's

212
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,160
limitry that's embedded in it that you have to actively go in and find and

213
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,880
turn off and nobody does by default so I can't recommend an off that you at least

214
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:11,320
give VS code in the try VS code him and you can go find it it's actually if

215
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,480
you're using pop a West like me you can just search for it and it'll it'll you

216
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,880
know it this is what it looks like it's exactly the same we're not gonna run it

217
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,280
right now but so so that's what we're looking at and you can download VS

218
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,400
code him all this podium is it's exactly the same project thank God for open

219
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,800
source right it is VS code in every way it's just had all of the telemetry the

220
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,480
tracking and privacy violation and stuff that it is activated by default in

221
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,280
Microsoft's tool there are some things that don't work in it I've heard but for

222
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,880
the most part I think you're gonna be fine to use this I have not well other

223
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,680
than the other day I haven't given a lot of work but I have used this code for

224
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,720
more than a year and a half at one point I was a total convert to VS code and I

225
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,720
actually gave up my favorite editor of all time them for VS code for a good

226
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,000
year and a half and I did a video on that ultimately though I concluded that

227
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,200
even a lightweight text editor for me is is just too heavy and too slow and and

228
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,160
people take great exception with that but but I am not a graphic editor I

229
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,640
never have been because the terminal is always going to be faster I can I could

230
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,720
argue all day that the terminal on every level is faster than any graphic

231
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,240
application period just from the trips that you have to make over to the mouse

232
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,360
all the time and however to use a terminal editor today is is you know it's a

233
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,320
craft you have to like practice it just like the piano or something you can't

234
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,280
just jump in and use it it's pretty hard so let's shift our gears now to the

235
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,480
terminal editors and I want to talk about those and a little bit of the

236
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,000
history of the terminal editors this is that the terminal editors are my favorite

237
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,120
and after that year of VS code it was my own people then my own community

238
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,160
reminded me to that that it was still faster to start up files and everything

239
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,480
with vi and and I it is it's just better so based on that we're going to go back

240
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,720
and I'm going to pull up the chat I'm sure we're going to have all kinds of

241
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,960
people in the chat talking right now but before we do that I just wanted to tell

242
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,520
you about them I think I can probably go pull up so that I have to give you a

243
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,320
quick history on the editors here so this let me go back to the title screen

244
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,960
for sec alright so so when it comes to when it comes to terminal editors you

245
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,640
have to go back into the history of terminal editor and know what a terminal

246
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:39,320
is first of all a terminal is the thing that you get when you fire up I'm

247
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:47,560
firing up one right now so you guys can see so this is a terminal editor and I'm

248
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,200
going to show you this actually give me a second I'm going to make it a big screen

249
00:19:52,200 --> 00:20:02,440
when it changes one to be so that it hides stuff and I'm going to go into

250
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,400
preferences at the thing about terminals is that you can set their colors and

251
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,280
everything and I just just want to set that to something that's very readable

252
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,120
for right now instead of the transparency just so you can read it I mean I love

253
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,640
transparency don't get me wrong but it's a little hard to read sometime all

254
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,960
right so so we'll do that and then we'll bring this guy make this thing full

255
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:31,200
screen alright so actually yeah let's do that so if I bring you back if I bring

256
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,080
us back to to here you see you just get a plain terminal there's nothing going

257
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,500
on it's just a terminal and terminals can be really scary if you don't know

258
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,440
about them you haven't used them before but they're very powerful and we're gonna

259
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,240
talk about terminals at another time we're gonna talk not gonna talk about

260
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,360
terminals right now but I did want to introduce you to different kinds of

261
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,480
terminals so the first terminal is ed and it's actually you could argue that it

262
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,920
was the first terminal ever made X I think predates it but and it is a line

263
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,600
editor and I mean Ed like this Ed and it lets you like you can set in commands

264
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,520
and those commands will it will adjust each line of a file that's coming in and

265
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,560
I don't want to spend time with any of the editor showing you because I know

266
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,240
it'll take too much time and but the second editor after Ed was it what

267
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,440
editor called VI and VI stood for visual mode of X or Ed and so it was in the

268
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,560
other one just allowed you to change one line at a time and and VI let you have

269
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,880
like a whole screen and to just let you see what that looks like so I mean where

270
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,560
are we right now we could probably do damp some md and you see you get you get

271
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,680
this screen this is actually them and we're talking about that but you get

272
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,880
the screen you can type stuff in here and save it and and such right and so

273
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,080
that was visual mode we see how it took out the whole screen so via and actually

274
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,160
there is another I don't think I have it installed but let me do this really

275
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:12,400
quick install and VI and you got to do my password there and there we go

276
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,240
we'll install this really fast our package is great package systems alright

277
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:25,400
so so now I can do the same thing I can do and VI and this is this is NVI is

278
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,160
the original VI there is no you can't get the original VI usually these days

279
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,960
it's really hard to find unless you're using a really old computer most

280
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,140
computers come with command call VI which is aliased to a modern version of

281
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:45,440
it called them they VI improved but the original VI is is is represented in a

282
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,840
program called NVI not to be confused with Neil them and we'll talk about them

283
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,240
and you have them in a second so NVI is a want bug for bug compatible version of

284
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,040
the original VI that came on Unix systems from the dawn of time and and it

285
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,280
continues to be the default editor right here on BSD Unix which is a different

286
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,000
you know kind of operating system we're talking about today but all this

287
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,920
terminal stuff originated with Unix actually Minix and we can go back but

288
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,560
for all intents and purposes Unix was the very first time and you know in

289
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,400
college campuses this was sort of used and then Lennox came about this isn't a

290
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,960
terminal history class right now but we'll talk about later so so this the

291
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,720
question comes up well so what should I use should I use VI and you know or

292
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,000
should I use them so the next generation of editors that came out after this was

293
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,680
the thing called VIM and VIM is just improved VI and and and then to and it

294
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,920
attempts to improve upon that yet another version of them came out called

295
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,160
Neo VIM and rumor has it there's another one called space VIM now which I am not

296
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,360
interested at all I'm not interested at all in the OVM and I actually strongly

297
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,200
discourage you from using it for reasons that I can describe you think I can

298
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,000
send you to my blog post about why you might not want to use it VIM however is

299
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,320
my favorite and and because VIM gives you all the power of customization of your

300
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,680
command line terminal and why would you use a terminal on the command line the

301
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,640
single biggest answer to that is in the case of VI or VIM it's because you can

302
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,960
fully integrate your computer's terminal power into your editor and while you can

303
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,320
pull up a terminal in VS code that is not necessarily the case right you it's a

304
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,720
lot harder to do you can do it but it's not as obvious so you know if you learn

305
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,000
VI and you don't learn or VIM and you don't learn how to integrate the shell

306
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,800
commands and be able to write really quick little shell scripts in order to do

307
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,080
things or you don't learn how to use macros which I took a long time to do

308
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,600
because I was a sort of a VI purist for a very long time you know you haven't

309
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,840
really learned them and you're not gonna really understand a lot of its

310
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,760
advantages you'll just be frustrated because you can't exit you can't escape

311
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,960
which is you know big joke out there so but if you do allow yourself to do the

312
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,400
things you can you you can make the most powerful editor you can imagine in

313
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,160
fact when combined with a really amazing shell like bash and a multi a terminal

314
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,480
multiplexer which allows you to split your screen up into pieces like Tmux you

315
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,400
have what I believe is a far more powerful individual development

316
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,720
environment with without the bloke it's the most efficient way to do editing of

317
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,400
all time not only that but it works everywhere and so I before we go to the

318
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,520
other terminal options I just want to say that VI is installed on every VR

319
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,720
Vim is installed on every Unix and Linux system for the last like 50 years and so

320
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,160
if you are going to be in a situation where you just need to attach to a cloud

321
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,160
machine with you know headless that means it doesn't have a graphic user

322
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,840
interface and you want to be able to apply what you're going to do there you

323
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,520
you just want to learn them or VI and you just you just do because that way

324
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,480
you can make it you can be effective anywhere if you're going to be a hacker

325
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,480
you really need to learn VI if you're gonna be a hacker you need to learn Ed

326
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,160
also because a lot of times when you break into a system you don't even have

327
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,840
that big fancy screen all you have is one line at a time and that therefore Ed

328
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,760
comes in really handy because Ed allows you to edit files there's other ways to

329
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,640
edit files but but Ed that would that's a really strong case for you to learn Ed

330
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,040
if you're just like wanting to be a web developer or you're wanting to just write

331
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,240
you know some go-co for some reason or you know or for whatever you know edit

332
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,840
pod files for Kubernetes or something that that is you know not necessarily a

333
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,720
reason to learn Ed but VI doesn't hurt because it works everywhere but that

334
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,560
brings us to the next option but speaking of defaults some time ago the

335
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,240
Linux foundation and all the Linux people decided to get rid of VI as the

336
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,200
default they didn't take VI off but they they stopped making VI the default

337
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,800
editor and they started using something called Nano which I actually despise but

338
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,480
I understand why people need to use it to get going the reason I despise this

339
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,600
editor and you see me using my my my my my just you know like writing and then

340
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,260
pushing backspace and stuff like that this this nano is by the way is an

341
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,780
is a is a newer version of Pico which has been around for a while and these got

342
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,660
really popular because they were used for mail processing back in the day when

343
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,500
you would use a terminal for mail so people remember them and it is

344
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,380
definitely more intuitive to a beginner but you really have to span the arrow

345
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,500
keys you can't navigate around you can't really integrate your shell you sort of

346
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,180
can and the most annoying thing of all here is that it encourages you to use

347
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,260
control X to exit and and that just the the the see all these things down here

348
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,940
that begin with a carrot those are all as you know control things and and I just

349
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,100
I just really don't like the use of control characters but now I've been

350
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,500
overruled everybody everybody on the planet thinks nano should be the default

351
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,900
editor on Linux now and now now it is to be fair sometimes you would do

352
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,380
something that was really important like you'd be editing you know a scheduler

353
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,340
file and cron job and you would go to edit it and it would throw into vi and

354
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,300
if you didn't know vi you were in trouble because now you couldn't exit

355
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,980
you didn't know how to exit there's no help there's no menu you couldn't get

356
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,420
out of it and that's like a long time you know joke in that in that world in the

357
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:41,540
world of of vi so so that's why nano is there I can't in good conscious

358
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,900
recommend nano if you're going to use a terminal because the whole reason for

359
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,500
using the terminal is to make it take advantage of the terminal and its

360
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,820
integration with the shell and so that brings us to yet another option which is

361
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,580
very popular with with academics and and and hard hardcore coders and

362
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,900
Linus Torvalds you made Linux and many many other really you know substantial

363
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,540
developers and that's emacs and and I actually do not like emacs I I played

364
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,740
around those emacs curious for a while the reason I'm gonna before I get into

365
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,500
emacs I don't think I could operate it I don't even know if it's on here yeah let

366
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,820
me check and see nope it's not even on here I have to install I that I'm not

367
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,780
going to install I'm not gonna waste your time I would be totally lost using it

368
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,420
some people swear by it people joke and say a max is in an editor it's an

369
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,860
operating system and the reason for that is because emacs was developed

370
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,580
primarily by a guy named amateur stallman who wrote most of the C code for

371
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:50,780
the utilities that use along with Linux the GNU core utilities he's the guy who

372
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,820
says you should call everything GNU Linux instead of Linux because he believes

373
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:01,140
his contribution outweighed the Linux kernel itself as well as everybody else's

374
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,380
contribution to the whole Linux system which I totally disagree with but but

375
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,860
he you know made emacs and and emacs is still popular in most of all is using

376
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,500
something called microlinux apparently and the the attraction from emacs is

377
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:22,260
that it can be customized it's it's it's it's basically the heaviest possible

378
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,260
terminal application you can run for editing anything and it's not just

379
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,500
editing you can like change your file system you can they've got so many

380
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,420
plugins to make it do so many different things they've even got stuff that makes

381
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,060
it behave like vi if you want and and for some people they really love that you

382
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:43,700
gotta understand that that was a thing when terminals were the only thing in

383
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,260
the house emacs was like really powerful I mean it was really powerful back then

384
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,020
there was no tmux you couldn't split panes up you had screen which allowed

385
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,700
you to have different windows and cut and paste in text back and forth but but a

386
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,860
tool like emacs at the time was I could see how it would be really compelling

387
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,780
particularly because there wasn't no network yet so you know even before

388
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,820
networking existed emacs existed right so but nowadays when we pick a

389
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,980
terminal editor I believe you're picking a terminal editor because you want to be

390
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,460
fast you want to integrate the shell commands and you want to be able to use

391
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,740
your editor anywhere as fast as possible you don't want to wait up for things to

392
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,580
start up and and by the way that means that you can't take your big fancy emacs

393
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,740
configuration with you you've got to know how to be how to edit files on

394
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,700
remote systems without all that it doesn't take very much to copy over that

395
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,260
to a system but you might not even have permissions to do that in certain

396
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,940
enterprise environments you have to have a change ticket to do that and so that's

397
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,580
my my take on it becoming proficient with vi first and then vim allowing

398
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,500
yourself to use the extra vimisms which I finally gave in on allows you to be you

399
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,500
know have the the efficiencies of of emacs locally but and you know and

400
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,700
build it and basically an IDE by combining bash you know vim and and you

401
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:12,540
know tmux but it also allows you to be to use the same fingers and operations

402
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,740
you know think muscle memory on any system anywhere and emacs doesn't allow

403
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,580
that you'd have to install it as you just saw on all those systems to be able to

404
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,380
use it so so I believe that's a big strike against emacs for anyone who

405
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,740
wants to use more than one computer if you're gonna spend what you're just do

406
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,460
it you're an astrophysicist you're gonna just work on one computer the whole

407
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,180
time and you want to be able to write your own plugins and everything and all

408
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,860
this stuff and then you max might be might be your option there and and by

409
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,420
the way another reason to use vi is because the bindings for vi are built

410
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:50,260
into everything so the use of hjknl for navigating through the history is the

411
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:56,660
thing right and by default the the terminal and Linux is set to back to emacs

412
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,100
mode so it's as if you're interacting with an emacs session but if you do set

413
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,700
that show vi you can use that you can use vi mode there is no nano mode or

414
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,060
anything like that and you'll come to really appreciate that because your

415
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,500
fingers will memorize things from the terminal that carry over into your

416
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,860
editor and that didn't goes into like terminal terminal browsing like when I

417
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,260
when I browse you know when I browse the website I'm using one hand and I'm

418
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,580
using the same vi navigation keys because those are once again you know

419
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:30,660
built-in and it's very common to encounter you know terminal software

420
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:37,620
that has Vim bindings you can even do a thing called Vim Vimium which can work

421
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,740
in Chrome as a program plugin allow you to navigate your graphics browser without

422
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,380
touching your mouse at all you can just stay there and do vi sorts of things I'm

423
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,500
sure similar things exist in to for the emacs kind of people but as I've said

424
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,780
from the beginning you know there's different stages here and if you're

425
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,740
just starting out and you don't know what to use and you don't want to use text

426
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,900
edit anymore you know the first pick I would say it'd be VS code it's very

427
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,100
intuitive it uses the mouse you it's what you see is what you get but if you

428
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,660
want to you know move into the terminal you're eventually going to have to move

429
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,380
into the terminal just there's just not very much not even in the web development

430
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,620
front-end world there's not very much that doesn't force you at some point to

431
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,380
go on to a terminal to do something and I'm not going to go into all those

432
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,980
reasons you would have to use a terminal but these days using a terminal is sort

433
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,620
of mandatory skill for a technologist and the particularly in the cloud

434
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:33,140
environment and because it's just ubiquitous it's just everywhere it gives

435
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:38,100
you so much power and so if that is true you know and you have to use it you

436
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,020
might as well I think you might as well learn the best editor for the terminal

437
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,620
on any terminal so that you can be productive no matter what and if you

438
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,140
want to take it up a notch and use emacs some people use emacs and vi

439
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:58,020
there's a couple of really great BSD people in here who use they'll use emacs

440
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,260
and they'll also you vi depending on what system they're on and that's only

441
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,420
two terminal editors to learn that's not too bad in a way you're going to be

442
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,620
able to do a VS code on that by the way just just say no to all of the remote

443
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,380
editing crap that's coming out in VS code and all these graphic editors that are

444
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,500
claiming to be able to integrate remote file editing what they're doing is under

445
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,340
the hood they're copying down a file copy allowing you to edit it and then

446
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,220
they're synchronizing up that copy to the server there's so many things that

447
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:33,780
can go wrong with that I just can't even begin to comprehend all the possible

448
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,380
things that could go wrong with that and if you are in charge of editing files

449
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,460
on a remote system first of all why are you doing that right you should be

450
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,340
staging it if you are somehow doing that one of the legitimate reasons to be

451
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,260
doing that would be responding to an emergency as I did many times you know

452
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,980
working as a system administrator and when you have to remotely connect to a

453
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,060
system and edit files there the last thing you want in the way is a visual

454
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,940
editor that's run by Microsoft I mean that I can't even begin to imagine the

455
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,500
terror of trying to be a system administrator and do that so you know

456
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,500
just if you're if that's where you're headed in cybersecurity and say

457
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,300
in the system of engineering and even you know full-stack development as opposed

458
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,940
to just running engineering then I would eventually move off of this code you

459
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,820
can still use it you know if you want to do you know big web projects it's

460
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,380
really good for that but if you if you're gonna start you know getting

461
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,540
serious about development see see development is pretty much all on the

462
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,140
command line that's kind of the culture you can do it in BS code but you know

463
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,260
using make files all this stuff you're gonna need to learn the terminal so I

464
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:44,980
would say you know probably 70 to 80% of all the careers in technology involve

465
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,500
the terminal and of those careers you know probably 50 of those percent of

466
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,340
those careers involve using a terminal on multiple computers without having an

467
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,380
editor installed on them that you would stall and therefore my justification is

468
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,780
learn Vi and then learn them and if you want to do that I will do videos on how

469
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,380
to do that how to learn Vi a little bit of a spoiler here though if you want to

470
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,700
just jump right in with Vi you can actually go read the little guide I made

471
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:20,460
called Vi Survive so you can go rwx.gg slash Vi Survive and this is just the

472
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,540
minimum you need to know to get around to Vi and this does or VIM and this does

473
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,180
make use of the arrow keys because if you're using nano and you want to get

474
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,700
started with Vi and not start with nano this is the way to do it this is the way

475
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:39,140
to do it rwx.gg slash Vi Survive and that I'll talk you through how to how to

476
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,140
just you know use Vi as if it were nano and then you can slowly add on more

477
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,980
skills that's how Vi learning works I'll do the different videos on Vi

478
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,740
specifically as part of the terminal mastery series but I just wanted to do

479
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,580
this one on editing all right so that concludes this video I'm going to turn

480
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,220
and take some comments I'm sure I'm sure that I'm sure the forums are full of

481
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,820
the comments are full of people raging about different things that I've said

482
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:10,100
here and as I've said all along be your own person be a critical thinker do your

483
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,180
own analysis for your own needs and make your own decision don't take my word for

484
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:21,620
it don't take their word for it don't let any pedantic argumentative jerk decide

485
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,220
for you what's best for you and that includes me because I can be that guy so

486
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,260
you make your own decision but taking a bunch of information make an informed

487
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,820
dependence and be ready to change your opinion when you have new opinions when

488
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,700
you have new information but don't don't let anyone shame you because you're

489
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,980
using the wrong editor and by the way if I ever do that I'm always joking right I

490
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,620
do I have fun we all have fun but but and that's that's fine that's the part

491
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:51,020
of natural natural healthy debate but but you know just take that with a great

492
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,580
assault when we do that I'm gonna turn to the chat now at at potentially what

493
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:02,740
will be my peril so I'm gonna put that on here so here we go Pico Pico came

494
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,900
with pine oh yeah Pico was a pine pine was a male editor no nano yeah I made a

495
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,460
thing about nano

496
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,700
you max always makes me picture emack Mendy the people the problem with emacs

497
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,740
is the same as the clips people are already making emacs based applications

498
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,380
are they really didn't know that when I browse the lips that I'm using one hand

499
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:34,180
yeah I know that sounds pretty funny doesn't PG just quoting I walk into

500
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,740
those things all the time obviously I didn't mean it I'm browsing a text-based

501
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:46,580
website so yeah text oh you're the vimeo you're thinking you're talking about

502
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,060
vimeo okay why don't you know them neo van is a disaster that never needed to be

503
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,860
made and and has been completely superseded by all of the additions that

504
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:04,220
been made and I'm gonna just if you want to get my my full story on them let me

505
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:13,780
just on on Neil them I can give that to you here so if you go to no pet or noob

506
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,100
G Vim I'm not a fan of graphics Vim although somebody informed me the other

507
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:25,540
day that you can interact with the shell using graphics G Vim but to me that

508
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,020
defeats the whole entire purpose of using them at all if you're using Vim you

509
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,860
want to integrate the shell and if you're using Vim on Windows with no bash

510
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,420
shell I think it's a waste so I don't that's not the way God intended it to be

511
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:45,620
used this put it that way many have keyboard shortcuts yes have Vim

512
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,460
shortcuts yes I like using a terminal but never really use terminal editors for

513
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,740
anything other than reading manual pages well that's not an editor in the

514
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,540
first place you're not you're not you're not using an editor to read a man page

515
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,020
you're using a pager they're like less or more I think remote editing is

516
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,420
sometimes used for working on a machine that is much more powerful for huge

517
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,140
coach bases with specialized hardware I could see that right that might be that

518
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:14,500
may be fine that might be an use case for that otherwise not a fan of that pretty

519
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,020
calm here yeah are there good resources for learning V of them but the sounds of

520
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:25,020
it you can't just dive in there are many and if you I've listed them on RWX I

521
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:31,420
haven't been to a whole thing on that RWX slash I want to say tools editor Vim

522
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,580
I don't remember let me go check here

523
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:47,060
let me see here can't find them there we go editors VIM go VIMisms so there's

524
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:55,100
your there's your link well I'll just do this

525
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:02,940
RWX dot gg tools editors and I have a number of things you can use there the

526
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,740
VIM tutor is probably the best even though it's out of date I I would never

527
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:13,140
use anything but the VIM that that is managed by the original creator of VIM

528
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,660
one of the complaints against VIM the reason you know VIM was created is they

529
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,820
the two biggest complaints against it were it was not it was not conducive to

530
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:28,820
community development which I believe is BS and number two that they didn't have

531
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,780
concurrency and that was immediately fixed so if anything good came out of

532
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,340
Neil Vim it was the pressure for for Brom to add that and and he did and I

533
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:42,300
believe something as important as VIM needs to be managed by one person or two

534
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,340
and that's it I've seen committees destroy applications and and I've

535
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,900
actually put my advice about not using Neil Vim out there in fact I could

536
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,580
probably find that for you right now the biggest one is all the things they just

537
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,660
ripped out without even asking anybody there's like a tons of changes that they

538
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,860
made they didn't even ask anybody and but they made it so you can use plugins

539
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,820
with node I mean all the technical and architectural decisions behind Neil Vim

540
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,100
are almost one after the other a testament to horrible technical design

541
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:20,020
and architecture and I just I cannot overstate that I hate it I hate it I just

542
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:26,860
I really hate it it's just really bad hi I can't I'm in the middle of us of an

543
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:36,060
actual educational video but I'll be right there I'll be right there okay so so

544
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:46,220
that's my my complaint against Neil Vim if you want to know and so alright what

545
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:51,580
else we got here a new follower here hey how's it going whatever can I use if I

546
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,860
have to develop on a remote computer like a Linux cloud machine vi the end I

547
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,220
just made a case for that use vi or VIM that's why you should learn it uh-huh and

548
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,340
the way to learn that is use VIM tutor if you want to you can use eventually you

549
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:11,900
can use VIM genius online there's open I think it's open VIM which is another one

550
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,940
then we kind of get you started on that there's a number of them they're all

551
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:20,700
listed on my on the VIM editors H URL that I posted when it comes to graphical

552
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,980
editors I always have no pad plus plus besides the other more powerful ones it

553
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,780
is just the fastest graphical one yeah I agree I mean no pad plus plus is really

554
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:34,260
great it I I still think no pod no pad plus plus I didn't mention at all no pad

555
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:42,740
plus plus fits between no pad and sublime I believe it is really fast but it you

556
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,660
know and it is graphical it's very intuitive because you're just using your

557
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,260
mouse and it's got a little bit of more umph in it besides the plain old no pad

558
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:56,180
particularly it understands utfa you know that that's a thing so so that's you

559
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,100
know you might want to might want to give that one a try to I know people that

560
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,460
still love no pad plus plus and and I use it for a while a long time ago but I'm

561
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,460
I'm pretty much a if I have to use a Windows machine and that would be the

562
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,700
thing but these days Linux is so prevalent on on Windows that I got you

563
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,220
know a Linux terminal at my fingertips I don't I don't need to use any any you

564
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:26,420
know Windows only kind of editor for any reason did I miss the 2020 dumpster yeah

565
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:33,420
it's gone what we'll do that again I'm glad it was a hit which one yeah and so

566
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,660
yeah thanks for the direct the the 2020 dumpster we'll come and do that again I

567
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,340
am gonna wrap up the stream for right now thanks for participating in our

568
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:48,220
little dialogue about this if you have any specific questions that you know you

569
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:53,100
you want to go into ask them in the discord you can ask me directly if I'm

570
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,140
available but but you know we have a whole discord just for this kind of

571
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,020
thing asking questions getting getting in there but I really really felt like I

572
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:10,500
needed to go break this down because for the rest of or Vim Neo Vim and Vim

573
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,780
plug-in will be a support I felt like how you do when you and then came out I'm

574
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,900
seeing more and more and then plugins these days yeah no they stink if you're

575
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,500
first of all okay I'm glad you brought that up if you are searching to use a

576
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:31,820
Vim that allows a lot of plugins if you're picking a Vim editor because of

577
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,420
it uses more plugins or because it's prettier you're picking it for the

578
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,860
wrong reason you might as well just use VS code or a graphic editor at that

579
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,140
point and I strongly believe in that if you're seeking to use to do plugins

580
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,860
instead of integrating shell scripts you're not doing it right in my opinion

581
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:53,020
you're doing it wrong you look if you're gonna reach for a plugin at least

582
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,300
before you reach a plugin learn how to use vi properly if you don't know how

583
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,220
to if you don't know how to use exclamation point and vi and if you

584
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,420
don't know what I'm talking about it's just making my point you don't know how

585
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,220
to use vi on Vim you're not in a position to make a decision about stop

586
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:14,020
using it because it doesn't have plugins and and you need to practice doing the

587
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:19,380
standard way of using Vim integration into the shell before you start punting

588
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,820
and looking for every plugin under the sun and for and picking a tool that will

589
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,900
allow you to plug in to make a plugin in 50 different languages sometimes

590
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,900
specificity is the thing sometimes you don't want 50 options sometimes you

591
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,420
don't want to have a configuration file in 20 different formats sometimes you

592
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,820
want limitations on your types sometimes you want strict typing so all of those

593
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:45,020
architectural principles apply to Vim you don't want too much choice you want

594
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,460
the right choice and that's why Python won over Pearl because it was one best

595
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:54,060
way right so my biggest complaint against Neo Vim is this idea that we

596
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,060
should expand the crap out of it and put whatever we want in and and rip up

597
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,140
rip out stuff that's been there for years and it's not just because I'm an

598
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,340
old guy it's because the entire approach is broken the entire architectural

599
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:10,660
mindset of the Neo Vim team is just totally bored and and I that's

600
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,660
that's my opinion on that I if you disagree that's fine go use it and have

601
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,220
fun there's lots of really respectable awesome people who disagree with me

602
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:24,100
very strongly primegian comes to mind big and bot comes to mind I'm not these

603
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,780
these are great people and great human beings I love them I'm really glad that

604
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,460
I get to be count myself among the streamers with them but there is no way

605
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,420
I will ever be okay with Neo Vim unless I'm presented with new information that

606
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,900
that contradicts what I've just told you what I see them doing is bloating the

607
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,820
crap out of them in ways that are unnecessary and defeat the purpose for

608
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,700
them in the first place the reason that you're picking them in the first place

609
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,620
above all is ubiquity you want to use VI everywhere you might be able to go

610
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,020
here and use it in fact I feel guilty using some of my vimisms but I'm okay

611
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,500
with it and by that argument you can almost say well fine I'm going to use

612
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,100
all the plugins I can I'm going to let myself go crazy as long as I remember

613
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,700
the fundamental navigation elements of VI and stuff so that I'm effective on an

614
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,540
AIX machine or a Solaris machine or anything else that I had to administer

615
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,780
while I was being paid to administer machines and those jobs still exist so

616
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:23,140
my point is that if you know before you give in to the to the tendency to

617
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:29,540
expand and bloat your stuff out for questionable reasons at least consider

618
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:34,100
using what's already there and that includes learning shell integration

619
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,540
when you learn shell integration with the exclamation point I call it VI magic

620
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,500
here go read this

621
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,900
rwxigg vi magic will teach you what I'm talking about the specific thing when

622
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,820
you understand how to use true vi magic then you're in a position to say well

623
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,540
this plugin covers something I don't have I want the groove box thing I want

624
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:03,460
whatever you know I do have plugins I do I use plugins but but I'm very picky

625
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,340
about the plugins because they have to be downloaded on every system I'm going to

626
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,500
use them on you need to make really sure that you're using a plugin manager that

627
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,860
can be turned off or disabled if there's if the if the plugin manager is not on

628
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,940
the system and all of those are things that that are not an option for new of

629
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,740
him if you use a new of him specific configuration you've just blown away your

630
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,660
ability to use that configuration on any remote system by default

631
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,180
you better have a damn good reason to do that if you picked them because you want

632
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:36,420
to be able to use it on multiple systems and I don't think there's ever a decent

633
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:41,620
enough reason for that vim however is everywhere so you can actually port your

634
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:46,980
you can scp in one command your vmrc over to any other system use that edit your

635
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,300
files over there without a problem if you've used neo vmisms in your vmrc and

636
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,980
haven't done it properly you've just blown away your ability to customize any

637
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,140
remote system on the fly because you cannot install neo vm on that cloud

638
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,020
machine without approval from your higher ups that for another change ticket

639
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:09,940
just say no to neo vm i'm telling you say no vim is the is the standard editor

640
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:14,740
for this kind of thing uh and if you do go with neo vm be damn sure you know what

641
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,660
you're doing make sure you know how you use the shell make sure you know that

642
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:24,180
those plugins need to be encapsulated in some vmrc uh code that keeps them from

643
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,180
being unusable on a remote system and if you don't know how if you know anything

644
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,860
about what i just said you have no business using neo vm but the reason i

645
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,380
get so spun up about this is because they hear from somebody on some switch stream

646
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,500
or somewhere that they should just go through that on they end up throwing it

647
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,580
on and they destroy their ability to be to be a performant you know administrator

648
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,620
and developer on a remote system because they somebody told them neo vm was the

649
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,900
thing that they should use i spoke in my piece i think it's probably enough for me

650
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,700
i think the plugins are an interesting aspect of how vim is growing over the years

651
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:02,580
i agree i agree and i'm not and plug is amazing right uh plug is um i mean plug

652
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:08,420
the plug is the plug i i i wish that the native plugins within vim uh were good

653
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:13,140
enough but they're not and the plug plug in manager is amazing it keeps all your

654
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,220
plugins in a separate directory uh if you look at my vmrc by the way i'll send

655
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:23,700
that to you guys if you want to see it uh it's in rwx.gg uh i'm sorry it's uh

656
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:28,900
it's in my git lab so just go to artybex live uh artybex rob.live and click on

657
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,420
github or git lab you can go to my dot files and you can go find my vmrc if you want to

658
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:39,140
spelunk it and by the way it is very common it's a common rite of passage to to steal somebody else's

659
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:44,180
vmrc and and to just use it and understand it but make sure you go through the lines and

660
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,340
get a sense of what it's doing because everybody's is highly customized and it's actually it's kind

661
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,900
of a rite of passage to be a terminal user to do that uh along with you know understanding your

662
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,740
own bash rc uh not to mention a full-time hobby just playing with your configuration i i cannot

663
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:04,740
get enough of of of that i constantly love tweaking my terminal config it's it's really fun i enjoy

664
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:09,460
that more than messing with my operating system uh people ask me all the time well what manager

665
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,140
you're using i have window managers and goes whatever one is going to get me tmux because

666
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,940
i don't care about the window manager i have a pain so there'll be other videos on that i have

667
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,020
already done some videos about it but i'll be redoing them um these videos are all going to be

668
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,180
edited polished and you know scrubbed and put up on vimeo for subscription if you'd like uh

669
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,980
but the raw youtube video that i just made here will will remain standing for as long as youtube

670
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,620
allows it to stay here and i really appreciate you guys coming by and spending some time here

671
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:42,260
and uh i'm going to go ahead and i think we made that through that pretty well didn't we guys we

672
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:50,980
didn't argue too much by i'm going to come back in uh 10 20 minutes and we're going to

673
00:53:50,980 --> 00:54:01,940
do some more web development

674
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:31,940
so
