2020	3720	What are your thoughts on chat, GPT?
5520	7640	So here's the thing.
9720	10560	Why?
12800	14560	That's what I have to say.
14560	19560	Why are people interested in this?
23440	25120	I just don't get it.
25120	26320	I just don't get it.
26320	28240	I have watched all this stuff.
29240	32880	I don't understand what its purpose is.
32880	35040	Personally, I mean, let's go back and read it, okay?
35040	35880	So it says here,
35880	39400	chat GPT is a prototype artificial intelligence chat bot.
39400	40360	Join the club.
40360	41960	I mean, how many other chat bots have we had?
41960	44000	Okay, so maybe this was not going to become
44000	47000	like a masochistic, narcissistic Nazi
47000	48560	like the Twitter bot before.
49760	51100	This is apparently really polite.
51100	52720	I'm sure they trained it to be really, really polite.
52720	54680	Apparently it's really, really polite.
54680	57240	I was scrolling through a thing and it said,
57240	61480	the most polite, clueless bot you'll ever see.
63440	66000	If it's wrong, at least it's wrong politely.
66000	68120	Hopefully it focuses on usability and dialogue.
68120	70280	The chat bot uses a large language model trained
70280	71440	with reinforcement learning
71440	73160	and it's based on GPT 3.5 architecture.
73160	75320	It's also beta, by the way.
75320	76920	It's not final, right?
78800	82080	It's an open prototype,
83080	87920	not finished.
87920	88760	How about that?
88760	90240	So I'll put that there.
90240	91440	Look, if you want to use it, that's fine.
91440	92320	I am not going to judge you.
92320	93680	I just think it's a waste of time.
93680	95840	So many things are a waste of time today.
95840	97760	And to me, that's a waste of time.
97760	98840	Chat bot uses like,
100400	103880	it says here chat GPT was launched in November, 2022
103880	107080	and is garnered attention as its detailed responses
107080	108120	and well-reasoned answers,
108120	110080	although its accuracy has been criticized.
112680	115440	Well-reasoned wrong answers.
115440	120440	And people are like, I mean, there was an entire article
123960	124880	that came across my feed.
124880	129240	It was like, oh, this is the end of essays as we know them.
129240	132400	It's had GPT, GPT going to destroy, you know,
132400	135120	scholastic achievement through essay writing and stuff.
135120	136880	I'm like, no, it's not.
136880	138240	It's not.
138240	139840	It's not.
139840	141280	I mean, it might help you a little bit.
141280	143480	It's like, it's all of these chat bot things,
143480	145160	including the coding one,
145160	147720	all they really are is they're catering to people
147720	150840	who are copy pasta people,
150840	152080	copy pasta people,
152080	156080	the people who don't do any original thinking
156080	159520	who go out and they want to use this thing like,
159520	160360	oh, that's cool.
160360	162600	They don't actually validate that it's true.
162600	166320	Now, if they did, if they did, if they did,
166320	170000	if they did, then it could be a nice suggestion, right?
170000	171240	And I think that's fine.
171240	172880	And it's not just because I'm old that I don't like it.
172880	176480	It's because it's inaccurate
176480	178400	and it's dangerous to trust an AI
178400	181320	that you're not backing up with personal experience.
181320	182440	This is, do I have to, I mean,
182440	185000	how many fictional sci-fies have there been?
186840	188760	This is part of the evolution of AI, right?
188760	190480	I mean, there was a time, there was a time
190480	193120	when if you were to hear a computer-generated voice,
193120	195040	you would go, what the hell did they say?
195040	196360	And now you can't even tell the difference
196360	197600	between computer-generated voices.
197600	199120	So it's going in the right direction.
199120	199960	I don't have any problem with that.
199960	201400	And it needs to go in the right direction.
201400	204600	But right now, why are you wasting time on it?
204600	206800	And there's an unusually large number of people
206800	207840	coming at me with this.
207840	209520	What do you think of Chad GPT?
209520	211560	Who are college students?
213400	215840	And I had one person in here, I'm gonna get them out of me.
215840	218160	I think they're in here right now, actually.
218160	219560	Please don't get mad.
219560	222320	But they said, all I can say is it took
222320	224160	what was otherwise a three-hour assignment
224160	226360	and turned it into 30 minutes.
226360	229640	That's exactly, that's almost word for word what they said.
229640	233280	And I'm thinking to myself, how is that possible?
233280	236600	How is that possible that this thing,
236600	238400	whether, and I don't know the assignment,
238400	240160	I think it was a coding assignment,
240160	245160	that this thing can, oh wow, there's a good one.
245520	247240	I've come up with a set of rules that describe,
247240	251080	ooh, very cool, a code on a tech rail,
251080	252600	ooh, we'll have to go look at that one, Kima.
252600	253600	Yeah, that's very cool.
253600	258040	So the point is, if it was taking you three hours
258040	259560	to do an assignment, whatever it was before,
259560	261640	and it's now taking you 30 minutes
261640	264160	because you have a chatbot that's helping you out,
265240	266520	there's something wrong.
266520	267880	I mean, there's something wrong.
267880	271480	You're either not learning it, not learning it properly,
271480	274800	or, I mean, there's an outside chance
274800	277400	that it's doing the grunt work for you
277400	278960	and that you're still doing the learning
278960	280240	and it's filling in all the blanks
280240	281600	and everything that it would take you longer to type,
281600	284040	especially if you're like a slow typer or something.
284040	286000	And I suppose there's a certain number of people
286000	288320	who are slow typers who can't compose thoughts very easily
288360	290120	and it helps them put the language together
290120	292000	and it's like, yeah, okay, that sounds right.
292000	296440	I, this, my fear with any of these AI things
296440	299560	is just like any other fear is it's like,
299560	302160	they're gonna make us soft.
302160	303760	You know, and that's been something
303760	305880	that old people have been saying, you know,
305880	306920	just the dawn of time.
306920	309200	There were people who didn't wanna get on railroad trains
309200	310680	because they thought it was too fast
310680	311760	and everybody was gonna die.
311760	313080	A lot of people did die, by the way.
313080	316240	And there's actually in Arizona, we opened a geocache there
316240	318560	where there were two trains that were on the same track
318560	321360	and there was, you know, hundreds of hundred people
321360	323920	radically destroyed in an instant
323920	325840	when they're two cranes collided at head.
325840	329080	So there are definitely concerns about these things
329080	331120	as they come out and, you know, should we be doing it?
331120	332680	I was like, yes, we should be definitely trying them out
332680	336360	and experimenting and stuff like that, but to what extent?
336360	341360	I mean, you know, if, honestly, this chat,
342800	343800	I don't know about the coding one.
343800	345440	This is just a chat bot, right?
345440	346960	But the coding one, which is kind of related
346960	349680	in conversation, that one will get you fired
349680	352840	from a company if they find out if they're using it.
352840	354920	Not just because you don't know what you're doing,
354920	358920	but because it's been trained on proprietary source code
358920	363920	that has a indeterminate legal pedigree.
364800	366480	And nobody likes to talk about this.
366480	368280	They all like to talk about how cool, you know,
368280	372360	open AI chat is, I mean, this is a different company, right?
372360	373560	That was the Microsoft thing.
373560	375760	It's the code, whatever, I forget the name of it.
375760	378160	But if you're using that, you're actually taking your career
378160	380160	in your own hands and I wouldn't tell anybody you are.
380160	382000	And I think to a lesser degree,
382000	384400	the chat GPT thing is the same thing.
384400	387320	If you, let's say, for example, let's say for example,
387320	389600	that you save three hours on an essay assignment
389600	394600	by using chat GPT, yeah, they'll work out the legal issues
395720	397760	the tech is too powerful not to use.
397760	400000	I don't think that's true at all.
400000	402520	I must say, I know you're a huge AI fan
402520	405240	and I am not, I am not a fan of it at all.
406680	409760	To me, it's just copy, past, past on steroids.
409760	410600	That's all it is.
410600	413080	And so what it's causing is it's causing a bunch of people
413080	416960	to not learn shit and that's fine.
416960	418920	And this, I mean, I've said it before,
418920	420840	I predicted that everybody should be learning AI
420840	421960	and how to train models properly
421960	425200	because if this is a step in the right direction
425200	427080	where the number of people are gonna be doing
427080	429320	actual programming is gonna go down.
429320	431200	And there's a story I tell about this
431200	433520	that is related to this
433520	435560	because the way that AIs are trained,
435560	437560	including this one that I've been slamming on,
437560	439040	the way that they're trained is organic.
439040	440840	It's closer to how nature does things
440840	442640	than the algorithmic models.
442640	445440	And I have a story about this I wanna tell really quick.
446720	448400	Imagine an AI tutor that can teach kids
448400	449600	in third-world countries.
450680	455680	Wrongly, he'll turn them into white supremacists
456320	458240	even though they're in Africa.
458240	460560	I mean, if it was a Twitter bot, that's what it would do.
460600	461880	Look, we're getting there.
461880	463720	We're getting there, we're just not there, right?
463720	466480	So, that's what I'm saying.
466480	469080	Better than what we have right now, which is nothing.
469080	471560	Well, I mean, it's like there's societal ills
471560	473120	out there to look at.
473120	478040	I'm not anti-AI, I'm just like, I'm like,
478040	479920	so on the one hand, I do think we need to learn
479920	481440	how to train models properly.
481440	484360	I just watched a huge conference.
484360	486680	I almost gave up where I work.
486680	488080	There was this huge, huge conference,
488080	490800	a whole day conference about AI at the place that I work.
491920	493800	And it's crazy, it's crazy.
493800	495920	In fact, the whole future of AI and the focus of it
495920	499160	is not even on writing code, it's on the data.
499160	502200	It's on, and they went through a bunch of examples
502200	504000	of how they were sampling the data
504000	507160	and increasing the data samples so that they were good
507160	509600	because the higher the quality and then put data,
509600	510960	the higher the quality of AI.
510960	512440	And you should see the AI's that haven't,
512440	514280	I wish I could talk about it.
515240	516920	The AI that is going down,
516920	518480	because people may not know,
518480	520640	I support a machine learning group.
520640	523080	I do the SRE and the Kubernetes stuff
523080	525720	and some of the REST API development for,
525720	529160	to support high performance computing machine learning group
529160	531720	and one of the biggest companies in the entire world
533040	536120	who's radically making radical advantage,
536120	538360	taking radical advantage of AI and data.
538360	539800	And it's absolutely amazing.
539800	541160	And they have their own, they're so big,
541160	543800	they have actually, they have their annual conference on it.
543800	545120	And I was just there.
546440	548640	And it's absolutely phenomenally awesome.
548640	550360	So either I'm gonna go camping over the week,
550360	551320	over the Christmas break,
551320	554280	I'm actually gonna start sticking my finger into AI
554280	556760	and learning some of the, doing some Kaggle stuff
556760	558520	and learning, if you're not learning
558520	562200	how to do data science and this kind of thing
562200	564200	and all you're focused on is algorithmic programming
564200	566360	and stuff, I mean, you should see how long it takes me.
566360	568000	Have you seen, I mean, it takes me forever
568000	570520	to just do basic parsing of a string
570520	571520	or something like that.
571520	572920	I mean, I'm relatively fast,
572960	576720	but the amount of time it takes to write code
576720	578200	compared to the amount of time
578200	581240	that it takes organically to train a model
581240	582520	and to get the data in place
582520	586040	and then let that thing write the code is substantial.
586040	587920	And you know, Masi and others here are saying that,
587920	591480	they're like, this is too powerful for it to not take over.
591480	595480	And the chat GPT is not directly related to the coding thing,
595480	596320	but it's the same idea.
596320	597880	The idea is it'll do the thinking for you
597880	599440	and it'll write your essay for you.
599440	602360	And so, I mean, that's, I just,
602360	603400	on the one side it's good,
603400	604680	on the other side it's really bad.
604680	607360	So let me tell you a story about the good stuff, okay?
607360	610000	So there, I would give anything
610000	611080	for the reference to this yet.
611080	615000	I read this in 2014, I think it was.
615000	619320	And I was studying this philosophical difference
619320	623960	between algorithmic approaches to solutions
623960	627000	and natural organic solutions.
627040	630560	And the specific example was,
631840	632760	and I've told the story before,
632760	635360	but the specific example was a cam.
635360	637080	You know what a cam is, right?
637080	639160	It was a cam, like a camshaft in a car,
639160	640720	but it wasn't a car, it was a factory.
640720	645600	It was a factory in New England someplace in the Northeast.
645600	648200	And, you know, back, you know,
648200	649720	where there's a lot of manufacturing going.
649720	653480	And then the story goes that they,
654560	655960	I wish I could find, if anybody can find it,
655960	657480	please give me a reference.
657480	659920	But the device broke down.
659920	662400	And so the production line was down.
662400	664400	And this is a production line that was,
664400	665520	you know, core of the business
665520	667280	and they were losing all this money.
667280	670120	And well, every day it was down, they were losing money.
670120	674880	And this cam, it was this very complicated mechanical process
674880	678120	that had to be done exactly that way,
678120	680520	had been created somewhat organically
680520	682600	and it had been tailored and it had been shaved off
682600	683440	and everything.
683960	685360	And so they had to, you know,
685360	688840	they wanted this very unique cam was the core.
688840	691640	It was the heart of everything on the assembly line
691640	693680	and they couldn't recreate it.
693680	696160	And so they hired, they paid all of this money
696160	700280	to all of these people to do, to fix it.
700280	701440	They brought in theorists,
701440	705080	they brought in the Beth Mathematicians, you know,
705080	707240	and they said, okay, hey, let's, you know,
707240	710440	and they designed lots of failures.
711440	714800	So they would put together all these amazing things
714800	717280	and then they didn't work.
717280	718640	They just didn't work
718640	720400	because they weren't organic enough.
720400	721240	They weren't natural enough.
721240	723880	So then they brought in another team
723880	726800	and I don't remember the specifics of the team,
726800	728880	but this team did the same thing.
728880	730800	They recreated the process that was used
730800	732160	to create the first cam.
732160	735440	And it took them longer to do all the stuff,
735440	736400	but it actually worked.
736400	738960	And what they did is they started with something
738960	743640	that was the best approximation of, you know,
743640	744640	that they could come up with
744640	745840	and they used this stuff from, you know,
745840	748280	the other mathematicians that people had given them
748280	749680	and they put that in there
749680	751080	and then they ran it for a while
751080	752040	and then they would go in
752040	753480	and then they would shave, they had the machinist
753480	754840	and they would shave off part of it
754840	756120	and then they would run it again
756120	757600	and then they would shave off a little bit more
757600	758520	and they would run it again.
758520	760960	And then it was, so it was this fail faster idea, right?
760960	764640	And that idea of adjusting for failure
764640	766800	and training a device,
766800	769000	that's exactly how machine learning works.
769000	770240	So as I understand it.
770240	773240	So having that, you know,
773240	775480	and that got them the solution that they wanted to.
775480	780480	And that process of natural learning that went on,
781320	784280	I mean, natural learning has got a very specific meaning
784280	785480	in the AI world.
785480	788200	And that's, I'm sorry, natural intelligence,
788200	790280	not natural learning, natural intelligence is the goal.
790280	794640	Natural intelligence is when the intelligence is self-aware
794640	796120	and everything and there's a lot of debate
796120	797880	about whether that'll ever be a thing.
797880	802080	But the point of it was that the organic approach,
802080	804520	you know, fail and adjust, fail and fix,
804520	807360	fail and fix, fail and fix is what got them the solution.
807360	809920	And no amount of programming and algorithm
809920	811760	at thinking is in the best minds could get it.
811760	813680	It had to be incrementally done.
813680	815720	And I really appreciate that story
815720	817440	because that's how I do most things.
817440	818840	I'm a very practical guy.
818840	821380	I have a hard time, I mean, I can visualize certain things,
821380	823400	but when it comes to like lead code algorithms
823400	825600	and stuff like that, I don't really do well with them.
825600	829520	But if I can see it working, I can modify what's working
829520	831360	and get it to the point where it's working.
831360	833080	And then if I just look at all the code, I'm like,
833080	834840	okay, I understand how this code's working
834840	836600	because I tweaked it all along the way.
836600	838560	And sometimes there's a refactor along the way
838560	840680	in there too, because, you know, like, hey, you know,
840680	842960	this is not as efficient as it could be.
842960	846360	But, you know, it's avoiding the premature optimization
846360	847920	kind of thing, general intelligence.
847920	850080	Yes, that's what I was looking for.
850080	850920	That's three body problem.
850920	852600	And yeah, that's the one I was looking for.
853080	857560	So, you know, these things are all super fascinating.
857560	859760	Chat, GPT is a part of it.
859760	862680	It's definitely a thing that I think needs to exist.
863800	866160	I just feel like so many people
866160	868440	are like freaking out about it right now.
869680	871280	And I have to ask myself,
871280	873080	isn't there something better you could be doing
873080	874280	with your time?
874280	877720	But that's not my business, do what you want with your time.
877720	879880	I mean, I waste my time plenty good.
879880	883040	So, you know, if you want to play around, then fine.
883040	884120	I don't, I don't.
884120	885840	I have no intention of doing it.
887160	888800	If I could train my own chatbot,
888800	890600	which I am interested in doing,
890600	895680	my goal with AI is to create my,
895680	897200	you know how they say second brain, right?
897200	899600	Second brain is another word for Zettlecasten.
899600	903920	So I have, I've now, I'm up to like 1800 content nodes,
903920	906920	knowledge nodes in my current Zettlecasten.
906920	909200	I have three other knowledge bases
909200	912800	that have over a thousand content nodes in each of them.
912800	915240	And I am in the process of bringing all of those over.
915240	919000	So it's like almost everything that I've ever written about.
919000	921920	And once I get all of that content in one place,
921920	926920	I really want to see how I could put
927280	931320	some machine learning algorithmic stuff,
931320	932360	not machine algorithms,
932360	935200	but I want to see if I could build
935200	939160	some machine learning into my own data stuff, right?
939160	941840	And then, and then of course the extension of this is that,
941840	944400	you know, the exchange grid, the knowledge exchange grid,
944400	947480	once I can get, so let's say, let's say that I have,
947480	949640	I know, text pregeneration, stuff like that, right?
949640	951760	So I'm already doing templates and stuff,
951760	952800	but I mean, it's very possible
952800	953880	that I could do the template generation
953880	955080	automatically through AI.
956640	959800	But something else that's interesting that interests me is that,
959800	961800	is that's just my corpus, right?
961800	963840	I just have my data, my Zettlecasten,
963840	966680	but the goal, and then we're probably like five years out
966680	969480	on this, is to eventually be able to follow multiple other
969480	972440	people and have a cash copy of their Zettlecasten
972440	973520	with me as well.
973520	976360	And, you know, you take that to the nth degree,
976360	978160	if I've got a thousand people,
978160	980520	and there are people that I personally have curated,
980520	982520	my ring of trust about knowledge and that stuff,
982520	985640	now I've created a corpus of data
985640	989760	that's extremely compelling when it comes to not just
989760	992640	searching, but making suggestions.
993560	997440	And then, then we could put,
997440	999000	is that what they call it, chat by utility?
999000	1001600	Yeah, and then I would put on top of that,
1001600	1003880	I would start to layer in the AI,
1003880	1006480	and then I could have the AI suggest things to me,
1006480	1008960	or when I start writing about something,
1008960	1012120	I would love to have another T-Mex window open that's like,
1012120	1013880	dude, you've already talked about this over here,
1013880	1015480	and here, and here, and here, here's the other thing,
1015480	1017040	and have it dynamically see,
1017040	1019640	not just from the keywords that I'm using,
1019640	1021260	which is, you know, a start,
1021260	1023020	but I wanted to see, well, you know,
1023020	1026300	you've written similarly to this,
1026300	1028540	or somebody has written similarly to this,
1028540	1030780	you know, and you see this kind of thing already
1030780	1033980	in like, trouble ticket issues,
1033980	1038860	and stuff like that, that we submit to GitHub,
1038860	1039700	or anything like that, you know,
1039700	1040540	you start typing things like,
1040540	1042460	are you sure it's not this problem right here, right?
1042460	1046580	So there's already, you know, code to do this,
1046580	1048620	and that's kind of the, you know,
1048620	1050260	phase two of the whole keg thing,
1050260	1053100	you know, phase one is to get the knowledge,
1053100	1055100	you know, really stable and collectible,
1055100	1057020	and phase two is kind of exchange it,
1057020	1059220	I guess it's apparently phase three,
1059220	1061220	phase three would be processing the data,
1061220	1064020	that would be processing all the knowledge,
1064020	1065620	it's not going to fall about it.
1067140	1070420	They did it for the reason of spam, yeah, I mean, yeah,
1070420	1072700	I just would never want to put it,
1072700	1074700	I mean, it's bad enough having a chat bot, you know,
1074700	1076980	do one thing, the hardest part about all of this
1076980	1079780	is going to be being able to determine who's real,
1079780	1083180	and that's already becoming a thing, right?
1083180	1086260	I mean, I imagine there's a lot of like, you know,
1086260	1088620	porn and cheating sites that are going to love these,
1088620	1092140	these AIs, because they're just going to be
1092140	1094900	the best, you know, pretend girls ever,
1094900	1099100	yeah, NPCs will be awesome, yeah,
1099100	1101660	has apps now that check for secrets,
1101660	1104260	check for dependency security flaws, yeah, yeah.
1105380	1106660	Yeah, and there's like, there's chat,
1106660	1111060	yeah, I mean, all of those sorts of things are stuff
1111060	1112180	that I definitely want to add in.
1112180	1114140	So I'm not, it's not that I'm against chat bots,
1114140	1115740	I'm definitely adding a chat bot,
1115740	1118260	I've already started adding a Twitch chat bot,
1118260	1122620	which what I want it to do is like, you know,
1122620	1124500	I have all these commands, right?
1124500	1126260	But I hate maintaining the commands,
1126260	1129140	so what I would rather have my chat bot do,
1129140	1131540	my Twitch chat bot, what I would rather have it do
1131540	1135060	is I would rather have it become intimately familiar
1135060	1137380	with my Zettelkasten, right?
1137380	1141860	So if somebody starts chatting about something,
1141860	1143940	and Masi's already made some really amazing stuff
1143940	1146380	on this level, if somebody starts chatting about something,
1146380	1150260	I want my chat bot to score potentially a response
1150260	1152140	and say, okay, somebody's talking like this,
1152140	1154540	somebody used a question mark, somebody's doing whatever.
1154540	1157660	And he'll say, if you're asking about this,
1157660	1159580	this is what I was trying to do, right?
1159580	1161900	So I would really love to be able to create
1161900	1165660	kind of a proactive customer service-like bot in my Twitch
1165660	1167780	that answers all of the mundane questions for me
1167780	1170260	without people having to go to the commands, right?
1170260	1171460	I mean, they go to the commands
1171460	1172660	and then they have to filter through the commands
1172660	1173780	and they have to find the right one,
1173780	1176300	and sometimes they do and there's kind of a path through there,
1176300	1177700	but I have to maintain all of that.
1177700	1180380	And maintaining the commands, I actually was looking at it,
1180380	1182620	I've got like 200, 300 commands.
1182620	1185380	Yeah, if I train it on my Zett as my corp,
1185380	1188540	yeah, then I would be, so then somebody asks a question
1188540	1191820	and all I have to do is write.
1192100	1195260	I don't have to go in and create all the interlinking
1195260	1197980	and stuff like that inside of a specific,
1197980	1199060	commands database.
1199060	1201020	I just maintain my Zodacast and answer questions
1201020	1201980	just like I'm doing right now,
1201980	1204900	and then I include links to YouTube and stuff like that.
1204900	1206780	And the links are identifiable
1206780	1208540	because they've got the YouTube emoji on them.
1208540	1211100	So my chat bot could be intelligent and say,
1211100	1213540	hey, well, there's actually these YouTube videos on this too.
1213540	1218020	And it could proactively engage with anybody in my chat
1218020	1219940	while I'm writing and doing the work.
1219940	1222980	And then I, I mean, it might not be as personal,
1222980	1225460	but it could be very valuable.
1225460	1228860	I think that personal broadcasting,
1228860	1230900	as we do it now on this coworking kind of thing,
1230900	1232100	is going to progress.
1232100	1234980	I think, yeah, take care.
1234980	1237340	It's, I think that this is one of those things
1237340	1240420	that is going to progress
1240420	1241700	and it's gonna become more valuable.
1241700	1244660	Right now it's just kind of a fascination.
1245660	1250660	But the day that I can point a chat GPT at my Zodacast
1251540	1254340	and have it automatically train itself
1254340	1258140	and get 90% accuracy on when to participate in my chat
1258140	1261500	and about answering questions on my behalf as an AI,
1261500	1265540	that's the time when I will become extremely interested in it.
1265540	1267260	I will become extremely interested in it
1267260	1268780	because then it's saving me time.
1268780	1271020	That's what AI potentially could do.
1271020	1274060	And, you know, somebody mentioned the teaching thing.
1274260	1276260	I think there's another,
1276260	1281260	I understand chat GPT is a subset of instructional GPT.
1281300	1282660	Did you guys read about that?
1282660	1283740	So there's another GPT.
1283740	1286620	It's like, I think it's called instruction GPT.
1286620	1290180	It's actually designed for training and teaching
1290180	1292020	and stuff like that, more than just a random chat one.
1292020	1293740	The random chat one is to get, you know,
1293740	1295180	people's interest and stuff.
1295180	1297740	So that actually does, does, is interesting to me.
1297740	1300060	I think teaching is fine.
1301060	1306060	I think that there, yeah,
1307260	1309060	if there was some way to have it correct.
1309060	1311620	So that's kind of, I mean, the thing of it,
1311620	1312780	mostly that would be really cool
1312780	1314860	is if you had a bot that was running, right?
1314860	1316140	So if you had a bot that was running,
1316140	1318740	it was trained off of your corpus and Zodacast then,
1318740	1320500	it could chime in every once in a while
1320500	1322220	and maybe it would get things wrong.
1322220	1324460	It would say, well, that's not really the right answer there.
1324460	1325740	Here's the right answer.
1325740	1328900	And then it could take its correction,
1328900	1330980	add it to its algorithm and say,
1330980	1333060	so that whole thing that you have to do with AI,
1333060	1334420	where you have to constantly correct it
1334420	1335580	when it gets stuff wrong, right?
1335580	1337100	But it learns.
1337100	1338940	Every time it gets something wrong in a chat,
1338940	1340820	we could laugh about it and I could correct it
1340820	1343220	and then it would get that answer right next time.
1343220	1346420	And then we could just keep going like that,
1346420	1347260	you know what I mean?
1347260	1348860	And it could try really hard
1348860	1351180	and I could just kind of train it
1351180	1353860	along with everybody else while I'm not here.
1353860	1358860	So the idea of setting up like a SkiZix,
1358940	1360540	so I used to name my bot,
1360540	1364380	an interactive bot that dynamically learns
1364380	1366980	by attempting to answer popular, frequent,
1366980	1368220	unasked questions and getting them wrong
1368220	1369340	and having it be corrected,
1369340	1372660	that's like crazy, crazy compelling for me.
1372660	1374340	And that's just from a customer service perspective,
1374340	1375980	but from an educational perspective and all that.
1375980	1380060	Now, if you're gonna start asking my bot about everything
1380060	1382140	and putting that in your essay,
1383780	1385300	I don't know how I feel about that.
1385300	1387740	Maybe it's just making searching efficient.
1387740	1388880	I mean, I say that all the time.
1388880	1390200	I say if you wanna be in good in tech,
1390200	1391480	you gotta be a really good researcher,
1391480	1392400	be able to search fast.
1392400	1395880	Well, if you have a bot that's doing all the searching
1395880	1397880	for you all the time and you're just asking your bot
1397880	1400720	about that's more likely to get the right answer,
1400720	1405720	then, you know, as it takes four gigabytes of GP RAM
1406040	1408100	to train these modern models, really.
1410040	1412460	Yeah, well, there's a lot of them, yeah.
1413800	1414640	Yeah, I don't know.
1414640	1417440	It'd be interesting to see how much I could do.
1417440	1419240	I mean, I do have my thing over here.
1419240	1422240	So, I'm trying to figure out how much I could actually do
1422240	1425360	that, it'd have to have a lot of data too, right?
1425360	1426200	So,
1429520	1434520	oh no, no, that would not be a thing to get, yes.
1436320	1438280	So, that's my opinion on it.
1439440	1441120	Yeah, I'm kind of underwhelmed with it,
1441120	1442760	but I know that it's going in the right direction.
1442760	1443840	I guess I'm kind of annoyed
1443840	1446360	because everybody's asking me about it.
1446360	1448800	And I'm like, well, what are you using it for?
1448800	1451520	And every time I ask what they're using it for,
1452640	1454760	it's, well, it's making me do my homework faster.
1454760	1457840	And I'm like, oh my God, it's like,
1457840	1459160	but I don't know if that's bad.
1459160	1460520	I think it's bad.
1460520	1461760	I think it's bad because people are not doing
1461760	1463240	their own research.
1463240	1464440	It's one of two things.
1464440	1465960	They're either not doing their own research
1465960	1468960	or it's facilitating their research, right?
1468960	1473320	If it's the second, then I'm all for that.
1473320	1474920	I mean, the terminal makes you faster
1474920	1477160	during your own research, so why not an AI?
1478600	1483440	So, you know, if you shut learning, yeah.
1484840	1487880	So, I think that's it.
1487880	1492680	I mean, I don't have any inclination to play with it.
1492680	1493920	I got too many other things to make right now,
1493920	1498920	but as I said, if it were gonna make my Twitch bot
1499040	1501400	more intelligent so that it could help people
1501400	1504600	learn more quickly and save me some time,
1504600	1506480	then that's a good thing.
1506480	1507320	That's a good thing.
1507320	1509720	So, I'll try to keep my thoughts open on that,
1509720	1512680	but Project Matters and Ceaseless are on board.
1512680	1513720	It will replace jobs.
1513720	1516320	Then I'm fine with it, use it as an education.
1516320	1518880	They can't have it, just won't want it.
1518880	1521880	Why would they have it replace jobs?
1521880	1523200	I don't understand that statement at all.
1523200	1524400	I've heard that before.
1525720	1528620	This chat bot is no word near replacing anyone.
1529880	1534380	I mean, even the people who operated the front desk
1534860	1537380	like the place that took my piss for my drug test.
1539740	1544740	Even they are not replaceable yet by this.
1545140	1549340	I mean, I just, I don't see it being that reliable.
1549340	1551200	And they were pretty damn bad.
1554100	1556140	I don't even want to talk about it.
1556140	1558420	Oh, I'm sorry, as you're here at 3.58,
1558420	1560380	at 12.58 and not one o'clock,
1560380	1562660	you need to wait until one o'clock.
1562660	1563500	Really?
1563620	1564460	I just don't even want to.
1564460	1566060	It's a different thing completely.
1566060	1568220	I just had to go through.
1568220	1571140	I had to wait in line for like two hours
1571140	1572140	to get a drug test.
1572140	1572980	My phone died.
1572980	1574100	I had to come back the next day
1574100	1575860	and wait again for two hours.
1578140	1581020	See, any of those things that could be improved by AI,
1581020	1582180	I'm down.
1582180	1583020	I'm down.
1584300	1587380	I'm down with those things being approved.
1587380	1588820	Corporations are going to use it eventually
1588820	1590540	and people should use it as well as benefit them.
1590540	1591780	Yeah, for sure.
1591780	1592780	Teachers are next.
1593780	1595740	At least the current way of teaching.
1595740	1597820	Well, I think the current way of teaching is totally broken.
1597820	1600580	So I am all about having...
1602620	1607620	I am all about the education getting disrupted by AI.
1608100	1611060	And it's not completely untrue that the way
1611060	1613580	that education is happening now could be taken over
1613580	1615700	by an AI, absolutely.
1615700	1616740	Absolutely.
1616740	1621300	It's like, okay, I'm gonna tell you about a topic in general
1621300	1622980	and I'm gonna sit here and blah, blah, blah.
1622980	1624900	And you're gonna take notes and there's no ability
1624900	1627380	for us to interact except for off hours.
1627380	1631300	And then you get like an hour possibly with a TA.
1631300	1634620	You know, the entire model for modern education
1634620	1636260	is totally broken.
1636260	1637780	It's totally broken.
1637780	1641700	And it could easily be replaced by AI.
1641700	1643380	I completely agree with that.
1644540	1647340	But if you take the true learning model,
1647340	1649420	the Art of Ex thing that we talked about,
1649420	1652420	then where you're failing faster and you're being organic
1652460	1656540	and you have a one-on-one mentor who knows you personally,
1656540	1657780	I think we're a ways from that.
1657780	1660260	I do think that AI could get there.
1660260	1664860	I think that AI could have a strong chance
1664860	1668140	at learning about you and learning about your interests
1668140	1670220	and learning about what you struggle with and learning.
1670220	1674140	I think those things for education could be really cool.
1674140	1675380	I mean, think about that.
1675380	1679540	That you could have an AI that becomes trained
1679540	1681980	on your regular failures.
1681980	1684780	So maybe you're learning a foreign language
1684780	1688060	and you get imperative declension wrong in Russian
1688060	1689220	all the time.
1689220	1691860	It's like the thing, it's constantly doing the assessments
1691860	1693900	and everything that a teacher would be doing
1693900	1696300	and then never doing anything, just giving you an F, right?
1696300	1698060	It would be adapting and saying,
1698060	1700340	hey, okay, I know you have trouble with this one thing,
1700340	1701940	so I'm gonna give you more of these things.
1701940	1706140	So the potential to have AI adapt to our weaknesses
1706140	1707180	as we're learning,
1707180	1708500	maybe we don't remember things very well.
1708500	1710060	That would be me, right?
1710060	1712900	So it would be more about repetition.
1712900	1715100	I think that there's a tremendous potential there
1715100	1716500	for that, I really do.
1717580	1719180	Intermediate with video graphics, not just text.
1719180	1720140	So whole learning path,
1720140	1721580	focus on the way of learning with custom graphics
1721580	1722740	to explain, yeah.
1722740	1723700	Well, and that's another thing too.
1723700	1725060	I mean, there's a book out there
1725060	1726220	called Multiple Intelligences
1726220	1729500	and it talks about all the different ways that we learn.
1729500	1731980	Thomas, what's his name, Sir Ken.
1731980	1733140	Sir Ken talks about this.
1733140	1736260	The woman who created the Juilliard Academy failed.
1736260	1738380	She failed out of all her classes
1738380	1739620	and they took her to a specialist
1739660	1741020	and she was moving around
1741020	1744340	and the specialist said to the parents, look at her.
1744340	1745260	And she goes, what?
1745260	1747220	And he goes, she has to be moving.
1747220	1748580	They got her in a special school
1748580	1750740	that was dynamic for dynamic learners
1750740	1753180	who were walking around, had to be moving to learning.
1753180	1754300	And she excelled.
1754300	1756620	She excelled so much, she made the most,
1756620	1757980	she made Juilliard Academy out of it.
1757980	1760700	If they had written her off because of her learning style,
1760700	1765100	and that is one way that AI can adapt.
1765100	1766380	I mean, everybody knows a teacher,
1766380	1767460	the best teachers in the world
1767460	1769460	are the ones who are able to adapt to the individual peak.
1769460	1771220	Students, right?
1771220	1773740	And there's tons and tons of horrible teachers
1773740	1775140	who don't adapt at all.
1775140	1778220	They stay in their methods, they do their thing.
1778220	1781100	It's like you adapt to them or you die and get an F
1781100	1782300	and you have to take it over again
1782300	1783260	and spend all the money.
1783260	1784860	There's plenty of that.
1784860	1788660	But if you, so the good teachers who adapt
1788660	1792460	and make things engaging and change their methods
1792460	1796460	or allow God forbid one student to do one project
1796460	1797780	that's different than another student
1797780	1799980	because of the way that they learn.
1799980	1804980	I mean, how do you set up a rubric for that?
1807940	1809140	You can't.
1809140	1812420	But if you have an AI, maybe an AI kind of thing
1812420	1816060	is gonna get us into this closer to one-on-one education,
1816060	1818220	which is the holy grail.
1818220	1820580	One-on-one education has been the way humans
1820580	1823960	have been learning best since the dawn of time.
1823960	1826260	There's overwhelming evidence of this,
1826260	1828820	but nobody accepts that evidence
1828820	1832600	because it's too impractical to do.
1832600	1834300	At least they say, I don't think it is.
1834300	1836180	I think that if they were to actually economically,
1836180	1838580	I think they can make it work, but they don't.
1838580	1839700	And in order to make it work,
1839700	1843020	you'd have to have mentors adapted to a different,
1843020	1845300	I mean, when you had back in the old days,
1845300	1847580	it was like one-on-one and if that pairing didn't work,
1847580	1849540	you would find a different guru or a different master
1849540	1850380	and you would go to that person.
1850380	1853020	You would go to one person for their mastery in this thing
1853020	1854300	and another person in a mastery in this thing.
1854300	1856180	That's true education.
1856180	1859780	And that's not happening in the traditional system,
1859780	1861380	but AI could potentially do it.
1861380	1863900	AI could potentially do it, it could.
1863900	1866300	Yeah, reviews on game writers versus 10 years ago.
1866300	1868900	Oh yeah, yes.
1868900	1873780	Yeah, based on consensus.
1873780	1875220	Well, I think one of the things
1875220	1878500	that individual instruction like that is going to get both.
1878500	1883500	This is something interesting about what I want to say here.
1886380	1887700	Homeschooling.
1887700	1889700	So that's, okay, so I live in the South, right?
1889700	1891340	I live in North Carolina.
1891340	1895860	And ironically, there's extreme agreement
1897500	1901940	between very, very right-wing conservatives
1901940	1905340	and very, very leftist progressives
1907020	1909020	on this topic of homeschooling.
1910500	1912220	Now, I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,
1912260	1915700	but they agree that the current system
1915700	1917620	does not meet their needs.
1917620	1918860	Now, the one people agree
1918860	1920540	because they don't think mathematics
1920540	1921740	and science are a priority
1921740	1924420	and that faith in Jesus is all that matters.
1924420	1926060	I was told that to my face
1926060	1929300	when my son was denied access to such a school
1929300	1931660	because he didn't have enough belief in Jesus
1931660	1934220	according to their method, because we were Mormon.
1934220	1935460	That's a true story.
1937820	1940260	But they had, we thought more direct instruction
1940260	1942540	would be better, but it turns out, no.
1942540	1944820	They literally told us math and sciences
1944820	1946820	are secondary to faith in Jesus.
1946820	1950820	And we're like, okay, we'll be moving on now.
1950820	1952620	And then you have the other people
1952620	1955420	who are all about the mass and the sciences
1955420	1958020	and playing in mud and stuff like that
1958020	1959620	in kind of the hippie education.
1959620	1961100	And believe it or not,
1963980	1967260	so believe it or not, those two camps
1967260	1968660	both want the same thing.
1968660	1972180	They want the government to get out of the way
1972180	1974180	when it comes to education
1974180	1976060	because they believe that education
1976060	1977180	can't be done properly
1977180	1982180	through any kind of singularly interested association
1982500	1985460	and all the problems that are coming up in education
1985460	1987420	are all related to this thing.
1987420	1990700	I just don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing
1990700	1994020	to let people even get more in their sandbox.
1994020	1996660	I mean, I think, I don't know.
1996660	1998860	I don't know, it's a really divisive topic.
2000660	2003100	Interested both South Carolina power stations
2003100	2003940	have been talking this week.
2003940	2005100	Oh, I know.
2005100	2006740	I know, I was here.
2006740	2008360	Dude, I saw it.
2008360	2010380	I don't want to talk about it right now.
2010380	2012260	We can talk about that at a different time.
2012260	2015980	No, they confirmed it was an act of terrorism in our state.
2015980	2017200	So we're Ireland now.
2018820	2020640	Yeah, it's in my state.
2020640	2023520	I'm seeing it on the news all the time.
2023520	2024960	It's not even far away.
2025960	2028200	Yeah, so we are Ireland.
2028200	2029720	America is officially Ireland.
2030680	2035680	We're getting attacked by domestic terrorists.
2036040	2038240	They took out our power grid for two days.
2039120	2042360	Yep, let's talk about that another time.
2042360	2044360	I don't know if AI is gonna help with that.
