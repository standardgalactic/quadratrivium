0	6500	Should you go to college? Whether you are young or old, the decision to go to college is a huge one.
6500	10000	I already did a video on whether you should go to college or not.
10000	16000	The answer is probably yes, particularly in America, and in Europe it's free, right?
16000	19000	But in America you have to weigh the cost benefit and all of that.
19000	28000	But there's really five reasons to go to college, and the truth is if you can accomplish those things,
28000	31000	if you can do those things that you get from college in other ways,
31000	34000	and I'm going to share a couple stories of people who have done this,
34000	38000	then I don't think college is as required, and I'm not the only one saying that.
38000	42000	There are a lot of people who are not just old people, but young people who are now saying,
42000	47000	I don't need to go into massive debt in order to accomplish those five things.
47000	51000	So what are those five things? We are going to do H&L, CSS, yes.
51000	53000	So what are the five things?
53000	60000	The first thing is obviously people go to college to get a job.
60000	65000	Now that doesn't necessarily, that's not usually the first reason to go to college that people go.
65000	70000	They don't even think of that, and usually they'll pick a major like psychology,
70000	74000	which I actually helped someone actually get a job after they got a major in psychology
74000	76000	because they couldn't get work.
76000	79000	I'm not bagging on psychologists, I'm just saying that if you want a job,
79000	81000	you've got to get a degree that's going to get you a job.
81000	84000	I have a Russian degree, I actually had a job in Russia,
84000	87000	but my wife told me she didn't want to be in Russia anymore,
87000	93000	so I had to re-skill, and I had to use a bunch of the things that I learned on my own in the computer lab
93000	98000	as a linguist in the computer lab and also by building out my own home lab
98000	101000	without going to college at all and continuing to go to college.
101000	104000	So the number one reason is to get a job.
104000	109000	Now you can definitely qualify, you can learn the skills to get a job without going to college.
109000	112000	I made a whole video about why computer science might not be the right choice for you.
112000	115000	Computer science is definitely the right choice for certain professions,
115000	117000	but not the ones you think.
117000	120000	If you want to work for a Silicon Valley or any company that's doing tech things
120000	122000	that's going to pay you a tech salary,
122000	125000	you're probably not going to want a computer science degree, honestly.
125000	129000	You're probably going to want the skills that you would get
129000	132000	shooting to get a certification like a Red Hat certification,
132000	138000	or one of these is there's another video of me drinking while talking about the Red Hat certification
138000	143000	because I really hate that the system and ComTA and all the certs that are out there
143000	146000	that you can get to supplement your college.
146000	148000	Some of them are cheaper than that.
148000	150000	They're also not necessary to get a job.
150000	154000	And so another story, some time ago, I believe it was in 2013,
154000	161000	IBM made a very public statement about that they don't require anybody to have a college degree.
161000	164000	And they made a big deal of it and they showcased a few people,
164000	170000	one of whom got a security job for IBM at 18 without having anything.
170000	173000	They had a lot of knowledge.
173000	176000	I think that person may have actually had a security certificate of some kind,
176000	180000	but the point that IBM was making and many other big companies did around 2013, 2014,
180000	183000	that was a long time ago, was that you didn't need college.
183000	190000	And there's been overwhelming evidence that you still need to go to college to get a job,
190000	192000	which brings us to the second point.
192000	197000	So IBM created a system called K-16, which was this educational system
197000	201000	that took you all the way through the first couple years of college,
201000	203000	and then you just would go through that and then you would,
203000	205000	and I don't even know where that landed.
205000	207000	I don't know if there's a million.
207000	210000	But the second main reason to go to college is to get a job.
210000	213000	I mean, it's to actually make more money at your job,
213000	216000	and that is statistically borne out by the science.
216000	219000	I'm going to refer to Adam Ruins College.
219000	221000	Please go watch the video about this.
221000	224000	It talks about, yes, at every stage in their careers,
224000	227000	people that went to college made 30% more in America,
227000	233000	and generally enjoyed better opportunities because they went to college.
233000	235000	I hate reporting that statistic.
235000	237000	I hate it because it shouldn't make any difference.
237000	242000	If you have the skill, you should be paid for that skill, the end.
242000	244000	And so that's the second reason, to make more money,
244000	246000	to get a job and to make more money.
246000	249000	Those are not the first two reasons that people cite to go to college.
249000	251000	Most of them, they cite it while they want the third one,
251000	254000	which is to find yourself, to discover what it is you want to be,
254000	261000	to smell the roses and figure out what it means to be a thinker,
261000	265000	to take philosophy classes, to get high or get drunk
265000	268000	and figure things out or to write poetry or to do whatever.
268000	272000	People use college as an opportunity of self-discovery,
272000	275000	and it's very expensive to do that.
275000	281000	To go to college, to pay $3,000 or $4,000 a semester to find yourself,
281000	284000	it's an extremely expensive way to do that.
284000	285000	Take a gap year.
285000	288000	In fact, some colleges that are more responsible than others
288000	290000	have gone so far as to say,
290000	294000	you can take a gap year and we will pay you a scholarship
294000	297000	for you to take a gap year before college even starts.
297000	300000	So you can figure it out what you want to be, who you are,
300000	302000	what you believe.
302000	306000	There's a huge debate in the larger culture world
306000	310000	about the value of a college education, particularly now in 2024
310000	316000	when there's all kinds of radical things happening on college campuses
316000	320000	because college campuses have traditionally been the places where progress happens.
320000	322000	That's where people are testing the boundaries.
322000	324000	They're testing interpersonal boundaries,
324000	326000	they're testing their societal boundaries,
326000	327000	and they're discovering things.
327000	331000	Some people would cite that that's the number one reason to go to college,
331000	333000	and that's why we have to have colleges.
333000	337000	We have to have places where people can go and think and not care.
337000	339000	Not care about the bill that they're going to get
339000	341000	or the fact that they might lose their job.
341000	344000	Tenured professorships is one of the worst things that ever happened in the world
344000	347000	because these people don't have to worry about accountability at all
347000	349000	because they have a job no matter what.
349000	351000	When is that ever a good idea?
351000	353000	I don't think that's a good idea.
353000	356000	So finding yourself, who you want to be,
356000	359000	what is your career going to be, what are you going to do with your life,
359000	361000	that is the third reason.
361000	363000	That's usually one of the main reasons that people go.
363000	366000	Along with that, who are you going to meet along the way?
366000	371000	This includes your potential life partner, particularly Mormon.
371000	373000	If you're a Mormon, there was a joke, a running joke saying,
373000	375000	if you're a Mormon, you're going to go to college
375000	378000	because that's where you're going to meet your spouse.
378000	382000	So women who are not encouraged to get education,
382000	385000	they would go there to find a husband, they'd find their husband,
385000	388000	they'd drop out of school, and then they'd go back later in life.
388000	391000	It's absolutely abysmally bad, it's a horrible thing.
391000	394000	Because education for women is kind of downplayed,
394000	396000	they've since kind of come around on that,
396000	398000	but the point is connections.
398000	401000	You're going to college to create connections.
401000	404000	Some of those connections are going to be lifelong friendships.
404000	407000	Some of them are going to be potential job opportunities.
407000	409000	I mean professors, right?
409000	412000	Some of the friendships that I have made with professors
412000	416000	while I was in college have gone on to be some of the most valuable things
416000	421000	in my entire life, and I cannot say it any other way.
421000	425000	Some of the people that I met in college, the same sort of thing.
425000	427000	Of course I met my wife in college.
427000	429000	So the people that you meet in college are going to be
429000	432000	some of the most important people you're ever going to meet.
432000	436000	Again, it's a very expensive way to meet people.
436000	438000	And I'm going to come back to that point
438000	441000	by telling some stories about alternative ways to do these different things.
441000	446000	And the fifth thing is to learn how to do your laundry.
446000	451000	To put it bluntly, you've got to learn how to adult.
451000	453000	You've got to be a grown-up.
453000	455000	You've got to take care of your laundry,
455000	458000	whether you decide to live in your car or an apartment or whatever.
458000	460000	You've got to learn to do your dishes,
460000	463000	whether it's you only have one fork, one knife, and one spoon
463000	466000	so that you never have dishes piled up like I had to do because
466000	468000	otherwise nobody would ever do the dishes.
468000	471000	You've got to learn to get along with people that you're roommates with.
471000	473000	You have to be a grown-up.
473000	475000	You have to learn how to manage your life.
475000	476000	You've got to do your finances.
476000	479000	You have to understand what it means to buy something,
479000	481000	to buy your first computer on credit
481000	483000	so that you can build your credit in America,
483000	486000	so that you can survive in America because you have to have credit.
486000	488000	There's a professor, a good friend of ours,
488000	490000	who went her whole life without buying anything on credit
490000	492000	and she can't do anything.
492000	493000	She almost couldn't get a mortgage
493000	496000	because she was so responsible with her money the whole time
496000	498000	because she's not playing by the capitalist system.
498000	501000	I don't care if you like it or not.
501000	502000	I hate it.
502000	503000	That's just the rules of the rules of the game.
503000	505000	So knowing the rules is half the battle.
505000	509000	So let's talk about some alternatives to doing those five things.
509000	514000	So to conclude primarily before we go out to the next part,
514000	517000	it's really important that you say to yourself,
517000	524000	okay, college has become the most convenient for many people,
524000	529000	albeit expensive, college is the most convenient way
529000	532000	to do all five of those things.
532000	535000	They've got a dorm set up for you to help you learn how to adults.
535000	538000	They've got resident assistants to help you know
538000	540000	where to go get your vaccinations when you need it.
540000	542000	They've got all kinds of weird things.
542000	545000	College campuses, since the dawn of time,
545000	548000	since the dawn of college campuses,
548000	552000	have been set up to meet the needs of those five things.
552000	554000	And it's extremely convenient for most people.
554000	558000	It's also very, very expensive.
558000	563000	But why would knowing about those five things on their own be relevant?
563000	565000	Okay, so let's give you a couple of examples.
565000	568000	One of them is getting the skills to get a job
568000	570000	and getting more money to get a job,
570000	573000	getting the credentials that are going to get you money to get the job,
573000	575000	and maybe meeting people that would get you a job, right?
575000	577000	Let's talk about those three things.
577000	578000	There's other videos on this,
578000	582000	but let's say I'll do another video on online universities, right?
582000	585000	But when you talk about a college experience,
585000	588000	the general college experience, I went to football games,
588000	592000	I had all the thing, is that, you know,
592000	594000	it's the opposite of an online degree.
594000	598000	If you go get an online degree from an accredited institution like WGU,
598000	600000	and there's a separate video on that,
600000	605000	then you are not having many of those five experiences, right?
605000	607000	But you're spending a lot less money.
607000	610000	So one of the ways to do the first three,
610000	614000	to make more money and get a skilled job skills,
614000	615000	and me people are going to get you a job,
615000	617000	is to go to an online university,
617000	619000	which is way, way, way cheaper,
619000	623000	or focus on getting credentials or doing whatever else it takes
623000	625000	to establish trust that you can do the job.
625000	626000	Those are things you can do on your own.
626000	628000	If you took the cost, this is a true story.
628000	633000	So my son went to a community college,
633000	635000	computer science 101 course,
635000	638000	and there's 85 people in the room or something,
638000	640000	and they asked him to raise his hand,
640000	643000	and they said, does anybody here have any programming experience?
643000	644000	And he raised his hand,
644000	647000	because he had already completely learned how to code in Python and Go.
647000	651000	He'd made several applications in Go on the back end,
651000	653000	and in actually JavaScript as well.
653000	654000	So, I mean, he knew how to code.
654000	659000	He had proven, he had built online interactive WebSockets based games
659000	663000	with all of the components of programming in that realm.
663000	665000	So he had a lot of, I mean, the fundamentals of programming
665000	668000	that were taught in CS101, he had a lot of them.
668000	670000	And then he proceeded to raise his hand.
670000	672000	He was the only kid in the class who raised his hand.
672000	674000	He went up and talked to his professor at the end
674000	677000	and said, is there any way I can test out of this class?
677000	679000	And they said, no, I'm sorry.
679000	685000	So he paid $2,000 for a course that covered material he already had.
685000	687000	I have another story about this.
687000	689000	Gabe, if Gabe out there,
689000	692000	Gabe taught himself assembly when he was 16.
692000	697000	He ordered his own circuit boards that arrived via DHL from China
697000	701000	that he designed on SOLIDWORKS himself while he was with me,
701000	703000	while he was doing beginner booth stuff.
703000	705000	He literally had his pick of colleges,
705000	706000	and when he went to his first college,
706000	710000	he had to take CS, whatever, to teach computer engineering,
710000	713000	and he ended up teaching the assembly class.
713000	721000	He paid $2,000 for the privilege of being the unpaid TA for that course.
721000	724000	And then he immediately became the TA.
724000	728000	He applied to be the TA, and he became the TA next.
728000	731000	He became the TA for the course, and now he's teaching all the play.
731000	732000	He was in the class. He knew everything.
732000	735000	He knew everything in the course, and he was totally frustrated,
735000	736000	but he's like, whatever.
736000	740000	He paid all this money because the system wasn't set up to let him say,
740000	743000	oh, I already know this, right?
743000	746000	So there's a couple of takeaways from that.
746000	751000	The first one is, you can learn any skill that's taught in college.
751000	753000	You can learn any skill that will get you.
753000	755000	In fact, some skills that they won't teach in college, many.
755000	760000	MIT very famously has a thing called the Lost Semester,
760000	763000	where they teach you how to use desktop Linux, among other things,
763000	766000	because it's not included as a part of the curriculum,
766000	768000	because it's not serious enough.
768000	770000	It's totally stupid.
770000	773000	And the point is, is that you can learn those skills other ways.
773000	776000	You can make more relationships with other people in other ways,
776000	778000	and you can do it for on the cheap way better.
778000	781000	So WGU is another one of these universities where you can learn all those things.
781000	784000	Now WGU is going to leave you hanging on the other two things.
784000	787000	You're not going to meet as many people through WGU bottom line.
787000	788000	It's not happening.
788000	789000	It's not going to be as society.
789000	793000	You're probably not going to meet your spouse at WGU, right?
793000	796000	You might make a business contact or two, but probably not.
796000	798000	So that means you're going to need to actively go out to meetups
798000	801000	and do the things that you have to do throughout your career.
801000	804000	Anyway, might as well get started before college.
804000	806000	In fact, one of the biggest complaints I have about college
806000	809000	is that because it so conveniently covers all five of those things,
809000	814000	when people leave college, they don't know how to do those things outside of college.
814000	818000	But if you focus on preparing relationships at local meetups,
818000	820000	knowing what conferences to go to,
820000	822000	knowing who to hang out with,
822000	824000	building a group of professional peers and friends,
824000	826000	really a professional learning network,
826000	828000	if you're doing those things which you should be doing already,
828000	830000	then you've already learned the skill,
830000	832000	and you haven't had to pay any money to college to learn it.
832000	835000	You haven't become dependent on the college to cover that.
835000	839000	And the colleges have an entire ecosystem of dependency
839000	842000	because they keep pumping in the whole alumni thing,
842000	844000	give us more money, come back as an alum,
844000	846000	help other people who go to this college
846000	851000	because you like our college better than all the other colleges, right?
851000	852000	No.
852000	855000	I think it's a mistake for many people.
855000	856000	So those are the five things.
856000	859000	So if you go to WGU, how are you going to meet those other two needs?
859000	861000	Learning how to do your own laundry?
861000	863000	And what was the other one?
863000	865000	Making money throughout your career?
865000	867000	Meeting other people, I think.
867000	870000	Learning how to adult is the thing.
870000	872000	The best way to do that, and I'm going to share a story here,
872000	874000	the best way to learn how to adult and to meet other people on,
874000	876000	oh, no, discover yourself, discover who you want to be.
876000	884000	So I have a story from somebody that is indirect that I read some time ago.
884000	886000	It was about a woman who went to college.
886000	887000	She went to Harvard.
887000	888000	She graduated in Harvard.
888000	890000	And I don't remember her degree.
890000	894000	And she wrote an article, I believe it's on Medium,
894000	897000	that said everything, the most important things I learned,
897000	899000	I didn't learn from college.
899000	902000	And it's pretty much, the summary of it is,
902000	905000	she went bureau packing.
905000	907000	She went, you know, backpacking in Europe
907000	909000	and living on the total cheap.
909000	912000	And she just accounts, she just recounts all of the
912000	915000	really life-changing experiences that happened to her
915000	918000	while she was just walking around Europe,
918000	920000	meeting different people, staying in hostels,
920000	924000	getting to know, you know, others,
924000	927000	and also thinking about what she wanted to be,
927000	930000	who she was going to be, what she was going to do with her life,
930000	932000	and a lot of time to think and stuff.
932000	934000	Some people do Appalachian trails.
934000	937000	Some people live out of their car and travel across the country.
937000	941000	You know, there are lots of opportunities to discover yourself
941000	943000	that do not have college impact.
943000	947000	And I would suggest that college is probably one of the worst places
947000	949000	for you to discover yourself.
949000	953000	It's a great place to be exposed to new ideas,
953000	955000	ideas that you might not have been exposed to
955000	957000	because you didn't know about that book,
957000	959000	or you didn't know who Joseph Campbell was,
959000	961000	or you didn't know, I mean, there's a million things
961000	963000	that you may not have known.
963000	966000	But if you learn early, maybe after watching this video,
966000	969000	that you can build yourself an autodidactic learning plan,
969000	973000	that includes reading and learning about the things
973000	977000	that constitute the bulk of self-discovery at college.
977000	978000	You can do it.
978000	981000	You can make your own self-discovery course,
981000	983000	or your own thing.
983000	985000	And it can include interactions with others.
985000	987000	It can include traveling the world.
987000	992000	And it's going to be way, way, way cheaper than a study abroad.
992000	994000	Story about that, when I did study abroad,
994000	996000	I was like, I don't have the money.
996000	998000	I was working three jobs to get myself through college,
998000	999000	and this was in the 90s.
999000	1002000	I don't know how people go to college now, right?
1002000	1003000	And I was working three jobs.
1003000	1005000	I was like, I don't have money to pay $4,000
1005000	1007000	to go on a Russian study abroad.
1007000	1009000	So you know what I did?
1009000	1011000	I was like, let me see if I can find a job.
1011000	1012000	So I found a job.
1012000	1014000	I found and got a job being an American,
1014000	1017000	being a Russian cruise translator,
1017000	1020000	which I later kept growing that job.
1020000	1022000	Got a lot of experience in Russia.
1022000	1025000	It was one of the most proficient Russian speakers
1025000	1026000	in my entire Russian department
1026000	1030000	because I was making money working in Russia.
1030000	1032000	And I didn't have to do a study abroad for that.
1032000	1034000	So I got paid to go to Russia.
1034000	1036000	They paid to go to Russia.
1036000	1038000	You know what a lot of those people who did a study abroad did?
1038000	1040000	They would go to Russia, and because they didn't,
1040000	1042000	usually they weren't paying themselves, by the way.
1042000	1043000	There was somebody else who was paying.
1043000	1044000	They would go to Russia.
1044000	1047000	They would go with their American roommate.
1047000	1049000	They would travel all around.
1049000	1050000	They'd speak English the whole time.
1050000	1051000	They wouldn't learn anything.
1051000	1053000	So they would be $4,000 lighter.
1053000	1054000	They'd come back.
1054000	1055000	They didn't have any Russian skill.
1055000	1058000	And they had no other experiences to talk or to speak of.
1058000	1062000	Meanwhile, I came back and I had a lot of real solid experience
1062000	1066000	teaching people English, teaching them business skills,
1066000	1069000	and learning how to do the whole thing in general.
1069000	1074000	So the point of it is if you're going to be able to do this long term,
1074000	1075000	you need to really have a plan,
1075000	1079000	and that plan should include self-discovery at a regular time.
1079000	1081000	You don't need college for that.
1081000	1084000	And whatever techniques you learn to find yourself,
1084000	1086000	such as yoga or going on a bike trip,
1086000	1088000	you should be doing that anyway, right?
1088000	1090000	You should be learning those skills anyway.
1090000	1093000	So don't necessarily have to go to college for that.
1093000	1096000	Even if you do go to college, figure out what that is.
1096000	1100000	I don't need a field trip in my Russian honors class
1100000	1102000	to show me Arches National Park
1102000	1105000	so that I can basically get Mormon stoned
1105000	1110000	and recite poetry under an arch in southern Utah.
1110000	1111000	I can do that all on my own.
1111000	1114000	I don't need to pay money for that, right?
1114000	1118000	So that's what I would suggest.
1118000	1120000	And hopefully that's been a summary
1120000	1122000	of whether you should go to college or not,
1122000	1124000	and what are some of the things.
1124000	1126000	This is a really tough decision,
1126000	1129000	and the decision about whether to go to college or not
1129000	1133000	is fundamentally colored by those five things.
1133000	1135000	Go ahead and review those for yourself.
1135000	1136000	And let me know what you think.
1136000	1137000	Put it in the comments.
1137000	1141000	That's just my idea that I've had with others
1141000	1143000	as we've talked about whether they should go or not.
1143000	1148000	And I do think that most people should get a college degree,
1148000	1150000	and I'll do another video on that
1150000	1153000	about how to get the college degree as cheap as possible
1153000	1157000	if that works for you and your career plan.
1157000	1158000	And you should have that plan
1158000	1160000	before you even think about going to college.
1160000	1162000	I know it's crazy.
1162000	1164000	Can you imagine actually knowing what you want to be in life
1164000	1166000	before you go to college?
1166000	1169000	It can be done. I've seen it.
