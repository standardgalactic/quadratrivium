So, welcome to Q&A QCA, Questions, Conversations, and Advice with RDBxRob and my absolutely crazy community,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
which happens to be international. And so the first question today is, what is the best way to learn foreign languages?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And we've been actually having fun here because somebody asked me to, oh god, what are you sending us?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm a little bit afraid. I'm a little afraid of what this is. Somebody's sending us random things.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, I told you I can speak Russian.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Somebody said, wait, wait, wait, can you speak French with...

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You don't speak French like an American. You speak French like a French person.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And I was like, well, thank you. That's very nice.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And then I proceeded to like try every American accent I could.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So this has been like the theme for like the last five minutes.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And then said he says, now do it like a valley girl.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I want to do it very well.
