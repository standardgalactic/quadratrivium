0	7400	Okay, people, I've had a number of people ask me how to do T-Mux and whether to use it
7400	13800	and what it's about, and actually some people like me have struggled with the defaults.
13800	14800	Don't feel bad.
14800	15800	A lot of people do.
15800	22000	Particularly people who have come to it from another terminal multiplexer called Screen.
22000	26000	So I want to first of all, I want to talk about Screen.
26000	29400	I want to talk about the very first multiplexer, what a multiplexer is.
29400	35400	Screen is, what T-Mux is, and why you should care, and how you should use it.
35400	37400	Hopefully this will go pretty quickly.
37400	42400	If I go too fast for you, you can always redo it, or you can come get on our stream.
42400	48400	rwxrob.live will take it to our YouTube, and then you can go to our Twitch if you have a question.
48400	51400	And our communities will be happy to help you.
51400	55400	So let's start out with talking about what it is.
56400	58400	So I'm going to pull up a terminal.
58400	59400	That's a pretty busy terminal.
59400	62400	We've been doing a lot of stuff here, so I'll get that out of the way.
62400	68400	And I'm going to minimize these windows for now.
68400	70400	I'll bring them back, don't you worry.
70400	75400	So we have a terminal here, and I'm going, you can probably see it,
75400	80400	but I'm going to go ahead and boom-bump up the font just a little bit more, as you can see.
80400	83400	So this is a standard terminal.
83400	86400	This is a standard BASH terminal running BASH4 right now.
86400	90400	If you have five or whatever, what we're about to do will work with any shell.
90400	95400	So first of all, I want to introduce you to something called screen.
95400	100400	So from a terminal, you type in, and we're not going to cover terminals today, so we're just going to type screen.
100400	105400	So the screen program comes by default on all unixies by default.
105400	109400	Any unices, anything older than 10, 15 years.
109400	112400	But it's been since kind of removed because it's sort of optional,
112400	115400	and generally speaking, people will use Tmux instead.
115400	118400	Why does screen matter? Isn't this video about Tmux?
118400	121400	Well, it's kind of about both, and this is why.
121400	127400	So if you ever want to get the benefits of screen, which I'll go into right now,
127400	134400	you want to always configure screen.
134400	137400	Let me get it installed.
137400	141400	There we go.
141400	145400	Being a long password, sorry for that.
145400	152400	We're going to install screen, and however, screen usually comes on most systems.
152400	159400	And the reason I'm going to tell you about screen is because you should learn screen at the same time that you learn Tmux,
159400	166400	because if your priority is working productively on a terminal on any computer in the world,
166400	171400	including, you know, ancient SCO systems, AIX, Solaris, all of that,
171400	176400	then you really need to learn the world's oldest multiplexer.
176400	178400	So what does multiplexer mean?
178400	181400	Plex means screen, right?
181400	184400	Or, you know, something to look through.
184400	186400	You can think of like Cineplex, right?
186400	189400	Multiple cinema screens.
189400	192400	So multiplexer is a way to deal with multiple screens.
192400	198400	Screen was the first multiplexer, and it was created to deal with the situation where you have one, you know,
198400	203400	green cathode ray monitor, and you can't do anything else on it.
203400	207400	You only have that one terminal, and God help you if you need to do anything else,
207400	210400	because you only have one terminal, period.
210400	216400	And so I would, so, you know, like right now, if I only have one terminal, I can't really do anything else, actually.
216400	220400	In order for me to properly test this, I need to fire up a different terminal.
220400	222400	So I'm going to do that properly.
222400	224400	So this is a better simulation.
224400	231400	It's a little small, but this is a better simulation of what you might experience in 1978, let's say.
231400	237400	Or, you know, even all the way through the 90s and early 2000s, before T-Mux was invented.
237400	242400	I'm trying to make my font sizes increase, and I can't remember how to do it.
242400	243400	Oh, there it is.
243400	246400	Yeah, so it's just, this is a lacquerty.
246400	249400	In case you haven't know, this was written in Rust.
249400	259400	So I'm going to actually leave it at 80 by 80 on purpose, because, or relatively close to that.
259400	264400	Just to kind of give you the simulation of what it's like to just pretend you have a terminal only.
264400	268400	This big old long prompt is not anything you would ever have at that time.
268400	269400	But that's fine.
269400	275400	In fact, I normally prefer a smaller prompt, but for the streaming, I have a kind of fun, big long one.
275400	279400	All right, we're clearly going to be interrupted a little bit by home noises here.
279400	281400	I hope that's okay.
281400	287400	Okay, so next let's do, let's use, let's simulate the problem.
287400	290400	So I'm doing LS, maybe I'm running top.
290400	297400	My version of top, you might know this is more your version of top user, user bin top.
297400	300400	So you're running top, and you know, this is old school top.
300400	303400	You can see like something's really pegging my CPU.
303400	306400	It's probably OBS.
306400	307400	You know, like, oh, that's really great.
307400	310400	But how do I do something else while top is running?
310400	316400	You know, so in this particular environment, you have to close something down, and then you have to restart something else.
316400	326400	If I want to do LS or if I want to do, I don't know, PS-EF, and then I want to grep the number for the PID to see what's causing all the hassle.
326400	329400	So I do, you know, grep 539 so I can find it.
329400	331400	So that's a pretty standard thing.
331400	333400	Okay, well, it might have changed in the meantime, right?
333400	339400	So maybe I want to leave it running and I want to be able to switch back and forth between the two really quickly.
339400	342400	Well, I can't, unless you're really fast typist, you know, you can't really do that.
342400	348400	So it would be really great if I had two windows or two sort of half windows, even if you could do that.
348400	352400	And that's really the difference between screen and Tmux.
352400	356400	So screen was the first thing invented to create multiple windows.
356400	362400	And by typing screen, you're able to start, it starts up and then you have to push enter or something.
362400	367400	And it'll come up and it'll give you, it'll give you your prompt.
367400	370400	Now, it also threw out my colors and everything.
370400	372400	That's interesting. I wasn't expecting that to happen.
372400	380400	So that means that when you're running under screens, since it is so old, it doesn't have support for color, two to six colors and all the other things that you might normally have support for.
380400	382400	So here we are.
382400	385400	And I have my terminal, at least I have, you know, a window.
385400	387400	Well, why does this thing?
387400	390400	So now I can run top my, well, that's really crazy.
390400	391400	Why does that top work?
391400	392400	Right? The other one doesn't.
392400	393400	I don't know.
393400	394400	That's kind of a fun, fun thing.
394400	395400	I'll have to figure that out.
395400	397400	So user been top.
397400	405400	And when we run user been top, we have this, but now while this is running, I can actually do control a and then type C.
405400	407400	Pardon me.
415400	423400	I don't know if it's safe to talk again.
423400	424400	I'll go ahead.
424400	425400	I'm going to have to clip the video.
425400	427400	They don't know what I'm here.
427400	428400	I'm torturing them.
428400	430400	I need a better studio.
430400	433400	Um, all right.
433400	437400	So when I do this, I get no other window.
437400	438400	There's no other window.
438400	444400	So that was me doing control a, a, but if I do control a, C, it creates a new window.
444400	448400	And I can see all my windows with control a, w.
448400	453400	And so down below it says you have, there's a, there's a window zero, there's a zero and a one.
453400	459400	And I can switch between the windows by doing control a, zero, control a, one.
459400	464400	You can name them and do all kinds of things, but fundamentally that's how you get around.
464400	472400	If you want to toggle between the two windows, you do control a, a, control a, a, and I'm just holding control down and tapping a twice.
472400	473400	So I can do that really fast.
473400	477400	So if I wanted to, I could go back here and see, okay, five, three, nine, nine.
477400	485400	I can go over here, PSDF, grep, five, three, nine, nine to see what's, whoops, wrong one, five, three, nine, nine.
485400	487400	And I could go back over here and see what's going on.
487400	493400	I could even kill it, which I won't do because I don't know what it is, but you know what, you see my point.
493400	494400	So I can go through here.
494400	498400	I can even add another window, control a, c again, control a, c.
498400	500400	And now I can control a, w.
500400	501400	You can see them all here.
501400	503400	And I can pick one.
503400	508400	So control a, one, control a, what was it, zero, control a and two.
508400	510400	So now I have all of these windows.
510400	518400	No, you're probably wondering, well, wouldn't it be great if I could split the window in half and then do something with the window?
518400	522400	And that is where we run into a problem.
522400	525400	But before we go there, I'm going to talk about that later with me talk about Tmux.
525400	530400	There are two great advantages for screen, two main reasons that screen was created.
530400	534400	The first is what I told you, managing screen real estate and windows.
534400	538400	So you're able to go back and forth between your windows pretty easily.
538400	546400	So control a is how you go between the two windows in screen.
546400	550400	And it's always, and since the dawn of time, the default of screen is control a.
550400	551400	Okay.
551400	553400	And so that's all well and good.
553400	556400	But here's something you might not have thought about.
556400	561400	So let's pretend that I lose my connection.
561400	562400	Okay.
562400	563400	Let's pretend.
563400	570400	Now this is going to be a little tricky because I have, I'm trying to put two windows.
570400	571400	I'm trying to simulate.
571400	579400	So for example, let's pretend I'm remotely connected to a system in New York or something like a digital ocean server and or any server really.
579400	582400	And, and so let's pretend like I lose the connection.
582400	588400	Well, you could either lose the connection by having someone click X and like, oh crap, I had that background.
588400	590400	I have been running that compile for the last hour.
590400	593400	I've been running this background process forever.
593400	595400	I've been running a backup system.
595400	598400	And so you're, you're dead, right?
598400	602400	I mean, and if you're working remotely, that's really, really dangerous.
602400	608400	If you're, I did, I worked remotely for, I've been for 10 years, one of the office, maybe five times out of that entire time.
608400	617400	And because of that, if, if something were to go wrong in one case, they actually, truly I lost my power during a meal and really important process.
617400	620400	And if I had not been running screen, I would be sad.
620400	622400	It's the same at least.
622400	632400	So, so what you can do is you can do screen, screen dash LS and it'll show you all the screens that you have.
632400	637400	And then you can reconnect to that screen by doing screen.
637400	639400	I don't remember the screen command.
639400	640400	I'm going to have to look it up.
640400	642400	I use, because I know the team looks one though.
642400	643400	What is it?
643400	644400	Is it dash R guys?
644400	645400	Is it dash R?
645400	646400	I think it's reattached.
646400	648400	Yep, that's it.
648400	650400	So now I can do control AW.
650400	653400	And there you see all of my stuff is still there.
653400	659400	And my top is even running still, still the same, same exact process.
659400	661400	The process has never stopped running.
661400	669400	Now, if I want to, if I know I'm going to leave and I don't want to just close my window, I can actually forcibly detach with the control AD.
669400	671400	And that detaches from the session.
671400	673400	So screen dash LS.
673400	676400	Okay, so you can see I've got a running session.
676400	678400	It's a good idea to do that no matter what.
678400	680400	If you do screen, I think it's dash X.
680400	683400	I think that will automatically connect to the last available screen.
683400	685400	That's another one you can do.
685400	691400	So you can read about screen and all of its specifics, but I just kind of want to overview for you how it works.
691400	698400	And the reason I'm telling you about screen first is because this is going to directly affect how you configure Tmux.
698400	701400	And you'll understand why now.
701400	704400	So control AD, I'm going to disconnect that.
704400	707400	Actually, I think I'm probably just going to close down all those screens.
707400	712400	There is one other advantage of screen that I cannot demonstrate without being on a multi-user system.
712400	720400	But if more than one person is logged into the same account and they connect to the same screen session, they literally share a keyboard.
720400	722400	It's the same. They can type.
722400	724400	The other person can backspace it out.
724400	731400	And so if you're doing any pair programming of that kind or if you're doing any root cause analysis or any hacking of any kind,
731400	735400	all of those things can be shared directly or even education.
735400	741400	I've used this a lot for education because I've allowed somebody to type something and then told them over the phone or over Discord,
741400	743400	this is what you need to type.
743400	748400	So that's a third kind of way to use screen and or Tmux.
748400	760400	But the two primary reasons to use screen and Tmux are to manage different windows and real estate and to provide a connection that's still going to be running.
760400	764400	So one practical application of that, by the way, is to run a Minecraft server.
764400	768400	So Minecraft server, I get this a lot because I deal with a lot of people who like that.
768400	775400	And Minecraft servers are fundamentally unable to handle, you know, they have a terminal and all that stuff.
775400	781400	But when they're running from a Linux system or a unique system of any kind, they don't have a very intelligent terminal.
781400	788400	So what you have to do is you run screen or Tmux first and then you start up your Minecraft.
788400	790400	And then when you want to come back to it, you reconnect to it.
790400	796400	If you start Minecraft up and you disconnect, you know, you lose it, right?
796400	802400	And because Minecraft is not a truly integrated server like a web server or mail server or something like that,
802400	808400	that's really the preferred way to do it as opposed to making a full blown server out of it.
808400	811400	Okay, so let's let's move on to Tmux.
811400	814400	So let me first kill all of my screen processes.
814400	819400	I'm going to start up screen dash x, by the way, what happens if I start screen without a dash x?
819400	821400	I start up a new session, right?
821400	824400	This is a really common problem I see all the time.
824400	826400	People forget to do dash x or dash r.
826400	829400	And so then they end up with this like, where's my session?
829400	831400	It's not there. It actually is there.
831400	834400	Now you have two sessions, right?
834400	838400	So I'm going to just do screen dash x and to pick up the last session.
838400	841400	It's like, see the screen screen is actually a little dumber than Tmux.
841400	844400	It's like, I don't know which one you want, dude, which one do you want to connect to?
844400	846400	So it's like, okay, so let's do dash r.
846400	850400	And then we'll do let's see ptspid.
850400	852400	I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste this.
852400	853400	I'm going to cheat.
853400	855400	You couldn't do that on the old terminals.
855400	858400	But so now here's my thing and I'm going to cancel this.
858400	860400	I'm going to exit and I'm going to exit this.
860400	862400	I'm going to exit here.
862400	865400	And now screen is completely and totally terminated.
865400	869400	If you haven't noticed, screen doesn't give you much indication that that you're using it.
869400	872400	So you have to kind of check whether you're using it or not.
872400	875400	And I actually like that it doesn't get in your way.
875400	878400	As far as you know, it's just another screen, just another terminal.
878400	882400	And that you're going to see is a significant difference from the default Tmux settings.
882400	885400	Okay, so let's move to Tmux now.
885400	890400	When you're running Tmux, you have a similar situation.
890400	896400	I had a little bit of a problem here because I have configured my Tmux already.
896400	903400	So I'm actually going to break my Tmux for a second in order to just use the default.
904400	914400	I don't know what to even call Tmux to goodtmux.com.
914400	918400	So by doing that, I have broken my Tmux configuration.
918400	923400	There is a screen configuration, but I've never seen it used
923400	928400	and it really doesn't make sense to do anything with screen in terms of configuring it
928400	931400	because screen is so universal.
931400	935400	Screen does also have some ancient, they probably fixed them all by now,
935400	940400	but it didn't have some ancient system situations where it might mess with memory or stuff.
940400	942400	And so Tmux came along.
942400	947400	Tmux is a great project, which probably spent a little time talking about where to get it.
947400	952400	For the most part, you just do sudo apt install Tmux, but these days it's on everything.
952400	957400	I'm just going to do a quick search on duck.go for Tmux to see what's out there.
957400	961400	So Tmux is a multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems.
961400	965400	So Tmux is basically the descendant of screen.
965400	969400	But there's some pretty significant design problems that the Tmux team made
969400	974400	that I go back and forth between hating and loving.
974400	981400	So for the most part, when Tmux came to be, Tmux offers brings two new things to the table.
981400	984400	One of them is that it allows you to split the screen.
985400	989400	And when you split the screen, you can change.
989400	993400	You know, it's designed for screens that are a little bit bigger than our standard screen.
993400	998400	So let's make a bigger screen here and let's examine the value proposition of Tmux.
998400	1005400	So if I run Tmux, which now should be the default, I can just do Tmux and I don't get it.
1005400	1008400	Wait, I think I might still be using my config.
1008400	1010400	Let me just check.
1010400	1014400	Yeah, I'm still using this.
1014400	1018400	I don't think I've successfully failed to not use mine.
1018400	1026400	So I'm just going to finish this video and tell you how to use Tmux by using it the way I have configured it
1026400	1028400	rather than telling you how to use the default.
1028400	1034400	So I'll jump right into a description of why I am choosing to use the Tmux configuration that I do use.
1034400	1039400	So where did my Tmux configure?
1039400	1042400	What did I rename it?
1042400	1045400	Oh, good Tmux.com.
1045400	1047400	Tmux.com.
1047400	1055400	So the reason that I have configured my Tmux this way and you can get just let me show you right away.
1055400	1059400	I've showed this in other videos, but right now it's currently in GitHub.
1059400	1065400	I may move to GitLab, but right now under my config, which is github.com.
1065400	1071400	You can go find my Tmux.com.
1071400	1073400	It's the only file you need.
1073400	1079400	And I suggest creating symbolic link from your home directory, which is where it will be picked up automatically
1079400	1083400	and putting it there.
1084400	1089400	And this one, it doesn't have a lot of instructions in it.
1089400	1093400	This is not original by any sense.
1093400	1103400	This is a configuration that I found about six years ago and I've tweaked that made Tmux behave like screen.
1103400	1106400	And you might ask, well, why would you do that?
1106400	1109400	Why would you want to change the defaults on Tmux?
1109400	1119400	And that is a really, really interesting question because there's actually strong arguments both ways, right?
1119400	1128400	If you change Tmux to behave like screen, then the muscle memory that you've developed for using screen carries over to Tmux.
1128400	1131400	So that's the number one reason that I do it.
1131400	1138400	So that means that I have, we'll talk about splitting panes and stuff, but it means that up, down, left, right.
1138400	1146400	I mean, most importantly, the key for, they call it the prefix key is not control B, which is the default.
1146400	1149400	I've changed mine to be control A.
1149400	1151400	And that's a pretty big deal.
1151400	1154400	It might be controversial, but a lot of people do that.
1154400	1163400	And the reason they do it is because they've been using screen their whole life or they expect that they will only have access to screen on, you know, hundreds of systems when they need it.
1163400	1168400	So this is a common way to get around that problem.
1168400	1175400	And then, you know, I've done some other binding where control AA does the same thing in Tmux that it did in screen.
1175400	1182400	So long and short of it is this configuration is compatible with screen.
1183400	1185400	So screen and Tmux are the same.
1185400	1190400	Everything you do on screen for the most part is the same thing in Tmux.
1190400	1198400	And then anything that's new in Tmux, I've added other more intuitive bindings.
1198400	1204400	For example, I don't even remember what it is to split a pane in half, but we're about to see this.
1204400	1209400	So I use this, I use a bar to split.
1209400	1211400	I use a slash to split.
1211400	1215400	I use a dash, which reminds me of a line to split horizontally.
1215400	1219400	And I have moved my navigation to use the VI keys.
1219400	1228400	So my VI keys are used to both navigate between panes and to move a pane to resize a pane.
1228400	1230400	And I'll demonstrate that now.
1230400	1233400	And then, of course, I have no arrow keys.
1233400	1238400	I've disabled the arrow keys because I don't like allowing myself to be.
1238400	1242400	And I work with young people that I don't want to pick up the habit of using arrow keys
1242400	1245400	because you don't have arrow keys 90% of the time when you're on a system.
1245400	1247400	That goes for VI as well.
1247400	1248400	That's a different video.
1248400	1252400	So I will go back to Alacrity and here we have our Tmux session running.
1252400	1256400	My configuration of Tmux running, it's probably good we're doing this
1256400	1259400	because I don't even know the default Tmux keys anymore.
1259400	1263400	I couldn't even tell you other than the prefixes control B.
1263400	1270400	So when I split the screen, I can do control A and the pipe key or the slash key,
1270400	1274400	which is right above the return key on my keyboard.
1274400	1281400	And that mnemonic of being an up and down line helps me to remember that that's the split.
1281400	1287400	It also helps my nine-year-olds that are learning how to use Tmux to remember it as well.
1287400	1292400	If I want to split one of these in half vertically, I suppose,
1292400	1296400	then I do control A and then dash or underscore.
1296400	1299400	And there are a number of other things you can do here.
1299400	1301400	Tmux has added quite a bit.
1301400	1306400	But the fundamental addition of Tmux to screen is the fact that you have panes.
1306400	1308400	The panes are much more complicated there.
1308400	1314400	I've also bound control AW, which we used in screen earlier, to show you what we have.
1314400	1318400	So this shows you all of the different Tmux sessions I have running on the system.
1318400	1320400	And I can switch between the windows.
1320400	1323400	But now instead of it just being switching between windows,
1323400	1326400	it's switching between sets of panes.
1326400	1329400	So in this case, I have a set of three panes.
1329400	1332400	And there's all sorts of extra fun things you can do.
1332400	1335400	So you can do control A, T to show the current time.
1335400	1340400	You can control A, Q to show you what size I'm doing again.
1340400	1342400	It shows you where you are.
1342400	1344400	You can actually swap things out.
1344400	1346400	You can script all of these things too.
1346400	1348400	And you can tell what size your panes are.
1348400	1353400	To resize a pane, for me, is control I and then control JJJ.
1353400	1355400	That goes down.
1355400	1359400	Control A, control CCCC, or KKK.
1359400	1361400	Control A, KKKK.
1361400	1363400	Control A, HHHHH.
1363400	1365400	Control A, LLL.
1365400	1368400	Control A, you have to hold control down, LLLLL.
1368400	1371400	Now, and to navigate between the two, instead of holding control down,
1371400	1378400	I just do control AH, control AL, control A, let go K,
1378400	1382400	control A, let go J, control A, let go H.
1382400	1385400	So you can quickly navigate around and you can pop off, you know,
1385400	1386400	as many as you want.
1386400	1388400	You can just keep going all the way.
1388400	1390400	And you can have a lot of fun with this.
1390400	1392400	I mean, you can make a little time thing down here.
1392400	1396400	You can maybe do T matrix over here.
1396400	1399400	You know, you can have all kinds of interesting things.
1399400	1403400	You can like, I don't know, you can make, you can ask your, all sorts of things.
1403400	1407400	So as you can imagine, you can really make strong, you can take it,
1407400	1411400	and by the way, remember that thing with screen where you could add another window?
1411400	1412400	We still have that.
1412400	1416400	So if that, if that kind of screen real estate isn't good enough for you,
1416400	1421400	you can still do control A, C to create a screen, just like screen.
1421400	1424400	And now I have this one, right?
1424400	1425400	And it's a brand new one.
1425400	1429400	So if I do control AA, just like screen, it goes back to my other pain set.
1429400	1432400	It toggles back and forth and type exit.
1432400	1439400	You can zoom in on the pain, control AZ, and it zooms in and I can do control AZ again.
1439400	1440400	I don't recommend that.
1440400	1444400	However, if you want to separate a pain out into its own window,
1444400	1449400	that's control a exclamation point and that will take it out.
1449400	1450400	And now it's his own window.
1450400	1452400	So I can go back and forth.
1452400	1454400	Usually that's what you want to do by the way.
1454400	1459400	I've learned just through sad experience that most of the time when I want,
1459400	1466400	when I think that I want to zoom, what I really want to do is have a new pain
1466400	1469400	because I get over here and I forget that I'm in a zoomed in pain.
1469400	1473400	And then I try to split and then I get that it splits it.
1473400	1474400	And it goes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1474400	1475400	Okay, I was just zoomed.
1475400	1481400	So there's a difference between zooming and there's a difference between whether you're doing.
1482400	1485400	How come my status bar is not the default?
1485400	1492400	My status bar is not the default because I have changed all of my defaults to use Tmux.conf.
1492400	1498400	So as I mentioned earlier, I'm using my own Tmux.conf, which also turns off the status bar.
1498400	1500400	I am not a fan of the status bar.
1500400	1510400	Again, I want it to behave just like screen and I can pull up anything that I could possibly dream of looking at from just looking at control AW.
1510400	1512400	I don't need a status bar.
1512400	1516400	A status bar is a distraction to me and it's unnecessary.
1516400	1521400	So a lot of people disagree with that, but that's why I don't have a status bar here.
1521400	1526400	But this is covered pretty much in a whirlwind fashion.
1526400	1531400	What the difference between Tmux is and what's the difference between screen is.
1531400	1537400	If you haven't noticed, I prefer this over multiple terminals because multiple reasons.
1537400	1542400	Number one, I can just detach from it and do it remotely.
1542400	1554400	So by reducing the ways that I manage my real estate on my terminal to one common way, I can use that wherever I am.
1554400	1563400	So a lot of people spend a lot of time configuring their desktop manager or their window manager and they've got these really great hotkeys and they move everything around.
1563400	1570400	And I find that a waste of time because I can train myself to use Tmux effectively.
1570400	1579400	And as long as it's screen compatible, if I'm on another system, on another terminal someplace, I can use screen.
1579400	1584400	And when I'm using screen over there, if they don't have screen, I can copy Tmux over.
1584400	1588400	Unfortunately, I do have to copy my Tmux config or I'm totally lost.
1588400	1593400	And that's a big argument against customizing your Tmux in the way I have.
1593400	1599400	Purist might argue that using Tmux's defaults is the best way.
1599400	1605400	I use Tmux like other people might use Emacs or any other IDEs.
1605400	1614400	Therefore, and because it's going with screen, if I'm on a remote system, I depend more fully on screen being the same over everywhere it is.
1614400	1619400	So I've deliberately not customized my screen, which you can anyway, but I haven't customized my use of screen.
1619400	1624400	So if I'm on a remote system, I can at least have the base functionality there.
1624400	1631400	And I allow myself the liberty of using Tmux the way I want to configure it in my particular case.
1631400	1636400	And so if you like the status bar at the bottom of your Tmux, I'm not arguing against that.
1636400	1639400	I'm just saying that that's just not my thing.
1639400	1647400	So Tmux is actually part of four, I believe, critical command line tools.
1647400	1652400	Terminal tools that make up, you know, the terminal master suite, I call it.
1652400	1657400	VI for me, Tmux, Bash and Lynx.
1657400	1661400	And I've done another video on why Lynx is the best web browser.
1661400	1663400	It's how fast it is.
1663400	1669400	When you combine those four items together, you have, I believe, the most powerful IDE in the universe.
1669400	1671400	And it uses nothing but your terminal.
1671400	1676400	And so when you combine those, you have to combine them properly, though.
1676400	1681400	And when you combine them, then value propositions of things like Emacs kind of fade away.
1681400	1687400	Because value propositions of things like NeoVim, which allow multiple paints, also fade away.
1687400	1693400	I would rather have multiple single paints running Vim without needing paints through NeoVim.
1693400	1701400	So my way of managing real estate is universal, as opposed to not having NeoVim on any given target system.
1701400	1706400	So I would rather build a dependency on the tools that I know are going to be on the system.
1706400	1713400	Because while I want to have an IDE that's powerful on my local system that's terminal based,
1713400	1718400	I also want the ability to get on any system anytime and be completely functional,
1718400	1722400	whether I break into that system or I'm being paid to administer it.
1722400	1726400	So this is my justification for how I've configured Tmux.
1726400	1732400	Just as a reminder, we went into this talking about what a multiplexer is.
1732400	1737400	And then we went ahead and I showed you how to use screen and where it came from
1737400	1742400	and how it's used to manage both screen real estate windows
1742400	1746400	and it's also used to keep a connection up, a persistent connection.
1746400	1751400	And then we went forward and we talked about how Tmux is added onto that
1751400	1755400	by being able to split that real estate even further into multiple paints,
1755400	1758400	even though it also has multiple windows.
1758400	1761400	And then we've talked about how to integrate that into your development environment
1761400	1764400	and a little bit about why you might change the defaults.
1764400	1769400	The source, once again, as I end the video here is github.com.
1769400	1771400	Slash rwx slash rob slash config.
1771400	1774400	And if you look in there, you will find my Tmux.conf.
1774400	1781400	All you need to do to get that to work is to put that Tmux.conf file in your home directory.
1781400	1783400	Here, I'll list mine here now.
1783400	1788400	Slash.tmux.conf.
1789400	1791400	And there is mine.
1791400	1794400	Oops, dash l and I'm going to use you.
1794400	1799400	As you can see, my Tmux is a symbolic link that points to the Tmux
1799400	1802400	in one of my github repos that I managed this way
1802400	1807400	and I strongly suggest that you manage your own configuration files
1807400	1812400	or dot files that way so that you don't lose them after you've configured them.
1812400	1817400	All right, I hope this has been somewhat helpful and you can make sense of it.
1817400	1821400	There's a lot of assumed sort of Linux knowledge going on there
1821400	1823400	so if you need some help, you can look at the other videos
1823400	1827400	or you can come check with our little community over on rdbxrob.
1827400	1831400	And I'm going to go ahead and open up the chat now.
1831400	1834400	So let me bring that back.
1834400	1836400	I might have to read back for quite a bit,
1836400	1839400	but I'm going to answer some specific questions here
1839400	1842400	and see how far back I have to go.
1842400	1844400	All right.
1844400	1846400	Node.
1846400	1850400	More of its stuff.
1850400	1852400	This is essentially what I want to set up.
1852400	1855400	Being able to have my dev environment on a remote machine that is always running
1855400	1858400	so I can just detach detach from any of my machines
1858400	1862400	when I want without losing state and I power down and close terminals.
1862400	1867400	M-Tem, that is exactly, exactly why I do this.
1867400	1868400	It's exactly why I do it.
1868400	1872400	It's also why I maintain my entire configuration in a single file
1872400	1874400	on a Git repo so I can run curl,
1874400	1876400	pull the thing down onto any remote system
1876400	1879400	and be instantly back where I need to be.
1879400	1881400	Assuming the applications I use are on there,
1881400	1887400	namely Vim, Tmux, Bash Course, and Lynx,
1887400	1889400	which is a harder one to get installed,
1889400	1895400	but usually I can get away with doing my searches and stuff with Lynx on a local system.
1895400	1898400	Shared bindings are very useful and kind of avoid conflict.
1898400	1902400	This is why most programs share bindings with Vim, right?
1902400	1906400	And that's why I have configured my Tmux to use Vim bindings.
1906400	1908400	My fingers know Vim.
1908400	1910400	My Lynx is configured to Vim.
1910400	1913400	My Bash History is configured to Vim.
1913400	1918400	I would argue very strongly that the most important reason for you to use Vim
1918400	1923400	is because of all the Vim bindings that are built into everything else.
1924400	1927400	Every other tool has Vim bindings,
1927400	1931400	and Vim bindings were created at a time when there were no mice,
1931400	1932400	but that doesn't matter.
1932400	1934400	It still makes you a thousand times more efficient
1934400	1938400	because there's much less travel for your hand to go elsewhere for different things.
1938400	1940400	So this is very useful. Thank you.
1940400	1945400	If you can't remember that, just what is this?
1945400	1947400	I'm a little bit afraid to click on it.
1947400	1949400	I'm going to go ahead and do that though.
1949400	1951400	Let's see if it comes up.
1951400	1953400	What is this, MTem?
1953400	1955400	Am I going to be sad?
1957400	1959400	I clicked on it twice, so we might get two.
1963400	1965400	We're just waiting for this to come up.
1967400	1969400	Tmux cheat sheet.
1969400	1972400	Tmux A. Oh, I see. That's nice.
1972400	1974400	Let's bookmark that for the crowd.
1974400	1980400	Okay, so MTem has shared with us a link he's found to Tmux Shortcuts and Cheat Sheet.
1980400	1984400	Now, we just scratched the surface of Tmux.
1984400	1988400	Tmux has an immense amount of things that can be customized,
1988400	1991400	and that's one of the best parts of it,
1991400	1995400	but it does make it very hard to learn even the basics.
1995400	1999400	Whenever I run Tmux, it's probably really important that you understand this.
1999400	2001400	I use the Tmux space A,
2001400	2004400	and what A does is that reconnects to the last thing.
2004400	2006400	I forgot to mention that, but that's important.
2006400	2009400	After you create a Tmux session the first time,
2009400	2011400	you should always use Tmux A after that,
2011400	2016400	and that will force it to find and connect to the last session that was available.
2016400	2018400	There's other ways to connect to different numbers.
2018400	2019400	There you go.
2019400	2022400	A number Tmux LS is the same as Screen LS.
2022400	2023400	It's a dash LS.
2023400	2025400	It shows you all the sessions.
2025400	2027400	You can kill sessions and blah, blah, blah.
2027400	2030400	I don't want to bog everybody down with all the stuff you can do,
2030400	2033400	but there is a lot that you can do.
2033400	2037400	Some of these pain-splitting things here are not relevant to me
2037400	2039400	because these are the defaults.
2039400	2043400	If you want to understand the defaults, there's a good link for that.
2043400	2046400	I have never learned the defaults because the first moment I learned Tmux,
2046400	2049400	I noticed that the keys were different than Screen,
2049400	2050400	and I was like, this is ridiculous.
2050400	2051400	I'm not doing this.
2051400	2054400	I immediately found the other system administrators
2054400	2059400	who had created configuration files that were based on Screen,
2059400	2061400	and I have never looked back.
2061400	2064400	I would actually completely be lost,
2064400	2067400	but I'm not afraid because I know that on those systems,
2067400	2071400	Screen is also there, so I always have Screen as a backup.
2071400	2075400	People who use Tmux with the default bindings do not know how to use Screen.
2075400	2079400	If they get on a remote system and all it has is Screen, they're done.
2079400	2081400	They can't do anything.
2081400	2084400	They'd have to go back and read all the commands for it.
2084400	2088400	That's also a reason not to use the arrow keys and things like that in VIM.
2088400	2092400	That's a reason to keep your muscle memory consistent and ubiquitous.
2093400	2096400	What else we got here?
2096400	2102400	How come my status bar isn't the default because I overwrote it and I turned it off?
2102400	2104400	That's less of a thing, though.
2104400	2106400	If somebody wanted that, they could keep it.
2106400	2111400	I don't like giving up a full line to status stuff I'm never going to look at.
2111400	2112400	M to M.
2112400	2114400	Oh, I thought you reverted back to the default.
2114400	2115400	I tried, actually.
2115400	2117400	I tried to revert it, but I failed.
2117400	2121400	For some reason, it didn't pick up.
2121400	2122400	I don't know why.
2122400	2125400	When it didn't, I went ahead and just showed you my configuration.
2125400	2130400	I probably would have just flailed around not knowing what to do without this cheat sheet you provided.
2130400	2131400	That's good.
2131400	2135400	I like to shut off my status bar, but I also like having a visual cue of how many windows I have open.
2135400	2136400	That's fine.
2136400	2141400	I mentioned this already, but my way of doing that is this.
2141400	2143400	I do control AW.
2143400	2147400	When I want to see windows, I want to see all the windows.
2147400	2152400	I don't want some little blur constantly bothering me at the bottom of the screen.
2152400	2155400	When I want to know about windows, I want all the windows.
2155400	2157400	I want to do control AW and see them all.
2157400	2162400	That kind of thinking also applies to what I think about IntelliSense.
2162400	2168400	That's when you're using an editor and it's constantly popping up help about what you can tab and get.
2168400	2169400	I absolutely hate that.
2169400	2173400	If I want to look something up, I want to look it up.
2173400	2175400	I want to get examples and everything.
2175400	2178400	I don't want to get constantly prompted and it's super annoying to me.
2178400	2179400	Not just me.
2179400	2185400	I know a lot of veteran developers and system ins who absolutely detest any form of tab completion or IntelliSense,
2185400	2187400	other than the command line bash completion, of course.
2187400	2194400	It's actually faster to look stuff up using links, but that's another video.
2195400	2199400	I like putting system information in the status bar.
2199400	2212400	I like having control A on my local Tmux and having the default control B on the remote servers with the green status bar,
2212400	2214400	especially useful when I SSH.
2214400	2216400	I'm glad Keisler brought that point up.
2216400	2221400	That is the one pain point that I regularly have.
2221400	2226400	If you do what I'm doing and you get on a remote system,
2226400	2231400	if you get on the remote system and it has Tmux,
2231400	2239400	it's probably a good thing that it's not using your bindings because if it were, your bindings will get stolen.
2239400	2244400	It's this whole screen within a screen situation or Tmux within a Tmux situation.
2244400	2247400	I don't know how many times I've been burned by that.
2247400	2250400	I'm running Tmux locally on my computer to do my development,
2250400	2253400	and I connect to another system and I need multiple pains and it's a remote system,
2253400	2255400	so it lets me pull up another Tmux over there.
2255400	2259400	Now when I do control A whatever, who gets it?
2259400	2261400	The remote system? Local system?
2261400	2266400	Well, the answer is the local system gets it, and that might not be what you're expecting.
2266400	2268400	There's two ways to get around that.
2268400	2275400	To do what Keisler says, which is go ahead and use the default bindings on the remote system,
2275400	2278400	which is probably fair to say is going to be the way it's going to be
2278400	2281400	because you're not going to have customized a remote system.
2281400	2293400	That would make sense for you to learn the default bindings for Tmux as well as your personal bindings for Tmux locally.
2293400	2295400	That's one way to do it.
2295400	2298400	Another way to do it would be to not use Tmux remotely, use screen remotely.
2298400	2302400	Nine times out of ten, when I'm connected to a remote system,
2302400	2306400	I do not plan on splitting the pain on that system.
2306400	2308400	I'm not going to be using the real estate.
2308400	2311400	I'm going to just use screen to get multiple windows and that's it.
2311400	2315400	That's still a problem because I bound control A,
2315400	2321400	so now the control A is gobbled up by my local Tmux and it never makes it through to the remote screen.
2321400	2323400	That is a problem.
2323400	2327400	In fact, that's a pretty solid argument against the way I do it.
2327400	2333400	The third way to work around it is that I maintain two different terminals.
2333400	2336400	That's the one time when I might have more than one terminal.
2336400	2341400	I would have alacrity running and then I would have my regular session.
2341400	2348400	To tell you the truth, I like to do that anyway because I like to be very clearly mentally distinguished
2348400	2353400	between my local development environment and my remote system.
2353400	2357400	I have shut down, I'm not exaggerating, I'm a little embarrassed to say it.
2357400	2361400	I have shut down corporate mail servers thinking I was turning my laptop off for the night,
2361400	2364400	shut down dash R and out, why isn't my laptop going off?
2364400	2366400	I've done that, I did that once.
2366400	2369400	We had to call Ops and Boulder and have them restart it.
2369400	2376400	Obviously the way to route that you pay very, very close attention to your prompts
2376400	2380400	because all your prompts look the same in command line world.
2380400	2385400	The system that I'm working on locally is the one that I'm all paying up and it's all Tmuxed up.
2385400	2391400	I like to have a very distinct, separate terminal for any remote work
2391400	2398400	because unless I'm pulling content down, then I'm clearly doing a context switch.
2398400	2406400	I'm doing control tab to go between my two systems and I'm not at risk of doing that kind of screw up.
2406400	2409400	I actually do that same thing on stream.
2409400	2416400	I will have a terminal that is sometimes even a different application.
2416400	2418400	In my case, no terminal.
2418400	2421400	I'll use that transparently or whatever on stream.
2421400	2425400	Then I'll have another terminal, an alacrity terminal or something.
2425400	2430400	That will be where I do my private stuff where I'm working with schedules for my students and stuff.
2430400	2433400	That way I have that separation.
2433400	2439400	Over the years, I've just come to depend on that as kind of a safety net to not make that kind of mistake
2439400	2442400	because I work with thousands of systems.
2442400	2447400	On any given day, I could be connected to any system and a lot of times the systems were in the Fortune 500.
2447400	2453400	If I were to do something like that, it could have been much more serious.
2453400	2458400	As a professional, I just find it safer to have that separation.
2459400	2464400	In the worst case scenario, somebody has my same bindings on a remote system.
2464400	2470400	My Tmux would gobble it up and it would save me from doing something that would remind me that I'm on my local system.
2470400	2477400	I'm okay with that, but it's a solid argument against doing what I'm doing and to just use the default bindings.
2477400	2481400	But if you use the default bindings, it doesn't work.
2481400	2487400	Because if you use the default bindings for Tmux and now you're connected to a remote system, how is that any different?
2487400	2491400	The remote system has now gobbled up control A and control B.
2491400	2495400	So now you're using a local system with control B and a remote system with control B.
2495400	2498400	So either way, you'll have the problem.
2498400	2504400	At least if you set up one differently in your personal config from the default like I've done,
2504400	2510400	at least you can see that difference somewhat.
2510400	2518400	And frankly, that might make it safer for you to use your local Tmux sessions to connect to remote systems
2518400	2521400	rather than firing up a full separate terminal for me.
2521400	2529400	But I think it's important to remember to take stock of the fact that I'm talking about just opening one extra terminal, not 10.
2529400	2536400	And I've seen admins and people, in fact, I've seen streamers who fire up multiple terminals
2536400	2542400	and they're talking about the best desktop managers and they're debating about which one deals with terminals the best
2542400	2546400	and has managed like six or seven terminals all at the same time.
2546400	2547400	And I'm just shaking my head.
2547400	2552400	I'm like, guys, no, it's so much easier with Tmux.
2552400	2559400	Because not only is it wicked fast, I mean, the type of speed, I'm sorry.
2567400	2569400	All right.
2569400	2571400	So I'll just wrap up here.
2571400	2581400	So I was just going to say that you saw how fast it is to split those with Tmux.
2581400	2584400	I mean, there's really no comparison.
2584400	2587400	Oh, I think I just lost my stream.
2587400	2589400	I did.
2589400	2591400	So actually, here we go.
2591400	2595400	So let me go back here.
2595400	2598400	So you've seen how fast it is to just split the stream.
2598400	2606400	The amount of time it takes to split a pane is way faster than it takes to fire up a new terminal.
2606400	2610400	I mean, it's like ridiculously faster.
2610400	2615400	And so that's objectively better than having multiple terminals.
2615400	2617400	And that's all I'm going to say about that.
2617400	2619400	So a lot of people disagree with me.
2619400	2621400	They have to have different terminals or different whatever.
2621400	2623400	Lots and lots of need of them.
2623400	2626400	People like, oh, if a new of them lets you have multiple panes or multiple terminals,
2626400	2629400	like, okay, why would I ever do that?
2629400	2635400	I mean, I can open up a new pane and open a brand new version of VI in less than two seconds.
2635400	2640400	So anyway, and not to mention the fact that when you get all those hotkeys down for your new of them,
2640400	2643400	none of that's going to go with you to another machine.
2643400	2649400	Whereas if you have Tmux or screen on another machine, all those skills transfer.
2649400	2650400	So.
