1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Can anyone recognize that?

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
Can you recognize that?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:16,600
We do like a world's wall though of like things to look for on my back.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, you want to read the quote?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yep.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,640
Oh, Monty Python, you got it.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,960
The killer rabbit with sharp pointy things like this.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,000
Some call me Tim, Tim.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,120
When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be loud too, loud too, loud too.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,400
That's my wife's, what time is it?

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,320
It is, oh my God, we're late.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
We're late.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
We're kind of late.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,840
I need to start my pomo and all that jazz.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,840
Can I finish my coffee first?

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,340
How many have we got here?

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,340
I don't even know.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,360
I don't have my counters on the screen like I usually do.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,480
I am so discombobulated because I came back from that run.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,360
Also Hacker Music Yoga is on, I'm going to leave the music on for just a bit more.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,200
When the music goes off, that means we're actually down for Bidnath.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
We're going to get ready for Bidnath.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,680
But I'm going to keep my draw diagrams on there because I might be able to use that.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
What else?

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,640
I've got Anton running, I've got No Albs running, I've got the Discord running.

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,600
What else do I need?

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
Wait, wait.

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
Website.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,800
Okay, let me grab a new web window and put this over here so I can do stuff.

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,640
All right, boosters or whatever we're going to call you.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
I don't even know.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,360
RWXers, what should we call you?

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,000
What should we call you?

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,080
Okay, what's your name?

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:07,040
I don't like skill stackers, that's like weird too, there's like another thing.

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,160
We're on the same page.

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Boosties.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,800
That should be my swag.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,720
My swag should be boosties, manziers and boosties.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,000
You notice this channel's rated M, right?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,880
For the next four hours I'm going to be trying really, really hard to have you rated M, but

42
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,400
for the most part that mature rating is there for a reason.

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
You've been warned.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
You've been warned.

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,480
That's all I have to say about it.
