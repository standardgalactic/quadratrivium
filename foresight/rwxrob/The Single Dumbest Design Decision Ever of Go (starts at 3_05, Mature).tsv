800	2000	Sure, yes.
4640	5480	No.
7320	10240	My new favorite thing is get add-p
10240	12520	to individually add the chunks to a single commit
12520	14200	so they're all relevant.
14200	17960	It's so cool, built-in help documentation.
17960	19440	Don't you hate how when you print help,
19440	22200	you can't go to the section you wanna see of help?
22200	25600	Well, you can in Bonsai, at least by default.
25600	27120	And if you wanna, you can make your own help command.
27120	28640	You don't have to use mine.
28680	29520	So.
30920	34320	I already used generics a ton and I really love it.
34320	36880	This is probably the coolest thing right here.
36880	40480	This function right here could not be done without generics.
42040	43680	That's right.
43680	45760	It could not be done with interfaces.
45760	47320	It has to be done with generics.
47320	48280	There's no other way to do it.
48280	50280	And it's such a basic thing to have music.
50280	51960	A lot of people when they do coworking sessions,
51960	53600	they'll go, they'll stop talking
53600	56560	and they'll turn their music on, not me.
56600	58640	I am gonna be talking during that time
58640	60240	and turning the music off.
60240	62200	And in the reverse, when I take a break,
62200	64680	I'll put the music on and I may or may not be talking
64680	66760	during that time or walking away from the computer.
66760	67960	So that's how it works.
67960	72360	Create a file and directory name completer,
72360	75180	which is the default in most shell script applications,
75180	76880	which does completion.
76880	78200	But ours is gonna be better
78200	79720	because it's gonna allow you to do things
79720	83400	more precisely than the built-in default in most shells.
83400	84800	And let me tell you what I mean by that.
84840	86520	You run a tab your way through there
86520	87640	to get to what you want.
87640	90960	You recognize that you run out of tabs eventually
90960	94560	and it starts to default to showing you file system things,
94560	96920	even though the files are not valid arguments
96920	97920	at that point in the command.
97920	100840	And this is one of the greatest pet peeves of my existence.
100840	101680	I'm gonna banish that.
101680	104880	To make it so that every command in the sub tree,
104880	108360	in the bonsai sub tree has to be explicitly set.
108360	109760	There's no default completer.
109760	113000	If you don't set a completer, it won't complete.
113000	114080	It won't put something there,
114080	116600	but you can still have powerful completers if you want them.
116600	119400	This is one example of generics that we've been using.
120360	122440	I can show you that really quick, I think.
123800	127240	Filter, map, here we go.
128560	129720	So here it is.
129720	132400	You can't do this code without generics and go
132400	133960	and get good contact with my lips
133960	135880	before I take a drip out of it.
135880	139480	But if you're like at all lazy in your drinking habits,
139480	140440	which I am,
141280	145120	it'll all end up on your shirt
145120	147720	because it'll break the seal and then look it down.
151800	152640	That's cool.
152640	154160	During break, we need to look at that closer.
154160	155320	This is really cool.
156400	157560	It's what I've been telling people.
157560	159560	This is more important than your website.
160720	164800	Seriously, making a really strong GitHub landing page
164800	167640	is way more important than a website, in my opinion,
167640	168560	unless you're a web dev.
168560	169400	I love the skill stack stuff
169400	171960	and I found our old site,
171960	175600	www.artificerob.github.io slash vi-help.
175600	177120	This was, you can print it.
177120	178800	There's a PDF down here
178800	181840	and that has the cheat sheet that I used to print out
181840	183840	for people and have them put next to their monitor
183840	184800	so they could learn Vi.
184800	186200	It's about, it's available for free out there.
186200	187040	You can go download it.
187040	189880	I've just hit the single most annoying,
189880	193400	idiotic, moronic, stupid design decision
193400	196560	the Go team has ever made.
196560	197840	And I'm gonna rant about this.
197840	198680	It's gonna be a long one
198680	201680	because I am so pissed off that this exists.
201680	203960	This is so fucking stupid.
203960	204800	Watch.
204800	206120	Watch what this evaluates to.
206120	207320	This is the caller, right?
207320	209560	The caller has a value, it's an interface.
209560	212720	The caller is nil, right?
212720	214160	And here is what it contains.
214160	216160	That's the type of reference it is.
216160	219200	But here it says it's true.
219200	220040	Nil?
220040	220880	True.
220880	221720	Which one is it?
221720	222560	Who knows?
222560	225600	To the fact that if you involve an interface
225600	228920	which everybody tells you to do and go, do interfaces
228920	231920	as soon as you involve an interface, a simple check
231920	234520	against whether that thing has been defined
234520	237160	will return false.
237160	239000	So you can't tell whether it's nil
239000	242000	and your code that fuck up because of this.
242000	246760	The only way to fix this is to use fucking reflection.
246760	248520	This shitty ass reflection
248520	251480	in order to get the code to work correctly.
251480	253320	And I'll show you, I'll change this other line up here
253320	255240	so you can see the value that comes out of that.
255240	258000	Here's the code that works the way we want it to.
258000	261760	As you can see, it's not reflect value of is nil
261760	263320	and now it's false.
263320	267280	But we had to actually jump out of go and use reflection.
267280	269280	You might as well have used Python at that point
269280	272240	because we've incurred such a huge performance hit.
272240	274760	Not to mention how non idiomatic it is.
274760	277160	This kind of shit just really pisses me off
277160	280800	because there are probably thousands of people out there
280840	284840	using if interface that equals nil
284840	287760	and they are failing because it's not catching it.
287760	290080	It's fucking terrifying.
290080	292080	Watch out for this one.
292080	293920	I'll have to say using the length of arguments
293920	295760	as a check for an empty slice.
296760	298640	And that is a safe way to do it.
298640	299760	And I've been reminded today,
299760	301280	I was tempted to try to do args equals nil
301280	302640	and I got burned really bad by that
302640	305560	because args equals nil was false
306600	308240	even though it was zero condition
308240	310360	where we had an empty slice
312280	315720	and the equals nil did not pass.
315720	320480	So just to be safe, always check the length of arguments.
320480	322200	Then no matter what state the slices in,
322200	323880	you'll get what you expect.
323880	326240	Comparing against nil is always dangerous.
