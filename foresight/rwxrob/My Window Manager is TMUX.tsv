0	5300	One of the things I get asked all the time is what my window manager is I get that I don't know what this is about people
5300	9320	Obsessed about window managers and distros and stuff. It's fine. People are just making conversation
10160	12160	Rarely they're judging you based on your choices
12960	17240	to me it doesn't matter as my window manager is Tmux and
18480	21840	Do I use a status bar? I use my Tmux status bar
21920	27640	So as you can see right now everything that you see on the screen is Tmux. This is a full-screen
28120	35240	Nome terminal that came with pop OS is my distro and I have got a Tmux within a Tmux
35240	37240	So this stuff down here is all we chat
37640	42920	This down here is my status bar. This is a status update my pulmonary trauma on my Tmux configuration
42920	45360	Which we're going to be covering in other videos. So stay tuned
45920	47920	And then here's my title down here
48640	54400	You can't see it, but and then up here you can see this is this is up here. This is a Vim session
55120	58520	And up here you can see that I have another Tmux status bar
58520	63120	That's because I have a Tmux within a Tmux and stay tuned. I'll show you how to do that safely
64120	68840	So that you can actually have two status bars or you can split your screen and do all kinds of crazy amazing things with this
69280	71280	so by using
72400	76320	By what's that can use it to previous CPU usage and other things absolutely
76320	80840	I can do all of that from the command line if I wanted if I wanted to put CPU utilization or anything
80840	84320	I wanted to I could put it in my terminal in my in my in my
84400	88840	You know status bars of different types so I could put it up here or I could make a pain
88840	93800	I can do this so I can split a pain over here. So easily. I just split that pain in half
94040	97720	That's pain management. And then if I want a new window control C
98320	100320	Let me turn my eskies on so you can see everything
100720	106840	But as you can see I can go back and forth screen and tell it multiplexers I can split this guy some more
106840	109280	I can make T matrix here run
110160	117200	You know, I can put the fish in another terminal the point being that I have absolute immediate control
117760	124120	Over all of my windows and pains people continually say you need to learn I3 you're learning blah blah blah
124120	131280	I say no, I don't need any of that all I need is Tmux because Tmux gets you everything you need I
131880	136200	Do everything from the terminal anyway, so there's no need for me to do anything besides that
136680	142720	It does manage my windows it matters my real estate it manages my pains
142720	148360	It allows me to do I mean I can do H top over here if I want to have that thing sometimes in another window
148360	153920	I'll roll I'll run my other thing and and by the way all the bindings that I have here are also
154920	158120	Completely transferable, right? So it's like
159240	161240	configuration centralized and
162440	163880	Portable
163880	169240	In a single file, so you know your Tmux config if I'm doing like I don't know
169240	174680	I'm good planning on doing the Kubernetes certification and I know that they have Tmux so that odds are I can take my
174680	178880	Tmux com files stick it on the system along with my batch RC and my Vim are seeing I'm good to go
178880	185640	I don't care do it. Could I install I3 on there? No, could I you know change my Linux distro?
185680	189040	No, let's say that I want to just run a Docker container
189120	194520	So, you know, let's say I'm going to run it's like the fault Docker container Docker run it
194520	199680	You know, let's like run it a bunch of container, right dash dash RM and
200520	205520	Let's give it a name. Let's do Debian and what we should we call it?
207120	211320	What is it? How do you do names in I think it is something I don't remember so
211920	215760	Oh, fairly crazy because that shouldn't actually not found. Oh wait
216640	219800	I think it's dash and something so Debian
221160	227720	Is it dash T dash T is the name. I thought it was dash and is it dash T
232400	237320	What is it people I think it's dash dash and
238440	242280	Name I know there's a shortcut. Okay. So here we are on here, right?
242520	246440	So so now I can like I have my I have my host here and
247960	250120	It didn't seem to work. So we'll just go ahead and use this
250240	256240	So let's say I want to put my team looks config over here. I want to put my my team looks good thing. So Docker copy
258040	260040	This
260400	265480	Tmux comf and I want to put it on this. Yeah
266760	269520	I also structure. What am I talking about Docker copy?
270520	273640	Oh wait, where is my team looks file? Did I put it someplace else? Oh
274800	276800	there is
276840	280640	Tmux comf to am I doing it wrong? What am I doing wrong? I
282880	287320	Think I have to put slash there. Yeah, there we go. So now it's here
288120	292320	So over here. I don't have Tmux. So you have to update
294160	296160	Damn it have to update
297160	299160	a
299200	301200	app install
301520	303520	Tmux
303520	308000	Yes, I want to install Tmux. Let's see how fast this goes. I start Tmux over here and
308640	311760	It didn't pull up my my thing yet. So let's see if it's still there
312560	316840	Is it there? Yep, there it is. So where's my home directory root? Okay, here we go
317120	322840	move slash Tmux comf to dot and now Tmux. Oopsy
323400	325400	Get out of that Tmux
325640	327840	It should pick it up. It doesn't look like it is. I
328680	332680	Just not picking it up. Let me see if I can do it Tmux. Was it dash C? I
334040	336160	Got it. I don't remember what it is. I didn't plan this
337760	339760	So
339800	341800	We talking about oh, there's no man page
342840	344960	All right, so Tmux is it dash C
346840	352320	Dot Tmux com the point is you can use Tmux on it if I can't get it you can you get what I'm saying
352560	354560	This is file directory
356240	358520	We talking about oh, there we go
360520	365080	Set that show yeah, I know you didn't think you were gonna get to see me docker fail this whole time, did you?
365600	368520	No, since file directory what the oh wait?
370360	374920	Sashay, I don't know. I see it right there. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. I
376280	380120	Wanted to reload my Tmux and it's not loading it. Come on load my Tmux. Please load it
380620	381800	Uh
381800	386960	Okay, well it's loading something. It's loading something. I don't think that's the right thing
386960	393200	But it's loading something the point is you can take your configuration with you and and you can change it up and
393960	396400	And just copy between doctors containers and something that
397400	402320	I don't know here. Let's try this man Docker. Let's I don't I don't I don't have two minutes left
402320	406920	So let's try this man Tmux. Wait, we're gonna go into the Tmux conference after this. So
407840	411240	Man Tmux, let me go see if I can look up the comp
412960	417080	No dash C is a show command, of course silly me silly me
418920	420760	Where's the configuration file
420760	424160	By default Tmux was a configuration file from Etsy Tmux.com
424840	429160	It looks for a user configuration file at till the does that mean it because there's no user over here
429160	430160	Is that way?
430160	434600	Cuz cuz cuz it looks like there's one there. Okay, let's just add user
434920	440000	You you password you you
441120	442480	Yes
442480	444480	you you
444560	445720	Yes
445720	447720	All right as you dash you
448360	449960	copy
449960	451960	root dot Tmux dot
452760	454760	Comf to here
455280	457280	First denied
458560	462400	All right, well, let's try this schmocks schmod
463080	464840	Plus are
464840	468120	It doesn't have sudo built-in. I have to install sudo
468680	474000	Yeah, so that's why I'm doing it. I know this is what you get when you get bear bound container
474000	480400	I actually have configure containers, but you get the point cannot operate on a dangling sim link. How are you a sim link?
482680	484680	You're not a sim link
485000	487000	All right, fine
487720	489720	I'm gonna change this
489920	491280	Let's do this
491280	495360	Yep, let's just give me my copy. I'm gonna copy it to
495960	497160	slash
497160	499720	home slash you have it that and
501240	503440	Now we can do it exit Tmux
504480	507120	Damn it. Oh wait, let's do that you
508040	509560	Tmux
509560	515080	Still listen kidding it. I don't understand why make it make it go away. Wait did it?
515640	517640	Am I using the right Tmux file even?
518640	523960	You guys like it when I screw up anyway, don't you? I mean, that's your favorite thing to watch no vi I
526520	528600	Could use Ed's not even here is that out here. I
530760	532760	Think it is damn it
534400	536400	Damn not even Ed I
536960	538960	Didn't seem like it though. You saw that, right?
539960	543480	You did you see that? I did not seem like it. So apps
544600	546600	So then minimal
548320	550320	I don't need the rest
550760	553440	Is it Vim's tiny is it Vim tiny?
555840	559680	Yeah, that's it okay, I could remember the sim link came from the host
565080	567080	You
567280	569280	LS-J oh
570440	572080	You guys
572080	577980	Finally cracked it for me. I feel so silly of course it did
578800	583360	It's like trying to link to things that don't exist. I'm 14 seconds over. Can I do it?
583360	587280	Pomo just shut up for a second. Okay? Okay, Pomo. Thank you. All right, so
588480	595600	CD into dot files. All right, let's do this. So cop be good to the Tmux the Tmux
596320	598320	Uh
598680	603720	Doctor yeah, yeah, thank you. You guys cracked it. This is more fun that way when I screw up, right?
603720	610160	You can know the do the perils of using symbolic links. All right, so docker copy
610600	612600	dot Tmux dot com
613360	616480	To this thing whatever this is I
617920	621320	Didn't take my name because I got the command wrong because look I can't remember shit
621360	623340	That's just how I am. All right, so they went up
624760	631080	We do colon slash home slash you and I have a better feeling about this
631080	633080	I just do I just have a better feeling
633680	635080	LS-L
635080	638240	LS-LA. Oh god LS-L
641000	642480	Tmux
642480	647560	Huzzah, there's my Tmux that I know and love it's got my own things here
647560	655760	It's got all my bindings. It can turn my clock on. Where's the clock though? There's my refresh thingy. Anyway, as you can see
655760	662720	You get your Tmux and yes, I had problems because other reasons not because it was hard to get Tmux over there
663760	667480	So hopefully that's that's just helping that can make the case for you to consider
668520	670520	Using a window manager. That's just Tmux
670840	672240	and
672240	674440	You know, you can you can you can put it on anything
675120	682820	And put it on anything. So I'll let's just review configuration centralized and portable single file. You can put it on anything
685360	689360	Can be configured to behave
690480	694280	Like a screen which has come on every system since it's on a time
695440	698120	It's extremely powerful. I
698920	707560	Cannot even begin to tell you how powerful it is powerful and configurable even if you don't buy into the plug-in stuff, which I don't I
709520	714000	Avoid plug-ins because the plug-ins defeat the whole purpose of having a
717120	722520	Because no longer portable, right if you but you can use them right no longer portable
723160	726080	But I personally don't like them. I try to stick with the basics
727000	730400	And it's you know, it's universally available
732320	734320	So even
735080	737080	During certification exams
737600	740640	so, you know, if you're working through a web browser and
741080	747600	You can't see what you're working on and you haven't you having to fight with the web browser already because you're doing a certification test
747600	751400	It's a terminal-based thing and you're already using some sort of stupid ass web
752120	754520	Emulation, you know, if you got too much in there
754520	760880	It just makes it that much less painful because you can split the screen up and stuff like that rather than to do whatever
760880	765040	I can't even imagine what you would do which is a single terminal if you can't if you can't split the screen
765040	766920	You got to do two things at one time and you want to check
766920	771480	Maybe you want your documentation open in one window, which you can you can do or you want a man page
771480	774400	You're gonna be able to something like that, you know, then yeah, you need this
774400	780720	You're gonna open up multiple windows, you know web web terminal tabs in order to check out your different things
780720	787080	So there's just a million reasons to make Tmux the only window manager that you care about and
787400	794160	I cannot overemphasize that we're gonna still talk about how to configure Tmux thing and all that and I'll move on to different videos
794160	799760	About that, but this was supposed to be sort of a seamless demo of why you might want to use the team at the Tmux
800080	804800	Moon image or I have to do is watch me or anybody who uses one for a short amount of time to
805040	807800	really get a sense of why you might want to pick it up and
808320	814360	I mean you can use it to make your own sort of monitoring station if you're a kubernetes person
814360	819040	And we did I did this at work the other day where we had a bunch of things that we're watching at CD health checks
819120	825960	We had some pings running in other windows and it was all in this beautiful big split-screen console with no annoying borders in between
825960	829120	Other than like the one, you know terminal border in between the whole thing
829120	833800	so that's my that's my argument for using Tmux give it a shot and
834360	837800	We're gonna proceed with some other videos about configuration and stuff like that
838840	842480	We're gonna talk about oh persistent sessions, right? I forgot about that
843480	847080	So Tmux also allows you to have a persistent session
848920	853360	I'm gonna do a different video about persistent sessions though. So watch for that
