{"text": " That's some good stuff. Hey there. Welcome to the stream today. I'm gonna do a little stream about which editor you should use first for coding and this is because I have been trying to make the decision about what editor to use on the stream as I go forward with the rest of the beginner boots and I think it's a big big topic. I've never covered it before. I've covered little pieces of it all over the place but I've never tackled the topic at large. It's a huge topic. So before I even let the crew of hecklers and debaters and you know outlying intelligent people to come on here and like make all their cases for whatever thing they use, I just wanted to talk to you for a second about you making your own decision about what to use and God knows I'm a very opinionated guy and I have a lot of specific opinions about this but I wanted to just go ahead and run it all by you. First of all though, let me just make one change. There we go. Much better. Cheers. A little bit of spike coffee there to get me through this. Actually chai. The topic of the topic of an editor is a really controversial topic. Everybody argues about it all the time. Everybody's right. Everybody's wrong and the bottom line is that it comes down to what is the best tool for you and so today we're going to talk about three specific types of editors, types of tools that you can use for editing code. A lot of these editors you could use just to edit whatever you wanted to and they file into three categories IDEs where they call individual development environments, lightweight graphic editors, and terminal based editors that you know what if you know me at all you know terminal editing is my preference but I want to talk about all of them so that you can kind of speak intelligently about which one is the best to use for a particular task and if you're if you're watching this video live stream right now you're probably gonna see a graphic for a while but some of there's gonna be other graphics inserted in here to talk about this. So the first editor I wanted to talk about is one called Visual Studio and we're gonna we can go ahead and look at where to get this and everything. So Visual Studio, let me just put my thing back on. Visual Studio is the default for most C++ development on Windows and from Microsoft and you just do the search for Visual Studio you'll find it. It's really important that you understand that Visual Studio is not Visual Studio code and we're gonna talk about that that's what that gets under the lightweight category. This is a great tool for what it's designed to do which is largely work on very big Microsoft applications and some people swear by it and they use it all the time. I hate it. I've had to use it on occasion and it's a fun fact there's there's somebody who did some analysis on it from Microsoft who discovered that something like 50,000 lines of code are never even used in the codebase. It's the epitome of Microsoft bloat but it is a mandatory tool if you're going to be doing anything in C sharp or C++ for Windows. It's just it's just really not worth trying to do it in any other way. You certainly can use other editors for that but that it's really not it's really not worth attempting that and so that's one of your choices. If you attend if you're going to be doing Unity development or you've been doing something C sharp you might want to pick this editor if you can use that. There's another popular editor that's been around for a long time by the way Visual Studio has been around forever. Another editor that's been around for a while is called JetBrains it's actually so much an editor as it is a company. IntelliJ is there JetBrains has become famous for specifically their IntelliJ editor which has been around since the 90s. It's a really good one but this is you know this is your decision whether you want to use this or not. Personally if they have they have they I think they're the ones who did PyCharm. This is a little bit lighter than traditional you know integrated development environment than some of the other ones that are out there but it is it is a thing that you can use and you can give it some some consideration. There's Python developers who absolutely swear by PyCharm. I would never ever use it but you know that might be you. I want to say there's there's another one in that branch that's called GoLand which is the other thing too is you get language specific ID's yeah there we go. GoLand is the JetBrains ID. This is one I've heard rave reviews on. Petit Jolliway check really loves it. One of the most famous converts from Node to Go. He uses it. He was raving about it. A lot of people really like it. It's got great theming and everything and frankly if you're going to be developing in a specific language in fact somebody who recently got a job with a company that does go development they this is their go-to editor. It's not mandated but it's really encouraged that you use it. I have been to be a fan of the idea of having if you're going to have a graphic editor that you have a graphic editor that's highly customized for your whatever it is that you're developing and so this would be one you might consider if you're going to do go development. PyCharm is that way and frankly JetBrains as a company has made kind of a business out of creating editors for specific languages the first being IntelliJ which they was a worldwide hit. I believe IntelliJ then went on to become the standard native application development tool for Android and you know with 39% of all internet traffic going to Android phones with Chrome now that's a significant choice. So if you're going to pick an editor you might want to consider JetBrains for that. There's one that I have to mention that I absolutely despise mostly because I had to use it. I was forced to use it. This we got really popular. It's called Eclipse and there would be groans in the audience if they could if they could if they could hear that you could hear them right now. Eclipse is probably one of the most notoriously bloated and horrible integrated development environments on the planet as far as I'm concerned. However it is everywhere. There's an Eclipse foundation and there's I mean it's been everywhere since the 90s because Eclipse got really popular because it was really the first substantial Java editor written in Java and Eclipse itself has gone on to be embedded in applications because of its framework. IBM for example same time their chat client is an entire Eclipse instance with Java built in. It's one of the most bloated pieces of crap I've ever used and not just that but Lotus was the same way and you see a lot of things around that still use Eclipse for lots of reasons then you're likely to encounter it if you're doing any Java development and particularly even in Minecraft if you're doing Minecraft development. If I had a choice and I was going to be doing Java development which I would never choose to do I would you know I would probably be reaching for IntelliJ over Eclipse but again you might not have that choice and Eclipse is super famous for having all the things integrated into it and it's really popular with enterprises. So they've developed a lot of enterprise tools that use it and a lot of times I'll mandate that use it. When I was at IBM I had to use Eclipse and I figured out ways to get around that and use VI under the hood so that I could just use Eclipse for the things that Eclipse had to be used for for like committing code into the source tree and stuff like that. So again we that's those are the those are the only individual development environments I'm going to cover just to give you an introduction to them so you know about them. This is you know beginner boost material here so I'm assuming that you don't know anything about editors and maybe you've heard somebody say you need to learn this and you need to know this and hopefully this will help you make your own decision. The next category of editors is actually the lightweight text editors. There was something of a revolution started by Sublime and it was the first so I talked about this before I'm doing it again though because I feel like it's important to do it in a more succinct way. So Sublime text is still I believe the fastest visual lightweight editor in class. There's still people who really love it but it has fallen out of favor for two well three main reasons the first main reason is that it's highly proprietary. You can use it but you're supposed to buy it. Number two you can't extend it and there's there's almost like yelling at each other flame wars in in the support forums because the person who maintains it which I shall not name can't doesn't listen to anybody does whatever he wants and and and the people who are trying to expand it and do their own thing just can't and they're just so frustrated that this project this part of this product which was so great is just completely not available to anybody to extend or use. Now you can write Python plugins and things like that. A lot of people do that. And the third thing the fourth thing is it's it's all Python. It's Python and C and so extending it is is you know even if you could it would be really tough to do it. I think it's C++ actually but fastest editor on the planet for a very long time in the graphics category you know short of like really simple ones and we'll get to those two. This is a little bit across between you know the whatever the editor is on your computer and I don't need to tell you that about you know notepad or simple text or whatever the editor is it comes on your computer just a plain old text editor which by the way Jennifer recommends in learning web design you just use that and that's actually how I learned web design in like what 95 or so I actually coded my first HTML using simple text on a Mac and that's totally fine. It didn't have any syntax highlighting you know as a whole world opening up to me after that point so don't feel bad if that's all you know and then if you have if you have pop OS or Linux of any kind that the built-in graphic editor is pretty dang good the text editor so we're going to stick with those are all lightweight but that's really ultra lightweight right so in between ultra lightweight which is just text editing and nothing to do with code and the big fat behemoth IDEs you have these light this lightweight brand of editor called Sublime Text which is the first one and I'm very gonna quickly gonna go through the history of that so after Sublime Text came out and had its problems that I mentioned people ran to Adam and Adam was that it was was GitHub's answer to Sublime it was an editor developed by GitHub before they were consumed by Microsoft and it was designed entirely to use JavaScript in fact the entire Electron API which people love the bag on now because it is responsible for Eclipse Slack God how many more I mean there's so many applications that have Electron built into them now and Electron is the framework that was built to build out of them primarily oh boy what did I just search for Electron so so we have Electron here I probably should say engine or something no which I say framework Electron gets a really bad black eye these days because so many people make very simple applications that have an entire Electron you know framework built into them Electron just wondering is the combination of the Chrome web browser and some a web server that by default I think is node and and the stuff to talk between the two so it's basically like you have a little miniature web server and web browser all built into one and that way you don't you know it's it's kind of like a web application so so you'll get you're gonna hear a lot more about Electron I actually have done a video on Electron if you can go search up on my YouTube but it's important you understand that Electron was created to make Adam and as soon as Electron came up you know everyone's like well maybe we can do better so and it was JavaScript it was really slow compared to Sublime it's still slow compared to Sublime but Adam was really lighter than the IDEs and it was extensively using JavaScript which made it really popular with a lot of people really fast it's still really popular actually and and then you have brackets so so brackets was Adobe Adobe's answer to this they said hey we want to make one and I'm almost positive that it's running off the Electron editor but the Electron framework but I can't confirm that right now and it basically the same idea it's just Adobe style different approach you know Adobe I guess wanted to do their own for some reason I've never met anybody who uses brackets who's not a big die-hard Adobe fanatic and you know what I'm talking about they are there but that exists and so that's one of the one of those and then sometime after that Microsoft decided to get into the game and they said you know what let's make code visual studio code VS code so that's code.mic let's see code.visualstudio I think it is yeah code.visualstudio.com now this you know they could they had an opportunity to really clean things up but they did it and they named it visual studio code instead of visual studio and this has created crazy confusion for beginners I don't know how many times somebody's downloaded visual studio instead of visual studio code because the icons are similar they wanted to just carry on their branding and maybe you know make people think that visual studio is actually not the horrible bloated piece of crap that it is and so they you know they added code in the front of it and it's really tough but just make sure you go to code.visualstudio this is the number one editor on the planet right now hands down by every measure this is what most code is being written in Microsoft does know developers and they they're pretty good at making editors and so they released they did a lot of things that weren't very Microsofty at the time fact you could argue that this was the beginning of the new Microsoft under Sanjay that you know really really embraces open source and as far as we know and they released this to the world and said here's our version and we're using Electron and ours is faster than Adam and we still use some techniques that are the same they have their own plugin architecture which is very very rich right now and people go crazy over this thing there's people who love completion I despise that and there's you know it's just really popular with a lot of people this is the editor that I usually have beginners use so if you're just coming to the booths for the first time and you've never done any editing and you don't particularly want to you know rack your brain learning a more difficult editor that I'm going to talk about in a second this is the editor that I recommend you pull out either this one or Adam chances are the VS code is going to be more fun for you out of the gate one of the things that VS code does very very well as it integrates with with other services that github now I mean that Microsoft now owns Microsoft bought github and at that meant that they also bought the Adam editor it's open source but you know and they bought control of this code and they got all the 10 million developers just so that we're you know committing to get him all the time and that's very good 7.8 billion dollars they paid I believe and that's a very controversial decision and that's that was that was after Git lab came out but I'm going down kind of a rabbit hole there but just understand that this is still under Microsoft's control the future looks pretty bright for Visual Studio code because Microsoft does control it other than the fact that they're probably going to blow it out like they do everything else it it it is integrated very tightly with with github which is the world's leading source repository even though it's not my favorite and that's a depth separate conversation I use Git lab for everything and so that's I'm going to kind of conclude on that except but one other thing Visual Studio code has Microsoft's limitry that's embedded in it that you have to actively go in and find and turn off and nobody does by default so I can't recommend an off that you at least give VS code in the try VS code him and you can go find it it's actually if you're using pop a West like me you can just search for it and it'll it'll you know it this is what it looks like it's exactly the same we're not gonna run it right now but so so that's what we're looking at and you can download VS code him all this podium is it's exactly the same project thank God for open source right it is VS code in every way it's just had all of the telemetry the tracking and privacy violation and stuff that it is activated by default in Microsoft's tool there are some things that don't work in it I've heard but for the most part I think you're gonna be fine to use this I have not well other than the other day I haven't given a lot of work but I have used this code for more than a year and a half at one point I was a total convert to VS code and I actually gave up my favorite editor of all time them for VS code for a good year and a half and I did a video on that ultimately though I concluded that even a lightweight text editor for me is is just too heavy and too slow and and people take great exception with that but but I am not a graphic editor I never have been because the terminal is always going to be faster I can I could argue all day that the terminal on every level is faster than any graphic application period just from the trips that you have to make over to the mouse all the time and however to use a terminal editor today is is you know it's a craft you have to like practice it just like the piano or something you can't just jump in and use it it's pretty hard so let's shift our gears now to the terminal editors and I want to talk about those and a little bit of the history of the terminal editors this is that the terminal editors are my favorite and after that year of VS code it was my own people then my own community reminded me to that that it was still faster to start up files and everything with vi and and I it is it's just better so based on that we're going to go back and I'm going to pull up the chat I'm sure we're going to have all kinds of people in the chat talking right now but before we do that I just wanted to tell you about them I think I can probably go pull up so that I have to give you a quick history on the editors here so this let me go back to the title screen for sec alright so so when it comes to when it comes to terminal editors you have to go back into the history of terminal editor and know what a terminal is first of all a terminal is the thing that you get when you fire up I'm firing up one right now so you guys can see so this is a terminal editor and I'm going to show you this actually give me a second I'm going to make it a big screen when it changes one to be so that it hides stuff and I'm going to go into preferences at the thing about terminals is that you can set their colors and everything and I just just want to set that to something that's very readable for right now instead of the transparency just so you can read it I mean I love transparency don't get me wrong but it's a little hard to read sometime all right so so we'll do that and then we'll bring this guy make this thing full screen alright so actually yeah let's do that so if I bring you back if I bring us back to to here you see you just get a plain terminal there's nothing going on it's just a terminal and terminals can be really scary if you don't know about them you haven't used them before but they're very powerful and we're gonna talk about terminals at another time we're gonna talk not gonna talk about terminals right now but I did want to introduce you to different kinds of terminals so the first terminal is ed and it's actually you could argue that it was the first terminal ever made X I think predates it but and it is a line editor and I mean Ed like this Ed and it lets you like you can set in commands and those commands will it will adjust each line of a file that's coming in and I don't want to spend time with any of the editor showing you because I know it'll take too much time and but the second editor after Ed was it what editor called VI and VI stood for visual mode of X or Ed and so it was in the other one just allowed you to change one line at a time and and VI let you have like a whole screen and to just let you see what that looks like so I mean where are we right now we could probably do damp some md and you see you get you get this screen this is actually them and we're talking about that but you get the screen you can type stuff in here and save it and and such right and so that was visual mode we see how it took out the whole screen so via and actually there is another I don't think I have it installed but let me do this really quick install and VI and you got to do my password there and there we go we'll install this really fast our package is great package systems alright so so now I can do the same thing I can do and VI and this is this is NVI is the original VI there is no you can't get the original VI usually these days it's really hard to find unless you're using a really old computer most computers come with command call VI which is aliased to a modern version of it called them they VI improved but the original VI is is is represented in a program called NVI not to be confused with Neil them and we'll talk about them and you have them in a second so NVI is a want bug for bug compatible version of the original VI that came on Unix systems from the dawn of time and and it continues to be the default editor right here on BSD Unix which is a different you know kind of operating system we're talking about today but all this terminal stuff originated with Unix actually Minix and we can go back but for all intents and purposes Unix was the very first time and you know in college campuses this was sort of used and then Lennox came about this isn't a terminal history class right now but we'll talk about later so so this the question comes up well so what should I use should I use VI and you know or should I use them so the next generation of editors that came out after this was the thing called VIM and VIM is just improved VI and and and then to and it attempts to improve upon that yet another version of them came out called Neo VIM and rumor has it there's another one called space VIM now which I am not interested at all I'm not interested at all in the OVM and I actually strongly discourage you from using it for reasons that I can describe you think I can send you to my blog post about why you might not want to use it VIM however is my favorite and and because VIM gives you all the power of customization of your command line terminal and why would you use a terminal on the command line the single biggest answer to that is in the case of VI or VIM it's because you can fully integrate your computer's terminal power into your editor and while you can pull up a terminal in VS code that is not necessarily the case right you it's a lot harder to do you can do it but it's not as obvious so you know if you learn VI and you don't learn or VIM and you don't learn how to integrate the shell commands and be able to write really quick little shell scripts in order to do things or you don't learn how to use macros which I took a long time to do because I was a sort of a VI purist for a very long time you know you haven't really learned them and you're not gonna really understand a lot of its advantages you'll just be frustrated because you can't exit you can't escape which is you know big joke out there so but if you do allow yourself to do the things you can you you can make the most powerful editor you can imagine in fact when combined with a really amazing shell like bash and a multi a terminal multiplexer which allows you to split your screen up into pieces like Tmux you have what I believe is a far more powerful individual development environment with without the bloke it's the most efficient way to do editing of all time not only that but it works everywhere and so I before we go to the other terminal options I just want to say that VI is installed on every VR Vim is installed on every Unix and Linux system for the last like 50 years and so if you are going to be in a situation where you just need to attach to a cloud machine with you know headless that means it doesn't have a graphic user interface and you want to be able to apply what you're going to do there you you just want to learn them or VI and you just you just do because that way you can make it you can be effective anywhere if you're going to be a hacker you really need to learn VI if you're gonna be a hacker you need to learn Ed also because a lot of times when you break into a system you don't even have that big fancy screen all you have is one line at a time and that therefore Ed comes in really handy because Ed allows you to edit files there's other ways to edit files but but Ed that would that's a really strong case for you to learn Ed if you're just like wanting to be a web developer or you're wanting to just write you know some go-co for some reason or you know or for whatever you know edit pod files for Kubernetes or something that that is you know not necessarily a reason to learn Ed but VI doesn't hurt because it works everywhere but that brings us to the next option but speaking of defaults some time ago the Linux foundation and all the Linux people decided to get rid of VI as the default they didn't take VI off but they they stopped making VI the default editor and they started using something called Nano which I actually despise but I understand why people need to use it to get going the reason I despise this editor and you see me using my my my my my just you know like writing and then pushing backspace and stuff like that this this nano is by the way is an is a is a newer version of Pico which has been around for a while and these got really popular because they were used for mail processing back in the day when you would use a terminal for mail so people remember them and it is definitely more intuitive to a beginner but you really have to span the arrow keys you can't navigate around you can't really integrate your shell you sort of can and the most annoying thing of all here is that it encourages you to use control X to exit and and that just the the the see all these things down here that begin with a carrot those are all as you know control things and and I just I just really don't like the use of control characters but now I've been overruled everybody everybody on the planet thinks nano should be the default editor on Linux now and now now it is to be fair sometimes you would do something that was really important like you'd be editing you know a scheduler file and cron job and you would go to edit it and it would throw into vi and if you didn't know vi you were in trouble because now you couldn't exit you didn't know how to exit there's no help there's no menu you couldn't get out of it and that's like a long time you know joke in that in that world in the world of of vi so so that's why nano is there I can't in good conscious recommend nano if you're going to use a terminal because the whole reason for using the terminal is to make it take advantage of the terminal and its integration with the shell and so that brings us to yet another option which is very popular with with academics and and and hard hardcore coders and Linus Torvalds you made Linux and many many other really you know substantial developers and that's emacs and and I actually do not like emacs I I played around those emacs curious for a while the reason I'm gonna before I get into emacs I don't think I could operate it I don't even know if it's on here yeah let me check and see nope it's not even on here I have to install I that I'm not going to install I'm not gonna waste your time I would be totally lost using it some people swear by it people joke and say a max is in an editor it's an operating system and the reason for that is because emacs was developed primarily by a guy named amateur stallman who wrote most of the C code for the utilities that use along with Linux the GNU core utilities he's the guy who says you should call everything GNU Linux instead of Linux because he believes his contribution outweighed the Linux kernel itself as well as everybody else's contribution to the whole Linux system which I totally disagree with but but he you know made emacs and and emacs is still popular in most of all is using something called microlinux apparently and the the attraction from emacs is that it can be customized it's it's it's it's basically the heaviest possible terminal application you can run for editing anything and it's not just editing you can like change your file system you can they've got so many plugins to make it do so many different things they've even got stuff that makes it behave like vi if you want and and for some people they really love that you gotta understand that that was a thing when terminals were the only thing in the house emacs was like really powerful I mean it was really powerful back then there was no tmux you couldn't split panes up you had screen which allowed you to have different windows and cut and paste in text back and forth but but a tool like emacs at the time was I could see how it would be really compelling particularly because there wasn't no network yet so you know even before networking existed emacs existed right so but nowadays when we pick a terminal editor I believe you're picking a terminal editor because you want to be fast you want to integrate the shell commands and you want to be able to use your editor anywhere as fast as possible you don't want to wait up for things to start up and and by the way that means that you can't take your big fancy emacs configuration with you you've got to know how to be how to edit files on remote systems without all that it doesn't take very much to copy over that to a system but you might not even have permissions to do that in certain enterprise environments you have to have a change ticket to do that and so that's my my take on it becoming proficient with vi first and then vim allowing yourself to use the extra vimisms which I finally gave in on allows you to be you know have the the efficiencies of of emacs locally but and you know and build it and basically an IDE by combining bash you know vim and and you know tmux but it also allows you to be to use the same fingers and operations you know think muscle memory on any system anywhere and emacs doesn't allow that you'd have to install it as you just saw on all those systems to be able to use it so so I believe that's a big strike against emacs for anyone who wants to use more than one computer if you're gonna spend what you're just do it you're an astrophysicist you're gonna just work on one computer the whole time and you want to be able to write your own plugins and everything and all this stuff and then you max might be might be your option there and and by the way another reason to use vi is because the bindings for vi are built into everything so the use of hjknl for navigating through the history is the thing right and by default the the terminal and Linux is set to back to emacs mode so it's as if you're interacting with an emacs session but if you do set that show vi you can use that you can use vi mode there is no nano mode or anything like that and you'll come to really appreciate that because your fingers will memorize things from the terminal that carry over into your editor and that didn't goes into like terminal terminal browsing like when I when I browse you know when I browse the website I'm using one hand and I'm using the same vi navigation keys because those are once again you know built-in and it's very common to encounter you know terminal software that has Vim bindings you can even do a thing called Vim Vimium which can work in Chrome as a program plugin allow you to navigate your graphics browser without touching your mouse at all you can just stay there and do vi sorts of things I'm sure similar things exist in to for the emacs kind of people but as I've said from the beginning you know there's different stages here and if you're just starting out and you don't know what to use and you don't want to use text edit anymore you know the first pick I would say it'd be VS code it's very intuitive it uses the mouse you it's what you see is what you get but if you want to you know move into the terminal you're eventually going to have to move into the terminal just there's just not very much not even in the web development front-end world there's not very much that doesn't force you at some point to go on to a terminal to do something and I'm not going to go into all those reasons you would have to use a terminal but these days using a terminal is sort of mandatory skill for a technologist and the particularly in the cloud environment and because it's just ubiquitous it's just everywhere it gives you so much power and so if that is true you know and you have to use it you might as well I think you might as well learn the best editor for the terminal on any terminal so that you can be productive no matter what and if you want to take it up a notch and use emacs some people use emacs and vi there's a couple of really great BSD people in here who use they'll use emacs and they'll also you vi depending on what system they're on and that's only two terminal editors to learn that's not too bad in a way you're going to be able to do a VS code on that by the way just just say no to all of the remote editing crap that's coming out in VS code and all these graphic editors that are claiming to be able to integrate remote file editing what they're doing is under the hood they're copying down a file copy allowing you to edit it and then they're synchronizing up that copy to the server there's so many things that can go wrong with that I just can't even begin to comprehend all the possible things that could go wrong with that and if you are in charge of editing files on a remote system first of all why are you doing that right you should be staging it if you are somehow doing that one of the legitimate reasons to be doing that would be responding to an emergency as I did many times you know working as a system administrator and when you have to remotely connect to a system and edit files there the last thing you want in the way is a visual editor that's run by Microsoft I mean that I can't even begin to imagine the terror of trying to be a system administrator and do that so you know just if you're if that's where you're headed in cybersecurity and say in the system of engineering and even you know full-stack development as opposed to just running engineering then I would eventually move off of this code you can still use it you know if you want to do you know big web projects it's really good for that but if you if you're gonna start you know getting serious about development see see development is pretty much all on the command line that's kind of the culture you can do it in BS code but you know using make files all this stuff you're gonna need to learn the terminal so I would say you know probably 70 to 80% of all the careers in technology involve the terminal and of those careers you know probably 50 of those percent of those careers involve using a terminal on multiple computers without having an editor installed on them that you would stall and therefore my justification is learn Vi and then learn them and if you want to do that I will do videos on how to do that how to learn Vi a little bit of a spoiler here though if you want to just jump right in with Vi you can actually go read the little guide I made called Vi Survive so you can go rwx.gg slash Vi Survive and this is just the minimum you need to know to get around to Vi and this does or VIM and this does make use of the arrow keys because if you're using nano and you want to get started with Vi and not start with nano this is the way to do it this is the way to do it rwx.gg slash Vi Survive and that I'll talk you through how to how to just you know use Vi as if it were nano and then you can slowly add on more skills that's how Vi learning works I'll do the different videos on Vi specifically as part of the terminal mastery series but I just wanted to do this one on editing all right so that concludes this video I'm going to turn and take some comments I'm sure I'm sure that I'm sure the forums are full of the comments are full of people raging about different things that I've said here and as I've said all along be your own person be a critical thinker do your own analysis for your own needs and make your own decision don't take my word for it don't take their word for it don't let any pedantic argumentative jerk decide for you what's best for you and that includes me because I can be that guy so you make your own decision but taking a bunch of information make an informed dependence and be ready to change your opinion when you have new opinions when you have new information but don't don't let anyone shame you because you're using the wrong editor and by the way if I ever do that I'm always joking right I do I have fun we all have fun but but and that's that's fine that's the part of natural natural healthy debate but but you know just take that with a great assault when we do that I'm gonna turn to the chat now at at potentially what will be my peril so I'm gonna put that on here so here we go Pico Pico came with pine oh yeah Pico was a pine pine was a male editor no nano yeah I made a thing about nano you max always makes me picture emack Mendy the people the problem with emacs is the same as the clips people are already making emacs based applications are they really didn't know that when I browse the lips that I'm using one hand yeah I know that sounds pretty funny doesn't PG just quoting I walk into those things all the time obviously I didn't mean it I'm browsing a text-based website so yeah text oh you're the vimeo you're thinking you're talking about vimeo okay why don't you know them neo van is a disaster that never needed to be made and and has been completely superseded by all of the additions that been made and I'm gonna just if you want to get my my full story on them let me just on on Neil them I can give that to you here so if you go to no pet or noob G Vim I'm not a fan of graphics Vim although somebody informed me the other day that you can interact with the shell using graphics G Vim but to me that defeats the whole entire purpose of using them at all if you're using Vim you want to integrate the shell and if you're using Vim on Windows with no bash shell I think it's a waste so I don't that's not the way God intended it to be used this put it that way many have keyboard shortcuts yes have Vim shortcuts yes I like using a terminal but never really use terminal editors for anything other than reading manual pages well that's not an editor in the first place you're not you're not you're not using an editor to read a man page you're using a pager they're like less or more I think remote editing is sometimes used for working on a machine that is much more powerful for huge coach bases with specialized hardware I could see that right that might be that may be fine that might be an use case for that otherwise not a fan of that pretty calm here yeah are there good resources for learning V of them but the sounds of it you can't just dive in there are many and if you I've listed them on RWX I haven't been to a whole thing on that RWX slash I want to say tools editor Vim I don't remember let me go check here let me see here can't find them there we go editors VIM go VIMisms so there's your there's your link well I'll just do this RWX dot gg tools editors and I have a number of things you can use there the VIM tutor is probably the best even though it's out of date I I would never use anything but the VIM that that is managed by the original creator of VIM one of the complaints against VIM the reason you know VIM was created is they the two biggest complaints against it were it was not it was not conducive to community development which I believe is BS and number two that they didn't have concurrency and that was immediately fixed so if anything good came out of Neil Vim it was the pressure for for Brom to add that and and he did and I believe something as important as VIM needs to be managed by one person or two and that's it I've seen committees destroy applications and and I've actually put my advice about not using Neil Vim out there in fact I could probably find that for you right now the biggest one is all the things they just ripped out without even asking anybody there's like a tons of changes that they made they didn't even ask anybody and but they made it so you can use plugins with node I mean all the technical and architectural decisions behind Neil Vim are almost one after the other a testament to horrible technical design and architecture and I just I cannot overstate that I hate it I hate it I just I really hate it it's just really bad hi I can't I'm in the middle of us of an actual educational video but I'll be right there I'll be right there okay so so that's my my complaint against Neil Vim if you want to know and so alright what else we got here a new follower here hey how's it going whatever can I use if I have to develop on a remote computer like a Linux cloud machine vi the end I just made a case for that use vi or VIM that's why you should learn it uh-huh and the way to learn that is use VIM tutor if you want to you can use eventually you can use VIM genius online there's open I think it's open VIM which is another one then we kind of get you started on that there's a number of them they're all listed on my on the VIM editors H URL that I posted when it comes to graphical editors I always have no pad plus plus besides the other more powerful ones it is just the fastest graphical one yeah I agree I mean no pad plus plus is really great it I I still think no pod no pad plus plus I didn't mention at all no pad plus plus fits between no pad and sublime I believe it is really fast but it you know and it is graphical it's very intuitive because you're just using your mouse and it's got a little bit of more umph in it besides the plain old no pad particularly it understands utfa you know that that's a thing so so that's you know you might want to might want to give that one a try to I know people that still love no pad plus plus and and I use it for a while a long time ago but I'm I'm pretty much a if I have to use a Windows machine and that would be the thing but these days Linux is so prevalent on on Windows that I got you know a Linux terminal at my fingertips I don't I don't need to use any any you know Windows only kind of editor for any reason did I miss the 2020 dumpster yeah it's gone what we'll do that again I'm glad it was a hit which one yeah and so yeah thanks for the direct the the 2020 dumpster we'll come and do that again I am gonna wrap up the stream for right now thanks for participating in our little dialogue about this if you have any specific questions that you know you you want to go into ask them in the discord you can ask me directly if I'm available but but you know we have a whole discord just for this kind of thing asking questions getting getting in there but I really really felt like I needed to go break this down because for the rest of or Vim Neo Vim and Vim plug-in will be a support I felt like how you do when you and then came out I'm seeing more and more and then plugins these days yeah no they stink if you're first of all okay I'm glad you brought that up if you are searching to use a Vim that allows a lot of plugins if you're picking a Vim editor because of it uses more plugins or because it's prettier you're picking it for the wrong reason you might as well just use VS code or a graphic editor at that point and I strongly believe in that if you're seeking to use to do plugins instead of integrating shell scripts you're not doing it right in my opinion you're doing it wrong you look if you're gonna reach for a plugin at least before you reach a plugin learn how to use vi properly if you don't know how to if you don't know how to use exclamation point and vi and if you don't know what I'm talking about it's just making my point you don't know how to use vi on Vim you're not in a position to make a decision about stop using it because it doesn't have plugins and and you need to practice doing the standard way of using Vim integration into the shell before you start punting and looking for every plugin under the sun and for and picking a tool that will allow you to plug in to make a plugin in 50 different languages sometimes specificity is the thing sometimes you don't want 50 options sometimes you don't want to have a configuration file in 20 different formats sometimes you want limitations on your types sometimes you want strict typing so all of those architectural principles apply to Vim you don't want too much choice you want the right choice and that's why Python won over Pearl because it was one best way right so my biggest complaint against Neo Vim is this idea that we should expand the crap out of it and put whatever we want in and and rip up rip out stuff that's been there for years and it's not just because I'm an old guy it's because the entire approach is broken the entire architectural mindset of the Neo Vim team is just totally bored and and I that's that's my opinion on that I if you disagree that's fine go use it and have fun there's lots of really respectable awesome people who disagree with me very strongly primegian comes to mind big and bot comes to mind I'm not these these are great people and great human beings I love them I'm really glad that I get to be count myself among the streamers with them but there is no way I will ever be okay with Neo Vim unless I'm presented with new information that that contradicts what I've just told you what I see them doing is bloating the crap out of them in ways that are unnecessary and defeat the purpose for them in the first place the reason that you're picking them in the first place above all is ubiquity you want to use VI everywhere you might be able to go here and use it in fact I feel guilty using some of my vimisms but I'm okay with it and by that argument you can almost say well fine I'm going to use all the plugins I can I'm going to let myself go crazy as long as I remember the fundamental navigation elements of VI and stuff so that I'm effective on an AIX machine or a Solaris machine or anything else that I had to administer while I was being paid to administer machines and those jobs still exist so my point is that if you know before you give in to the to the tendency to expand and bloat your stuff out for questionable reasons at least consider using what's already there and that includes learning shell integration when you learn shell integration with the exclamation point I call it VI magic here go read this rwxigg vi magic will teach you what I'm talking about the specific thing when you understand how to use true vi magic then you're in a position to say well this plugin covers something I don't have I want the groove box thing I want whatever you know I do have plugins I do I use plugins but but I'm very picky about the plugins because they have to be downloaded on every system I'm going to use them on you need to make really sure that you're using a plugin manager that can be turned off or disabled if there's if the if the plugin manager is not on the system and all of those are things that that are not an option for new of him if you use a new of him specific configuration you've just blown away your ability to use that configuration on any remote system by default you better have a damn good reason to do that if you picked them because you want to be able to use it on multiple systems and I don't think there's ever a decent enough reason for that vim however is everywhere so you can actually port your you can scp in one command your vmrc over to any other system use that edit your files over there without a problem if you've used neo vmisms in your vmrc and haven't done it properly you've just blown away your ability to customize any remote system on the fly because you cannot install neo vm on that cloud machine without approval from your higher ups that for another change ticket just say no to neo vm i'm telling you say no vim is the is the standard editor for this kind of thing uh and if you do go with neo vm be damn sure you know what you're doing make sure you know how you use the shell make sure you know that those plugins need to be encapsulated in some vmrc uh code that keeps them from being unusable on a remote system and if you don't know how if you know anything about what i just said you have no business using neo vm but the reason i get so spun up about this is because they hear from somebody on some switch stream or somewhere that they should just go through that on they end up throwing it on and they destroy their ability to be to be a performant you know administrator and developer on a remote system because they somebody told them neo vm was the thing that they should use i spoke in my piece i think it's probably enough for me i think the plugins are an interesting aspect of how vim is growing over the years i agree i agree and i'm not and plug is amazing right uh plug is um i mean plug the plug is the plug i i i wish that the native plugins within vim uh were good enough but they're not and the plug plug in manager is amazing it keeps all your plugins in a separate directory uh if you look at my vmrc by the way i'll send that to you guys if you want to see it uh it's in rwx.gg uh i'm sorry it's uh it's in my git lab so just go to artybex live uh artybex rob.live and click on github or git lab you can go to my dot files and you can go find my vmrc if you want to spelunk it and by the way it is very common it's a common rite of passage to to steal somebody else's vmrc and and to just use it and understand it but make sure you go through the lines and get a sense of what it's doing because everybody's is highly customized and it's actually it's kind of a rite of passage to be a terminal user to do that uh along with you know understanding your own bash rc uh not to mention a full-time hobby just playing with your configuration i i cannot get enough of of of that i constantly love tweaking my terminal config it's it's really fun i enjoy that more than messing with my operating system uh people ask me all the time well what manager you're using i have window managers and goes whatever one is going to get me tmux because i don't care about the window manager i have a pain so there'll be other videos on that i have already done some videos about it but i'll be redoing them um these videos are all going to be edited polished and you know scrubbed and put up on vimeo for subscription if you'd like uh but the raw youtube video that i just made here will will remain standing for as long as youtube allows it to stay here and i really appreciate you guys coming by and spending some time here and uh i'm going to go ahead and i think we made that through that pretty well didn't we guys we didn't argue too much by i'm going to come back in uh 10 20 minutes and we're going to do some more web development so", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.48, "text": " That's some good stuff.", "tokens": [50364, 663,
