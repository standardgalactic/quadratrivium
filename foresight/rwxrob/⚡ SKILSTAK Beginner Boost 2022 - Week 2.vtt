00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Can anyone recognize that?

00:07.600 --> 00:08.600
Can you recognize that?

00:08.600 --> 00:16.600
We do like a world's wall though of like things to look for on my back.

00:16.600 --> 00:22.000
Oh, you want to read the quote?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
Yep.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.640
Oh, Monty Python, you got it.

00:26.640 --> 00:33.960
The killer rabbit with sharp pointy things like this.

00:33.960 --> 00:40.000
Some call me Tim, Tim.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.120
When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be loud too, loud too, loud too.

00:50.120 --> 00:54.400
That's my wife's, what time is it?

00:54.400 --> 00:56.320
It is, oh my God, we're late.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
We're late.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.320
We're kind of late.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.840
I need to start my pomo and all that jazz.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.840
Can I finish my coffee first?

01:02.840 --> 01:04.340
How many have we got here?

01:04.340 --> 01:05.340
I don't even know.

01:05.340 --> 01:09.360
I don't have my counters on the screen like I usually do.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.480
I am so discombobulated because I came back from that run.

01:13.480 --> 01:19.360
Also Hacker Music Yoga is on, I'm going to leave the music on for just a bit more.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.200
When the music goes off, that means we're actually down for Bidnath.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.080
We're going to get ready for Bidnath.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.680
But I'm going to keep my draw diagrams on there because I might be able to use that.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.680
What else?

01:30.680 --> 01:36.640
I've got Anton running, I've got No Albs running, I've got the Discord running.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.600
What else do I need?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.920
Wait, wait.

01:41.920 --> 01:42.920
Website.

01:42.920 --> 01:48.800
Okay, let me grab a new web window and put this over here so I can do stuff.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.640
All right, boosters or whatever we're going to call you.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
I don't even know.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.360
RWXers, what should we call you?

01:54.360 --> 01:56.000
What should we call you?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.080
Okay, what's your name?

01:59.080 --> 02:07.040
I don't like skill stackers, that's like weird too, there's like another thing.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.160
We're on the same page.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.160
Boosties.

02:10.160 --> 02:16.800
That should be my swag.

02:16.800 --> 02:24.720
My swag should be boosties, manziers and boosties.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.000
You notice this channel's rated M, right?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.880
For the next four hours I'm going to be trying really, really hard to have you rated M, but

02:30.880 --> 02:34.400
for the most part that mature rating is there for a reason.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
You've been warned.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.400
You've been warned.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.480
That's all I have to say about it.
