1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
So where did SteelStock beginner boosts go?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,600
That was the thing we were doing to get started.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,840
The quick answer is it got moved.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
And it was still gonna start something on May the 4th,

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,840
but so the overall focus is now gonna be on, you know,

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,200
content that, in fact, let me see

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,880
if I can go find my whiteboard here.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,280
Here we go, Unix infrastructure engineer.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,960
So it's gonna be called the Unix beginner boost

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,000
probably next year, but there's a good chance

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm gonna change the name of all of those boosts

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,520
to match the name to the books that I'm writing

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,560
that I'm starting to write right now

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,440
and I'm obsessed with writing.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,000
So the first book we're gonna write is

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
Mastering Terminal Velocity,

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,080
Mastering the Fastest Human-Commuter Interface,

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,840
which has everything from the beginner boosts

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,640
and you've probably seen me writing on it every day.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,880
You can go look it up actually at github.com

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,640
slash, I mean, Rob, slash book.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
And I've already covered this,

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,040
but you can go watch another video on this.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,080
And we're gonna go back to this kind of thing.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,120
And so that's what's happened to the boost, it's changed.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,200
So most of the people that are interested in this

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
are interested in the Go coding

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,240
that they were learning at the boost.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,760
We already decided a couple of weeks ago

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,200
that the Go coding in the boost is too hard for beginners

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,560
so who don't know how to code.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,680
So we assume that you have had some Python

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,120
as your first language and or hopefully something else.

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,240
I mean, Python's a great first language for coders.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,160
I mean, everybody knows this,

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,680
even I might not be my favorite,

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,400
but it doesn't matter, it's still the best one.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,560
So my, if you're wondering what to do with the boost

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,280
and now all the rest of the content

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
from the beginner boost,

41
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,840
the terminal related stuff is covered.

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,800
I mean, we covered it all.

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,160
The only other things from previous years

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,200
that I covered in the boost,

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,640
skill stack related things were things like,

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,080
how to get ready for a job

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,040
and how to put yourself out there and stuff.

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,760
But mostly the beginner boost has always been about

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,480
becoming, mastering the terminal.

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,080
And that has got really clear boundaries now

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,640
so that we have boosts for everything

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,000
so we don't have this overlap.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,640
So, this is my last take on what you should probably learn

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,200
in that way, what order.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,440
And you can go look at this up.

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,440
This is in my bout or you can just come ask me.

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,200
And so you go with the Unix beginner boost,

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,160
which is pretty much just the terminal

59
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,240
and then becoming a pressure technology professional,

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,520
which is all the stuff related to how to get a job

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,000
and network and all that stuff.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,680
That needs to be its own series.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,440
And frankly, it needs to be its own book.

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,600
I don't know if that'll be the name,

65
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,640
but that'll be it.

66
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,800
And so I'm really emphasizing strongly

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,440
that there will be books created

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,600
to go with each of these boosts.

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
And so the first one I'm really obsessed with

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,080
and that's what I'm gonna be writing all day today

71
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,080
is gonna be the keg ML parsers

72
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,880
so that we can start writing the book

73
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
and publishing it and getting as close

74
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,600
as we can to publishing the terminal velocity book.

75
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,480
And when I say publish, I mean really publish.

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
I mean paper version, no starch press,

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,440
Amazon all that.

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,800
And I talk about that in another question.

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,680
So if you wanna know what to do,

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,520
if you're like, what happened to skill stack boosts?

81
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
I don't know what to do now.

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Go learn Python.

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
There are so many ways to learn Python.

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,720
I just found a new book about how to learn Python,

85
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,520
which I'll talk about in another time.

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,440
It's really good actually.

87
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,320
There's a number of really, really great resources

88
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,480
for learning Python.

89
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,560
I don't need to cover that at all.

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
It's completely covered by the industry.

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,800
Learning the terminal is not.

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,760
So I'm gonna focus on the things that need help.

93
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,200
Learning go as a beginner is not covered very much.

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,120
There is a little bit of it.

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,520
There's learning go, which assumes that you know

96
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,080
how to code already and know a little bit of go,

97
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,160
but it doesn't, you know, and it's a good resource.

98
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,560
It is, it's a pretty damn good resource.

99
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,200
So I'm gonna let people go to that

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,440
if they wanna learn that.

101
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,320
And the people that have been with me on the boost

102
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,520
on Saturdays since we started doing co-programming

103
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
are wanting to learn go.

104
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,540
So there's gonna be tons of go programming,

105
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,260
but from now until January,

106
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,300
because I'm writing the parser and then, you know,

107
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,620
all this stuff for keg, and that's all gonna be in go.

108
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,820
So if you already know how to program

109
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,820
and you want to increase your go skills,

110
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,420
you can still come in and check in at boost time

111
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,940
and you'll be seeing me writing

112
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,540
and mostly coding in go, right?

113
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,220
We're gonna be doing a lot of Kubernetes stuff as well,

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,460
but that's generally during the week,

115
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,960
not necessarily on Saturdays.

116
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,940
So I do plan on keeping Saturday

117
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,020
dedicated to writing, you know, keg-related go code

118
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,020
and potentially, you know, a book related to go of my own,

119
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,540
but that's secondary to getting

120
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,900
the terminal velocity book done.

121
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,620
And then, so that's pretty much it.

122
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,460
That's what's happened.

123
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,740
If you wanna know what to do next,

124
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,500
you know, learn how to write your first program in Python,

125
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,380
go programming fundamentals.

126
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,580
At the same time, you can also learn

127
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,060
how to create containers, OCI containers,

128
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,260
you know, with PODMAT or Docker,

129
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,320
learn how to run local Kubernetes.

130
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,100
You could probably also learn

131
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,260
how to build your own desktop PC,

132
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,700
set up a Linux server.

133
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,460
This is also stuff that we're doing differently.

134
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,460
So the boost is not going to be the same next year.

135
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
So I'm just gonna say it right now.

136
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,100
So we still will have the tradition of starting something,

137
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,100
probably the terminal velocity boost on May the 4th.

138
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,900
But it's not gonna be called beginner boost anymore.

139
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,460
It's gonna be called whatever

140
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,020
should match the book title that it goes with.

141
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,460
And I won't be having any boost

142
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,780
that does not have a book written for it already.

143
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,340
So this is just something I'm really seriously going

144
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,620
to force myself to do over the next year.

145
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,980
I mean, I change my mind all the time,

146
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,620
but that is something that has plagued me

147
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,140
since the beginning because I am kind of loosey-goosey

148
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,980
in how I do it.

149
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,180
I know what my outline is and everything,

150
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,060
but there's nothing to show for it

151
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,340
after that other than the videos.

152
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,180
And then people are like,

153
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,020
well, how do I get through the videos?

154
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,100
And they have a rough outline.

155
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,220
If they have a book to go through,

156
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,500
like an actual book that I can update week to week

157
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,820
if I have to, and that's why I'm so interested in Keg

158
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,180
because Keg will allow that

159
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,580
other than printing something that's out of date next week.

160
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,340
Keg will allow me to have people

161
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,780
get the latest version of the book every week if they want

162
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,500
and contribute and add whatever.

163
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,380
So that is gonna happen.

164
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,380
And then, so the most likely possibility for next year

165
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,080
on May the 4th will be a link to this map.

166
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,100
Yeah, I have links to all the maps in my description.

167
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,740
At least I will.

168
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,200
If I don't have it yet, I will get you,

169
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,060
I'll get all of this stuff.

170
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,500
This stuff is all kind of like my free form thinking

171
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
about different things.

172
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,020
And there's no way to link to all of my stuff.

173
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,260
So I will be making a resource

174
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,100
to link to these different whiteboards

175
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,940
that I have, I have a lot of them.

176
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,460
And the whiteboards are gonna be based on

177
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,700
general topics and stuff like that.

178
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,300
The Home Lab and then it's another thing to do.

179
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,820
So what's happened to the beginner boost in a nutshell

180
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,660
is that it's gotten more specific

181
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,820
and it's kind of fractured into a lot

182
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,140
of other specific things

183
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,180
for which there will always be a book, a guide

184
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,140
or some publication from now on.

185
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,700
So I know that sounds ambitious for me to do that,

186
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,580
but I've always wanted to do this and it's time to do it.

187
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,220
And keg needs to be built.

188
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,140
It's actually more important

189
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,700
than even covering a boost every year

190
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,940
is making sure I get keg finished

191
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,220
so people can start building the knowledge exchange

192
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,260
or the keg network of, you know,

193
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,600
and share their knowledge and stuff like that.

194
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,260
So this, when we do it next year,

195
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,820
it'll be probably called the terminal velocity boost

196
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,060
and which is fine, you know, terminal velocity boost

197
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,980
and it will be like, what is that about?

198
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,500
And it'll be getting you fast on the terminal.

199
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,460
It will not include installing Linux at all.

200
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,500
It will include using bash as fast as possible.

201
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,940
And then there will be different boosts

202
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,100
if you wanna call them that or sessions or series

203
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,180
or whatever about how to get Unix.

204
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,220
And I'm talking about Unix, not just the center of Linux.

205
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,660
If you, you know, we're gonna go through, you know,

206
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,180
we'll have multiple series, you know, segments

207
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,580
about how to get Linux.

208
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,060
Because there's just, I mean, how to get Unix.

209
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,140
There's so many different ways to do Unix.

210
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,940
And in fact, I've always wanted to cover those things,

211
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,660
including, you know, installing on hardware,

212
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,500
which we can cover now

213
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,260
because I have a capture card that'll do it.

214
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,620
And again, those are all topics

215
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,620
that are covered a lot elsewhere.

216
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,020
What's not covered is, again,

217
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,740
the very specific thing about how to get fast

218
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,860
with the terminal.

219
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,900
And so that's my number one priority,

220
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,420
finish that book first and do the rest.

221
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,700
So the content from the boost is still there.

222
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,620
And the go programming, if that's what you want,

223
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,180
or, you know, the terminal stuff.

224
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,060
This isn't gonna be writing the book every day

225
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,180
or something about the book.

226
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,540
You'll be able to get that any time.

227
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,460
And then you can always go back to the videos.

228
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,380
And then what will end up happening

229
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,460
is the videos that go with for the boost

230
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,740
will get more and more polished every year.

231
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,580
And they'll become more segmented.

232
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,820
And eventually, probably,

233
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,540
they'll turn into Udemy courses,

234
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,740
which will be an option.

235
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,900
You won't have to do Udemy.

236
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,660
But if you want to do Udemy, you can.

237
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,700
Otherwise, you can, like, slog through the unedited video

238
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,940
that I used to make the Udemy stuff.

239
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,980
And there'll be a book that goes with it.

240
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Okay, so that's what we are looking at.

241
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,940
All right.
