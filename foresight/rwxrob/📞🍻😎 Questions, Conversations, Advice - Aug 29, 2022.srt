1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay, start. There we go. So we're now recording it. We're in dark mode today

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,920
Mostly because it's a total disaster in my room right now. But as you can see, there is a server taking form

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,360
It's coming alive

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,040
my server and I've actually got another playlist on YouTube called home lab in it

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,440
and

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,280
It will be

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,300
About how to set up your own home lab or how I set up my home lab

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,280
and

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know how or when I'll be recording that but we're gonna come to them

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,040
So the first question that is everybody still talking about so I'm gonna talk about it is

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,700
Did you buy all Raspberry Pi's in the world for your rig?

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,000
And you can't see it but like right up here on the top there's a 16 by cost me 250 dollars by the way

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,600
Yeah, 250 dollars to get an aluminum Raspberry Pi

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Hot swappable

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,120
to you

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,440
rack

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,440
shelf and

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, and I'm gonna be putting that there

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,760
For that if I know I didn't I actually have 30 or so Raspberry Pi's. I mean I keep finding them everywhere

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,040
I need to remind everybody I used to run a company. I founded a company called skill stack in 2013 where I was you know

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,440
Mentoring people in person at a school. I lived in a town home above it and the bottom floor was

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,600
Just lab in school. You can go to twitter.com slash skill stack SK

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,880
I'll

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,280
SDAK if you want to see pictures of it from from back in the day and maybe I need to show you that really quick

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Because I want to

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,520
All right, so to our studio audience who can't you're an audio only I'm going to twitter.com and

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,160
I am pulling up some

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,640
nostalgic photos from skill stack my

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Once popular

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Place and this is where I have my curriculum and there's like pictures and all sorts of things and if you go to actually if you

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,360
Go to Instagram

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,080
You'll see some stuff. The question is about Raspberry Pi and that's what I wanted to show you

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,720
So actually Instagram is a little bit more fun

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
if you go to instagram

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
comm slash skill stack you'll see

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,720
Videos and stuff that I've done and including

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,560
So this is the there's my red rack behind me right behind my head

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,920
That used to be my really really really really cheap. I mean look at how ugly it is, but you got to understand

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
I ran my own company. I kept my costs really low

40
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,360
And so I didn't have a proper rack. I do now because I work for a

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,560
Big-ass company and I make a really cushy salary. So I've been dropping, you know, like $300 on to you Raspberry Pi

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
Thanks, but this this is like the thing so all these little green lights out the bottom by the way

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Or I have 19 Mac minis that are installed

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Which make really really great?

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,880
Cloud home lab kind of things. This is me organizing

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,240
That was when I had to move skill stack into my apartment to my house that I rented for two years

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,760
And then we moved here and so now as you know the ongoing saga. We're going to be moving within a year

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,960
To some other location. We don't even know where

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,280
To do my wife's MFA and we'll take a Raspberry Pi's with this

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,840
But no, we did not buy all the Raspberry Pi's, but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from. Oh, this is a great

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,560
This was a game camp. This was this guy this guy made his own like

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
amazing thing

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,300
We don't know where we're going so this is the game camp this was a summer camp that we had and that was my workstation at the time

54
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,060
But I'm just showing you this we had like lightsaber camp

55
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,940
It kind of stuck hot damn these kids are so young all these kids are in college now

56
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,860
They're all in college now. Oh, I just found the box with lightsabers

57
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,580
Yeah, I found the box of lightsabers

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,660
This guy like distro hopped like ten times in like a week amazing student

59
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,340
anyway, so

60
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,660
We don't know. I don't think it's gonna be Wyoming. No, I don't know where

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,740
So but this is where the Raspberry Pi's came from so everybody's wondering where they came from

62
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
I know I'm not buying them up

63
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,700
They're leftovers. In fact, so where them people like why do you have all this apple?

64
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,700
I mean, there you go. This is what I wanted to show you

65
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
This is Raspberry Pi camp

66
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Check that out. Check that crap out

67
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,300
He wrote that from scratch. He did it on himself the entire requirements

68
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,020
Look at this one, man

69
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,620
The requirements for this Raspberry Pi in case you can't see it the requirements for this Raspberry Pi class was just to like

70
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,660
make one of the things was blank and

71
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,820
He just he just kind of kept experimenting and putting wires everywhere and trying everything out

72
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,740
And he didn't make in his own full-blown like microcontroller extension

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,660
And I was like, oh my gosh, this is what happens by the way when you give

74
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,300
people

75
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Freedom to be creative in their learning

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,320
Yeah, and so that's where the Raspberry Pi's came from so I have about 30

77
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,800
I have a sort of robot. This is the old this is the old apartment where I used to live

78
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Before I got kicked out of that

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,960
You give them the freedom and they'll that okay. Here's another here's Sean. This is this was a this was us getting hacked

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,040
We we put a cloud server up

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
We put up a cloud server

82
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,000
This is security camp and we put a cloud server up and this is

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,480
The cloud server got hacked within a day during the camp during the week on camp. We said how long will it take somebody to hack us?

84
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,280
right and we were learning like all of these different commands and

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,480
his cloud server got hacked his his honeypot got hacked within a day and

86
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,880
And we were sitting there watching all the stuff it was doing and we were doing s trace

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,160
This is s trace. This is s trace on the the process that had hacked us

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,860
And so we could like see what the with the malware was doing and track it down and stuff. It's really really fun

89
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,160
Anyway, good times

90
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,720
No, he got we wanted to get hacked the people who got hacked first

91
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,020
They was like fishing like we were fishing. So if you got hacked first, you're one of the lucky ones

92
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,000
That means you got a bite. So he got a bot. He got a bite on the first day

93
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,080
And somebody hacked his closet. The whole point was to show how quickly

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
Unprotected did you see that royal typewriter right there by the way?

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,880
Yeah, that real typewriter is was part of I just spilled my coffee on myself

96
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,080
That's why I have a towel right here to protect myself from this kind of like mishap

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,000
Because I'm an idiot and it's also really dark. My coffee cup is brown

98
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,320
Hmm, I think I might have to add more vodka to it. I'm sure that was not a contributing factor

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,760
Are we still having fun master shells Matt you want in okay, here you come

100
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,520
You're gonna give me crap. I know but I'm used to it

101
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
All right, wait, wait, wait, give me a second

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,640
Hey Rob, hi, how are you doing? Audio is a little bit messed up. Let me fix the audio here my audio

103
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Problem with my device

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,280
Anyway, so yeah, we did a lot of stuff there, but that's where the Raspberry Pi came from and I promise you

105
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,640
Uh, this whole open source contributed some coffee to the salt. No, thank God my map my laptop's closed

106
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,640
Yeah, so it wasn't it was only half full the guy or half empty whichever way you want to look at it

107
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,120
Hmm, and there's my old IP numbers. Anyway

108
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,760
Do I need to add that to the list so I have to answer that right now I

109
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,160
Mean I'm gonna add it to the list. Let's do that. I'll add that one right now answer that for you right now. Yes

110
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Yes, I do

111
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Anybody seen triumph of the nerds

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,360
If you haven't seen triumph of the nerds, then you don't understand what a compliment it is to call me a nerd

113
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
So go watch it

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,880
seriously

115
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,040
Seriously, if you have not watched triumph of the nerds, you need to

116
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,760
All right triumph of the nerds

117
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,160
Videos, I think it's out there for free. There it is

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,840
Excuse me 1996 documentary triumph of the nerds

119
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,200
it's like a three-part documentary that goes through the creation of

120
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,440
nerddom and

121
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,840
if you really want to understand the origin of personal computing and the internet there was a

122
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,040
Triumph of the nerds to the car. No, it was like two point two point one

123
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,120
I think and that was how the internet got made and

124
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,360
I think it's Bob cringely is the guy who did it the same guy who famously did the interview with Steve Jobs

125
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,960
Which they found old footage of which resurfaced near the end there

126
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,400
There's two point. Oh, if you want to get a real solid handle on

127
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,680
Technology history the most significant me can read the innovators, which is like a 300 400 page book or you can go

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Watch triumph of the nerd. So if you haven't seen it cue it up. It's amazing. It's really fun

129
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,400
It's it's it's from a different time

130
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,200
Interestingly enough the guy who did this the guy who did this actually lived in Steve Jobs neighborhood

131
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
He worked for Apple computer when it was in a garage

132
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,720
And then and then it became so much more. So

133
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,280
I'll just tell you about that. So absolutely. I'm a nerd

134
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,280
But the real question is are you a nerd or a geek and if you haven't seen that nerd or a geek back when you could actually watch

135
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,880
When you could watch Rhett and link Rhett and link have completely sold out. They're just grifters now I

136
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,320
Used to really love Rhett and link. This was eight years ago

137
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:05,080
But if you haven't seen the epic rap battle of nerd versus geek which I cannot show here because we're doing you know a thing on YouTube

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
Make sure you watch it

139
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,040
If you don't know the difference between a need and a Gurt egg, did I say a neek a

140
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,040
Geek is like we I'm not gonna tell you what they are. You need to watch Rhett and link have this nice fight

141
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,880
It's really it's a really great rap battle. I think you'll really enjoy it

142
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
So they are definitely different

143
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,200
But

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,400
Like play it like ten times and slow it down and like listen to what they say

145
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,720
Because it it pretty much perfectly captures the difference between a geek and an earth

146
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,280
So that's that what this is a question

147
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,520
What's your favorite tech art anything related to goes logo? I

148
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Really really really do like goes logo

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,160
those of you who know René René French

150
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,560
and

151
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,320
is is Rob Pike's wife and

152
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,160
The gopher is was designed by René French

153
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,360
Who has done many other things as well?

154
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,840
And

155
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
You could go you can go look at them

156
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
And and see about them

157
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,360
We can look at some of the different images here. So here is all of the thing

158
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,000
I really like I mean is is in fact René friend having been involved with artists a lot gone to a lot of art galleries

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,720
You can watch it in my rl streams on twitch some of which have been saved. I spoke coffee on myself as well. Well

160
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,320
My wife my René French actually reminds me of my wife a little bit. She's got that whole art look going on and

161
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,680
She's like really talented and you know, she's

162
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,400
She wearing Rob Pike's glasses there that looks like

163
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,680
It looks like she's wearing Rob Pike's glasses right there

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,440
That's her favorite glasses issue. It's like they're wearing the same glasses or something Rob Pike would usually wear glasses like that

165
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
So Rob Pike you made Go Lang

166
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,760
One of the primary contributors to go Lang is made this this is like one of the very firsts to go Lang

167
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,040
I absolutely love love love the artwork behind go Lang. It's probably one of my favorite

168
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:22,360
The I mean as opposed to for example, like the logo for Java, which you know was never any good

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Where's the little guy? There he is

170
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,040
Duke the Duke logo, you know, I'm just not impressed. It was fine. It was okay. It was the 1990s

171
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,440
In terms of art and tech I do think they go well together. I

172
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,200
Actually made the logo for Tomel

173
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,640
I made it. I created it. I committed it. This is my logo

174
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,520
True story you can actually go look at the commit if you go look at the commit on the GitHub, you'll see that I made it

175
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
It was actually a joke

176
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,840
It was kind of a joke I made a pull request I

177
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,400
Made it seriously. I made her pull request

178
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,440
You want to see it? You want it? This is my like my one of my few claims to fame

179
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,440
I had to put it in a question for him in my stats of the ways

180
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Yeah

181
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Did you make the Tomel logo and the answer is yes, I did it's a very small claim to fame

182
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,480
But if you go to github.com slash Tomel

183
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,960
I also got Tom to kind of like pick up the pace

184
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,400
I was kind of on him because I was making a thing called file system as a database

185
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
which I still want to do with YAML this time and

186
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
I

187
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
Actually made Tomel Tomel spec

188
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,320
To oopsie to try to get people to look it up again. It's not there anymore. Damn it. I wonder if it's on github at all

189
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,520
It's a long time ago

190
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,160
This is it's interesting because I had no idea about anything on Rust and I actually burnt sushi for example one of the

191
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,500
The the pran the moderator and also one of the primary contributors to a lot of the Tomel parsing

192
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,060
He wrote Burt's issue made one of the part when they want it made the Tomel parser. That's really popular for us

193
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,300
He also resigned very very publicly and famously

194
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,820
From the Rust project over quote and I quote you can go read the PR

195
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,420
Hypocrisy among the Rust leadership

196
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,500
You can go read it if you want to read the whole drama and so actually funny because I kind of you know

197
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,380
Rub shoulders them a little bit while I was doing some of the Tomel parsing actually helped Tom Paletier

198
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,860
Do some of the that the Tomel parser with some of the test code for Tom for for

199
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,180
There's been super Susie's Tomel and again back then

200
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,220
I was thinking that Tomel was the one true way to create a file system as a database

201
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
We just have a directory and you put a Tomel file in there

202
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,020
Recursively and you end up with kind of a flat file database that's structured. I still want to do something with that with yaml cherry and I

203
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:03,360
Remember Ramirez. I forget her his or her name their name in the chat. We were talking about that the other day

204
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,100
And something I'd still like to go but some polities

205
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,500
Plenty is actually Tom Palletier is like one of the coolest people I have ever worked with an open source

206
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,380
and

207
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,460
because

208
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,060
Tom actually it's like, you know what I've always wanted to write a parser

209
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,380
I'm gonna write one and I'm gonna write it for Tomel and I think it's the I think it's better than Burt's issues

210
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,940
But whatever

211
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,500
And so actually evaluated it and this actually got me into writing my own parsers

212
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,820
So there's a lot of parsers out there. There's a lot of people who like obsess about this kind of stuff

213
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,860
So you can go out there and work with them. I do have some commits on here somewhere

214
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,140
Maybe my contributions are not that big big enough to site. I mean, I actually made a separate

215
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:51,580
Thing for the test code so it might be a separate repo that I did and I can't remember where it is

216
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,560
Anyway, but yeah, let me show you that actual official commit to them

217
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
to the Tomel project

218
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,820
Tomel laying the Tomel. Yeah, there it is

219
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,980
There it is there's my one commit to the Tomel project and

220
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,820
You can actually find it if you try to go I can't even remember where

221
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,100
Bob T logo, I mean, how would I put this I go through issues or code for requests

222
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,540
I'm just showing off at this point. What kind of show is this?

223
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,180
but

224
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,900
I'm super proud of it. So there so let's go search for logo

225
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,140
Alt Tomel logo change log Tomel has a logo. There we go

226
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,000
What changes that was this one oh

227
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,500
That wasn't me no, where is it Tomel has a logo. Oh, they put it in the change log

228
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,060
Yeah, Tom Tom approved my pull request that that was the that was the thing I wanted to show you actually prove my

229
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,940
My poor cause I was like super happy Tom made get him by the way like made it

230
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,620
He also made gravator

231
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,060
So he's a big deal over in Silicon Valley. He's also does his own thing these days

232
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,420
You can read all of his there's some recent drama with somebody who worked with him on Twitter

233
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,940
but whatever and

234
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,980
Regiment js. Yeah, he's been a lot stuff. He's he's he's great

235
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,420
and

236
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,700
You know see all results I get a

237
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,740
No, I where's my local commit. I'm gonna have to I want to find it. I hope they didn't delete it

238
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
That was like that's like my

239
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,380
My one small thing

240
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,660
I don't even think I'm gonna register as a contributor because I was like my only contribution to the whole project ever and it was kind of a joke

241
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,580
Seriously, it was a joke. I was like here. Okay. I'm gonna have to find it because it's a fun joke

242
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
Is it logos?

243
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,460
Yeah, is it? All right. Let me go find it. I

244
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,980
Don't know if that's gonna know damn it. Of course. I have to do like Maine or whatever

245
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,980
I

246
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,220
Help me help me Obi-Wan Kenobi logos. Okay. This is yeah

247
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,380
sink get attributes for Tom all Tom on PNG six years ago

248
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
What?

249
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,100
Uh history let's go look at the history added logos. Yay me

250
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
I'm in a contribution

251
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,700
Seriously, you know the feeling the first time you get one of your I don't care how sick I mean, you know

252
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,820
Chris know this committing to the Linux kernel and I'm like making logos for Tom

253
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,540
Same things. I mean in terms of like sick, you know, happiness, you know, so I like yeah, I did this added logo files

254
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,140
Seriously, it was like it was like 1 a.m. Some night and I was like, you know what?

255
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,020
Obviously everything is like everything is just a square bracket

256
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,780
So let's just do this and then the PR is something. Where's the PR history?

257
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,460
Where is this actually say the does it actually say it? Where's the PR?

258
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,660
I don't I don't know get as well as I should I kind of do but not as well as I should

259
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:08,420
I'm trying to look for the commit history because it said it said, you know, I won't care if you don't commit it

260
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
It's just kind of fun

261
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,300
Yeah, I don't I don't see like it's my comic got squashed or something. I

262
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,700
Oh, I don't I don't I don't see it anymore. Let me see. Where's it? You know the feeling?

263
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,780
Yeah

264
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,420
Yeah, well

265
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,600
So whatever, I mean Mike I did make a the PR wait pull request. Maybe it's in there. Oh, maybe it's in here

266
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
It's close. It's it's close

267
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,020
It's closed or an extra on

268
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,020
Damn Rob

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Damn

270
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,960
There's no record how far back to have to go

271
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:02,440
Can have equals lost of I know I do feel lost. I mean how far back to have to go can I can I can I do a search?

272
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Logo oh

273
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,800
There it is took a shot at logos. Yeah, my feelings won't be hurt if rejected figured what the hell

274
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,840
That was so much fun

275
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,000
I seriously it was like, you know, it was late at night. I'm like, what the hell? Let's just try this

276
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,240
So because I was trying to get it to pick up steam. I actually created tumble dash spec

277
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Which I think didn't get picked up. I mean, but anyway, I really like it because now they use it for everything

278
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,760
It's like all over now. You can go on the internet and search for tumble logos and I made it

279
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,240
It's like my logo everywhere

280
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So there are rust people

281
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,280
Every time a rust comes out and the rest people come out to me like yelling me. Okay, but but but I made the Tomo logo

282
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,920
Because you know rust uses Tomo. I mean rust can the rust contributors are like Bert Zushi in the gang

283
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,560
I mean, they were like fundamental to the creation of Tomo and making sure it became cool and all

284
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,680
There's many other cooler logos than mine, but it was just a shot at it. Look. Oh my god. It's even on Wikipedia

285
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
My logo is on Wikipedia. I

286
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,120
Can't stop. I just can't stop

287
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,160
This is saying anything about the logo who made a logo

288
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,400
To verbose that's true. That's why I don't use it. I use YAML these days

289
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,400
It doesn't say anything about the history of the logo. I should like make a Wikipedia edit

290
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Where did the logo come from?

291
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,720
Rob was bored on one random night. I know I should like edit it and add it. I should say I made the Tomo logo

292
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,960
So, I mean, it's a small thing

293
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,480
But it's the small thing. I should I do it right right now. I have to don't have the login or something

294
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,040
Where should I put it? Where should I put it if I'm gonna do this?

295
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,520
Shit, I'm scared. You're scaring me

296
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
I need to put like

297
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,320
Criticism, it's like just criticism. Holy cow. Why don't we have history and then it's like the logo

298
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,760
I'm kind of nervous because I don't do Wikipedia ever

299
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Example criticism see also external links at it

300
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm used to I I set up a Wikipedia

301
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:32,000
Site for IBM when I was on my team there and now I feel like I don't know what I'm doing

302
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,120
So it's probably not the thing to do during our Q&A session, but I don't have to come back

303
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,520
I'll have to come back and add it. I tell it

304
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,520
I'll put it I'll report a request to that to the community if there's anybody in the community

305
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,880
Who actually knows how to do Wikipedia edits and has an account and has done so like reliably go go go add that

306
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
I made the logo

307
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
Put that on my tombstone made the Tomo logo

308
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,200
When I die

309
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
My greatest accomplishment

310
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,680
Your email or something, you know, okay, not now, but maybe maybe someday

311
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,920
I do need however to bookmark this. I put that in my little cast then. Yeah

312
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Zett create

313
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
just a reminder I

314
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:28,960
Create the Tomo logo. How do we get in this? I don't remember how we got we got an art. We got an art. That was it. Yeah, I

315
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,360
I

316
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Did I made all the skill stack art?

317
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,560
I made the van art

318
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
oops wrong thing and

319
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,600
Stuff

320
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,680
So I actually love graphic design. I

321
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,480
Don't spend nearly enough time doing it. I made like the can logo and some stuff

322
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,880
I really really love graphic design. I particularly grab, you know, like icons and stuff like that

323
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,880
That's something I really enjoy doing. I think it's a drafter in me

324
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,320
I used to do a lot of drafting and map making for Dungeons and Dragons and stuff like that

325
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,680
Do we have any other Dungeons and Dragons fans out there former players of Dungeons and Dragons or current?

326
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,400
Because that really got me into that type of art

327
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,480
So so yeah, I

328
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,600
Was going to show you that the Instagram of that. I mean, I'm still this is still a question

329
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,880
Oh, here's my wife's plate page. So I am married to Nicholas. I'm gonna say Nicholas to Doris Kappner

330
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,920
Who is in the other room and insisted I have coffee with her today?

331
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,600
Uh, oh boy movies get off that real quick. Um

332
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,920
She is doing sculpture. She's obsessed with sculpture lately

333
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,040
Uh, but yeah, and so being married to her is kind of nice because she's just she's not really interested in digital art

334
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,480
Uh, and I kind of am I kind of obsessed with I've built

335
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,560
Uh, you're talking about art, right? So I built ed tech retreat

336
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Uh, I get to brag about this. I guess

337
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,720
Uh, I I in second life I built the entire thing

338
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,800
Um, this I made this logo from scratch from scratch including the shading everything

339
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,040
I was super proud of it. I made t-shirts with that logo on it

340
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,440
I made a 3d rendition of the thing that like rotated over my head and blah blah blah

341
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I mean, this was a long time

342
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,400
so

343
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,320
I mean, this was really a long time ago. This is before my divorce

344
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,400
Etc. We had dance parties. God, we had fun. We had so much fun

345
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,080
And there's actually images of ed tech retreat

346
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,480
Uh, so this that here this is the um

347
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,720
architect rendering of the thing I eventually built in full

348
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,320
Um, anyway, so there's like a flicker

349
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,080
Feed on this. I mean you were asking about logos and art and stuff

350
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,840
So that's kind of what triggered this

351
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
Uh, there's no flicker feed for a tech retreat. That's so sad

352
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
I feel bad

353
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,680
I feel bad that all of our pictures are not there anymore

354
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,120
I think there's like a twitter feed for that too

355
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,600
Ed tech retreat

356
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,080
Uh, that was an amazing creative endeavor. I really really like to oh we already hear

357
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Is it instagram? Maybe it's instagram

358
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,440
Is it instagram?

359
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Instagram might have more things

360
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Okay, remember, I don't think there was an instagram back then

361
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
We go we click we click on things and go to the different

362
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Amy I haven't seen her forever

363
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,560
Uh, yeah all these amazing people that were educators

364
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
And I got into education

365
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
through

366
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:51,120
Through this through twitter actually, uh, I wanted to get into education. I wanted to do more than just, you know work

367
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
and couldn't find it but uh

368
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,920
Ed tech retreat mohacks. This is my avatar

369
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Custom had all reggae goes design nice

370
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,880
Uh, jump ushaw jump ushaw. We actually paid this guy $3,200 to architect our island for us, and then I built it

371
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,680
um

372
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,360
but yeah

373
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,120
I mean and that but you were talking about art. That's so I think that's where it came up

374
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,120
Uh, I'm trying to I'm trying to find my

375
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,400
Images, but I I think they're probably gone at this point. It's been so long ago

376
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,880
Uh, yeah, nothing nothing here

377
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Nothing here, man. That's kind of crazy

378
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,480
It's kind of crazy because there was so much stuff on there. We had like

379
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Lots of content, but it looks like it's all gone now. Anyway question

380
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,640
What was the question question was

381
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,560
Uh, what's your favorite favorite tech art anything related to goes little so I

382
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
Yeah, I mean, that's that's my favorite. Um

383
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,400
You know, I worked for Nike for a while and we did we did tech art there as well

384
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
But nothing like that

385
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,440
Tom a logo is the one this is my silly one that I made then I did a lot of art in second life in the 3d worlds

386
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Um, all right. So next question

387
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,040
Uh, what is the cheapest homelab server I can buy so I actually

388
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Seated this question

389
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,480
And because I've been getting this question a lot because I built a homelab server and I'm you know putting all my old hardware on there

390
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,920
But we found the the hp z

391
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,280
Uh, 640 and 600 series

392
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
to be by far

393
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,200
Uh, the most affordable after a day of research

394
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,200
So, uh, I actually bought this server

395
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,200
And it's renewed. This is a different one. This is not the same one. This is only eight core

396
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But you can get them

397
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
For all kinds you can get them

398
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,400
Uh, there's a 32 gigabyte memory. That's a smaller one

399
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,760
Um, but yeah, I mean you can like stack them, right? So I actually have one

400
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,240
Um, let me see if I can find it hp

401
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,680
Yeah, here it is

402
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,360
Uh, this is the actual one. Okay, and yes, the docs is my location. That's fine

403
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,800
Um, so this okay, so

404
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,880
Let me I have to tell you something about this. Okay. So this price tag

405
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,400
2250 $2,252

406
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,560
Includes

407
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,120
Uh, and this is something I didn't notice at first. It includes

408
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,360
um

409
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
2 by

410
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,240
This is the part I missed when I was looking at the specification

411
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:48,480
You see the 2 by it says 2 by z on 14 core processors. This system I have for $2,300

412
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,560
has

413
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
28 cores

414
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
That can be doubled

415
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
28 dual cores. So so it has a total

416
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,920
Of 56 possible cpu's when you're allocating virtual machines

417
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,440
And it has 120 28 gigabytes

418
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,200
Uh, which could be upgraded um ecc memory

419
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:20,160
And 512 gigabyte solid state drive for $2,300 and I defy you to find anything that's cheaper than this

420
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
So far it's been running really solidly. I have it over here running

421
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,840
Uh, and I'll keep reporting on it, but this by far is the cheapest I was able to find

422
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,320
Uh online. I I don't have any recommendations for any, uh, crypto of any kind. I don't do that stuff

423
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,560
um, but

424
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,400
but in terms of like

425
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,320
Home lab and like instantly being able to make your own Kubernetes clusters or putting if you're going to do proxmox

426
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,880
Just put it on here. Don't put it on anything above 14 nodes or your cluster will collapse like mine did

427
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,560
And we'll get to that. Um, so this is a fantastic

428
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Uh way to go

429
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,080
If if you want to do that, this is by far the cheapest thing I've ever found

430
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,320
Uh

431
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,720
Another there's another question. Why do you prefer linux as a subsystem within windows?

432
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,560
uh

433
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
I prefer

434
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,120
Linux as a subsystem within windows because and I've answered this lots and lots of times

435
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,240
But I will just give you the short answer

436
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
because

437
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,840
I stream

438
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,800
game

439
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
And I use windows at work

440
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,760
Because they don't allow you to lose linux on your desktop at work and 99 of the places you're going to work

441
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
You can't use linux on your desktop

442
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
So that's the main reason

443
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,960
Selfishly the main reason that I use windows for streaming and everything

444
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,480
Is because the streaming tools and obs are over the top better than anything on linux

445
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,440
Uh, you can't do it on linux. I did it for a year

446
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Uh, but it sucks

447
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,960
And anybody who tells you differently is lying to you. They're told I can objectively rip down any argument that says

448
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,040
That linux streaming is just as good as windows streaming. It absolutely is not

449
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,640
Absolutely is not. Let's mention if you're going to do gaming

450
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,000
Right and I know linux gaming has come a long way, but it is nowhere near windows gaming not even close

451
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,040
So I do windows gaming and I haven't had a hiccup. I actually my windows machine

452
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,640
Uh

453
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
Goes stays running these days up to a month

454
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,080
Uh, I don't have to reboot it for anything even if it has system things that says hey, you should probably reboot

455
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm like fine. I'm gonna wait

456
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,360
And then so what I do is I run a virtual machine that's got a gigabyte surround and two or three cores

457
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,800
Uh on side inside of my windows machine and then I ssh into it just like I would do if it were over there

458
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
And in my new home lab

459
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,160
Uh, I'm going to start doing that even more. In fact, they have the same name

460
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,560
I have anton as the name is kind of a you know

461
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
A nod to silicon valley

462
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,080
And and I'm going to be sshing into anton, which is now living over here

463
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,000
And we'll be on a ups and can run 24 seven blah blah blah blah

464
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,640
And then I don't have to depend on a vm for anything, but it but it's kind of a stage, right?

465
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
So, uh, if you don't have that if you don't have a server yet, then

466
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,520
Um, you you might want to consider a virtual machine that's running a one-two server specifically

467
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,760
Way better than red hat across the board for reasons. I'll talk about in a bit and

468
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,240
um

469
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,800
And and then I I just use windows for everything else

470
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,400
And then my my work computer officially is a mac

471
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,680
And I also have a mac so this whole bigotry about what computer you use

472
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,040
You just need to get over it on my opinion because

473
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,920
I mean mac hardware is top of the line

474
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,760
and

475
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,760
I mean and I actually might these mac minis are rock solid

476
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,000
I have been running these mac minis in my cluster for

477
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,160
Over three years and they are silent. They don't put out any heat

478
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,040
They just are really really good hardware and they have just really great design

479
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,920
So they're fantastic for for running linux

480
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,400
Unfortunately red hat doesn't agree that linux the red hat linux should be run on a mac and so they decided to not support it

481
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,240
Which is one of the reasons that I abandoned red hat and open shift

482
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,760
um, and and I'm going to actually talk about that now

483
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,560
so

484
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,640
So in a nutshell I've been complaining about this a lot recently and I'm just going to go out and just going to say it

485
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,560
um

486
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,160
and

487
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,840
By the way, if you get a chance to run linux on your desktop like I did at ibm for 12 years

488
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,080
Go for it. It's a really great way

489
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,000
I ran fedora on my desktop because I supported red hat at ibm

490
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,120
For 10 or 15 years and I wrote

491
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,680
rpm packages to install software. I know red hat inside and out

492
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,640
I owned stock in red hat in 2002

493
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,840
And sold it by the way after they did the whole fedora crap. So let me tell you a story

494
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,800
I know you like it when I tell stories. So I'm going to tell you a story. How much time do I have?

495
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,560
Uh, stories are easier for me to make my point. Okay, so way back when there was a company called

496
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,120
Uh red hat. All right, so I think that red hat started when did they start anybody know?

497
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,920
So red hat

498
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,760
started

499
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,520
When I want to say it was something like 99 98

500
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
um

501
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
Uh for more headquarters

502
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Uh, let's see opening

503
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,600
American Subs today founded in 1993. Wow, really. Okay. That makes sense

504
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,760
Yeah, because 93 94 that was when yeah, no, that's that sounds about right

505
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,800
It sounds about right because that was when 94 wasn't when I got into the Linux really good. Actually. No, god. It was before that

506
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
No, they must have been

507
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,520
They must have it. No, they just weren't popular yet

508
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,080
Okay, so here's the story

509
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:02,320
So, you know travel in time with me back to the 1990s when Linux became a thing a big thing

510
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,480
In fact, right before that unix was a big thing. Everybody was into

511
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,600
Indigo colored, you know, 80s colored work stations that were nice and pretty

512
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,200
And it was all about the work station. In fact, that led to

513
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,520
Steve Jobs making next step, which was a work station

514
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,040
It was all about work stations all about 3d as when Pixar was created and we would move past the pc

515
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,800
We moved past pcs

516
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,840
You know the max and the ibms and all that the people used to get worked on and accounting stuff and all that

517
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,840
And we kind of moved into this new age of like work stations work stations were the cool thing

518
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:45,040
These were these like 10 000 systems that sat on your desktop for doing 3d modeling and and drafting

519
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,840
And you know, whatever. I mean like really amazing stuff right and that was also the dawn of the worldwide web

520
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,840
So we started to see these things doubling as web servers and blah, blah, blah

521
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
so you go back to that time and

522
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,840
Unix was proprietary. There was a unix provider called Solaris

523
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,680
Which was founded in stanford for free by the way, according to the stanford university policy

524
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,160
Which says you can start up very interesting story

525
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,840
If you want to see thank you for this something if you want to see the full story of Solaris

526
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,480
I cannot recommend more. It's very boring, but recommend more triumph of the nerds 2.01

527
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:30,720
Which goes through the creation of the internet and it talks about macabre, you know, the uh, what's his face?

528
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,760
Uh, who started some microsystems and then you know, uh, he was I mean, it's it's there's a lot there to talk about

529
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Either creation of ethernet and all of that

530
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,840
So anyway, Solaris and sun microsystem who by the way, if you happen to recognize the name later invented java

531
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,080
Uh, and then marketed it for 500 000 dollars the largest marketing budget of any language ever in history

532
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,760
um

533
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,040
Became a thing so the ellison it wasn't ellison. That was oracle

534
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,600
Yeah, it was a completely different thing happening. It was very very proprietary

535
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,240
No, Larry Ellison made oracle

536
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,280
No, I'm I'm thinking of macafe the guys started three come

537
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Oh god, let me get his name

538
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,200
uh

539
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Who started he was part of the

540
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,920
Uh, he was part of the original uh, palo alto crew at his iranx and then he's he forked off his own thing

541
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,400
um

542
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
And it's it's like escaping me

543
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,480
Robert Metcalfe, that's it. It's not macafe. That's this that's the software guy. That's the security guy. It's Metcalf

544
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Robert Metcalfe 1979

545
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,080
um

546
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,760
so

547
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
uh, okay, so

548
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,960
anyway

549
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
um

550
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
In this atmosphere of like

551
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,240
You know, we need to the AT&T unix was 3000 dollars a seat

552
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,160
And so there was lots of stuff coming up. Berkeley made bsd. Berkeley, you know that at Berkeley. They made it

553
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,360
Uh, there was lots of people experimenting at torwald's across the the world was experimenting with making

554
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,120
Uh a replacement for minix, which was was college professor's colonel

555
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,520
And that then he came up with linux, but they didn't have any way to talk to anybody else because there was no internet yet

556
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,080
Yeah

557
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
I think the stream dropped

558
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,760
But it could be my internet

559
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,400
Oh, I hope I hope not and please confirm for anybody else that the stream is dropped. I I still see

560
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I see a a red bit rate

561
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Says he went offline

562
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
Uh, but i'm not offline. It says i'm still streaming

563
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Going up and now you're back to zero viewers

564
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Yeah, what's up with that?

565
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,560
It dropped 30 seconds. It's back

566
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
That is really weird

567
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
Um, is it back?

568
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,600
I mean, uh, yeah, it's back now. It is back now. Okay. Well, thankfully that'll still be on the youtube

569
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Mostly just me talking, but thank you

570
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Uh, you dropped for me

571
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,800
Yeah, I don't know what dropped. I can't begin to

572
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,880
Guess maybe it's my server. I don't know. We'll see probably not, but

573
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,720
Everybody back. Okay. So so anyway, let me finish the story. So, uh, at the time

574
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,400
You know, people were thinking about different versions of unix and everything

575
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,320
and

576
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,720
So there was slack where there were lots of options

577
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,560
And one of the biggest ones early on the alternative the unix was solaris, which is proprietary

578
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,640
But it was still kind of freeform and everybody loved it because they had a better attitude

579
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,080
And but they were still proprietary and at the same time

580
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,760
Linux kind of became a thing because it's like no, we really want something that's free

581
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,840
and it was actually, uh, the guy who taught me about unix

582
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,720
Who I said, man, I wish I had this at home and he turned he goes well

583
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,680
He can always run linux and so I started running linux at home

584
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
and

585
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,720
um

586
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,280
And at the time there weren't that many options that I had a power pc mac because I was doing web design and thing

587
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,080
And so I I ended up doing mock linux

588
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,960
Later I would get a p2 opinion and I would end up running

589
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,880
Slackware for a while and then I would try mandrake linux, which is susie

590
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,880
And eventually I would use red hat and red hat came out when red hat came out on the scene

591
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
It was a big deal

592
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,120
Red hat was a huge deal and it was probably the most important free, uh distribution on the planet

593
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,560
Now fast they promised, you know, that they were going to support everything and and everything in it

594
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
And that was really great. Everybody was really behind it

595
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,200
Uh, and then 2002 or something came around and they decided to make fedora and they said look we're going to make

596
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,920
Uh red hat proprietary in other words, we're going to sell it for the to the enterprise

597
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,320
Uh, and we're not going to release red hat

598
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,280
for use by the the community, but

599
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,760
We're going to make this thing called fedora so people can volunteer their time and effort

600
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,040
And build up fedora and we can steal all of their innovation put it into our product and sell it

601
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,640
Because that's what they did and at the time there was a major major

602
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,880
like

603
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Backlash against red hat

604
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,800
I mean, it was a serious backlash anybody that's that old might remember it

605
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:13,600
Um, but they were a disaster. I mean, they were a disaster of a company making horrible decisions

606
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,560
Moving into I mean not horrible decisions

607
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,920
Maybe decisions that were in their best interests that we're going to make them a lot of money, which it did

608
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,280
And they became the standard distribution for enterprise

609
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
And everybody else was like man, we want to do that too

610
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,600
So that was pretty much the first open core company

611
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,200
That's a term coined by git lab, which means their product is open source

612
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,360
But they make money on it on the side by all their

613
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,800
Proprietary add-ons and if you really want to get into this go watch dalman talk about all the little proprietary crap that they

614
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,040
Inject into linux in order to stick their hooks into enterprise and make them pay big subscription rates and stuff

615
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,040
So and that you might be fine with that, you know, you might be fine with that

616
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,200
But that is not the linux way

617
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,760
It is not the fos and open source way and there was a massive backlash against it

618
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,560
But nobody cared because red hat was making gobs and gobs of money because it was bringing linux into the enterprise and to this day

619
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,520
red hat is still so

620
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,040
deeply deeply embedded in the enterprise that ibm bought them for 30 something billion

621
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,640
And now consider changing their name for a moment. Apparently that's that's the rumor to red hat because it was so significant

622
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,480
So now ibm, you know, who brags every year about how many software patents it has

623
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,280
And keeps back engineers from becoming distinguished engineers unless they don't get a patent

624
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,440
Who lied to me in the 1999 with the peace love and linux campaign or to get me in the door and then turns out

625
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,680
It's all a bunch of bullshit

626
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,200
That company is the company that now owns and operates red hat

627
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,760
And if you think for a second that red hat is ever going to do anything in the best interests of the overall linux community

628
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,200
You'd be mistaken as a company individual engineers at red hat will

629
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,160
There's many many individual engineers and they support open source and they're doing amazing things

630
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,520
uh

631
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,880
The most controversial linux commit that ever happened in my history is system d

632
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,440
The guy who invented it invented it at red hat for the sake of enterprise because enterprise had a specific need

633
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,080
And they said that they had a specific need and they made it and they pushed it in and they got it in all of enterprise

634
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,880
And now it's in a bun tune. It's in everything else. It's highly controversial. I'm actually still okay with it

635
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,080
Slightly the guy that made it by the way. I guess where he went he quit from red hat and he went he works for microsoft now

636
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,880
Which if I if you know anything about the history of linux

637
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,280
The idea that the lead engineer the person who got death threats for creating system d is now working for microsoft

638
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,760
I mean, it's all I have to say about that and you just know what i'm talking about now microsoft ironically has moved forward

639
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,000
And they are more pro linux than I think sometimes even red hat is

640
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,640
I mean, you know, they're doing they're still very proprietary

641
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,840
But the the point is is that all of these companies that said that

642
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,280
Balmers words exactly that linux is a viral operating system and any company is crazy to install it

643
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Are all like changing their tune and saying oh linux is awesome. We're going to do it

644
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,320
Uh, do you think non non system d distros are a big deal? I don't know

645
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,240
Uh, I don't know. I I don't think you can get away without system d reasonably

646
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,760
There's no motivation behind it if you're going to do that you might as well just go bsd

647
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,480
And there's a lot of software that there's a lot of like, you know routers and stuff that use it still so

648
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,480
Uh, nobody knows the system d a system d replace it replace the init system that it's kind of

649
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,920
And there's many advantages of it and disadvantages the advantages are you have this monolithic startup system

650
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That's not really unixy

651
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,160
Um, but it has you know state so it can keep track of things better

652
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,160
Uh, it can be more secure and but it you know at the cost of being this big monolith that has to be deployed

653
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,240
It has all control to the whole system. It's a very very controversial thing

654
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,640
That controversy has largely passed though and it's now the standard in all enterprise linux distros

655
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,520
Uh, so uh, but bsd unix which is still the primary distro used in router software

656
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And stuff like that does not use it

657
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,440
Uh, and it still uses the traditional init system. So you have to go do your own research on that. Um,

658
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,200
I

659
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,480
I don't really don't have an opinion on that. I do think

660
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,040
That we kind of have to make some, you know con concessions. I mean cononical and shuttleworth taught us that

661
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,400
That the linux world has to make concessions with the enterprise community if we're going to move linux forward

662
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:40,640
So it's kind of a delicate dance. You have to you know make in order to to to walk that middle line

663
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,440
But red hat is clearly not and this is this is the tipping point for me. Okay

664
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,560
And I know the question was about open shift and I'll get to that

665
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,000
But the question the the question is about, you know, red hat and open shift

666
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,640
So this weekend and I wrote about this so might as well if you want to go read about it this weekend. I I installed

667
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,480
Red hat on my mac mini, okay

668
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,840
And I was like, okay

669
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,000
I installed rocky linux and uh, which is you know red hat and I went through all the problems

670
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,560
It's got a horrible graphic installer. I mean, it's disastrously bad compared to a bunch of server

671
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,720
A bunch of server install is so stinking slick. I just don't have words for how good it is

672
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,400
And I have been using that my whole life. I mean recently and so then I go

673
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,600
So then I try to do red hat and red hat just falls on its face

674
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,800
It can't do certain things. It doesn't have this other thing. It doesn't have this other thing and

675
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,000
Uh, no, I installed rocky linux not red has enterprise linux. Do they have a different installer?

676
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,120
If they have it if there's a different installer

677
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,520
With then I will have to eat my hat

678
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,560
And go do red hat enterprise linux installer instead of rocky linux installer. Either way

679
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,440
Uh, the issue that I hit after that

680
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,480
Uh, still applies. So

681
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,480
We hit an issue and I actually wrote about this in my zettelcast and you go read it

682
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,720
where

683
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,160
Um, I found a forum on red hat that said

684
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,400
Do all of these things if you want to get your mac mini to work

685
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,560
With red hat with red hat networking stuff and it was, you know, totally doable

686
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,360
It was just quite a bit of stuff and I have like 19 of these things that I have to set up

687
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,320
And I was going to have to go through all of these individual steps for all of them

688
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,280
And you know red hat tries to have a smart install

689
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,760
But it really sucks compared to cloud in it and stuff like it in in canonical and you know in in ubuntu

690
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,880
It's not even the same. In fact ubuntu could be cited as the the standard for

691
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
cloud-based, you know

692
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,560
operating system initialization cloud in it is by far the industry standard for that and

693
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,840
So anyway, so red has got this other answer and in the forum thread

694
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,520
Somebody says well, this is on a mac and the the the person officially representing red hat

695
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,560
Basically threw him under the bus and said

696
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,640
Oh, well, that's mac hardware. We don't we don't ever test on anything on mac

697
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:06,000
And and the reason that that offends a guy like me who was alive and owned red hat stock in 2000

698
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,560
2001

699
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,600
And eventually sold it when they did the whole fedora thing is because back then

700
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,400
Red hat promised the world that they were just as much a member of the overall linux community as everybody else

701
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,400
That they were going to maintain that love and support for linux on all hardware, you know

702
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:32,480
And that we were going to continue with the mission of empowering old hardware with new linux distro installations and

703
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,680
Recycling, you know old computers, which is all I mean that this is the core values

704
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,320
Of linux if you're in the linux community, those are our core values

705
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,000
That we we have choice we get to say what we want to do we can we can make it so that it runs on any hardware

706
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,480
And to be fair red hat still does run it just takes all this extra work

707
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,520
And so for red hat official people to say we really don't care about you if you're running on mac

708
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,240
Is basically just them confirming what everybody has known all along would end up happening in 2022

709
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,080
The only thing they care about is enterprise period. It's in the name red hat enterprise linux

710
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,080
There's no such thing as anything but enterprise them because people don't run mac minis in the enterprise because that would be silly

711
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
There's actually a lot of people who do

712
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,760
They're fantastic home lab machines, by the way, they're much more powerful than a raspberry pi

713
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,960
They have better hardware and they're cheaper than a lot of mainframe, you know other big systems

714
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,120
And if you're not going to do virtualization and you want an actual hardware instance, they're actually pretty good for that

715
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,200
So, you know as long as they have intel chips in them and they have one thing is a whole different question

716
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,560
We don't even go there

717
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,840
So but you know, there's no plan for them to support it

718
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,400
But but the the arrogance of them to just say oh, we don't care about mac people

719
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,120
That just really upset me and frankly

720
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,960
You know, if I am an enterprise cto, I'm not going to care about that either

721
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,120
I'm like, no, I'm really happy that you're spending all of your money and time and energy

722
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,360
Supporting my hardware. Why would you even dream of wasting your energy?

723
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,480
You know making sure to test your distribution on any mac hardware at all. That's a waste of your time

724
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,360
And if I'm an enterprise cto, I agree with that

725
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,800
But I'm not an enterprise cto. I'm a guy running a home lab

726
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,040
and I'm I'm

727
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,480
Taking all of the hardware that I have and there is a company that has values that are consistent with that

728
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,440
And that's canonical. You can you can throw them under the bus all you want, but the name ubuntu means what does it mean?

729
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,640
What does ubuntu mean?

730
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,440
And if I don't we're in short ubuntu has a few meanings when used as a

731
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,920
As a naguni bantu term ubuntu means humanity. However, it is sometimes translated as I am because we are

732
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,600
So the diagram of ubuntu is, you know, the logo is like all these arms and arm and arm

733
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,320
And you know canonical has done some weird things. They are a company as well, but the company values have never changed

734
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,600
I mean, they're just as relevant in the enterprise microkates and all the stuff that they're doing

735
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,440
Uh, and and they're doing, you know, like really really amazing things

736
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,680
And so they're you know, I haven't seen about red hat red has become the apple of linux

737
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,900
red hat really has become the apple of linux

738
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,240
They

739
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,800
They want to say that they're doing free stuff. They really don't care

740
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,000
They're just catering to the enterprise and they just need to come clean and own it

741
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,320
Um, and then everybody else can make that decision if you want to be relevant in the enterprise

742
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,640
But I tell you what there's a lot of enterprises that are picking that are avoiding red hat

743
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,040
And so the reason and I actually don't like open shift for all the same reasons red hat and open shift

744
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,760
Have done everything in their power to lock you in

745
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
to their product

746
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,480
and um

747
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,480
so

748
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,320
No, it's not like 10. No, I don't know. So the um

749
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,600
So the the problem the problem we have

750
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,760
Is that we have an enterprise operating like an enterprise

751
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,360
with

752
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:03,040
all of its priorities which are to lock you in and create systems that you depend on completely

753
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,880
And they've very openly but they've been very open about doing that and they

754
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,360
They're trying to do that and for I don't want that

755
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:16,080
I don't want that a bottom line. I I want open standards and red hat can tell you all they want about open standards

756
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,160
But as long as they control the standard

757
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,400
And and they have been doing that. I mean and they've done some good things. I mean bilda was great

758
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,840
It took red hat to kind of go at it proprietary wise with docker. Docker was also one of these companies

759
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,000
I want to lock you in they just proved it by forcing everybody to pay for their enterprise product

760
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,520
Docker desktop

761
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,760
So they've always been a company and they haven't really given a crap about free and open source software at all

762
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
At the end of the day, they're a company and they need to make money

763
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,160
And there's people there's people in the company who like to believe that they

764
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,760
Have the the needs of the open source community at heart

765
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,320
But then when they force everybody who's already got

766
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,920
desktop linux on their enterprise systems to pay money because it's a big

767
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,240
You know behemoth enterprises got the money

768
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,800
Then you see their true colors show and they there's nothing wrong with them making money

769
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,520
They're actually legally bound to make money. That's part of what being an s-corp or a c-corp is

770
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,200
But

771
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,200
They just need to own that they are no longer free and open source. They really don't care

772
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,920
They care about making money and so

773
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,200
I know i'm going kind of off the off the edge here, but

774
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,000
People know that i've been kind of in the middle of the road when it comes to like

775
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,240
corporate enterprisey conservative kind of you know, you know values and ethos and you know

776
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:35,600
Really really off the deep end fsf kind of like if you're not using gpl v3, you're the devil and should be cancelled

777
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,720
You know, and i'm kind of in the middle there

778
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,200
But this whole experience with my lab has kind of shifted me back towards the fsf side

779
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,160
Not quite i'm more like torval torval's is kind of dead center in the middle of it

780
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:57,360
Uh, you know, he understands the needs of corporations and thinks you gpl v3 is the devil and I agree, but but

781
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,400
You know, he would not go so far as to say

782
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,040
Everybody should put red hat on all their computers

783
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,760
You know, he stays out of that fight completely mostly by focusing on the kernel architectures and stuff

784
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:13,360
So that's a pretty long rant, but I I feel like I owe it to everybody

785
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,680
Let's see if we can change the tone up a little bit though

786
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,760
Uh, the open nature of linux and proliferation of distros saves us a lot. I I agree

787
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,720
And you know and and somebody let me let me show you another symptom of this, okay

788
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,720
So somebody said to me today, uh lbg, I think it was, you know, who's fond of reminding me of stuff that I forget

789
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,400
Which is always good

790
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,200
They said, well, we would be nowhere in the container space

791
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
Uh, if it weren't for red hat

792
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,440
And and and lbg told me about this site github.com slash containers

793
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,000
Do you see any indication on this site that this site is red hat the company?

794
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,520
There's none

795
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:57,680
You have to like dig. There's no official statement that this that this website is from red hat

796
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,320
Why doesn't red hat put red hat in their github container and their github name?

797
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,080
Because they know

798
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,520
That's what I think I think it's because they know they know if they were to put github.com slash red hat and nobody would open it

799
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,840
And so yeah, I have a look at nix's pretty cool

800
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,120
So so no so they they went to github.com containers. There is no way for you to know

801
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,880
And and let's see you and they started as soon as you start looking at the technology list

802
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:31,040
You're like realizing hmm pod man. Oh build a scopio. What the hell? This is red hat

803
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,000
Right

804
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,480
And then you start to realize and then you start to look at the names here

805
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,720
You get there's a guy with a red hat. Just hope he was awesome

806
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,480
I mean look as I said the people at red hat are awesome the company

807
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,840
Right so just said he's really awesome software engineer at red hat

808
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,120
You know and the rest of them they're not going to tell you where they work

809
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,240
I mean, you know who they were if you know you know names so you can look at them

810
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,840
So so this this is a good. This is a good example of red hat

811
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:07,120
Trying to hide the fact that they're red hat because they don't want to be associated with all the things red hat has become associated with

812
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,880
And and that includes filming their nose at

813
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,240
Anything that they don't like or any any of the the other part of the linux distribution

814
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,640
They the red hat is one of the worst linux citizens. They are the apple of linux

815
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,240
They and as far as I'm concerned. I don't want anything to do with red hat ever again

816
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,600
Uh in terms of a distribution and as a company I I will still use their their

817
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
Contributions because I have to

818
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
I can't avoid them

819
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,200
Because I don't you know, I don't have a say they don't care what I say

820
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,680
They you know so build a pod man and things and they'll continue to make stuff that

821
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,280
You know is used out there and I still think that there's stuff that you just like apple. I use apple products, right?

822
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But I hate apple

823
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,680
I know I it's hard not being a hypocrite. I mean, how are you going to get work done if you don't use it?

824
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,400
So it's like, you know, it doesn't mean I have to like it, right?

825
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,960
so um

826
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,280
Anyway, uh speaking of things I I come to not like recently. I know this is a very ranty night

827
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,720
Today, but I I I feel like I I mean I wasted a lot of time this weekend on stuff that I wish I hadn't

828
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,240
Uh, and I wish I had thought through a little bit better

829
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,520
Uh, so open shift is as everybody knows is kubernetes

830
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
Is red hats variation on kubernetes?

831
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,760
Uh, it has some very good things in it. It it it to be completely honest though

832
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:36,320
The biggest difference between red hat and canonical is red hat over engineers everything

833
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:44,560
And they're brilliant the red hand engineers are brilliant and they over engineer shit and they don't make it usable

834
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,480
It's it's one of their regular problems and canonical

835
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:54,320
Is really really good at simplifying and thinking about usability

836
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:01,120
But they sometimes lack the engineering expertise that red hat has and what would be really great is that we could get the middle of that

837
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:07,760
You know, I just wish that they had done that they had done that I wish and and canonical's got great engineers

838
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,280
I'm gonna be wrong but but the the reason that I want to promote canonical and ebuntu is because

839
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,760
Their products have always been

840
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,520
You I mean to a fault. I mean snap comes to mind, right? Uh, have always been

841
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,440
Like focused on usability above everything else

842
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:35,040
Uh, if they over it I I happen to think that over engineering is a sign of a somebody you don't want to work with

843
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,680
but that's

844
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,880
There's there are people there are people there are engineers in this world

845
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,320
And you know if you've been around for any amount of time there are engineers in this world

846
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,920
Who think that the most over engineered complex solution is the best one because only smart people understand it

847
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,640
And I cannot overstate

848
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:59,600
How stupid that is and how that person those type of engineers should be weeded out and fired immediately

849
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:07,840
The it is so complicated that the most brilliant people are the ones you can take a highly complex system

850
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,440
And turn it into something that can be some simplicity

851
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,560
Uh, uh lock ins are depressing

852
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,760
My my we have a comment here. My actual and first job is pushing me towards learning open shift on top of already existing

853
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,600
I've been products the lock ins are depressing. They are they're depressing and so look

854
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,880
I had a choice in my home lab and in my personal life

855
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,320
Uh to say look, I I do not need or want to learn red hat

856
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,160
And and I don't want to stay current. I mean the argument for me to put it on there was hey

857
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,720
I'm going to stay current. I'll be able to get a good job. I get my r.h.c. You know

858
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,040
I'll be good to go if I want to be an infrastructure engineer

859
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,600
And if you if you want to be an infrastructure engineer today

860
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,640
I'm very sad to report that you cannot be one if you don't know red hat

861
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,320
You have to know it

862
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,840
But there is a certain percentage of jobs out there that people are hiring

863
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,920
Hiring either container-based or dev ops or cloud native and there are some

864
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:03,600
Big shops. I imagine I haven't seen any that actually use a bunch of server and I have a choice

865
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,200
And my choice is to prepare for those jobs

866
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,440
Even if that job is way way way harder for me to find and this goes for rusted go and I don't I just to compare it

867
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,720
I you know, I had I once advised somebody who ended up getting a job in influx db doing go programming

868
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,400
Get well some new rust

869
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,560
Uh, I I told him point blank. I said, you know

870
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,880
It you go for it. Go for it. Go. I you guys won't believe this about me

871
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,120
But I actually encourage this guy to go find a rust job. I said, look, you you know, it's gonna you're gonna have to sacrifice

872
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,600
You might have to move to germany. There's lots of like rust jobs in germany

873
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,120
um

874
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:42,320
But you know if if that's your real passion then you're gonna have to make a sacrifice and find a company that has it

875
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,920
And he came in one day on his own to me without me saying anything

876
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,400
He says I'm starting to think that I should learn go

877
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,200
So I can get the job and then I can just have rust and do that on the side until it gets big

878
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,840
And he got six how he got the job. That's exactly how he got the job

879
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,280
Because in all of influx db isn't go except for flux the flux language, which is in rust

880
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,520
They ended up getting a job working on that

881
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,760
The point is that

882
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,160
You don't have to pick

883
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,080
Uh, the mainstream stuff esxi. I mean

884
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,640
You know, you don't have to pick those things

885
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
Uh, I'm gotten older

886
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,120
So I my picks are largely in line and training you as largely in line with what's going to get you an immediate job

887
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,560
But sometimes especially like right now

888
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,520
You know, you have the choice to say

889
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,440
You know, I don't need to give in on that for example

890
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,320
If I want to use Linux on the desktop if you want to lose Linux on the desktop and you don't want to work anywhere

891
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,760
That doesn't let you do that

892
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,520
You can filter out 80 of the companies out there and you can say look

893
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,560
I don't want to work for any company that is too stupid to not let me use Linux on my desktop

894
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,400
And I used to I used to joke with my old manager. He's gone now. He left you retired

895
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,240
But I used to joke with him after he hired me

896
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,400
I was like, you know, if I had asked that one question

897
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,360
I would never have taken this job because they forced me to use a macro windows

898
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,880
And I after being using Linux on the desktop for 12 years

899
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,640
And I adapted and I'm using vmware now and everything but

900
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,520
But seriously if you're interviewing

901
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,160
You can choose I guess that's the point I'm making you can choose to say

902
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,480
No

903
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,080
And you can there's never been a time when you could be more picky, especially if you're good

904
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,320
You can say look, I I don't you know, no, you're gonna make me you're gonna make me use windows every day. Goodbye

905
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,200
There's like, you know, 10 other people down the street that will hire me

906
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,480
I mean, but you have to make your own decisions if you want to make your

907
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,960
Chances for working in a place

908
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,560
A lot of jesson qualifiers, you know, they use it on the server, of course

909
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,560
Uh, and you know, but but you can you can do the same thing you can make a choice

910
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:48,320
You can say I don't work want to work for any company that uses red hat servers

911
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,840
Right, you can do that

912
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:59,120
That's a very very very tiny list of companies that you'll work for and you'll be eliminating most of the fortune 500

913
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,920
Uh, but

914
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,880
You can do it. You can do that. You know, it's your choice

915
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,000
Uh, you could you could say, you know, whatever so

916
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,280
that you anyway, um

917
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:18,320
Uh, that that's kind of uh, that topic. Let me let me see if I can save some of these

918
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,960
I mean, we do we were a little bit late. So I'll try to to bump bump through the rest of these questions really quickly

919
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,600
A desktop too. Yeah

920
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,760
Uh, why did I bend a proxmox? So

921
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,560
People have been watching me do my uh, home lab and it stuff

922
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,480
and

923
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,280
uh

924
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,800
proxmox

925
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,200
I I did not know this when I got into it. I really wish I had I wrote a lot about it in my zed if you want to read it

926
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,560
Uh, the the short answer is uh proxmox maximum that maximum nodes in a cluster is 32

927
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:53,520
Uh, I got the 14 nodes in my cluster and proxmox started falling on its face in ways that I won't go into detail on

928
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,360
Uh, it just could not the coral sink could not keep everything updated

929
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,520
Uh, I had caching problems because the icons were not getting refreshed properly

930
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:08,320
And all the problems I was having were confirmed by tons and tons of forum posts on proxmox from the people having the same problem

931
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,680
and

932
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,520
uh, everybody

933
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,400
Um

934
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:19,280
That I ask who says proxmox works great for them. It has like less than five nodes usually just one node and and they use it

935
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:26,000
So, uh, I mean I was already kind of leery of the whole afero gpl v3 license that proxmox was released under

936
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,960
Uh, and the whole use of you know dependency on a web interface

937
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,840
I mean, I did like it. It was it was super pretty

938
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,800
Uh, but it's definitely not necessary. And so

939
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,640
After I hit those problems, I was like now proxmox is out of here

940
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:45,280
And and then another another problem too is that I noticed that all of my four gigabyte mac minis gave up

941
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,640
1.2 gigabytes of ram just to running the proxmox

942
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,120
uh agent

943
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,200
That's true story

944
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Just to run the proxmox agent

945
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,040
Which which is I mean to run the base the base, you know virtual machine

946
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,800
And then the proxmox agent on top of that took up 1.2 gigabytes of ram

947
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,000
So I had about three gigabytes of ram left to do anything with really anyway

948
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,360
I haven't done a comparison with uh a bunch of server

949
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,120
I went ahead and put the full version of service to the minified version

950
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,840
On my nodes at this point and I went ahead and reinstalled and put that on 19 different things

951
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,840
So I'm going to be running a bunch of server on everything

952
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,640
um, and then I'm going to be running kvm and live vert and vert manager from

953
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,760
Uh, my main server directly and then also the vnc and stuff like that from it

954
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,720
I don't really need anything to do that management

955
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,960
I'm looking at like ansible to kind of help with that but after looking at it

956
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,080
How problematic ansible is with the whole python thing? I'm actually thinking about making my own

957
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,480
single binary agent

958
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,800
That's compiled with bonsai that runs on the endpoints

959
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,080
That does essentially what I did when I was at IBM and I wrote

960
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,040
I wrote an entire infrastructure framework

961
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,720
for audit compliance and security for 52 000 machines

962
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,200
I'm thinking about doing the same sort of thing and go just as a fun project. It's a home lab

963
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,760
That's what they're for and I absolutely hate all the solutions that are out there right now

964
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:11,760
Because they require python virtual environments and they they over step in what they do to the

965
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,440
Virtual machines and and if you still are running on on iron and you don't want to run under vm because you're going to take a

966
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,480
30% loss through your containers. That's another stat. I found

967
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,040
I switched to kvm vert box from virtual virtual box. Did you really cool?

968
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:31,840
And I I mean, I really think kvm is the way to go. I kvm is the basis for all major cloud providers now

969
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,800
Uh, and it's it's going to be the future

970
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,720
And so anything that I can do that plays in the kvm space

971
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,560
Uh, it's going to be more relevant long term and it's also fun

972
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,760
So I am going to be writing. I'm looking at salt right now, but that's also python and I was like, eh

973
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:54,720
So I may be stealing some of the best ideas of these configuration management systems and creating one and go if one doesn't already exist

974
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,240
and doing that I might actually resurrect fluff, which is um

975
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,600
Was what I started some time ago to do this very thing to provision

976
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,160
You know vm's really quickly and based on profiles and things like that

977
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,880
But to do it on a local machine using, you know, your local installation of vmware

978
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,120
Uh, I started out with virtual box

979
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,400
We had three providers and they would do it locally if you had enough, you know prox

980
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,680
But I think we could come back to the to the fluff thing and maybe come up with some sort of distributed thing as well

981
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,800
And now we're like controlling things remotely as well. So, uh, if we do that, that'll be a bonsai branch

982
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,160
It'll be fluff as a bonsai branch and then we'll be able to put that in your monolith

983
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,880
And your bonsai is your monolith or whatever you want to do

984
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,560
So that's that's all development that I plan to do over, you know

985
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,080
When this whether gets colder and stuff and after I get my lab set up

986
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,520
So if you want to watch any of that happening, it's going to be going for a while. Yes, it is a not invented here thing

987
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:54,640
I'm making a mountain what I really don't understand is why there's not a better product in this space. That's a single binary

988
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,200
Uh, the closest thing to it is terraform

989
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:04,160
Which is just orchestration. I mean you can bend it's arm and make it do configuration management, but it's not designed for that

990
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:11,600
Um, and there's no combination of configuration orchestration and and stuff like fabric which just runs remote

991
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,120
Uh, you know, just run this one thing remote and give you back the results

992
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,160
And I I I don't know why, um

993
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,400
And I I feel like there's some area for innovation on that front

994
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,880
Uh, what's the font? This is group. This is uh, ubuntu mono

995
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,720
Yeah, it just looks good because I I adopted the group box

996
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,000
So and and I run it at a pretty high

997
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,440
Uh size so that you can read it from wherever

998
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,960
Uh, what is your font about that? We under that. Um

999
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,480
So the question should you should you try to run Linux on max of apples actually trying to keep it from happening?

1000
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,880
Uh

1001
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,880
The answer to this is

1002
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Yes in your home lab

1003
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,800
So

1004
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:02,560
There's kind of two contexts for when you make a decision about what you want to run Linux on if you're

1005
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,200
picking hardware for

1006
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
any size organization

1007
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,480
Obviously, you're not going to buy max for that

1008
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,880
but

1009
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:19,520
If you are working for a school or somebody that has a bunch of old lab hardware

1010
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:26,320
Mac minis like mine or other old hardware and you don't have the budget to

1011
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,880
You know use the cloud or even have a good internet connection for god's sakes

1012
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,960
There are max errors. Yeah, but yeah, um, we were talking so

1013
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,760
Uh, yeah, they're 10 and they were on aix. Do you remember the 90s?

1014
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,760
In the 90s. Yeah, the power PCs. They're on aix. This is IBM tech

1015
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,880
So anyway, um

1016
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:54,640
Yeah, I can tell that people are not as interested. I have to say anymore that the viewers are dropping a little bit

1017
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,960
Uh, that's fine. I don't care. So you should try to run Linux on max. I I do think

1018
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,280
That if you

1019
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,080
Have an old mac and you want to breathe life into it again

1020
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,920
Because especially if it's been written off by apple who said we're not supporting that anymore

1021
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,680
Goodbye

1022
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,600
And and it has intel hardware, which is a lot of old intel and I said, yeah, hell, yeah

1023
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,720
Uh osx server. Yeah, the cheese grader mac pro

1024
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,560
And it has osx. Yes

1025
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,800
Uh, it's yeah, it does. Well, yeah, I mean they're

1026
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,280
Yes, the answer is yes. I I think you should run Linux on anything and everything

1027
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:42,080
And I have made a great hobby and passion of mine to do that. There was a time when I couldn't drop

1028
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,760
Five grand on a server and make, you know, the sweet corporate money now

1029
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,800
But there was a time when I was we're starting out and there's a lot of you out there watching right now who don't have that kind of

1030
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,840
money

1031
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,840
and you are

1032
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,680
You know at best in a in a dorm or you're trying to get it to run and you're trying to dual boot your mid laptops and stuff, right

1033
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,560
and to someone like that just having a server

1034
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,160
Of any kind having a separate computer to run Linux on is and use it as a server and leave it plugged into the wall

1035
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,640
it's a big deal

1036
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,760
and

1037
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:21,600
For many people they will find old hard. I had one guy who was the son of the director of tech for david's college

1038
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,200
And he had like thousands of dollars and left over hardware. It made me so sick

1039
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,760
but he just got so

1040
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,640
you know

1041
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,160
Linux

1042
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,160
Linux is

1043
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,880
I mean one part of the core ethos of Linux is

1044
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,040
Breathing new life into old hardware no matter what

1045
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,600
And you'd be surprised what people can put Linux on it's amazing

1046
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,560
Uh

1047
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,360
To be mean to viewers. Yeah, I can't be pretty mean so anyway, um

1048
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,760
So what I'm trying to say is that um

1049
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,400
Is that

1050
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,640
You should you should try to run on anything and don't let people put you down

1051
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,880
If you're running it on like a p2

1052
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:12,080
Or you know some really ancient hardware because you know what you'd be surprised. This is another thing about Linux

1053
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,160
I never get tired

1054
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,920
of

1055
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,880
Dealing particularly when I was mentoring people directly one-on-one in person

1056
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,920
I don't get this

1057
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,240
I don't get this buzz as much as I used to because I don't deal with people and it's really annoying actually

1058
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,280
One of my I didn't get paid much when I ran my own company because I lower the rate really low

1059
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,280
So I can do the bare minimum

1060
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,800
And so one of the things that was valuable to me was being in person with somebody when they're learning this stuff

1061
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,960
All of the aha moments. Oh

1062
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,960
Oh

1063
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,760
I used to be present when they would have these moments and they were worth like a hundred dollars each to me

1064
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,800
They still are

1065
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,080
I miss it

1066
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,320
This is why I want to I want y'all to stream so I can get you know paid

1067
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,040
through watching you discover stuff

1068
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,320
because because

1069
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,680
Seriously, so

1070
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,160
One of those times there there is nothing better that okay

1071
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:07,840
So one guy actually brought in is another story one guy brought in I told him I said look if you look it goes

1072
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,400
I don't have a computer. I don't know where to go. I said I promise you

1073
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,000
Next time you're at a family gathering if you ask your family members

1074
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,400
If anybody has an old computer in the closet or the attic someplace that they're keeping because it's got old tax records on it

1075
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,520
Right, it's got old tax records on it and they're too afraid to give it to goodwill

1076
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,480
And I guarantee you there are tons of them if you go find those things and they say well, we don't want to give

1077
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,000
It's got tax records. Okay. Well or browser histories or something like that, right?

1078
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,560
You could you can go find it you will find one

1079
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,640
I promise you and you promise them that you will wipe that disc clean and that you will make it better

1080
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,640
and that you will put it to good use

1081
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,320
And I you would not believe how many free computers people can find

1082
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,120
In fact, it was such a thing. It was such a thing that we would actually start

1083
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,840
going through

1084
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,480
Neighborhoods we started putting together an affidavit that we could get legally signed and presented people so we could say

1085
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,040
Look, we are officially this is our official position on this. We're not begging

1086
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,640
We are taking your old computers cleaning them up and and

1087
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:11,200
Renewing them and giving them to people who don't have computers so that we can close the digital divide in our own country

1088
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:20,400
That is my primary goal with linux and if it if and if a company like red hat says we don't care what our

1089
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:25,040
Distro runs on do you see how offensive that gets to me because that's like red hat saying

1090
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,400
We really don't want to be a part of that

1091
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:35,120
We just want to cater to the enterprise. We don't care about all the linux efforts that are going on all over the world

1092
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:42,560
Uh to put computers and technology in the hands of people who don't have it to take old hardware and breathe new life in it

1093
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:46,400
Because the most pleasurable aha moment that you will ever hear

1094
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,520
Is somebody booting an old computer into windows 98 and I kid you not

1095
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,160
Looking it around at all the old netscape navigator stuff on everything

1096
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:02,240
And installing linux and watching it just cook as a server watching it run

1097
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:08,960
Fine as a server watching it be a hundred percent performant as a server because it's way more powerful than any the even a raspberry pi 4

1098
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,160
Even though it's like 10 year old computer

1099
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,400
So instead of going to the trash heap or to someplace else

1100
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,960
This computer becomes

1101
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:24,880
A new toy and it's now in the corner of the garage or it's plugged in it's like really a slow ethernet

1102
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,840
You know

1103
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,560
And there's that so to me that's when you when you ask whether you should run an apple

1104
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,280
I think you should run on anything and I think the first time that you show somebody

1105
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,240
I mean look if you take away all that ugly gooey

1106
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:47,360
Right you're using a 10 year old computer right now exactly you take away all that ugly gooey stuff and you learn to use the terminal

1107
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,040
You would be blown away and you can run like the fish at max settings

1108
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,240
You know

1109
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:04,560
And if you're using vi you're not going to get any lag at all because it's vi vi's rate is supposed to work on 300 bond

1110
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,080
So, you know all of these things

1111
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,120
make using

1112
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,080
You know computers really fun again

1113
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,920
In fact, if there's one reason to try linux is it makes computing fun again

1114
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,520
Using linux makes computers fun to the right person

1115
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,440
Not everybody wants to use the terminal and see what they can do with all these important

1116
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,240
These kind of people by the way are the kind of people that will like

1117
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:36,560
You know like get a pair of wire cutters and strip down old serial cables and like cause them to control other electronics and shit like that

1118
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,920
And maybe they never did it before but they just want to experiment with that

1119
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,360
That's the kind of person that gets really into this kind of stuff

1120
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,880
Uh working with linux and open stack all day. Oh, you'll have to talk to us about open stack. I actually want to

1121
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,600
Uh open stack is all python unfortunately

1122
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,800
Uh, but I am thinking about learning open stack

1123
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,280
Uh, because I think open stack would be better than something like proxmox for even a home lab

1124
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,760
Uh, and by the way open stack, there's lots and lots of work in open stack

1125
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:09,040
Yeah, if you learn open stack, that's something that's an open source very very open source technology that is

1126
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,520
Um, but apparently they they're really really really bigoted about python

1127
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:22,480
Yeah, tony far reported that that he tried to commit some uh, some add some projects and go to the projects

1128
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
And they were denied because they weren't go

1129
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,000
And when I heard that I was like, oh, I don't know man

1130
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:34,240
I mean they're that into python, you know, they don't want to even consider other languages

1131
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:38,000
So I they're we're kind of on the cusp of a lot of other stuff

1132
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,640
Hey, how's it going south korea?

1133
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,080
Love having you. I love south korea. I cannot wait to go one day

1134
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,720
I want to go to south korea so bad it hurts

1135
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,360
Uh, pythonic is in nature. Yes, that's right. Yeah

1136
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,400
so

1137
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,400
Who bought all the pies?

1138
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,760
Uh, I have a few what did I change my title? Please tell me I did

1139
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,640
Okay, good. I guess I guess I didn't

1140
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,400
I thought I did I did that same thing I did before again

1141
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,800
Uh, I thought I changed the title. I didn't all right. Well, let's let's wrap up the stream here

1142
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,400
Singapore

1143
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,600
fantastic

1144
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,040
Oh, I love rancher desktop rancher, but it's got a problem

1145
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,600
um

1146
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,600
What is the data lake? I have no idea. What is a data lake?

1147
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,560
I am a nerd we talked about that already

1148
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,800
Yeah

1149
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,760
You go back and watch the watch the youtube video when I post it if you wanted a data lake is a centralized repository

1150
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,000
That allows you to store all your structure on structure data at scale

1151
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,960
You can store your data as is having to first structure the data

1152
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,600
Yeah

1153
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:51,280
I'm not a I'm not a fan of data lakes. Uh, you got it fair. I've been a relational database person my whole life

1154
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,520
Uh, if you look at like mongo db and a bunch of people that have tried to do object databases

1155
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,320
And you you see them fall on their face and end up, uh, deploying a relational database later

1156
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,360
Uh, you'll see the problem. I think you should start with relational relational database up front

1157
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,880
Uh, if you need a database if you don't need a database, you might be fine with just files actually

1158
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,520
Uh, I know that's heresy to say it, but um

1159
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,200
Yeah, I but I'm not I'm not a fan of that

1160
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,920
Uh, so yeah

1161
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,160
Corporate yes

1162
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:28,560
What do I think of web 3? I hate it. Uh, web 3 is disastrously poorly designed. Uh, it's horribly over engineered

1163
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,280
By extremely intelligent people who have no practical sense whatsoever

1164
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:39,840
And these are my worst type of technologists if I detect that type of technologist

1165
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:45,440
In real life, whether I'm working with them or I see them at a conference or at a pub

1166
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,640
I will do everything in my power to get out of the room and go somewhere far away from them

1167
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,880
Because yeah, SQLite exactly so

1168
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,440
um

1169
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,280
People who don't understand why web 3 is a bad idea

1170
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:07,520
Uh, are not thinking in practical terms. I I absolutely despise

1171
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,640
Engineers who are not practical

1172
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:17,600
Who do things because they can who like to pick technology because it's cool and because it's complex

1173
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,960
I despise technology for technology's sake

1174
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,960
um

1175
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,800
Yeah, I'll go swing in a hammock. I will this I

1176
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:33,600
Technology is serves one purpose of one purpose only and that is to enable life to

1177
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,520
be better

1178
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,520
and to go on and to

1179
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:44,720
You know and create harmony in the universe and and all of those things and any technology that just tracks from that

1180
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,760
Uh, especially if it's claiming to do that and it fails to hypocritically

1181
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,640
Uh, I don't want nothing to do with it and that's web 3

1182
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,320
As web 3 that's NFTs. That's any of the crypto stuff

1183
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:03,600
Uh, am I opposed to people exploring the realm and see if it's a good way to secure exchanges between banks and stuff?

1184
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
possibly, uh

1185
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,080
I I'm just I'm just tired of

1186
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,400
of

1187
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:18,240
Impractical people applying their extremely intelligent brains to things and coming up with shit that makes no sense at all

1188
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,760
Uh, and by the way html was a bad idea myself, too

1189
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,080
I think html was a bad idea and to a lesser degree html was exactly this problem

1190
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,360
Markdown was plenty fine

1191
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,400
Why didn't they use it markdown was invented by writers

1192
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,920
Who wanted something practical html was invented by scientists

1193
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,360
So they immediately went to the other scientists and they said hey scientists

1194
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,440
Uh, what are you already using for like managing like data and stuff?

1195
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:55,120
We're using this sgml thing with some big ass acronym that doesn't make any sense to anybody and make some sound really important

1196
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:01,360
No markdown did not exist if it had in fact the knowledge exchange grid that I want to make

1197
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,120
Is markdown and Hugo's markdown, right?

1198
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Yeah, Hugo's Hugo's a go tech

1199
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,280
so

1200
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,560
Markdown is relatively, you know, uh, by the way erin schwarz

1201
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,720
Uh, and uh, John Gruber made markdown John Gruber still has

1202
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,280
Uh, I think John Gruber has been he's so much of a writer and a podcaster

1203
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,120
They asked him a jgm who made pandog invited him

1204
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,040
to be in a you know involved and he's like nah

1205
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,320
And so jgms lost was like trying to document mark out good

1206
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:42,080
If you go read the itf rfc's on markdown, it's hilarious because there's no official markdown

1207
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,240
Specification at all and so they tried to come up with one and jgm was left

1208
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:51,840
This berkeley guy was left to come up with you know as close as he could come up with with a standard because markdown as

1209
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,640
Defined in the pearl script that jong made that erin helped him make by the way erin schwarz

1210
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,200
God knows he's one of my favorite humans who ever live

1211
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:00,960
um

1212
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,000
You know they they it's got tons of bugs and

1213
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,360
Inconsistency is a specification of jgm and very scientifically. He's like he's a philosophy professor berkeley

1214
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,680
He's like okay. We got to fix this so he gets in there

1215
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,720
And he tries to fix it all and he comes up with as much consensus as he can for common mark

1216
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,480
And he got github to sit at the table and reddit and a couple other people

1217
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:26,000
And they come out with the common mark standard which you know and get a flavor markdown as an extension of it now

1218
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,080
And so that's all been standardized

1219
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,240
But

1220
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:33,600
You know so look there does need to be a scientific approach to it

1221
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:39,920
But I I tell you that story because it's a perfect example of engineers screwing shit up

1222
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,920
They do it all the time

1223
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,200
engineers

1224
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,960
fix problems

1225
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,400
But they also create problems out of thin air

1226
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,600
Because they're engineers

1227
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,120
And I know because I've done it i've done it i've done it so many times

1228
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,800
Raise your hand if you've done it raise your hand if you've over engineered a solution

1229
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,280
And and you're like you come you go get some coffee you come back and you're like and you look at it you're like

1230
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,600
You mean I could oh my god or or here's a here's a better one. Here's a better one your wife, right?

1231
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:16,960
You're like you're like you're like going for a walk and you don't have a twitch stream to torment with all of your ideas, right?

1232
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,360
Yeah, and you're like and you're and you're talking to your you know you're talking

1233
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,400
You're like tormenting your wife with like technical knowledge, right?

1234
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,120
It's just trying really hard because she loves you to understand what you're saying

1235
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,360
And she's trying to follow you because she loves you and you try to follow her art stuff and everything

1236
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,480
And and out of nowhere. She says well, what if you did this?

1237
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,120
I mean, I mean she's like, you know, I'm not a techie or anything

1238
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,200
But what if I just what if you just did that instead and you're like, oh my god

1239
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,080
You're a genius

1240
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,880
Oh

1241
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,880
Yeah, you know it's like

1242
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,320
So uh-oh you're gonna come in and comment on that

1243
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,280
I'm I'm just wrapping up. I was just telling him how you have to have somebody who asked why are you doing it that way?

1244
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,400
Ooh beef uncured hot dogs

1245
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,920
Mark wallberg is making hot dogs now. He has a whole restaurant thing going on. Okay

1246
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,800
Can you turn the last thing?

1247
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,800
Well, actually I need to talk about tech

1248
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,480
How many things is that break? Why does this why couldn't this just be simple?

1249
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,840
Why did I have to make my documentation website use javascript?

1250
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,280
IBM I post that on twitter today

1251
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,240
Seriously, all of all of IBM's documentation site requires javascript to read it. Ask yourself

1252
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,280
How come that's a bad idea?

1253
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,040
So

1254
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,000
So

1255
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,880
Web three to me and I did answer the question. What do you think of web three?

1256
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,520
I think web three is the epitome

1257
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,240
It's like if you took all the people if you took

1258
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,880
Like like the whole rick and morty idea where you can separate the toxic cells from the good self, you know

1259
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,120
If you were to take all of the toxic

1260
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:58,320
Overengineers self from every engineer and you were to put that in a big vat of actual, you know goo in rick and morty style

1261
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:03,920
And you were like have it like take on some sort of like nebulous form that could communicate

1262
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,160
It would create web three

1263
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:12,480
Because that's what it is web three is the absolute worst possible

1264
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,240
design from the most over engineered

1265
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,120
impractical

1266
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:24,320
Frankly idiotic perspective you could ever imagine and and I that's all I have to say about that

1267
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,520
It makes me really happy that

1268
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,640
At least I have my feet on the ground and that sometimes I'm actually happy that I'm dumb

1269
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,720
Compared to some of these other engineers because it causes me to think things through more

1270
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,760
I I can't you know spit out, you know

1271
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:45,200
Uh complexity theory algorithms or do land to calculus, you know at lunch. I'm not that guy. I can't do that. So

1272
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,720
I'm glad sometimes because it keeps my feet on the ground and it makes me think through things

1273
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:56,080
Um and and think and ask questions like why are all these dashes in all of our command lines?

1274
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,960
Get off get off this as a good example of over engineered crap

1275
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:07,840
You know when somebody created a a user interface that was an engineer is like we'll put one dash here for this

1276
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,160
We'll put two dashes here. We'll allow colon for this

1277
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,280
And that's why I made bonsai because I am a practical person

1278
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,720
I don't like when people over engineer stuff and one of the most over-engineered things ever is get-up. So

1279
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,200
That's a little rant about that. Um

1280
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:26,960
No experience with snort and nips or nids. I wish I did. I'm super sorry. I can't talk about that

1281
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,040
Uh

1282
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:34,080
This is just the whole idea of looking at logs all the time and studying those and combining them all

1283
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,840
That's been around since the days of like, um centralized, um

1284
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:46,320
Uh system log, uh daemons, but it's still a thing. I still think it should be done. Um, what is nips

1285
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,280
I don't know what nips is

1286
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,280
network intrusion detection system

1287
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:56,880
Umbrella term for combination of hardware and software. That's cool. I like the concept from what I understand of it

1288
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,080
Um

1289
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,680
Is the system that attempts to detect hacking activities to now have service attacks

1290
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:08,080
I think these things are cool. I really do. Uh, I don't have anything

1291
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:13,680
I don't my is just old school tripwire. We would just like check some every file on the whole system make

1292
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,320
lists of of um

1293
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,560
Exceptions and then watch for things to change

1294
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,720
Uh security is actually a lot simpler than most people make it out to be

1295
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,960
Kind of in that practical sense

1296
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,800
all you really have to do to ensure a system is secure is track everything on the system and tell you when anything changes

1297
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,040
You don't have to have fancy signatures

1298
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:37,120
It can be gotten around by compiling the same malware and go that was in c before

1299
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:41,200
You don't have if you just look for things on the system that are regularly changed

1300
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,440
And and create ways to detect those changes in the system

1301
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,560
Uh and report on them that that is the number blue one blue team approach that I think everybody should be doing

1302
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,200
And I don't know that's how I caught the hacker who invaded my computer at home back when I set up my own mail server

1303
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,760
Um, and that's how everybody

1304
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,880
It should be doing it. I don't understand why it's so so hard

1305
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,520
Uh the defender defeater

1306
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,120
Yeah

1307
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:11,600
What is eldep and I should use it so eldep is a lightweight directory access protocol. This is uh something came from the 90s that was used to

1308
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,720
Uh put group information for corporations and stuff and it is still used a lot. Um, it's used in

1309
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,680
We've talked about it before we talked about it with uh, I want to say hayden

1310
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:30,160
And uh with free IPA and some things like that. It's built into active directory now as of may as of may 2022

1311
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,120
Um, and it's the way that you get group permissions

1312
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,400
Once a person authenticates to see if they can do things if you can authorize them to do different things

1313
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:42,480
Uh, I think everybody should use it. It should be a part of your system

1314
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:49,520
Uh in your identity management and how you do things. Uh, we will be putting open eldep on my lab here

1315
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,680
Um, probably in the form of free IPA. Although I'm

1316
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:58,560
I'm a little bit leery of free IPA now now that I've been looking back at nis, which is really old tech

1317
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,640
Uh, but I want to see if there's something related to that before I make a decision right now

1318
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:09,040
I'm just doing localized logins on everything and which is more zero trustee because it does use search for all that

1319
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,480
Uh eldep is not a windows thing. No eldep is getting if you do a search for eldep

1320
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,120
You're going to get a lot of hits for azure and active directory these days because that's usually where people are run

1321
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,560
Or they're deploying it. Uh, but it's actually way older than that

1322
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,680
Yeah on linux, it comes. Yeah, linux eldep has kerberos built into it

1323
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,880
Kerberos is the name of the three headed dog

1324
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,920
Greek dog that was guarding whatever and

1325
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:41,760
Is mit technology designed to do password authentication without ever sending passwords over the over the wire

1326
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,320
By exchanging data that's been signed using public key cryptography

1327
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,800
So kerberos is the standard. Uh, even if you're not using it outright

1328
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:58,160
You're using it inside of other things. It's kerberos is is built into pam for example and linux se and

1329
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:01,360
And eldep and everything else. It's just not always front in the center

1330
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,360
Uh, yeah the tickets that nobody really understands exactly

1331
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:12,640
Uh, if you're familiar with wire shark, you can be familiar. Yep. It's another one. Yeah, and you can watch eldep over the wire too. Um

1332
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,240
These days eldep is secured and you know over encrypted connections, but not always

1333
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:23,760
Um, but most of the time these days eldep is used to give information about an account

1334
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,840
Uh regarding, you know, what things this authorized to do and what it can do

1335
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,400
Uh roles will say role-based authentication. I mean authorization

1336
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:39,200
Um, but it and it can be used for authentication the first part that says i am me

1337
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,520
Uh, but that i am me thing, uh, is now

1338
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:48,480
Taking place elsewhere in kerberos and other things that are um

1339
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
And then eldep is provides the other data

1340
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,760
They get that right

1341
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:59,200
Uh, it's still useful and not over engineered. I think public key cryptography is not at over engineered at all

1342
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,000
I think I think it's actually the only natural way to do it

1343
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,240
Um

1344
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:07,680
Uh, it's the other things you call smart are harmful. No, absolutely not

1345
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:12,160
No, and there are some things that have to be complex cryptography is one of those things

1346
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,520
Um, and I you know and I accept that right? Uh, I I don't think cryptography can be

1347
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:22,320
Although I mean you can make the argument that some of the cryptographic algorithms failed because of over engineering

1348
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,480
If you I I'm not going to get into it

1349
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:32,240
But if you like short like the failure of blowfish or rsa or any of the other ones that are no longer officially good, you know

1350
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:39,520
Uh, you might you know uncover the fact that somebody was getting really clever and their cleverness ended up being their downfall

1351
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,160
um

1352
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,120
But you know, we do need cleverness. Don't get me wrong. So I yeah

1353
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:50,720
Uh, does does how to I mean my favorite xkcd about this is

1354
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:57,040
Uh, you guys know the xkcd about the password thing. It's a perfect example of this over engineering concept

1355
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:01,760
That seems to be the theme today. Um, does anybody have a link to it? I'll go find it xkcd

1356
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,160
Uh password. It's it's one of the most popular pass rots

1357
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:12,800
Here it here it is, right? Wait. Oh troubadour common substitutions. You're risk

1358
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,160
No, that's not it. Where is it?

1359
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,720
That's not it

1360
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,360
Any enigma

1361
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:24,240
Too coffee just enough to use it effectively. Yes, it was

1362
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,880
um

1363
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,880
Dang it

1364
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,120
Where's the one you guys know what I'm talking about?

1365
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,640
password

1366
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,960
Uh pass rod actually pass for encryption

1367
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:43,760
If you know what it's the next kcd about the encryption thing

1368
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,480
I'm trying to find it. I can't it's taking me forever because I'm slow

1369
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,440
Or is it you just have to look for a club

1370
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,360
Yes

1371
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,480
Or is it I love it. I love it. I can't find it

1372
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:08,240
I'm gonna I'm gonna spend all day trying to find it if I can't find it. You guys can try to help me find it

1373
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,320
It's the one where he talks about his algorithm

1374
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:21,680
Uh for defeating defeat cryptography how to defeat

1375
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,800
Uh password cryptography

1376
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,520
Ah

1377
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,120
It's actually it's actually a joke about it and and and mr. Robot

1378
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,360
Oh, here it is. Yeah, this is the one

1379
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,720
Okay, so

1380
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,720
Here we go

1381
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,720
A crypto a crypto nerd's imagination

1382
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:54,400
His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a multi-million dollar cluster to crack it. No good. It's 40 96 bit rsa encrypted

1383
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,800
Blast our evil plan is foiled

1384
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:03,680
What would actually happen his laptop's encrypted drug him and hit him with the five dollar wrench until he tells us the password

1385
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Got it

1386
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:13,760
This this is my favorite because this is exactly how

1387
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:20,400
This is engineers over here, right? And this is like practical dumb people

1388
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:25,280
Threat models are a thing they are a thing

1389
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,240
you know and

1390
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:33,920
You know, it's like you spend like multi-billion dollars on the door and the wall next to it is two by fours and drywall

1391
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,920
You know

1392
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,760
It's like

1393
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:45,040
But then they don't think about it. This is this is a pretty common meme out there. By the way, they're not dumb, right?

1394
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,320
Uh, they're not so you see engineers

1395
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,880
Yeah, I mean

1396
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,480
you know, it's

1397
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,480
And I think that this problem comes about because people overthink

1398
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,960
Uh

1399
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,760
The technology either because it's exciting to them because they really get off on mathematics or something or

1400
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,960
Some other reason I don't know why but they they don't accidentally lock

1401
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:13,040
ZQ says accidentally locked my keys inside a calm closet today

1402
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,960
Then I realized the door was on backwards. So I just took a piece of metal in there and

1403
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,280
I'm probably a vulnerability

1404
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to tell you

1405
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:29,920
Yeah, you know, it's fun. It's it's fun to talk about. It's horrible when I when you experience it

1406
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,240
So as I seems to be kind of the theme today, I hope I hope no one gets overly

1407
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,480
Been out of shape on my picking on engineers

1408
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,720
I am one and I am the first one to tell you that I've made tons and tons of mistakes

1409
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,880
Uh, because I overthought something and some of these projects I threw away

1410
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:50,400
Do you guys remember that parser that I made where I made my own sco sub language to do all the parsing?

1411
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,800
And I was like, why don't I just like go? I mean, I totally threw the whole thing away

1412
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,280
I threw like three weeks of work

1413
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,080
and an entire

1414
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,040
documented

1415
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:05,200
Subline sub go api for this language that I had created and I chucked it all

1416
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,560
And I I replaced it with like a one rune

1417
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,440
Uh character scanner instead

1418
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,880
And and then code did code generation when necessary and I was like, oh my god. What was I thinking?

1419
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,640
And you know, we're going to go through those times. That's just human progress

1420
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:25,920
But you know and I really shouldn't beat people up for over engineering things until they get like all

1421
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:31,920
You know white towery, you know, ivory tower about it. It's like you're going to use what we give you and you're going to like it

1422
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,920
And people get like that. I have lose my patience

1423
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,280
uh

1424
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,200
A lot of over engineering actually comes from corporate and management not from mentors themselves. I agree

1425
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,960
Uh, let me give you an example of that one fun one fun. Uh

1426
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,280
Uh, the crypto web three job you experienced it first hand really

1427
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,560
So let me give you an example of that the engineer the management screwing stuff up. Okay

1428
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,160
This is a true story from my buddy brent who worked in the military

1429
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:02,960
I taught him linux, uh, you know back in the day

1430
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,920
He had taught me salaris and he was kind of my mentor. I was the first official system of a job I had

1431
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,880
I had been doing web development. I was like his webmaster before that

1432
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,120
This was my first actual job, you know managing salaris and aix and everything

1433
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,720
and

1434
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:23,120
He told me a story once that we used to play chess and and and eat and talk stories because it's just a big job

1435
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,040
Uh

1436
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,800
At lunch and he told me the story once about how it's and I've told the story before his senior officer

1437
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,760
Uh, he he did all the work to spec out a salaris, uh server

1438
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:40,240
And he got the best one possible for the job and it cost like 20 50 000. It was like really spending

1439
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,040
Um, but it was small

1440
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,600
And if you know anything about technology, you know that if you want small you pay more money

1441
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,280
Right

1442
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:54,160
And so, I mean it was barely the size of like a for you tower today, right?

1443
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,200
But uh, we do have questions but not right now

1444
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,120
We're about out of time

1445
01:39:59,120 --> 01:39:59,840
We are out of time

1446
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,400
But if you want to you can give me a question we can put in for tomorrow

1447
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:07,680
Or you can come on in and leave the questions in our discord in the questions conversations and advice channel

1448
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:13,360
Economy of scale, right? So so, I mean everybody in the it world knows that

1449
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,600
Smallest better

1450
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,600
You know if you can keep the heat down everything

1451
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:24,240
So no joke his senior officer said I have my commanding officer is coming in i'm giving him a tour

1452
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:28,480
And that will not do they're going to be here in two weeks. You need to do something about this news

1453
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,480
Like what do you want me to do?

1454
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,120
And he's like, I don't know it just needs to be bigger

1455
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,480
Very male american military thing to say

1456
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,200
And he said, uh

1457
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,080
Well, we could get a rack for it and we could get it like a we could get like a

1458
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,760
We could get like a rack for it like a like a 42 u rack for it and put it in that

1459
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,560
He goes is that bigger and he's like, well, yeah

1460
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,680
I mean that would be like, you know 13 feet in the air and you just put the in there and we just close the door on it

1461
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And he's like I want that

1462
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,560
I

1463
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:04,720
Want that

1464
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:08,080
His senior officer no kidding his senior officer

1465
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:15,840
Commanded him to spend an extra 300 dollars like a delrack or whatever to put his like

1466
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,480
four five u server in that cost like 20 50 thousand dollars

1467
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,520
And you know, he's like, okay

1468
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,240
I'm sure it was and you know, we were just riffing and he was like, oh, you know, I can put some lights on it

1469
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,040
I

1470
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,640
Yeah, it's the kind of outlets suspension on step 150. I know

1471
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:43,200
You know when he got victorious like see this is our new computer, which we just which we just purchased, you know

1472
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,000
And brent's been here brent's been instrumental in getting the server for us in front of brent

1473
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:52,160
I just love brent brent. I I wish I could get brent on the stream

1474
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,040
brent is the most

1475
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,200
Stoic human being I have ever known

1476
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,320
He's hilarious. He's so hilarious. He never cracks jokes. He's just really smart

1477
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:07,280
I I can see his mustached face today. He's the kind of guy

1478
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Who just doesn't talk

1479
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:15,520
But when he does say stuff, it's really funny. It's really interesting and I just I will never forget that story

1480
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,920
I miss him so much. He was such a great

1481
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:22,000
I mean, I know, you know, it's hard to you know, you you get people that you work with that are great friends

1482
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:27,680
And I I just really I really miss having having him around and and letting me like transom and and

1483
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:31,680
