WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
So where did SteelStock beginner boosts go?

00:02.800 --> 00:05.600
That was the thing we were doing to get started.

00:05.600 --> 00:09.840
The quick answer is it got moved.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.840
And it was still gonna start something on May the 4th,

00:11.840 --> 00:16.840
but so the overall focus is now gonna be on, you know,

00:22.400 --> 00:27.200
content that, in fact, let me see

00:27.200 --> 00:29.880
if I can go find my whiteboard here.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.280
Here we go, Unix infrastructure engineer.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.960
So it's gonna be called the Unix beginner boost

00:33.960 --> 00:36.000
probably next year, but there's a good chance

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I'm gonna change the name of all of those boosts

00:39.000 --> 00:40.520
to match the name to the books that I'm writing

00:40.520 --> 00:41.560
that I'm starting to write right now

00:41.560 --> 00:44.440
and I'm obsessed with writing.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.000
So the first book we're gonna write is

00:46.000 --> 00:48.480
Mastering Terminal Velocity,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.080
Mastering the Fastest Human-Commuter Interface,

00:51.080 --> 00:52.840
which has everything from the beginner boosts

00:52.840 --> 00:55.640
and you've probably seen me writing on it every day.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.880
You can go look it up actually at github.com

00:59.880 --> 01:02.640
slash, I mean, Rob, slash book.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.840
And I've already covered this,

01:03.840 --> 01:06.040
but you can go watch another video on this.

01:07.080 --> 01:12.080
And we're gonna go back to this kind of thing.

01:16.120 --> 01:21.120
And so that's what's happened to the boost, it's changed.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.200
So most of the people that are interested in this

01:25.200 --> 01:26.600
are interested in the Go coding

01:26.600 --> 01:28.240
that they were learning at the boost.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.760
We already decided a couple of weeks ago

01:29.760 --> 01:34.200
that the Go coding in the boost is too hard for beginners

01:34.200 --> 01:35.560
so who don't know how to code.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.680
So we assume that you have had some Python

01:41.240 --> 01:44.120
as your first language and or hopefully something else.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.240
I mean, Python's a great first language for coders.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.160
I mean, everybody knows this,

01:49.160 --> 01:50.680
even I might not be my favorite,

01:50.680 --> 01:52.400
but it doesn't matter, it's still the best one.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.560
So my, if you're wondering what to do with the boost

01:55.560 --> 01:58.280
and now all the rest of the content

01:58.280 --> 01:59.120
from the beginner boost,

01:59.120 --> 02:00.840
the terminal related stuff is covered.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.800
I mean, we covered it all.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.160
The only other things from previous years

02:04.160 --> 02:06.200
that I covered in the boost,

02:06.200 --> 02:09.640
skill stack related things were things like,

02:09.640 --> 02:12.080
how to get ready for a job

02:12.080 --> 02:15.040
and how to put yourself out there and stuff.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.760
But mostly the beginner boost has always been about

02:17.760 --> 02:19.480
becoming, mastering the terminal.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.080
And that has got really clear boundaries now

02:23.080 --> 02:24.640
so that we have boosts for everything

02:24.640 --> 02:27.000
so we don't have this overlap.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.640
So, this is my last take on what you should probably learn

02:31.640 --> 02:33.200
in that way, what order.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.440
And you can go look at this up.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.440
This is in my bout or you can just come ask me.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.200
And so you go with the Unix beginner boost,

02:41.200 --> 02:43.160
which is pretty much just the terminal

02:43.160 --> 02:45.240
and then becoming a pressure technology professional,

02:45.240 --> 02:47.520
which is all the stuff related to how to get a job

02:47.520 --> 02:49.000
and network and all that stuff.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.680
That needs to be its own series.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.440
And frankly, it needs to be its own book.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.600
I don't know if that'll be the name,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.640
but that'll be it.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.800
And so I'm really emphasizing strongly

02:58.800 --> 03:00.440
that there will be books created

03:00.440 --> 03:03.600
to go with each of these boosts.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.320
And so the first one I'm really obsessed with

03:05.320 --> 03:07.080
and that's what I'm gonna be writing all day today

03:07.080 --> 03:12.080
is gonna be the keg ML parsers

03:12.720 --> 03:14.880
so that we can start writing the book

03:16.320 --> 03:18.320
and publishing it and getting as close

03:18.320 --> 03:20.600
as we can to publishing the terminal velocity book.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.480
And when I say publish, I mean really publish.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.040
I mean paper version, no starch press,

03:26.600 --> 03:27.440
Amazon all that.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.800
And I talk about that in another question.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.680
So if you wanna know what to do,

03:30.680 --> 03:32.520
if you're like, what happened to skill stack boosts?

03:32.520 --> 03:33.720
I don't know what to do now.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.280
Go learn Python.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.480
There are so many ways to learn Python.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.720
I just found a new book about how to learn Python,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.520
which I'll talk about in another time.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.440
It's really good actually.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.320
There's a number of really, really great resources

03:44.320 --> 03:45.480
for learning Python.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.560
I don't need to cover that at all.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.560
It's completely covered by the industry.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.800
Learning the terminal is not.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.760
So I'm gonna focus on the things that need help.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.200
Learning go as a beginner is not covered very much.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.120
There is a little bit of it.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.520
There's learning go, which assumes that you know

03:59.520 --> 04:01.080
how to code already and know a little bit of go,

04:01.080 --> 04:04.160
but it doesn't, you know, and it's a good resource.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.560
It is, it's a pretty damn good resource.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.200
So I'm gonna let people go to that

04:08.200 --> 04:09.440
if they wanna learn that.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.320
And the people that have been with me on the boost

04:11.320 --> 04:13.520
on Saturdays since we started doing co-programming

04:13.520 --> 04:14.440
are wanting to learn go.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.540
So there's gonna be tons of go programming,

04:16.540 --> 04:18.260
but from now until January,

04:18.260 --> 04:21.300
because I'm writing the parser and then, you know,

04:21.300 --> 04:23.620
all this stuff for keg, and that's all gonna be in go.

04:23.620 --> 04:27.820
So if you already know how to program

04:27.820 --> 04:32.820
and you want to increase your go skills,

04:33.860 --> 04:36.420
you can still come in and check in at boost time

04:36.420 --> 04:37.940
and you'll be seeing me writing

04:37.940 --> 04:39.540
and mostly coding in go, right?

04:39.540 --> 04:41.220
We're gonna be doing a lot of Kubernetes stuff as well,

04:41.220 --> 04:42.460
but that's generally during the week,

04:42.460 --> 04:43.960
not necessarily on Saturdays.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.940
So I do plan on keeping Saturday

04:45.940 --> 04:50.020
dedicated to writing, you know, keg-related go code

04:50.860 --> 04:55.020
and potentially, you know, a book related to go of my own,

04:56.020 --> 04:57.540
but that's secondary to getting

04:57.540 --> 05:00.900
the terminal velocity book done.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.620
And then, so that's pretty much it.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.460
That's what's happened.

05:05.460 --> 05:06.740
If you wanna know what to do next,

05:06.740 --> 05:09.500
you know, learn how to write your first program in Python,

05:09.500 --> 05:10.380
go programming fundamentals.

05:10.380 --> 05:11.580
At the same time, you can also learn

05:11.580 --> 05:15.060
how to create containers, OCI containers,

05:15.060 --> 05:17.260
you know, with PODMAT or Docker,

05:17.260 --> 05:19.320
learn how to run local Kubernetes.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.100
You could probably also learn

05:22.100 --> 05:23.260
how to build your own desktop PC,

05:23.260 --> 05:24.700
set up a Linux server.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.460
This is also stuff that we're doing differently.

05:26.460 --> 05:31.460
So the boost is not going to be the same next year.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.860
So I'm just gonna say it right now.

05:34.860 --> 05:38.100
So we still will have the tradition of starting something,

05:38.100 --> 05:43.100
probably the terminal velocity boost on May the 4th.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.900
But it's not gonna be called beginner boost anymore.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.460
It's gonna be called whatever

05:49.460 --> 05:52.020
should match the book title that it goes with.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.460
And I won't be having any boost

05:53.460 --> 05:55.780
that does not have a book written for it already.

05:55.780 --> 05:58.340
So this is just something I'm really seriously going

05:58.340 --> 06:00.620
to force myself to do over the next year.

06:00.620 --> 06:01.980
I mean, I change my mind all the time,

06:01.980 --> 06:04.620
but that is something that has plagued me

06:04.620 --> 06:09.140
since the beginning because I am kind of loosey-goosey

06:09.140 --> 06:09.980
in how I do it.

06:09.980 --> 06:11.180
I know what my outline is and everything,

06:11.180 --> 06:13.060
but there's nothing to show for it

06:13.060 --> 06:14.340
after that other than the videos.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.180
And then people are like,

06:15.180 --> 06:16.020
well, how do I get through the videos?

06:16.020 --> 06:17.100
And they have a rough outline.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.220
If they have a book to go through,

06:19.220 --> 06:21.500
like an actual book that I can update week to week

06:21.500 --> 06:24.820
if I have to, and that's why I'm so interested in Keg

06:24.820 --> 06:26.180
because Keg will allow that

06:26.180 --> 06:28.580
other than printing something that's out of date next week.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.340
Keg will allow me to have people

06:31.340 --> 06:33.780
get the latest version of the book every week if they want

06:33.780 --> 06:36.500
and contribute and add whatever.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.380
So that is gonna happen.

06:40.380 --> 06:45.380
And then, so the most likely possibility for next year

06:46.180 --> 06:50.080
on May the 4th will be a link to this map.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.100
Yeah, I have links to all the maps in my description.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.740
At least I will.

06:53.740 --> 06:56.200
If I don't have it yet, I will get you,

06:57.220 --> 06:58.060
I'll get all of this stuff.

06:58.060 --> 07:01.500
This stuff is all kind of like my free form thinking

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
about different things.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.020
And there's no way to link to all of my stuff.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.260
So I will be making a resource

07:08.260 --> 07:10.100
to link to these different whiteboards

07:10.100 --> 07:11.940
that I have, I have a lot of them.

07:11.940 --> 07:14.460
And the whiteboards are gonna be based on

07:14.460 --> 07:15.700
general topics and stuff like that.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.300
The Home Lab and then it's another thing to do.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.820
So what's happened to the beginner boost in a nutshell

07:20.820 --> 07:22.660
is that it's gotten more specific

07:22.660 --> 07:25.820
and it's kind of fractured into a lot

07:25.820 --> 07:27.140
of other specific things

07:28.300 --> 07:32.180
for which there will always be a book, a guide

07:32.180 --> 07:34.140
or some publication from now on.

07:34.140 --> 07:37.700
So I know that sounds ambitious for me to do that,

07:37.700 --> 07:41.580
but I've always wanted to do this and it's time to do it.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.220
And keg needs to be built.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.140
It's actually more important

07:44.140 --> 07:45.700
than even covering a boost every year

07:45.700 --> 07:46.940
is making sure I get keg finished

07:46.940 --> 07:49.220
so people can start building the knowledge exchange

07:49.220 --> 07:53.260
or the keg network of, you know,

07:53.260 --> 07:54.600
and share their knowledge and stuff like that.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.260
So this, when we do it next year,

07:57.260 --> 07:59.820
it'll be probably called the terminal velocity boost

07:59.820 --> 08:03.060
and which is fine, you know, terminal velocity boost

08:03.060 --> 08:04.980
and it will be like, what is that about?

08:04.980 --> 08:07.500
And it'll be getting you fast on the terminal.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.460
It will not include installing Linux at all.

08:10.460 --> 08:14.500
It will include using bash as fast as possible.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.940
And then there will be different boosts

08:17.940 --> 08:21.100
if you wanna call them that or sessions or series

08:21.100 --> 08:24.180
or whatever about how to get Unix.

08:24.180 --> 08:27.220
And I'm talking about Unix, not just the center of Linux.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.660
If you, you know, we're gonna go through, you know,

08:29.660 --> 08:34.180
we'll have multiple series, you know, segments

08:34.180 --> 08:35.580
about how to get Linux.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.060
Because there's just, I mean, how to get Unix.

08:37.060 --> 08:39.140
There's so many different ways to do Unix.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.940
And in fact, I've always wanted to cover those things,

08:40.940 --> 08:42.660
including, you know, installing on hardware,

08:42.660 --> 08:43.500
which we can cover now

08:43.500 --> 08:45.260
because I have a capture card that'll do it.

08:45.260 --> 08:47.620
And again, those are all topics

08:47.620 --> 08:49.620
that are covered a lot elsewhere.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.020
What's not covered is, again,

08:51.020 --> 08:52.740
the very specific thing about how to get fast

08:52.740 --> 08:53.860
with the terminal.

08:53.860 --> 08:57.900
And so that's my number one priority,

08:57.900 --> 09:00.420
finish that book first and do the rest.

09:00.420 --> 09:04.700
So the content from the boost is still there.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.620
And the go programming, if that's what you want,

09:07.620 --> 09:09.180
or, you know, the terminal stuff.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.060
This isn't gonna be writing the book every day

09:11.060 --> 09:12.180
or something about the book.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.540
You'll be able to get that any time.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.460
And then you can always go back to the videos.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.380
And then what will end up happening

09:18.380 --> 09:21.460
is the videos that go with for the boost

09:21.460 --> 09:24.740
will get more and more polished every year.

09:24.740 --> 09:27.580
And they'll become more segmented.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.820
And eventually, probably,

09:30.820 --> 09:32.540
they'll turn into Udemy courses,

09:32.540 --> 09:34.740
which will be an option.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.900
You won't have to do Udemy.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.660
But if you want to do Udemy, you can.

09:38.660 --> 09:41.700
Otherwise, you can, like, slog through the unedited video
