WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.020
to start recording.

00:02.020 --> 00:03.720
What are your thoughts on chat, GPT?

00:05.520 --> 00:07.640
So here's the thing.

00:09.720 --> 00:10.560
Why?

00:12.800 --> 00:14.560
That's what I have to say.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.560
Why are people interested in this?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.120
I just don't get it.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.320
I just don't get it.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.240
I have watched all this stuff.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.880
I don't understand what its purpose is.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.040
Personally, I mean, let's go back and read it, okay?

00:35.040 --> 00:35.880
So it says here,

00:35.880 --> 00:39.400
chat GPT is a prototype artificial intelligence chat bot.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.360
Join the club.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.960
I mean, how many other chat bots have we had?

00:41.960 --> 00:44.000
Okay, so maybe this was not going to become

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
like a masochistic, narcissistic Nazi

00:47.000 --> 00:48.560
like the Twitter bot before.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.100
This is apparently really polite.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.720
I'm sure they trained it to be really, really polite.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.680
Apparently it's really, really polite.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.240
I was scrolling through a thing and it said,

00:57.240 --> 01:01.480
the most polite, clueless bot you'll ever see.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.000
If it's wrong, at least it's wrong politely.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.120
Hopefully it focuses on usability and dialogue.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.280
The chat bot uses a large language model trained

01:10.280 --> 01:11.440
with reinforcement learning

01:11.440 --> 01:13.160
and it's based on GPT 3.5 architecture.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.320
It's also beta, by the way.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.920
It's not final, right?

01:18.800 --> 01:22.080
It's an open prototype,

01:23.080 --> 01:27.920
not finished.

01:27.920 --> 01:28.760
How about that?

01:28.760 --> 01:30.240
So I'll put that there.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.440
Look, if you want to use it, that's fine.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.320
I am not going to judge you.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.680
I just think it's a waste of time.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.840
So many things are a waste of time today.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.760
And to me, that's a waste of time.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.840
Chat bot uses like,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.880
it says here chat GPT was launched in November, 2022

01:43.880 --> 01:47.080
and is garnered attention as its detailed responses

01:47.080 --> 01:48.120
and well-reasoned answers,

01:48.120 --> 01:50.080
although its accuracy has been criticized.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.440
Well-reasoned wrong answers.

01:55.440 --> 02:00.440
And people are like, I mean, there was an entire article

02:03.960 --> 02:04.880
that came across my feed.

02:04.880 --> 02:09.240
It was like, oh, this is the end of essays as we know them.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.400
It's had GPT, GPT going to destroy, you know,

02:12.400 --> 02:15.120
scholastic achievement through essay writing and stuff.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.880
I'm like, no, it's not.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.240
It's not.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.840
It's not.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.280
I mean, it might help you a little bit.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.480
It's like, it's all of these chat bot things,

02:23.480 --> 02:25.160
including the coding one,

02:25.160 --> 02:27.720
all they really are is they're catering to people

02:27.720 --> 02:30.840
who are copy pasta people,

02:30.840 --> 02:32.080
copy pasta people,

02:32.080 --> 02:36.080
the people who don't do any original thinking

02:36.080 --> 02:39.520
who go out and they want to use this thing like,

02:39.520 --> 02:40.360
oh, that's cool.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.600
They don't actually validate that it's true.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.320
Now, if they did, if they did, if they did,

02:46.320 --> 02:50.000
if they did, then it could be a nice suggestion, right?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.240
And I think that's fine.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.880
And it's not just because I'm old that I don't like it.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.480
It's because it's inaccurate

02:56.480 --> 02:58.400
and it's dangerous to trust an AI

02:58.400 --> 03:01.320
that you're not backing up with personal experience.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.440
This is, do I have to, I mean,

03:02.440 --> 03:05.000
how many fictional sci-fies have there been?

03:06.840 --> 03:08.760
This is part of the evolution of AI, right?

03:08.760 --> 03:10.480
I mean, there was a time, there was a time

03:10.480 --> 03:13.120
when if you were to hear a computer-generated voice,

03:13.120 --> 03:15.040
you would go, what the hell did they say?

03:15.040 --> 03:16.360
And now you can't even tell the difference

03:16.360 --> 03:17.600
between computer-generated voices.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.120
So it's going in the right direction.

03:19.120 --> 03:19.960
I don't have any problem with that.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.400
And it needs to go in the right direction.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.600
But right now, why are you wasting time on it?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.800
And there's an unusually large number of people

03:26.800 --> 03:27.840
coming at me with this.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.520
What do you think of Chad GPT?

03:29.520 --> 03:31.560
Who are college students?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.840
And I had one person in here, I'm gonna get them out of me.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.160
I think they're in here right now, actually.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.560
Please don't get mad.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.320
But they said, all I can say is it took

03:42.320 --> 03:44.160
what was otherwise a three-hour assignment

03:44.160 --> 03:46.360
and turned it into 30 minutes.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.640
That's exactly, that's almost word for word what they said.

03:49.640 --> 03:53.280
And I'm thinking to myself, how is that possible?

03:53.280 --> 03:56.600
How is that possible that this thing,

03:56.600 --> 03:58.400
whether, and I don't know the assignment,

03:58.400 --> 04:00.160
I think it was a coding assignment,

04:00.160 --> 04:05.160
that this thing can, oh wow, there's a good one.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.240
I've come up with a set of rules that describe,

04:07.240 --> 04:11.080
ooh, very cool, a code on a tech rail,

04:11.080 --> 04:12.600
ooh, we'll have to go look at that one, Kima.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
Yeah, that's very cool.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.040
So the point is, if it was taking you three hours

04:18.040 --> 04:19.560
to do an assignment, whatever it was before,

04:19.560 --> 04:21.640
and it's now taking you 30 minutes

04:21.640 --> 04:24.160
because you have a chatbot that's helping you out,

04:25.240 --> 04:26.520
there's something wrong.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.880
I mean, there's something wrong.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.480
You're either not learning it, not learning it properly,

04:31.480 --> 04:34.800
or, I mean, there's an outside chance

04:34.800 --> 04:37.400
that it's doing the grunt work for you

04:37.400 --> 04:38.960
and that you're still doing the learning

04:38.960 --> 04:40.240
and it's filling in all the blanks

04:40.240 --> 04:41.600
and everything that it would take you longer to type,

04:41.600 --> 04:44.040
especially if you're like a slow typer or something.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.000
And I suppose there's a certain number of people

04:46.000 --> 04:48.320
who are slow typers who can't compose thoughts very easily

04:48.360 --> 04:50.120
and it helps them put the language together

04:50.120 --> 04:52.000
and it's like, yeah, okay, that sounds right.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.440
I, this, my fear with any of these AI things

04:56.440 --> 04:59.560
is just like any other fear is it's like,

04:59.560 --> 05:02.160
they're gonna make us soft.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.760
You know, and that's been something

05:03.760 --> 05:05.880
that old people have been saying, you know,

05:05.880 --> 05:06.920
just the dawn of time.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.200
There were people who didn't wanna get on railroad trains

05:09.200 --> 05:10.680
because they thought it was too fast

05:10.680 --> 05:11.760
and everybody was gonna die.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.080
A lot of people did die, by the way.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.240
And there's actually in Arizona, we opened a geocache there

05:16.240 --> 05:18.560
where there were two trains that were on the same track

05:18.560 --> 05:21.360
and there was, you know, hundreds of hundred people

05:21.360 --> 05:23.920
radically destroyed in an instant

05:23.920 --> 05:25.840
when they're two cranes collided at head.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.080
So there are definitely concerns about these things

05:29.080 --> 05:31.120
as they come out and, you know, should we be doing it?

05:31.120 --> 05:32.680
I was like, yes, we should be definitely trying them out

05:32.680 --> 05:36.360
and experimenting and stuff like that, but to what extent?

05:36.360 --> 05:41.360
I mean, you know, if, honestly, this chat,

05:42.800 --> 05:43.800
I don't know about the coding one.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.440
This is just a chat bot, right?

05:45.440 --> 05:46.960
But the coding one, which is kind of related

05:46.960 --> 05:49.680
in conversation, that one will get you fired

05:49.680 --> 05:52.840
from a company if they find out if they're using it.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.920
Not just because you don't know what you're doing,

05:54.920 --> 05:58.920
but because it's been trained on proprietary source code

05:58.920 --> 06:03.920
that has a indeterminate legal pedigree.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.480
And nobody likes to talk about this.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.280
They all like to talk about how cool, you know,

06:08.280 --> 06:12.360
open AI chat is, I mean, this is a different company, right?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.560
That was the Microsoft thing.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.760
It's the code, whatever, I forget the name of it.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.160
But if you're using that, you're actually taking your career

06:18.160 --> 06:20.160
in your own hands and I wouldn't tell anybody you are.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.000
And I think to a lesser degree,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.400
the chat GPT thing is the same thing.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.320
If you, let's say, for example, let's say for example,

06:27.320 --> 06:29.600
that you save three hours on an essay assignment

06:29.600 --> 06:34.600
by using chat GPT, yeah, they'll work out the legal issues

06:35.720 --> 06:37.760
the tech is too powerful not to use.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.000
I don't think that's true at all.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.520
I must say, I know you're a huge AI fan

06:42.520 --> 06:45.240
and I am not, I am not a fan of it at all.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.760
To me, it's just copy, past, past on steroids.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.600
That's all it is.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.080
And so what it's causing is it's causing a bunch of people

06:53.080 --> 06:56.960
to not learn shit and that's fine.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.920
And this, I mean, I've said it before,

06:58.920 --> 07:00.840
I predicted that everybody should be learning AI

07:00.840 --> 07:01.960
and how to train models properly

07:01.960 --> 07:05.200
because if this is a step in the right direction

07:05.200 --> 07:07.080
where the number of people are gonna be doing

07:07.080 --> 07:09.320
actual programming is gonna go down.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.200
And there's a story I tell about this

07:11.200 --> 07:13.520
that is related to this

07:13.520 --> 07:15.560
because the way that AIs are trained,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.560
including this one that I've been slamming on,

07:17.560 --> 07:19.040
the way that they're trained is organic.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.840
It's closer to how nature does things

07:20.840 --> 07:22.640
than the algorithmic models.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.440
And I have a story about this I wanna tell really quick.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.400
Imagine an AI tutor that can teach kids

07:28.400 --> 07:29.600
in third-world countries.

07:30.680 --> 07:35.680
Wrongly, he'll turn them into white supremacists

07:36.320 --> 07:38.240
even though they're in Africa.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.560
I mean, if it was a Twitter bot, that's what it would do.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.880
Look, we're getting there.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.720
We're getting there, we're just not there, right?

07:43.720 --> 07:46.480
So, that's what I'm saying.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.080
Better than what we have right now, which is nothing.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.560
Well, I mean, it's like there's societal ills

07:51.560 --> 07:53.120
out there to look at.

07:53.120 --> 07:58.040
I'm not anti-AI, I'm just like, I'm like,

07:58.040 --> 07:59.920
so on the one hand, I do think we need to learn

07:59.920 --> 08:01.440
how to train models properly.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.360
I just watched a huge conference.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.680
I almost gave up where I work.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.080
There was this huge, huge conference,

08:08.080 --> 08:10.800
a whole day conference about AI at the place that I work.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.800
And it's crazy, it's crazy.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.920
In fact, the whole future of AI and the focus of it

08:15.920 --> 08:19.160
is not even on writing code, it's on the data.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.200
It's on, and they went through a bunch of examples

08:22.200 --> 08:24.000
of how they were sampling the data

08:24.000 --> 08:27.160
and increasing the data samples so that they were good

08:27.160 --> 08:29.600
because the higher the quality and then put data,

08:29.600 --> 08:30.960
the higher the quality of AI.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.440
And you should see the AI's that haven't,

08:32.440 --> 08:34.280
I wish I could talk about it.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.920
The AI that is going down,

08:36.920 --> 08:38.480
because people may not know,

08:38.480 --> 08:40.640
I support a machine learning group.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.080
I do the SRE and the Kubernetes stuff

08:43.080 --> 08:45.720
and some of the REST API development for,

08:45.720 --> 08:49.160
to support high performance computing machine learning group

08:49.160 --> 08:51.720
and one of the biggest companies in the entire world

08:53.040 --> 08:56.120
who's radically making radical advantage,

08:56.120 --> 08:58.360
taking radical advantage of AI and data.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.800
And it's absolutely amazing.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.160
And they have their own, they're so big,

09:01.160 --> 09:03.800
they have actually, they have their annual conference on it.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.120
And I was just there.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.640
And it's absolutely phenomenally awesome.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.360
So either I'm gonna go camping over the week,

09:10.360 --> 09:11.320
over the Christmas break,

09:11.320 --> 09:14.280
I'm actually gonna start sticking my finger into AI

09:14.280 --> 09:16.760
and learning some of the, doing some Kaggle stuff

09:16.760 --> 09:18.520
and learning, if you're not learning

09:18.520 --> 09:22.200
how to do data science and this kind of thing

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
and all you're focused on is algorithmic programming

09:24.200 --> 09:26.360
and stuff, I mean, you should see how long it takes me.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.000
Have you seen, I mean, it takes me forever

09:28.000 --> 09:30.520
to just do basic parsing of a string

09:30.520 --> 09:31.520
or something like that.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.920
I mean, I'm relatively fast,

09:32.960 --> 09:36.720
but the amount of time it takes to write code

09:36.720 --> 09:38.200
compared to the amount of time

09:38.200 --> 09:41.240
that it takes organically to train a model

09:41.240 --> 09:42.520
and to get the data in place

09:42.520 --> 09:46.040
and then let that thing write the code is substantial.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.920
And you know, Masi and others here are saying that,

09:47.920 --> 09:51.480
they're like, this is too powerful for it to not take over.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.480
And the chat GPT is not directly related to the coding thing,

09:55.480 --> 09:56.320
but it's the same idea.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.880
The idea is it'll do the thinking for you

09:57.880 --> 09:59.440
and it'll write your essay for you.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.360
And so, I mean, that's, I just,

10:02.360 --> 10:03.400
on the one side it's good,

10:03.400 --> 10:04.680
on the other side it's really bad.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.360
So let me tell you a story about the good stuff, okay?

10:07.360 --> 10:10.000
So there, I would give anything

10:10.000 --> 10:11.080
for the reference to this yet.

10:11.080 --> 10:15.000
I read this in 2014, I think it was.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.320
And I was studying this philosophical difference

10:19.320 --> 10:23.960
between algorithmic approaches to solutions

10:23.960 --> 10:27.000
and natural organic solutions.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.560
And the specific example was,

10:31.840 --> 10:32.760
and I've told the story before,

10:32.760 --> 10:35.360
but the specific example was a cam.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.080
You know what a cam is, right?

10:37.080 --> 10:39.160
It was a cam, like a camshaft in a car,

10:39.160 --> 10:40.720
but it wasn't a car, it was a factory.

10:40.720 --> 10:45.600
It was a factory in New England someplace in the Northeast.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.200
And, you know, back, you know,

10:48.200 --> 10:49.720
where there's a lot of manufacturing going.

10:49.720 --> 10:53.480
And then the story goes that they,

10:54.560 --> 10:55.960
I wish I could find, if anybody can find it,

10:55.960 --> 10:57.480
please give me a reference.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.920
But the device broke down.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.400
And so the production line was down.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
And this is a production line that was,

11:04.400 --> 11:05.520
you know, core of the business

11:05.520 --> 11:07.280
and they were losing all this money.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.120
And well, every day it was down, they were losing money.

11:10.120 --> 11:14.880
And this cam, it was this very complicated mechanical process

11:14.880 --> 11:18.120
that had to be done exactly that way,

11:18.120 --> 11:20.520
had been created somewhat organically

11:20.520 --> 11:22.600
and it had been tailored and it had been shaved off

11:22.600 --> 11:23.440
and everything.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.360
And so they had to, you know,

11:25.360 --> 11:28.840
they wanted this very unique cam was the core.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.640
It was the heart of everything on the assembly line

11:31.640 --> 11:33.680
and they couldn't recreate it.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.160
And so they hired, they paid all of this money

11:36.160 --> 11:40.280
to all of these people to do, to fix it.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.440
They brought in theorists,

11:41.440 --> 11:45.080
they brought in the Beth Mathematicians, you know,

11:45.080 --> 11:47.240
and they said, okay, hey, let's, you know,

11:47.240 --> 11:50.440
and they designed lots of failures.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.800
So they would put together all these amazing things

11:54.800 --> 11:57.280
and then they didn't work.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.640
They just didn't work

11:58.640 --> 12:00.400
because they weren't organic enough.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.240
They weren't natural enough.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.880
So then they brought in another team

12:03.880 --> 12:06.800
and I don't remember the specifics of the team,

12:06.800 --> 12:08.880
but this team did the same thing.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.800
They recreated the process that was used

12:10.800 --> 12:12.160
to create the first cam.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.440
And it took them longer to do all the stuff,

12:15.440 --> 12:16.400
but it actually worked.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.960
And what they did is they started with something

12:18.960 --> 12:23.640
that was the best approximation of, you know,

12:23.640 --> 12:24.640
that they could come up with

12:24.640 --> 12:25.840
and they used this stuff from, you know,

12:25.840 --> 12:28.280
the other mathematicians that people had given them

12:28.280 --> 12:29.680
and they put that in there

12:29.680 --> 12:31.080
and then they ran it for a while

12:31.080 --> 12:32.040
and then they would go in

12:32.040 --> 12:33.480
and then they would shave, they had the machinist

12:33.480 --> 12:34.840
and they would shave off part of it

12:34.840 --> 12:36.120
and then they would run it again

12:36.120 --> 12:37.600
and then they would shave off a little bit more

12:37.600 --> 12:38.520
and they would run it again.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.960
And then it was, so it was this fail faster idea, right?

12:40.960 --> 12:44.640
And that idea of adjusting for failure

12:44.640 --> 12:46.800
and training a device,

12:46.800 --> 12:49.000
that's exactly how machine learning works.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.240
So as I understand it.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.240
So having that, you know,

12:53.240 --> 12:55.480
and that got them the solution that they wanted to.

12:55.480 --> 13:00.480
And that process of natural learning that went on,

13:01.320 --> 13:04.280
I mean, natural learning has got a very specific meaning

13:04.280 --> 13:05.480
in the AI world.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.200
And that's, I'm sorry, natural intelligence,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.280
not natural learning, natural intelligence is the goal.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.640
Natural intelligence is when the intelligence is self-aware

13:14.640 --> 13:16.120
and everything and there's a lot of debate

13:16.120 --> 13:17.880
about whether that'll ever be a thing.

13:17.880 --> 13:22.080
But the point of it was that the organic approach,

13:22.080 --> 13:24.520
you know, fail and adjust, fail and fix,

13:24.520 --> 13:27.360
fail and fix, fail and fix is what got them the solution.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.920
And no amount of programming and algorithm

13:29.920 --> 13:31.760
at thinking is in the best minds could get it.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.680
It had to be incrementally done.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.720
And I really appreciate that story

13:35.720 --> 13:37.440
because that's how I do most things.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.840
I'm a very practical guy.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.380
I have a hard time, I mean, I can visualize certain things,

13:41.380 --> 13:43.400
but when it comes to like lead code algorithms

13:43.400 --> 13:45.600
and stuff like that, I don't really do well with them.

13:45.600 --> 13:49.520
But if I can see it working, I can modify what's working

13:49.520 --> 13:51.360
and get it to the point where it's working.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.080
And then if I just look at all the code, I'm like,

13:53.080 --> 13:54.840
okay, I understand how this code's working

13:54.840 --> 13:56.600
because I tweaked it all along the way.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.560
And sometimes there's a refactor along the way

13:58.560 --> 14:00.680
in there too, because, you know, like, hey, you know,

14:00.680 --> 14:02.960
this is not as efficient as it could be.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.360
But, you know, it's avoiding the premature optimization

14:06.360 --> 14:07.920
kind of thing, general intelligence.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.080
Yes, that's what I was looking for.

14:10.080 --> 14:10.920
That's three body problem.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.600
And yeah, that's the one I was looking for.

14:13.080 --> 14:17.560
So, you know, these things are all super fascinating.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.760
Chat, GPT is a part of it.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.680
It's definitely a thing that I think needs to exist.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.160
I just feel like so many people

14:26.160 --> 14:28.440
are like freaking out about it right now.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.280
And I have to ask myself,

14:31.280 --> 14:33.080
isn't there something better you could be doing

14:33.080 --> 14:34.280
with your time?

14:34.280 --> 14:37.720
But that's not my business, do what you want with your time.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.880
I mean, I waste my time plenty good.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.040
So, you know, if you want to play around, then fine.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.120
I don't, I don't.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.840
I have no intention of doing it.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.800
If I could train my own chatbot,

14:48.800 --> 14:50.600
which I am interested in doing,

14:50.600 --> 14:55.680
my goal with AI is to create my,

14:55.680 --> 14:57.200
you know how they say second brain, right?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.600
Second brain is another word for Zettlecasten.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.920
So I have, I've now, I'm up to like 1800 content nodes,

15:03.920 --> 15:06.920
knowledge nodes in my current Zettlecasten.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.200
I have three other knowledge bases

15:09.200 --> 15:12.800
that have over a thousand content nodes in each of them.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.240
And I am in the process of bringing all of those over.

15:15.240 --> 15:19.000
So it's like almost everything that I've ever written about.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.920
And once I get all of that content in one place,

15:21.920 --> 15:26.920
I really want to see how I could put

15:27.280 --> 15:31.320
some machine learning algorithmic stuff,

15:31.320 --> 15:32.360
not machine algorithms,

15:32.360 --> 15:35.200
but I want to see if I could build

15:35.200 --> 15:39.160
some machine learning into my own data stuff, right?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.840
And then, and then of course the extension of this is that,

15:41.840 --> 15:44.400
you know, the exchange grid, the knowledge exchange grid,

15:44.400 --> 15:47.480
once I can get, so let's say, let's say that I have,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.640
I know, text pregeneration, stuff like that, right?

15:49.640 --> 15:51.760
So I'm already doing templates and stuff,

15:51.760 --> 15:52.800
but I mean, it's very possible

15:52.800 --> 15:53.880
that I could do the template generation

15:53.880 --> 15:55.080
automatically through AI.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.800
But something else that's interesting that interests me is that,

15:59.800 --> 16:01.800
is that's just my corpus, right?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.840
I just have my data, my Zettlecasten,

16:03.840 --> 16:06.680
but the goal, and then we're probably like five years out

16:06.680 --> 16:09.480
on this, is to eventually be able to follow multiple other

16:09.480 --> 16:12.440
people and have a cash copy of their Zettlecasten

16:12.440 --> 16:13.520
with me as well.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.360
And, you know, you take that to the nth degree,

16:16.360 --> 16:18.160
if I've got a thousand people,

16:18.160 --> 16:20.520
and there are people that I personally have curated,

16:20.520 --> 16:22.520
my ring of trust about knowledge and that stuff,

16:22.520 --> 16:25.640
now I've created a corpus of data

16:25.640 --> 16:29.760
that's extremely compelling when it comes to not just

16:29.760 --> 16:32.640
searching, but making suggestions.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.440
And then, then we could put,

16:37.440 --> 16:39.000
is that what they call it, chat by utility?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.600
Yeah, and then I would put on top of that,

16:41.600 --> 16:43.880
I would start to layer in the AI,

16:43.880 --> 16:46.480
and then I could have the AI suggest things to me,

16:46.480 --> 16:48.960
or when I start writing about something,

16:48.960 --> 16:52.120
I would love to have another T-Mex window open that's like,

16:52.120 --> 16:53.880
dude, you've already talked about this over here,

16:53.880 --> 16:55.480
and here, and here, and here, here's the other thing,

16:55.480 --> 16:57.040
and have it dynamically see,

16:57.040 --> 16:59.640
not just from the keywords that I'm using,

16:59.640 --> 17:01.260
which is, you know, a start,

17:01.260 --> 17:03.020
but I wanted to see, well, you know,

17:03.020 --> 17:06.300
you've written similarly to this,

17:06.300 --> 17:08.540
or somebody has written similarly to this,

17:08.540 --> 17:10.780
you know, and you see this kind of thing already

17:10.780 --> 17:13.980
in like, trouble ticket issues,

17:13.980 --> 17:18.860
and stuff like that, that we submit to GitHub,

17:18.860 --> 17:19.700
or anything like that, you know,

17:19.700 --> 17:20.540
you start typing things like,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.460
are you sure it's not this problem right here, right?

17:22.460 --> 17:26.580
So there's already, you know, code to do this,

17:26.580 --> 17:28.620
and that's kind of the, you know,

17:28.620 --> 17:30.260
phase two of the whole keg thing,

17:30.260 --> 17:33.100
you know, phase one is to get the knowledge,

17:33.100 --> 17:35.100
you know, really stable and collectible,

17:35.100 --> 17:37.020
and phase two is kind of exchange it,

17:37.020 --> 17:39.220
I guess it's apparently phase three,

17:39.220 --> 17:41.220
phase three would be processing the data,

17:41.220 --> 17:44.020
that would be processing all the knowledge,

17:44.020 --> 17:45.620
it's not going to fall about it.

17:47.140 --> 17:50.420
They did it for the reason of spam, yeah, I mean, yeah,

17:50.420 --> 17:52.700
I just would never want to put it,

17:52.700 --> 17:54.700
I mean, it's bad enough having a chat bot, you know,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.980
do one thing, the hardest part about all of this

17:56.980 --> 17:59.780
is going to be being able to determine who's real,

17:59.780 --> 18:03.180
and that's already becoming a thing, right?

18:03.180 --> 18:06.260
I mean, I imagine there's a lot of like, you know,

18:06.260 --> 18:08.620
porn and cheating sites that are going to love these,

18:08.620 --> 18:12.140
these AIs, because they're just going to be

18:12.140 --> 18:14.900
the best, you know, pretend girls ever,

18:14.900 --> 18:19.100
yeah, NPCs will be awesome, yeah,

18:19.100 --> 18:21.660
has apps now that check for secrets,

18:21.660 --> 18:24.260
check for dependency security flaws, yeah, yeah.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.660
Yeah, and there's like, there's chat,

18:26.660 --> 18:31.060
yeah, I mean, all of those sorts of things are stuff

18:31.060 --> 18:32.180
that I definitely want to add in.

18:32.180 --> 18:34.140
So I'm not, it's not that I'm against chat bots,

18:34.140 --> 18:35.740
I'm definitely adding a chat bot,

18:35.740 --> 18:38.260
I've already started adding a Twitch chat bot,

18:38.260 --> 18:42.620
which what I want it to do is like, you know,

18:42.620 --> 18:44.500
I have all these commands, right?

18:44.500 --> 18:46.260
But I hate maintaining the commands,

18:46.260 --> 18:49.140
so what I would rather have my chat bot do,

18:49.140 --> 18:51.540
my Twitch chat bot, what I would rather have it do

18:51.540 --> 18:55.060
is I would rather have it become intimately familiar

18:55.060 --> 18:57.380
with my Zettelkasten, right?

18:57.380 --> 19:01.860
So if somebody starts chatting about something,

19:01.860 --> 19:03.940
and Masi's already made some really amazing stuff

19:03.940 --> 19:06.380
on this level, if somebody starts chatting about something,

19:06.380 --> 19:10.260
I want my chat bot to score potentially a response

19:10.260 --> 19:12.140
and say, okay, somebody's talking like this,

19:12.140 --> 19:14.540
somebody used a question mark, somebody's doing whatever.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.660
And he'll say, if you're asking about this,

19:17.660 --> 19:19.580
this is what I was trying to do, right?

19:19.580 --> 19:21.900
So I would really love to be able to create

19:21.900 --> 19:25.660
kind of a proactive customer service-like bot in my Twitch

19:25.660 --> 19:27.780
that answers all of the mundane questions for me

19:27.780 --> 19:30.260
without people having to go to the commands, right?

19:30.260 --> 19:31.460
I mean, they go to the commands

19:31.460 --> 19:32.660
and then they have to filter through the commands

19:32.660 --> 19:33.780
and they have to find the right one,

19:33.780 --> 19:36.300
and sometimes they do and there's kind of a path through there,

19:36.300 --> 19:37.700
but I have to maintain all of that.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.380
And maintaining the commands, I actually was looking at it,

19:40.380 --> 19:42.620
I've got like 200, 300 commands.

19:42.620 --> 19:45.380
Yeah, if I train it on my Zett as my corp,

19:45.380 --> 19:48.540
yeah, then I would be, so then somebody asks a question

19:48.540 --> 19:51.820
and all I have to do is write.

19:52.100 --> 19:55.260
I don't have to go in and create all the interlinking

19:55.260 --> 19:57.980
and stuff like that inside of a specific,

19:57.980 --> 19:59.060
commands database.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.020
I just maintain my Zodacast and answer questions

20:01.020 --> 20:01.980
just like I'm doing right now,

20:01.980 --> 20:04.900
and then I include links to YouTube and stuff like that.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.780
And the links are identifiable

20:06.780 --> 20:08.540
because they've got the YouTube emoji on them.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.100
So my chat bot could be intelligent and say,

20:11.100 --> 20:13.540
hey, well, there's actually these YouTube videos on this too.

20:13.540 --> 20:18.020
And it could proactively engage with anybody in my chat

20:18.020 --> 20:19.940
while I'm writing and doing the work.

20:19.940 --> 20:22.980
And then I, I mean, it might not be as personal,

20:22.980 --> 20:25.460
but it could be very valuable.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.860
I think that personal broadcasting,

20:28.860 --> 20:30.900
as we do it now on this coworking kind of thing,

20:30.900 --> 20:32.100
is going to progress.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.980
I think, yeah, take care.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.340
It's, I think that this is one of those things

20:37.340 --> 20:40.420
that is going to progress

20:40.420 --> 20:41.700
and it's gonna become more valuable.

20:41.700 --> 20:44.660
Right now it's just kind of a fascination.

20:45.660 --> 20:50.660
But the day that I can point a chat GPT at my Zodacast

20:51.540 --> 20:54.340
and have it automatically train itself

20:54.340 --> 20:58.140
and get 90% accuracy on when to participate in my chat

20:58.140 --> 21:01.500
and about answering questions on my behalf as an AI,

21:01.500 --> 21:05.540
that's the time when I will become extremely interested in it.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.260
I will become extremely interested in it

21:07.260 --> 21:08.780
because then it's saving me time.

21:08.780 --> 21:11.020
That's what AI potentially could do.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.060
And, you know, somebody mentioned the teaching thing.

21:14.260 --> 21:16.260
I think there's another,

21:16.260 --> 21:21.260
I understand chat GPT is a subset of instructional GPT.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.660
Did you guys read about that?

21:22.660 --> 21:23.740
So there's another GPT.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.620
It's like, I think it's called instruction GPT.

21:26.620 --> 21:30.180
It's actually designed for training and teaching

21:30.180 --> 21:32.020
and stuff like that, more than just a random chat one.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.740
The random chat one is to get, you know,

21:33.740 --> 21:35.180
people's interest and stuff.

21:35.180 --> 21:37.740
So that actually does, does, is interesting to me.

21:37.740 --> 21:40.060
I think teaching is fine.

21:41.060 --> 21:46.060
I think that there, yeah,

21:47.260 --> 21:49.060
if there was some way to have it correct.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.620
So that's kind of, I mean, the thing of it,

21:51.620 --> 21:52.780
mostly that would be really cool

21:52.780 --> 21:54.860
is if you had a bot that was running, right?

21:54.860 --> 21:56.140
So if you had a bot that was running,

21:56.140 --> 21:58.740
it was trained off of your corpus and Zodacast then,

21:58.740 --> 22:00.500
it could chime in every once in a while

22:00.500 --> 22:02.220
and maybe it would get things wrong.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.460
It would say, well, that's not really the right answer there.

22:04.460 --> 22:05.740
Here's the right answer.

22:05.740 --> 22:08.900
And then it could take its correction,

22:08.900 --> 22:10.980
add it to its algorithm and say,

22:10.980 --> 22:13.060
so that whole thing that you have to do with AI,

22:13.060 --> 22:14.420
where you have to constantly correct it

22:14.420 --> 22:15.580
when it gets stuff wrong, right?

22:15.580 --> 22:17.100
But it learns.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.940
Every time it gets something wrong in a chat,

22:18.940 --> 22:20.820
we could laugh about it and I could correct it

22:20.820 --> 22:23.220
and then it would get that answer right next time.

22:23.220 --> 22:26.420
And then we could just keep going like that,

22:26.420 --> 22:27.260
you know what I mean?

22:27.260 --> 22:28.860
And it could try really hard

22:28.860 --> 22:31.180
and I could just kind of train it

22:31.180 --> 22:33.860
along with everybody else while I'm not here.

22:33.860 --> 22:38.860
So the idea of setting up like a SkiZix,

22:38.940 --> 22:40.540
so I used to name my bot,

22:40.540 --> 22:44.380
an interactive bot that dynamically learns

22:44.380 --> 22:46.980
by attempting to answer popular, frequent,

22:46.980 --> 22:48.220
unasked questions and getting them wrong

22:48.220 --> 22:49.340
and having it be corrected,

22:49.340 --> 22:52.660
that's like crazy, crazy compelling for me.

22:52.660 --> 22:54.340
And that's just from a customer service perspective,

22:54.340 --> 22:55.980
but from an educational perspective and all that.

22:55.980 --> 23:00.060
Now, if you're gonna start asking my bot about everything

23:00.060 --> 23:02.140
and putting that in your essay,

23:03.780 --> 23:05.300
I don't know how I feel about that.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.740
Maybe it's just making searching efficient.

23:07.740 --> 23:08.880
I mean, I say that all the time.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.200
I say if you wanna be in good in tech,

23:10.200 --> 23:11.480
you gotta be a really good researcher,

23:11.480 --> 23:12.400
be able to search fast.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.880
Well, if you have a bot that's doing all the searching

23:15.880 --> 23:17.880
for you all the time and you're just asking your bot

23:17.880 --> 23:20.720
about that's more likely to get the right answer,

23:20.720 --> 23:25.720
then, you know, as it takes four gigabytes of GP RAM

23:26.040 --> 23:28.100
to train these modern models, really.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.460
Yeah, well, there's a lot of them, yeah.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.640
Yeah, I don't know.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.440
It'd be interesting to see how much I could do.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.240
I mean, I do have my thing over here.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.240
So, I'm trying to figure out how much I could actually do

23:42.240 --> 23:45.360
that, it'd have to have a lot of data too, right?

23:45.360 --> 23:46.200
So,

23:49.520 --> 23:54.520
oh no, no, that would not be a thing to get, yes.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.280
So, that's my opinion on it.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.120
Yeah, I'm kind of underwhelmed with it,

24:01.120 --> 24:02.760
but I know that it's going in the right direction.

24:02.760 --> 24:03.840
I guess I'm kind of annoyed

24:03.840 --> 24:06.360
because everybody's asking me about it.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.800
And I'm like, well, what are you using it for?

24:08.800 --> 24:11.520
And every time I ask what they're using it for,

24:12.640 --> 24:14.760
it's, well, it's making me do my homework faster.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.840
And I'm like, oh my God, it's like,

24:17.840 --> 24:19.160
but I don't know if that's bad.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.520
I think it's bad.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.760
I think it's bad because people are not doing

24:21.760 --> 24:23.240
their own research.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.440
It's one of two things.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.960
They're either not doing their own research

24:25.960 --> 24:28.960
or it's facilitating their research, right?

24:28.960 --> 24:33.320
If it's the second, then I'm all for that.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.920
I mean, the terminal makes you faster

24:34.920 --> 24:37.160
during your own research, so why not an AI?

24:38.600 --> 24:43.440
So, you know, if you shut learning, yeah.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.880
So, I think that's it.

24:47.880 --> 24:52.680
I mean, I don't have any inclination to play with it.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.920
I got too many other things to make right now,

24:53.920 --> 24:58.920
but as I said, if it were gonna make my Twitch bot

24:59.040 --> 25:01.400
more intelligent so that it could help people

25:01.400 --> 25:04.600
learn more quickly and save me some time,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.480
then that's a good thing.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.320
That's a good thing.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.720
So, I'll try to keep my thoughts open on that,

25:09.720 --> 25:12.680
but Project Matters and Ceaseless are on board.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.720
It will replace jobs.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.320
Then I'm fine with it, use it as an education.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.880
They can't have it, just won't want it.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.880
Why would they have it replace jobs?

25:21.880 --> 25:23.200
I don't understand that statement at all.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.400
I've heard that before.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.620
This chat bot is no word near replacing anyone.

25:29.880 --> 25:34.380
I mean, even the people who operated the front desk

25:34.860 --> 25:37.380
like the place that took my piss for my drug test.

25:39.740 --> 25:44.740
Even they are not replaceable yet by this.

25:45.140 --> 25:49.340
I mean, I just, I don't see it being that reliable.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.200
And they were pretty damn bad.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.140
I don't even want to talk about it.

25:56.140 --> 25:58.420
Oh, I'm sorry, as you're here at 3.58,

25:58.420 --> 26:00.380
at 12.58 and not one o'clock,

26:00.380 --> 26:02.660
you need to wait until one o'clock.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.500
Really?

26:03.620 --> 26:04.460
I just don't even want to.

26:04.460 --> 26:06.060
It's a different thing completely.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.220
I just had to go through.

26:08.220 --> 26:11.140
I had to wait in line for like two hours

26:11.140 --> 26:12.140
to get a drug test.

26:12.140 --> 26:12.980
My phone died.

26:12.980 --> 26:14.100
I had to come back the next day

26:14.100 --> 26:15.860
and wait again for two hours.

26:18.140 --> 26:21.020
See, any of those things that could be improved by AI,

26:21.020 --> 26:22.180
I'm down.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.020
I'm down.

26:24.300 --> 26:27.380
I'm down with those things being approved.

26:27.380 --> 26:28.820
Corporations are going to use it eventually

26:28.820 --> 26:30.540
and people should use it as well as benefit them.

26:30.540 --> 26:31.780
Yeah, for sure.

26:31.780 --> 26:32.780
Teachers are next.

26:33.780 --> 26:35.740
At least the current way of teaching.

26:35.740 --> 26:37.820
Well, I think the current way of teaching is totally broken.

26:37.820 --> 26:40.580
So I am all about having...

26:42.620 --> 26:47.620
I am all about the education getting disrupted by AI.

26:48.100 --> 26:51.060
And it's not completely untrue that the way

26:51.060 --> 26:53.580
that education is happening now could be taken over

26:53.580 --> 26:55.700
by an AI, absolutely.

26:55.700 --> 26:56.740
Absolutely.

26:56.740 --> 27:01.300
It's like, okay, I'm gonna tell you about a topic in general

27:01.300 --> 27:02.980
and I'm gonna sit here and blah, blah, blah.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.900
And you're gonna take notes and there's no ability

27:04.900 --> 27:07.380
for us to interact except for off hours.

27:07.380 --> 27:11.300
And then you get like an hour possibly with a TA.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.620
You know, the entire model for modern education

27:14.620 --> 27:16.260
is totally broken.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.780
It's totally broken.

27:17.780 --> 27:21.700
And it could easily be replaced by AI.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.380
I completely agree with that.

27:24.540 --> 27:27.340
But if you take the true learning model,

27:27.340 --> 27:29.420
the Art of Ex thing that we talked about,

27:29.420 --> 27:32.420
then where you're failing faster and you're being organic

27:32.460 --> 27:36.540
and you have a one-on-one mentor who knows you personally,

27:36.540 --> 27:37.780
I think we're a ways from that.

27:37.780 --> 27:40.260
I do think that AI could get there.

27:40.260 --> 27:44.860
I think that AI could have a strong chance

27:44.860 --> 27:48.140
at learning about you and learning about your interests

27:48.140 --> 27:50.220
and learning about what you struggle with and learning.

27:50.220 --> 27:54.140
I think those things for education could be really cool.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.380
I mean, think about that.

27:55.380 --> 27:59.540
That you could have an AI that becomes trained

27:59.540 --> 28:01.980
on your regular failures.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.780
So maybe you're learning a foreign language

28:04.780 --> 28:08.060
and you get imperative declension wrong in Russian

28:08.060 --> 28:09.220
all the time.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.860
It's like the thing, it's constantly doing the assessments

28:11.860 --> 28:13.900
and everything that a teacher would be doing

28:13.900 --> 28:16.300
and then never doing anything, just giving you an F, right?

28:16.300 --> 28:18.060
It would be adapting and saying,

28:18.060 --> 28:20.340
hey, okay, I know you have trouble with this one thing,

28:20.340 --> 28:21.940
so I'm gonna give you more of these things.

28:21.940 --> 28:26.140
So the potential to have AI adapt to our weaknesses

28:26.140 --> 28:27.180
as we're learning,

28:27.180 --> 28:28.500
maybe we don't remember things very well.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.060
That would be me, right?

28:30.060 --> 28:32.900
So it would be more about repetition.

28:32.900 --> 28:35.100
I think that there's a tremendous potential there

28:35.100 --> 28:36.500
for that, I really do.

28:37.580 --> 28:39.180
Intermediate with video graphics, not just text.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.140
So whole learning path,

28:40.140 --> 28:41.580
focus on the way of learning with custom graphics

28:41.580 --> 28:42.740
to explain, yeah.

28:42.740 --> 28:43.700
Well, and that's another thing too.

28:43.700 --> 28:45.060
I mean, there's a book out there

28:45.060 --> 28:46.220
called Multiple Intelligences

28:46.220 --> 28:49.500
and it talks about all the different ways that we learn.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.980
Thomas, what's his name, Sir Ken.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.140
Sir Ken talks about this.

28:53.140 --> 28:56.260
The woman who created the Juilliard Academy failed.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.380
She failed out of all her classes

28:58.380 --> 28:59.620
and they took her to a specialist

28:59.660 --> 29:01.020
and she was moving around

29:01.020 --> 29:04.340
and the specialist said to the parents, look at her.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.260
And she goes, what?

29:05.260 --> 29:07.220
And he goes, she has to be moving.

29:07.220 --> 29:08.580
They got her in a special school

29:08.580 --> 29:10.740
that was dynamic for dynamic learners

29:10.740 --> 29:13.180
who were walking around, had to be moving to learning.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.300
And she excelled.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.620
She excelled so much, she made the most,

29:16.620 --> 29:17.980
she made Juilliard Academy out of it.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.700
If they had written her off because of her learning style,

29:20.700 --> 29:25.100
and that is one way that AI can adapt.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.380
I mean, everybody knows a teacher,

29:26.380 --> 29:27.460
the best teachers in the world

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
are the ones who are able to adapt to the individual peak.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.220
Students, right?

29:31.220 --> 29:33.740
And there's tons and tons of horrible teachers

29:33.740 --> 29:35.140
who don't adapt at all.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.220
They stay in their methods, they do their thing.

29:38.220 --> 29:41.100
It's like you adapt to them or you die and get an F

29:41.100 --> 29:42.300
and you have to take it over again

29:42.300 --> 29:43.260
and spend all the money.

29:43.260 --> 29:44.860
There's plenty of that.

29:44.860 --> 29:48.660
But if you, so the good teachers who adapt

29:48.660 --> 29:52.460
and make things engaging and change their methods

29:52.460 --> 29:56.460
or allow God forbid one student to do one project

29:56.460 --> 29:57.780
that's different than another student

29:57.780 --> 29:59.980
because of the way that they learn.

29:59.980 --> 30:04.980
I mean, how do you set up a rubric for that?

30:07.940 --> 30:09.140
You can't.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.420
But if you have an AI, maybe an AI kind of thing

30:12.420 --> 30:16.060
is gonna get us into this closer to one-on-one education,

30:16.060 --> 30:18.220
which is the holy grail.

30:18.220 --> 30:20.580
One-on-one education has been the way humans

30:20.580 --> 30:23.960
have been learning best since the dawn of time.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.260
There's overwhelming evidence of this,

30:26.260 --> 30:28.820
but nobody accepts that evidence

30:28.820 --> 30:32.600
because it's too impractical to do.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.300
At least they say, I don't think it is.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.180
I think that if they were to actually economically,

30:36.180 --> 30:38.580
I think they can make it work, but they don't.

30:38.580 --> 30:39.700
And in order to make it work,

30:39.700 --> 30:43.020
you'd have to have mentors adapted to a different,

30:43.020 --> 30:45.300
I mean, when you had back in the old days,

30:45.300 --> 30:47.580
it was like one-on-one and if that pairing didn't work,

30:47.580 --> 30:49.540
you would find a different guru or a different master

30:49.540 --> 30:50.380
and you would go to that person.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.020
You would go to one person for their mastery in this thing

30:53.020 --> 30:54.300
and another person in a mastery in this thing.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.180
That's true education.

30:56.180 --> 30:59.780
And that's not happening in the traditional system,

30:59.780 --> 31:01.380
but AI could potentially do it.

31:01.380 --> 31:03.900
AI could potentially do it, it could.

31:03.900 --> 31:06.300
Yeah, reviews on game writers versus 10 years ago.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.900
Oh yeah, yes.

31:08.900 --> 31:13.780
Yeah, based on consensus.

31:13.780 --> 31:15.220
Well, I think one of the things

31:15.220 --> 31:18.500
that individual instruction like that is going to get both.

31:18.500 --> 31:23.500
This is something interesting about what I want to say here.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.700
Homeschooling.

31:27.700 --> 31:29.700
So that's, okay, so I live in the South, right?

31:29.700 --> 31:31.340
I live in North Carolina.

31:31.340 --> 31:35.860
And ironically, there's extreme agreement

31:37.500 --> 31:41.940
between very, very right-wing conservatives

31:41.940 --> 31:45.340
and very, very leftist progressives

31:47.020 --> 31:49.020
on this topic of homeschooling.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.220
Now, I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,

31:52.260 --> 31:55.700
but they agree that the current system

31:55.700 --> 31:57.620
does not meet their needs.

31:57.620 --> 31:58.860
Now, the one people agree

31:58.860 --> 32:00.540
because they don't think mathematics

32:00.540 --> 32:01.740
and science are a priority

32:01.740 --> 32:04.420
and that faith in Jesus is all that matters.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.060
I was told that to my face

32:06.060 --> 32:09.300
when my son was denied access to such a school

32:09.300 --> 32:11.660
because he didn't have enough belief in Jesus

32:11.660 --> 32:14.220
according to their method, because we were Mormon.

32:14.220 --> 32:15.460
That's a true story.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.260
But they had, we thought more direct instruction

32:20.260 --> 32:22.540
would be better, but it turns out, no.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.820
They literally told us math and sciences

32:24.820 --> 32:26.820
are secondary to faith in Jesus.

32:26.820 --> 32:30.820
And we're like, okay, we'll be moving on now.

32:30.820 --> 32:32.620
And then you have the other people

32:32.620 --> 32:35.420
who are all about the mass and the sciences

32:35.420 --> 32:38.020
and playing in mud and stuff like that

32:38.020 --> 32:39.620
in kind of the hippie education.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.100
And believe it or not,

32:43.980 --> 32:47.260
so believe it or not, those two camps

32:47.260 --> 32:48.660
both want the same thing.

32:48.660 --> 32:52.180
They want the government to get out of the way

32:52.180 --> 32:54.180
when it comes to education

32:54.180 --> 32:56.060
because they believe that education

32:56.060 --> 32:57.180
can't be done properly

32:57.180 --> 33:02.180
through any kind of singularly interested association

33:02.500 --> 33:05.460
and all the problems that are coming up in education

33:05.460 --> 33:07.420
are all related to this thing.

33:07.420 --> 33:10.700
I just don't know if it's a good thing or bad thing

33:10.700 --> 33:14.020
to let people even get more in their sandbox.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.660
I mean, I think, I don't know.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.860
I don't know, it's a really divisive topic.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.100
Interested both South Carolina power stations

33:23.100 --> 33:23.940
have been talking this week.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.100
Oh, I know.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.740
I know, I was here.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.360
Dude, I saw it.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.380
I don't want to talk about it right now.

33:30.380 --> 33:32.260
We can talk about that at a different time.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.980
No, they confirmed it was an act of terrorism in our state.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.200
So we're Ireland now.

33:38.820 --> 33:40.640
Yeah, it's in my state.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.520
I'm seeing it on the news all the time.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.960
It's not even far away.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.200
Yeah, so we are Ireland.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.720
America is officially Ireland.

33:50.680 --> 33:55.680
We're getting attacked by domestic terrorists.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.240
They took out our power grid for two days.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.360
Yep, let's talk about that another time.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.360
I don't know if AI is gonna help with that.
