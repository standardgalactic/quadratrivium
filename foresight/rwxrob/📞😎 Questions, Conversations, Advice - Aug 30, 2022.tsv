8000	12000	which happens to be international. And so the first question today is, what is the best way to learn foreign languages?
12000	17000	And we've been actually having fun here because somebody asked me to, oh god, what are you sending us?
17000	24000	I'm a little bit afraid. I'm a little afraid of what this is. Somebody's sending us random things.

35000	38000	You don't speak French like an American. You speak French like a French person.
38000	40000	And I was like, well, thank you. That's very nice.
40000	43000	And then I proceeded to like try every American accent I could.

47000	50000	And then said he says, now do it like a valley girl.
50000	53000	I want to do it very well.
