00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
All right, so the question is, should you use books or should you just use a documentation

00:07.800 --> 00:10.800
that comes with the program?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.280
Somebody asked a question, so I'm answering it.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.280
It's a very easy one.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.480
Yes, you should do both.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.480
You should do both.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.920
You should use books and you should use the man page.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.040
It's funny because there's actually a very negative comment on one of my YouTube videos

00:24.040 --> 00:28.240
I read recently that said, oh, this is another one of those boomers is going to tell us to

00:28.240 --> 00:33.880
just read the man pages that come with the system.

00:33.880 --> 00:40.200
I'm going to refrain from being negative about this completely unemployed mediocre, doesn't

00:40.200 --> 00:41.200
finish watching the video.

00:41.200 --> 00:46.480
A human being who made a comment on my YouTube video, hey, there's a lot of them and I will

00:46.480 --> 00:52.040
instead say that if you are going to learn something, you need to figure out what it

00:52.040 --> 00:55.200
is you're going to learn and then you need to target the learning resources that are

00:55.200 --> 00:58.080
best to learn that thing.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.640
I don't need to say anything else.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.640
Is it a book?

01:02.640 --> 01:06.800
Let me tell you the advantages of books over the stuff that comes on the system.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.760
The advantage of a book is that the book has largely usually been edited.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.680
That means that somebody has, there's usually a single author, one or two people have authored

01:17.680 --> 01:19.360
it, so you get a common voice.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.360
It's usually been edited.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.360
Usually, it's been edited.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.360
I actually did another video all about that.

01:24.120 --> 01:27.840
Why is it to stay away from pack publishing versus a Riley, blah, blah, blah.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.600
You want to get a good book.

01:29.600 --> 01:34.720
As usual, find, if you've got a mentor already, if you have somebody who's in the industry

01:34.720 --> 01:37.920
and you've already done the work, which is way, way, way, way before you should be asking

01:37.920 --> 01:40.880
whether you should read a book or not, you shouldn't be asking me that.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.600
You should be asking the person that you've found to be your mentor and that is something

01:44.600 --> 01:47.360
you should have already done.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.480
You might be using me as a fill-in for your mentor for right now, but I'm telling you,

01:51.480 --> 01:56.880
find a mentor who's doing your job, the job you want, and then ask them, what do you think

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
is good?

01:57.880 --> 01:58.880
Is this book good?

01:58.880 --> 01:59.920
Is this thing here good?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.200
Is this video good?

02:01.200 --> 02:02.280
Is this series good?

02:02.280 --> 02:04.640
Because they're going to be the ones that are going to tell you what learning resources

02:04.640 --> 02:05.640
use.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.080
That is really at the core of the question.

02:07.080 --> 02:12.160
The question isn't about whether you should read from the man pages and do web searches

02:12.160 --> 02:14.160
on a given thing or should you read the book.

02:14.160 --> 02:21.600
The question is, where is the best place to learn the skills, knowledge, and abilities

02:21.600 --> 02:28.600
for the specific targeted career that I want, Mr. or Mrs. Mentor?

02:28.600 --> 02:32.960
You're going to ask the person, not me, and it's going to depend completely depending

02:32.960 --> 02:33.960
on the thing.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.960
I'm not trying to dodge the question.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.560
I'm trying to tell you that it makes sense.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.760
I have one story about this.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.760
I've told a story before.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.680
I'm going to tell you a quick version of it.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.920
I went to training for a week.

02:44.920 --> 02:49.560
I've done this video, I've done this story like three times.

02:49.560 --> 02:54.600
I went to training for a week, so they paid $2,500, $3,000, something like that.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.600
Horrible training.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.960
Everybody got a gold star at the end.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.280
I went home and said, never send me to that again, manager.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.280
Barb loved her.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.280
She was great.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.280
Give me the money instead.

03:02.280 --> 03:06.680
Went to Powell's books in Portland, bought all the books I ever could want to study and

03:06.680 --> 03:07.680
learn from those books.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.360
Having learned from my mentors, those were the books to get.

03:12.360 --> 03:17.880
We're talking about old school chin beard, brilliant geniuses who dropped out of Reed

03:17.880 --> 03:26.160
College, who had printed versions of the Unixman pages on their shelves.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.480
Stupid YouTube commenters who don't understand how to do capitalization might make comments

03:29.480 --> 03:30.600
about those people.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.440
I would rather listen to them.

03:32.440 --> 03:36.920
They said, no, if you wanted a definitive resource on Bash, there is nothing better than

03:36.920 --> 03:39.440
the Bashman page, literally.

03:39.440 --> 03:45.400
There is not a single book on planet Earth that covers completion using the dash capital

03:45.400 --> 03:46.480
C on Bash.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.320
It just does not exist.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.680
I only discovered it by reading the Bashman page.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.720
It does not exist anywhere else.

03:53.720 --> 03:57.360
If you want a comprehensive knowledge of a particular thing, in the case of Bash, you

03:57.360 --> 04:01.000
would go with the Bashman page on the system above any other printed material.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.360
I've read five or six other books related to it.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.360
Yes, it's true that sometimes the resource is going to be better.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.240
If you want to understand TCPIP, you can read the specification for TCPIP and the RFCs.

04:13.240 --> 04:17.320
You learn to read specifications, separate video about learning to read specifications.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.120
At some point, I don't know if that's necessarily going to fall under the boost.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.120
We'll find out.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.320
But reading the specifications is a really good way to do that.

04:24.320 --> 04:29.280
Or you can buy TCPIP illustrated from Addison Wesley, which is the standard college textbook

04:29.280 --> 04:31.160
to learn TCPIP.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.720
But it's extremely deep.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.000
It's extremely low level.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.880
It tells you everything you want to know about how a packet is formed.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.160
Should you buy the book or should you go read the spec?

04:40.160 --> 04:41.360
Probably both in that case.

04:41.360 --> 04:46.040
The point is, it depends, and hopefully you have enough stories to do that.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.720
Hopefully you have enough stories to know about how to go on that.
