0	12480	time. All right. Chapter one, Ada countless of loveless. Political science. In May 1833,
12480	18640	when she was 17, Ada Byron was among the young women presented at the British Royal Court.
19520	25040	Family members had worried about how she would acquit herself, given her high, strong and
25040	31760	independent nature, but she ended up behaving. Her mother reported, quote, tolerably well.
33200	38400	Among those Ada met that evening were the Duke of Wellington, whose straightforward manner
38400	46080	she admired, and the 79-year-old French ambassador, Tallie Rand, who struck her as, quote, an old monkey.
46160	55840	The only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron, Ada had inherited her father's romantic spirit,
55840	59840	a trait that her mother tried to temper by having her tutored in mathematics.
60560	65760	The combination produced an Ada a love for what she took to calling, quote, political science,
65760	71760	poetical science, which linked her rebellious imagination to her enchantment with numbers.
72400	77920	For many, including her father, the rarefied sensibilities of the romantic era clashed
77920	83040	with the techno excitement of the industrial revolution. But Ada was comfortable at the
83040	91680	intersection of both areas. So it was not surprising that her debut at court, despite the glamour of
91680	99200	the occasion, made less impression on her than her attendance a few weeks later at another
99200	107760	majestic event of the London season. At which she met Charles Babbage, a 41-year-old widowed
107760	112880	science and math eminence who had established himself as a luminary on London's social circuit.
113760	119040	Quote, Ada was more pleased with the party she was at on Wednesday than with any of the
119040	125040	assemblages in the Grand Monde, her mother reported to a friend. She met there a few scientific people
125040	131840	among them Babbage, who with whom she was very delighted, end quote. Babbage is galvanizing
131840	138080	weekly salons, which included up to 300 guests, brought together lords in swallowtail coats,
138800	145600	and ladies in brocade gowns, and writers, industrialist poets, actors, statesmen, explorers,
145600	150320	botanists, and other scientists, the word that Babbage's friends had recently coined.
151280	156000	By bringing scientific scholars into the exalted realm, said one of the geologists,
156000	161040	Babbage, quote, successfully asserted the rank in society due to science.
162880	171200	They invented the word science, my friends. The evenings featured dancing, readings, games,
171200	176880	and lectures accompanied by the assortment of seafood, meat, foul, exotic drinks, and ice desserts.
177520	178000	Cheers.
183200	189680	The ladies staged tableaux vivants in which they dressed in costumes to recreate famous paintings.
191040	196320	Astronomers set up telescopes, researchers displayed their electric and magnetic contrivances,
196960	202000	and Babbage allowed guests to play with his mechanical dolls. The centerpiece of the evening,
202000	208240	and one of Babbage's many motives for hosting them, was his demonstration of a model portion
208240	215200	of his, quote, difference engine, a mammoth mechanical calculating contraption that he
215200	220320	was building in the fireproof structure adjacent to his home. Babbage would display the model with
220320	225040	great drama, cranking his arm as it calculated the sequence of numbers, and just as the audience
225040	230480	began to get bored, showed how the pattern could suddenly be changed based on the instructions
230480	235520	that he had coded into the machine. Those who were especially intrigued would be invited through
235520	240400	the yard to the former stables where the complete machine was being constructed.
242080	245680	Babbage's difference engine, which could solve polynomial equations,
246240	250400	impressed people in different ways. The Duke of Wellington commented that it could be useful
250400	258320	in analyzing the variables a general might face before going into battle. Ada's mother, Lord Byron,
258320	266960	marveled that it was a, quote, thinking machine. As for Ada, who would later famously note that
266960	272960	machines could never truly think, a friend who went with them to the demonstration reported,
272960	279520	quote, Ms Byron, young as she was, understood its workings, and she was the, quote, great beauty
279520	286960	of the invention. Ada's love of both poetry and math primed her to see the beauty in the
286960	292240	computing machine. She was an exemplar of the era of romantic science,
292240	295760	which was characterized by a lyrical enthusiasm for invention and discovery.
296560	303040	It was a period that brought, quote, imaginative intensity and excitement to the scientific work,
304080	309520	Richard Holmes wrote in his Age of the Wonder, quote, it was driven by the common ideal of
309520	315440	intense, even reckless personal commitment to discovery, unquote. In short, it was a time
315440	320640	not unlike our own. The advances of the Industrial Revolution, including the steam engine, mechanical
320640	326880	loom, and telegraph, transformed the 19th century in much the same way that the advances of the
326880	333200	digital revolution, the computer, microchip, and the internet have transformed us in our own.
334160	338400	At the heart of both eras were innovators who combined imagination and passion with
338400	343920	wondrous technology, a mix that produced Ada's poetic gulf science, and what the 20th century
343920	353600	poet Richard Rottigan would call, quote, machines of lovely grace. Lord Byron.
355680	361440	Ada inherited her poetic insubordinate temper from her father, but he was not the source of her love
361440	367520	for machinery. He was, in fact, a Luddite. In the maiden speech in the House of Lords, given in
367520	374800	February 1812, when he was about 24, Byron defended the followers of Ned Ludd, who were rampaging
374800	381520	against mechanical weaving machines. With sarcastic scorn, Byron mocked the mill owners of Nottingham,
381520	385920	who were pushing a bill that would have made destroying automated looms a crime punishable
385920	391440	by death, quote, these machines were to them an advantage in so much as they superseded the
391440	396320	necessity of employing a number of workmen who were left in consequence to starve, unquote,
396320	401840	Byron declared. The rejected workmen and the blindness of their ignorance instead of rejoicing
401840	406480	at the improvements in the arts so beneficial to mankind conceived themselves to be sacrificed to
406480	413440	the improvements of the mechanism, end, quote. Two weeks later, Byron published the first two
413440	420640	cantos of his epic poem, Child Harold's Pilgrimage, a romanticized account of his wanderings through
420640	426160	Portugal, Malta and Greece, and, as he later remarked, quote, awoke one morning and found
426160	433600	myself famous, end, quote. Beautiful, seductive, troubled, brooding, and sexually adventurous,
434320	440000	Byron was living a life of a bioronic hero while creating the archetype in his poetry.
440880	445680	He became the toast of literary London and was fed at three parties each day,
445680	452880	most memorable, a lavish morning dance hosted by Lady Caroline Lamb. Lady Caroline, though married
452880	458480	to a political powerful aristocrat who was later prime prime minister, fell madly in love with Byron.
459120	464160	He thought she was, quote, too thin, yet she had an unconventional sexual ambiguity.
465280	471520	She liked to dress like a page boy. He found that enticing. They had a turbulent affair and
471520	476480	after it ended, she stalked him obsessively. She famously declared to him, quote, be mad,
476480	484080	bad, and dangerous to know, which he was. So was she. At Lady Caroline's party, Lord Byron had
484080	488880	also noticed a reserved young woman who was, as he recalled, quote, more simply dressed.
489760	496320	Annabella Milbunk, 19, was from the wealthy and multi-titled family. The night before the party,
496320	502000	she had read Child Harold and had mixed feelings, quote. He is rather too much of a mannerist,
502000	508400	she wrote. He excels most in the delineation of deep feelings. Upon seeing him across the room
508400	513920	at the party, her feelings were conflicted, dangerously so, quote. I did not seek an introduction
513920	518480	to him for all the women were absurdly courting him and trying to deserve a lash of his satire,
518480	525520	she wrote to her mother. I'm not the Cyrus of a place in his laze. I made no offering at the shrine
525520	531040	of Child Harold, though I shall not refuse acquaintance if it comes my way.
532640	538000	That acquaintance, as it turned out, did come her way. After he was introduced to her formally,
538000	543520	Byron decided that she might make a suitable wife. It was for him a rare display of reason over
543520	547920	romanticism. Rather than arousing his passions, she seemed to be the sort of woman who might
547920	553040	tame those passions and protect him from his successes, as well as help him pay off his burdensome
553040	561360	debts. He proposed to her half-heartedly by letter. She sensibly declined. He wanted off to
561360	568080	far less appropriate liaisons, including one with his half-sister, Augustus Lay. But after a year,
568080	577760	Annabella rekindled her courtship. Byron, falling more deeply in debt while gasping for air at the
577760	583520	curb of his enthusiasm, saw the rationale if not the romance in the possible relationship.
584720	588960	Nothing but marriage and a speedy one can save me, he admitted to Annabelle's aunt.
590000	595040	If your niece is obtainable, I should prefer her if not the very first woman who does not
595040	601040	look as if she would spit in my face. There were times when Lord Byron was not a romantic.
601840	607520	He and Annabella were married in January 1915. Byron initiated the marriage in his
607520	614000	Byronic fashion. Had Lady Byron on the sofa before dinner, he wrote in his wedding day journal.
615280	619600	Their relationship was still active when they visited his half-two sisters months later because
619600	625040	around then Annabella got pregnant. However, during the visit, she began to suspect that
625040	630640	her husband's friendships with Augusta had been beyond fraternal, especially after he lay on a sofa
630640	637440	and asked them both to take him, turns kissing him. The marriage started to unravel. Annabella
637440	642960	had been tutored in mathematics, which amused Lord Byron. And during that, he was such a fucking
642960	648960	asshole. Lord Byron was such an asshole, man. And during the court should be a joked about
648960	656400	about his own disdain for the exactitude of numbers. Quote, I know that two and two make four
656400	661280	and should be glad to prove it if I could, he wrote. Though I must say, if any sort of process
661280	666400	like a convert two and two into five, it would give me great pleasure. Early on, he affectionately
666400	674800	dubbed her the quote, Princess of Parallelograms. I want somebody to call me the Princess of Parallelograms.
674800	684160	That's a great name. But when the marriage began to sour, he refined the mathematical image.
684640	689840	We are two parallel lines, prolonged by infinite side by side, but never to meet, he said. Later,
689840	696320	in his first canto of his epic poem, Don One, he would mock her. Her favorite science was the
696320	702880	mathematical. She was a walking calculation. The marriage was not saved by the birth of their
702880	711040	daughter or on December 10th, 1815, which may or may not be my exact birthday.
711680	718880	Some years later, of course, she was named Augusta Ada Byron, her first name that of Byron's
718880	724000	two beloved half sister. When Lady Byron became convinced of her husband's profidity,
724640	728880	she thereafter called her daughter by her middle name. Five weeks later, she packed her belongings
728880	735920	into a carriage and fled into her parents' country home with the infant Ada. Ada never knew her
736400	742160	father again. Lord Byron left the country that April after Lady Byron and led her so
742160	750800	calculating that she earned his subrequette of mathematical media, threatened to expose
750800	755920	his alleged incestuous and homosexual affairs as a way to secure a separation agreement that
755920	763680	gave her custody of their child. The opening of the canto three of Child Harold, written a few
764640	773120	weeks later, invokes Anna as his muse. In thy face, like thy mother's my fair child, Ada,
773120	779360	sole daughter of my house, of my heart. When last I saw thy young blue eyes, they smiled,
780000	786960	and then we parted. Byron wrote these lines in a villa like by Lake Geneva when he was staying
786960	795840	with the poet Percy Beasle Shelley and Shelley's future wife, Mary. It rained relentlessly,
795840	801360	trapped inside for days. Byron, it's like a franchise. It's like an industrial age franchise,
802000	807360	like a movie franchise. He meets the author of Frankenstein. Byron suggested that they write
807360	811440	horror stories. He produced a fragment of the tale about a vampire, one of the first literary
811440	816800	efforts of the subject, but Mary's story was the one that became classic, Frankenstein or
817520	823600	the modern Prometheus. Playing on the ancient Greek myth of the hero who crafted a living man
823600	828160	out of clay and snatched fire from the gods for human use, Frankenstein was the story of a scientist
828160	833120	who galvanized the man made assemblage into a thinking human. It was a cautionary tale about
833120	839120	technology and science and also raised a question that would become associated with Ada. Can man
839120	846560	made machines ever truly think? Third canto of chilled herald ends with Byron's prediction
846560	850800	that Annabella would try to keep Ada from knowing about her father, and so it happened.
851600	855600	There was a portrait of Lord Byron in the house, but Lady Byron kept it securely veiled
856400	862720	and Ada never saw it until she was 20. Lord Byron, by contrast, kept a picture of Ada on his desk
862800	869680	wherever he was, and his letters often requested news or portraits of her. When she was seven,
869680	874640	he wrote to Augusta, quote, I wish you would obtain from Lady B some accounts of Ada's disposition.
874640	878800	Is the girl imaginative? Is she passionate? I hope that the gods have made her anything
878800	886480	save political. It is enough to have one such fool in the family. Lady Byron reported that Ada had
886480	891920	an imagination that was, quote, chiefly exercised in connection with her mechanical ingenuity.
893120	896640	Around the time Byron, who had been wandering through Italy,
897200	902160	writing and having an assortment of affairs, grew bored and decided to enlist in the Greek
902160	911680	struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire. He sailed to Missologna, wherever he took command
911680	915920	of the part of the rebel army and prepared to attack the Turkish forces. But before he could
915920	920720	engage in battle, he caught a violent cold that was made worse by the doctor's decision to treat
920720	927920	him by bloodletting. On April 19, 1824, he died. According to his valet among his final words were,
927920	934560	quote, Oh, my poor dear child, my dear Ada, my God, could I have seen her? Give her my blessing.
940000	940400	Ada.
947520	949040	I've been reading the chat, but whatever.
950720	956400	Lord Byron wanted to make sure that Ada did not turn out like her father.
956400	959280	And Byron's strategy was to have the girls rigorously study math,
960240	965840	as if it were an antidote to poetic imagination. When Ada at age five showed a preference for
965840	970640	geography, Lady Byron ordered that the subject be replaced by additional arithmetic lessons,
970640	976560	and her governess soon proudly reported, quote, she adds up sums of five and six rows of figures
976560	982400	with accuracy. Despite these efforts, Ada developed some of her father's propensities.
982400	986480	She had an affair with a young teenager with one of her tutors and with one of her tutors,
986480	990800	and when they were caught and the tutor banished, she tried to run away from the home to be with him.
991440	996240	In addition, she had mood swings that took her from feelings of grandiosity to despair,
996240	999600	and she suffered various maladies, both physical and psychological.
1000240	1005600	Ada accepted her mother's conviction that the immersion in math could help
1005600	1011360	pertain her Byronic tendencies. After her dangerous liaison with her tutor and inspired
1011360	1017200	by Babbage's Difference Engine, she decided on her own at 18 to begin a new series of lessons,
1017200	1022880	quote, I must cease to think of living for pleasure or self-critification, she wrote to her new tutor.
1023680	1028400	I find that nothing but very close and intense application of subjects of a scientific nature
1028400	1034400	now seems to keep my imagination running wild from running wild. It appears to me that the first
1035120	1040240	thing to go through the course of mathematics, the first thing is to go through a course of
1040240	1047120	mathematics. He agreed with the prescription. You are right in supposing that your chief resource
1047120	1051680	and safeguard at the present is the course of severe intellectual study. For this purpose,
1051680	1058240	there is no subject to be compared to mathematics. The tutor prescribed Euclidean geometry
1058240	1063040	followed by a dose of trigonometry and algebra. That should cure anyone, they both thought,
1063040	1072480	from having too much artistic and romantic passion. That's awesome.
1080000	1085120	Ada's interest in technology was stoked when her mother took her on a trip through the British
1085120	1090800	industrial midlands to see the new factories and machinery. Ada was particularly impressed with an
1090800	1096800	automated weaving loom and used punch cards to direct the creation of the desired fabrics the way
1096800	1101920	she wanted to. That was, by the way, well, we're going to get to it. She drew a sketch of how it
1101920	1106960	worked. Her father's famous speech in the House of Lords had defended the Luddites who would smash
1106960	1113520	such looms because of their fear of what technology might do to their humanity, but Ada waxed political
1113520	1117520	about them and saw the connection with what would someday be called computers.
1119600	1124000	This machine reminds me of Babbage and the gem of all mechanisms, she wrote.
1126480	1130480	Ada's interest in applied science was further simulated when she met with one of Bruton's
1130480	1136720	free you for you noted female mathematician scientists, Mary Somerville. Somerville had
1136720	1141760	just finished writing one of her great works on the connection of the physical sciences
1142400	1146240	in which she tied together developments of astronomy, optics, and electricity,
1146240	1151360	chemistry, physics, botany, and geology. In Blomantic of the Time, it proved in a unified
1151360	1156160	sense of the extraordinary endeavors of discovery that were underway. She proclaimed in her opening
1156160	1161920	sentence, quote, the progress of modern science, especially within the last five years, has been
1161920	1167600	remarkable for a tendency to simplify the laws of nature and to unite detached branches of general
1167680	1173920	principles. Somerville became a friend, teacher, inspiration, and mentor Ada. She met with Ada
1173920	1180240	regularly. She sent her math books, devised problems for her to solve, and patiently explained the
1180240	1188720	correct answers. Mentorship, my friends, mentorship. She was a good friend of Babbage's and during the
1188720	1199520	fall of 1834, she and Ada would often visit this his Saturday evening solans. Somerville's son,
1200640	1207840	Wuronzo Greg, aided Ada's efforts to settle down by suggesting to one of his former classmates at
1207840	1212480	Cambridge that she would make a suitable or at least interesting wife.
1212480	1221840	William King was socially prominent, financially secure, quietly intelligent,
1222400	1227200	and as taciturn as Ada was excitable. Like her, he was a student of the science,
1227200	1231840	but his focus was more practical and less poetic. His primary interests were crop rotation theories
1231840	1236000	and advances in livestock breeding techniques. He proposed marriage within a few weeks of
1236000	1241840	meeting Ada, and she accepted. Her mother, with motives that only a psychiatrist could
1241840	1246240	fast as she could fathom, decided it was imperative to tell William about Ada's attempted
1246240	1251200	elopement with her tutor. Despite the news, William was willing to proceed with the wedding,
1251200	1257600	which was held on July 1835. Gracious God, who has so mercifully given you an opportunity
1257600	1263920	for turning aside the dangerous past, has given you a friend and guardian. Lady Byron wrote her
1263920	1269680	daughter, adding that she should use this opportunity to quote, bid adieu to all of her
1269680	1278000	peculiarities, capriciousness, and self-seeking. The marriage was a match made in rational calculus.
1279440	1283200	For Ada, it offered her a chance to adopt much more steady and grounded life.
1283200	1287840	More importantly, it allowed her to escape dependence on her domineering mother,
1287840	1292960	for William had been having a fascinating, eccentric wife from a wealthy and famous family.
1294160	1299040	Lord Byron's first cousin, Viscut Melbourne, who had the misfortune of having been married
1299040	1304480	to Lady Caroline Lamb by then deceased, was the prime minister, and he arranged that Queen
1304480	1309040	Victoria's coronation list of honors, William, would become the Earl of Loveless.
1310640	1317600	His wife thus became Ada, Countess of Loveless. She is therefore properly referred to as
1317600	1322000	Ada or Lady Loveless, though she is now commonly known as Ada Loveless.
1322960	1327600	That Christmas in 1835, Ada received from her mother the most fam- family-side portrait of her
1327600	1332160	father, painted by Thomas Phillips. It showed Lord Byron in a romantic profile, gazing at the
1332160	1337040	horizon, dressed in a traditional Albanian costume, featuring a red velvet jacket,
1337760	1343760	ceremonial sword, and headrest. For years, it had hung over Ada's grandparents' metal,
1343760	1349360	but it had never been veiled and unseen by the green cloth from the day her parents had separated.
1349360	1356640	Now she was trusted not only to see it, but to possess it, along with its ink stand and pen.
1358320	1361520	Her mother did something that was even more surprising when the Loveless first child,
1361520	1366800	a son, was born. A few months later, despite her disdain for her late husband's memory,
1366800	1374080	she agreed that Ada should name the boy Byron, which she did. The following year, Ada had a
1374080	1380800	daughter whom she dutifully named Annabella after her mother. Ada then came down with yet another
1380800	1386000	mysterious malady, which kept her bedridden for months. She recovered well enough to have a third
1386000	1392000	child, a son named Ralph, but her health remained fragile. She had digestive and respiratory problems,
1392560	1400080	and these were compounded by being treated with londonum, morphine, and other forms of opium,
1400080	1405760	which led to mood swings and occasional delusions. Ada was further unsettled by the
1405760	1409920	eruption of a personal drama that was bizarre enough by the standards of the Byron family.
1410560	1415040	It involved Madora Le, the daughter of Byron's half-sister and occasional lover.
1415040	1418240	According to the widely accepted rumors, Madora was Byron's daughter.
1419200	1424080	She seemed determined to show that that darkness ran in the family. She had an affair with a
1424080	1429280	sister's husband and then ran off with him to France and had two little limited illegitimate
1429280	1433840	children. In a fit of self-righteousness, Lady Byron went to France rescue Madora,
1434480	1437840	then revealed to Ada that the story of her father's incest.
1440080	1446000	This, quote, most strange and dreadful story did not seem to surprise Ada. I'm not happy
1446000	1449840	in the least astonished, but I'm not in the least astonished, she wrote to her mother.
1450480	1453760	You merely confirm that I have known for years and felt scarcely doubt about.
1454400	1458560	Rather than being outraged, she seemed oddly energized by the news. She declared that she
1458560	1463760	could relate to her father's defiance authority. Referring to his, quote, misused genius,
1464320	1471040	she wrote to her mother, quote, if he had transmitted to me any portion of that genius,
1471040	1475200	I would use it to bring out great truths and principles. I think he has bequested me
1475200	1481760	this task, in fact. I have this feeling strongly, and there is a pleasure attending to it, end quote.
1483120	1486000	Once again, Ada took up the study of math in order to settle herself.
1487200	1491600	She tried to convince Babish to become her tutor. I have a peculiar way of learning,
1491600	1499040	and I think it is, it must be a peculiar man to teach me, she said, whether due to her opiates
1499680	1506240	or her breeding or both. She developed a somewhat outsized opinion of her own talents,
1506240	1511440	and began to describe herself as a genius. In her letter to Babish, she wrote, quote,
1511440	1518240	do not reckon me conceited, but I believe I have the power of going just as far as I like in such
1518240	1525120	pursuits. And where were there is no decided a taste, I should almost say a passion as I have
1525120	1529120	for them. I question if there is not always some portion of natural genius even.
1531760	1538400	Babish deflected Ada's request, which was probably wise. It preserved their friendship
1538400	1542640	for an even more important collaboration, and she was able to secure a first-rate math tutor instead,
1543280	1549120	Augustus de Morgan, a patient gentleman who was pioneer in the field of symbolic logic.
1549120	1554240	He had propounded a concept that Ada would one day employ with great significance,
1555360	1562080	which was an algebraic equation could apply to things other than numbers. The relations among
1562080	1567280	symbols, for example, A plus B equals B plus A, could be part of a logic that applied to things
1567280	1573680	that were not numerical. And that slammed a calculus, by the way, I've been reading about it.
1573680	1582560	Oh, great. Love it. Am I drinking? I'm drinking rum.
1594880	1599120	Ada was never the great mathematician in her canonizer's claim,
1599680	1604880	but she was an eager pupil able to grasp most of the basic concepts of calculus and with her
1604880	1608720	artistic sensibility, she liked to visualize the changing curves and trajectories of the
1608720	1613840	equations being described. De Morgan, her tutor, encouraged her to focus on the rules
1613840	1618720	for working through equations, but she was more eager to discuss the underlying concepts.
1618720	1623280	Likewise with geometry, she often asked for visual ways to picture problems,
1623280	1628480	such as how the intersections of circles in a sphere divided into various shapes.
1630080	1634560	Ada's ability to appreciate the beauty of mathematics is a gift that eludes many people,
1635200	1639520	including some who think of themselves as intellectual. She realized that math was a
1639520	1644400	love, this is a narrator, that she realized that math was a loving language. Well, that described
1644400	1650240	the harmoniousness of the universe and can be poetic at times. Despite her mother's effort,
1650240	1654160	she remained her father's daughter with a poetic sensibility that allowed her to view the equations
1654240	1659280	of the brushstroke that painted an aspect of nature's physical splendor, just as she could
1659280	1665280	visualize the, quote, wire-dark sea, or a woman who, quote, walks in beauty light at night.
1666080	1672400	But math's appeal went even deeper for her. It was spiritual. Math constitutes the language
1672400	1678480	through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of the natural world, she said.
1678480	1685360	And it allows us to portray, quote, the changes of mutual relationship that unfold in creation.
1686160	1693440	It is the instrument through which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his creator's works.
1696000	1700320	This ability to apply imagination to science characterized industrial revolution as well
1700320	1706320	as the computer revolution, for which Ada was to become a major patron saint. She was able,
1706320	1711600	as she told Babbage, to understand the connection between poetry and analysis in ways that transcended
1711600	1720960	her father's talents. I do not believe that my father was or ever could have been such a poet
1720960	1727920	as I shall be an analyst. For with me, the two go together indissolutably, she wrote.
1729120	1734480	Her re-engagement with math, she told her mother, spurred her creativity and led to,
1734480	1740080	and quote, immense development of imagination, so much so that I feel no doubt that I continue my
1740080	1747120	studies, I shall do in due time become a poet. The whole concept of imagination, especially as it
1747120	1754480	was a pleasure technology, intrigued her. What is imagination, she asked in 1841. It is the
1754480	1759840	combining faculty, it brings together things, facts, and ideas, conceptions in new, original,
1759840	1766400	endless, ever-varying combinations. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us
1766400	1773920	and the worlds of science. By then Ada believed she possessed special, even supernatural abilities,
1774480	1781200	what she called, quote, an intuitive perception of hidden things. Her exalted view of her talents
1781200	1786320	led her to pursue aspirations that were unusual for an aristocratic woman and a mother of the
1786320	1791360	early Victorian age. Quote, I believe myself to possess a most singular combination of qualities
1791360	1797360	exactly fitted to make my preeminently a discoverer of the hidden realities of nature, end quote.
1798240	1803360	She explained in a letter that her mother in 1841, quote, I can throw rays from every
1803360	1810560	core of the universe into one vast focus. It was while this fame of mine that she just,
1810560	1815600	it was in this frame of mind that she decided to engage again with Charles Babbage, whose salons
1815600	1824160	she had first attended eight years earlier. She thinks she's Sheldon. She really does.
1832240	1834080	This is the innovators from Walter Isaacson.
1836800	1842800	Charles Babbage and his engines. Probably, this probably be the last one.
1842800	1848640	From an early age, Charles Babbage had been interested in machinery that could perform human
1848640	1853280	tests. When he was a child, his mother took him to many of the exhibition halls and numerous
1853280	1859680	museums that were springing up in London in the early 1800s. At one in Hanover Square,
1860960	1867440	a proprietor aptly named Merlin, invited him up to the attic workshop where there was a
1867440	1877120	variety of mechanical dolls known as automata. One was a silver female dancer about a foot tall,
1877120	1883200	whose arms moved with grace and who held in her hand a bird that could wag its tail,
1883200	1888560	flip its wings and open its beak. The silver lady's ability to display feelings and personality
1888560	1894080	captured the boys' fancy. Her eyes were full of imagination, he recalled. Years later, he discovered
1894080	1899600	the silver lady at a bankruptcy auction and bought it. It served as an amusement at the evening of
1899600	1905440	salons which he celebrated with wonders of technology later. At Cambridge, Babbage became
1905440	1913040	friends with groups including John Herschel and George Peacock who were disappointed by the way
1913040	1918640	math was being taught there. They formed a club called the Analytical Society which campaigned
1918640	1923440	to get the university to abandon the calculus notation devised by the alumnus Newton which
1923440	1931200	relied on dots and replaced it with the one devised by Leibniz which used dx and dy to represent
1932160	1938240	infinitesimally increments in what was known as denotation. Babbage's title the manifesto
1938240	1944800	quote that principles appear deism in opposition to the dot edge of the university. He was picky
1944800	1951920	but he had a good sense of humor. One day Babbage was at the Analytical Society's room working on
1951920	1956320	a table of logarithms that was littered with discrepancies. Herschel asked if him what he was
1956320	1963200	thinking quote he said, I wish to god these calculations had been executed by steam, Babbage
1963200	1968080	answered. To this idea of mechanical method for tabulating logarithms Herschel replied,
1968800	1974960	it is quite possible. In 1821 Babbage turned his attention to building just such a machine.
1975920	1982000	Over the years many had fiddled with making calculations, contraptions. In the 1640s Blaise
1982000	1986400	Pascal a French mathematician and philosopher created the mechanism, the mechanical calculator
1986400	1992080	to reduce the drudgery of his father's work as a tax supervisor. It had spoke metal wheels with
1992080	1997120	a digits zero through nine on their circumference. To add or subtract numbers the operator used a
1997120	2003920	stylus to dial a number as if using a rotary phone. Then dialed in the next number and armature
2004000	2010160	then carried or borrowed a one when necessary. It became the first calculator to be patented
2010160	2016320	and sold commercially. 30 years later Godfrey Libnitz the German mathematician philosopher
2016320	2021680	tried to improve upon Pascal's contraption with a quote stepped reckoner that had the capacity
2021680	2028560	to multiply and divide. It had a hand crake cylinder and a set of teeth that meshed with counting
2028560	2033200	wheels. But Libnitz ran into a problem that would be a recurring theme for the digital age.
2033680	2040080	Unlike Pascal and a Duat engineer who could combine scientific theories with mechanical genius
2040080	2044080	Libnitz had engineering skills that did not surround himself with those who did.
2044720	2050720	So like many great theories who lacked practical collaborators he was unable to produce reliable
2050720	2055280	working versions of his device. Nevertheless his core concepts known as the Liebnitz wheel
2055920	2058800	would influence calculator design through the time of Babbage.
2058800	2065040	Babbage knew of the devices of Pascal and Libnitz and he was trying to do something better than
2065040	2069520	them that was more complex. He wanted to construct a mechanical method for tabulating logarithmic
2069520	2074560	signs and cosines and tangents. To do so he adapted an idea from the French mathematician Gaspar
2074560	2081520	de Pony who had come up in the 1790s. In order to create logarithmic and trigonometric tables
2081520	2086320	de Pony broke down the operations into very simple steps that involved the only addition
2086320	2091760	and mess of traction. Then he provided easy instructions so that the scores of human laborers
2091760	2096080	who knew the little math could perform these simple tasks and pass along their answers to
2096080	2101920	the next set of laborers. In other words he created an assembly line the great industrial age
2101920	2107120	innovation that was memorably analyzed by Adam Smith in his description of the division of labor
2107120	2113360	in the pin making factory. After a trip to Paris in which he heard of de Pony's method Babbage wrote
2113840	2118080	I conceived all of a sudden the idea of applying this same method
2118080	2124560	to the immense work with which I had been burdened and to manufacture logarithms as one manufactures
2124560	2130960	pins. Even complex mathematical tasks Babbage realized could be broken into steps that came
2130960	2144560	down into calculating quote finite differences.
2152800	2153200	All right.
2154160	2161840	Calculating finite differences through simple adding and subtracting. For example in order to make a table
2161840	2166480	of squares one to the second two to the second three to second four to the second and so on
2166480	2172320	you could list the initial numbers in such a sequence one four nine sixteen. This would be column
2172320	2177440	A. Beside it in column B you could figure out the differences between each and the numbers in this
2177440	2184320	case three five nine seven and nine. Column C would be a list of differences between the column
2184320	2191040	B numbers which is two two two and two. Once the process was a simplified it could be reversed
2191040	2199120	and the task parceled out to untutored laborers. One would be in charge of adding two to the last
2199120	2203520	number of the column B and then the hand that resulted to the other person would then add the
2203520	2209120	results to the number A thus generating the next number in the sequence of squares. Babbage
2209120	2214400	divides the way to mechanize the process and he named it the difference engine. It can tabulate
2214400	2219200	any polynomial function and provide a number a digital method of approximating the solution to
2219200	2225600	differential equations. How did it work? The difference engine used vertical shafts with disks
2225600	2230800	that could be turned to any numeral. They were attached to cogs that would be cranked in order
2230800	2236240	to add that numeral or to subtract from it a disk on an adjacent shaft. The contraption was even
2236240	2242560	store the interim result on another shaft. The main complexity was how to carry or borrow when
2242560	2247200	necessary and what to do with pencils when we calculate the same thing we do with pencils
2247200	2253040	when we do 36 plus 19 or 42 minus 17. Drawing on Pascal's devices Babbage came up with a few
2253600	2259440	ingenious contrivances and allowed the cogs and shafts to handle the calculation. The machine
2259440	2263600	wasn't concept of true marvel. Babbage even figured out a way to get it to create a table
2263600	2268160	of prime numbers up to 10 million. The British government was impressed and at least initially
2268160	2276000	in 1823 it gave him a seed money of 1,700 pounds and would eventually sink more than 17,000 pounds
2276560	2281600	twice the cost of a warship into the device during the decade Babbage spent trying to build it.
2282240	2288720	But the project ran into two problems. First, Babbage had his hired engineer did not quite
2288720	2294320	have the skills to get the device working. Second, he began dreaming up something even better.
2298080	2302320	Babbage's new idea which he conceived in 1834 was a general purpose computer that could carry out
2302320	2307040	the very a variety of different operations based on programmatic instructions given to it.
2307760	2312320	It could perform one task and it made a switch to the perform another. It could even tell itself
2312320	2318640	to switch tasks or alter its quote patterns of action as Babbage called it based on its own
2318640	2325360	interim calculations. Babbage names this proposed machine the quote analytical engine. He was 100
2325360	2331040	years ahead of his time. The analytical engine was the product of what Ada Lovelace in her essay of
2331040	2336960	imagination had called quote the combining faculty. Babbage had combined innovations that had cropped
2336960	2341840	up in other fields to trick many great inventors have done. He had originally used a metal drum
2341840	2346000	for what had that was studied with spikes to control the shafts and how they would turn.
2346000	2353120	Then he studied as Ada had the automated loom invented by 1801 by the Frenchman named Joseph
2353120	2359600	Marie Jacquard which transformed the silk weaving industry. Looms created a pattern by using hooks
2359600	2365760	to lift selected warp threads and then a rod pushes a wolf thread underneath. Jacquard invented
2365760	2370720	a method of using cards with hole punches in order to control this process. The holes determine
2370720	2376480	which hooks and rods would be activated for each pass of the weave thus automating the creation
2376480	2381200	of intricate patterns. Each time the shuttle that was thrown to create a new pass of the thread a
2381200	2387520	new punch card was coming to play. On June 30th 1836 Babbage made an entry into what he called
2387520	2391680	his quote scribbling books that would represent the milestone in his pre in the prehistory of
2391680	2398640	computers quote suggested Jacquard's loom as a substitute for the drums. Using punch cards rather
2398640	2403040	than still drums meant that an unlimited number of instructions could be input into the machine.
2403040	2407360	In addition the sequence of tasks could be unmodified thus making it easier to devise a
2407360	2413440	general purpose machine that was versatile and reprogrammable. Babbage brought a portrait of
2413440	2420400	Jacquard and began to display it at the salons. He showed the inventor sitting in an armchair
2420400	2425040	loom in the background holding a pair of calipers over irregularly punch cards. Babbage amused his
2425120	2430560	guest by asking him to guess what it was. Most thought it was a superb engraving. He would then
2430560	2439440	reveal that it was actually a finely woven silk tapestry with 24,000 rows of threads each controlled
2439440	2446240	by a different punch card. When Prince Albert the husband of Queen Victoria came to one of
2446240	2452720	Babbage's salons he asked Babbage why he found the tapestry so interesting. Babbage replied
2453520	2458640	it will greatly assist in explaining the nature of my calculating machine, the analytical engine.
2460160	2464320	Few people however saw the beauty of Babbage's proposed new machine as the British government
2464320	2468880	had no inclination to fund it. Try and see my Babbage head could generate little notice in the
2468880	2474640	either popular press or the scientific journals but he did find one believer, Ada Loveless,
2474640	2480000	fully appreciated the concept of the general purpose machine. More importantly she envisioned an
2480000	2487200	attribute that might make it truly amazing if it could potentially process not only numbers
2487200	2494080	but any symbolic notation including musical and artistic notes. She saw the poetry in such an
2494080	2499840	idea and she set out to encourage others to see it as well. She barraged Babbage with letters some
2499840	2506000	of which verged on cheeky even though he was 24 years her senior and once she described her solitary
2506000	2513040	game using 26 marbles where the goal is to execute jumps so that only one of the marbles remains.
2513920	2518640	She had mastered it but was trying to derive a quote mathematical formula on which the solution
2518640	2524480	depends and which she could put her symbolic language to. Then she asked quote I am too
2524480	2530960	imaginative for you I think not. Her goal was to work with Babbage as his publicist and partner
2530960	2536160	in trying to get support to build the analytical engine quote I am very anxious to talk to you
2536160	2543840	she wrote in a early 1841 quote I will give you a hint on what it strikes me that at some
2543840	2552400	future time my head may be made by you subservient to some of your proposals and plans if so if ever
2552400	2559600	I could be worthy of capable of being used by you my head will be yours. A year later a tailor
2559600	2569040	made opportunity presented itself to the young Eda.
