0	6000	Hello, everybody. Just a quick little let you know about it.
6000	15000	We've gone ahead, I've gone ahead and broken out a new phase of, or a stage, whatever you want to call it, of the skill stack beginner boost,
15000	21000	which I was playing around with before, but it's kind of materialized at this point.
21000	28000	So here it is. If you look in the overview, scroll down.
28000	38000	So we have added the start, which is more about getting a job and what is this strategy of getting a job and finding out what you have to learn and everything.
38000	40000	Very, very important stuff. Please don't skip that.
40000	47000	And then we broke out the basic stuff, and that is what I'm going to show you here in just a second.
47000	53000	So it's, you know, what are basic computer skills? What does it even mean?
53000	65000	The reason that we need to break out a stage here for this, and the reason that I haven't done it in the past, is because this material is largely assumed that you already know it.
65000	67000	And I do want to tell a story about this.
67000	73000	So I was teaching private school coding camp, an after school coding camp, about 45 people at a private school,
73000	77000	and none of them could install software on their computers.
77000	82000	They all had different computers. Some of them was Windows, some was Mac, and then some of them had admin access so they could do the installation.
82000	86000	Some couldn't. Some had to ask their mom and dad to do it for them. It was a mess.
86000	90000	And I realized that most adults have already covered this base.
90000	96000	It is interesting to note that when I actually did help out at the community college for a while when I was, you know, mentoring there,
96000	101000	that so many of the people that were coming to the labs in the community college had never even used a computer.
101000	108000	I know that that seems interesting to say, but there is still a huge digital divide in America.
108000	114000	And there are still people in America who do not have a computer, and they do not know how to operate them.
114000	117000	It's less than less a thing, but it is still a thing.
117000	126000	So breaking out these skills and knowing how to use a computer and how the internet works, how to install a browser, how to install software safely,
126000	133000	how to deal with viruses, how to not get owned at a basic level as a general computer user.
133000	142000	These are all really essential skills, and you may be one of the lucky ones who was raised by, you know, a family that gave you free reign on the family PC
142000	146000	and let you install and they re-imaged every once in a while, which we'll do a video about that.
146000	150000	What is the best strategy for helping somebody learn these skills at a young age,
150000	160000	and how do you give them the motivation and the sort of reign that they need to be able to mess around and explore safely on the computer?
160000	165000	But, so when I talk about basic computer skills, this is what we're really talking about, and I'm just going to summarize it really quickly.
165000	170000	We're talking about learning how to type, we're talking about, you know, purchasing a computer and only one computer to get,
170000	175000	whether to get a Mac or a Linux machine, whether, I'm sorry, a Mac or a Linux machine,
175000	181000	or in this case, mostly a Mac or a Windows machine, why you might want one or the other, you know, that sort of question.
181000	184000	If you're just getting into tech, you may not even know the right answer there.
184000	190000	So, and then stuff like, how do you install software on Windows? How do you install software on a Mac safely?
190000	195000	What are the different methods of that? How do you use the Internet? What is the Internet? Is the web the Internet?
195000	198000	I mean, these are questions that people literally don't know the answers to.
198000	202000	So, I know a lot of you watching this video are like, why is he even doing this video?
202000	208000	But it's super important that you have this handle, understanding your developer editor options.
208000	214000	I do think knowing how to edit files on your computer, whether it's simple text, no pad, or VS code,
214000	218000	which I think everybody should know how to install, that becomes an issue, right?
218000	223000	Because you've got to be able to edit files without knowing anything else, any of the fancy terminal stuff that we're going to learn later.
224000	230000	You know, proton mail accounts, Gmail, where do you go for email? Why do you go there for email?
230000	234000	We already talked about how the Internet works. How does mail work? How does it get shipped around?
234000	241000	How do web pages actually work? And that kind of thing. How do I take notes reliably and safely that can be backed up?
241000	245000	How do I back up my computer? How do I develop search-centric habits like Alt-Tab?
245000	249000	Do you know how to do Alt-Tab? Have you ever seen it before? You know how many people don't?
249000	252000	How about the spotlight bar? Knowing how to use the spotlight bar to save your time?
252000	258000	These are all skills that involve basic computer usage, which are not taught anywhere.
258000	262000	They may be taught in some school systems in some community college, but they're generally not taught.
262000	269000	LeverJI Assistance, that's a new thing, being able to ask ChatGPT online or on the computer to help you out.
269000	274000	These are things that we, you know, more and more are being assumed as basic computer skills.
274000	278000	So that change, that has been broken out.
278000	282000	I'm not going to be able to cover all this material anymore because we've already moved past it.
282000	291000	We're going to try to stay on the schedule which has us doing websites, creating basic website stuff for another week or two.
291000	296000	So we're going to be doing all of that stuff, but please be sure to check back if you want to see the videos that are being made there.
296000	302000	Where are those videos made? The videos are made during morning boost time when I feel like it.
302000	304000	That's when we're going to be making them.
304000	309000	But other than that, we're going to be trying to catch up as many videos as we can during the beginner boost radio time on Saturdays.
309000	312000	And we're going to continue to dedicate that four hour block making these kind of videos.
312000	317000	So that is, that will hopefully catch you up with where we are.
317000	325000	And I will link this video from the opening page of the beginner boost so people can know why it's changed perhaps.
325000	327000	And that's all.
