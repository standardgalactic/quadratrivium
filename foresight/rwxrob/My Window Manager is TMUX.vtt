WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.300
One of the things I get asked all the time is what my window manager is I get that I don't know what this is about people

00:05.300 --> 00:09.320
Obsessed about window managers and distros and stuff. It's fine. People are just making conversation

00:10.160 --> 00:12.160
Rarely they're judging you based on your choices

00:12.960 --> 00:17.240
to me it doesn't matter as my window manager is Tmux and

00:18.480 --> 00:21.840
Do I use a status bar? I use my Tmux status bar

00:21.920 --> 00:27.640
So as you can see right now everything that you see on the screen is Tmux. This is a full-screen

00:28.120 --> 00:35.240
Nome terminal that came with pop OS is my distro and I have got a Tmux within a Tmux

00:35.240 --> 00:37.240
So this stuff down here is all we chat

00:37.640 --> 00:42.920
This down here is my status bar. This is a status update my pulmonary trauma on my Tmux configuration

00:42.920 --> 00:45.360
Which we're going to be covering in other videos. So stay tuned

00:45.920 --> 00:47.920
And then here's my title down here

00:48.640 --> 00:54.400
You can't see it, but and then up here you can see this is this is up here. This is a Vim session

00:55.120 --> 00:58.520
And up here you can see that I have another Tmux status bar

00:58.520 --> 01:03.120
That's because I have a Tmux within a Tmux and stay tuned. I'll show you how to do that safely

01:04.120 --> 01:08.840
So that you can actually have two status bars or you can split your screen and do all kinds of crazy amazing things with this

01:09.280 --> 01:11.280
so by using

01:12.400 --> 01:16.320
By what's that can use it to previous CPU usage and other things absolutely

01:16.320 --> 01:20.840
I can do all of that from the command line if I wanted if I wanted to put CPU utilization or anything

01:20.840 --> 01:24.320
I wanted to I could put it in my terminal in my in my in my

01:24.400 --> 01:28.840
You know status bars of different types so I could put it up here or I could make a pain

01:28.840 --> 01:33.800
I can do this so I can split a pain over here. So easily. I just split that pain in half

01:34.040 --> 01:37.720
That's pain management. And then if I want a new window control C

01:38.320 --> 01:40.320
Let me turn my eskies on so you can see everything

01:40.720 --> 01:46.840
But as you can see I can go back and forth screen and tell it multiplexers I can split this guy some more

01:46.840 --> 01:49.280
I can make T matrix here run

01:50.160 --> 01:57.200
You know, I can put the fish in another terminal the point being that I have absolute immediate control

01:57.760 --> 02:04.120
Over all of my windows and pains people continually say you need to learn I3 you're learning blah blah blah

02:04.120 --> 02:11.280
I say no, I don't need any of that all I need is Tmux because Tmux gets you everything you need I

02:11.880 --> 02:16.200
Do everything from the terminal anyway, so there's no need for me to do anything besides that

02:16.680 --> 02:22.720
It does manage my windows it matters my real estate it manages my pains

02:22.720 --> 02:28.360
It allows me to do I mean I can do H top over here if I want to have that thing sometimes in another window

02:28.360 --> 02:33.920
I'll roll I'll run my other thing and and by the way all the bindings that I have here are also

02:34.920 --> 02:38.120
Completely transferable, right? So it's like

02:39.240 --> 02:41.240
configuration centralized and

02:42.440 --> 02:43.880
Portable

02:43.880 --> 02:49.240
In a single file, so you know your Tmux config if I'm doing like I don't know

02:49.240 --> 02:54.680
I'm good planning on doing the Kubernetes certification and I know that they have Tmux so that odds are I can take my

02:54.680 --> 02:58.880
Tmux com files stick it on the system along with my batch RC and my Vim are seeing I'm good to go

02:58.880 --> 03:05.640
I don't care do it. Could I install I3 on there? No, could I you know change my Linux distro?

03:05.680 --> 03:09.040
No, let's say that I want to just run a Docker container

03:09.120 --> 03:14.520
So, you know, let's say I'm going to run it's like the fault Docker container Docker run it

03:14.520 --> 03:19.680
You know, let's like run it a bunch of container, right dash dash RM and

03:20.520 --> 03:25.520
Let's give it a name. Let's do Debian and what we should we call it?

03:27.120 --> 03:31.320
What is it? How do you do names in I think it is something I don't remember so

03:31.920 --> 03:35.760
Oh, fairly crazy because that shouldn't actually not found. Oh wait

03:36.640 --> 03:39.800
I think it's dash and something so Debian

03:41.160 --> 03:47.720
Is it dash T dash T is the name. I thought it was dash and is it dash T

03:52.400 --> 03:57.320
What is it people I think it's dash dash and

03:58.440 --> 04:02.280
Name I know there's a shortcut. Okay. So here we are on here, right?

04:02.520 --> 04:06.440
So so now I can like I have my I have my host here and

04:07.960 --> 04:10.120
It didn't seem to work. So we'll just go ahead and use this

04:10.240 --> 04:16.240
So let's say I want to put my team looks config over here. I want to put my my team looks good thing. So Docker copy

04:18.040 --> 04:20.040
This

04:20.400 --> 04:25.480
Tmux comf and I want to put it on this. Yeah

04:26.760 --> 04:29.520
I also structure. What am I talking about Docker copy?

04:30.520 --> 04:33.640
Oh wait, where is my team looks file? Did I put it someplace else? Oh

04:34.800 --> 04:36.800
there is

04:36.840 --> 04:40.640
Tmux comf to am I doing it wrong? What am I doing wrong? I

04:42.880 --> 04:47.320
Think I have to put slash there. Yeah, there we go. So now it's here

04:48.120 --> 04:52.320
So over here. I don't have Tmux. So you have to update

04:54.160 --> 04:56.160
Damn it have to update

04:57.160 --> 04:59.160
a

04:59.200 --> 05:01.200
app install

05:01.520 --> 05:03.520
Tmux

05:03.520 --> 05:08.000
Yes, I want to install Tmux. Let's see how fast this goes. I start Tmux over here and

05:08.640 --> 05:11.760
It didn't pull up my my thing yet. So let's see if it's still there

05:12.560 --> 05:16.840
Is it there? Yep, there it is. So where's my home directory root? Okay, here we go

05:17.120 --> 05:22.840
move slash Tmux comf to dot and now Tmux. Oopsy

05:23.400 --> 05:25.400
Get out of that Tmux

05:25.640 --> 05:27.840
It should pick it up. It doesn't look like it is. I

05:28.680 --> 05:32.680
Just not picking it up. Let me see if I can do it Tmux. Was it dash C? I

05:34.040 --> 05:36.160
Got it. I don't remember what it is. I didn't plan this

05:37.760 --> 05:39.760
So

05:39.800 --> 05:41.800
We talking about oh, there's no man page

05:42.840 --> 05:44.960
All right, so Tmux is it dash C

05:46.840 --> 05:52.320
Dot Tmux com the point is you can use Tmux on it if I can't get it you can you get what I'm saying

05:52.560 --> 05:54.560
This is file directory

05:56.240 --> 05:58.520
We talking about oh, there we go

06:00.520 --> 06:05.080
Set that show yeah, I know you didn't think you were gonna get to see me docker fail this whole time, did you?

06:05.600 --> 06:08.520
No, since file directory what the oh wait?

06:10.360 --> 06:14.920
Sashay, I don't know. I see it right there. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. I

06:16.280 --> 06:20.120
Wanted to reload my Tmux and it's not loading it. Come on load my Tmux. Please load it

06:20.620 --> 06:21.800
Uh

06:21.800 --> 06:26.960
Okay, well it's loading something. It's loading something. I don't think that's the right thing

06:26.960 --> 06:33.200
But it's loading something the point is you can take your configuration with you and and you can change it up and

06:33.960 --> 06:36.400
And just copy between doctors containers and something that

06:37.400 --> 06:42.320
I don't know here. Let's try this man Docker. Let's I don't I don't I don't have two minutes left

06:42.320 --> 06:46.920
So let's try this man Tmux. Wait, we're gonna go into the Tmux conference after this. So

06:47.840 --> 06:51.240
Man Tmux, let me go see if I can look up the comp

06:52.960 --> 06:57.080
No dash C is a show command, of course silly me silly me

06:58.920 --> 07:00.760
Where's the configuration file

07:00.760 --> 07:04.160
By default Tmux was a configuration file from Etsy Tmux.com

07:04.840 --> 07:09.160
It looks for a user configuration file at till the does that mean it because there's no user over here

07:09.160 --> 07:10.160
Is that way?

07:10.160 --> 07:14.600
Cuz cuz cuz it looks like there's one there. Okay, let's just add user

07:14.920 --> 07:20.000
You you password you you

07:21.120 --> 07:22.480
Yes

07:22.480 --> 07:24.480
you you

07:24.560 --> 07:25.720
Yes

07:25.720 --> 07:27.720
All right as you dash you

07:28.360 --> 07:29.960
copy

07:29.960 --> 07:31.960
root dot Tmux dot

07:32.760 --> 07:34.760
Comf to here

07:35.280 --> 07:37.280
First denied

07:38.560 --> 07:42.400
All right, well, let's try this schmocks schmod

07:43.080 --> 07:44.840
Plus are

07:44.840 --> 07:48.120
It doesn't have sudo built-in. I have to install sudo

07:48.680 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, so that's why I'm doing it. I know this is what you get when you get bear bound container

07:54.000 --> 08:00.400
I actually have configure containers, but you get the point cannot operate on a dangling sim link. How are you a sim link?

08:02.680 --> 08:04.680
You're not a sim link

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
All right, fine

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
I'm gonna change this

08:09.920 --> 08:11.280
Let's do this

08:11.280 --> 08:15.360
Yep, let's just give me my copy. I'm gonna copy it to

08:15.960 --> 08:17.160
slash

08:17.160 --> 08:19.720
home slash you have it that and

08:21.240 --> 08:23.440
Now we can do it exit Tmux

08:24.480 --> 08:27.120
Damn it. Oh wait, let's do that you

08:28.040 --> 08:29.560
Tmux

08:29.560 --> 08:35.080
Still listen kidding it. I don't understand why make it make it go away. Wait did it?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.640
Am I using the right Tmux file even?

08:38.640 --> 08:43.960
You guys like it when I screw up anyway, don't you? I mean, that's your favorite thing to watch no vi I

08:46.520 --> 08:48.600
Could use Ed's not even here is that out here. I

08:50.760 --> 08:52.760
Think it is damn it

08:54.400 --> 08:56.400
Damn not even Ed I

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
Didn't seem like it though. You saw that, right?

08:59.960 --> 09:03.480
You did you see that? I did not seem like it. So apps

09:04.600 --> 09:06.600
So then minimal

09:08.320 --> 09:10.320
I don't need the rest

09:10.760 --> 09:13.440
Is it Vim's tiny is it Vim tiny?

09:15.840 --> 09:19.680
Yeah, that's it okay, I could remember the sim link came from the host

09:25.080 --> 09:27.080
You

09:27.280 --> 09:29.280
LS-J oh

09:30.440 --> 09:32.080
You guys

09:32.080 --> 09:37.980
Finally cracked it for me. I feel so silly of course it did

09:38.800 --> 09:43.360
It's like trying to link to things that don't exist. I'm 14 seconds over. Can I do it?

09:43.360 --> 09:47.280
Pomo just shut up for a second. Okay? Okay, Pomo. Thank you. All right, so

09:48.480 --> 09:55.600
CD into dot files. All right, let's do this. So cop be good to the Tmux the Tmux

09:56.320 --> 09:58.320
Uh

09:58.680 --> 10:03.720
Doctor yeah, yeah, thank you. You guys cracked it. This is more fun that way when I screw up, right?

10:03.720 --> 10:10.160
You can know the do the perils of using symbolic links. All right, so docker copy

10:10.600 --> 10:12.600
dot Tmux dot com

10:13.360 --> 10:16.480
To this thing whatever this is I

10:17.920 --> 10:21.320
Didn't take my name because I got the command wrong because look I can't remember shit

10:21.360 --> 10:23.340
That's just how I am. All right, so they went up

10:24.760 --> 10:31.080
We do colon slash home slash you and I have a better feeling about this

10:31.080 --> 10:33.080
I just do I just have a better feeling

10:33.680 --> 10:35.080
LS-L

10:35.080 --> 10:38.240
LS-LA. Oh god LS-L

10:41.000 --> 10:42.480
Tmux

10:42.480 --> 10:47.560
Huzzah, there's my Tmux that I know and love it's got my own things here

10:47.560 --> 10:55.760
It's got all my bindings. It can turn my clock on. Where's the clock though? There's my refresh thingy. Anyway, as you can see

10:55.760 --> 11:02.720
You get your Tmux and yes, I had problems because other reasons not because it was hard to get Tmux over there

11:03.760 --> 11:07.480
So hopefully that's that's just helping that can make the case for you to consider

11:08.520 --> 11:10.520
Using a window manager. That's just Tmux

11:10.840 --> 11:12.240
and

11:12.240 --> 11:14.440
You know, you can you can you can put it on anything

11:15.120 --> 11:22.820
And put it on anything. So I'll let's just review configuration centralized and portable single file. You can put it on anything

11:25.360 --> 11:29.360
Can be configured to behave

11:30.480 --> 11:34.280
Like a screen which has come on every system since it's on a time

11:35.440 --> 11:38.120
It's extremely powerful. I

11:38.920 --> 11:47.560
Cannot even begin to tell you how powerful it is powerful and configurable even if you don't buy into the plug-in stuff, which I don't I

11:49.520 --> 11:54.000
Avoid plug-ins because the plug-ins defeat the whole purpose of having a

11:57.120 --> 12:02.520
Because no longer portable, right if you but you can use them right no longer portable

12:03.160 --> 12:06.080
But I personally don't like them. I try to stick with the basics

12:07.000 --> 12:10.400
And it's you know, it's universally available

12:12.320 --> 12:14.320
So even

12:15.080 --> 12:17.080
During certification exams

12:17.600 --> 12:20.640
so, you know, if you're working through a web browser and

12:21.080 --> 12:27.600
You can't see what you're working on and you haven't you having to fight with the web browser already because you're doing a certification test

12:27.600 --> 12:31.400
It's a terminal-based thing and you're already using some sort of stupid ass web

12:32.120 --> 12:34.520
Emulation, you know, if you got too much in there

12:34.520 --> 12:40.880
It just makes it that much less painful because you can split the screen up and stuff like that rather than to do whatever

12:40.880 --> 12:45.040
I can't even imagine what you would do which is a single terminal if you can't if you can't split the screen

12:45.040 --> 12:46.920
You got to do two things at one time and you want to check

12:46.920 --> 12:51.480
Maybe you want your documentation open in one window, which you can you can do or you want a man page

12:51.480 --> 12:54.400
You're gonna be able to something like that, you know, then yeah, you need this

12:54.400 --> 13:00.720
You're gonna open up multiple windows, you know web web terminal tabs in order to check out your different things

13:00.720 --> 13:07.080
So there's just a million reasons to make Tmux the only window manager that you care about and

13:07.400 --> 13:14.160
I cannot overemphasize that we're gonna still talk about how to configure Tmux thing and all that and I'll move on to different videos

13:14.160 --> 13:19.760
About that, but this was supposed to be sort of a seamless demo of why you might want to use the team at the Tmux

13:20.080 --> 13:24.800
Moon image or I have to do is watch me or anybody who uses one for a short amount of time to

13:25.040 --> 13:27.800
really get a sense of why you might want to pick it up and

13:28.320 --> 13:34.360
I mean you can use it to make your own sort of monitoring station if you're a kubernetes person

13:34.360 --> 13:39.040
And we did I did this at work the other day where we had a bunch of things that we're watching at CD health checks

13:39.120 --> 13:45.960
We had some pings running in other windows and it was all in this beautiful big split-screen console with no annoying borders in between

13:45.960 --> 13:49.120
Other than like the one, you know terminal border in between the whole thing

13:49.120 --> 13:53.800
so that's my that's my argument for using Tmux give it a shot and

13:54.360 --> 13:57.800
We're gonna proceed with some other videos about configuration and stuff like that

13:58.840 --> 14:02.480
We're gonna talk about oh persistent sessions, right? I forgot about that

14:03.480 --> 14:07.080
So Tmux also allows you to have a persistent session

14:08.920 --> 14:13.360
I'm gonna do a different video about persistent sessions though. So watch for that
