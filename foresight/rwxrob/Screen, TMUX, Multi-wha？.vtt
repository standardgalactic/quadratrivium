00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Okay, people, I've had a number of people ask me how to do T-Mux and whether to use it

00:07.400 --> 00:13.800
and what it's about, and actually some people like me have struggled with the defaults.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.800
Don't feel bad.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.800
A lot of people do.

00:15.800 --> 00:22.000
Particularly people who have come to it from another terminal multiplexer called Screen.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
So I want to first of all, I want to talk about Screen.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.400
I want to talk about the very first multiplexer, what a multiplexer is.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.400
Screen is, what T-Mux is, and why you should care, and how you should use it.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.400
Hopefully this will go pretty quickly.

00:37.400 --> 00:42.400
If I go too fast for you, you can always redo it, or you can come get on our stream.

00:42.400 --> 00:48.400
rwxrob.live will take it to our YouTube, and then you can go to our Twitch if you have a question.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.400
And our communities will be happy to help you.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.400
So let's start out with talking about what it is.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.400
So I'm going to pull up a terminal.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.400
That's a pretty busy terminal.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.400
We've been doing a lot of stuff here, so I'll get that out of the way.

01:02.400 --> 01:08.400
And I'm going to minimize these windows for now.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.400
I'll bring them back, don't you worry.

01:10.400 --> 01:15.400
So we have a terminal here, and I'm going, you can probably see it,

01:15.400 --> 01:20.400
but I'm going to go ahead and boom-bump up the font just a little bit more, as you can see.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.400
So this is a standard terminal.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.400
This is a standard BASH terminal running BASH4 right now.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.400
If you have five or whatever, what we're about to do will work with any shell.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.400
So first of all, I want to introduce you to something called screen.

01:35.400 --> 01:40.400
So from a terminal, you type in, and we're not going to cover terminals today, so we're just going to type screen.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.400
So the screen program comes by default on all unixies by default.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.400
Any unices, anything older than 10, 15 years.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.400
But it's been since kind of removed because it's sort of optional,

01:52.400 --> 01:55.400
and generally speaking, people will use Tmux instead.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.400
Why does screen matter? Isn't this video about Tmux?

01:58.400 --> 02:01.400
Well, it's kind of about both, and this is why.

02:01.400 --> 02:07.400
So if you ever want to get the benefits of screen, which I'll go into right now,

02:07.400 --> 02:14.400
you want to always configure screen.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.400
Let me get it installed.

02:17.400 --> 02:21.400
There we go.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.400
Being a long password, sorry for that.

02:25.400 --> 02:32.400
We're going to install screen, and however, screen usually comes on most systems.

02:32.400 --> 02:39.400
And the reason I'm going to tell you about screen is because you should learn screen at the same time that you learn Tmux,

02:39.400 --> 02:46.400
because if your priority is working productively on a terminal on any computer in the world,

02:46.400 --> 02:51.400
including, you know, ancient SCO systems, AIX, Solaris, all of that,

02:51.400 --> 02:56.400
then you really need to learn the world's oldest multiplexer.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.400
So what does multiplexer mean?

02:58.400 --> 03:01.400
Plex means screen, right?

03:01.400 --> 03:04.400
Or, you know, something to look through.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.400
You can think of like Cineplex, right?

03:06.400 --> 03:09.400
Multiple cinema screens.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.400
So multiplexer is a way to deal with multiple screens.

03:12.400 --> 03:18.400
Screen was the first multiplexer, and it was created to deal with the situation where you have one, you know,

03:18.400 --> 03:23.400
green cathode ray monitor, and you can't do anything else on it.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.400
You only have that one terminal, and God help you if you need to do anything else,

03:27.400 --> 03:30.400
because you only have one terminal, period.

03:30.400 --> 03:36.400
And so I would, so, you know, like right now, if I only have one terminal, I can't really do anything else, actually.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.400
In order for me to properly test this, I need to fire up a different terminal.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.400
So I'm going to do that properly.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
So this is a better simulation.

03:44.400 --> 03:51.400
It's a little small, but this is a better simulation of what you might experience in 1978, let's say.

03:51.400 --> 03:57.400
Or, you know, even all the way through the 90s and early 2000s, before T-Mux was invented.

03:57.400 --> 04:02.400
I'm trying to make my font sizes increase, and I can't remember how to do it.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.400
Oh, there it is.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.400
Yeah, so it's just, this is a lacquerty.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.400
In case you haven't know, this was written in Rust.

04:09.400 --> 04:19.400
So I'm going to actually leave it at 80 by 80 on purpose, because, or relatively close to that.

04:19.400 --> 04:24.400
Just to kind of give you the simulation of what it's like to just pretend you have a terminal only.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.400
This big old long prompt is not anything you would ever have at that time.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.400
But that's fine.

04:29.400 --> 04:35.400
In fact, I normally prefer a smaller prompt, but for the streaming, I have a kind of fun, big long one.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.400
All right, we're clearly going to be interrupted a little bit by home noises here.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
I hope that's okay.

04:41.400 --> 04:47.400
Okay, so next let's do, let's use, let's simulate the problem.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.400
So I'm doing LS, maybe I'm running top.

04:50.400 --> 04:57.400
My version of top, you might know this is more your version of top user, user bin top.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.400
So you're running top, and you know, this is old school top.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.400
You can see like something's really pegging my CPU.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.400
It's probably OBS.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
You know, like, oh, that's really great.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.400
But how do I do something else while top is running?

05:10.400 --> 05:16.400
You know, so in this particular environment, you have to close something down, and then you have to restart something else.

05:16.400 --> 05:26.400
If I want to do LS or if I want to do, I don't know, PS-EF, and then I want to grep the number for the PID to see what's causing all the hassle.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.400
So I do, you know, grep 539 so I can find it.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.400
So that's a pretty standard thing.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.400
Okay, well, it might have changed in the meantime, right?

05:33.400 --> 05:39.400
So maybe I want to leave it running and I want to be able to switch back and forth between the two really quickly.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.400
Well, I can't, unless you're really fast typist, you know, you can't really do that.

05:42.400 --> 05:48.400
So it would be really great if I had two windows or two sort of half windows, even if you could do that.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.400
And that's really the difference between screen and Tmux.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.400
So screen was the first thing invented to create multiple windows.

05:56.400 --> 06:02.400
And by typing screen, you're able to start, it starts up and then you have to push enter or something.

06:02.400 --> 06:07.400
And it'll come up and it'll give you, it'll give you your prompt.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.400
Now, it also threw out my colors and everything.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
That's interesting. I wasn't expecting that to happen.

06:12.400 --> 06:20.400
So that means that when you're running under screens, since it is so old, it doesn't have support for color, two to six colors and all the other things that you might normally have support for.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.400
So here we are.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.400
And I have my terminal, at least I have, you know, a window.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.400
Well, why does this thing?

06:27.400 --> 06:30.400
So now I can run top my, well, that's really crazy.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
Why does that top work?

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
Right? The other one doesn't.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
I don't know.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.400
That's kind of a fun, fun thing.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
I'll have to figure that out.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.400
So user been top.

06:37.400 --> 06:45.400
And when we run user been top, we have this, but now while this is running, I can actually do control a and then type C.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.400
Pardon me.

06:55.400 --> 07:03.400
I don't know if it's safe to talk again.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
I'll go ahead.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.400
I'm going to have to clip the video.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
They don't know what I'm here.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.400
I'm torturing them.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.400
I need a better studio.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.400
Um, all right.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.400
So when I do this, I get no other window.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.400
There's no other window.

07:18.400 --> 07:24.400
So that was me doing control a, a, but if I do control a, C, it creates a new window.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.400
And I can see all my windows with control a, w.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.400
And so down below it says you have, there's a, there's a window zero, there's a zero and a one.

07:33.400 --> 07:39.400
And I can switch between the windows by doing control a, zero, control a, one.

07:39.400 --> 07:44.400
You can name them and do all kinds of things, but fundamentally that's how you get around.

07:44.400 --> 07:52.400
If you want to toggle between the two windows, you do control a, a, control a, a, and I'm just holding control down and tapping a twice.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
So I can do that really fast.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.400
So if I wanted to, I could go back here and see, okay, five, three, nine, nine.

07:57.400 --> 08:05.400
I can go over here, PSDF, grep, five, three, nine, nine to see what's, whoops, wrong one, five, three, nine, nine.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.400
And I could go back over here and see what's going on.

08:07.400 --> 08:13.400
I could even kill it, which I won't do because I don't know what it is, but you know what, you see my point.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.400
So I can go through here.

08:14.400 --> 08:18.400
I can even add another window, control a, c again, control a, c.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.400
And now I can control a, w.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
You can see them all here.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.400
And I can pick one.

08:23.400 --> 08:28.400
So control a, one, control a, what was it, zero, control a and two.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
So now I have all of these windows.

08:30.400 --> 08:38.400
No, you're probably wondering, well, wouldn't it be great if I could split the window in half and then do something with the window?

08:38.400 --> 08:42.400
And that is where we run into a problem.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.400
But before we go there, I'm going to talk about that later with me talk about Tmux.

08:45.400 --> 08:50.400
There are two great advantages for screen, two main reasons that screen was created.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.400
The first is what I told you, managing screen real estate and windows.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.400
So you're able to go back and forth between your windows pretty easily.

08:58.400 --> 09:06.400
So control a is how you go between the two windows in screen.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.400
And it's always, and since the dawn of time, the default of screen is control a.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
Okay.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.400
And so that's all well and good.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.400
But here's something you might not have thought about.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.400
So let's pretend that I lose my connection.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.400
Okay.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.400
Let's pretend.

09:23.400 --> 09:30.400
Now this is going to be a little tricky because I have, I'm trying to put two windows.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.400
I'm trying to simulate.

09:31.400 --> 09:39.400
So for example, let's pretend I'm remotely connected to a system in New York or something like a digital ocean server and or any server really.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.400
And, and so let's pretend like I lose the connection.

09:42.400 --> 09:48.400
Well, you could either lose the connection by having someone click X and like, oh crap, I had that background.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
I have been running that compile for the last hour.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.400
I've been running this background process forever.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
I've been running a backup system.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.400
And so you're, you're dead, right?

09:58.400 --> 10:02.400
I mean, and if you're working remotely, that's really, really dangerous.

10:02.400 --> 10:08.400
If you're, I did, I worked remotely for, I've been for 10 years, one of the office, maybe five times out of that entire time.

10:08.400 --> 10:17.400
And because of that, if, if something were to go wrong in one case, they actually, truly I lost my power during a meal and really important process.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.400
And if I had not been running screen, I would be sad.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.400
It's the same at least.

10:22.400 --> 10:32.400
So, so what you can do is you can do screen, screen dash LS and it'll show you all the screens that you have.

10:32.400 --> 10:37.400
And then you can reconnect to that screen by doing screen.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.400
I don't remember the screen command.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.400
I'm going to have to look it up.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
I use, because I know the team looks one though.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
What is it?

10:43.400 --> 10:44.400
Is it dash R guys?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.400
Is it dash R?

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
I think it's reattached.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.400
Yep, that's it.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.400
So now I can do control AW.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.400
And there you see all of my stuff is still there.

10:53.400 --> 10:59.400
And my top is even running still, still the same, same exact process.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.400
The process has never stopped running.

11:01.400 --> 11:09.400
Now, if I want to, if I know I'm going to leave and I don't want to just close my window, I can actually forcibly detach with the control AD.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.400
And that detaches from the session.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.400
So screen dash LS.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.400
Okay, so you can see I've got a running session.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.400
It's a good idea to do that no matter what.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
If you do screen, I think it's dash X.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.400
I think that will automatically connect to the last available screen.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.400
That's another one you can do.

11:25.400 --> 11:31.400
So you can read about screen and all of its specifics, but I just kind of want to overview for you how it works.

11:31.400 --> 11:38.400
And the reason I'm telling you about screen first is because this is going to directly affect how you configure Tmux.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.400
And you'll understand why now.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
So control AD, I'm going to disconnect that.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.400
Actually, I think I'm probably just going to close down all those screens.

11:47.400 --> 11:52.400
There is one other advantage of screen that I cannot demonstrate without being on a multi-user system.

11:52.400 --> 12:00.400
But if more than one person is logged into the same account and they connect to the same screen session, they literally share a keyboard.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
It's the same. They can type.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
The other person can backspace it out.

12:04.400 --> 12:11.400
And so if you're doing any pair programming of that kind or if you're doing any root cause analysis or any hacking of any kind,

12:11.400 --> 12:15.400
all of those things can be shared directly or even education.

12:15.400 --> 12:21.400
I've used this a lot for education because I've allowed somebody to type something and then told them over the phone or over Discord,

12:21.400 --> 12:23.400
this is what you need to type.

12:23.400 --> 12:28.400
So that's a third kind of way to use screen and or Tmux.

12:28.400 --> 12:40.400
But the two primary reasons to use screen and Tmux are to manage different windows and real estate and to provide a connection that's still going to be running.

12:40.400 --> 12:44.400
So one practical application of that, by the way, is to run a Minecraft server.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.400
So Minecraft server, I get this a lot because I deal with a lot of people who like that.

12:48.400 --> 12:55.400
And Minecraft servers are fundamentally unable to handle, you know, they have a terminal and all that stuff.

12:55.400 --> 13:01.400
But when they're running from a Linux system or a unique system of any kind, they don't have a very intelligent terminal.

13:01.400 --> 13:08.400
So what you have to do is you run screen or Tmux first and then you start up your Minecraft.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
And then when you want to come back to it, you reconnect to it.

13:10.400 --> 13:16.400
If you start Minecraft up and you disconnect, you know, you lose it, right?

13:16.400 --> 13:22.400
And because Minecraft is not a truly integrated server like a web server or mail server or something like that,

13:22.400 --> 13:28.400
that's really the preferred way to do it as opposed to making a full blown server out of it.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.400
Okay, so let's let's move on to Tmux.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.400
So let me first kill all of my screen processes.

13:34.400 --> 13:39.400
I'm going to start up screen dash x, by the way, what happens if I start screen without a dash x?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.400
I start up a new session, right?

13:41.400 --> 13:44.400
This is a really common problem I see all the time.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
People forget to do dash x or dash r.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.400
And so then they end up with this like, where's my session?

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
It's not there. It actually is there.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.400
Now you have two sessions, right?

13:54.400 --> 13:58.400
So I'm going to just do screen dash x and to pick up the last session.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.400
It's like, see the screen screen is actually a little dumber than Tmux.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.400
It's like, I don't know which one you want, dude, which one do you want to connect to?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.400
So it's like, okay, so let's do dash r.

14:06.400 --> 14:10.400
And then we'll do let's see ptspid.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.400
I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste this.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
I'm going to cheat.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.400
You couldn't do that on the old terminals.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.400
But so now here's my thing and I'm going to cancel this.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.400
I'm going to exit and I'm going to exit this.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.400
I'm going to exit here.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.400
And now screen is completely and totally terminated.

14:25.400 --> 14:29.400
If you haven't noticed, screen doesn't give you much indication that that you're using it.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.400
So you have to kind of check whether you're using it or not.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.400
And I actually like that it doesn't get in your way.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.400
As far as you know, it's just another screen, just another terminal.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.400
And that you're going to see is a significant difference from the default Tmux settings.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.400
Okay, so let's move to Tmux now.

14:45.400 --> 14:50.400
When you're running Tmux, you have a similar situation.

14:50.400 --> 14:56.400
I had a little bit of a problem here because I have configured my Tmux already.

14:56.400 --> 15:03.400
So I'm actually going to break my Tmux for a second in order to just use the default.

15:04.400 --> 15:14.400
I don't know what to even call Tmux to goodtmux.com.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.400
So by doing that, I have broken my Tmux configuration.

15:18.400 --> 15:23.400
There is a screen configuration, but I've never seen it used

15:23.400 --> 15:28.400
and it really doesn't make sense to do anything with screen in terms of configuring it

15:28.400 --> 15:31.400
because screen is so universal.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.400
Screen does also have some ancient, they probably fixed them all by now,

15:35.400 --> 15:40.400
but it didn't have some ancient system situations where it might mess with memory or stuff.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
And so Tmux came along.

15:42.400 --> 15:47.400
Tmux is a great project, which probably spent a little time talking about where to get it.

15:47.400 --> 15:52.400
For the most part, you just do sudo apt install Tmux, but these days it's on everything.

15:52.400 --> 15:57.400
I'm just going to do a quick search on duck.go for Tmux to see what's out there.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.400
So Tmux is a multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems.

16:01.400 --> 16:05.400
So Tmux is basically the descendant of screen.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.400
But there's some pretty significant design problems that the Tmux team made

16:09.400 --> 16:14.400
that I go back and forth between hating and loving.

16:14.400 --> 16:21.400
So for the most part, when Tmux came to be, Tmux offers brings two new things to the table.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.400
One of them is that it allows you to split the screen.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.400
And when you split the screen, you can change.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.400
You know, it's designed for screens that are a little bit bigger than our standard screen.

16:33.400 --> 16:38.400
So let's make a bigger screen here and let's examine the value proposition of Tmux.

16:38.400 --> 16:45.400
So if I run Tmux, which now should be the default, I can just do Tmux and I don't get it.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.400
Wait, I think I might still be using my config.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
Let me just check.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.400
Yeah, I'm still using this.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.400
I don't think I've successfully failed to not use mine.

16:58.400 --> 17:06.400
So I'm just going to finish this video and tell you how to use Tmux by using it the way I have configured it

17:06.400 --> 17:08.400
rather than telling you how to use the default.

17:08.400 --> 17:14.400
So I'll jump right into a description of why I am choosing to use the Tmux configuration that I do use.

17:14.400 --> 17:19.400
So where did my Tmux configure?

17:19.400 --> 17:22.400
What did I rename it?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.400
Oh, good Tmux.com.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.400
Tmux.com.

17:27.400 --> 17:35.400
So the reason that I have configured my Tmux this way and you can get just let me show you right away.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.400
I've showed this in other videos, but right now it's currently in GitHub.

17:39.400 --> 17:45.400
I may move to GitLab, but right now under my config, which is github.com.

17:45.400 --> 17:51.400
You can go find my Tmux.com.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.400
It's the only file you need.

17:53.400 --> 17:59.400
And I suggest creating symbolic link from your home directory, which is where it will be picked up automatically

17:59.400 --> 18:03.400
and putting it there.

18:04.400 --> 18:09.400
And this one, it doesn't have a lot of instructions in it.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.400
This is not original by any sense.

18:13.400 --> 18:23.400
This is a configuration that I found about six years ago and I've tweaked that made Tmux behave like screen.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.400
And you might ask, well, why would you do that?

18:26.400 --> 18:29.400
Why would you want to change the defaults on Tmux?

18:29.400 --> 18:39.400
And that is a really, really interesting question because there's actually strong arguments both ways, right?

18:39.400 --> 18:48.400
If you change Tmux to behave like screen, then the muscle memory that you've developed for using screen carries over to Tmux.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.400
So that's the number one reason that I do it.

18:51.400 --> 18:58.400
So that means that I have, we'll talk about splitting panes and stuff, but it means that up, down, left, right.

18:58.400 --> 19:06.400
I mean, most importantly, the key for, they call it the prefix key is not control B, which is the default.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.400
I've changed mine to be control A.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.400
And that's a pretty big deal.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.400
It might be controversial, but a lot of people do that.

19:14.400 --> 19:23.400
And the reason they do it is because they've been using screen their whole life or they expect that they will only have access to screen on, you know, hundreds of systems when they need it.

19:23.400 --> 19:28.400
So this is a common way to get around that problem.

19:28.400 --> 19:35.400
And then, you know, I've done some other binding where control AA does the same thing in Tmux that it did in screen.

19:35.400 --> 19:42.400
So long and short of it is this configuration is compatible with screen.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.400
So screen and Tmux are the same.

19:45.400 --> 19:50.400
Everything you do on screen for the most part is the same thing in Tmux.

19:50.400 --> 19:58.400
And then anything that's new in Tmux, I've added other more intuitive bindings.

19:58.400 --> 20:04.400
For example, I don't even remember what it is to split a pane in half, but we're about to see this.

20:04.400 --> 20:09.400
So I use this, I use a bar to split.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.400
I use a slash to split.

20:11.400 --> 20:15.400
I use a dash, which reminds me of a line to split horizontally.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.400
And I have moved my navigation to use the VI keys.

20:19.400 --> 20:28.400
So my VI keys are used to both navigate between panes and to move a pane to resize a pane.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.400
And I'll demonstrate that now.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.400
And then, of course, I have no arrow keys.

20:33.400 --> 20:38.400
I've disabled the arrow keys because I don't like allowing myself to be.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.400
And I work with young people that I don't want to pick up the habit of using arrow keys

20:42.400 --> 20:45.400
because you don't have arrow keys 90% of the time when you're on a system.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.400
That goes for VI as well.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
That's a different video.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.400
So I will go back to Alacrity and here we have our Tmux session running.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.400
My configuration of Tmux running, it's probably good we're doing this

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
because I don't even know the default Tmux keys anymore.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.400
I couldn't even tell you other than the prefixes control B.

21:03.400 --> 21:10.400
So when I split the screen, I can do control A and the pipe key or the slash key,

21:10.400 --> 21:14.400
which is right above the return key on my keyboard.

21:14.400 --> 21:21.400
And that mnemonic of being an up and down line helps me to remember that that's the split.

21:21.400 --> 21:27.400
It also helps my nine-year-olds that are learning how to use Tmux to remember it as well.

21:27.400 --> 21:32.400
If I want to split one of these in half vertically, I suppose,

21:32.400 --> 21:36.400
then I do control A and then dash or underscore.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.400
And there are a number of other things you can do here.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.400
Tmux has added quite a bit.

21:41.400 --> 21:46.400
But the fundamental addition of Tmux to screen is the fact that you have panes.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.400
The panes are much more complicated there.

21:48.400 --> 21:54.400
I've also bound control AW, which we used in screen earlier, to show you what we have.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.400
So this shows you all of the different Tmux sessions I have running on the system.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
And I can switch between the windows.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.400
But now instead of it just being switching between windows,

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
it's switching between sets of panes.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.400
So in this case, I have a set of three panes.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.400
And there's all sorts of extra fun things you can do.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.400
So you can do control A, T to show the current time.

22:15.400 --> 22:20.400
You can control A, Q to show you what size I'm doing again.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.400
It shows you where you are.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.400
You can actually swap things out.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.400
You can script all of these things too.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.400
And you can tell what size your panes are.

22:28.400 --> 22:33.400
To resize a pane, for me, is control I and then control JJJ.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.400
That goes down.

22:35.400 --> 22:39.400
Control A, control CCCC, or KKK.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.400
Control A, KKKK.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.400
Control A, HHHHH.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.400
Control A, LLL.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.400
Control A, you have to hold control down, LLLLL.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.400
Now, and to navigate between the two, instead of holding control down,

22:51.400 --> 22:58.400
I just do control AH, control AL, control A, let go K,

22:58.400 --> 23:02.400
control A, let go J, control A, let go H.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.400
So you can quickly navigate around and you can pop off, you know,

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
as many as you want.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
You can just keep going all the way.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
And you can have a lot of fun with this.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.400
I mean, you can make a little time thing down here.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.400
You can maybe do T matrix over here.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.400
You know, you can have all kinds of interesting things.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.400
You can like, I don't know, you can make, you can ask your, all sorts of things.

23:23.400 --> 23:27.400
So as you can imagine, you can really make strong, you can take it,

23:27.400 --> 23:31.400
and by the way, remember that thing with screen where you could add another window?

23:31.400 --> 23:32.400
We still have that.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.400
So if that, if that kind of screen real estate isn't good enough for you,

23:36.400 --> 23:41.400
you can still do control A, C to create a screen, just like screen.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.400
And now I have this one, right?

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
And it's a brand new one.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.400
So if I do control AA, just like screen, it goes back to my other pain set.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.400
It toggles back and forth and type exit.

23:52.400 --> 23:59.400
You can zoom in on the pain, control AZ, and it zooms in and I can do control AZ again.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
I don't recommend that.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.400
However, if you want to separate a pain out into its own window,

24:04.400 --> 24:09.400
that's control a exclamation point and that will take it out.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.400
And now it's his own window.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.400
So I can go back and forth.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
Usually that's what you want to do by the way.

24:14.400 --> 24:19.400
I've learned just through sad experience that most of the time when I want,

24:19.400 --> 24:26.400
when I think that I want to zoom, what I really want to do is have a new pain

24:26.400 --> 24:29.400
because I get over here and I forget that I'm in a zoomed in pain.

24:29.400 --> 24:33.400
And then I try to split and then I get that it splits it.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.400
And it goes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.400
Okay, I was just zoomed.

24:35.400 --> 24:41.400
So there's a difference between zooming and there's a difference between whether you're doing.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.400
How come my status bar is not the default?

24:45.400 --> 24:52.400
My status bar is not the default because I have changed all of my defaults to use Tmux.conf.

24:52.400 --> 24:58.400
So as I mentioned earlier, I'm using my own Tmux.conf, which also turns off the status bar.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.400
I am not a fan of the status bar.

25:00.400 --> 25:10.400
Again, I want it to behave just like screen and I can pull up anything that I could possibly dream of looking at from just looking at control AW.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.400
I don't need a status bar.

25:12.400 --> 25:16.400
A status bar is a distraction to me and it's unnecessary.

25:16.400 --> 25:21.400
So a lot of people disagree with that, but that's why I don't have a status bar here.

25:21.400 --> 25:26.400
But this is covered pretty much in a whirlwind fashion.

25:26.400 --> 25:31.400
What the difference between Tmux is and what's the difference between screen is.

25:31.400 --> 25:37.400
If you haven't noticed, I prefer this over multiple terminals because multiple reasons.

25:37.400 --> 25:42.400
Number one, I can just detach from it and do it remotely.

25:42.400 --> 25:54.400
So by reducing the ways that I manage my real estate on my terminal to one common way, I can use that wherever I am.

25:54.400 --> 26:03.400
So a lot of people spend a lot of time configuring their desktop manager or their window manager and they've got these really great hotkeys and they move everything around.

26:03.400 --> 26:10.400
And I find that a waste of time because I can train myself to use Tmux effectively.

26:10.400 --> 26:19.400
And as long as it's screen compatible, if I'm on another system, on another terminal someplace, I can use screen.

26:19.400 --> 26:24.400
And when I'm using screen over there, if they don't have screen, I can copy Tmux over.

26:24.400 --> 26:28.400
Unfortunately, I do have to copy my Tmux config or I'm totally lost.

26:28.400 --> 26:33.400
And that's a big argument against customizing your Tmux in the way I have.

26:33.400 --> 26:39.400
Purist might argue that using Tmux's defaults is the best way.

26:39.400 --> 26:45.400
I use Tmux like other people might use Emacs or any other IDEs.

26:45.400 --> 26:54.400
Therefore, and because it's going with screen, if I'm on a remote system, I depend more fully on screen being the same over everywhere it is.

26:54.400 --> 26:59.400
So I've deliberately not customized my screen, which you can anyway, but I haven't customized my use of screen.

26:59.400 --> 27:04.400
So if I'm on a remote system, I can at least have the base functionality there.

27:04.400 --> 27:11.400
And I allow myself the liberty of using Tmux the way I want to configure it in my particular case.

27:11.400 --> 27:16.400
And so if you like the status bar at the bottom of your Tmux, I'm not arguing against that.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.400
I'm just saying that that's just not my thing.

27:19.400 --> 27:27.400
So Tmux is actually part of four, I believe, critical command line tools.

27:27.400 --> 27:32.400
Terminal tools that make up, you know, the terminal master suite, I call it.

27:32.400 --> 27:37.400
VI for me, Tmux, Bash and Lynx.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.400
And I've done another video on why Lynx is the best web browser.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.400
It's how fast it is.

27:43.400 --> 27:49.400
When you combine those four items together, you have, I believe, the most powerful IDE in the universe.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.400
And it uses nothing but your terminal.

27:51.400 --> 27:56.400
And so when you combine those, you have to combine them properly, though.

27:56.400 --> 28:01.400
And when you combine them, then value propositions of things like Emacs kind of fade away.

28:01.400 --> 28:07.400
Because value propositions of things like NeoVim, which allow multiple paints, also fade away.

28:07.400 --> 28:13.400
I would rather have multiple single paints running Vim without needing paints through NeoVim.

28:13.400 --> 28:21.400
So my way of managing real estate is universal, as opposed to not having NeoVim on any given target system.

28:21.400 --> 28:26.400
So I would rather build a dependency on the tools that I know are going to be on the system.

28:26.400 --> 28:33.400
Because while I want to have an IDE that's powerful on my local system that's terminal based,

28:33.400 --> 28:38.400
I also want the ability to get on any system anytime and be completely functional,

28:38.400 --> 28:42.400
whether I break into that system or I'm being paid to administer it.

28:42.400 --> 28:46.400
So this is my justification for how I've configured Tmux.

28:46.400 --> 28:52.400
Just as a reminder, we went into this talking about what a multiplexer is.

28:52.400 --> 28:57.400
And then we went ahead and I showed you how to use screen and where it came from

28:57.400 --> 29:02.400
and how it's used to manage both screen real estate windows

29:02.400 --> 29:06.400
and it's also used to keep a connection up, a persistent connection.

29:06.400 --> 29:11.400
And then we went forward and we talked about how Tmux is added onto that

29:11.400 --> 29:15.400
by being able to split that real estate even further into multiple paints,

29:15.400 --> 29:18.400
even though it also has multiple windows.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.400
And then we've talked about how to integrate that into your development environment

29:21.400 --> 29:24.400
and a little bit about why you might change the defaults.

29:24.400 --> 29:29.400
The source, once again, as I end the video here is github.com.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.400
Slash rwx slash rob slash config.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.400
And if you look in there, you will find my Tmux.conf.

29:34.400 --> 29:41.400
All you need to do to get that to work is to put that Tmux.conf file in your home directory.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.400
Here, I'll list mine here now.

29:43.400 --> 29:48.400
Slash.tmux.conf.

29:49.400 --> 29:51.400
And there is mine.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.400
Oops, dash l and I'm going to use you.

29:54.400 --> 29:59.400
As you can see, my Tmux is a symbolic link that points to the Tmux

29:59.400 --> 30:02.400
in one of my github repos that I managed this way

30:02.400 --> 30:07.400
and I strongly suggest that you manage your own configuration files

30:07.400 --> 30:12.400
or dot files that way so that you don't lose them after you've configured them.

30:12.400 --> 30:17.400
All right, I hope this has been somewhat helpful and you can make sense of it.

30:17.400 --> 30:21.400
There's a lot of assumed sort of Linux knowledge going on there

30:21.400 --> 30:23.400
so if you need some help, you can look at the other videos

30:23.400 --> 30:27.400
or you can come check with our little community over on rdbxrob.

30:27.400 --> 30:31.400
And I'm going to go ahead and open up the chat now.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.400
So let me bring that back.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.400
I might have to read back for quite a bit,

30:36.400 --> 30:39.400
but I'm going to answer some specific questions here

30:39.400 --> 30:42.400
and see how far back I have to go.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.400
All right.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
Node.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.400
More of its stuff.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.400
This is essentially what I want to set up.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.400
Being able to have my dev environment on a remote machine that is always running

30:55.400 --> 30:58.400
so I can just detach detach from any of my machines

30:58.400 --> 31:02.400
when I want without losing state and I power down and close terminals.

31:02.400 --> 31:07.400
M-Tem, that is exactly, exactly why I do this.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
It's exactly why I do it.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.400
It's also why I maintain my entire configuration in a single file

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
on a Git repo so I can run curl,

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
pull the thing down onto any remote system

31:16.400 --> 31:19.400
and be instantly back where I need to be.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.400
Assuming the applications I use are on there,

31:21.400 --> 31:27.400
namely Vim, Tmux, Bash Course, and Lynx,

31:27.400 --> 31:29.400
which is a harder one to get installed,

31:29.400 --> 31:35.400
but usually I can get away with doing my searches and stuff with Lynx on a local system.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.400
Shared bindings are very useful and kind of avoid conflict.

31:38.400 --> 31:42.400
This is why most programs share bindings with Vim, right?

31:42.400 --> 31:46.400
And that's why I have configured my Tmux to use Vim bindings.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.400
My fingers know Vim.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.400
My Lynx is configured to Vim.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.400
My Bash History is configured to Vim.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.400
I would argue very strongly that the most important reason for you to use Vim

31:58.400 --> 32:03.400
is because of all the Vim bindings that are built into everything else.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.400
Every other tool has Vim bindings,

32:07.400 --> 32:11.400
and Vim bindings were created at a time when there were no mice,

32:11.400 --> 32:12.400
but that doesn't matter.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
It still makes you a thousand times more efficient

32:14.400 --> 32:18.400
because there's much less travel for your hand to go elsewhere for different things.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.400
So this is very useful. Thank you.

32:20.400 --> 32:25.400
If you can't remember that, just what is this?

32:25.400 --> 32:27.400
I'm a little bit afraid to click on it.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.400
I'm going to go ahead and do that though.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.400
Let's see if it comes up.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.400
What is this, MTem?

32:33.400 --> 32:35.400
Am I going to be sad?

32:37.400 --> 32:39.400
I clicked on it twice, so we might get two.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.400
We're just waiting for this to come up.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.400
Tmux cheat sheet.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.400
Tmux A. Oh, I see. That's nice.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
Let's bookmark that for the crowd.

32:54.400 --> 33:00.400
Okay, so MTem has shared with us a link he's found to Tmux Shortcuts and Cheat Sheet.

33:00.400 --> 33:04.400
Now, we just scratched the surface of Tmux.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.400
Tmux has an immense amount of things that can be customized,

33:08.400 --> 33:11.400
and that's one of the best parts of it,

33:11.400 --> 33:15.400
but it does make it very hard to learn even the basics.

33:15.400 --> 33:19.400
Whenever I run Tmux, it's probably really important that you understand this.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.400
I use the Tmux space A,

33:21.400 --> 33:24.400
and what A does is that reconnects to the last thing.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.400
I forgot to mention that, but that's important.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.400
After you create a Tmux session the first time,

33:29.400 --> 33:31.400
you should always use Tmux A after that,

33:31.400 --> 33:36.400
and that will force it to find and connect to the last session that was available.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.400
There's other ways to connect to different numbers.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.400
There you go.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.400
A number Tmux LS is the same as Screen LS.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.400
It's a dash LS.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.400
It shows you all the sessions.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.400
You can kill sessions and blah, blah, blah.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.400
I don't want to bog everybody down with all the stuff you can do,

33:50.400 --> 33:53.400
but there is a lot that you can do.

33:53.400 --> 33:57.400
Some of these pain-splitting things here are not relevant to me

33:57.400 --> 33:59.400
because these are the defaults.

33:59.400 --> 34:03.400
If you want to understand the defaults, there's a good link for that.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.400
I have never learned the defaults because the first moment I learned Tmux,

34:06.400 --> 34:09.400
I noticed that the keys were different than Screen,

34:09.400 --> 34:10.400
and I was like, this is ridiculous.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.400
I'm not doing this.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.400
I immediately found the other system administrators

34:14.400 --> 34:19.400
who had created configuration files that were based on Screen,

34:19.400 --> 34:21.400
and I have never looked back.

34:21.400 --> 34:24.400
I would actually completely be lost,

34:24.400 --> 34:27.400
but I'm not afraid because I know that on those systems,

34:27.400 --> 34:31.400
Screen is also there, so I always have Screen as a backup.

34:31.400 --> 34:35.400
People who use Tmux with the default bindings do not know how to use Screen.

34:35.400 --> 34:39.400
If they get on a remote system and all it has is Screen, they're done.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.400
They can't do anything.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.400
They'd have to go back and read all the commands for it.

34:44.400 --> 34:48.400
That's also a reason not to use the arrow keys and things like that in VIM.

34:48.400 --> 34:52.400
That's a reason to keep your muscle memory consistent and ubiquitous.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.400
What else we got here?

34:56.400 --> 35:02.400
How come my status bar isn't the default because I overwrote it and I turned it off?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.400
That's less of a thing, though.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
If somebody wanted that, they could keep it.

35:06.400 --> 35:11.400
I don't like giving up a full line to status stuff I'm never going to look at.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.400
M to M.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
Oh, I thought you reverted back to the default.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.400
I tried, actually.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.400
I tried to revert it, but I failed.

35:17.400 --> 35:21.400
For some reason, it didn't pick up.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.400
I don't know why.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.400
When it didn't, I went ahead and just showed you my configuration.

35:25.400 --> 35:30.400
I probably would have just flailed around not knowing what to do without this cheat sheet you provided.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.400
That's good.

35:31.400 --> 35:35.400
I like to shut off my status bar, but I also like having a visual cue of how many windows I have open.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.400
That's fine.

35:36.400 --> 35:41.400
I mentioned this already, but my way of doing that is this.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.400
I do control AW.

35:43.400 --> 35:47.400
When I want to see windows, I want to see all the windows.

35:47.400 --> 35:52.400
I don't want some little blur constantly bothering me at the bottom of the screen.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.400
When I want to know about windows, I want all the windows.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.400
I want to do control AW and see them all.

35:57.400 --> 36:02.400
That kind of thinking also applies to what I think about IntelliSense.

36:02.400 --> 36:08.400
That's when you're using an editor and it's constantly popping up help about what you can tab and get.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
I absolutely hate that.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.400
If I want to look something up, I want to look it up.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.400
I want to get examples and everything.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.400
I don't want to get constantly prompted and it's super annoying to me.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.400
Not just me.

36:19.400 --> 36:25.400
I know a lot of veteran developers and system ins who absolutely detest any form of tab completion or IntelliSense,

36:25.400 --> 36:27.400
other than the command line bash completion, of course.

36:27.400 --> 36:34.400
It's actually faster to look stuff up using links, but that's another video.

36:35.400 --> 36:39.400
I like putting system information in the status bar.

36:39.400 --> 36:52.400
I like having control A on my local Tmux and having the default control B on the remote servers with the green status bar,

36:52.400 --> 36:54.400
especially useful when I SSH.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.400
I'm glad Keisler brought that point up.

36:56.400 --> 37:01.400
That is the one pain point that I regularly have.

37:01.400 --> 37:06.400
If you do what I'm doing and you get on a remote system,

37:06.400 --> 37:11.400
if you get on the remote system and it has Tmux,

37:11.400 --> 37:19.400
it's probably a good thing that it's not using your bindings because if it were, your bindings will get stolen.

37:19.400 --> 37:24.400
It's this whole screen within a screen situation or Tmux within a Tmux situation.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.400
I don't know how many times I've been burned by that.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.400
I'm running Tmux locally on my computer to do my development,

37:30.400 --> 37:33.400
and I connect to another system and I need multiple pains and it's a remote system,

37:33.400 --> 37:35.400
so it lets me pull up another Tmux over there.

37:35.400 --> 37:39.400
Now when I do control A whatever, who gets it?

37:39.400 --> 37:41.400
The remote system? Local system?

37:41.400 --> 37:46.400
Well, the answer is the local system gets it, and that might not be what you're expecting.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.400
There's two ways to get around that.

37:48.400 --> 37:55.400
To do what Keisler says, which is go ahead and use the default bindings on the remote system,

37:55.400 --> 37:58.400
which is probably fair to say is going to be the way it's going to be

37:58.400 --> 38:01.400
because you're not going to have customized a remote system.

38:01.400 --> 38:13.400
That would make sense for you to learn the default bindings for Tmux as well as your personal bindings for Tmux locally.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
That's one way to do it.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.400
Another way to do it would be to not use Tmux remotely, use screen remotely.

38:18.400 --> 38:22.400
Nine times out of ten, when I'm connected to a remote system,

38:22.400 --> 38:26.400
I do not plan on splitting the pain on that system.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.400
I'm not going to be using the real estate.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.400
I'm going to just use screen to get multiple windows and that's it.

38:31.400 --> 38:35.400
That's still a problem because I bound control A,

38:35.400 --> 38:41.400
so now the control A is gobbled up by my local Tmux and it never makes it through to the remote screen.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.400
That is a problem.

38:43.400 --> 38:47.400
In fact, that's a pretty solid argument against the way I do it.

38:47.400 --> 38:53.400
The third way to work around it is that I maintain two different terminals.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.400
That's the one time when I might have more than one terminal.

38:56.400 --> 39:01.400
I would have alacrity running and then I would have my regular session.

39:01.400 --> 39:08.400
To tell you the truth, I like to do that anyway because I like to be very clearly mentally distinguished

39:08.400 --> 39:13.400
between my local development environment and my remote system.

39:13.400 --> 39:17.400
I have shut down, I'm not exaggerating, I'm a little embarrassed to say it.

39:17.400 --> 39:21.400
I have shut down corporate mail servers thinking I was turning my laptop off for the night,

39:21.400 --> 39:24.400
shut down dash R and out, why isn't my laptop going off?

39:24.400 --> 39:26.400
I've done that, I did that once.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.400
We had to call Ops and Boulder and have them restart it.

39:29.400 --> 39:36.400
Obviously the way to route that you pay very, very close attention to your prompts

39:36.400 --> 39:40.400
because all your prompts look the same in command line world.

39:40.400 --> 39:45.400
The system that I'm working on locally is the one that I'm all paying up and it's all Tmuxed up.

39:45.400 --> 39:51.400
I like to have a very distinct, separate terminal for any remote work

39:51.400 --> 39:58.400
because unless I'm pulling content down, then I'm clearly doing a context switch.

39:58.400 --> 40:06.400
I'm doing control tab to go between my two systems and I'm not at risk of doing that kind of screw up.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.400
I actually do that same thing on stream.

40:09.400 --> 40:16.400
I will have a terminal that is sometimes even a different application.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
In my case, no terminal.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.400
I'll use that transparently or whatever on stream.

40:21.400 --> 40:25.400
Then I'll have another terminal, an alacrity terminal or something.

40:25.400 --> 40:30.400
That will be where I do my private stuff where I'm working with schedules for my students and stuff.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.400
That way I have that separation.

40:33.400 --> 40:39.400
Over the years, I've just come to depend on that as kind of a safety net to not make that kind of mistake

40:39.400 --> 40:42.400
because I work with thousands of systems.

40:42.400 --> 40:47.400
On any given day, I could be connected to any system and a lot of times the systems were in the Fortune 500.

40:47.400 --> 40:53.400
If I were to do something like that, it could have been much more serious.

40:53.400 --> 40:58.400
As a professional, I just find it safer to have that separation.

40:59.400 --> 41:04.400
In the worst case scenario, somebody has my same bindings on a remote system.

41:04.400 --> 41:10.400
My Tmux would gobble it up and it would save me from doing something that would remind me that I'm on my local system.

41:10.400 --> 41:17.400
I'm okay with that, but it's a solid argument against doing what I'm doing and to just use the default bindings.

41:17.400 --> 41:21.400
But if you use the default bindings, it doesn't work.

41:21.400 --> 41:27.400
Because if you use the default bindings for Tmux and now you're connected to a remote system, how is that any different?

41:27.400 --> 41:31.400
The remote system has now gobbled up control A and control B.

41:31.400 --> 41:35.400
So now you're using a local system with control B and a remote system with control B.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.400
So either way, you'll have the problem.

41:38.400 --> 41:44.400
At least if you set up one differently in your personal config from the default like I've done,

41:44.400 --> 41:50.400
at least you can see that difference somewhat.

41:50.400 --> 41:58.400
And frankly, that might make it safer for you to use your local Tmux sessions to connect to remote systems

41:58.400 --> 42:01.400
rather than firing up a full separate terminal for me.

42:01.400 --> 42:09.400
But I think it's important to remember to take stock of the fact that I'm talking about just opening one extra terminal, not 10.

42:09.400 --> 42:16.400
And I've seen admins and people, in fact, I've seen streamers who fire up multiple terminals

42:16.400 --> 42:22.400
and they're talking about the best desktop managers and they're debating about which one deals with terminals the best

42:22.400 --> 42:26.400
and has managed like six or seven terminals all at the same time.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.400
And I'm just shaking my head.

42:27.400 --> 42:32.400
I'm like, guys, no, it's so much easier with Tmux.

42:32.400 --> 42:39.400
Because not only is it wicked fast, I mean, the type of speed, I'm sorry.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.400
All right.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.400
So I'll just wrap up here.

42:51.400 --> 43:01.400
So I was just going to say that you saw how fast it is to split those with Tmux.

43:01.400 --> 43:04.400
I mean, there's really no comparison.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.400
Oh, I think I just lost my stream.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.400
I did.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.400
So actually, here we go.

43:11.400 --> 43:15.400
So let me go back here.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.400
So you've seen how fast it is to just split the stream.

43:18.400 --> 43:26.400
The amount of time it takes to split a pane is way faster than it takes to fire up a new terminal.

43:26.400 --> 43:30.400
I mean, it's like ridiculously faster.

43:30.400 --> 43:35.400
And so that's objectively better than having multiple terminals.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.400
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.400
So a lot of people disagree with me.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.400
They have to have different terminals or different whatever.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.400
Lots and lots of need of them.

43:43.400 --> 43:46.400
People like, oh, if a new of them lets you have multiple panes or multiple terminals,

43:46.400 --> 43:49.400
like, okay, why would I ever do that?

43:49.400 --> 43:55.400
I mean, I can open up a new pane and open a brand new version of VI in less than two seconds.

43:55.400 --> 44:00.400
So anyway, and not to mention the fact that when you get all those hotkeys down for your new of them,

44:00.400 --> 44:03.400
none of that's going to go with you to another machine.

44:03.400 --> 44:09.400
Whereas if you have Tmux or screen on another machine, all those skills transfer.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
So.
