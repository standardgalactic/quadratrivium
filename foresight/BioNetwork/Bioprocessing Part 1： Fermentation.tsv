0	23600	We all know something about fermentation.
23600	29440	It's a process used countless times each day to make a variety of dairy products, baked
29440	31520	goods, and beverages.
31520	36960	We sometimes think of it as letting foods go bad, but in a controlled way.
36960	45160	With a little help, milk becomes yogurt, bread rises, and grains decompose, creating
45160	48920	alcoholic beverages and alternative fuels.
48920	54160	But looking at these examples only gives us a clue as to what's really happening, and
54160	60480	how we can use the power of fermentation to cost-effectively create a broad array of biological
60480	62800	products.
62800	66120	So what is fermentation?
66120	69880	A cell can be thought of as a micro-factory.
69880	77000	These cells can be bacteria, fungi, or specific cells from mammals, plants, or insects.
77000	85520	In biotechnology, these cells are used to manufacture a product in a process called fermentation.
85520	90480	For yogurt, buttermilk, and cheese, we use bacteria.
90480	96200	To make breads and alcoholic beverages, we use yeast, a fungus.
96200	101440	And the production of some vaccines require the growth of mammalian cells that are infected
101440	104080	with a specific virus.
104080	110160	The product the cells manufacture is usually a chemical the cells contain naturally, or
110160	116440	a substance that the cells have been genetically altered to create, or even a metabolic waste
116440	122040	product of the organism's growth, like one of our examples, alcohol.
122040	127800	There are too many everyday products created by commercial-scale fermentation to even list,
127800	136480	but some common ones include amino acids, biopharmaceuticals, dyes, enzymes, food products,
136480	146400	lipids, steroids, and vitamins.
146400	149480	Fermentation is a reasonably simple process.
149480	154960	A cell is selected based on its ability to produce the desired product.
154960	159720	A seedstock of cells is put into a small amount of media.
159720	165200	Media provides the nutritional products the cell needs to grow.
165200	170400	When the population of cells has grown and consumed most of the nutrients, it's moved
170400	177040	into a larger vessel with more growth media, and the process repeats.
177040	182760	This scaling up is complete when the quantity of cells is large and healthy enough to transfer
182760	189180	into a production vessel, often referred to as a bioreactor or fermenter.
189180	194440	With plenty of fresh media now available and under tightly controlled conditions, the cells
194440	197400	grow and manufacture product.
197400	203000	When the fermentation is complete, the product is harvested.
203000	207080	Fermentation is known as an upstream biotechnology process.
207080	213960	It occurs early in the production flow before recovery, purification, formulation, filling,
213960	216520	and packaging.
216520	221680	To better understand the fermentation process, we should first find out a little bit about
221680	228080	the cells we use and what they may require to reproduce and stay healthy.
228080	230660	Different cells have different needs.
230660	237380	Some are aerobic, they need oxygen, while others are anaerobic and do not require oxygen.
237380	239660	All cells require nutrition.
239660	247060	A properly formulated media contains the necessary nutrients to allow cells to grow and produce.
247060	252280	The fermenter mixes the cells evenly throughout the media to suspend the cells and supply
252280	255980	the oxygen necessary for growth.
255980	261100	Health and efficient fermentation requires rigorous monitoring and control of the environment
261100	264340	within the bioreactor.
264340	270740	Key factors include temperature, pressure, pH, which is a measure of how acidic or alkaline
270740	277740	the media is, oxygen, usually measured as dissolved oxygen within the media, and nutrient
277740	279340	levels.
279340	284060	Although the environment and the media are tailored to the needs of specific cells, the
284060	289820	life cycle of almost all batches follows a predictable pattern.
289820	299540	The growth pattern has four phases, lag, exponential, or log, stationary, and death.
299540	305700	When a cell is first introduced to fresh media, it has to adapt to its new environment.
305700	310220	This creates a lull or lag in the growth timeline.
310500	314140	After the organism adapts, the batch takes off.
314140	321140	The cells begin dividing at a constant rate, an exponential, or logarithmic, or log increase,
321140	326420	doubling, then doubling again, and on and on.
326420	332660	As the nutrients in the media are consumed, toxic metabolic waste products build up, cells
332660	336580	begin to die, and growth slows.
336580	341700	When it reaches a point that just as many cells are dying as are dividing, the batch
341700	345700	enters the stationary phase.
345700	350900	This is the point at which the key nutrients are completely consumed, the fermentation
350900	355100	is stopped, and the fermented broth is harvested.
355100	360660	If the fermentation were allowed to continue, the cells would enter the death phase.
360660	367380	Our cells die than divide, and, similar to the exponential phase, the death rate increases
367380	370380	logarithmically.
375860	381900	Now that we have a basic understanding of how fermentation works, let's look at an actual
381900	385740	process and see how it all comes together.
385740	391580	For our sample process, we will look at the production of green fluorescent protein, or
391580	392580	GFP.
392580	396820	GFP is broadly used as a biological marker.
396820	402140	It's a fluorescent dye that's very well tolerated by most cells, and doesn't interfere
402140	405340	with normal cellular function.
405340	411340	In the GFP fermentation process, we'll need to add an antibiotic to protect the purity
411340	420700	of the batch, and then, late in the process, a biochemical inducer to turn on the GFP gene.
420700	427860	Our materials for this process will include a bacteria seedstock, in this case E. coli,
427860	431900	that has been genetically enhanced to produce GFP.
431900	439260	The basic ingredients for a compatible media which include nutrients, stabilizers, an antibiotic,
439260	446500	and an anti-foaming agent, and IPTG, which is the biochemical inducer that switches on
446500	449180	the GFP gene.
449180	456780	The equipment that we'll be using includes a 300-liter bio-reactor, a UV-Viz spectrophotometer
456780	461540	to monitor the optical density, which is a measure of the concentration of cells in the
461540	470980	bio-reactor, a glucose analyzer to measure glucose, a key nutrient, an offline pH meter
470980	477180	to help track the acid-base balance, and adjust online measurements if needed, and a broth
477180	480340	tank for our final product.
480340	486780	The bio-reactor is equipped with a water jacket around the vessel to regulate temperature,
486780	493700	and integrated sensors to monitor key environmental factors, including dissolved oxygen, pH, internal
493700	499340	temperature, water jacket temperature, and vessel pressure.
499340	508300	The reactor also has an agitator, dedicated ports for adding seedstock and media ingredients,
508300	516380	separate ports for acid and base supplement, air filters for supply and exhaust, and valves
516380	520900	for drawing samples and for harvesting.
520900	525940	Most fermentation and monitoring functions can be managed from the bio-reactor's dedicated
525940	528660	process controller.
528660	534340	Before the fermentation process can begin, the area must be prepared.
534340	539900	Preparation includes removing equipment and material that won't be used in the process,
539900	545940	cleaning and sanitizing the area and equipment, and sterilizing equipment as required by the
545940	550980	SOPs, Standard Operating Procedures.
550980	555700	Sterilization is used to eliminate unwanted microorganisms which can grow naturally in
555700	559260	the fermentation media and process equipment.
559260	567260	Also, all required materials and documentation should be gathered and prepared, and all process
567260	572500	control software should be loaded and verified.
572500	578820	The fermentation batch process will be guided and documented with the BPR, Batch Process
578820	580580	Record.
580580	587460	The batch record leads the operator through the process step by step, with each step requiring
587460	592860	a sign-off and separate verification.
592860	605500	This record also includes spaces for documenting key times, activities and instrument readings.
605500	613460	The GFP fermentation process really begins with the expansion of our bacteria seedstock.
613460	618900	After removing the specially modified E. coli from the freezer and thawing it, it's
618900	625060	used to inoculate a small amount of fresh media in a shaker flask.
625060	629500	After the number of cells has reached the target amount, the thriving cells are ready
629500	631460	for fermentation.
631460	637820	Meanwhile, in the fermentation area, operators begin with a complete check of all critical
637820	639140	equipment.
639140	648460	Valves, caps and lines are checked, hoses are tightened, probes are verified and calibrated,
648460	654660	and 10 kg of HPW, high purity water, is added to the vessel.
654660	659780	The bioreactor is brought up to normal process pressure and held there in order to check
659780	661700	for leaks.
661700	665980	The pressure is monitored over a 30-minute period.
665980	672060	If a leak is detected, the problem is corrected and the test is run again.
672060	678860	Once the reactor passes the test, we are ready to mix the media in the vessel.
678860	687220	The agitator is turned on and the ingredients are added.
687220	697860	Yeast extract, tryptic soy broth, ammonium chloride, sodium bifosphate, monopotassium
697860	703020	phosphate, and an anti-foam compound.
703020	710820	Once all the initial ingredients are in, another 10 kg of high purity water is added.
710820	718340	All ports and valves are closed, all condensate valves are opened, and the bioreactor begins
718340	723500	an SIP, sterilized in place cycle.
723500	730340	The target for sterilization is 121 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.
730340	736060	As soon as the temperature climbs to the targeted temperature, the condensate valves are closed,
736060	740180	and the SIP cycle completes automatically.
740180	746020	Both the vessel and the media are now sterile, and we're ready to add the final ingredients
746020	748060	to our media.
748060	754820	The glucose hose is attached to the vessel, the connection is steamed to sterilize it,
754820	761860	and the separately sterilized glucose antibiotic solution is pumped into the vessel.
761860	768300	Then a manual pH reading of the media is taken.
768300	773620	And the bioreactor is set up for its fermentation cycle.
773620	781220	After the inoculation hose is connected to the reactor and steamed for 20 minutes, the
781220	787900	expanded seedstock is pumped into the reactor containing the media.
787900	789540	Fermentation now begins.
789540	796620	The operator takes zero hour readings and begins to regularly monitor batch temperature, agitator
796620	805180	RPMs, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, vessel pressure, optical density, airflow rate, and
805180	808500	glucose concentrations.
808500	813540	Optical densities and glucose concentrations are of particular interest, so they're graphed
813540	816700	as well as documented.
816700	823740	When the targeted levels of glucose and optical density are achieved, it's time to add IPTG
823740	831300	to the vessel to activate or turn on the expression of the green fluorescent protein in the cells.
831300	836420	After allowing enough time for the cells to produce green fluorescent protein, usually
836420	840620	five hours more, final readings are taken.
840620	847300	And a sample is drawn to check the percentage of cell solids.
847300	850660	The product is now referred to as broth.
850660	856940	The broth, which contains spent media and cells, is complete when the key nutrient, glucose,
856940	862860	is mostly consumed and the batch has reached the desired concentration.
862860	869500	The batch is then cooled down, pumped into a broth tank, and labeled with the batch number,
869500	872580	volume, time, and date.
872580	876620	The fermentation process is now complete.
876620	882060	The harvested broth will now move downstream to the recovery process, where the cells will
882060	887700	be ruptured to free the green fluorescent protein, and the protein will be separated
887700	889460	from the other broth components.
