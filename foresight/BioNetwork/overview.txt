Processing Overview for BioNetwork

1. **Preparation**: Before starting the fermentation process, ensure all equipment is sterilized according to SOPs. Prepare all materials and documentation needed for the batch process. Load and verify all process control software.

2. **Inoculation**: Thaw the seedstock of genetically modified E. coli from the freezer and inoculate it into a smaller shaker flask with fresh media to expand the cells to the desired concentration.

3. **Equipment Check**: In the fermentation area, perform a comprehensive check of all critical equipment, including valves, caps, lines, probes, and hoses. Add high purity water to the bioreactor and perform a leak test by pressurizing the vessel.

4. **Media Mixing**: Once the reactor passes the leak test, add the initial media ingredients, including yeast extract, tryptic soy broth, ammonium chloride, sodium bifosphate, monopotassium phosphate, and anti-foam. Add another 10 kg of high purity water, close all ports and valves, open condensate valves, and initiate the SIP cycle at 121°C for 30 minutes to sterilize the vessel and media.

5. **Adding Final Ingredients**: After completing the SIP cycle, add the glucose antibiotic solution through a steamed hose into the reactor. Take a manual pH reading and set up the fermentation parameters.

6. **Inoculation**: Sterilize the inoculation hose for 20 minutes, then introduce the expanded seedstock into the reactor containing the sterile media.

7. **Fermentation**: Begin monitoring key parameters such as temperature, agitator RPMs, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, vessel pressure, optical density, airflow rate, and glucose concentrations. Plot these values on graphs for record-keeping.

8. **Adding IPTG**: Once the desired levels of glucose and optical density are achieved, add isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce the expression of green fluorescent protein in the cells.

9. **Final Readings and Harvesting**: After a set period for protein production, take final readings and draw a sample to measure cell solids concentration. Once glucose is mostly consumed, the batch is complete. Cool the broth, pump it into a broth tank, and label it with all necessary information.

10. **Downstream Processing**: The harvested broth will move on to the recovery process where cells are ruptured to release the green fluorescent protein, followed by separation from other components in the broth using appropriate downstream processing techniques.

Throughout this entire process, meticulous documentation and adherence to SOPs are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the product and ensuring safety and compliance with regulations.
