00:00.000 --> 00:23.600
We all know something about fermentation.

00:23.600 --> 00:29.440
It's a process used countless times each day to make a variety of dairy products, baked

00:29.440 --> 00:31.520
goods, and beverages.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.960
We sometimes think of it as letting foods go bad, but in a controlled way.

00:36.960 --> 00:45.160
With a little help, milk becomes yogurt, bread rises, and grains decompose, creating

00:45.160 --> 00:48.920
alcoholic beverages and alternative fuels.

00:48.920 --> 00:54.160
But looking at these examples only gives us a clue as to what's really happening, and

00:54.160 --> 01:00.480
how we can use the power of fermentation to cost-effectively create a broad array of biological

01:00.480 --> 01:02.800
products.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.120
So what is fermentation?

01:06.120 --> 01:09.880
A cell can be thought of as a micro-factory.

01:09.880 --> 01:17.000
These cells can be bacteria, fungi, or specific cells from mammals, plants, or insects.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.520
In biotechnology, these cells are used to manufacture a product in a process called fermentation.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.480
For yogurt, buttermilk, and cheese, we use bacteria.

01:30.480 --> 01:36.200
To make breads and alcoholic beverages, we use yeast, a fungus.

01:36.200 --> 01:41.440
And the production of some vaccines require the growth of mammalian cells that are infected

01:41.440 --> 01:44.080
with a specific virus.

01:44.080 --> 01:50.160
The product the cells manufacture is usually a chemical the cells contain naturally, or

01:50.160 --> 01:56.440
a substance that the cells have been genetically altered to create, or even a metabolic waste

01:56.440 --> 02:02.040
product of the organism's growth, like one of our examples, alcohol.

02:02.040 --> 02:07.800
There are too many everyday products created by commercial-scale fermentation to even list,

02:07.800 --> 02:16.480
but some common ones include amino acids, biopharmaceuticals, dyes, enzymes, food products,

02:16.480 --> 02:26.400
lipids, steroids, and vitamins.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.480
Fermentation is a reasonably simple process.

02:29.480 --> 02:34.960
A cell is selected based on its ability to produce the desired product.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.720
A seedstock of cells is put into a small amount of media.

02:39.720 --> 02:45.200
Media provides the nutritional products the cell needs to grow.

02:45.200 --> 02:50.400
When the population of cells has grown and consumed most of the nutrients, it's moved

02:50.400 --> 02:57.040
into a larger vessel with more growth media, and the process repeats.

02:57.040 --> 03:02.760
This scaling up is complete when the quantity of cells is large and healthy enough to transfer

03:02.760 --> 03:09.180
into a production vessel, often referred to as a bioreactor or fermenter.

03:09.180 --> 03:14.440
With plenty of fresh media now available and under tightly controlled conditions, the cells

03:14.440 --> 03:17.400
grow and manufacture product.

03:17.400 --> 03:23.000
When the fermentation is complete, the product is harvested.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.080
Fermentation is known as an upstream biotechnology process.

03:27.080 --> 03:33.960
It occurs early in the production flow before recovery, purification, formulation, filling,

03:33.960 --> 03:36.520
and packaging.

03:36.520 --> 03:41.680
To better understand the fermentation process, we should first find out a little bit about

03:41.680 --> 03:48.080
the cells we use and what they may require to reproduce and stay healthy.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.660
Different cells have different needs.

03:50.660 --> 03:57.380
Some are aerobic, they need oxygen, while others are anaerobic and do not require oxygen.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.660
All cells require nutrition.

03:59.660 --> 04:07.060
A properly formulated media contains the necessary nutrients to allow cells to grow and produce.

04:07.060 --> 04:12.280
The fermenter mixes the cells evenly throughout the media to suspend the cells and supply

04:12.280 --> 04:15.980
the oxygen necessary for growth.

04:15.980 --> 04:21.100
Health and efficient fermentation requires rigorous monitoring and control of the environment

04:21.100 --> 04:24.340
within the bioreactor.

04:24.340 --> 04:30.740
Key factors include temperature, pressure, pH, which is a measure of how acidic or alkaline

04:30.740 --> 04:37.740
the media is, oxygen, usually measured as dissolved oxygen within the media, and nutrient

04:37.740 --> 04:39.340
levels.

04:39.340 --> 04:44.060
Although the environment and the media are tailored to the needs of specific cells, the

04:44.060 --> 04:49.820
life cycle of almost all batches follows a predictable pattern.

04:49.820 --> 04:59.540
The growth pattern has four phases, lag, exponential, or log, stationary, and death.

04:59.540 --> 05:05.700
When a cell is first introduced to fresh media, it has to adapt to its new environment.

05:05.700 --> 05:10.220
This creates a lull or lag in the growth timeline.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.140
After the organism adapts, the batch takes off.

05:14.140 --> 05:21.140
The cells begin dividing at a constant rate, an exponential, or logarithmic, or log increase,

05:21.140 --> 05:26.420
doubling, then doubling again, and on and on.

05:26.420 --> 05:32.660
As the nutrients in the media are consumed, toxic metabolic waste products build up, cells

05:32.660 --> 05:36.580
begin to die, and growth slows.

05:36.580 --> 05:41.700
When it reaches a point that just as many cells are dying as are dividing, the batch

05:41.700 --> 05:45.700
enters the stationary phase.

05:45.700 --> 05:50.900
This is the point at which the key nutrients are completely consumed, the fermentation

05:50.900 --> 05:55.100
is stopped, and the fermented broth is harvested.

05:55.100 --> 06:00.660
If the fermentation were allowed to continue, the cells would enter the death phase.

06:00.660 --> 06:07.380
Our cells die than divide, and, similar to the exponential phase, the death rate increases

06:07.380 --> 06:10.380
logarithmically.

06:15.860 --> 06:21.900
Now that we have a basic understanding of how fermentation works, let's look at an actual

06:21.900 --> 06:25.740
process and see how it all comes together.

06:25.740 --> 06:31.580
For our sample process, we will look at the production of green fluorescent protein, or

06:31.580 --> 06:32.580
GFP.

06:32.580 --> 06:36.820
GFP is broadly used as a biological marker.

06:36.820 --> 06:42.140
It's a fluorescent dye that's very well tolerated by most cells, and doesn't interfere

06:42.140 --> 06:45.340
with normal cellular function.

06:45.340 --> 06:51.340
In the GFP fermentation process, we'll need to add an antibiotic to protect the purity

06:51.340 --> 07:00.700
of the batch, and then, late in the process, a biochemical inducer to turn on the GFP gene.

07:00.700 --> 07:07.860
Our materials for this process will include a bacteria seedstock, in this case E. coli,

07:07.860 --> 07:11.900
that has been genetically enhanced to produce GFP.

07:11.900 --> 07:19.260
The basic ingredients for a compatible media which include nutrients, stabilizers, an antibiotic,

07:19.260 --> 07:26.500
and an anti-foaming agent, and IPTG, which is the biochemical inducer that switches on

07:26.500 --> 07:29.180
the GFP gene.

07:29.180 --> 07:36.780
The equipment that we'll be using includes a 300-liter bio-reactor, a UV-Viz spectrophotometer

07:36.780 --> 07:41.540
to monitor the optical density, which is a measure of the concentration of cells in the

07:41.540 --> 07:50.980
bio-reactor, a glucose analyzer to measure glucose, a key nutrient, an offline pH meter

07:50.980 --> 07:57.180
to help track the acid-base balance, and adjust online measurements if needed, and a broth

07:57.180 --> 08:00.340
tank for our final product.

08:00.340 --> 08:06.780
The bio-reactor is equipped with a water jacket around the vessel to regulate temperature,

08:06.780 --> 08:13.700
and integrated sensors to monitor key environmental factors, including dissolved oxygen, pH, internal

08:13.700 --> 08:19.340
temperature, water jacket temperature, and vessel pressure.

08:19.340 --> 08:28.300
The reactor also has an agitator, dedicated ports for adding seedstock and media ingredients,

08:28.300 --> 08:36.380
separate ports for acid and base supplement, air filters for supply and exhaust, and valves

08:36.380 --> 08:40.900
for drawing samples and for harvesting.

08:40.900 --> 08:45.940
Most fermentation and monitoring functions can be managed from the bio-reactor's dedicated

08:45.940 --> 08:48.660
process controller.

08:48.660 --> 08:54.340
Before the fermentation process can begin, the area must be prepared.

08:54.340 --> 08:59.900
Preparation includes removing equipment and material that won't be used in the process,

08:59.900 --> 09:05.940
cleaning and sanitizing the area and equipment, and sterilizing equipment as required by the

09:05.940 --> 09:10.980
SOPs, Standard Operating Procedures.

09:10.980 --> 09:15.700
Sterilization is used to eliminate unwanted microorganisms which can grow naturally in

09:15.700 --> 09:19.260
the fermentation media and process equipment.

09:19.260 --> 09:27.260
Also, all required materials and documentation should be gathered and prepared, and all process

09:27.260 --> 09:32.500
control software should be loaded and verified.

09:32.500 --> 09:38.820
The fermentation batch process will be guided and documented with the BPR, Batch Process

09:38.820 --> 09:40.580
Record.

09:40.580 --> 09:47.460
The batch record leads the operator through the process step by step, with each step requiring

09:47.460 --> 09:52.860
a sign-off and separate verification.

09:52.860 --> 10:05.500
This record also includes spaces for documenting key times, activities and instrument readings.

10:05.500 --> 10:13.460
The GFP fermentation process really begins with the expansion of our bacteria seedstock.

10:13.460 --> 10:18.900
After removing the specially modified E. coli from the freezer and thawing it, it's

10:18.900 --> 10:25.060
used to inoculate a small amount of fresh media in a shaker flask.

10:25.060 --> 10:29.500
After the number of cells has reached the target amount, the thriving cells are ready

10:29.500 --> 10:31.460
for fermentation.

10:31.460 --> 10:37.820
Meanwhile, in the fermentation area, operators begin with a complete check of all critical

10:37.820 --> 10:39.140
equipment.

10:39.140 --> 10:48.460
Valves, caps and lines are checked, hoses are tightened, probes are verified and calibrated,

10:48.460 --> 10:54.660
and 10 kg of HPW, high purity water, is added to the vessel.

10:54.660 --> 10:59.780
The bioreactor is brought up to normal process pressure and held there in order to check

10:59.780 --> 11:01.700
for leaks.

11:01.700 --> 11:05.980
The pressure is monitored over a 30-minute period.

11:05.980 --> 11:12.060
If a leak is detected, the problem is corrected and the test is run again.

11:12.060 --> 11:18.860
Once the reactor passes the test, we are ready to mix the media in the vessel.

11:18.860 --> 11:27.220
The agitator is turned on and the ingredients are added.

11:27.220 --> 11:37.860
Yeast extract, tryptic soy broth, ammonium chloride, sodium bifosphate, monopotassium

11:37.860 --> 11:43.020
phosphate, and an anti-foam compound.

11:43.020 --> 11:50.820
Once all the initial ingredients are in, another 10 kg of high purity water is added.

11:50.820 --> 11:58.340
All ports and valves are closed, all condensate valves are opened, and the bioreactor begins

11:58.340 --> 12:03.500
an SIP, sterilized in place cycle.

12:03.500 --> 12:10.340
The target for sterilization is 121 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.

12:10.340 --> 12:16.060
As soon as the temperature climbs to the targeted temperature, the condensate valves are closed,

12:16.060 --> 12:20.180
and the SIP cycle completes automatically.

12:20.180 --> 12:26.020
Both the vessel and the media are now sterile, and we're ready to add the final ingredients

12:26.020 --> 12:28.060
to our media.

12:28.060 --> 12:34.820
The glucose hose is attached to the vessel, the connection is steamed to sterilize it,

12:34.820 --> 12:41.860
and the separately sterilized glucose antibiotic solution is pumped into the vessel.

12:41.860 --> 12:48.300
Then a manual pH reading of the media is taken.

12:48.300 --> 12:53.620
And the bioreactor is set up for its fermentation cycle.

12:53.620 --> 13:01.220
After the inoculation hose is connected to the reactor and steamed for 20 minutes, the

13:01.220 --> 13:07.900
expanded seedstock is pumped into the reactor containing the media.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.540
Fermentation now begins.

13:09.540 --> 13:16.620
The operator takes zero hour readings and begins to regularly monitor batch temperature, agitator

13:16.620 --> 13:25.180
RPMs, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, vessel pressure, optical density, airflow rate, and

13:25.180 --> 13:28.500
glucose concentrations.

13:28.500 --> 13:33.540
Optical densities and glucose concentrations are of particular interest, so they're graphed

13:33.540 --> 13:36.700
as well as documented.

13:36.700 --> 13:43.740
When the targeted levels of glucose and optical density are achieved, it's time to add IPTG

13:43.740 --> 13:51.300
to the vessel to activate or turn on the expression of the green fluorescent protein in the cells.

13:51.300 --> 13:56.420
After allowing enough time for the cells to produce green fluorescent protein, usually

13:56.420 --> 14:00.620
five hours more, final readings are taken.

14:00.620 --> 14:07.300
And a sample is drawn to check the percentage of cell solids.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.660
The product is now referred to as broth.

14:10.660 --> 14:16.940
The broth, which contains spent media and cells, is complete when the key nutrient, glucose,

14:16.940 --> 14:22.860
is mostly consumed and the batch has reached the desired concentration.

14:22.860 --> 14:29.500
The batch is then cooled down, pumped into a broth tank, and labeled with the batch number,

14:29.500 --> 14:32.580
volume, time, and date.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.620
The fermentation process is now complete.

14:36.620 --> 14:42.060
The harvested broth will now move downstream to the recovery process, where the cells will

14:42.060 --> 14:47.700
be ruptured to free the green fluorescent protein, and the protein will be separated

14:47.700 --> 14:49.460
from the other broth components.
