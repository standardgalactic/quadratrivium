1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,600
We all know something about fermentation.

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,440
It's a process used countless times each day to make a variety of dairy products, baked

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,520
goods, and beverages.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,960
We sometimes think of it as letting foods go bad, but in a controlled way.

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,160
With a little help, milk becomes yogurt, bread rises, and grains decompose, creating

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,920
alcoholic beverages and alternative fuels.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,160
But looking at these examples only gives us a clue as to what's really happening, and

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,480
how we can use the power of fermentation to cost-effectively create a broad array of biological

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
products.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,120
So what is fermentation?

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,880
A cell can be thought of as a micro-factory.

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,000
These cells can be bacteria, fungi, or specific cells from mammals, plants, or insects.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,520
In biotechnology, these cells are used to manufacture a product in a process called fermentation.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,480
For yogurt, buttermilk, and cheese, we use bacteria.

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,200
To make breads and alcoholic beverages, we use yeast, a fungus.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,440
And the production of some vaccines require the growth of mammalian cells that are infected

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,080
with a specific virus.

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,160
The product the cells manufacture is usually a chemical the cells contain naturally, or

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,440
a substance that the cells have been genetically altered to create, or even a metabolic waste

20
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:02,040
product of the organism's growth, like one of our examples, alcohol.

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,800
There are too many everyday products created by commercial-scale fermentation to even list,

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:16,480
but some common ones include amino acids, biopharmaceuticals, dyes, enzymes, food products,

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:26,400
lipids, steroids, and vitamins.

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,480
Fermentation is a reasonably simple process.

25
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,960
A cell is selected based on its ability to produce the desired product.

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,720
A seedstock of cells is put into a small amount of media.

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,200
Media provides the nutritional products the cell needs to grow.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,400
When the population of cells has grown and consumed most of the nutrients, it's moved

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,040
into a larger vessel with more growth media, and the process repeats.

30
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,760
This scaling up is complete when the quantity of cells is large and healthy enough to transfer

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,180
into a production vessel, often referred to as a bioreactor or fermenter.

32
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,440
With plenty of fresh media now available and under tightly controlled conditions, the cells

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,400
grow and manufacture product.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,000
When the fermentation is complete, the product is harvested.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,080
Fermentation is known as an upstream biotechnology process.

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,960
It occurs early in the production flow before recovery, purification, formulation, filling,

37
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,520
and packaging.

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,680
To better understand the fermentation process, we should first find out a little bit about

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,080
the cells we use and what they may require to reproduce and stay healthy.

40
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,660
Different cells have different needs.

41
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:57,380
Some are aerobic, they need oxygen, while others are anaerobic and do not require oxygen.

42
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,660
All cells require nutrition.

43
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:07,060
A properly formulated media contains the necessary nutrients to allow cells to grow and produce.

44
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,280
The fermenter mixes the cells evenly throughout the media to suspend the cells and supply

45
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,980
the oxygen necessary for growth.

46
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,100
Health and efficient fermentation requires rigorous monitoring and control of the environment

47
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,340
within the bioreactor.

48
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,740
Key factors include temperature, pressure, pH, which is a measure of how acidic or alkaline

49
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,740
the media is, oxygen, usually measured as dissolved oxygen within the media, and nutrient

50
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,340
levels.

51
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,060
Although the environment and the media are tailored to the needs of specific cells, the

52
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,820
life cycle of almost all batches follows a predictable pattern.

53
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:59,540
The growth pattern has four phases, lag, exponential, or log, stationary, and death.

54
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,700
When a cell is first introduced to fresh media, it has to adapt to its new environment.

55
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,220
This creates a lull or lag in the growth timeline.

56
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,140
After the organism adapts, the batch takes off.

57
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:21,140
The cells begin dividing at a constant rate, an exponential, or logarithmic, or log increase,

58
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,420
doubling, then doubling again, and on and on.

59
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,660
As the nutrients in the media are consumed, toxic metabolic waste products build up, cells

60
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,580
begin to die, and growth slows.

61
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,700
When it reaches a point that just as many cells are dying as are dividing, the batch

62
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,700
enters the stationary phase.

63
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,900
This is the point at which the key nutrients are completely consumed, the fermentation

64
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,100
is stopped, and the fermented broth is harvested.

65
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,660
If the fermentation were allowed to continue, the cells would enter the death phase.

66
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:07,380
Our cells die than divide, and, similar to the exponential phase, the death rate increases

67
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
logarithmically.

68
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,900
Now that we have a basic understanding of how fermentation works, let's look at an actual

69
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,740
process and see how it all comes together.

70
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,580
For our sample process, we will look at the production of green fluorescent protein, or

71
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
GFP.

72
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,820
GFP is broadly used as a biological marker.

73
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,140
It's a fluorescent dye that's very well tolerated by most cells, and doesn't interfere

74
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,340
with normal cellular function.

75
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:51,340
In the GFP fermentation process, we'll need to add an antibiotic to protect the purity

76
00:06:51,340 --> 00:07:00,700
of the batch, and then, late in the process, a biochemical inducer to turn on the GFP gene.

77
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:07,860
Our materials for this process will include a bacteria seedstock, in this case E. coli,

78
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,900
that has been genetically enhanced to produce GFP.

79
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:19,260
The basic ingredients for a compatible media which include nutrients, stabilizers, an antibiotic,

80
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:26,500
and an anti-foaming agent, and IPTG, which is the biochemical inducer that switches on

81
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,180
the GFP gene.

82
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,780
The equipment that we'll be using includes a 300-liter bio-reactor, a UV-Viz spectrophotometer

83
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,540
to monitor the optical density, which is a measure of the concentration of cells in the

84
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:50,980
bio-reactor, a glucose analyzer to measure glucose, a key nutrient, an offline pH meter

85
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,180
to help track the acid-base balance, and adjust online measurements if needed, and a broth

86
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,340
tank for our final product.

87
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,780
The bio-reactor is equipped with a water jacket around the vessel to regulate temperature,

88
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,700
and integrated sensors to monitor key environmental factors, including dissolved oxygen, pH, internal

89
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,340
temperature, water jacket temperature, and vessel pressure.

90
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:28,300
The reactor also has an agitator, dedicated ports for adding seedstock and media ingredients,

91
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:36,380
separate ports for acid and base supplement, air filters for supply and exhaust, and valves

92
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,900
for drawing samples and for harvesting.

93
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,940
Most fermentation and monitoring functions can be managed from the bio-reactor's dedicated

94
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,660
process controller.

95
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,340
Before the fermentation process can begin, the area must be prepared.

96
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,900
Preparation includes removing equipment and material that won't be used in the process,

97
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,940
cleaning and sanitizing the area and equipment, and sterilizing equipment as required by the

98
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,980
SOPs, Standard Operating Procedures.

99
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,700
Sterilization is used to eliminate unwanted microorganisms which can grow naturally in

100
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,260
the fermentation media and process equipment.

101
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:27,260
Also, all required materials and documentation should be gathered and prepared, and all process

102
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,500
control software should be loaded and verified.

103
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,820
The fermentation batch process will be guided and documented with the BPR, Batch Process

104
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,580
Record.

105
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:47,460
The batch record leads the operator through the process step by step, with each step requiring

106
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,860
a sign-off and separate verification.

107
00:09:52,860 --> 00:10:05,500
This record also includes spaces for documenting key times, activities and instrument readings.

108
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,460
The GFP fermentation process really begins with the expansion of our bacteria seedstock.

109
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,900
After removing the specially modified E. coli from the freezer and thawing it, it's

110
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:25,060
used to inoculate a small amount of fresh media in a shaker flask.

111
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,500
After the number of cells has reached the target amount, the thriving cells are ready

112
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,460
for fermentation.

113
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:37,820
Meanwhile, in the fermentation area, operators begin with a complete check of all critical

114
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,140
equipment.

115
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:48,460
Valves, caps and lines are checked, hoses are tightened, probes are verified and calibrated,

116
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,660
and 10 kg of HPW, high purity water, is added to the vessel.

117
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,780
The bioreactor is brought up to normal process pressure and held there in order to check

118
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,700
for leaks.

119
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,980
The pressure is monitored over a 30-minute period.

120
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,060
If a leak is detected, the problem is corrected and the test is run again.

121
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,860
Once the reactor passes the test, we are ready to mix the media in the vessel.

122
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:27,220
The agitator is turned on and the ingredients are added.

123
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:37,860
Yeast extract, tryptic soy broth, ammonium chloride, sodium bifosphate, monopotassium

124
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,020
phosphate, and an anti-foam compound.

125
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:50,820
Once all the initial ingredients are in, another 10 kg of high purity water is added.

126
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:58,340
All ports and valves are closed, all condensate valves are opened, and the bioreactor begins

127
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,500
an SIP, sterilized in place cycle.

128
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,340
The target for sterilization is 121 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.

129
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:16,060
As soon as the temperature climbs to the targeted temperature, the condensate valves are closed,

130
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,180
and the SIP cycle completes automatically.

131
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:26,020
Both the vessel and the media are now sterile, and we're ready to add the final ingredients

132
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,060
to our media.

133
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,820
The glucose hose is attached to the vessel, the connection is steamed to sterilize it,

134
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:41,860
and the separately sterilized glucose antibiotic solution is pumped into the vessel.

135
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,300
Then a manual pH reading of the media is taken.

136
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,620
And the bioreactor is set up for its fermentation cycle.

137
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:01,220
After the inoculation hose is connected to the reactor and steamed for 20 minutes, the

138
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,900
expanded seedstock is pumped into the reactor containing the media.

139
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,540
Fermentation now begins.

140
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,620
The operator takes zero hour readings and begins to regularly monitor batch temperature, agitator

141
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:25,180
RPMs, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, vessel pressure, optical density, airflow rate, and

142
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,500
glucose concentrations.

143
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,540
Optical densities and glucose concentrations are of particular interest, so they're graphed

144
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,700
as well as documented.

145
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:43,740
When the targeted levels of glucose and optical density are achieved, it's time to add IPTG

146
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:51,300
to the vessel to activate or turn on the expression of the green fluorescent protein in the cells.

147
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,420
After allowing enough time for the cells to produce green fluorescent protein, usually

148
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,620
five hours more, final readings are taken.

149
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:07,300
And a sample is drawn to check the percentage of cell solids.

150
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,660
The product is now referred to as broth.

151
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,940
The broth, which contains spent media and cells, is complete when the key nutrient, glucose,

152
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,860
is mostly consumed and the batch has reached the desired concentration.

153
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,500
The batch is then cooled down, pumped into a broth tank, and labeled with the batch number,

154
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,580
volume, time, and date.

155
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,620
The fermentation process is now complete.

156
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,060
The harvested broth will now move downstream to the recovery process, where the cells will

157
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,700
be ruptured to free the green fluorescent protein, and the protein will be separated

158
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,460
from the other broth components.
