0	7040	Quote, whether primitive or not, mankind always stands in the brink of actions it performs
7040	10080	itself but does not control.
10080	17040	The whole world wants peace, and the whole world prepares for war, to take but one example.
17040	23100	Mankind is powerless against mankind, and the gods as ever show it in the ways of fate.
23100	28400	Today we call the gods factors, which comes from facere to make.
28400	32040	The makers stand behind the wings of the world theater.
32040	35480	It is so in great things as in small.
35480	41320	In the realm of consciousness we are our own masters, we seem to be the factors themselves,
41320	45920	but if we step through the door of the shadow, we discover with terror that we are the objects
45920	48320	of unseen factors.
48320	54000	To know this is decidedly unpleasant, for nothing is more disillusioning than the discovery
54000	56720	of our own inadequacy.
56720	61480	Mankind can even give rise to primitive panic, because instead of being believed in, the
61480	66320	anxiously guarded supremacy of consciousness, which is, in truth, one of the secrets of
66320	71080	human success, is questioned in the most dangerous way.
71080	73080	End quote.
73080	77920	That's from Carl Jung's essay, Arc Types of the Collective Unconscious, and in that
77920	83600	passage Jung puts forward the central idea of his philosophy of the psyche, his most
83600	86520	important and also his most terrifying.
86520	93360	Here he raises the prospect of mankind as a creature who is not the maker of his own
93360	96840	fate, a creature who is in the hands of the gods.
96840	102200	In modern times we've renamed these divinities, we've made them accord with a mechanistic
102200	107720	scientific understanding of the world, and we've presumed that on this basis we can dispense
107720	114360	with these gods, we can regard the ego-consciousness as its own self-governing autonomous entity.
114360	120840	Carl Jung's project is, in some sense, as simple as the project of restoring our awareness
120840	127380	of these unseen factors, driving our thought and action, and restoring a sense of respect
127380	133280	and awe for them, the project to restore a healthy respect for the gods, which we now
133280	136280	call unconscious factors.
136280	141240	And in doing this Jung seeks to revive the religious or mythic language by which we
141240	146120	used to speak about these things, which he believes still dwell deep within the human
146120	153320	psyche, not as part of our consciousness, not as subjects within the power of the consciousness,
153320	157680	but as the master behind the throne of consciousness.
157680	163200	As straightforward as this may seem, however, such a prospect remains a daunting challenge
163200	169160	for the modern man, because we have not found gods and goddesses in our search of the stars
169160	171320	and of galaxies.
171320	175240	We have not found that the atoms are moved by mystical forces.
175240	181360	We've come to regard past mythologies as so many childish fables, which may serve as
181360	186280	a source of historical fascination, but which elucidates nothing about the objective world,
186280	189160	or the human condition as such.
189160	194880	The various mystical pursuits of man, whether it was the practice of astrology in which we
194880	199800	attempted to discover our future through the interpretation of the movement of celestial
199800	206400	bodies, or the great work of the alchemists, those proto-scientists who believed that the
206400	210920	laws which govern the divine are the same as the laws that govern the material world,
210920	215600	or the many religious stories and prophecies recorded in our holy books that endeavor to
215600	220520	tell us the origin and meaning of life through divine revelation.
220520	224560	The modern mind looks at all of this and sees nothing but a series of outdated and
224560	227080	unscientific assertions.
227080	233560	These were merely culturally and geographically bound folktales in the modern view.
233560	238280	They reveal nothing about the real meaning of human life, that is, if we even permit
238280	244200	that life may have a meaning, which in itself is regarded as a disagreeable presumption.
244200	250960	We might say that we see all of these artifacts of religious thought as childish things coming
250960	258120	from the youth and ignorance of youth of our race, and to put it in the language of the
258120	265280	Bible, the scientific modern mind says it is high past time to put away childish things.
265280	273280	And yet, throughout Jung's work in psychoanalysis, he steadily began to believe that these mythical
273280	279540	figures and stories are far more than the mere playthings of a more childish mankind
279540	284760	that could simply be put to the side upon the scientific maturity of the human race.
284760	291880	The reason for Jung's suspicion is based on the observation that his patients would recreate
291880	297480	the imagery of myth and religion, in their dreams, or in the case of schizophrenics,
297480	298960	in their hallucinations.
299600	305120	Furthermore, when Jung had his patients draw or paint freely as a form of therapeutic exercise,
305120	307280	he found they would do peculiar things.
307280	312600	They would draw mandalas, for example, a type of circular sigil common to the imagery of
312600	318400	Eastern spirituality, but completely unknown Jung tells us among his European patients
318400	319840	at that time.
319840	325120	They would draw upon the same kinds of allegories used by esoteric Christians such as the Russa
325120	329600	Crucian Order, but without having any knowledge that they were doing so.
329600	335360	And Jung began to suspect that there was a language, a lexicon, being employed here,
335360	342440	a language of images and symbols that seemed to derive from a deeper well than the mere
342440	347080	personal experience of his patients or their cultural upbringing, that his patients were
347080	352880	drawing upon something deep within the psyche that was not individual, but universal.
352880	358920	The collective psychic contents of all mankind, which we use when we attempt to discuss the
358920	365040	most significant aspects and events of our lives, the most transformative experiences
365040	369000	of life, draws upon this language.
369000	373000	Given the material that we've already covered this season, one can see the mark of Nietzsche's
373000	379080	thought on Jung's already from this description, as well as the ways in which Jung develops
379080	383120	the thought of his erstwhile friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud.
383120	388400	Unlike Freud, Jung was never interested in hiding his influences or claiming originality
388400	390080	for himself or his ideas.
390080	394680	I mean, in some sense Jung's whole project is oriented around the idea that he is not
394680	400920	an original thinker, that he's simply returning us to the knowledge that we have already held
400920	402600	since time immemorial.
402600	407240	But we've forgotten this with the death of our mythic language, our mythic understanding
407240	410680	or perspective that allowed us to talk about it.
410680	416240	Jung also credits previous thinkers such as Carus and von Hartmann as those who had brought
416240	419240	to light the power of the unconscious.
419240	424880	But where Jung goes beyond all these previous figures is insofar as he presents us with
424880	432760	a comprehensible system for approaching and understanding this vast and confusing realm
432760	435200	of the unconscious contents.
435200	440800	It is through psychology that we can once again approach the mythic and reintegrate these
440800	449080	two seemingly incongruous elements of our rational, moral, and outward persona with
449080	457600	the mysterious, powerful, numinous archetypes which are the secret makers of our destiny.
457600	463840	Karl Gustav Jung was born in 1875 in Switzerland.
463840	467360	Broadly speaking, his life bears some similarities to Nietzsche's.
467360	472080	As a young man, he initially thought of attending seminary and becoming a minister.
472080	477000	And then as a teenager, he began to study philosophy and this changed his plans for
477000	478000	life.
478000	480920	He opted to pursue the sciences instead.
480920	485640	While in Nietzsche's case, the path leads the young Friedrich Nietzsche to the discipline
485640	489880	of philology, Karl Jung pursued psychiatry.
489880	493840	He attended the University of Basel where he studied medicine.
493840	497400	By the early 1900s, he was in correspondence with Sigmund Freud.
497400	501360	The two men leave us a considerable volume of letters.
501360	506640	Freud was much older than Jung and over the period of six years during which they collaborated
506640	513280	extensively, Freud famously wanted Jung to become his successor in some sense.
513280	517160	He was trying to push Jung in that direction.
517160	523600	He wanted him to become the lifetime president of the International Psychoanalytical Association.
523600	526080	And Freud was overruled in this.
526080	530480	Jung instead served as president for two years instead of a lifetime appointment.
530480	537480	But he referred to Jung as his adoptive son, his sort of crown prince and successor.
537480	541880	As is commonly known, however, there was always a rift between the two men that would only
541880	544080	grow as the years went by.
544080	549600	Jung was dissatisfied with Freud's focus on sexuality as the primary driver of human
549600	550600	psychology.
550600	558160	Furthermore, he respected Freud's work as regards repression and his work on the id as
558160	563280	a repository for all that which the consciousness has attempted to suppress.
563280	567960	But Jung began to suspect that there was something far faster than a mere personal unconsciousness
567960	571040	beneath the surface world of the ego.
571040	576000	With the publication of Jung's lectures on the psychology of the unconscious in 1913,
576000	581600	a book which you can now find under the title of symbols of transformation, the disagreement
581600	585480	between the two men would only increase in its intensity.
585480	589560	And as a matter of fact, Jung said that this book's publication was the thing that ended
589560	591000	their friendship.
591000	595720	As Jung in that text made it clear just how seriously he differed with Freud's account
595720	596720	of the psyche.
596720	601960	Freud, it seems, had only wanted a crown prince and successor so long as they agreed
601960	608240	with him and carried on Freud's own project on Freud's own terms.
608240	614160	Furthermore, Freud is an atheist, and he's enrolled in a completely different kind of
614160	619920	task in the field of psychology than Jung is, whereas Freud's psychoanalysis sought to
619920	625520	explain the human being within a godless world, a world in which man's higher aspirations
625520	629040	could be seen as outgrowths of base urges.
629040	633280	All of man's moral sentiments could be born on the power of the libido.
633280	636560	Jung's tendency is almost the exact opposite.
636560	642240	In the depths of the unconsciousness, Jung does not see mere animal impulses or something
642240	645860	reducible to the basis drives of man.
645860	652040	He sees a well where we can reach down deep in it into truths so profound and inexpressible
652040	657800	by the consciousness that they can only be understood in religious terms.
657800	663520	Whereas Freud found in psychology the refutation of religious thinking as a curative to the
663520	669760	pathological complexes of the modern man, Jung found the affirmation of the value of
669760	674400	such thinking to be the very cure that the modern man was seeking.
674400	680360	The break with Freud had professional consequences for Jung, while Freud has been left behind
680480	682720	in the psychology of our time.
682720	688920	In the early decades of the 20th century Freud was the preeminent figure of the psychoanalysts.
688920	692560	He was essentially its founder and its greatest celebrity.
692560	697280	Jung more or less has a midlife crisis at this point.
697280	702960	He had what can only be described as an extended psychological episode that we could characterize
702960	707240	as either hysteria or depression or perhaps both.
707240	712960	At many times he was borderline suicidal, and during this time in which Jung spent
712960	719680	extended periods in solitude, he authored his Red Book, a series of diaries with fantastical
719680	725600	religious imagery which Jung saw as his way of working through what he perceived as a
725600	733080	dark night of the soul, which is a perennial theme in one's path of mystical or spiritual
733080	735520	transformation.
735560	740240	Jung however made it through this trying period, and he began publishing his work again in
740240	742400	various academic journals.
742400	747480	He served as an army doctor during World War I. In the interwar years he embarked on some
747480	754520	of his most famous and influential projects, including his book Psychological Types.
754520	759080	And during World War II a fun tidbit about his life that was not known until recently,
759080	763840	because if I recall correctly it was classified, but Jung wrote reports that he sent to the
763840	769160	U.S.S. the American Intelligence Branch that would later become the CIA, advising the Americans
769160	771720	on Hitler's mental state.
771720	778360	He traveled the world visiting America, Britain, Africa, India, equating himself with the mythic
778360	781440	underpinnings of the various world religions.
781440	786680	He was productive until his final year, until he passed away at the age of 85 in the year
786680	789680	1961.
789680	794120	The origins of Jung's theory of archetype states all the way back to his first major
794120	800120	publication on the psychology and pathology of so-called occult phenomena published in
800120	801920	1902.
801920	806200	This was the work that had drawn Freud's attention at the time.
806200	811760	In this work Jung described the hallucinatory fantasies of a hysterical spiritual medium
811760	816200	whose seances Jung attended in the late 1890s.
816200	820640	Should be noted, there was something of a craze surrounding seances and mediums during
820640	824240	the late 1800s and the first decades of the 1900s.
824240	829560	So this wasn't a terribly unusual social outing.
829560	835480	Jung notes how the patient, the spirit medium, would have these somnambulic attacks.
835480	840840	She would lose control of her motor function, be confronted by visions of spirits.
841280	846720	However, the patient's ego, her sense of her individual conscious persona, was present
846720	849600	and intact during these incidents.
849600	853040	That is, she did not display multiple personalities herself.
853040	860080	She seemed to remain the conscious subject, merely encountering these avatars of her unconscious
860080	861080	mind.
861080	867120	You see the first intimation of archetypes in this work, and that Jung comes to understand
867120	873240	that even though the spirits that the patient encounters are numerous, they could be grouped,
873240	876360	so to speak, into two definite types.
876360	880440	That in some sense all the different iterations of these spirit personalities were in fact
880440	887680	reiterations of the same two unconscious sub-personalities or complexes.
887680	890200	Jung writes in this article, quote,
890840	895800	It seems that many secondary series of ideas must have split off quite early from the primary
895800	897960	unconscious personality.
897960	902880	For already after the first two seances, spirits appeared by the dozen.
902880	907560	The names were inexhaustible in variety, but the differences between the personalities
907560	911960	were soon exhausted and it became apparent that they could all be subsumed under two
911960	917240	types, the serial religious type and the gay hilarious.
917280	921240	So far it was really only a matter of two different unconscious personalities, which
921240	926120	appeared under different names, but had no essential differences, end quote.
926120	930640	This insight is the germ of much of Jung's later thought.
930640	934880	It's a theme he would see play out time and again with multiple patients.
934880	941000	The same cast of characters, more or less, innumerable in terms of the exact name or
941000	946600	the image attributed to the character by the patient, but nevertheless the same in essence
946680	951040	as other iterations of the same character type.
951040	956560	Jung's research in the various world religions was spurred on by this same underlying idea.
956560	963600	He began to perceive that types appear in the myth-making of the various world cultures.
963600	964600	Jung writes, quote,
964840	970200	Permit of man impresses us so strongly with his subjectivity that we should really have
970200	975800	guessed long ago that myths refer to something psychic, end quote.
975800	981160	But unlike Freud, Jung did not seek to make our myths small and insignificant on that
981160	982160	basis.
982160	988520	Instead, he grows to see the depths of human psychology as being just as profound as our
988520	994120	oldest stories, and in fact it's the well from which these stories are drawn.
994120	998480	Now, as our main focus for this episode, we're going to turn to Volume 9 of Jung's
998480	1004040	collected works, which includes his essays written from the time of 1933 onward on the
1004040	1008000	subject of the archetypes and the collective unconscious.
1008000	1012720	From the very beginning of that volume, in the first essay included there entitled archetypes
1012720	1017560	of the collective unconscious, Jung makes clear the operative difference between his
1017560	1022320	own thought and that of Freud, quote.
1022320	1027400	At first, the concept of the unconscious was limited to denoting the state of repressed
1027400	1029440	or forgotten contents.
1029440	1034120	Even with Freud, who makes the unconscious, at least metaphorically, take the stage as
1034120	1038960	acting subject, it is really nothing but the gathering place of forgotten and repressed
1038960	1043720	contents, and has a functional significance thanks only to these.
1043720	1048480	For Freud, accordingly, the unconscious is of an exclusively personal nature, although
1048480	1052520	he was aware of its archaic and mythological thought forms.
1052520	1057320	A more or less superficial layer of the unconscious is undoubtedly personal.
1057320	1059760	I call it the personal unconscious.
1059760	1065160	But this personal unconscious rests upon a deeper layer, which does not derive from personal
1065160	1070600	experience and is not a personal acquisition, but is inborn.
1070600	1073760	This deeper layer I call the collective unconscious.
1073760	1078520	I have chosen the name collective because this part of the unconscious is not individual
1078520	1080080	but universal.
1080080	1085000	In contrast to the personal psyche, it has contents and modes of behavior that are more
1085000	1089240	or less the same everywhere and in all individuals.
1089240	1094560	It is, in other words, identical in all men and thus constitutes the common psychic substrate
1094560	1100760	of a super personal nature which is present in every one of us, end quote.
1100760	1107240	The collective unconscious is often wrongly characterized as a sort of supernatural claim
1107240	1112720	about humanity, as if we have some sort of psychic link between our minds or sort of
1112720	1116160	hive mind unconsciousness, something of the like.
1116160	1123000	The actual claim is simply that, in the same way that we're all born with certain instincts,
1123000	1128520	we're also all born with certain unconscious knowledge, that we have a pre-rational lexicon
1128520	1132560	of imagery or symbolism that exists in all human minds.
1132560	1139400	It's a starting, basic kit of information that's contained in the unconscious prior
1139400	1142680	to any enculturation or upbringing.
1142680	1147280	It's really no stronger of a claim than any claim about inborn traits or knowledge that
1147280	1151680	exists in every human being, which I think would be fairly hard to argue against.
1151680	1157400	To say that there is no universal, relatable palette of human emotions or impulses would
1157400	1159600	simply be patently false.
1159600	1164560	All human beings experience anger, experience sexual urges, experience hunger and thirst,
1164560	1169520	all human beings have a fight or flight mechanism, we can easily accept such ideas.
1169520	1174760	The troubling assertion that Jung makes, really, is that human nature also contains unconscious
1174760	1179120	information, not just unconscious instinct.
1179120	1183400	This is not to be considered knowledge or information of a kind that would necessarily
1183400	1189760	be parsed by a rational discursive intellect, wherever it makes itself known, it appears
1189760	1198640	not in the form of word concepts or abstract ideas, but in the form of these figures, images
1198640	1201080	or narratives.
1201080	1207080	We can see how Jung's work draws upon Freud, or serves as an elaboration upon it, and that
1207080	1213760	Jung also believes that the repressed personal unconsciousness is what lies beneath the surface
1213760	1215800	of the ego.
1215800	1222280	But Jung thinks that this repressed, unacceptable psychic content is itself only another surface
1222280	1226680	layer sitting upon this wide world of the id.
1226680	1233640	Jung describes in this essay a number of profound religious dreams, in which this vaster unconsciousness
1233720	1237960	is likened to a sea or a dark lake.
1237960	1243000	The association of the unconsciousness with water is a common symbol found in such dreams
1243000	1245640	and experiences.
1245640	1251760	Jung describes one dreamer who often saw the castle of the Grail sitting on a high mountaintop,
1251760	1257960	but found that he could only reach it by passing, quote, a darksome gorge with underworldly
1257960	1261680	water rushing along the bottom, end quote.
1261720	1266280	Another patient, a Protestant theologian, had a recurring dream in which he was standing
1266280	1271200	on a high mountain slope, looking down into the deep valley below, in which there was
1271200	1273040	a dark lake.
1273040	1277800	In the dream, he felt that something always held him back from going down to the lake,
1277800	1280480	but he decided to venture there anyway.
1280480	1286440	As he approached the water, quote, everything grew dark and uncanny, and a gust of wind suddenly
1286440	1289000	rushed over the face of the water.
1289000	1295200	He was seized by a panic fear and awoke, end quote.
1295200	1299960	Water is only one of the common symbols for a confrontation with the unconsciousness,
1299960	1304280	and a theme we can already see developing in these two example dreams is that in order
1304280	1310920	to reach a place perceived as above the psyche, the ideal, the spiritual, however we may interpret
1310920	1314680	it, one must first journey downward.
1314680	1320360	The imagery of water, of a lake or sea seems natural for the human mind, it indicates something
1320360	1326800	of which we can only see the surface, but beneath which there is an unfathomable depth.
1326800	1332280	To approach the unconsciousness is always a somewhat fearful experience because the first
1332280	1338080	layer of it contains those very repressed contents, of the contents that were repressed
1338080	1343880	by the consciousness that characterized the Freudian version of the id, far from being
1343880	1350600	strictly sexual, this unconscious layer represents everything about our public outward facing
1350600	1356600	persona that we cannot show the world or manifest in our conscious life and thought.
1356600	1363480	It is just as much our self as our waking self, but it's the dark reflection of that
1363480	1365480	waking self.
1365480	1371160	Jung writes, quote, whoever looks into the mirror of the water will see first of all
1371160	1378880	his own face, whoever goes to himself risks a confrontation with himself, the mirror does
1378880	1384440	not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it, namely the face we never show
1384440	1390920	to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of an actor, but the mirror
1390920	1395760	lies behind the mask and shows the true face, end quote.
1395760	1401080	This is what Jung calls the shadow, it is the sum total of everything about ourselves
1401080	1405640	which we have judged as negative, but it would be a mistake to think that the shadow does
1405640	1410880	not operate in the world through our conscious personality, it does not remain confined to
1410880	1413720	our unconscious thoughts or dreams.
1413720	1419200	On the contrary, Jung says that quote, the shadow is a living part of the personality
1419200	1424160	and therefore wants to live with it in some form, it cannot be argued out of existence
1424160	1428040	or rationalized into harmlessness, end quote.
1428040	1433800	The way that Jung describes the shadow as a phenomenon, a psychic phenomenon is exceedingly
1433800	1439360	fascinating because the shadow is both a terrible figure, but it is also the herald of a great
1439360	1441840	personal transformation.
1441840	1447000	Just as one must find their way across the terrible rushing waters of a dark gorge in
1447000	1451760	order to find their way to the holy grail, the shadow is the gateway to a deeper understanding
1451760	1453680	of oneself.
1453680	1460240	Jung writes in paragraph 45 of that same essay quote, the meeting with oneself is, at first,
1460240	1462240	the meeting with one's own shadow.
1462240	1467440	The shadow is a tight passage, a narrow door whose painful constriction no one has spared
1467440	1470840	who goes down to the deep well, end quote.
1470840	1476320	In order to understand how the shadow makes itself felt in our daily lives, it is essential
1476320	1480720	that we understand Jung's concept of projection.
1480720	1486400	Consciousness naturally raises certain aspects of the self into a state of conscious sovereignty,
1486400	1491760	and so long as the conscious persona is healthy, functioning, flourishing, those unconscious
1491760	1497720	contents which are unacceptable for the social life are deprived of energy, so to speak,
1497720	1499840	they're kept subordinated.
1499840	1504480	But if the conscious domain of the psyche becomes unbalanced, unhealthy in some way,
1504480	1510040	is challenged or disturbed in some serious way, those unconscious complexes will start
1510040	1515360	to take charge of it, and furthermore the unconscious contents are experienced as something
1515360	1518120	foreign to the conscious self.
1518120	1525560	Jung writes quote, the collective unconscious is anything but an encapsulated personal system.
1525560	1531280	It is sheer objectivity, as wide as the world and open to all the world.
1531280	1536160	There I am the object of every subject, in complete reversal of my ordinary consciousness
1536160	1541520	where I am always the subject that has an object, end quote.
1541520	1547760	And so, when someone's unacceptable unconscious content that Jung calls their shadow begins
1547760	1552720	to make itself forceful over the conscious personality, it is natural that we should
1552720	1557720	experience this as something external, that we should therefore project that feeling,
1557720	1562200	that complex, that type, onto the external world.
1562200	1566680	Jung clarifies in one section that this term projection should not be taken to mean that
1566680	1571520	the psyche has actually reached out into the objective world and exercised a power over
1571520	1573000	the external.
1573000	1577960	He says another term one could use for projection would be introjection, the use of external
1577960	1584280	objects or entities to symbolize some process which is actually internal to the subject,
1584280	1588640	that really we're not so much pitching the psyche out with projection so much as we are
1588640	1591040	bringing the external in.
1591040	1596640	So for an example of the shadow crashing into the psyche of an otherwise healthy mind,
1596640	1601720	suppose we have an individual who feels that aggressiveness and competition, whether it
1601720	1607040	be sports or one's career or simply social life in general, that it's inappropriate
1607040	1613320	and it's mean spirited, that one should not ever express hostility towards one's fellow
1613320	1618960	competitors, you should comport yourself with a kind of mutual respect.
1618960	1623720	You would probably all say these are admirable values for one to hold, but perhaps we can
1623720	1629160	imagine someone who feels this value of a desire for mutual respect and competition
1629160	1635240	so strongly that he always suspects that his competitors are hostile toward him.
1635240	1639600	When he loses on the football field, he assumes his opponents must be putting his team down
1639600	1642320	in their own locker room after the game.
1642320	1647160	When a coworker passes him and gets the promotion, he assumes that this person secretly hates
1647280	1649280	him or looks down upon him.
1649280	1654400	And accordingly, because all of our sportsmanship is just a false veneer in the first place,
1654400	1659200	perhaps he ends up feeling that hostility towards all of his competitors around him.
1659200	1663240	This fills him with a sense of guilt, but he reminds himself that it's really the fault
1663240	1667160	of all of those around him who have disrespected him over the years.
1667160	1671480	A Jungian might look at such a person and see that he's become possessed by his shadow
1671480	1673400	to some extent.
1673400	1677960	And in this process, he is experienced as something foreign, something alien to his
1677960	1679640	ego consciousness.
1679640	1684880	With all of his moral pretensions, that mutual respect is the basis of all friendly competition,
1684880	1689960	but he always projects his own shadow onto the behaviors of his friends and his coworkers.
1689960	1694880	The fact that it is really he who feels this deep hostility and disrespect towards others
1694880	1699800	is masked by this projection and it becomes a way for him to deal with the guilt that
1699800	1702800	he feels for feeling that way.
1702800	1706880	All of this would be in the patient's shadow self.
1706880	1710960	Jung gives an explanation in broad, somewhat poetic terms of what the person possessed
1710960	1716280	by the shadow or by their quote, inferior functions is like.
1716280	1722920	This is in concerning rebirth paragraph 222 of archetypes and the collective unconscious
1722920	1724720	quote.
1724720	1730680	The inferior function is practically identical with the dark side of the human personality,
1730680	1735280	the darkness which clings to every personality is the door into the unconscious and the gateway
1735280	1741160	of our dreams, from which those two twilight figures, the shadow and the anima, step into
1741160	1747440	our nightly visions, or remaining invisible take possession of our ego consciousness.
1747440	1752240	A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into
1752240	1754320	his own traps.
1754320	1758960	Whenever possible, he prefers to make an unfavorable impression on others.
1758960	1763840	In the long run, luck is always against him because he is living below his own level,
1763840	1768080	and at best only attains what does not suit him.
1768080	1773240	And if there is no doorstep for him to stumble over, he manufactures one for himself and then
1773240	1778600	fondly believes he has done something useful.
1778600	1782280	Jung mentions the anima there, which we will address in a little bit, but the main thing
1782280	1788240	to remember about the shadow, it's the unacceptable side of ourselves, which nevertheless exists
1788440	1792920	and sometimes motivates our actions and that we therefore project onto the external in order
1792920	1796280	to deal with the cognitive dissonance that that brings.
1796280	1800520	We would sooner see the contents of our own shadow in our friends, in our neighbors, in
1800520	1806040	our interlocutors than in ourselves, and such a person who is possessed by their shadow
1806040	1811800	will consequently bring forth the very aspect of himself that he despises and then experience
1811800	1813800	it as something alien.
1813800	1818920	We will get in our own way and then perceive that obstacle as the other.
1818920	1824040	In dreams, the shadow can appear as numerous images, sometimes as a hostile animal or a
1824040	1828120	predator, sometimes as a primitive human being.
1828120	1833520	The shadow appears throughout the mythology of mankind as an adversary or as a dark inversion
1833520	1835640	of the heroic figure.
1835640	1840720	Because the origin of these unacceptable drives or impulses is within our animal nature, the
1840720	1847320	association of the shadow with less conscious animals or more instinctive forms of life
1847320	1850000	seems somewhat obvious.
1850000	1856840	But in many cultures, Jung argues, the shadow appears in the mythology as a trickster figure.
1856840	1861920	Such a figure is something of a riddle because the trickster entities of many religions and
1861920	1867800	superstitious traditions is a sort of mixed and paradoxical character.
1867800	1871720	Jung says that there is something of the trickster in the image of the shaman and the medicine
1871720	1877320	man, the wild figure who lives at the boundaries of society but has a connection with the world
1877320	1878960	of spirits.
1878960	1884720	The poltergeist is another such example within popular folklore, in this case of a trickster
1884720	1886200	spirit.
1886200	1891280	Jung also brings up the contradictoryness of the trickster in European folklore in the
1891280	1897200	form of the devil, regarded as the ape of God, who is sometimes portrayed in the legends
1897200	1903440	as a simpleton who is easily fooled or cheated by ordinary human beings.
1903440	1908560	There are also the figures out of folktales such as Tom Thumb or Stupid Hans and one
1908560	1914440	of Grimm's fairy tales, the spirit Mercurius, who takes his name from the Greek god Mercury,
1914440	1917800	is outwitted by a simple peasant.
1917800	1923240	Jung argues in his essay Psychology of the Trickster Figure that quote, if the myth were
1923240	1928680	nothing but an historical remnant, one would have to ask why it has not long since vanished
1928680	1933320	into the great rubbish heap of the past.
1933320	1939160	Instead, the trickster still fascinates us, whether it's Mephisto and Goethe's Faust,
1939160	1945760	Loki and the Norse myths, or for that matter, Loki in the latest Marvel production, or in
1945760	1951760	the horror stories of poltergeists and other such mischievous spirits.
1951800	1957000	Jung references the strange European tradition of celebrating the trickster.
1957000	1961560	Jung believes that these fests and carnivals were in some sense rooted in the Roman holiday
1961560	1967960	of Saturnalia, in which societal roles were reversed, slaves ordered around their masters,
1967960	1968960	and so on.
1968960	1974760	In medieval Europe, the New Year was celebrated with singing and dancing, called the Fool's
1974760	1975760	Feast.
1975760	1982520	In the year 1198, apparently the festivities got so out of hand that Pope Innocent III
1982520	1989360	railed against the, quote, gests and madness that make the clergy a mockery, end quote,
1989360	1993840	and the, quote, shameless frenzy of their play acting, end quote.
1993840	1999280	And even 200 years later, a letter to the theological faculty of Paris complained that
1999280	2005520	even the clergy was getting involved with these Fool's Feasts and that they were farcically
2005520	2009520	electing a Fool's Pope during these festivities.
2009520	2015000	There was also the Festum Assenorum, the Ass Festival, or Donkey Festival.
2015000	2019520	As Jung mentions, this is referenced by Nietzsche himself and thus spoke Zarathustra, the chapter
2019520	2026520	named the Ass Festival, and in Jung's estimation that chapter of Zarathustra is, quote, a deliberately
2026520	2030840	blasphemous parody of the mass, end quote.
2030840	2036240	As Jung explains, we cannot source this apparently farcical celebration to Nietzsche himself.
2036240	2042080	These strange ecclesiastical customs are the organic products of the Middle Ages.
2042080	2047920	A procession of men marched with a donkey, decked with a golden canopy, and they marched
2047920	2052600	all the way into the church, and there the priest would conclude mass by braying three
2052600	2058600	times, like a donkey, and the priests and archbishops then played a ballgame inside
2058600	2060600	the church.
2060600	2065860	Jung writes, quote, in picker-esque tales and carnivals and revels, and magic rites of
2065860	2071320	healing and man's religious fears and exaltations, the phantom of the trickster haunts the mythology
2071320	2078560	of all ages, sometimes in quite unmistakable form, sometimes in strangely modified guise,
2078560	2084120	end quote, and a bit further in the essay Jung continues, quote, the trickster motif
2084120	2089760	does not crop up only in its mythical form, but appears just as naively and authentically
2089760	2092400	in the unsuspecting modern man.
2092400	2098120	Whenever in fact he feels himself at the mercy of annoying, quote, accidents, which thwart
2098120	2104400	his will and his actions with apparently malicious intent, he then speaks of, quote, hoodos
2104400	2109200	and jinxes, or of the mischievousness of the object.
2109200	2114320	Here the trickster is represented by counter tendencies in the unconscious, and in certain
2114320	2120640	cases by a sort of second personality of a purile and inferior character, not unlike
2120640	2126120	the personalities who announce themselves at spiritualistic sciences, and cause all those
2126120	2130520	ineffably childish phenomena so typical of poltergeists.
2130520	2134720	I have, I think, found a suitable designation for this character component when I called
2134720	2136640	it the shadow.
2136640	2142720	On the civilized level, it is regarded as a personal gaffe, slip, faux pas, etc., which
2142720	2146960	are then chalked up as defects of the conscious personality.
2146960	2151920	We are no longer aware that in carnival customs and the like, there are remnants of a collective
2151920	2157000	shadow figure which proved that the personal shadow is in part descended from a numinous
2157000	2160200	collective figure, end quote.
2160320	2162760	Just a few observations about that.
2162760	2170120	To this very day, people reference the legend of gremlins, which was very popular apparently
2170120	2173920	during Air Force pilots during World War II.
2173920	2178040	If they have random problems with a part or something of that nature, they'd say, oh,
2178040	2184120	the gremlins, these little malicious elves who get into the machinery and mess it up.
2184200	2189760	I still will say that phrase myself, and I know people will use it of like, oh, damn
2189760	2192040	gremlins, right?
2192040	2197840	When it's just apparently a random accident, we'll attribute it to a mischievous little
2197840	2204240	elf or a mischievous little fiend, or as Jung says, something of a purile and inferior
2204240	2206640	character.
2206640	2213880	And furthermore, Jung brings up toward the end there of gaffes, slips, a faux pas.
2213880	2221000	What is the Freudian slip, finding its way into Jung's psychology to some extent, that
2221000	2226880	the slips, the gaffes, the mistakes we make when we say the reverse of what we mean to
2226880	2234400	say, or an unwanted, inappropriate word finds its way into our speech, that what's happening
2234400	2241560	there is a slippage of the unacceptable contents of consciousness, or of unconsciousness that
2241560	2246920	the consciousness has suppressed, i.e. the shadow, that's what the Freudian slip is.
2246920	2254040	Now, the trickster as a figure, when it's treated as a collective figure in the mythology,
2254040	2259640	it's paradoxical because as Jung points out, in some respects, he's stupider than the animals.
2259640	2264720	He gets himself into trouble again and again in the fairy tales, and is seemingly helpless
2264720	2266400	in this.
2266400	2270800	Even though the shadow as trickster figure is not necessarily evil, quote, he does the
2270800	2276520	most atrocious things from sheer unconsciousness and unrelatedness, end quote.
2276520	2282200	And yet, the trickster, such as when he appears in the form of Mercurius, is he from whom
2282200	2285840	mortal man could win the magic power of healing.
2285840	2291640	The trickster in Jung's view is a prefiguration of the savior figure, because he leads man
2291640	2297160	on his way from a placid state of ignorance about his animal nature.
2297160	2303680	He gives us the red pill to use modern language about our animal nature, rather than, we might
2303680	2307760	say, the naive notion of the supremacy of consciousness.
2307760	2313720	Jung writes, quote, the trickster is a primitive cosmic being of a divine animal nature, on
2313720	2318280	the one hand superior to man because of his superhuman qualities, and on the other hand
2318280	2324160	inferior to him because of his unreason and his unconsciousness, end quote.
2324160	2329360	Also to recapitulate, Jung asserts that the first thing we have to confront as we begin
2329360	2336440	to integrate what is unconscious in the psyche into the conscious mind is those unacceptable
2336440	2338880	animal impulses within us.
2338880	2344160	And in fact, we find that much of our behavior is driven by these impulses, as Freud argued.
2344160	2348720	In fact, you could say all of our impulses have this animal origin.
2348720	2352800	But because we've gone through the process of civilization, we've become afflicted with
2352800	2357160	this kind of amnesia, where certain aspects have been suppressed, and the shadow is a
2357160	2361880	terrifying reminder that they're still there, even though they've been subordinated, and
2361880	2364040	they're right beneath the surface.
2364040	2370960	And therefore, we portray that figure as a paradoxical half god, half animal, something
2370960	2377760	that both lies beneath our humanity and beckons us to what might be above our humanity as
2377760	2379360	it is now.
2379360	2383920	Because the confrontation with the shadow is that first encounter with the unconscious,
2383920	2388760	which is the beginning of the psychic work needed in order to fully integrate and understand
2388760	2389760	oneself.
2389760	2393440	Still, the shadow is an incredibly dangerous thing.
2393440	2399360	It may be precisely because we have ceased to pay the collective shadow its due, that
2399360	2404360	the shadow might even pose more danger now than ever.
2404360	2407060	This is a recurring theme with Jung.
2407060	2413100	That which we do not bring into consciousness, or that which tries to breach into consciousness
2413100	2419780	and that we continually attempt to ignore, that is always what poses the most frightful
2419780	2424540	danger, whatever it is that remains in the dark.
2424540	2429640	Jung writes, quote, the so-called civilized man has forgotten the trickster.
2429640	2434880	He remembers him only figuratively and metaphorically when irritated by his own ineptitude.
2434880	2439580	He speaks of fate playing tricks on him or of things being bewitched.
2439580	2444740	He never suspects that his own hidden and apparently harmless shadow has qualities whose dangerousness
2444740	2447780	exceeds his wildest dreams.
2447780	2454000	As soon as people get together in masses and submerge the individual, the shadow is mobilized,
2454000	2461940	and as history shows, may even be personified and incarnated, end quote.
2461940	2467360	This is part of how Jung understands the psychology of crowds, what we might call mass psychology,
2467360	2473360	and it entails a real consequence if we fail to understand the archetypal contents of the
2473360	2474360	psyche.
2474360	2480080	Because when lots of individuals aggregate together, what happens is not an ever more
2480080	2486440	multifarious expression of their individuality, but a race to the most universal thought patterns
2486440	2488320	and complexes.
2488320	2491880	That's what overwhelms the individuality of each member.
2492540	2497940	As all of this unconscious content is collective, those archetypes of the collective unconsciousness
2497940	2503460	will begin to more strongly express themselves the more powerful the collective is, the more
2503460	2509220	overwhelming it is, the more the ego consciousness is submerged within the multitude.
2509220	2514180	Jung believed this was a large part of the psychology of the dangerous collectivist movements
2514180	2516980	in Europe at that time.
2516980	2521840	Just as a man who is not integrated as shadow might project that individual shadow onto
2521840	2531000	his neighbor, so too might an entire society construct a collective shadow, quote, in consequence
2531000	2536680	of the increasing repression and neglect of the original mythologians as a corresponding
2536680	2542280	projection on other social groups and nations, end quote.
2543280	2547880	Now, as the shadow is only a gateway into this world of the unconscious, we might wonder
2547880	2550440	about some of these other archetypes.
2550440	2553580	We've already mentioned one of them, the anima.
2553580	2559820	Jung argues that the anima, like all of these other figures, is not sheer mythology, which
2559820	2564420	he names as a constant prejudice of so-called scientifically-minded men whenever they encounter
2564420	2565620	his theories.
2565620	2570620	He argues that, quote, the concept of the anima is a purely empirical concept, whose
2570620	2575600	sole purpose is to give a name to a group of related or analogous psychic phenomena.
2575600	2580400	The concept does no more and means no more than, shall we say, the concept anthropods,
2580400	2585320	which includes all animals with articulated body and limbs, and so gives a name to this
2585320	2589160	phenomenological group, end quote.
2589160	2593120	This passage is useful, not just for understanding how Jung thinks about the anima, but how he
2593120	2597920	thinks about all of these archetypes, even though he constantly brings in the content
2598060	2602060	of myths and of dreams and of fantasies.
2602060	2607860	The point is to notice similarities across all of these and across individuals and cultures,
2607860	2613220	to classify these so-called dreams and fantasies as definite types, and therefore to have a
2613220	2617660	basis for inquiring empirically about these types.
2617660	2623380	Jung explains the anima in the essay, Arc Types of the Collective Unconscious, in this
2623440	2629940	passage, quote, whoever looks into the water sees his own image, but behind it living creatures
2629940	2632160	soon loom up.
2632160	2638400	Fish is presumably harmless dwellers of the deep, harmless if only the lake were not haunted.
2638400	2641880	They are water beings of a peculiar sort.
2641880	2647000	Sometimes a nixie gets into the fisherman's net, a female half-human fish.
2647020	2649620	These are entrancing creatures.
2649620	2655020	Half drew she him, half sank he down, and never more was seen.
2655020	2660780	The nixie is an even more instinctive version of a magical feminine being whom I call the
2660780	2661940	anima.
2661940	2668940	She can also be a siren, a mermaid, wood nymph, grace, or irkling's daughter, or alamia
2668940	2675740	or succubus, who infatuates young men and sucks the life out of them, end quote.
2675760	2681160	So all of these mythical figures, the nixie, the siren, the succubus, these beings are
2681160	2685280	a source of infatuation, but they're also a source of fear.
2685280	2688400	The anima is beautiful and yet dreadful.
2688400	2694600	Jung writes that many would dismiss such figures as merely flights of fancy, worthless, erotic
2694600	2695600	fantasies.
2695600	2701480	And he admits there is some truth to this, but it is not the whole truth, for such fantasies
2701480	2704720	are not explained merely by calling them fantasies.
2704720	2710100	And may, quote, complicate our psychic life in a most painful way.
2710100	2716460	She comes upon us just as a nixie might, she sits on top of us like a succubus, she changes
2716460	2722620	into all sorts of shapes, like a witch, and in general displays an unbearable independence
2722620	2727780	that does not seem at all proper in a psychic content, end quote.
2727780	2732420	These types of myths appear all over the world and are probably relatively familiar
2732440	2734400	to most of us.
2734400	2739640	Jung uses the term anima because the meaning of anima is soul, to which the German word
2739640	2742560	seal is related.
2742560	2747520	If we trace the etymology of this word to its Greek origins, we find its meaning as
2747520	2753920	quick moving, changeful of hue, twinkling, likened to the butterfly.
2753920	2757880	The soul is the breath, the magic breath that animates living beings.
2757880	2760880	That which has soul is spirited, it is moving.
2761100	2767180	Accordingly, Jung writes that the anima, quote, makes us believe incredible things that life
2767180	2769940	may be lived, end quote.
2769940	2774060	And we might think here of Schopenhauer's view of the feminine, tied in with his view
2774060	2780060	of women, as that which seduces us to continue pursuing the will to live.
2780060	2785060	Jung says that the anima, the feminine representation of the soul, is that which continually ensnares
2785060	2789620	us, bringing us back to earth, back to nature.
2789620	2794680	In fact, one can find such a representation of the feminine as both alluring and deadly
2794680	2798960	in the very Judaic creation myth found in Genesis.
2798960	2803080	Eve must convince Adam to eat of the forbidden fruit along with her.
2803080	2808120	Of course, in the Jewish and in the Christian religious morality, this makes Eve the first
2808120	2810760	sinner and Adam along with her.
2810760	2815840	But Jung also brings out this element that the feminine spurs man on to his betterment
2816020	2821900	to his elevation, which is sort of at tension with that, and perhaps a literalist take on
2821900	2824360	the biblical creation myth.
2824360	2827660	That's a theme in Goethe's Faust as well.
2827660	2832420	It is in fact the final couplet of the play sung by the Chorus Mysticus, quote, the eternal
2832420	2835780	feminine lures to perfection, end quote.
2835780	2840620	And that connection is not lost on Jung, who would argue that Goethe's play is just as
2840640	2846640	much an expression of these unconscious contents as any of our myths or ancient rituals were.
2846640	2852640	Faust is the man who has ever drawn forward with his insatiable thirst for life, never
2852640	2854520	satisfied.
2854520	2859320	And the thing that draws him forward, whether it is Gretchen as he sees her image in the
2859320	2865440	witches' mirror, or the image of Helen of Troy conjured into the modern day, it's the
2865460	2871460	feminine that represents that for which Faust is always striving but can never reach.
2871460	2876340	Helen of Troy quite literally transfigures into a cloud that Faust then grabs hold of
2876340	2879080	and then rises up into the heavens.
2879080	2885840	Jung quotes La Rochefoucault, who writes accordingly, quote, were it not for the leaping and twinkling
2885840	2892840	of the soul, man would rot away in his greatest passion, idleness, end quote.
2893840	2899540	Jung clarifies that he does not call the anima the soul in the sense of the immortal soul
2899540	2902120	found in, for example, the Catholic doctrine.
2902120	2908620	Jung refers us instead to classical sources such as Microbius or to the Taoist religion
2908620	2915120	and the philosophical system of classical Chinese thought, wherein the Po, or the Kuei,
2915120	2921320	quote, is regarded as the feminine and cathonic part of the soul, end quote.
2921400	2926200	Jung writes of the anima in archetypes of the collective unconscious, quote, it is a
2926200	2932560	factor in the proper sense of the word, man cannot make it, on the contrary, it is always
2932560	2938400	the a priori element in his moods, reactions, impulses, or whatever else is spontaneous
2938400	2944900	in psychic life, it is something that lives of itself, that makes us live, it is a life
2944900	2949720	behind consciousness that cannot be completely integrated with it, but from which, on the
2949720	2952840	contrary, consciousness arises.
2952840	2958400	For in the last analysis, psychic life is for the greater part an unconscious life that
2958400	2961640	surrounds consciousness on all sides.
2961640	2967720	Although it seems as if the whole of our unconscious psychic life could be ascribed to the anima,
2967720	2972360	she is yet only one archetype among many, therefore she is not characteristic of the
2972360	2976560	unconscious in its entirety, she is only one of its aspects.
2976560	2980000	This is shown by the very factor for femininity.
2980000	2985800	What is not I, not masculine, is most probably feminine, and because the not I is felt as
2985800	2991880	not belonging to me, and therefore as outside me, the anima image is usually projected upon
2991880	2993600	women.
2993600	2997240	Either sex is inhabited by the opposite sex up to a point.
2997240	3001680	For biologically speaking, it is simply the greater number of masculine genes that tips
3001680	3003800	the scales in favor of masculinity.
3004400	3008840	The smaller number of feminine genes seems to form a feminine character which usually
3008840	3013000	remains unconscious because of its subordinate position.
3013000	3017040	With the archetype of the anima, we enter the realm of gods, or rather the realm that
3017040	3020320	metaphysics has reserved for itself.
3020320	3027160	Everything the anima touches becomes numinous, unconditional, dangerous, taboo, magical.
3027160	3032400	She is the serpent in the paradise of the harmless man with good resolutions and still
3032400	3034400	better intentions.
3034400	3039080	She affords the most convincing reasons for not prying into the unconscious, an occupation
3039080	3044040	that would break down our moral inhibitions and unleash forces that had been better left
3044040	3046880	unconscious and undisturbed.
3046880	3048200	End quote.
3048200	3053680	So a few observations that many of you have probably already taken note of.
3053680	3058720	For one, Jung's assessment of this first major character within the metaphysical world of
3058720	3062680	the collective unconscious is that its gender is going to be the opposite of the conscious
3062680	3063680	subject.
3063680	3067600	So in the case of women, they would not possess an anima but an animus.
3067600	3072960	The anima for men or animus for women is called the soul because it's the strongest, most
3072960	3078760	powerful subpersonality within the unconscious contents, the most powerful factor in determining
3078760	3079960	our thoughts and actions.
3079960	3085040	It's the cathonic part of the soul because it's buried beneath the surface of consciousness,
3085040	3091080	but it remains soul, the thing that animates, that draws us forward, seduces us to life.
3091080	3095280	It is our image of the opposite gender contained within ourselves.
3095280	3100400	And usually, as with the shadow, we never consciously perceive this psychic force.
3100400	3102880	And thus we project it onto the opposite sex.
3102880	3107120	A man will project onto women his image of the feminine, which is something coming from
3107120	3112200	deep within his own unconsciousness and representative of his own wants and fears.
3112200	3116320	And then he'll experience his own image of the feminine as something outside of himself,
3116320	3117720	something not me.
3117720	3122960	Jung relates a number of religious visions from Christian figures, including a Cistercian
3122960	3130040	monk in the 1300s and a Swiss mystic in the 1500s, in which they saw, alongside God the
3130040	3137280	Father, God the Mother, or alongside the King of Heaven, the Queen of Heaven.
3137280	3141720	Such visions were completely inexplicable within the religious framework of European
3141720	3144080	Christianity at that time.
3144080	3150320	Such feminine interpretations of the divine had long since been excised from European
3150320	3156160	religious thought, and God was the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, a trinity which
3156160	3157560	is holy male.
3157560	3162320	I mean, maybe there's some ambiguity with the Holy Spirit, but there's not a whole
3162320	3166280	lot of female energy in that metaphor.
3166280	3170720	So where did such visions come from, in which a holy man in Europe is confronted with the
3170720	3172920	divine as female?
3172920	3180000	Again, independently of tradition, we have records of such Cisigistic visions.
3180000	3185560	Cisigy is the conjunction of two apparently opposite aspects, in this case the masculine
3185560	3189280	and feminine as both perceived as divine.
3189280	3196000	It's only natural that these two should appear as a mother-father pair, as they often do,
3196000	3199080	and this is what is signified by God the Father and God the Mother.
3199600	3203600	It should be noted at this point that this is Jung's way of dealing with the insights
3203600	3208920	of Freud of incorporating what Freud had learned about the centrality of the family relationships
3208920	3214800	to our psychic life, but without elevating the relationship with one's father and mother
3214800	3219880	to the status of ultimate importance, as if the actual tangible father and mother in your
3219880	3224480	upbringing are the determinative thing of how your psyche operates.
3224480	3228120	That there is this collective unconscious contents of the image of the father, the image
3228160	3229880	of the mother.
3229880	3235480	In effect, the mother complex is another manifestation of the anima, another mask or face of the
3235480	3244000	anima, because the anima is a numinous and alluring thing, the cathonic soul within a
3244000	3250080	young man or a young boy will naturally project the anima at first onto his mother.
3250080	3254680	The natural thing, however, is for the anima image to gradually lose its grandeur over the
3254720	3259880	course of growing up, and eventually, when we come to understand our parents as just
3259880	3267120	being ordinary human beings, and over time the anima sinks back into the unconsciousness,
3267120	3273080	although Jung argues it loses none of its tension or its productivity.
3273080	3279800	Jung then discusses the psychic effects it would have on a man to project his anima archetype
3279800	3281640	in light of this.
3281640	3286920	This is in, concerning the archetypes and the anima concept, quote,
3286920	3292720	The love life of a man reveals the psychology of this archetype in the form either of boundless
3292720	3300720	fascination, overvaluation, and infatuation, or of misogyny in all its gradations and variants,
3300720	3305160	none of which can be explained by the real nature of the quote object in question, but
3305160	3308840	only by a transference of the mother complex.
3308840	3313360	The complex, however, was caused in the first place by the assimilation of the mother, in
3313360	3319200	itself a normal and ubiquitous phenomenon, to the pre-existent feminine side of an archetypal
3319200	3324960	male-female pair of opposites, and secondly by an abnormal delay in detaching from the
3324960	3328240	primordial image of the mother.
3328240	3332320	Actually nobody can stand the total loss of the archetype.
3332320	3337680	When that happens, it gives rise to that frightful discontent in our culture where nobody feels
3337680	3342000	at home because a father and mother are always missing.
3342000	3346080	End quote, and a bit further in the essay Jung writes, quote,
3346080	3351600	The anima is a factor of utmost importance in the psychology of a man, wherever the emotions
3351600	3354600	and affects are at work.
3354600	3360360	She intensifies, exaggerates, falsifies, and mythologizes all emotional relations with
3360360	3363880	his work and with other people of both sexes.
3363880	3367480	The resultant fantasies and entanglements are all her doing.
3367480	3372640	When the anima is strongly constellated, she softens the man's character and makes him
3372640	3378840	touchy, irritable, moody, jealous, vain, and unadjusted.
3378840	3381360	End quote.
3381360	3387240	So you may have also noted thus far Jung says that completely integrating one's anima is
3387240	3390400	an impossible task.
3391040	3392760	The well of the soul is very deep.
3392760	3397560	No matter how fully you try to bring it into consciousness, some of it always recedes back
3397560	3399280	into the depths of the mind.
3399280	3401200	And so it should be, right?
3401200	3406120	Because to become fully identified with this subordinate unconscious personality would
3406120	3407680	not be a good idea.
3407680	3412560	It would be the destruction of your actual conscious personality.
3412560	3417240	But it's also not a good idea to completely banish these archetypes from our cultural
3417360	3425960	or spiritual lexicon, to attempt to excise them or to smother them entirely in unconsciousness.
3425960	3431480	And Jung does say that for young men, those who are 35 and younger, the most important
3431480	3436640	thing in his view is for a man to be a man, and that they can live with even the almost
3436640	3439160	total destruction of the anima.
3439160	3443680	It may be different, he admits, with artists and other such types who might need the anima
3443720	3449520	for their work, but it's primarily as a man begins to get older that the loss of the anima
3449520	3452280	becomes particularly dangerous.
3452280	3453280	Quote,
3453280	3458840	After the middle of life, permanent loss of the anima means a diminution of vitality,
3458840	3461600	of flexibility, and of human kindness.
3461600	3468600	The result as a rule is premature, rigidity, crustiness, stereotypy, fanatical one-sidedness,
3469600	3476600	obstinacy, pedantry, or else resignation, weariness, sloppiness, irresponsibility.
3479120	3483680	What one realizes over the course of studying archetypes is that Jung truly thinks that
3483680	3487400	these are independent sub-personalities.
3487400	3490280	They have their own life and character.
3490280	3495600	One has to reconcile with them to some extent, which means recognizing their existence and
3495600	3500880	the role they play in your psychic life, but to become completely identified with an archetype
3500880	3505400	would be just as catastrophic as trying to go to war with it.
3505400	3509760	As you may have gleaned, neither of the types we've considered so far, the shadow or the
3509760	3514200	anima, can be considered as wholly positive or wholly negative.
3514200	3519800	As terrifying as the shadow is, as the trickster, he's a sort of gateway to the ideal self,
3519800	3521960	to the savior or the redeemer.
3521960	3528960	The anima draws forward the subject into the unknown, into the unknown seas, but also threatens
3529400	3532520	the subject with the danger of drowning.
3532520	3537800	So these types are multifaceted and they also have multiple faces to them that express different
3537800	3539640	aspects of the archetype.
3539640	3543680	So the great mother archetype is a subset of the anima, which could appear as one's
3543680	3548920	personal mother or grandmother, she can appear as the mother of God, as the virgin, or as
3548920	3550240	Sophia.
3550240	3552120	These are all generally positive.
3552120	3555440	These are inspiring forms of the mother type.
3555440	3560280	But Jung writes, quote, all these symbols can have a positive favorable meaning or a
3560280	3562440	negative evil meaning.
3562440	3569720	An ambivalent aspect is seen in the goddesses of fate, Moira, Grashe, Norns.
3569720	3575320	Evil symbols are the witch, the dragon, or any devouring or entwining animal, such as
3575400	3585400	a large fish or serpent, the grave, sarcophagus, deep water, deep nightmares and bogies, impusa,
3585400	3589240	lilyth, etc.
3589240	3594080	The relationship that one will have with such archetypes will reflect their psychological
3594080	3597280	realities and the realities of their own lives.
3597280	3602680	And oftentimes the appearance of such a symbol is an unconscious hint as to some imbalance
3602680	3604880	or pathology.
3604880	3611080	If one is having repeated visitations of Mahakali in their dreams, constantly experiencing the
3611080	3616400	great mother as something terrible and all devouring, it may be an indication of anima
3616400	3620000	inflation in the person's psychology.
3620000	3623840	The sub-personality of the anima becoming all-conquering and unchallenged and beginning
3623840	3630200	to dominate and to push the conscious subject's behavior in ways that might not even be perceptible
3630200	3632280	to him.
3632280	3637040	We'll consider a few other important archetypes that Jung identifies.
3637040	3643000	Jung writes, quote, the archetype of the child god is extremely widespread and intimately
3643000	3648840	bound up with all the other mythological aspects of the child motif, end quote.
3648840	3654400	Of course, in European Christianity we have the symbolism of the Christ child, to which
3654400	3660280	we return every Christmas, it's a celebration of God's birth on earth where we see God
3660280	3662480	as the child.
3662480	3668800	Jung also, however, brings in a discussion of folklore, of dwarves and elves and little
3668800	3672960	people who inhabit the deep places and the mine shafts.
3672960	3677880	And on the other hand, the child appears as a recurring theme in mystical experience,
3677880	3681040	Meister Eckhart's vision of the naked boy.
3681040	3685880	It appears in English ghost stories, the apparition of the radiant boy.
3685880	3692480	Jung writes in psychology of the child archetype, quote, the child motif not infrequently occurs
3692480	3695600	in the field of psychopathology.
3695600	3700320	The quote imaginary child is common among women with mental disorders and is usually
3700320	3703040	interpreted in a Christian sense.
3703040	3708560	Hamonkili also appear, as in the famous Schreiber case, where they come in swarms and plague
3708560	3709560	the sufferer.
3709560	3715520	But the clearest and most significant manifestation of the child motif in the therapy of neuroses
3716200	3722000	is in the maturation process of personality induced by the analysis of the unconscious,
3722000	3725800	which I have termed the process of individuation.
3725800	3730440	Here we are confronted with pre-conscious processes, which in the form of more or less
3730440	3735720	well-formed fantasies gradually pass over into the conscious mind, or become conscious
3735720	3742440	as dreams, or lastly, are made conscious through the method of active imagination.
3742560	3748560	This material is rich in archetypal motifs, among them frequently that of the child.
3748560	3753320	Often the child is formed after the Christian model, more often though it develops from
3753320	3756400	earlier altogether non-Christian levels.
3756400	3763000	That is to say, out of catholic animals, such as crocodiles, dragons, serpents, or monkeys.
3763000	3767840	Sometimes the child appears in the cup of a flower, or out of a golden egg, or as the
3767840	3770000	center of a mandala.
3770040	3775560	In dreams it often appears as the dreamer's son or daughter, or as a boy, youth, or young
3775560	3776560	girl.
3776560	3782120	Occasionally it seems to be of exotic origin, Indian or Chinese, with a dusky skin, or appearing
3782120	3787720	more cosmically surrounded by stars, or with a starry coronet, or as the king's son, or
3787720	3791360	the witch's child with demonic attributes.
3791360	3797000	Seen as a special instance of the treasure hard to attain motif, the child motif is extremely
3797040	3803240	variable, and assumes all manner of shapes, such as the jewel, the pearl, the flower,
3803240	3808320	the chalice, the golden egg, the quaternity, the golden ball, and so on.
3808320	3813320	It can be interchanged with these, and similar images almost without limit.
3813320	3818200	So what are we to make of a passage like this?
3818200	3824480	On the one hand, Jung seems to include so many images of the child archetype, that it's
3824520	3828520	very coherence might seem to be hard to grasp.
3828520	3832840	On the other hand, what Jung is doing here is pointing to, in his view, an irrational
3832840	3838940	and arbitrary series of associations that the psyche has made between seemingly unrelated
3838940	3840760	objects or symbols.
3840760	3843280	That this is really what we might call poetic license.
3843280	3847680	It's one of the main things that seems to differentiate our thought as human beings.
3847680	3854680	We have the capability to make poetic leaps, but what this involves is associating two
3855080	3861360	different phenomena by way of metaphor, and the unconscious is similarly artistic in this
3861360	3862360	way.
3862360	3865000	It makes these metaphorical associations.
3865000	3870120	As the child archetype is the treasure hard to attain, the child could appear as a radiant
3870120	3874280	jewel or as a radiant infant.
3874280	3879640	Jung believes that the child archetype appears when one has, in some way, sundered themselves
3879640	3881560	from their own character.
3881560	3887040	What he means by this is that we can occasionally act in ways that accord more with an arbitrary
3887040	3891800	persona that we have adopted than in line with our actual values.
3891800	3896280	The way that we feel we should act, deep in our gut and our intuition.
3896280	3901920	The demands of the social life lead us to adopt such arbitrary personas, a mask that
3901920	3908200	one puts on due to the requirements of his job or his social relationships or his church
3908200	3911800	or his marriage and family life, whatever it might be.
3911800	3916120	We might be forced to make ourselves appear as something that we're not, and so far as
3916120	3920600	our inner feelings might be completely at odds with our outward persona.
3920600	3927400	If we then act according to the needs or desires of this artificial character that we've created,
3927400	3930760	we may then encounter the child archetype.
3930760	3937480	Jung says that one sees the child, for example, in dreams, when he becomes, quote, unchildlike
3937480	3944280	and artificial, end quote, and when he, quote, has lost his roots, end quote.
3944280	3951000	The thing hard to attain, then, somewhat conjures the imagery of one's childhood.
3951000	3956960	But Jung argues this is not purely a yearning for some romantic version of one's youth
3956960	3959360	or one's childhood days.
3959360	3964400	Jung says that, quote, the child motif represents not only something that existed in the distant
3964400	3970520	past, but also something that exists now, that is to say, it is not just a vestige but
3970520	3975360	a system functioning in the present, whose purpose is to compensate or correct, in a
3975360	3981520	meaningful manner, the inevitable one-sidedness and extravagances of the conscious mind, end
3981520	3983560	quote.
3983560	3989080	This is why the child motif occurs when patients are undergoing what Jung calls individuation.
3989080	3994680	They come to realize the ways in which artificial personas have compromised their values.
3994680	4000000	The child is a symbol of one's creativity, of the innocent self-absorption in one's
4000000	4005540	setting, a presentness of thought and attitude.
4005540	4010160	The child motif, therefore, suggests to us that, yes, we have lived in this manner in
4010160	4015400	the past, and that there is a possibility to return there in the future, to get it over
4015400	4018320	the one-sidedness, as Jung calls it.
4018400	4029280	The child, therefore, represents not the past, but the future.
4029280	4035920	The child promises some future possibility of individuation or wholeness, and, therefore,
4035920	4042100	its appearance is like Virgil appearing to Dante when he's lost in the wood of error.
4042100	4045360	The radiant child appears to you when you become lost.
4045360	4051280	The child motif, therefore, often depicts a child hero or a child god, a figure which
4051280	4056240	is at once vulnerable but indestructible.
4056240	4061400	He's often born into danger or privation, as Moses was placed into the river by his
4061400	4067280	birth mother so that he could survive, or Jesus' mother giving birth to him in a manger.
4067280	4071740	He's smaller than small and bigger than big at the same time.
4071740	4075940	The child is always there in our mind as an eternal warning or a sign that we have gone
4075940	4080580	astray in order that we may set right our course.
4080580	4085580	A child is vulnerable because we know that in this world we're often in real danger
4085580	4090100	of completely losing our connection to that innocence, that creativity that is the healthy
4090100	4092220	state of the soul.
4092220	4097580	And obviously, at this point, it bears mentioning the child is that final transfiguration of
4097580	4102140	the spirit in Nietzsche's schema as he gives it in Zarathustra's prologue.
4102140	4108180	And so from this, a Jungian analysis might lead us to suspect that Nietzsche gravitated
4108180	4113180	to the child motif because he unconsciously understood the role of the child as a sign
4113180	4117340	and symbol of self-transformation and individuation.
4117340	4123220	And perhaps Nietzsche was able to perceive this because he himself may have been someone
4123220	4129660	at odds with his, between his outer persona and his inner values, so to speak, perhaps
4129660	4136260	during the latter days of his teaching at Basel or his time spent among the Wagnerians.
4136260	4140340	Another important archetypal figure is the wise old man.
4140340	4147180	He can appear as an old king, a wisened magician, a father, or a grandfather.
4147180	4153980	In mythology, he is Odin, Osiris, Jupiter, arguably the image of the wise old man as
4153980	4158500	an archetype is painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
4158500	4163620	This seems to have been the archetype that Michelangelo used to portray God.
4163620	4170580	The wise old man is the superior, the master, the teacher, and in some way represents the
4170580	4174220	anchoring wisdom on which one's life is based.
4174220	4179620	The wise old man is the superstructure of one's thought, one's morality, their understanding
4179620	4184940	of the reality they inhabit and how they fit into that reality.
4184940	4189340	Jung says that when one's worldview, their way of comprehending themselves, is profoundly
4189340	4194820	challenged, this is often when the wise old man appears.
4194820	4200580	Perhaps for example, when one is losing their religion, Jung relates the story of a young
4200580	4207660	theologian who had a dream in which two wise old magicians appeared to him, a white magician
4207660	4211900	wearing black robes and a black magician wearing white robes.
4211900	4216660	In the dream, the black magician tells the story of an old king from a far away land
4216660	4220820	who had scoured all the land searching for a tomb for himself.
4220820	4224940	In his land were many great old tombs and he wished to find the best, but when they
4224940	4230260	found one in which a virgin had been buried, they exhumed her bones.
4230260	4235420	His bones didn't stay dead, but got up, formed into a black horse which then galloped across
4235420	4236820	the desert.
4236820	4242300	The magician followed the horse until he found grassland and the horse grazing there.
4242300	4247600	He'd now found the keys to paradise and did not know what to do with them.
4247600	4252020	This is perhaps the most Jungian dream I've ever heard, so kudos to Jung for managing
4252020	4256860	to get this one from someone he says he did not even know personally, I mean it's just
4256860	4258660	incredible.
4258660	4262220	But in any case, this theologian was going through something in his life at the time,
4262220	4267700	which was of monumental importance, a shift or a transformation that could have life-altering
4267700	4269420	consequences.
4269420	4276300	That is Jung says, quote, he was in great straits because of his religious beliefs, end quote.
4276300	4280740	Which is a bit vague, but if we read between the lines, we can infer that in some ways
4280740	4286900	that theologian's beliefs probably drifted from those which were acceptable, maybe according
4286940	4291300	to the dogma of the seminary, perhaps he was losing his faith altogether, we don't really
4291300	4292460	know.
4292460	4297820	In any case, he was confronted with the strong drive to leave behind the current mental structure
4297820	4304220	of his worldview, to lay to rest the old king, so to speak, and thus to strike out across
4304220	4306140	the desert.
4306140	4308380	And what is it that strikes out across the desert?
4308380	4313660	Well it's the black horse, which is formed from the bones of the virgin buried in the
4313660	4315820	tomb in the old country.
4315820	4322140	So the anima, the soul we might say, has become dead, dry, dusty bones within the reign of
4322140	4324220	an old kingdom.
4324220	4328820	And once the king decided to lay himself to rest, so to speak, the soul jumps up.
4328820	4332500	It runs out into the unknown until it finds a new green pasture.
4332500	4336940	And by following it, following the drive of the soul, the black magician finds the keys
4336940	4344940	to paradise, the treasure hard to obtain, the holy grail, the return to the walled garden.
4344940	4351460	Jung writes, quote, the two magicians are indeed two aspects of the wise old man, the
4351460	4356940	superior master and teacher, the archetype of the spirit who symbolizes the pre-existent
4356940	4360260	meaning hidden in the chaos of life.
4360260	4365020	He is the father of the soul, and yet the soul in some miraculous manner is also his
4365020	4371940	virgin mother, for which reason he was called by the alchemists the first son of the mother.
4371940	4377300	The black magician and the black horse correspond to the descent into darkness and the dreams
4377300	4379300	mentioned earlier.
4379300	4383460	What an inappropriately hard lesson for a young student of theology.
4383460	4387900	Fortunately, he was not in the least sense aware that the father of all prophets had
4387900	4393220	spoken to him in the dream and placed a great secret almost within his grasp.
4393220	4399340	One marvels at the inappropriateness of such occurrences.
4399340	4404500	There is another famous idea of the archetype of the wise man that can be found in the literature,
4404500	4407620	and we're all familiar with it here.
4407620	4409380	Zarathustra himself.
4409380	4414700	Jung writes that Zarathustra is Nietzsche's psychic image of, quote, the enlightener,
4414700	4419980	the master and teacher, a psychopomp whose personification even Nietzsche, that breaker
4419980	4423780	of tablets, could not escape, end, quote.
4423780	4428540	Jung continues in the same passage, and I'm reading here in an abridged form, quote, for
4428540	4434580	him God was dead, but the driving demon of wisdom became, as it were, his bodily double.
4434580	4438420	Zarathustra is more for Nietzsche than a poetic figure.
4438420	4444460	He is an involuntary confession, a testament, end, quote.
4444460	4449380	Jung argues that in the nihilistic darkness that Nietzsche, in the wake of abandoning
4449380	4457300	God and abandoning Christianity, he created a void that required a figure that would speak
4457300	4461380	in the hieratic language of Zarathustra.
4461380	4467300	He chooses, as the image of this figure, one of the founders of the world religions, a
4467300	4473620	prophet of ancient times, a man who divided good and evil.
4473620	4480500	Zarathustra proclaims the relativity and relatedness of good and evil, and Nietzsche's version
4480500	4481820	of events.
4481820	4486300	This is Zarathustra as the first man to make the distinction, also being the first to realize
4486300	4488540	his mistake.
4488540	4494620	But we might also notice, in the dream of the theologian that Jung described, we see the
4494620	4499260	symbolism of the relativity of good and evil there, too, in the figures of the white and
4499260	4505580	black magicians, both of whom are wise men, both of whom have mismatched names.
4505580	4510980	Jung argues that this perceived interdependence of good and evil, far from being an invention
4510980	4517460	of Nietzsche's mind, is one of the oldest bits of wisdom in human religiosity.
4517460	4521820	Jung cites a saying from India that the man who loves God will take seven lifetimes to
4521820	4526660	reach perfection, while the man who hates him will take only three lifetimes.
4526660	4531180	And this is because the man who hates God will think of him more often.
4531180	4536580	Jung also suggests that this relativity, this freedom from opposition, due to a perception
4536580	4542020	of their functional equivalence, is also found in Taoist philosophy.
4542020	4546900	For that, one might look to the Zhuangzi, or to the Dao De Ching.
4546900	4552100	While this may offend mainline Christian sensibilities, there are even strains of Christian thought
4552100	4556700	in which God's allowance of evil in the world is seen as a good thing, because it allows
4556700	4559460	for the overcoming of sin.
4559460	4566540	Or in Hebrew, the Yatzahara, the evil inclination, the inclination of man to sin, which is considered
4566660	4569500	to be in itself valuable.
4569500	4574980	It was placed there by God for a good reason, because in the overcoming of sin we glorify
4574980	4576780	God.
4576780	4581540	Zarathustra then speaks some of that same wisdom of the ultimate relativity of good
4581540	4588220	and evil, the dependence of one upon the other, and he stands as a wise religious teacher,
4588220	4590740	in a world darkened by the death of God.
4590740	4598060	These niches creation of a mystical wise man out of a deep need, the deeply felt absence
4598060	4601220	of this anchoring structure for our thought.
4601220	4607500	And so Zarathustra becomes yet another figure who teaches us the pre-existent meaning behind
4607500	4611220	the chaos of life, which is the meaning of the wise old man.
4611220	4617340	That figure of the wise man as teacher, Jung says, is one of the type's definite aspects,
4617340	4622740	appearing in mythology as Hermes, Trismegistus, Thoth, Orpheus.
4622740	4629700	Quote, if the name Lucifer were not prejudicial, it would be a very suitable one for this archetype.
4629700	4634660	But I have been content to call it the archetype of the wise old man, or of meaning.
4634660	4639540	Like all archetypes, it has a positive and a negative aspect.
4639540	4642260	End quote.
4642260	4648100	Every one of these archetypes we've discussed so far has so many variations in which it
4648100	4652660	can appear, and there's just so much more that can be said about each of these archetypes
4652660	4656100	than could be said in a single episode.
4656100	4662340	And Jung wishes to stress that what he is imparting to us in his work is more than anything
4662340	4669100	a language, a lexicon, a kind of rough guide, a guide to the perplexed for those who wish
4669100	4672500	to embark on that project of individuation.
4672500	4675860	Moving from a state of inner turmoil to a state of health.
4675860	4680660	Jung's understanding of the psyche is not, by any means, to be taken as a dogmatic set
4680660	4685340	of inflexible truths that we should refer to in lieu of experience.
4685340	4690300	Furthermore, he stresses that when it comes to dealing with these archetypes, these sub-complexes
4690300	4696060	of the mind, there is nothing that he can give us that will serve as an easy set of
4696060	4699420	do-it-yourself instructions that will work in all cases.
4699420	4702980	The concrete situation of the person is what matters.
4702980	4705940	Everyone has their own unique battle to fight.
4705940	4710860	Jung writes, quote, it is not sufficient just to know about these concepts and to reflect
4710860	4716300	on them, nor can we ever experience their content by feeling our way into them, or by
4716300	4719180	appropriating other people's feelings.
4719180	4723060	It is no use at all to learn a list of archetypes by heart.
4723060	4727820	Types are complexes of experience that come upon us like fate and their effects are felt
4727820	4729980	in our most personal life.
4729980	4736100	The anima no longer crosses our path as a goddess, but it may be as an intimately personal
4736100	4740660	misadventure, or perhaps as our best venture.
4740660	4745660	When for instance a highly esteemed professor in his seventies abandons his family and runs
4745660	4751260	off with a young red-headed actress, we know that the gods have claimed another victim.
4751260	4755100	This is how demonic power reveals itself to us.
4755100	4760620	Until not so long ago, it would have been an easy matter to do away with the young woman
4760620	4764340	as a witch, end quote.
4764340	4769980	And so Jung thinks that we are not in any way wiser than the type of people Jung here
4769980	4775100	calls primitives, people who have continued to live according to the life patterns of
4775100	4781220	say pre-industrial society, or even pre-agricultural society, who continue to see the world in
4781220	4784860	terms of these myths and rituals.
4784860	4790780	Jung writes, quote, the primitive mentality does not invent myths, it experiences them,
4790780	4792460	end quote.
4792460	4795940	Their way of thinking about their own mind is more honest than ours.
4795940	4800540	They still speak in a language of gods and spirits, but their understanding of the self
4800540	4807060	is not corrupted by these modern notions of the voluntarily governing ego who lives autonomously
4807060	4810060	and acts autonomously, thinks autonomously.
4810060	4814340	Such a way of thinking just ignores the reality of the unconscious drives.
4814340	4820020	And so Jung writes, and this is in Psychology of the Child archetype, paragraph 260 of the
4820020	4827220	collected works volume 9, quote, in the individual, the archetypes appear as involuntary manifestations
4827220	4832580	of unconscious processes whose existence and meaning can only be inferred, whereas the
4832580	4837340	myth deals with traditional forms of incalculable age.
4837340	4842900	They hark back to a prehistoric world whose spiritual preconceptions and general conditions
4842900	4846700	we can still observe today in existing primitives.
4846700	4852380	Myths on this level are as a rule tribal history handed down from generation to generation
4852380	4854420	by word of mouth.
4854420	4859180	Primitive mentality differs from the civilized chiefly in that the conscious mind is far
4859180	4862460	less developed in scope and intensity.
4862460	4867980	Primitives such as thinking, willing, etc. are not yet differentiated, they are pre-conscious,
4867980	4872260	and in the case of thinking, for instance, this shows itself in the circumstance that
4872260	4877420	the primitive does not think consciously, but that thoughts appear.
4877420	4882500	The primitive cannot assert that he thinks, it is rather something that thinks in him.
4882500	4888060	The spontaneity of the act of thinking does not lie causally in his conscious mind, but
4888060	4892760	in his unconscious.
4892760	4896780	This is, in effect, the Nietzschean picture of thought as well, as he discusses in Beyond
4896780	4902500	Good and Evil, that the true vital germ of thought, even philosophical thought, is a
4902500	4909620	drive, some sort of unconscious motivation, which may be moral or immoral, that the constitutive
4909620	4916100	element of thought is not truth, or the will to seek the truth, but that it is the will
4916140	4918940	to truth of a drive.
4918940	4923420	Jung's further elaboration on this notion of Nietzsche's is simply that he dares to
4923420	4929260	identify the different types of certain definite complexes of thought.
4929260	4933380	We might call them complexes of feelings, or of sentiments, or of impulses, but all
4933380	4937140	such complexes have their own form of reasoning as well.
4937140	4943740	To return to that first essay we discussed archetypes of the collective unconscious,
4943740	4949700	Jung makes it clear that this way of thinking, understood by the primitive mythologically,
4949700	4955700	is how Jung would describe our thought, albeit with the modern language of psychoanalysis.
4955700	4956700	Quote,
4956700	4962540	There is no single important idea or view that does not possess historical antecedents.
4962540	4968100	Ultimately, they are founded on primordial archetypal forms whose concreteness dates
4968100	4973100	from a time when consciousness did not think but only perceived.
4973100	4978420	Thoughts were objects of interperception, not thought at all but sensed as external phenomena,
4978420	4980620	seen or heard, so to speak.
4980620	4985740	Thought was essentially revelation, not invented but forced upon us, or bringing conviction
4985740	4989140	through its immediacy and actuality.
4989140	4993740	Thinking of this kind precedes the primitive ego consciousness, and the latter is more its
4993740	4996260	object than its subject.
4996260	5001580	But we ourselves have not yet climbed the last peak of consciousness, so we have a pre-existent
5001580	5007180	thinking of which we are not aware so long as we are supported by traditional symbols,
5007180	5015220	or to put it in the language of dreams, so long as the father or the king is not dead.
5015220	5017780	End quote.
5017780	5024500	What Jung offers us is, in a description that may seem somewhat reductivist or anti-climatic,
5024500	5026500	a table of categories.
5026500	5031260	And I should note, I don't mean it in a reductive way, I think his table of categories is incredibly
5031260	5036800	useful, and that it is at least hard to argue that there aren't certain definite repeated
5036800	5041140	types that appear in the mythic landscape of human thought.
5041140	5047340	Many today still balk at these ideas, however, but I would simply ask, what is their alternative?
5047340	5054060	There is no recognizable pattern, no recognizable meaning within the human psyche whatsoever.
5054060	5060660	There's nothing that unites humanity cross-culturally, that the individual pathologies of human beings
5060660	5065340	are so peculiar or unique or random that we can't make any descriptive sense of them
5065340	5067940	at all as categories.
5067940	5073140	I think that is, funnily enough, a fairly unscientific way of viewing the human mind,
5073140	5078420	which is funny because people often accuse Jung of being unscientific.
5078420	5082580	I think whether you agree with Jung or not, he provides us with a useful tool set, a useful
5082580	5087300	lexicon for approaching the human mind, and a fascinating commentary on the relation of
5087300	5091100	psychology to the world's religions and cultures.
5091100	5095700	But of course Jung also relates to Nietzsche in a far deeper way than merely carrying on
5095700	5096700	his influence.
5096700	5101660	In many ways Jung was a critic of Nietzsche, he strongly disagreed with many of Nietzsche's
5101660	5106180	moral conclusions, and furthermore he was one of the first critics to analyze Nietzsche's
5106180	5110100	philosophy in consideration of his mental illness.
5110100	5114340	This critical relationship between Jung and Nietzsche, however, I think is a very rich
5115340	5120340	Much like the criticism of Socrates by Nietzsche, Jung is often times in a kind of struggle
5120340	5124940	with Nietzsche in his writing, and even though his philosophy thoroughly rebukes the Nietzschean
5124940	5130180	moral and cultural project, there's a sense in which Jung recognizes Nietzsche's viewpoint
5130180	5134700	as valuable and as indispensable for the development of his own thought.
5134700	5139340	It's in response to Nietzsche that some of Jung's most profound ideas are created.
5140340	5144340	We're going to talk about that next time when we invite Nietzsche to come in, take a seat,
5144340	5149340	lie down, whatever makes you more comfortable here, Nietzsche, as you're about to be psychoanalyzed.
5149340	5155340	Join me then for Nietzsche on Jung's couch, Jung's psychoanalytic critique of Nietzsche
5155340	5157340	and his ideas.
5157340	5159340	Signing off.
5170340	5176340	Or just share the show with any of your friends that you think might enjoy it or on social media.
5176340	5178340	Thank you for your support.
