0	11000	We first discussed Nietzsche's infamous aphorism entitled The Madman way back in the early days of the podcast, I think Episode 3.
11000	29000	This is the aphorism that contains Nietzsche's famous declaration that God is dead, that all that man once aspired to, all that man once saw as his noble ideal, all that anchored us and gave meaning to our lives and the suffering within our lives.
30000	34000	That great idea of God would not survive modernity.
34000	44000	For Nietzsche, this is the most momentous and calamitous of events, but it is above all the blunt reality.
44000	53000	Our situation in the modern world is that we have to move on from the Christian God and create ourselves anew in the light of that knowledge.
54000	61000	That we must impart meaning to our own lives, craft new ideals, anchor our understanding of reality by new means.
61000	70000	The entire revaluation of values takes place in the wake of God's death, and it's only really comprehensible as a response to God's death.
70000	74000	This is why it's such a foundational concept in approaching Nietzsche.
74000	85000	His whole mature philosophy exists in the aftermath of the death of God, and I would dare say that it would be incoherent for anyone who has not perceived this.
85000	92000	Nietzsche's answer to this challenge is also taken up by Freud, Jung's former mentor.
92000	99000	For both Nietzsche and Freud, the looming end of Christianity that was unfolding in modernity was truly the end of Christianity.
99000	106000	The answer was psychology, a grounding of our understanding of mankind in naturalistic terms.
106000	113000	For whatever their differences, both Nietzsche and Freud would argue that the only way out is forward.
113000	120000	A return to the mental framework of a mythological past does not seem to be an option for the modern man.
120000	132000	Nietzsche writes not in favor of a romantic return, but an active nihilism, a critique of all modern values, the full recognition of the way in which the highest values have devalued themselves.
132000	139000	This lays waste to the whole field of moral ideas, but that may clear the way for new possibilities.
139000	149000	Myths may ever remain a profound source of meaning, but Nietzsche and Freud see in the gods evidence of one's physiological drives in impulses.
149000	156000	Where Jung differs is that he sees in one's physiological impulses the evidence of the gods.
156000	167000	Jung, in effect, comes to the opposite conclusions of Freud, that the significance found in myth and religion is so profound that we ought to understand psychology in terms of myth,
167000	173000	rather than attempt to psychologize away the apparent significance of myth.
173000	181000	Jung's judgment, his evaluation of the situation for the modern man, is profound, and it's radical.
181000	189000	Jung perceives that these archetypal subcomplexes seem to appear independently of tradition or culture,
189000	196000	and he argues that we should treat them precisely in accordance with all that this discovery demands.
196000	207000	That is, treat the archetypes as independent, definite entities, real beings, spirits, so to speak, perhaps even deities.
207000	218000	At least that's the way they would have been understood mythologically, and given that they do seem to appear independent of these factors of culture or upbringing,
218000	224000	it's just further evidence of the fact that they should be afforded this kind of respect or awe.
224000	233000	Jung sees the ways in which the modern lexicon for understanding ourselves, for understanding the psyche, has become impoverished.
233000	244000	How it has overestimated the ego, overestimated the benign nature of man, or the goodness of man, overestimated the power of rationality.
245000	254000	In all of these respects, he agrees with Nietzsche, but Jung draws attention to the fact that the mindset of people who lived in the ages of so-called mythic thinking
254000	265000	was far closer to the truth of the self than our modern, essentialist view of the ego consciousness as this arbitrary, rational ruler.
265000	278000	Jung's work with schizophrenic patients, his study of dreams, and his tour of the world's religions, this had all convinced him that there was a concrete truth to religion that could not simply be hand-waved away.
278000	285000	Perhaps we could say, at the very least, a concrete usefulness or utility to religion.
285000	296000	That it was our only way to confront the numinous, the mysterious, the most important events of life, coming of age, self-transformation, passing into death, and so on and so forth.
296000	305000	It is the very fact that Jung can easily observe in his patients that they unconsciously employ religious symbolism.
306000	316000	This convinces him that, in fact, God is not dead in the sense that Nietzsche means this utterance, that we may have the pretensions of having done away with God,
316000	324000	but perhaps this only really applies in the realm of the rational intellect that now lives in a sort of mechanistic world.
325000	335000	But in the unconsciousness God lives on, that God's still are the set of symbols that we use to express that type of thinking.
335000	347000	And so it seems almost incredible that Nietzsche, a man who was suspicious of the powers of the intellect and emphasized the relative dominance of the unconscious part of the psyche,
347000	353000	could have construed the death of God as some sort of objective event or objective happening.
353000	363000	Because after all, such an event has only happened in the terms understood by the ego consciousness and its representations of reality.
363000	372000	That is to say that the divine is part of the independently living world of spirits that exists in the collective unconsciousness,
372000	378000	which is larger and more complex than any mask which the consciousness gives to it.
378000	385000	That we have oftentimes changed our symbols for the divine in accord with the perception of the age,
385000	394000	but this transfiguration from one symbol to another is not indicative of the final death and repose of the divine as such,
394000	400000	but part of a cycle of death and rebirth which is itself part of that divine language.
400000	407000	God is part of our inner life, a self bigger than the ego with its pretensions to total freedom.
407000	411000	God in one form or another may slip away from us.
411000	415000	One divine symbol autonomously departs from our sight.
415000	418000	But Jung writes about this quote,
419000	424000	Because this inner life is intrinsically free and not subject to our will and intentions,
424000	431000	it may easily happen that the living thing chosen and defined by us will drop out of its setting,
431000	434000	the man-made image, even against our will.
434000	437000	Then perhaps we could say with Nietzsche, God is dead.
437000	444000	Yet it would be truer to say, he has put off our image and where shall we find him again?
444000	451000	The interregnum is full of danger, for the natural facts will raise their claim in the form of various isms,
451000	454000	which are productive of nothing but anarchy and destruction,
454000	464000	because inflation and man's hybris between them have elected to make the ego with all its ridiculous paltryness, Lord of the Universe.
464000	470000	That was the case with Nietzsche, the uncomprehended portent of a whole epoch.
470000	472000	End quote.
472000	480000	Jung here references the fact that Nietzsche predicted massive violence in the rise of new political ideologies
480000	484000	as attempts to grapple with the coming nihilism.
484000	489000	This is the great prophecy of Nietzsche that concerns the history of the coming two centuries, as he says,
489000	494000	which I've often filled later interpreters of Nietzsche with terror and wonder,
494000	499000	as we're all struck in the present day with how accurate Nietzsche's predictions were.
500000	506000	The isms in light of retrospective analysis would, of course, be communism, Nazism,
506000	509000	these outbursts within the interregnum.
509000	514000	The meaning of that word is the period between kings, usually a time of unrest or civil war.
514000	520000	To use the language of myth, when one old king meets his downfall, there's a period in which there's a great danger.
520000	526000	The society finds itself beyond the protection of a perceived order to the world,
526000	530000	and another king must rise up to take charge of the kingdom.
530000	535000	Still, Jung's remarks about Nietzsche's egotism are biting.
535000	540000	It's striking that a man who disparaged the ego consciousness so much,
540000	547000	who had so little regard for its pretensions, would nevertheless be, for all intents and purposes, so egotistical.
547000	556000	So, confident in his own strength to endure hard truths and live in the moral, ideological desert
556000	561000	beyond the approval of the collective and so on, Jung continues in the same passage, quote,
561000	564000	The individual ego is much too small.
564000	569000	Its brain is much too feeble to incorporate all the projections withdrawn from the world.
569000	572000	Ego and brain burst asunder in the effort.
572000	575000	The psychiatrist calls it schizophrenia.
575000	581000	When Nietzsche said God is dead, he uttered a truth which is valid for the greater part of Europe.
581000	588000	People were influenced by it not because he said so, but because it stated a widespread psychological fact.
588000	594000	The consequences were not long delayed after the fog of isms, the catastrophe.
594000	598000	Nobody thought of drawing the slightest conclusions from Nietzsche's pronouncement,
598000	605000	yet it has, for some ears, the same eerie sound as that ancient cry which came echoing over the sea
605000	608000	to mark the end of the nature gods.
608000	612000	Great Pan is dead, end quote.
612000	617000	The story that Jung references here is a strange one.
617000	621000	It's a sort of fable that comes to us through the historical record.
621000	629000	It almost reads like a rumor or just a strange story that was bandied about the Uso Bar in ancient Greece,
629000	633000	but it's an example of what Jung called synchronicity,
633000	640000	where events which are seemingly unrelated in terms of causality, in terms of the material world,
640000	644000	are nevertheless related in terms of their underlying meaning.
644000	648000	They're related in a deeper way than our rationality can explain.
648000	655000	We find this story in Jung's notes from a seminar on Nietzsche's Zarathustra given in the 1930s.
655000	660000	The background context of the conversation is Jung's assessment of Nietzsche,
660000	666000	what he calls Nietzsche's inflation with an archetype, in this case, with Zarathustra.
666000	671000	In Jung's view, any one of the archetypes can become inflated,
671000	679000	meaning that within the community of drives, impulses, sub complexes within one's unconscious,
679000	683000	one particular complex begins swallowing up a great deal of energy,
683000	688000	growing larger than the others, literally becoming inflated, you can use that image.
688000	695000	And eventually the inflation reaches a point where the individual begins to consciously identify with the archetype.
695000	705000	It becomes a kind of usurpacious persona, to where it becomes so big that it swells to include the ego consciousness within it.
705000	708000	So this is an excerpt from that seminar.
708000	711000	Dr. Jung.
711000	715000	For Nietzsche, the world was always exceedingly dull.
715000	721000	Nobody had ears or eyes or a feeling heart, so he had to knock at the doors with a sledgehammer.
721000	727000	But when people locked the doors, he attacked them with such fearful words that they became frightened.
727000	733000	His contemporary Jacob Burkhart, the famous historian, grew quite afraid when he read Zarathustra,
733000	737000	as I know from people in Basel who were acquainted with them both.
737000	739000	It was uncanny to him.
739000	741000	It was the language that overcame him.
741000	746000	He shut the door to Nietzsche because he was too troublesome, he made too big a noise,
746000	751000	and one always has the impression in reading Zarathustra that it does not really reach people.
751000	757000	Nietzsche felt that too, and therefore he increased the weight of it in order to make it sink in.
757000	762000	If only he would wait, be a bit more patient, a bit less noisy, then it would sink in.
762000	768000	Certain passages in Zarathustra are of supreme beauty, but others are in very bad taste,
768000	772000	and the effect of the whole is somewhat endangered by that style.
772000	780000	Those are the main reasons for it then, but there is still another point which explains the extraordinary weight of Zarathustra.
780000	782000	Mrs. Adler
782000	790000	It is because the aspirations or intuitions are not quite real, and therefore they need a particular emphasis, as it were, against Nietzsche,
790000	794000	as if he were preaching to himself in the first place.
794000	796000	Dr. Jung
796000	798000	That is a very subtle point of view.
798000	805000	It is surely a valid argument, since there is plenty of evidence that what we would call realization had not taken place.
805000	807000	Mrs. Baines
807000	812000	I don't understand what Mrs. Adler means by there not being quite real to him.
812000	814000	Dr. Jung
814000	822000	It would mean, in this case, not quite realized, as a matter of fact, when there is an inflation by an archetype, there is no realization.
822000	825000	One cannot realize the thing by which one is inflated.
825000	831000	First, the inflation must have come to an end, and then one may realize, not before.
831000	833000	Dr. Reichstein
833000	839000	Perhaps it was because Nietzsche was against the whole world, and so he had to knock very hard.
839000	841000	Dr. Jung
841000	843000	Yes, that is quite certain.
843000	851000	Nietzsche was in a sort of fighting position against the whole contemporary world, and it gave him a peculiar feeling of inefficiency that his words reached nowhere,
851000	853000	no echo anywhere.
853000	855000	That really was the case.
855000	857000	Nobody cared.
857000	863000	His was the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, and so naturally he would increase his voice instead of lowering it.
863000	873000	You see, when one is not understood, one should, as a rule, lower one's voice, because when one really speaks loudly enough and is not heard, it is because people don't want to hear.
873000	877000	One had better begin to mutter to oneself than they get curious.
877000	879000	End quote.
879000	892000	So, lots of very clever remarks from Jung and his colleagues in this excerpt from the seminar, but Jung's main criticism here is actually an attack on the style of Zarathustra, which is interesting.
892000	899000	Some passages are beautiful, others in bad taste, and he sees this as a result of Nietzsche forcing certain things.
899000	912000	And one of Jung's students suggests that this forcing is a result of the fact that Nietzsche may not have fully realized the truths contained in the book, that he is preaching to himself as much as to everyone else,
912000	914000	that's the way they put it.
914000	927000	Jung believes this is a valid point of view on Nietzsche's work, and it is a variation on the common refrain among Nietzsche's critics that Nietzsche himself was not a hard, immoral, tyrannical kind of man.
927000	931000	By all accounts, he was a kind, moral gentleman.
931000	941000	Well, didn't Nietzsche say that one does not have a quote-unquote right to all truths, and that for this very reason, that truth can't be regarded as universal?
941000	949000	Perhaps it was the case that Nietzsche himself did not have a right to every last truth that he wrote in the Spokes Zarathustra.
949000	968000	And so the Jungian view of the situation would be, this is because as the archetype is inflating itself and taking over Nietzsche's psyche, he as the whole subject is not actually coming into the realization of the truths known by the archetype.
968000	975000	He does not gain a right to them to use Nietzsche's language, just merely on the basis of the archetypal inflation.
975000	983000	And there's still the truths of someone else, because Zarathustra is operating as a kind of autonomous subpersonality at this point.
983000	996000	And so perhaps because Zarathustra sort of confronts Nietzsche with certain ideas, perhaps his most dangerous, blasphemous, or harsh ideas, that Nietzsche himself does not fully believe,
996000	1004000	and by this we mean, does not fully realize in his life maybe, he does not live these ideas, he does not have a right to them.
1004000	1017000	Perhaps his work is forced in some places, or it feels forced, the style, because he's preaching to himself, trying to get himself to adopt ideas that are not really his.
1017000	1027000	And the way that Nietzsche talks about the experience of writing Zarathustra, he says that the ideas just sort of flashed before him like lightning.
1027000	1034000	That this truly was a book written by a muse, he often uses that language in talking about it.
1034000	1046000	And so there is somewhat of a basis in the textual evidence for Jung's position here, and in my view this is the most biting thing that Jung says.
1046000	1057000	Because it's a criticism not just of Nietzsche's ideas, but of his style, and a work that is, it must be said, perhaps the most vulnerable to that kind of criticism.
1057000	1060000	This is not an arbitrary critique.
1060000	1073000	It flows out of an underlying charge that the failures in Nietzsche's style, wherever they arise on Zarathustra, wherever he becomes excessive, whenever he's yelling too loudly, right?
1073000	1078000	That comes directly out of his failure to fully integrate himself and his personality.
1078000	1085000	There's a real psychopathology going on that forced Nietzsche to force the issue.
1085000	1097000	But we're going to continue a little further with this seminar, because after this, the discussion turns to the use of Christian language and symbolism within thus books Zarathustra.
1097000	1111000	And Jung levies the charge that we've considered already, the use of Christian language and symbolism was necessary for Nietzsche precisely because of what Nietzsche felt he had lost in the death of God.
1111000	1124000	Jung brings up that the parallel style to that of the Gospels was a conscious choice, and that therefore Nietzsche on some level knew that he was seeking for what could only be given by religion.
1124000	1128000	What he'd only known before in the language of the Gospels.
1128000	1139000	The conversation is quite extensive in analyzing Nietzsche, but the key point of discussion is that Jung sees Nietzsche as somebody carried away with the power of an archetypal force.
1139000	1148000	Zarathustra is electric, he's full of passion, he's completely overwhelming for Nietzsche, who writes of himself as a kind of instrument at times.
1148000	1157000	Nietzsche sees himself in the way that he writes about in the Zarathustra's prologue, mankind being a bridge and not a goal.
1157000	1160000	Nietzsche himself is a bridge and not a goal.
1160000	1164000	He himself is stretched between animal and overman.
1164000	1170000	He sees his job as bringing forward something that will bear fruit in the far off future.
1170000	1173000	In the present, all we can do is sacrifice to it.
1173000	1185000	For Jung, these very ideas are tell-tale signs of inflation, that the personality is becoming dominated by a complex to which everything is being sacrificed.
1185000	1190000	And so the result is that Nietzsche, in his actual life, becomes a solitary, lonely figure.
1190000	1194000	His real life suffers because of his philosophy.
1194000	1203000	He's alienated from all around him, from his family, his religion, eventually from his friends, from the Wagner's, from his fellow academics.
1203000	1210000	And he writes a philosophy which sets itself at odds with, quote, the herd, right?
1210000	1218000	So why would Nietzsche so strongly set himself as the individual in this eternal struggle against the collective?
1218000	1225000	Back to the seminar, and this is the part that contains the strange folktale that I referenced earlier.
1225000	1229000	But they begin by analyzing one of the first scenes from the Spokes' Arthustra.
1229000	1232000	So we'll get back to the folktale a bit.
1232000	1236000	Back to the seminar, quote, Dr. Jung.
1236000	1239000	Yes, he is no longer in touch with the world.
1239000	1245000	And that Christianity has left the world is exactly the reason why Zarathustra is born again.
1245000	1250000	He must come back because the spirit he created and left behind him has evaporated.
1250000	1256000	You see, that is a repetition of the very important psychological fact that when Christ died,
1256000	1264000	he left behind him, or promised, according to the dogma, the paraclete, the comforter, which is the spirit,
1264000	1270000	like the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost, that is the aftermath of the Christian revelation,
1270000	1273000	the spirit left by the appearance of Christ on earth.
1273000	1278000	His appearance was like a bursting shell that leaves the spirit trailing after.
1278000	1284000	It remains for a while and then slowly recedes into the background again, end quote.
1284000	1293000	And so Jung then ties the paraclete, one of those names for the Holy Spirit, the comforter, the advisor, or the counselor,
1293000	1299000	to the old man in the forest, the old priest, the old ascetic,
1299000	1304000	that Zarathustra meets in the forest at the very beginning of Zarathustra's prologue.
1304000	1309000	And so Jung then quotes from Nietzsche from the book Zarathustra,
1309000	1314000	quote, Go not to men but stay in the forest. Go rather to the animals.
1314000	1319000	Why not be like me, a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?
1319000	1322000	And what do with the saint in the forest? asked Zarathustra.
1322000	1328000	The saint answered, I make hymns and sing them, and in making hymns I laugh and weep and mumble.
1328000	1331000	Thus do I praise God, end quote.
1331000	1335000	And Dr. Jung then continues in the seminar, quote,
1335000	1344000	While the old anchorite spirit is now receding, he makes a regression having understood that nothing was to be done with these human beings.
1344000	1348000	He becomes quite skeptical and thinks it best to worship his God in nature,
1348000	1355000	to be a bear with bears and a bird with birds, to imitate the animal voices again, to sing as a bird would sing.
1355000	1362000	So he is isolated in his wood, a sort of penchant paraclete, ompinchon at least.
1362000	1367000	The new spirit is now a Christ, therefore the analogy of Zarathustra with Christ.
1367000	1373000	He comes down from the mountains with new hopes, new expectations, and a new message to man,
1373000	1379000	and he passes the old fellow, and the new message which the old man does not know of is that God is dead.
1379000	1384000	You see to the anchorite God is active, he still believes that there is a God outside of him,
1384000	1388000	but Zarathustra is convinced that there is no God outside of him.
1388000	1390000	God is dead.
1390000	1396000	Mrs. Bauman, it corresponds with the death of Pan 2000 years ago.
1396000	1399000	Dr. Jung, exactly.
1399000	1403000	One reads in old Latin literature that 2000 years ago,
1403000	1408000	the captain of a boat sailing from the Grecian Islands to Ostia, the harbor of Rome,
1408000	1412000	demanded an immediate interview with the emperor in order to report
1412000	1417000	a most remarkable event which had taken place when he was sailing through the archipelago.
1417000	1422000	He had passed in the night an island where there was an extraordinary noise.
1422000	1426000	He heard people shouting, Pan Magistos Ethnican.
1426000	1428000	Pan the greatest is dead.
1428000	1431000	Pan was the philosophic God of those days.
1431000	1435000	Originally he had been a Latin local God of the fields in the woods,
1435000	1440000	a sort of midday demon with no philosophical or universal importance whatever.
1440000	1446000	Only later, when they learned Greek, did they see that the name of the old Latin God Pan
1446000	1451000	was the same as the Greek word Pan, which means all the universe.
1451000	1454000	So they had new ideas about their old Pan.
1454000	1456000	He became the God of the world.
1456000	1461000	Then about the second century AD, rumors spread that Pan the greatest was dead.
1461000	1463000	Christianity had prevailed against him.
1463000	1467000	The last conception of a nature God created by antiquity.
1467000	1470000	And when the God is dead, it means the end of an epoch.
1470000	1473000	Therefore the great emphasis laid upon that story.
1473000	1478000	In this chapter then we have watched the way in which the spirit of a whole historical epoch recedes,
1478000	1484000	disappears into nature and how at the same time it is renewed in a new figure with a new message.
1484000	1490000	Yet it is still the same old figure, the same spirit that taught mankind the difference between good and evil
1490000	1495000	is now informing us of the fact that there is no difference and that God is dead.
1498000	1501000	I think that's a powerful critique that Jung makes.
1501000	1507000	That God is dead, yes, because the death of God is a recurring event.
1507000	1512000	And in a way, by pointing to the ever recurring nature of this event,
1512000	1517000	Jung is approaching Nietzsche's own proclamation in a very Nietzschean way.
1517000	1522000	That's, even if we grant that this is a European event, a grand historical event,
1522000	1528000	of the belief in the Christian God becoming something unworthy of belief, this is nothing new.
1528000	1533000	No more than when Nietzsche laments the fall of the tragic worldview,
1533000	1539000	the death of that old empire of the mind governed by Apollo and Dionysus
1539000	1543000	and the harsh tragedies and the life-affirming Olympians.
1544000	1548000	That was the world that is last presided over by Pan,
1548000	1555000	the world of the Antica Morale, where the forces of nature were perceived as autonomous gods.
1555000	1560000	Pan was simply yet another divinity laid in the grave.
1560000	1565000	And for Jung, he tied this belief to the astrological ages.
1565000	1569000	The notion that Christianity was the age of Pisces, the two fish,
1569000	1576000	this is the age in which God comes to reconcile with his wayward children, mankind.
1576000	1581000	You know, the fish is the symbol of Jesus Christ, dating from the period of the early Christians.
1581000	1587000	Before Christianity, however, the Greco-Roman period was the age of Aries, the ram.
1587000	1597000	This is a war-like age, an age governed by divinities that have the horns of sheep and goats and rams.
1597000	1602000	And Aries quite literally is the name of one of the Greek gods, and he's a war god.
1602000	1607000	But even before this, there's the age of Taurus, the bull.
1607000	1612000	And what deities do we see as characteristic of the period of the early Bronze Age?
1612000	1617000	Well, figures such as Inanna, Ishtar, Astarte, the bull of heaven,
1617000	1620000	the pastoralist beginnings of civilization,
1620000	1626000	sort of governed by the imagery of cows and bulls, and fertility goddesses.
1626000	1634000	We can set aside whatever metaphysical importance that someone might think to attribute to the turnings of the astrological epochs.
1634000	1642000	But we might simply note on a more basic level, lots of gods and deities have come into being in the human psyche,
1642000	1648000	and then fallen out of worship, and that these images of God all have their time,
1648000	1652000	but then recede into the background of consciousness.
1652000	1659000	Those are the long list of deities that atheists will cite as the gods that every modern theist is an atheist in regard to.
1659000	1661000	That's a common argument.
1661000	1665000	But for Jung, that's no great argument for atheism.
1665000	1670000	He would argue, yes, and yet the gods always return, don't they?
1670000	1676000	The fact that there have been so many religions that people have been atheistic towards
1676000	1681000	might score you some debate points against an individual religion,
1681000	1687000	but it actually goes pretty far towards establishing the value of religion as such,
1687000	1691000	or at least that human being seemed condemned to this way of thinking,
1691000	1698000	and that pointing to the fact that we are all becoming atheists in regard to the latest deity
1698000	1705000	is not at all indicative that we are about to enter an age of atheism as such.
1705000	1710000	You can look at the deaths of all these past divine images in those two very different ways,
1710000	1715000	that either the divine is always dying or the divine is always being resurrected.
1715000	1720000	And we cannot help but notice the central religious motif of Christianity,
1720000	1727000	and indeed many world religions before Christianity, is that of death and resurrection.
1727000	1737000	Perhaps no religion other than Christianity is better suited to take on the idea of their own God dying and then resurrecting.
1737000	1743000	It's based on the faith that their God came to earth, died, and then lived again.
1743000	1749000	And so, in a sense, we can see Nietzsche's proclamation of the death of the Christian God
1749000	1757000	as a mirror image to those shrieks that were heard from that mysterious island 2,000 years ago.
1757000	1759000	That pan is dead.
1759000	1763000	But this, of course, raises a serious question.
1763000	1768000	Considering that Nietzsche sought to revitalize the spirit of the Greek morality,
1768000	1773000	then it ought to be possible to revitalize the spirit of the Christian morality.
1773000	1777000	If the Christian God ever lived, it's because Pan is dead.
1777000	1782000	And if Nietzsche thinks that Pan can live again, then certainly so could Jesus Christ.
1782000	1786000	Nietzsche's insistence on the finality of the Christian God's death,
1786000	1793000	but his implicit desire to see Pan live again, is a huge contradiction in his approach to these ideas.
1793000	1799000	But perhaps the more insightful observation, in my opinion,
1799000	1804000	aside from any specific criticism of Nietzsche's ideas that Jung may be making,
1804000	1807000	there's a rather straightforward underlying truth.
1807000	1813000	In the unconscious, God, religion, all the symbolism and sentiments of religion,
1813000	1815000	these remain.
1815000	1822000	Humanity, European or otherwise, has not even come close to moving on from these religious symbols,
1822000	1824000	this entire religious way of thinking.
1824000	1830000	Even Nietzsche himself, living in the darkness after God's assassination,
1830000	1834000	finds a kind of psychopomp in his characters Arthustra.
1834000	1838000	He is the wise old man, the prophet of the ancient world,
1838000	1845000	and what he comes to teach mankind are actually truths that mankind has already known since time immemorial.
1845000	1850000	Arthustra teaches that this self is something larger than the ego.
1850000	1856000	He teaches that good and evil are relative and interdependent,
1856000	1866000	that one must be reconciled to even embrace their fate with an eye toward the eternality of their destiny.
1866000	1871000	These kinds of assertions have been the stuff of religious talk for thousands of years.
1871000	1875000	Arthustra is a figure that comes from Nietzsche's unconscious,
1875000	1878000	returning him to the most religious of language and metaphor,
1878000	1882000	and drawing him inexorably into the world of myth and religion.
1882000	1890000	And so Jung's great rebuke to Nietzsche is that his fundamental assertion is that a return to the mythic
1890000	1899000	is precisely what we need as the curative of the excessive materialization and mechanization of reality.
1899000	1909000	Even patients who are undergoing a completely secular form of self-transformation speak in such religious language about the experience.
1909000	1913000	Jung argues that people use the language of,
1913000	1918000	I return to myself, I could accept myself, I was reconciled to myself,
1918000	1924000	and he says this is what we used to say by expressing I have made my peace with God,
1924000	1931000	I've submitted myself to the will of God, I've surrendered my will to the plan of God, and so on and so forth.
1931000	1937000	And so Jung sees the key application of religious thought primarily in the realm of psychology.
1937000	1943000	He sees how religion is the central anchoring structure reigning over the psyche.
1943000	1949000	One might suggest that it's quite possibly an innovation that we now speak of the self and not God,
1949000	1953000	in terms of all the statements that Jung reports his patients making.
1953000	1957000	But Jung would say that's a distinction without a difference,
1957000	1963000	that unconsciously the ideal complete self that we seek is identical to the idea of God,
1963000	1967000	and that in both cases we would be describing the same thing,
1967000	1972000	and that we just can't, we have to acknowledge that fundamental truth,
1972000	1977000	that religion seems to be an orienting force for the mind.
1977000	1984000	It seems to have that psychological function, that seems to be the value of religion is psychological.
1984000	1988000	But in spite of this need for a sort of religious order,
1988000	1993000	a kind of understanding of our place of existence, the meaning and purpose of existence,
1993000	1997000	which has always been the North Star of the human mind,
1997000	2003000	we have, through excessive scientism, now thought that such things can be done away with,
2003000	2009000	and for Jung the proof that this is a bad idea is Nietzsche himself.
2009000	2014000	This is the man who went so far beyond the Christian metaphysics and morality,
2014000	2018000	and yet was not by his inclination a positivist or an atheist.
2018000	2024000	Jung says straight out, Nietzsche completely accepted the death of God
2024000	2029000	and tried to see what we should do beyond that, but he himself was no atheist.
2029000	2033000	Nietzsche feels the de-spiritualization of the world very strongly,
2033000	2037000	and he experiences its effects before anyone else.
2037000	2043000	The atheists in Nietzsche's own time are quite literally like the atheists in the marketplace
2043000	2046000	when the madman makes his declaration.
2046000	2051000	They've become unaware of their religious framework by which the human mind is organized.
2051000	2054000	They don't believe themselves to be susceptible to it.
2054000	2058000	They think that their thought exists beyond it.
2058000	2063000	Jung believes that the demystification of the world occurred gradually,
2063000	2066000	and initially it was for quite a worthy purpose.
2066000	2070000	The sciences are a worthy endeavor because the gaps of human knowledge
2070000	2076000	are always filled with projection, and such a world is a chaotic world
2076000	2080000	when your world becomes ruled by projection, so to speak,
2080000	2082000	when you're in a world you don't understand.
2082000	2086000	Science has been our way of taming the world in that way.
2086000	2092000	Science has become the new expression of the pre-existent order behind the chaos of life.
2092000	2099000	Nietzsche himself was rather insightful to give this scientism its own wise old man,
2099000	2102000	its own magician, who is Socrates.
2102000	2107000	The death of Socrates is another repeated motif in Nietzsche's writing,
2107000	2111000	which is particularly interesting in light of Jungian analysis.
2111000	2116000	Socrates is the wise old king who represents the positivist worldview.
2116000	2123000	In many ways, he has as much of a modern problem for Nietzsche as he is an ancient Greek problem.
2123000	2128000	He inevitably must drink his poison as a form of martyrdom for the truth.
2128000	2133000	Scientism is a kind of eternal religious project,
2133000	2137000	but one which never manages to become the final state of the soul
2137000	2141000	because when you totalize the value of scientism, it is deadly.
2141000	2147000	So Jung in his essay, Psychology and Religion, writes the following,
2147000	2152000	Consciousness can hardly exist in a state of complete projection.
2152000	2154000	At most, it would be a heap of emotions.
2154000	2159000	Through the withdrawal of projections, conscious knowledge slowly developed.
2159000	2164000	Science, curiously enough, began with the discovery of astronomical laws
2164000	2168000	and hence with the withdrawal, so to speak, of the most distant projections.
2168000	2173000	This was the first stage in the de-spiritualization of the world.
2173000	2175000	One step followed another.
2175000	2181000	Already in antiquity the gods were withdrawn from mountains and rivers, from trees and animals.
2181000	2186000	Modern science has subtleized its projections to an almost unrecognizable degree,
2186000	2189000	but our ordinary life swarms with them.
2189000	2196000	You can find them spread out in the newspapers, in books, rumors, and ordinary social gossip.
2196000	2201000	All gaps in our actual knowledge are still filled with projections.
2201000	2205000	End quote and further down Jung continues, quote,
2205000	2209000	The materialistic error was probably unavoidable at first,
2209000	2213000	since the throne of God cannot be discovered among the galactical systems,
2213000	2216000	the inference was that God never existed.
2216000	2219000	The second unavoidable error is Psychologism.
2219000	2223000	If God is anything, he must be an illusion derived from certain motives,
2223000	2228000	from will to power, for instance, or from repressed sexuality.
2228000	2230000	These arguments are not new.
2230000	2236000	Much the same thing was said by the Christian missionaries who overthrew the idols of heathen gods.
2236000	2242000	But whereas the early missionaries were conscious of serving a new God by combating the old ones,
2242000	2249000	modern iconoclasts are unconscious of the one in whose name they are destroying old values.
2249000	2251000	End quote.
2251000	2257000	So we should take note Jung brings up two of his predecessors in this passage, but not by name.
2257000	2262000	Nietzsche and Freud, men who say that God is an illusion derived from certain motives.
2262000	2266000	One could read Nietzsche's on the old and new tablets and thus spoke Zarathustra,
2266000	2269000	which I'm almost certain is what Jung is thinking of here,
2269000	2274000	especially given that he references the smashing of old tablets a bit further in the paragraph,
2274000	2276000	which we'll get to in a moment.
2276000	2283000	But importantly in that passage, Zarathustra tells us every people has had its sacred values,
2283000	2288000	all of which have been different and all of which have actually expressed the will to power of a people.
2288000	2293000	He says that they defined their sacred values by differentiating themselves from their neighbors,
2293000	2298000	seeking an altogether different form of the good than their neighbor sought for.
2298000	2305000	That the many different gods therefore are imagistic expressions of a particular way of expressing power.
2305000	2310000	And that therefore the idols of man don't refer to anything metaphysical,
2310000	2314000	but are simply the representation of a psychological need.
2314000	2318000	Freud's explanation is that we believe in God because of in so many words,
2318000	2322000	terror management theory from my own understanding.
2322000	2327000	Freud basically thought that the root of God belief was prior to anything rational.
2327000	2331000	It's simply a way of dealing with an indifferent, uncaring existence.
2331000	2335000	Nevertheless, Freud had quite a bit to say about God the Father
2335000	2341000	and so far as God in the way that God is portrayed in our sort of cultural images
2341000	2346000	the wise old man with the beard, that is somewhat indicative of an infantile regression
2346000	2350000	to a state where one wants to be cared for by daddy.
2350000	2357000	So here, as with everything in Freud, there's an influence of one's psychosexual family dynamics
2357000	2362000	that continually recreates the image of God the Father.
2362000	2367000	In the words of Christopher Hitchens, quote, Nietzsche said God is dead,
2367000	2371000	Freud said God is dead, end quote.
2371000	2375000	I've been waiting to quote that one for probably the whole podcast.
2375000	2377000	But Jung calls this an error.
2377000	2382000	He calls it psychologism to reduce everything down to being merely psychology.
2382000	2385000	That's not Jung's task. Jung's task is the opposite,
2385000	2393000	not to regard psychological phenomena as merely or simply or just.
2393000	2398000	Whenever we insert those sorts of words, we're saying it's insignificant.
2398000	2405000	Rather, Jung's task is to understand psychological phenomena as being as significant as our myths,
2405000	2414000	as significant as our religious ideas, to see some common essence to the disciplines of religion and psychology.
2414000	2420000	So his criticism of both Freud and Nietzsche here as iconoclasts
2420000	2425000	is that they do not know or are not conscious of the new gods that they are serving
2425000	2428000	as they bring forth this anti-Christian age.
2428000	2432000	Nietzsche might think I'm restoring Greek values, but is that what Nietzsche actually did?
2432000	2434000	Is that what he's actually doing?
2434000	2438000	Have we seen that effect in the collective psyche as a result of Nietzsche's work?
2438000	2440000	Have Greek values been restored?
2440000	2444000	So Jung continues, quote,
2444000	2450000	Nietzsche thought himself quite conscious and responsible when he smashed the old tablets,
2450000	2457000	yet he felt a peculiar need to back himself up with a revivified Zerothustra, a sort of alter ego
2457000	2463000	with whom he often identifies himself in his great tragedy of the Spokes Zerothustra.
2463000	2466000	Nietzsche was no atheist, but his god was dead.
2466000	2469000	The result of this demise was a split in himself,
2470000	2475000	to call the other self Zerothustra, or at times Dionysus.
2475000	2481000	In his fatal illness, he signed his letters Zegreus, the dismembered god of the Thracians.
2481000	2486000	The tragedy of Zerothustra is that because his god died, Nietzsche himself became a god,
2486000	2489000	and this happened because he was no atheist.
2489000	2495000	He was of too positive a nature to tolerate the urban neurosis of atheism.
2495000	2498000	It seems dangerous for such a man to assert that god is dead.
2498000	2501000	He instantly becomes the victim of inflation.
2501000	2508000	Far from being a negation, god is actually the strongest and most effective position the psyche can reach,
2508000	2515000	in exactly the same sense in which Paul speaks of the people whose god is in their belly, end quote.
2515000	2521000	So, you know, this is why I love Jung's criticism of Nietzsche, perhaps most of all.
2521000	2524000	You can poke all sorts of logical holes in it,
2524000	2530000	and accuse Jung of stating things with certainty that are basically just speculation, and that would be true.
2530000	2539000	But Nietzsche philosophized and made critiques, and stated his own speculations with certainty in sort of the same way.
2539000	2542000	So, how can we really defend Nietzsche on that basis?
2542000	2544000	Like, you're not making the most rigorous argument.
2544000	2552000	I mean, go look at a lot of the way Nietzsche attacks and polemicizes against past philosophical figures by psychoanalyzing them.
2552000	2559000	And Jung is mostly taking the same mode of attack here, so it's kind of hard, you know, turn about his fair play, is what I'm trying to say.
2559000	2567000	But what I love about Jung's comments here is that he's complimenting Nietzsche in the highest terms, and also basically calling him crazy.
2567000	2573000	That Nietzsche is not like the simple-minded variety of atheists that came after him.
2573000	2578000	It really, he's not an atheist at all, not by temperament, and not in practice,
2578000	2586000	as he is forced by a God inhabiting him to construct a new religion, to author in a new religious language.
2586000	2592000	And this new God, he feels to be something he himself created.
2592000	2598000	And that's, in some sense, the source of the inflation, the idea that a God is inside of him.
2598000	2602000	He feels himself to be more of a prophet than a philosopher,
2602000	2607000	the man who must make the most serious demands that have ever been made of mankind.
2607000	2610000	It's the way he classifies his project in Achehomo.
2610000	2616000	God actually is in Nietzsche's belly, both in the sense that he carries the spirit of Zarathustra,
2616000	2625000	and that he relocates the pre-rational intelligence governing our very being to the physiology quite literally to the belly, right?
2625000	2632000	Think about all the comments Nietzsche says about the importance of diet in terms of what your ideas are going to be.
2632000	2636000	But as Jung points out here, Nietzsche himself feels torn.
2636000	2642000	He signs his letters as Dionysus, or as Agraeus, who is Dionysus in his dismembered form.
2642000	2652000	It's surprising that Jung doesn't mention in this passage that Nietzsche signed his letters as the crucified, although I think Jung mentions it elsewhere.
2652000	2660000	But it indicates that even for Nietzsche, the pole of that opposite moral orientation that other archetype still exists,
2660000	2670000	that Nietzsche felt himself not wholly Dionysian, but divided between the two, which is a similar critique that Gerard makes.
2670000	2678000	What the Christian represents to Jung is far more than Nietzsche's conception of the Christian.
2678000	2682000	To Nietzsche Christianity is first and foremost a moral framework.
2682000	2687000	It's a system of reacting against the powerful, driven by an inborn pity.
2687000	2694000	It's fueled by resentment, and it deals with resentment by creating the bad conscience within the individual.
2694000	2704000	Its existence therefore becomes a delivery system for pity, which results ultimately in a mankind which lives in a state of guilt.
2704000	2711000	For Jung, Christianity has to be understood as a religion centered around the life of Christ.
2711000	2715000	Christ, like Dionysus, or Zarathustra, is an archetype.
2715000	2720000	We could say that Christ is the most powerful archetype in all of human history, even.
2720000	2728000	And just as we might consciously disavow the religious, while our unconscious goes right along thinking in religious terms,
2728000	2733000	we can consciously criticize the Christian moral feeling, as Nietzsche did.
2733000	2741000	But all the while still find our thoughts and actions motivated or affected by the imagery and the narrative,
2741000	2746000	the pre-rational sensibility that Christianity represents.
2746000	2750000	Jung writes in Psychology and Religion, quote,
2751000	2760000	The life of Christ is no exception in that not a few of the great figures of history have realized more or less clearly the archetype of the hero's life,
2760000	2763000	with its characteristic changes of fortune.
2763000	2769000	But the ordinary man too unconsciously lives archetypal forms, and if these are no longer valued,
2769000	2772000	it is only because of the prevailing psychological ignorance.
2772000	2778000	Indeed, even the fleeting phenomena of dreams often reveal distinctly archetypal patterns.
2778000	2784000	At bottom, all psychic events are so deeply grounded in the archetype and are so much interwoven with it
2784000	2791000	that in every case, considerable critical effort is needed to separate the unique from the typical with any certainty.
2791000	2797000	Ultimately, every individual is continuously historical because strictly time bound.
2797000	2801000	The relation of the type to time, on the other hand, is irrelevant.
2801000	2808000	Since the life of Christ is archetypal to a high degree, it represents to just that degree the life of the archetype.
2808000	2812000	But since the archetype is the unconscious precondition of every human life,
2812000	2818000	its life, when revealed, also reveals the hidden unconscious ground life of every individual.
2818000	2823000	That is to say what happens in the life of Christ happens always and everywhere.
2823000	2830000	In the Christian archetype, all lives of this kind are prefigured and are expressed over and over again, or once and for all.
2830000	2836000	And in it too, the question that concerns us here of God's death is anticipated in perfect form.
2836000	2841000	Christ himself is the typical dying and self-transforming God.
2841000	2845000	The psychological situation from which we started is tantamount to,
2845000	2849000	Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here.
2849000	2851000	Luke 24-5.
2851000	2854000	But where shall we find the risen Christ?
2854000	2856000	End quote.
2857000	2862000	So another striking disagreement between Nietzsche and Jung.
2862000	2865000	Jung calls Jesus the perfected archetype of the hero.
2865000	2872000	Nietzsche completely disagrees with this, and he mentions in his book The Antichrist,
2872000	2880000	that much of his comments against Jesus as the heroic figure are a polemic against Renan's view of Jesus,
2880000	2886000	who was also put forward the notion that Jesus perfects the heroic type.
2886000	2890000	Nietzsche thinks there's no one further from a hero than Jesus of Nazareth.
2890000	2893000	And we could say that this position comes out of Nietzsche's perception,
2893000	2898000	that there are two different competing types of aristocracy in human society.
2898000	2903000	Two centers of power that emerged since ancient days.
2903000	2907000	Warrior aristocracies and the priestly castes.
2907000	2913000	The aristocracies attain the ability to create values by fighting for worldly power.
2913000	2917000	The priestly castes create values via the ascetic ideal,
2917000	2923000	which essentially involves not fighting, not struggling to attain worldly power,
2923000	2925000	eschewing worldly power.
2925000	2933000	Nietzsche sees an essential difference here and sees Jesus as sort of like an ultimate ascetic.
2933000	2938000	It can't even be classed among the heroes such as Gilgamesh or Hercules.
2938000	2942000	Those are symbols of vital fighting, struggling life.
2942000	2946000	Jesus is defined by not struggling against the powers that be.
2946000	2949000	He gives no worldly resistance at all.
2949000	2953000	He teaches his followers to turn the other cheek, resist not evil.
2953000	2959000	Nietzsche says those three words, resist not evil, are the key to the entire gospel.
2959000	2961000	Jung sees things differently.
2961000	2969000	Precisely insofar as the archetype itself of the self-sacrificing individual speaking truth to power
2969000	2971000	is a form of struggle.
2971000	2977000	The way of life of Jesus, the image of life that Jesus gives us,
2977000	2982000	it's a form that recognizes that it is not by worldly competition,
2982000	2986000	by strife or violence, in the manner that Cain killed Abel,
2986000	2989000	that power itself can be opposed.
2989000	2995000	The most famous example of what we might call Christian heroism,
2995000	2999000	overcoming the old morality, the antiche moral,
2999000	3002000	is the story of the last gladiatorial games.
3002000	3005000	Two gladiators are about to do battle in the arena.
3005000	3010000	A Christian walks down into the arena, tells them to stop in the name of Christ.
3010000	3015000	They killed him, but the audience walks out in protest.
3015000	3019000	It's the end of this spectacle of public collective violence.
3019000	3023000	Through martyrdom, through a loving, sincere, nonviolent will,
3023000	3027000	one can put themselves into opposition with power itself
3027000	3034000	and be a more effective threat to it than all of the violent revolutionaries that have ever existed throughout history.
3034000	3040000	Because violent revolution only ever creates more violence, a harsher crackdown.
3040000	3044000	Whenever it succeeds, it almost always becomes the tyranny it opposed
3044000	3050000	and whenever it fails, it only ever brings about a harsher response from the powers that be.
3050000	3054000	So it seems that the only way to actually oppose the corruption of power
3054000	3060000	is not to resist it in physical terms, but to resist it spiritually, to condemn it morally.
3060000	3065000	And so for Jung, the life of Christ is a heroic life.
3065000	3069000	This is a man who lives by his principles and suffers supremely for it.
3069000	3074000	But he does so as a personal sacrifice for the greater good of mankind.
3074000	3077000	What is that if not heroic?
3077000	3084000	The heroic archetype and the language of all religions and cultures is related to the symbol of the self.
3084000	3087000	The hero is the protagonist, so to speak.
3087000	3092000	Jung writes in the chapter of Aion, Christ, a symbol of the self,
3092000	3099000	quote, Christ is our nearest analogy of the self and its meaning, end quote.
3099000	3106000	This cross-cultural idea of a heroic self is always found in relation to the savior archetype,
3106000	3108000	or the redeemer, as Jung calls it.
3108000	3116000	It's a timeless experience that in a period of chaos in which God seems to have vanished,
3116000	3120000	it's at that moment that we begin to search for the savior.
3120000	3128000	And in terms of personal psychological development, this is exemplified in the practice of giving oneself over to a higher power,
3128000	3131000	as an effective means of personal transformation.
3131000	3138000	Christ, as the hero who is born, lives, and dies as God on earth,
3138000	3145000	it's a God image and ideal that man can and will hold on to whenever God seems to be absent.
3145000	3149000	It's the message that the savior will always return.
3149000	3155000	And since his life is so archetypal and thus eternal and universal,
3155000	3160000	we can find endless inspiration and comfort in the example of the life of Christ.
3160000	3165000	Further, in the essay Psychology and Religion, Jung continues, quote,
3165000	3169000	The death or loss must always repeat itself.
3169000	3172000	Christ always dies and always he is born.
3172000	3178000	For the psychic life of the archetype is timeless in comparison with our individual time-boundness.
3178000	3185000	According to what laws now one and now another aspect of the archetype enters into active manifestations, I do not know.
3185000	3190000	I only know, and here I am expressing, what countless other people know,
3190000	3195000	that the present is a time of God's death and disappearance.
3195000	3199000	The myth says that he was not to be found where his body was laid.
3199000	3206000	Body means the outward visible form, the erstwhile but ephemeral setting for the highest value.
3206000	3212000	The myth further says that the value rose again in a miraculous manner, transformed.
3212000	3214000	It appears as a miracle.
3214000	3219000	For when a value disappears, it always seems to be lost irretrievably.
3219000	3222000	So it is quite unexpected that it should come back.
3222000	3229000	The three days descent into hell during death describes the sinking of the vanished value into the unconscious,
3229000	3235000	whereby conquering the power of darkness it establishes a new order and then rises up to heaven again.
3235000	3239000	That is, attains supreme clarity of consciousness.
3239000	3249000	The fact that only a few people see the risen one means that no small difficulties stand in the way of finding and recognizing the transformed value.
3249000	3251000	End quote.
3251000	3258000	From this, it may be difficult to say exactly what Jung really believes about Jesus Christ.
3258000	3262000	Was he a literal God on earth who physically resurrected?
3262000	3271000	Or is it just that the psychological truth of the story is so powerful and so eternally real to us for all intents and purposes?
3271000	3277000	Such questions of the material reality of the story cannot be taken seriously.
3277000	3281000	And you could say that this kind of confusion, what do you really believe about this story,
3281000	3291000	applies to some prominent Jungians in the light of the public eye today.
3291000	3299000	It's real for us psychologically, and so such questions of the material reality of the resurrection are merely academic.
3299000	3302000	That might be the Jungian response.
3303000	3307000	I understand it. I think for me personally it's a bit unsatisfying.
3307000	3316000	But all the same, there are moments in this passage where it seems as though Christ is being used as a metaphor for personal development.
3316000	3321000	And I'm sure that Dr. Jung would insist that, sure, it is a metaphor.
3321000	3323000	It's not just a metaphor, right?
3323000	3326000	That we really need to get over that kind of productive thinking.
3326000	3329000	And I'd agree with him to some extent there too.
3329000	3334000	But I suppose that I've never been satisfied by such reasoning.
3334000	3340000	To put my issues with it into words that might be commensurate with Jung's own thought,
3340000	3349000	if the sciences have de-spiritualized the world to the point that people no longer consciously accept mythic explanations,
3349000	3353000	then shouldn't we have to reconcile ourselves to this reality
3353000	3358000	rather than attempting to reconcile our conscious sober understanding of reality?
3358000	3361000	The one that's banished all those projections, right?
3361000	3363000	That Jung says is just chaos.
3363000	3368000	Now that we're living in a more conscious sober understanding,
3368000	3374000	should we reconcile that reality to the world of dreams and schizophrenic visions?
3374000	3380000	Or should we reconcile the world of dreams and schizophrenic visions to the more sober view of life?
3380000	3386000	The fact that we habitually think in certain terms does not preclude the possibility that these are still incorrect terms.
3386000	3390000	And I would say that's one of the main great critiques of Nietzsche, right?
3390000	3395000	That we have these thought habits that are ultimately erroneous.
3395000	3398000	And even if we can't escape certain pitfalls of thought,
3398000	3404000	does that mean we should make a decision to become irrational to forget what we've learned?
3404000	3411000	Or do we say perhaps I will begin to measure the strength of my soul by how much truth I can tolerate?
3411000	3413000	That's all an open question.
3413000	3421000	Perhaps Dr. Jung could point out the ways in which someone like myself has gone along with the fantastical views of a man like Nietzsche,
3421000	3427000	who was undoubtedly driven by a kind of prophetic inspiration,
3427000	3433000	and that therefore, even my own way of life is proof, we all must choose our religion,
3433000	3439000	and to follow in the footsteps of Nietzsche is no less another choice of religious affiliation.
3439000	3448000	And as a consequence of Nietzsche's inflation with that Zarathustrian archetype by becoming Zarathustra's prophet,
3448000	3455000	and Nietzsche's attempt to force certain anti-Christian sentiments or strange moral ideas into existence
3455000	3458000	that Jung thinks even he couldn't fully believe,
3458000	3466000	Jung alleges in an infamous section of memories, dreams, and reflections that Nietzsche fell into unreality.
3466000	3468000	quote
3468000	3473000	Nietzsche had lost the ground under his feet because he possessed nothing more than the inner world of his thoughts,
3473000	3477000	which incidentally possessed him more than he it.
3477000	3484000	He was uprooted and hovered above the earth, and therefore he succumbed to exaggeration and irreality.
3484000	3488000	For me, such irreality was the quintessence of horror,
3488000	3492000	for I aimed, after all, at this world and this life.
3492000	3495000	end quote
3495000	3501000	You know, it's the brilliant thing about Jung's critiques because the precise thing Nietzsche would say
3501000	3504000	is that they aim at this world and this life.
3504000	3509000	The affirmation of this world and this life is the very thing that Nietzsche said as his goal.
3509000	3513000	But a Jungian would counter, is that what his philosophy actually resulted in?
3513000	3517000	What was the actual operative process going on in Nietzsche's thought?
3517000	3523000	Was it actually being grounded in the material reality around him?
3523000	3525000	Jung would say no.
3525000	3529000	For one, Nietzsche did not live up to that very ideal that he set for himself.
3529000	3530000	Why not?
3530000	3536000	Well, by the very fact that he set himself against the entire modern world,
3536000	3541000	Nietzsche is keen to understand our existence as an indelibly human existence,
3541000	3547000	and yet he thinks that the human psyche, as it is, is fundamentally sick and deluded.
3547000	3550000	He smashes the tablets of old.
3550000	3554000	He engages in that iconoclasm for which Jung criticizes him.
3554000	3560000	He tries to destroy all that, which we formerly regarded as real.
3560000	3566000	But he does so while being driven by forces that he admits he doesn't fully understand.
3566000	3570000	And he knows that he's showing signs of incipient madness.
3570000	3576000	So I think there is at least something to Jung's critique here of Nietzsche.
3576000	3580000	There's a passage in volume 7 of Jung's collected works that clarifies this.
3580000	3583000	This is on page 37.
3583000	3589000	We must look very critically at the life of one who taught such a yeh saying
3589000	3594000	in order to examine the views of this teaching on the teacher's own life.
3594000	3600000	When we scrutinize his life with this aim and view, we are bound to admit that Nietzsche lived beyond instinct
3600000	3603000	and the lofty heights of heroic sublimity,
3603000	3608000	heights that he could maintain only with the help of the most meticulous diet,
3608000	3614000	a carefully selected climate, and many aids to sleep, until the tension shattered his brain.
3614000	3618000	He talked of yeh saying and lived the nay.
3618000	3623000	His loathing for man, for the human animal that lived by instinct, was too great.
3623000	3627000	Despite everything, he could not swallow the toad he so often dreamed of,
3627000	3630000	and what he feared had to be swallowed.
3630000	3635000	The roaring of the Zarathustrian lion drove back into the cavern of the unconscious
3635000	3638000	all the higher men who were clamoring to live.
3638000	3642000	Hence, his life does not convince us of his teaching.
3642000	3646000	For the higher man wants to be able to sleep without chloral,
3646000	3651000	to live in Nomburg and Basel despite fogs and shadows.
3651000	3656000	He desires wife and offspring, standing in a steam among the herd,
3656000	3661000	innumerable commonplace realities, and not least those of the Philistine.
3661000	3665000	Nietzsche failed to live this instinct, the animal urged to life.
3665000	3671000	For all his greatness and importance, Nietzsche's was a pathological personality.
3671000	3673000	End quote.
3673000	3676000	So as we all know in Nietzsche's biography,
3676000	3681000	as Jung says, he fails to ever find a wife or start a family,
3681000	3684000	which does seem to be something he was interested in,
3684000	3689000	in spite of the ways that he disparaged married philosophers,
3689000	3692000	and at least one passage I can think of,
3692000	3700000	which could come off like sour grapes in that old fable of Aesop.
3700000	3703000	And what happened to Nietzsche?
3703000	3707000	He began to steadily detach from reality itself.
3707000	3711000	His mind began to become consumed by these warring forces,
3711000	3713000	Dionysus versus the Crucified.
3713000	3717000	He eventually has his collapse and becomes an invalid,
3717000	3722000	muttering insane phrases and living in a hazy world of hallucinations.
3722000	3727000	So Nietzsche and Kant accuse a Jungian of not wanting to live in reality,
3727000	3730000	and a Jungian can say, well, Nietzsche didn't live in reality.
3730000	3732000	He quite literally went insane.
3732000	3735000	So was the Nietzschean philosophy really a good approximation of reality,
3735000	3738000	or was his iconoclasm something ill-advised,
3738000	3744000	something which actually did not achieve its aim of destroying the old religious power,
3744000	3746000	it in fact destroyed Nietzsche.
3746000	3750000	And in writing his philosophy, Nietzsche opened the floodgates
3750000	3756000	for all sorts of older, dangerous spiritual forces to take hold.
3756000	3758000	And the Nietzschean might counter that by saying,
3758000	3763000	well, is that a material claim or a metaphor to which the Jungian might say both,
3763000	3765000	and on and on and on.
3765000	3771000	Still, we should keep in mind that Nietzsche was an important influence on Jung,
3771000	3776000	and Nietzsche as a case study was invaluable to Jung.
3776000	3780000	I mean, the very fact that Nietzsche is a case that Jung returns to
3780000	3782000	again and again throughout his work proves this.
3782000	3787000	The case of Nietzsche is perhaps one of the greatest psychological events that has ever happened
3787000	3789000	from a Jungian perspective.
3789000	3795000	How could you be anything but grateful that you have a work like The Spook Zarathustra,
3795000	3803000	which is a living record of archetypal inflation on a scale that has perhaps never been seen before since.
3803000	3807000	Jung was influenced by the Gnostics and by the Alchemists.
3807000	3813000	And while a discussion of Jung's views on alchemy is something I'm certainly going to cover in the future,
3813000	3816000	it would take us way too far afield here,
3816000	3822000	but I just wanted to mention Jung's interest in esotericism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism,
3822000	3827000	alchemy, Theosophy, magic, astrology, divination.
3827000	3834000	The fact that Jung was interested in these things is often added to the list of reasons why Jung is a kook or something like that.
3834000	3839000	But in truth, his method here is quite consistent with his method generally,
3839000	3841000	and it's seen in the way he looks at Nietzsche.
3841000	3844000	He looks at Nietzsche as frankly insane.
3844000	3852000	But what Jung does is he looks to these domains of human thought with the aim of gathering truth about the human mind,
3852000	3857000	which is undoubtedly where all these ideas emerge.
3857000	3859000	It's where they exist, right?
3859000	3864000	Whatever you want to say about an idea, you know it comes from the mind, so it tells you something about the mind.
3864000	3871000	So Jung doesn't start from the position that astrology reveals truths about material physical reality.
3871000	3878000	He starts from the position that astrology is the projection of the contents of our unconscious onto the stars.
3878000	3885000	It comes from the intuition that the turning of celestial bodies is somehow involved with the destiny of mankind
3885000	3891000	in some strange, distant way that's perhaps larger than we can even perceive.
3891000	3897000	And so there's like an intuition that the cycles of life here on Earth are governed by the stars.
3897000	3902000	And that idea when we stated in that very general sense is true, by the way.
3902000	3908000	But that's not why Jung studies it, is not to, you know, to read horoscopes.
3908000	3911000	The work of the alchemists is much the same.
3911000	3918000	The alchemists believed, as above so below, the laws that govern heaven are the laws that govern matter.
3918000	3922000	Whatever apprehends in the domain of spirit ought to apply in the domain of science.
3922000	3931000	And so the magnum opus, the name for the great work of the alchemists, is not simply a charlatan's promise of turning lead into gold.
3931000	3933000	It's something much bigger than that.
3933000	3938000	It's the notion that we could transform one type of substance into another type.
3938000	3946000	That the elements that we perceive in the world are all related to one another as matter, as something physical.
3946000	3954000	And just as the spiritual world, you know, we speak of the language of change and transformation as the main spiritual narrative.
3954000	3965000	Perhaps we can learn the corresponding laws that apprehend here on Earth so that we could use scientific knowledge to affect change or transformation among material forms.
3965000	3973000	That, you know, different types of matter, different forms of matter as we perceive them aren't actually like fundamentally different.
3973000	3982000	That they all have a unity to them as matter and that, you know, and again, that's something that is actually true, right?
3982000	3990000	Maybe you could say they didn't know that empirically or experimentally, but this is the insight of going all the way back to Democritus.
3990000	3996000	Matter is united to other forms of matter as matter and that they all behave by the laws of matter.
3996000	4008000	If they're all made of atoms and these configurations of elementary particles, then yes, we find out in the modern day when we have a particle accelerator that we can actually turn lead into gold, right?
4008000	4013000	The atoms that make up lead and the atoms that make up gold are the same atoms, right?
4013000	4015000	No, they're not actually literally the same atoms.
4015000	4020000	You know what I'm saying. They're all made up of the same subatomic particles.
4020000	4026000	And, you know, alchemy was the basis of chemistry and that's to oversimplify things.
4026000	4031000	You know, in truth, alchemy was practiced concurrently with chemistry for a very long time.
4031000	4045000	This is sort of like an esoteric form of chemistry where a lot of the results are kept secret or preserved in the form of code because they wanted to keep the unwise from learning about these chemical changes and secrets.
4045000	4051000	But, you know, the alchemists did in fact make discoveries that were relevant to early chemistry.
4051000	4053000	They discovered phosphorus.
4053000	4059000	They learned develop techniques that we use to this day and distilling, creating alcohol.
4059000	4065000	The word alcohol comes from alchemy, but that's not Jung's interest.
4065000	4073000	Where he finds his interest in the alchemists is insofar as they write of the esoteric work of self-transformation,
4073000	4080000	where they use the metaphors of the chemical transformations they're able to affect.
4080000	4085000	They find a correspondence there to the world of the spirit, as above so below.
4085000	4091000	So moving from lead to tin to iron to copper to mercury to silver to gold,
4091000	4095000	that's a kind of metaphor for the soul and its own path of transformation.
4095000	4104000	And so the material that the alchemists leave behind, the textual record that we have today of alchemy,
4104000	4110000	has a psychologically relevant dimension because oftentimes they're using the chemical processes they've discovered
4110000	4117000	and mixing it together with religious imagery and symbolism in order to try to convey a metaphor of spiritual development.
4117000	4121000	And Jung is perhaps the first person to perceive this.
4121000	4125000	Alchemy is a psychologically relevant field of study.
4125000	4130000	Furthermore, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, all these esoteric religious movements,
4130000	4134000	these are also psychologically valuable fields of study.
4134000	4142000	What Jung finds so valuable in these traditions, we might say, is that it's an artistic expression of religious thought.
4142000	4151000	In other words, it's written by people who are letting their creative metaphor-making side of the mind run free, so to speak.
4151000	4155000	They're giving voice to the most significant and numinous concepts in their minds,
4155000	4163000	which we might say within traditional dogmatic religion is circumscribed within a set of traditional symbols.
4163000	4171000	You're not really allowed to be creative or you're not supposed to be creative with the symbols and imagery within the tradition of the religion.
4171000	4178000	Jung writes quite a bit about mandalas as a result of this, those eastern symbols of spiritual wholeness.
4178000	4188000	A mandala has a circular shape. It bears resemblance to the kind of paradisaical walled garden that indicates a fully actualized self.
4188000	4198000	Jung's patients would draw mandalas as part of their process of psychological convalescence, sort of spontaneously expressing they were moving toward the state of wholeness.
4198000	4210000	And in the mandalas, drawn by his patients, Jung basically saw it as though their artistic faculties were being used to sort of channel that language of spirituality.
4210000	4214000	And it's the same with an alchemical text or a gnostic text.
4214000	4224000	And then furthermore, Jung finds examples in literature in which a work that might normally be considered secular has a deep religious dimension.
4224000	4233000	And a work we've considered throughout the episode is Zorathustra, but another main source of influence is Goethe's Faust, particularly Faust II.
4233000	4242000	And one of the things that Jung sees in these works of apparently secular fiction is that often they use alchemical imagery or symbolism.
4242000	4251000	Which again, isn't because Jung thinks there's like a secret influence from the alchemists there, although there certainly might be in some cases.
4252000	4259000	But that the thing underlying that use of imagery is, we might say, prior to alchemy and prior to the text.
4259000	4268000	The reason why it resonates with us is because it's something that there is a grain of psychological truth within these gnostic traditions.
4268000	4275000	I'm going to quote now from Paul Bishop's, the Dionysian self, Carl Jung's reception of Friedrich Nietzsche.
4276000	4289000	Jung's study of gnostic literature is also important because together with his own personal experiences, it led him to an entirely new understanding of Goethe's Faust and Nietzsche's Zorathustra.
4289000	4301000	According to his autobiography, Jung concluded that he could resituate both these works within the matrix of the mythopoeic imagination, which in his view had disappeared in the modern age of rationality.
4302000	4316000	Both Faust and Zorathustra could be subsumed in the golden or Homeric chain, the alchemical term for the series of great wise men, starting with Hermes Trismegestus, which links heaven and earth.
4316000	4324000	End quote, and then he quotes from Jung here, quote, the second part of Faust, too, is more than a literary exercise.
4325000	4334000	It is a link in the aria catena, which has existed from the beginnings of philosophical alchemy and gnosticism down to Nietzsche's Zorathustra.
4334000	4342000	Unpopular, ambiguous, and dangerous, it is a voyage of discovery to the other pole of the world.
4342000	4344000	End quote.
4344000	4348000	And so that's the value of Nietzsche as a case study.
4348000	4358000	He presents us with a journey through his own psyche to a pole of reality that is far flung from our normal, everyday conscious experience.
4358000	4367000	Both Goethe and Nietzsche accomplished this because their works consciously or unconsciously drew from the well of religious and alchemical symbolism.
4367000	4377000	Both are engaged with the Aries era religion of Greek antiquity and with the Pisces era religion of European Christendom.
4377000	4387000	And both Goethe and Nietzsche are in their way heralds of a new kind of modern man, a man who has to live in this de-spiritualized reality,
4388000	4398000	who thinks in terms of mechanistic explanations and positivistic empiricism, and yet beneath the surface there's that same archetypal drama.
4398000	4402000	Those archetypes still reach up and take hold of the human heart.
4402000	4407000	They are still the driving sub complexes that determine our fate.
4407000	4413000	In dreams, as in our most desperate moments, we still think in those same terms.
4413000	4421000	Like Faust, when we reach the end of all of our studies of the physical world, all of the knowledge and the art and science of mankind,
4421000	4429000	we sigh aloud and say, quote, and here I am for all my lore, the wretched fool I was before, end quote.
4429000	4436000	And in our heart we wonder, as Faust does, what is that secret force? What is it that hides behind the world?
4437000	4444000	And so Jung reads Faust like a gnostic text, and he reads Zarathustra like a gnostic text.
4444000	4454000	He asks what the psychological relevance is, what is their timeless truth that stands prior to the author's conscious reasons, which are really just post hoc.
4454000	4465000	The conflict that is the main undercurrent of both of these works and the malady that split Nietzsche in half is described by Jung in the essay The Undiscovered Self, quote.
4466000	4472000	Nothing is more characteristic and symptomatic than the gulf that is opened out between faith and knowledge.
4472000	4480000	The rupture between faith and knowledge is a symptom of the split consciousness which is so characteristic of the mental disorder of our day.
4480000	4493000	It is as if two different persons were making statements about the same thing, each from his own point of view, or as if one person in two different frames of mind were sketching a picture of his experience, end quote.
4494000	4500000	The conflict, as it were, is between our conscious and unconscious.
4500000	4505000	Consciously we're guided by knowledge, unconsciously by faith.
4505000	4513000	We ignore the unconscious side because it contains the shadow, among other things, all of that we have tried to suppress about ourselves.
4513000	4520000	The unconscious remains a fearful place, a place from which the individual always tries to look away or flee.
4521000	4527000	And that only means that the unconscious contents will remain ever more dangerous.
4527000	4534000	They're already ready to take hold and subsume the individual in moments of crisis or great social upheaval.
4534000	4542000	Nowadays in the modern age that we've lost our religious lexicon for talking about them, that's why they take on a greater danger.
4542000	4549000	And those political isms, communism, fascism, for example, those are the work of archetypal thoughts.
4549000	4557000	Archetypal feelings, archetypal actions, taking hold of a mass of individuals that have become disintegrated.
4557000	4568000	Jung stresses that there is a real peril here, therefore, in continuing to ignore the unconscious or assuming that we could iconoclastically smash the contents of it.
4568000	4572000	We will always find our destiny is made there and not authored by the ego.
4572000	4576000	And on that respect, Jung and Nietzsche are in agreement.
4577000	4580000	But Jung would argue that Nietzsche was one-sided.
4580000	4587000	He was brilliant, he was deeply in touch with himself, and he wrote some of the most beautiful passages in the history of literature.
4587000	4599000	But nevertheless, he was the victim of archetypal inflation, a one-sided man who followed the will to truth under the harshest, coldest territory that its extremities could offer
4599000	4605000	and found that in that vast cold darkness an archetype was waiting for him.
4605000	4619000	The archetype of the wise old man that returned only more powerfully because Nietzsche had tried to make war upon that very thing, the anchoring meaning behind our society.
4619000	4622000	Jung writes, quote,
4636000	4642000	And therefore he sought a higher human wholeness beyond good and evil.
4642000	4650000	But he who seriously criticizes the basic attitudes of Christianity also forfeits the protection which these bestow upon him.
4650000	4654000	He delivers himself up unresistingly to the animal psyche.
4654000	4664000	That is the moment of Dionysian frenzy, the overwhelming manifestation of the blonde beast, which seizes the unsuspecting soul with nameless shudderings.
4664000	4671000	The seizure transforms him into a hero or into a godlike being, a superhuman entity.
4671000	4677000	He rightly feels himself 6,000 feet beyond good and evil, end quote.
4677000	4687000	Jung's way of approaching other thinkers from this psychoanalytic angle is as powerful an interpretive framework as anything Nietzsche himself gives us.
4687000	4695000	Jung finds that there's much truth in what is hidden, invisible, unsaid, or even unable to be said.
4695000	4705000	And the metaphor that Jung uses for this made it so I couldn't resist quoting him, and I think the Delusians will enjoy this quote that we're going to end on.
4705000	4708000	This is from Memories, Dreams, and Reflections, quote,
4718000	4730000	Thank you for joining me and examining Nietzsche through the Jungian lens.
4730000	4738000	I feel that now that we've introduced Jung into our rogue's gallery of thinkers, I can now include more of Jung as we continue on.
4738000	4743000	And I intend to do that with many of the figures we've discussed so far.
4743000	4758000	I usually try to introduce a new philosopher with the most wholesome possible introduction that is to say an introduction that conveys the whole person, also offering some concrete ideas from specific works,
4758000	4763000	and in a way which is as steel manned as I'm capable of doing.
4763000	4775000	And secondly, because of the topic of the podcast, I feel obligated to explain their relation to Nietzsche as sort of the task number one in bringing up a new figure.
4775000	4786000	And so once we get both of those steps out of the way, I feel that I have more freedom in future episodes to return to that figure without having to constantly tie it back to Nietzsche.
4787000	4798000	And since we've now gotten a lot of Nietzsche's main influences introduced, I've talked about a handful of interpreters, the podcast, I think as we go forward, it's going to continue to shift its focus, so to speak.
4798000	4802000	More and more episodes will be about people who aren't Nietzsche.
4802000	4816000	But personally, I'm looking forward to this, because it's not as if I'm not going to talk about Nietzsche anymore, but there's just so much other great philosophy work out there to talk about, and I like the variety.
4816000	4826000	I hope all of you do as well. I'd expect next season we're going to probably have more episodes than not, which are not Nietzsche-centric, so to speak.
4826000	4838000	But again, this is still the Nietzsche podcast, which means that in our next main episode, we're going to get back into Nietzsche's work, and we're going to continue with that theme of psychological investigation.
4838000	4845000	We're going to consider one of the most important psychological passages in Nietzsche from Twilight of Idols, The Four Great Errors.
4845000	4850000	I've referenced it before. I think it's time to give it a proper episode all to itself.
4850000	4858000	Before we get there, though, I have another conversation coming next week. This one I'm very excited about as well.
4858000	4868000	So hopefully all of you will join me then for a conversation. It's going to be sort of a counterpart to the one I did with Devon Gorey.
4868000	4875000	We're getting political again, but I think it was a great conversation. I think you're going to enjoy it.
4875000	4882000	So tune in next week. By the time this episode's coming out, I'm going to be on tour. I'm going to be on the road.
4882000	4892000	So look me up. See if I'm going to be in your city. If you're not going to be a weirdo, then please come out and come see me.
4892000	4898000	I say that, but I haven't had anywhere. I've had lots of fans of the podcast come out to shows. They've all been great.
4898000	4901000	You just get weirded out saying things like that online.
4901000	4908000	All right, everybody, that's going to be it for this week. Hope you'll join me next time. Cheers, everybody, signing off.
4931000	4934000	Thank you.
