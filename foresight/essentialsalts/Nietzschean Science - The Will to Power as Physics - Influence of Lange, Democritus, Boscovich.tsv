0	9000	I accept the matter of the whole world at the beginning as in a state of general dispersion
9000	12520	and make of it a complete chaos.
12520	19200	I see this matter forming itself in accordance with the established laws of attraction and
19200	22320	modifying its movement by repulsion.
22320	29120	I enjoy the pleasure, without having recourse to arbitrary hypotheses of seeing a well-ordered
29120	35680	whole produced under the regulation of the established laws of motion, and this whole
35680	41560	looks so like that system of the world before our eyes that I cannot refuse to identify
41560	43400	it with it.
43400	50360	I will therefore not deny that the theory of Lucretius, or his predecessors, Epicurus,
50360	56080	Lusapus, and Democritus, has much resemblance with mine.
56080	64040	It seems to me that we can hearsay with intelligent certainty and without audacity, give me matter
64040	70720	and I will construct a world out of it."
70720	78720	That's Emanuel Kant from his Natural History of the Heavens, and that particular section
78720	84600	is quoted by Friedrich Nietzsche in his lectures on the pre-plotonic philosophers.
84600	90920	What we see in this quotation from Kant is an enthusiasm for science and for the explanatory
90920	93680	power of the scientific method.
93680	98800	Kant here sees his forerunners all the way back in the philosophers before Plato and
98800	104600	Socrates, referencing Democritus, the father of atomism.
104600	110520	Kant recognizes a resemblance in their theories, but also a common spirit, a common goal or
110520	116860	quest, not just a praise of science for its ability to answer individual empirical questions,
116860	119680	but to construct a world.
119680	122840	And there is a beauty to Kant's expression here.
122840	127720	That one could begin with a few starting principles, laws of motion and dispersion as
127720	133800	he calls them, general patterns or properties of how matter behaves, and then from these
133800	143160	starting parameters come to gain a coherent understanding of the immeasurably complex
143160	145080	reality that we live in.
145080	148840	For Kant, this is the allure of science.
148840	153880	And so I want to pose the question to all of us, what is the point of science?
153880	158880	It may seem like a strange question for us to ask today, but I think it's worth reflecting
158880	164840	on because, I mean, first of all, it seems obvious that we should be able to answer it.
164840	170760	But secondly, it's not a question that science itself can't answer, at least science the
170760	176100	way that we understand it today, and this is because it's a question of values.
176100	177780	Why do we value science?
177780	180640	Why do we pursue scientific knowledge?
180640	185440	Admittedly, I don't think that for most of us these questions are all that difficult
185440	186440	to answer.
187000	190120	But let's take the question seriously and assume for the sake of argument that it really
190120	194800	matters what our answer is, and whether we have the right answer.
194800	199080	And of course, we'll find that not everyone has the same answer, which is a problem in
199080	200560	and of itself.
200560	205520	Furthermore, the framework on which one should base their answer is not obvious either.
205520	210600	I mean, suppose we appeal to what might be the commonplace view that science is valuable
210600	215160	because of its utility, science gives us power over the world.
215200	219840	Or suppose we appeal to the more philosophical view that science is worth pursuing because
219840	225880	truth is valuable in and of itself, and science helps us gain knowledge and more importantly
225880	229600	to falsify incorrect knowledge so it gets us closer to the truth.
229600	232080	Science is good because truth is good, right?
232080	236480	And science is the best way of verifying or falsifying truth statements.
236480	241360	Or maybe we take an older view, the view of Kant, as I quoted from him at the beginning,
241360	247440	that science is part of a broader project of human knowledge, attempting to gain a complete
247440	251320	rational understanding of the world around them.
251320	256440	You could find positives or negatives to each of those descriptions of what science is or
256440	260880	what the value of science is, and have arguments for or against.
260880	264120	But ultimately, my point in bringing this up is that we would have to conclude that when
264120	269840	it comes to questions of values, we have no definitive means of settling these questions.
269840	271680	We know scientific means.
271680	277160	And so this takes us into territory that we might call metascience, or a discussion of
277160	279680	the philosophy of science.
279680	286320	And so today, we're going to take a look at Nietzsche's philosophy of science and the
286320	292960	great influence on his philosophy of science that he derives from Friedrich Albert Lange.
292960	297680	Now, philosophy of science is not something that Friedrich Nietzsche is usually associated
297680	298680	with.
298680	304960	It's not uncommon to encounter caricatures of Nietzsche as an irrationalist, or to see
304960	310940	the interpretations of his philosophy, which emphasize the postmodern aspects, the elements
310940	317200	of Nietzsche's thought that sort of emphasize the role of interpretation, or cleave to like
317200	318800	a pure perspectivism.
318800	322720	Now, of course, Nietzsche himself is somewhat responsible for that.
322720	329000	And so far as he writes of the problem of science, the problem of Socrates, the danger
329000	337040	that an excess of rational discursive intellect will pose, the danger that it will damage
337040	338960	life's beautiful illusions.
338960	343400	There are many variations on this type of presentation of Nietzsche, and I've given
343400	347680	this presentation of his ideas myself here.
347680	350240	And so that is to say, it's not wrong.
350240	353280	This kind of presentation of Nietzsche has its place.
353280	357720	But we must ask, does Nietzsche have a philosophy of science?
357720	363120	And what one finds, if they search for it in his work, is that indeed he does.
363120	367640	And perhaps the most interesting aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy of science is how it
367640	371640	developed and what it culminates in.
371640	376440	Because what we find when we take a closer look at this question of the Nietzschean philosophy
376440	382520	of science is that it is a secret beginning to Nietzsche's philosophizing.
382520	387680	That is, as Annie Anders and Carl Schlechter, who was in charge of the Nietzsche Archive
387680	393240	for many years, the two of them have called it, that the secret origins of Nietzsche first
393240	399160	thinking philosophically originate with his development of an understanding of the nature
399160	404560	of what science is, the point of science, and how science develops.
404560	410520	During his early days as a philologist, Nietzsche read and studied the pre-Socratic philosophers
410520	414800	or, as he called them, the pre-Platonics.
414800	422640	Figures like Anaximander, Heraclitus, Democritus, he also became familiar with philosophers
422640	428800	of science, including Neocontian figures, some of whom were scientists themselves, such
428800	434120	as Launga, Helmholtz, Von Baer, and others.
434120	438560	And finally, many of those that we count among the great philosophers today are scientists
438560	439560	as well.
439560	446360	It had important things to say about the philosophy of science, people like Leibniz and Spinoza,
446360	449320	Kant, even Schopenhauer.
449320	453320	Because of course, Nietzsche did not drop out of the ether.
453320	457000	He's not a unique figure with no precedent.
457000	462320	There are many things that are unique or peculiar to Nietzsche, but like all the other philosophers,
462320	467520	he's engaged in a dialogue with the ideas of past thinkers, and his entry to the dialogue
467520	473960	is in direct response to disputes within 19th century science, and about the philosophy
473960	475600	of science.
475600	481080	And so now you may think, what is the use in understanding 19th century science and
481080	483160	earlier views of science?
483160	488080	Like why familiarize ourselves with the ideas of Launga, or the theories of Spinoza, or
488080	491160	the mathematics of Poskovich, right?
491160	498280	These kinds of questions are why, I think, many of us avoid engaging with Nietzsche in
498280	500560	this way, right?
500560	506320	On the basis of what he thought about science and his philosophy of science, because inevitably
506320	508960	it seems outdated or irrelevant.
508960	512720	If you want to understand physics, pick up a modern physics textbook, right?
512720	515520	You don't go to Friedrich Nietzsche.
515520	520000	But in my view, understanding these things is very relevant, actually.
520040	524440	Let's take a step back and consider what we'd like to get out of this.
524440	528960	The questions we're entertaining now are not properly scientific, as we've said, but rather
528960	534080	meta-scientific, addressed to the questions of the philosophy of science, and so is the
534080	537920	goal of science to give us a true picture of the world.
537920	542360	Do insights gained through empirical data and the scientific method indicate anything
542360	545680	to us about the fundamental nature of the world?
545680	550320	If there are patterns and laws that govern reality, can we distill those patterns and
550320	558360	laws down to as few principles as possible, or is it possible to even have a single principle?
558360	561720	What is the relationship of science to metaphysics?
561720	565160	Does science require a metaphysics in order to pursue the truth?
565160	570040	In other words, if we have no theory of what the data from sense perceptions indicates,
570040	574200	no understanding of what an individual fact of reality corresponds to, you know, in the
574200	577720	grand totality of things, then do we really understand anything?
577720	583120	I might have a really sophisticated knowledge of the turning of the seasons, for example,
583120	589920	as many ancient people did, or even potentially people before the dawn of civilization.
589920	595200	But to what extent did they really have that much of a greater understanding of the world,
595200	599440	just by virtue of this fact, over somebody who didn't know of the turning of the seasons,
599560	605520	because it still contains so much personified things that they saw in nature and mythological
605520	606520	knowledge.
606520	610240	I mean, given that they didn't understand the turning of the seasons in context to be
610240	615880	a phenomenon caused by Earth's axial tilt of its orbit around the sun, right?
615880	619680	So is science just the pursuit of a bunch of disconnected facts, or is our ultimate goal
619680	624600	to correlate all these facts into a coherent understanding that counts for all of those
624600	626240	facts, right?
626240	632080	And it's difficult to say that discovering the true nature of reality, however you want
632080	637120	to describe what I just said there, it's difficult to say that that's the point of any one application
637120	640720	of the scientific method in the form of an experiment.
640720	646000	But if we don't ask the question of what we're doing when we do science generally, I think
646000	649840	we find ourselves in a very strange place where we have no logical understanding of
649840	655880	why we're pursuing what we're pursuing, even as we conduct the pursuit in itself and apparently
655920	658520	in a very logical manner.
658520	663080	And so these questions, I think that I've just laid out, there's all sorts of potential
663080	664080	answers.
664080	668920	I'm not suggesting by any means that they're impossible to answer, but simply that you're
668920	671880	not going to get the answer from the scientific method itself.
671880	678640	These are questions where you have to introduce an element of interpretation of where you
678640	681800	there's a point where you have to stop just looking at data and saying, well, this is
681800	687160	what the data says, and actually bring to bear your subjective interpretation, your
687160	692400	pattern recognizing software that your brain has given you and go out on a limb and say
692400	697920	what you think it is, right, or say what you think the answer to some of these questions
697920	698920	are.
698920	704960	Now, as we've said Nietzsche, he first comes to consider these questions through his engagement
704960	711520	with the pre-plotonic philosophers, the pre-plotonic philosophers hail from a time when the intellectuals
711560	717840	did not divide off the question of why we do science from science itself.
717840	722600	For them, the goal of constructing a metaphysical view of the world, a view based on first
722600	729000	principles, was deeply related to the project of constructing physical principles for understanding
729000	732880	the behavior of body and phenomena within the world.
732880	738800	Now, a word on terminology before we go further, I'm using Nietzsche's terms here, pre-plotonics
738800	741800	rather than pre-socratics.
741800	746160	The meaning of the term is simply the pre-socratics plus Socrates.
746160	748440	Now, why does Nietzsche call them a such?
748440	754600	Because in his view, Socrates has more in common with the other pre-socratics than he does
754600	756600	with Plato.
756600	762600	Plato is a systematizer, and he blends philosophical influence from multiple archetypes.
762600	769600	Because Socrates, like the other figures before Plato, are hemmed from a single stone, as Nietzsche
769600	773960	says, or hewed from a single stone, excuse me, so they come from a time before there were
773960	780240	formal systems of philosophy or any organized discipline defining what philosophy was.
780240	786520	Each had to define the type of the philosopher as his own innovation.
786520	790940	And so when I use the term pre-plotonic, we're talking about an era of philosophy as defined
790940	796120	by Nietzsche, before the philosophical system building and the blending of philosophical
796120	800800	styles and ideas that is found in the writings of Plato.
800800	805560	Now Nietzsche has a particular theory about who the pre-plotonics were, which he outlines
805560	811820	in his lectures on them, and my primary source for today is a book that has those lectures
811820	815680	with commentary translated by Gregory Whitlock.
815680	821220	And it's an indispensable resource for understanding the development of Nietzsche's thought, and
821220	823020	I highly recommend this book.
823020	828380	I'll be drawing in Whitlock's commentary as much as his translation, if not more so.
828380	833260	And so in any case, Nietzsche's theory when it comes to understanding the pre-plotonics
833260	839420	is that they were a series of Greek philosophers whose great insight, their collective project,
839420	846320	to speak, whether in conscious collaboration or not, was the innovation of materialism.
846320	853280	That Greek philosophy leading up to Plato represented the critique of mythological explanations
853280	858760	of the world breaking away from the supernatural view of reality, and an attempt to understand
858760	867720	reality that increasingly moved towards materialist explanations, physical laws governing reality.
867720	873020	This is important first because Nietzsche believes that this progression towards materialism
873020	875140	is cyclical.
875140	880380	While we see one example of it in the pre-plotonics, Nietzsche believes we can see the same pattern
880380	882180	in the European Enlightenment.
882180	889060	It's important to clarify, therefore, that what's repeating here is not the acquisition
889060	891260	of the exact same scientific knowledge.
891260	894660	I mean, that would be kind of an absurd claim.
894660	898720	It's given that the things that are learning and the technology available is different
898720	902560	in both cases.
902560	909440	But rather, it's a similar course of development of a worldview based on science, and what
909440	912800	that means exactly will become clear as we go on.
912800	917160	But Nietzsche doesn't believe, importantly, that this pattern is culturally specific to
917160	918160	the Greeks.
918160	921080	I think this would apply to us today, right?
921080	925660	Another reason why Nietzsche's argument may be relevant to us now is because he asserts
925660	932980	that the materialist understanding of the world is an inevitable consequence of philosophizing.
932980	939480	Furthermore, that the materialist understanding is both powerful and dangerous when it's taken
939480	943060	through to its ultimate conclusions.
943060	947980	Nietzsche asserts that the ultimate conclusion of a materialist philosophy, the goal or the
947980	955440	end of materialism as he sees it, is the forging of a single principle for understanding life
955440	962720	and understanding reality, from which all other equations and formulae can be derived,
962720	969000	from which the no longer disconnected facts of reality can be ordered, right?
969000	975600	This revolution and thought happened in fits and starts, as all revolutions do, and it
975600	980180	should be said that Nietzsche saw some figures as dead ends or regressions.
980180	985260	But nevertheless, he trots out a new chronology of the pre-plotonic philosophers, and he
985260	990360	gives a picture in which each figure takes a further step in coming up with that single
990360	995940	coherent principle for describing and explaining physical reality.
995940	1000460	And so the way Nietzsche is thinking about this, we might notice, therefore may seem
1000460	1007320	to conflate science and philosophy, or you could even say it conflates science, philosophy,
1007320	1009000	and metaphysics, right?
1009000	1011840	They all become part of the same project.
1011840	1015400	And so are there problems that could arise from this kind of framing?
1015400	1017480	I mean, of course, right?
1017480	1021920	But this is the way that many of the pre-plotonics would have thought about these things.
1021920	1030160	All of these disciplines of thought are differentiated to us now.
1030160	1036460	But they are also part of this unified, overarching thing that we call the pursuit of truth.
1036460	1042500	And maybe a good faith way or a steelman way of trying to understand the argument for conflating
1042500	1046620	these things, for doing the opposite of what we like to do in philosophy, right?
1046620	1048740	Make distinctions.
1048740	1054900	Here's maybe my steelman argument for thinking in a less granular way, the way the pre-plotonics
1054900	1060780	would, that a scientific understanding without the explanatory framework found in metaphysics
1060780	1066400	or philosophy becomes just a senseless cluster of trivial facts.
1066400	1072640	That metaphysics without philosophy or science just falls into dogmatism, superstitious religious
1072640	1074640	views of the world.
1074640	1079000	And that philosophy done without a grounding in science or without a concern for its first
1079000	1088520	principles, it becomes just context specific idiomatic sayings or idle speculation, right?
1088520	1094580	And so while we now understand the many disciplines of academia with greater granularity these
1094580	1099020	days, and that's very useful and certainly an innovation, we should still understand
1099020	1104620	the sense in which if one cares about obtaining some kind of world picture that even remotely
1104620	1111640	approaches the truth, the concerns of science and philosophy have to become unified.
1111640	1118680	That's a view shared by Edward Zeller, who's a philologist and another prominent 19th century
1118680	1123120	figure who before Nietzsche was one of the most important writers in the topic of Greek
1123120	1125120	philosophy.
1125120	1132280	Zeller writes in his outlines of the history of philosophy published in 1883, quote, what
1132280	1138460	particularly distinguishes this oldest period of Greek philosophy is the complete fusion
1138460	1143380	of philosophy and science, end quote.
1143380	1147140	Some have considered Zeller to be a Hegelian.
1147140	1152300	Whitlock argues in his commentary that Zeller bears far more similarity to the other Neocontian
1152300	1159060	thinkers that influence Nietzsche than to the Hegelians, although he certainly did have
1159060	1161300	a Hegel influence.
1161300	1166920	And in fact we can see some intellectual kinship between the two men insofar as Zeller would
1166920	1170240	go on to quote from Nietzsche's own work.
1170240	1175080	Nietzsche often goes against Zeller in these lectures, but they also find agreement on
1175080	1179840	some points and where they align most is in their fundamental attitude towards the Greeks,
1179840	1185160	as both Zeller and Nietzsche held that the study of the Greek philosophers was valuable
1185160	1187040	in and of itself.
1187040	1191740	In contrast to the view that the Greeks should be understood as merely a prerequisite to
1191740	1197860	modern philosophical or scientific thinking, or that Greek philosophy is merely an early
1197860	1205020	stage, something inferior or half formed in comparison to our modern ideas, it's simply
1205020	1207300	a prelude.
1207300	1212540	That was the common historiographical approach to Greek philosophy.
1212540	1218280	It was seen as maybe a curiosity, but nothing more.
1218280	1222360	The view of the Contians was somewhat similar.
1222360	1228320	That philosophy is separate from the history of philosophy.
1228320	1231800	Learning about the Greeks is valuable to the history of philosophy, certainly, but it's
1231800	1237800	not philosophically valuable in and of itself to study the Greeks.
1237800	1243460	You might also consider another sort of the inverse that we might find, right, of people
1243460	1247360	who wouldn't say the Greeks are unimportant, but say the Greeks are very important because
1247360	1249640	we find all of our initial ideas there.
1249640	1255400	We might consider Nietzsche's own criticisms of classicists when approaching the Greeks,
1255400	1261860	when he outlines his arguments in Birth of Tragedy, that conversely, they saw great significance
1261860	1266340	to the Greeks, but they made the mistake insofar as they approached them only to project their
1266360	1272080	own values and their own beliefs and meanings onto the Greeks.
1272080	1274840	So that was happening a lot also.
1274840	1279600	The Hegelians, on the other hand, they do something that made possible a new understanding
1279600	1286600	of the history of thought, by in some sense unifying the history of philosophy with philosophy
1286600	1288480	itself.
1288480	1294740	After Hegel, ideas are not understood as originating purely out of logical deliberation
1294800	1296880	as Kant had imagined.
1296880	1302480	Hegel affects this historical turn in philosophy, and in the wake of him, there's this concept
1302480	1309400	that ideas emerge out of a dialectic, that there's not a decontextualized, pure origin
1309400	1312440	of truth out of the lap of being.
1312440	1319200	Truth is a process, and therefore the Greeks must be understood as part of that process.
1319200	1323400	So we're getting somewhere, but nevertheless the Hegelians still tended to hold that the
1323420	1326380	Greeks were a preliminary stage, right?
1326380	1332660	Everything in history has merely been leading up to Hegel's conception of the absolute.
1332660	1337540	Philosophy and the history of philosophy are unified, yes, but there is still a progression,
1337540	1342740	upon which a Gaelian philosophy is farther along than Greek philosophy.
1342740	1348220	And so Hegel gives the Greeks far more credit, but still ultimately interprets Greek philosophy
1348220	1352180	according to his own philosophical ideas.
1352180	1356240	The difference in how Nietzsche approaches the pre-Platonics and Greek philosophy in
1356240	1362740	general is informed by the influence on his thought of the Neocontians.
1362740	1368600	The relationship between Kant and the Neocontians is very fascinating, but it's a bit complicated,
1368600	1369960	it takes a little off the path.
1369960	1376480	So the key aspect is that the Neocontians share in common with Nietzsche on this issue
1376840	1382640	The fact that they dared to look at the Greeks with an eye for what the Greeks could teach us,
1382640	1388320	not to see them as naive and less intelligent, or a mere curiosity, mere freaks of thought,
1388320	1394960	as Hegel said, past historiographers had looked at the Greeks, and not to project their own
1394960	1402680	ideas onto them, not as a preliminary stage, but as something complete in itself.
1402680	1408080	Many among the Neocontian philosophers of science look to the Greeks as themselves being
1408080	1413600	instructive and unique in possessing their own distinctive character.
1413600	1418520	And so Whitlock writes in his commentary,
1418520	1425520	Operating in stark contrast to the dominant, self-projective methods of these schools,
1425520	1429560	Nietzsche sought to learn something of the Greeks for their own sake.
1429560	1434880	He did this not because the Greeks could aid modern humanity with quaint phrases, or because
1434880	1440140	the Greeks were a necessary stage of Hegelian spirit, or because they discovered the idea
1440140	1441640	of beauty.
1441640	1446880	No, Nietzsche sought to learn of the Greeks for the value of the knowledge itself because
1446880	1450080	the Greeks were themselves fascinating and insightful.
1450080	1456120	He was careful to discover what dialectic actually employed the Greek drive to philosophy.
1456120	1461280	This dialectic is indeed one of natural science, but science has understood differently than
1461280	1467120	by either Kant or Hegel.
1467120	1474080	The reason why the Neocontians provided an ingredient that helped Nietzsche along in
1474080	1480440	moving beyond what we might call the view of Kant himself, or the Paleo-Contian view,
1480440	1487000	It's found in the fact that Friedrich Uberweg and Friedrich Albert Lange, both Neocontians,
1487000	1491880	they wrote books interpreting Greek philosophers as being materialists, and they were themselves
1491880	1494120	materialists, right?
1494120	1498920	And so they suggested that the Greeks discovered things in their pursuit of understanding the
1498920	1503840	material world that can be instructive to us still today.
1504240	1510840	Zeller, a figure that, again, has one foot in Hegelianism and another foot in Neocontianism,
1510840	1517360	he gives a great explication of this attitude, quoting from the same text as before, he writes,
1517360	1523260	The systems built up by the Greek philosophers are not to be regarded merely as a preparation
1523260	1524760	for modern philosophy.
1524760	1529920	They have a value in themselves alone as an achievement in the development of man's intellectual
1529920	1530920	life.
1531560	1537040	It was the Greeks who won for man freedom and independence of philosophic thought, who
1537040	1542520	proclaimed the autonomy of reason and gave it a two-fold application.
1542520	1547080	Wisdom in the Greek sense included not only a theoretical explanation of the world, but
1547080	1549960	also a definite practical attitude to life.
1549960	1555140	Thus, apart from independence of scientific thought, it was the freedom to live life as
1555140	1564140	he pleased, autarchy, that distinguished the Greek wise man, end quote.
1564140	1570140	Or if we want to look to somebody who is more purely Neocontian, we could look to Friedrich
1570140	1576220	Albert Lange's statements in his monumental work, History of Materialism, which is really
1576220	1577940	a central work for Nietzsche.
1577940	1583300	It's a work whose importance pervades all of Nietzsche's thought.
1583300	1590120	Nietzsche writes, quote, with the freedom and boldness of the Hellenic mind was united
1590120	1597420	and innate ability to draw inferences, to enunciate clearly and sharply general propositions,
1597420	1602580	to hold firmly and surely to the premises of an inquiry, and to arrange the results
1602580	1610140	clearly and luminously, in a word, the gift of scientific deduction, end quote.
1611140	1618060	Now, I could see an objection here, you know, insofar as Lange, Ubreweg and the other Neocontians
1618060	1623260	saw the Greeks as valuable, you know, they're the first ones daring to liberate philosophical
1623260	1627300	thought from superstition, allowing the advent of materialism, right?
1627300	1632980	And yet, these people who were saying this are themselves materialists, which means we're
1632980	1637620	looking back the pre-plotonics and we're saying, oh, they're just like me, right?
1637620	1643460	So couldn't we accuse them of doing what Nietzsche criticized the classicists for doing?
1643460	1648460	Simply projecting their own views onto the subject of their research.
1648460	1652900	And further, might we not say the same of Nietzsche?
1652900	1658340	Because he gets many of his own ideas, he says, originate in these figures.
1658340	1665460	So Whitlock writes, quote, Nietzsche too projects himself onto the Greeks, seeing them as discoverers
1665460	1670220	of the will to power and of the eternal return of the same.
1670220	1676940	Their struggle is one of materialism, precipitating an unconscious slide over many centuries into
1676940	1682540	the abyss of nihilism, end quote.
1682540	1687460	And so, while we inarguably see the first seeds of Nietzsche's philosophy in his study
1687460	1693540	of the pre-plotonics, we have to ask whether he genuinely discovered something from them,
1693540	1697740	that he then brought into the present through his writings, or whether he simply projected
1697740	1698740	onto them.
1698740	1701460	And we could ask the same of Lange and Uberweg.
1701460	1704660	But suffice to say, I think this question is unanswerable, right?
1704660	1709020	So whether these seeds of the ideas came from the Greeks or were merely projected onto them,
1709020	1714340	it's only through Nietzsche's engagement with these figures that these ideas gestated.
1714340	1719940	It's through the interaction of his mind with the Greeks that these ideas emerged.
1719940	1724660	And in the, you know, it's a simple fact, before him no one else had found these ideas
1724660	1728780	as clearly, put them as clearly, as powerfully, as forcefully as Nietzsche did.
1728780	1733740	And so in some sense, we can set that issue aside as to whether Nietzsche was actually
1733740	1738140	engaging with the Greeks in a truly original way or not, that transcended the limitations
1738140	1741060	of these other schools.
1741060	1746140	But by understanding the dialogue and the evolution of how philosophers tended to look
1746140	1752900	at the Greeks, we can better understand where Nietzsche saw himself entering this dialogue,
1752900	1756060	this dialogue that was now running for centuries.
1756060	1762020	And now we understand the question being asked, how long we approach the philosophers of antiquity?
1762020	1766460	What is the nature of their significance?
1766460	1772100	Nietzsche answers these questions following in the thought of neocontians such as Lange,
1772100	1777100	that the pre-Platonics charted a course forward into materialism as we've described.
1777100	1785100	And Nietzsche argues that materialist philosophy is a kind of prerequisite scientific experimentation,
1785100	1788540	at least as a methodological presupposition.
1788540	1793020	And I think there's a good argument for that, that whether or not you fully accept like a
1793020	1800420	purely materialistic view of the world, it's almost a prerequisite methodological assumption
1800420	1803460	to go gather empirical data.
1803460	1809860	And so thus training ourselves to think materialistically is required for science.
1809860	1816020	And so Nietzsche believes that scientific thinking must arrive hand in hand with philosophy
1816020	1817660	itself.
1817660	1825020	And the conclusion therefore is that the advent of the activity of philosophizing and the philosopher
1825020	1835140	as a specific type among other types in society necessarily arises mutually with materialism.
1835140	1840900	This doesn't mean you get philosophers, you know, some guy identifies himself as a philosopher
1840900	1844100	and suddenly your whole society is materialistic overnight.
1844100	1851780	It means that the tendency and the capacity to think in materialistic terms as a presupposition
1851780	1854660	necessary for the scientific method.
1854660	1860020	It begins to emerge and it does so with greater and greater force over time as the power of
1860020	1863980	science becomes revealed to a culture.
1863980	1869340	Longa provides the basis for this idea in a section from history of materialism as follows.
1869340	1870340	Quote,
1870340	1875900	Materialism is as old as philosophy, but not older.
1875900	1881060	The physical conception of nature, which dominates the earliest periods of the history of thought
1881060	1888060	remained ever entangled in the contradictions of dualism and the fantasies of personification.
1888060	1893940	The first attempts to escape from these contradictions, to conceive the world as a unity and to rise
1893940	1900540	above the vulgar errors of the senses leads directly into the sphere of philosophy.
1900540	1905700	And amongst these first attempts, materialism has its place.
1905700	1908140	End quote.
1908300	1914940	So there is a logic to conflating these things, the emergence of philosophy with the emergence
1914940	1918580	of science and the emergence of materialism.
1918580	1924100	We tend to think that some form of advanced, you know, scientific, materialist mindset
1924100	1929020	that that's a type of ideology specific to modernity.
1929020	1932860	But Longa and Nietzsche would both oppose that view.
1932980	1939500	Longa emerges as a form of wisdom, which is critical of religion and which then pursues
1939500	1944420	truth outside of revelatory knowledge, you know, outside of, you know, in ancient Greece,
1944420	1949780	it would have been like, irracular wisdom and the superstitions of the mystery cults.
1949780	1957380	It attempts to systematize and make things clear, you know, not vague or mystical and
1957420	1964900	not like the disconnected, fragmentary, aphoristic wisdom, right, of people like the sages of
1964900	1966140	old.
1966140	1972500	And where this inevitably leads is for philosophy to question explanations of the world, which
1972500	1979220	have to venture outside of what we can understand or observe by personifying nature or seeing
1979220	1983500	the work of gods or spirits behind the phenomenal world.
1983500	1988460	The more that the light of reason is applied, the more these avenues from explaining the
1988460	1993900	material world in terms of a supernatural world, the more those are cut off.
1993900	1999060	And the completion of this process is to explain the material world purely in terms of the
1999060	2003820	activities and processes that we can perceive and measure.
2003820	2008380	The final or ultimate end of that project is to produce a unified understanding of the
2008380	2010700	world within those terms.
2010700	2016620	And that's sort of the story of the pre-Platonics as Nietzsche sees it.
2016620	2024220	And here we see how another influence underlying all this, which I haven't mentioned.
2024220	2028580	There's a very big influence in Nietzsche's life that comes into the story here to provide
2028580	2031500	a unique twist to his approach.
2031500	2036780	And that is he brings in that opponent of Hegel as an influence on his thought.
2036780	2039140	And that is Schopenhauer.
2039140	2042700	Arthur Schopenhauer is the great philosopher of the will.
2042700	2047260	As a contemporary of Hegel's, he raged against Hegelian philosophy.
2047260	2051740	That Hegel had taken cons great insights into a completely unproductive direction.
2051740	2058020	Nevertheless, Nietzsche's use of Schopenhauer is not so much to bludgeon the Hegelian view
2058020	2059020	of history.
2059020	2064580	Rather, Nietzsche builds on the Hegelian as much as anyone else did in the wake of Hegel.
2064580	2070100	Hegel was so ubiquitous in his influence that fighting against Hegel would have been a bit
2070100	2073860	foolish in some sense, and that isn't what Nietzsche does.
2073860	2079980	Instead, he picks up on something within Schopenhauer, within his ideas that helps us to give a coherent
2079980	2085140	narrative as to how all this works, what the Greeks were doing, and why this phenomenon
2085140	2091660	of the philosopher arises, and why it exists in a culture, and what it's driving towards.
2091940	2098540	That is, by drawing on the concept of a single will underlying everything.
2098540	2103460	So you might wonder why is drawing upon or explaining the concept of a will that's driving
2103460	2106460	philosophy even necessary?
2106460	2112380	Nietzsche has a pretty good argument for this, and this argument is that there is no obvious
2112380	2116620	need for a civilization to develop philosophy.
2116620	2117620	It's wonderful.
2117620	2121220	I love when Nietzsche points things out like this because he's, I mean at this point in
2121260	2123060	his career, he's not exactly a philosopher.
2123060	2134340	He's still a philologist, albeit philosophically curious, we might say, but not too many academics
2134340	2140700	at that time would have questioned the validity or the usefulness of doing philosophy.
2140700	2148500	That's sort of the heart and soul of the university, the most important among the faculties.
2148500	2152060	But Nietzsche says there's no obvious need for it, and that in fact we actually have
2152060	2154940	counterfactual examples.
2154940	2160660	So Nietzsche writes, and this is in the introduction to the pre-plotonic lectures, quote, the question
2160660	2162740	is attractive enough.
2162740	2166980	How did the Greeks philosophize during the richest and most luxuriant period of their
2166980	2168780	power?
2168780	2173740	Or more principled, did they philosophize in this period?
2173740	2178420	The answer will decisively clarify the Hellenic character for us.
2178420	2185340	In itself, philosophy is of course necessary neither for one human being nor for a people.
2185340	2191820	The Romans, as long as they grew only from within, are entirely unphilosophical.
2191820	2197340	It depends on the deepest roots of an individual and of a people, whether he philosophizes
2197340	2198340	or not.
2198340	2203620	It concerns whether he has such an excess of intellect that he no longer directs it
2203620	2211380	only for personal, individual purposes, but rather with it arrives at a pure intuition.
2211380	2218420	The Romans are not artists, for the same reason they are not philosophers, end quote.
2218420	2223820	So the Romans, unphilosophical people, as he says, but so long as they only grew from
2223820	2224820	within.
2224820	2229820	What he means by that is that Rome received religions and philosophies from the many places
2229820	2233940	it traded with and conquered and incorporated into the empire.
2233940	2240940	But Rome didn't have a homegrown philosophy, it didn't have a homegrown class of philosophers.
2240940	2245420	You look through Roman history, the best you can do is maybe someone like Cicero, but Cicero
2245420	2253180	is a philosopher of law and government, this pragmatic forms of philosophy.
2253180	2257620	And whenever he gets in anything deeper, like ethics, he's almost totally dependent
2257620	2260700	on the Greeks for his ideas.
2260700	2264900	And so the Romans themselves, they're an intensely practical people, and their thought
2264900	2274980	was, accordingly, unartistic, unself-reflective, self-assured, martial discipline.
2274980	2278940	And then on the other hand, the Greeks do produce philosophers during the height of
2278940	2284300	their power as a civilization, and interestingly Nietzsche makes an etymological analysis of
2284300	2290620	the term wise in ancient Greek, which is the term that would have been used for the
2290620	2293700	type of person that philosophized.
2293700	2297620	And in Greek, it means something akin to useless.
2297620	2303580	This does not apply to all knowledge, but specifically to the type of knowledge of the
2303580	2304580	philosopher.
2304580	2309620	The philosopher's knowledge is not the knowledge of an art or a craft, something which produces
2309620	2311300	value or utility.
2312060	2315260	Rather, the philosopher has useless knowledge.
2315260	2317300	That's what it means to call him wise.
2317300	2320340	In other words, being wise is itself a luxury.
2320340	2321900	It doesn't have practical utility.
2321900	2325860	It doesn't have value in the sense that a, certainly not that a Homo economicus would
2325860	2333340	understand, and maybe it has even less so in the martial world of ancient Rome.
2333340	2338820	To be wise is the privilege of those who have leisure time and who can spend their energies
2338860	2345580	in their efforts in directions that go beyond mere survival or day-to-day existence.
2345580	2348060	Whitlock elaborates on this in his commentary.
2348060	2353460	He speaks of the first philosopher Thales as an example here, and I'm quoting in an
2353460	2356540	upridged form, quote,
2356540	2361300	What Thales knew surely seemed useless to the ordinary Greek.
2361300	2366700	The adjective wise connotes useless, luxurious, or superabundant intellect, which Nietzsche
2366700	2370660	will later connect to the Greek notion of noose.
2370660	2376380	Designating a person wise, connoted to the ordinary language user, a knowledge of a field
2376380	2380420	such as astrology, shamanism, or alchemy.
2380420	2387780	To such a person, Thales would have been indistinguishable from other uselessly knowledgeable people.
2387780	2392380	Such fine distinctions between astrologers and the rest would have collapsed into the
2392380	2394860	adjective wise.
2394860	2399300	To the ordinary language user, such thought is a luxury requiring superabundance of time,
2399300	2408940	wealth, or intellect, noose, and consequently, tied to an alien reality, end quote.
2408940	2411340	And so we have a counterfactual.
2411340	2415660	During the flourishing of their power, Rome didn't need philosophers, which means philosophers
2415660	2420020	are not a necessary factor to an ascending civilization.
2420020	2426380	But the Greeks did produce philosophers, and so that presses the question as to why,
2426380	2431180	which becomes all the more pressing, when their term for what philosophical wisdom indicates
2431180	2435700	is that it's useless, and thus in some way unnecessary.
2435700	2441700	So I would say at that point, it raises a question about what is it that drives the
2441700	2444740	will to philosophize.
2444740	2449300	And it reveals something about the Greeks themselves when we follow this inquiry.
2449300	2455340	The Greeks teach us something insofar as they demonstrate to us an example of a culture
2455340	2461580	that produced geniuses who all drive toward an encapsulation of the world within these
2461580	2471460	principles of reason, and as Zeller says, doing so with the goal of clear enunciation
2471460	2473420	of the principles of reason.
2473420	2477380	And so this brings us back to some of the initial questions I raised.
2477380	2478740	What is the point of science?
2478740	2481860	What are we doing in pursuing scientific truth?
2481860	2487260	And does science require a philosophy of science, or a metaphysics, and so on and so forth?
2487260	2494460	Schopenhauer is the final ingredient in understanding the pre-plotonic specifically, and science
2494460	2497540	generally within Nietzsche's new framework.
2497540	2502620	Nietzsche can come at this question of why a culture would produce something ostensibly
2502620	2507780	useless like the philosopher, but now with the understanding of the emergence of science
2507820	2512980	and philosophy as driven by an underlying will.
2512980	2518900	And the final object of that will is the encapsulation of the world in a single principle, the explanation
2518900	2523060	of the material through the material world itself.
2523060	2528900	That's the ultimate object of the intellect's desire as it seeks to liberate itself, liberate
2528900	2534820	itself from dogma and from mythology, and leap from specialized, scattered, or disconnected
2534860	2541500	knowledge into some sort of constellated, coherent world picture.
2541500	2546380	Should be noted, will to power is not a fully formed idea at this point yet.
2546380	2550620	Nietzsche hasn't even coined the term, really, but he has a head start because Schopenhauer
2550620	2555620	has already provided the idea of the will as the inner character of all being.
2555620	2560280	Schopenhauer also gives us an understanding of the various phenomena of the world as gradations
2560280	2563780	of the will's self-manifestations.
2563900	2570900	So he has this working picture of the will to go on as a sort of provisional explanation.
2570900	2575540	Nietzsche says something in these lectures, then, that shows a prefiguration of his will
2575540	2581100	to power idea, and the idea that the pursuit of truth or the pursuit of scientific knowledge
2581100	2587600	is a rarefied form of a more fundamental drive or of a more fundamental will.
2588600	2595600	The intellect must not only desire surreptitious delights, it must become completely free
2596360	2598920	and celebrate Saturnalia.
2598920	2605020	The liberated spirit surveys things, and now, for the first time, mundane existence appears
2605020	2609720	to him worthy of contemplation as a problem.
2609720	2615920	This is the true characteristic of the philosophical drive, wonderment at that which lies before
2615920	2617600	everyone.
2617600	2621480	The most mundane phenomenon is becoming.
2621480	2626480	With it, Ionian philosophy begins.
2626480	2633480	So, when he says the intellect must become free and celebrate Saturnalia, that is, of
2633480	2640480	course, the Roman holiday, where the slave gets to play the master for the day and the
2640480	2644480	masters serve the slaves, so everything is reversed, right?
2644480	2648880	The slave is a free man, though, is the thing that he's invoking here.
2648880	2655400	And so, taking joy in understanding the most mundane phenomenon, that's the beginning
2655400	2658540	of philosophy and the beginning of science.
2658540	2664440	From this perspective, we can see how an appeal to will, Schopenhauer's will, to explain
2664440	2666680	the drive to science makes sense.
2666680	2671120	It's the desire for freedom of the intellect from all constraint.
2671120	2675600	That of course leads the intellect to seek dominion over all the world because that's
2675600	2679360	the only way to be free of all the world's many constraints.
2679360	2682800	And by this token, all the world becomes interesting.
2682800	2688200	Even the smallest, simplest, inanimate things become phenomena to be understood.
2688200	2693360	Every object offers a potential explanation about some part of reality.
2693360	2698000	And so, we have the understanding of what this drive towards the scientific mindset
2698000	2703520	is, taking joy in expanding the intellect's energy to understand everything, even the
2703520	2706360	smallest things.
2706360	2711240	So now, we're going to look at the interpretations of the pre-plotonic figures as they appear
2711240	2715200	within these lectures, Nietzsche's interpretations of them.
2715200	2719880	And through this understanding of Nietzsche's view of the emergence of scientific materialism
2719880	2726080	in ancient Greece, we get an insight into, or further insight into the secret beginnings
2726080	2728640	of his philosophy.
2728640	2734120	So the first pre-plotonic philosopher is Thales.
2734120	2739720	And Thales is sort of the traditional first among the philosophers.
2739720	2741960	And that always presents a problem.
2741960	2743440	Nietzsche acknowledges this in his lectures.
2743440	2747760	He says, anytime we say that this was the first one, he says, this is almost always
2747760	2753040	like a sort of, it's a falsification, it's an oversimplification of reality.
2753040	2756240	The way he deals with that question, actually, is very interesting.
2756240	2763360	But even though philosophy existed in some inchoate, unorganized form, Nietzsche says
2763360	2769800	that the real question is not when philosophy arose, but when philosophers arose, he shifts
2769800	2770880	the question in that way.
2770880	2776520	He's not asking, well, when did a formal discipline such as philosophy become codified, or when
2776520	2778480	did people first think philosophically, right?
2778480	2780560	Because how could you answer those questions?
2780560	2786200	But rather, when did the first person arise who appears as an entirely different kind
2786200	2789360	of figure from the ones who came before?
2789360	2794400	And when did that first figure arise who was definitively a philosopher and not classified
2794400	2796800	under something else?
2796800	2801640	He evaluates Thales as the first philosopher on that basis.
2801640	2807040	And even though there could still be arguments either way that Thales could sort of fade
2807040	2812800	into the background of all the other sages, Nietzsche thinks he's got a pretty good argument
2812800	2814400	as to why Thales is the first.
2814400	2820800	So to talk about Thales, he asserts that water is the fundamental element of all matter.
2820800	2828000	All matter as we experience it, while it may be configured in a certain way as to be organic,
2828000	2833520	or metallic, or wood, or fire, or air.
2833520	2839200	Thales says it's all in its most fundamental, most basic form, water.
2839200	2842440	It's also worth noting that Thales is also a scientist.
2842440	2846360	He's noted for making a discovery having to do with eclipses.
2846360	2850480	He was a mathematician as well.
2850480	2855400	Nietzsche believes that Thales has overcome the previous preludes to the philosophical
2855400	2862920	approach to life, the areas where maybe philosophy was sort of practiced in various scattered
2862920	2868200	forms, but he overcomes all of this and steps forward as the first philosopher.
2868200	2869200	Why?
2869200	2873520	Well, Nietzsche says he's the first because he overcomes three things, which Nietzsche
2873520	2876840	lists, and he overcomes them all at once.
2876840	2881760	First, the preliminary, sporadic era of philosophy.
2881760	2886520	These are the sages who spoke in aphorisms and sayings, but created no system.
2887520	2894600	Second, the oracular, revelatory precursor to philosophy that's found in religion.
2894600	2898400	And third, the various sciences.
2898400	2904080	Thales overcomes these by positing his theory that everything is water.
2904080	2909280	That explanation of this might seem a bit bizarre, but we'll look to Whitlock's commentary
2909280	2911280	once more.
2911920	2917520	Nietzsche's strange claim that Thales overcame the various sciences, strange because even
2917520	2924040	if Greek thought is science, it had not specialized into various sciences, it becomes clear when
2924040	2929920	we realize that Nietzsche saw in Thales the drive or will to reduce the world to as few
2929920	2937080	laws as possible, and Thales assertion that all is water speaks from such a will, however
2937080	2940760	rudimentarily.
2940760	2946000	And further in the commentary, it's actually some pages later, Whitlock elaborates further,
2946000	2951160	quote, Thales goes beyond mythic thought, use of sporadic proverbs, and even individual
2951160	2957080	scientific pursuits to arrive at a multi-scientific understanding.
2957080	2963760	His interests went beyond this or that physical phenomenon to the will to comprehend all physical
2963760	2967880	phenomena end quote.
2967880	2971760	So there we have it, the beginning of philosophy in Nietzsche's view, the first philosopher
2971760	2974240	of the West, Thales.
2974240	2980320	He represents to Nietzsche not just a philosopher, but a figure containing within him the entire
2980320	2986120	story of the scientific drive, the entire impetus for the materialist project.
2986120	2991800	He's the manifestation of this will to comprehend the entire physical world, the will to render
2991800	2994000	the world into as few laws as possible.
2994000	2999960	And of course, the fewest possible number of laws would be what would be one law, right?
2999960	3001640	But we'll get there.
3001640	3006760	Anyway, we can see the direct influence again on Nietzsche's thought from Friedrich Albert
3006760	3010640	Longa, who also describes Thales as a materialist.
3010640	3016320	And so this is from the history of materialism, quote.
3016320	3022960	Materialism only becomes a complete system when matter is conceived as purely material.
3022960	3028680	That is, when its constituent particles are not a sort of thinking matter, but physical
3028680	3035540	bodies, which are moved in obedience to merely physical principles, and being in themselves
3035540	3042200	without sensations, produce sensations in thought by particular forms of their combinations.
3042200	3049080	And thorough going materialism seems always necessarily to be atomism.
3049080	3055480	And so again, the animated magnet of Thales harmonizes exactly with the expression, all
3055480	3060720	things are full of gods, and yet is at bottom clearly to be distinguished from the way in
3060720	3068880	which atomists attempt to explain the attraction of iron by the magnet, end quote.
3068880	3073200	And so very important things in this quote here, Longa is not only setting up what sort
3073200	3078680	of the litmus test for how materialist your system is, which is very important, but he
3078680	3080400	talks about the animated magnet.
3080400	3084600	That's a reference to the idea that Thales said the magnet has a soul, right?
3084600	3089880	The soul in human beings is how we account for humans ability to affect our own environment,
3089880	3090880	right?
3090880	3095800	To, or to, to affect movement, to move around, not simply be affected.
3095800	3099480	We're animate, we're not inanimate, right?
3099480	3104840	So the soul, we, that must be the thing that creates movement in his view, and thus the
3104840	3108280	magnet must have a soul because the magnet moves iron.
3108280	3112760	So obviously, you know, Thales is the first burst of materialist thought.
3112760	3115640	He's not the completion of the project by any means.
3115640	3119880	But we see the nature of this tendency, the underlying will.
3119880	3125240	His position naturally creates problems, however, or confusions, which become questions for
3125240	3127000	further figures to solve.
3127000	3132400	And so we'll see this play out again and again with this sort of dialectic that emerges.
3132400	3139120	Each of these parallels between Thales and three other figures who emerged in the European
3139120	3140120	Enlightenment.
3140120	3145840	First, he compares Thales to Paracelsus, who was an alchemist, a scientist, and a philosopher
3145840	3151600	of the 1500s, and who had his own theory concerning the transformation of water.
3151600	3154680	You know, Paracelsus, through his work in chemistry, he came to believe that water was
3154680	3157320	the fundamental form of matter.
3157320	3160720	Water for Paracelsus is associated with the feminine.
3160720	3163600	So we see some like, you know, alchemical ideas in there.
3163600	3169760	It's the necessary condition for all flora, you know, all plant life, all organic matter,
3169760	3174800	alcoholic spirits, oil based substances, alkali, you know, and so on and so forth.
3174800	3179480	And so that's why he would draw the conclusion that water is so fundamental.
3179480	3186000	The reason why Nietzsche makes this comparison is for the same fact that Paracelsus was definitely
3186000	3192960	pursuing a scientific theory, which was materialist in character, or at least somewhat, driving
3192960	3194960	towards materialism, we'll say.
3194960	3201000	And furthermore, it was roughly analogous to the same hypothesis that Thales makes.
3201000	3206080	And so this helps Nietzsche to establish the case that what Thales was doing can be classified
3206080	3209080	as scientific in the same way.
3209080	3214880	You know, another point of comparison is Antoine Lavossier, a French chemist who lived in the
3214880	3221240	18th century, and Lavossier had done experiments by which he'd attempted to boil water for
3221240	3228000	a prolonged period to see if it created sediment or, you know, became solid, trying to demonstrate
3228000	3233640	that you could transmute an element, change it from water to earth, which was a form of
3233640	3237440	struggle against the Aristotelian dogma.
3237440	3242440	Whitlock helps explain why it's necessary for Nietzsche to therefore make the above
3242440	3243440	two comparisons.
3243440	3251240	Quote, this lecture on Thales does not simple-mindedly conflate him with Paracelsus or Lavossier.
3251240	3256600	Nietzsche suggests that the continuing tenability in modern times of theories like theirs lends
3256600	3262200	validity to interpreting Thales' fragments as scientific notions.
3262200	3264360	End quote.
3264360	3270960	The third point of comparison Nietzsche makes here is he compares Thales to the Kant-Liplas
3270960	3273960	hypothesis.
3273960	3282560	Nietzsche writes, quote, Thales sought a material less solid and properly capable of formation.
3282560	3287120	He begins along a path that the Ionian philosophers follow after him.
3287120	3292960	Actually, astronomical facts justify his belief that a less solid aggregate condition must
3292960	3296880	have given rise to current circumstances.
3296880	3304360	Here we should recall the Kant-Liplas hypothesis concerning a gaseous precondition of the universe.
3304360	3309600	In following the same direction, the Ionian philosophers were certainly on the right path.
3309600	3315960	To conceive the entirety of such a multiferous universe as merely formal differentiation
3315960	3322680	of one fundamental material belongs to an inconceivable freedom in boldness.
3322680	3329000	This is a service of such a magnitude that no one may aspire to it a second time.
3329000	3331720	End quote.
3331720	3338960	So he uses the same language there describing the Greeks in terms of freedom and boldness.
3338960	3345920	And the Kant-Liplas hypothesis, which Kant in some sense makes reference to in the quote
3345920	3352440	that we started the episode with, it's the idea of a gaseous initial state to the universe.
3352440	3359440	It's an apparent chaos which is transformed by physical laws over time into some more
3359440	3364600	complex state as we, you know, the state that it's in as we observe it today, which means
3364600	3371200	you're starting from one form of matter and then through physical forces you get many
3371200	3372360	forms.
3372360	3378600	So Kant is, he's positing a fundamental form of material which acts in a certain way such
3378600	3382720	that as a necessary result you get all the conditions we see.
3382720	3388000	So again Nietzsche is not saying that Thales and the Kant-Liplas hypothesis are the same
3388000	3389000	thing.
3389000	3395420	He's saying that the same road that Thales is traveling is found in the idea of a gaseous
3395420	3402520	precondition to the universe, i.e. that we begin with matter all the same form and it
3402520	3404880	changes an accord with the laws of nature, right?
3404880	3409320	Or we get the situation we're in today as Kant says, you know, give me matter and I
3409320	3412440	shall construct a world out of it.
3412440	3419160	The next significant figure, actually more significant than Thales is Anak Simondar.
3419160	3422720	Anak Simondar takes things further.
3422720	3428800	He still attempts to hypothesize about the nature of being, but not by proposing another
3428800	3434440	qualitative thing at the base of all reality as Thales does, you know, something definitive
3434440	3436920	like water.
3436920	3445160	Anak Simondar posits a principle that exists prior to any of the elements, including water.
3445160	3448200	You know, I think he still says water is the most fundamental of them, but before that
3448200	3451320	he says there's warmth and cold.
3451320	3455640	These two forces are more fundamental than water and when mixed together they produce
3455640	3456640	water.
3456640	3461000	You know, it's the semen of the world that gives rise to all the other elements.
3461000	3464640	But so far that's just a small advancement on what Thales had said.
3464640	3470360	Anak Simondar's main contribution is that he then takes it a step further than that
3470360	3478600	and says this eternal flux of warmth and cold is not itself the most fundamental thing.
3478600	3483360	Even that arises from something else, from something that's still more fundamental, which
3483360	3486240	is called the indefinite.
3486240	3488240	That's how Nietzsche insists on translating it.
3488880	3498680	The indefinite is this ultimate unity, Anak Simondar's first principle of nature, quoting
3498680	3504640	here from Whitlock in an abridged form, quote, as Nietzsche argues, the cosmic significance
3504640	3510760	of the indefinite is not as a grand collection of all qualities into infinity.
3510760	3516080	Its importance lies in the fact that it alone has no qualities at all.
3516080	3522040	In contrast to the watery universal flux with its countless qualities, the indefinite
3522040	3529440	is quality-less matter, the substratum to all predicates, but not itself a predicate
3529440	3533960	or predicated, end quote.
3533960	3539200	Nietzsche's argument is that the advancement here is moving from a type of fundamental
3539200	3544320	matter with a certain quality to the idea of the quality-less.
3544320	3550440	And again, we're operating within this framework that blends or fails to separate philosophy
3550440	3556960	and science, and so really, we can say that Anak Simondar is the first philosopher-depositor
3556960	3558840	thing in itself.
3558840	3561560	That's what his indefinite really is.
3561560	3565400	By definition, it has no definite qualities.
3565400	3570360	It's a fundamental form of reality that we can acknowledge but not describe, because
3570360	3575000	anything describable becomes split off from the indefinite.
3575000	3581200	It's an important point in the history of philosophy, also because Anak Simondar brings
3581200	3584200	a moral dimension into this.
3584200	3589840	His world picture, his attempt to bound the boundless within a single law, or the smallest
3589840	3598320	set of principles, has moral implications, insofar as he explains this reality of temporal
3598320	3605280	things with definite qualities, which are constantly arising and passing away, by asserting
3605280	3611640	that every phenomenon owes a debt to the indefinite for its individuated existence.
3611640	3616780	So, we're living in this world where everything's arising and passing away, and then someone
3616780	3622880	comes along and says, the fundamental reality is this indefinite thing, which never arises
3622880	3625320	or passes away.
3625320	3626320	How do you get from A to B?
3627320	3631880	The question is, why is reality in this way that seems so fundamentally opposed to the
3631880	3637000	way you're describing what you say the fundamental reality is?
3637000	3640960	You need to answer a theodicy to some extent.
3640960	3644720	Theodicy is the wrong word.
3644720	3651920	He says, Anak Simondar, that everything from people to rocks to trees to planets, even
3651920	3655760	the more fundamental elements or patterns.
3655760	3663120	All of these things steal their existence from the indefinite, and that means that our
3663120	3669480	existence within this dynamic change, this becoming, as we called it, our very lives
3669480	3676680	are a form of injustice, and that injustice is remedied when we're returned to the indefinite
3676680	3679480	at the end of things.
3679480	3683920	As for what all this has to do with the development of a scientific or materialist philosophy,
3683960	3688640	BitLock gives another excellent explanation, I must say.
3688640	3695760	Quote, by introducing the indefinite into natural philosophy, Anak Simondar raised the
3695760	3699880	crucial philosophical issue of time.
3699880	3702900	The indefinite itself is timeless.
3702900	3708240	As ungenerated and indestructible, it is outside time altogether.
3708240	3714520	For each individual world, or monad, time begins only when it breaks off from the indefinite,
3714520	3718280	and ends only with its own destruction.
3718280	3723320	Each individual world is its own monadic measurement of time.
3723320	3727480	With a succession of worlds, time begins anew again and again.
3727480	3732320	Likewise, within one successive world, each individual measures time according to its
3732320	3735360	own monadic existence.
3735360	3740880	Time begins and ends for each existent thing with its own beginning and end.
3740880	3747160	The larger universe undergoes time in a similar monadic fashion.
3747160	3750540	Microcosm and macrocosm are time monads.
3750540	3755160	Only the indefinite is temporally indefinite.
3755160	3763360	Nietzsche calls this Anak Simandrian time monadism, a view of the world worthy of serious consideration.
3764360	3771360	This time monadism view is very similar to a fragment of an essay that Nietzsche wrote
3771360	3777840	in 1873 called the Time Atomism Fragment, which is something I plan to cover someday,
3777840	3782960	although getting too deeply into this topic now may derail this talk and take us too far
3782960	3785960	off the path of examining materialism.
3785960	3790840	But while this type of thought from Anak Simondar is awfully metaphysical in comparison to the
3790840	3796600	way we regard scientific thought today, again, I think Nietzsche is correct to perceive.
3796600	3802400	It was an attempt to hypothesize about the nature of time, which is a physics question
3802400	3804840	as much as a metaphysical one.
3804840	3809280	And that perhaps we should notice relative to his era that Anak Simondar is not talking
3809280	3817400	about time by invoking Zeus or Kronos, he's conceiving of time in a non-anthropomorphic
3817400	3825000	way and in a way that makes time a force which is impersonal and emotionless.
3825000	3831680	This is in stark contrast to the Greek picture of the gods, and so this is another thing
3831680	3837440	clawed away from the vague and cloudy explanations of mythology and brought into the light of
3837440	3839320	reason.
3839320	3846520	And furthermore, this type of theorizing helps open up new avenues of questions, once again,
3846520	3850320	for future figures to come along and answer.
3850320	3855800	How can things with qualities arise from something which itself has no qualities?
3855800	3859040	Is there a force that governs the rules of what is generated?
3859040	3865920	Would not this force be something above and beyond the indefinite itself?
3865920	3871240	If it's in the fundamental nature of the indefinite to generate things, wouldn't this nature of
3871240	3877200	generation therefore be a quality, thus making it something definite, something that we can
3877200	3880200	define by the fact that it generates, right?
3880200	3885320	And so these are all sorts of the things that come up in the dialectic.
3885320	3892720	Now in this accession of or the chronology of pre-platonics, we're going to skip Anaximonies,
3892720	3896120	who Nietzsche sees as sort of a minor figure.
3896120	3904160	We're also going to skip Gasp, Pythagoras, because as Nietzsche argues, Pythagoras is
3904160	3907800	really a cult leader and a superstitious religious figure.
3907800	3914360	And that might seem surprising to say, given that the Pythagoreans were seen as scientific
3914360	3918600	innovators, you know, they're mathematical atomists and so on.
3918600	3921200	So shouldn't they be, you know, fit right in?
3921200	3926480	And the later Pythagoreans do, but Nietzsche has an argument about this, which was novel
3926480	3932960	for his time, but I think is widely accepted now, where he drew on the work of his friend
3932960	3940000	Erwin Road, another philologist, to argue that the Pythagoreans came later than Pythagoras.
3940000	3945280	And that Pythagoras, he's a very interesting figure in terms of his personality and in
3945280	3950120	terms of the archetype he represents, but that he ultimately is very different from
3950120	3952960	the Pythagoreans who came later.
3952960	3955640	And Nietzsche treats them entirely separately.
3955640	3959200	And Pythagoras therefore ends up being, he's very important because he's archetypal as
3959200	3966480	this like mystical, regal, law dispensing figure, you know, he's got this cult of personality
3966480	3972160	and Nietzsche sees the persona of Pythagoras as an aspect of Plato's personality.
3972160	3978920	He's one of the three archetypes that sort of Plato blends together.
3978920	3985680	And so that's not that Pythagoras is overall an important, but for understanding the development
3985680	3992760	of materialism in ancient Greece, he's not really a important figure.
3992760	3995920	Another thing that Nietzsche is very concerned with in this whole thing, I should say, which
3995920	4000760	maybe I'm not getting across, it's also partly why I'm reading more of the commentary than
4000760	4005680	the translation itself, because the translation of the lectures is very interesting.
4005680	4010520	But Nietzsche is very concerned in these lectures with establishing the chronology
4010520	4016080	of the preplotonic figures, which it makes sense because it's key to proving that his
4016080	4022280	narrative is correct, his narrative of how philosophy arose hand in hand with materialism.
4022280	4028640	But since this is sort of an esoteric debate that, you know, is taking place within among
4028640	4035320	classical philologists, right, we're not going to spend any time talking about his chronological
4035320	4036320	arguments here.
4036320	4039640	We'll leave that to the philologists and we'll just take Nietzsche's arguments for granted
4039640	4042280	on that front.
4042280	4045440	Moving on, we come to Heraclitus.
4045440	4047680	Heraclitus is of central importance to Nietzsche.
4047680	4050400	We did a whole episode just on Heraclitus.
4050400	4052340	That's all the way back in episode five.
4052340	4056840	And we also covered some of the material from this episode in order to contextualize Heraclitus
4056840	4057840	there.
4057840	4061200	So if you do go back and listen to that one, you haven't heard it, you might hear some
4061200	4063160	of the same points covered.
4063160	4070360	But we have to now include Heraclitus in this examination of the pre-Platonics for a different
4070360	4076200	reason because he's part of this descent into materialism.
4076200	4081720	And so here we see a new development on this idea of finding a means of describing the
4081720	4087720	fundamental nature of reality, and it ties in with these considerations about time which
4087720	4091560	Nietzsche has brought up in Annex Cemetery.
4091640	4096920	Well, Heraclitus is often contrasted with Thales, the guy who said everything was fire,
4096920	4099840	whereas Thales said everything was water.
4099840	4102840	This is almost painfully oversimplified.
4102840	4107960	By the time we get to Heraclitus, fire is more like a metaphor for something which is,
4107960	4112600	in some sense, indescribable because we're talking about the nature of being itself,
4112600	4113600	right?
4113600	4116600	So you have to draw on these metaphors.
4116600	4122520	But Nietzsche says that Heraclitus is significant because he rejects being.
4122520	4125880	There is nothing of which we can say it is.
4125880	4129400	Duration is an illusion.
4129400	4135280	Rejecting Annex Cemetery's idea that injustice is done by things coming into being and that
4135280	4142920	the injustice is remedied when they pass away, Heraclitus says on the contrary, strife is justice.
4142920	4147800	Rather than Annex Cemetery's indefinite, which is a separate thing from all the individual
4147800	4155680	monads experiencing time and separate existence, the thing in itself for Heraclitus is the
4155680	4158720	world of becoming in which we all live.
4158720	4163240	Arising and passing away is the definite quality of existence.
4163240	4167760	The nature of reality is revealed in how things arise and pass away, rather than concealed
4167760	4169000	by that fact.
4169000	4175840	We don't hide a timeless reality behind things, but rather this world of absolute impermanence
4175840	4180080	is itself the ultimate reality, that's the Heraclitian view.
4180080	4184080	And so there is a definite quality, which is change.
4184080	4187720	Change is eternal and all-encompassing.
4187720	4193960	The scientific associations that Nietzsche draws here with Heraclitus are incredibly fascinating.
4193960	4200480	He invokes a thought experiment of Carl von Beyer concerning pulse rates, and he references
4200480	4204480	the thoughts of von Helmholtz on cosmic timescales also.
4204480	4210600	I'm going to go into the lecture and read a rather long section of this lecture on Heraclitus
4210600	4215520	that is about von Beyer, because I think the only way for the full implications of what
4215520	4220680	Nietzsche is saying to come through is to hear the whole thought experiment as he lays
4220680	4221680	it out.
4221680	4224400	And so, quote,
4252400	4257560	Well then, since for example the pulse rate among rabbits is four times faster than that
4257560	4262920	among cattle, these will also experience four times as much in the same period, and will
4262920	4269120	be able to carry out four times as many acts of will as cattle, thus in general experiencing
4269120	4271460	four times as much.
4271460	4276840	The inner life of various animal species, including humans, proceeds through the same
4276840	4283760	astronomical time space at different specific rates, and it is according to these that they
4283760	4288760	subjectively and variously judge the fundamental standard of time.
4288760	4294280	For this reason alone, only because for us this fundamental standard is small, does an
4294280	4299200	organic individual, a plant or an animal, appear to us as something remaining at one
4299200	4301760	size and in one shape.
4301760	4307200	For we could observe it one hundred times, or more, in a minute without noticing any
4307200	4310000	external alterations.
4310000	4314600	Well then, we think it very important whether pulse rate, rate of sensation, and the human
4314600	4320480	intellectual process either decelerate or accelerate, since in this way they are fundamentally
4320480	4321480	altered.
4321480	4326800	Assuming that the course of human life, with childhood, maturity, and old age, were reduced
4326800	4331520	by a factor of one one thousandth to one month.
4331520	4336680	When that pulse rate were accelerated one thousand times faster, then we would be able
4336680	4340560	to follow a flying bullet very easily with our vision.
4340560	4346720	If this lifetime were reduced once more by a factor of one one thousandth, limited to
4346720	4351640	some forty minutes, then we would consider the grass and flowers to be something just
4351640	4356600	as absolute and persistent as we now consider the mountains.
4356600	4362000	We would perceive in the growth of a bud as much and as little as a lifetime, like when
4362000	4365760	we think of the geological periods of the earth.
4365760	4370380	We would be totally unable to observe the voluntary movements of animals, for they would
4370380	4372200	be far too slow.
4372200	4378000	At best we could conceive of them as we, in our time frame, think of the heavenly bodies.
4378000	4385080	And with a still further reduction of a lifetime to a scale of one one billionth, the light
4385080	4388960	that we now see would perhaps become audible.
4388960	4392600	Our sounds would become inaudible.
4392600	4397680	When on the other hand, we enormously lengthen and expand a human lifetime, we get quite
4397680	4399320	another picture.
4399320	4403540	Reduce for example pulse rate and sensation threshold by one one thousandth and then our
4403540	4408120	life would last at the upper end eighty thousand years.
4408120	4413880	Then we would experience as much in one year as we do now in eight to nine hours.
4413880	4419440	Then every four hours we would watch winter melts away, the earth thaw out, grass and
4419440	4425760	flowers spring up, trees come into full bloom and bear fruit, and then all vegetation wilt
4425760	4427640	once more.
4427640	4432200	Many developments would not be observed by us at all because of their speed.
4432200	4436800	For example, a mushroom would suddenly sprout up like a fountain.
4436800	4441200	Day and night would alternate like light and shadows in but a moment, and the sun would
4441200	4445160	race along the arch of the heavens in the greatest hurry.
4445160	4449680	Were we to decelerate this lifetime already reduced a thousandfold once again to a scale
4449680	4455240	of one one millionth, a human being would be capable of making only one hundred and eighty
4455240	4457960	nine perceptions in an earth year.
4457960	4461680	The difference between day and night would entirely vanish.
4461680	4467600	The solar ecliptic would appear as a luminous bow across the sky as a glowing coal when
4467600	4473440	swung in a circle appears to form a circle of fire, and vegetation would continually
4473440	4477480	shoot up and vanish in great haste.
4477480	4478840	Enough then.
4478840	4483000	Every shape appearing to us as persistent would vanish in the super haste of events and would
4483000	4486800	be devoured by the wild storm of becoming.
4486800	4491760	Whatever remains, the unmoving proves to be a complete illusion, the result of our human
4491760	4497040	intellect."
4497040	4503800	And so, while Heraclitus philosophizes in such a scattered aphoristic form in which there
4503800	4510080	are so many interpretations and so many ways in which his ideas can be thought of as merely
4510080	4515880	poetic or something like that, Nietzsche sees in Heraclitus' ideas the potential for
4515880	4524000	a new way of thinking about duration, of bringing perspectivism to bear upon the concept
4524000	4527560	of duration and what that does to our cold concept of time.
4527560	4534080	Nietzsche is influenced in this by the Neocontians again and by Schopenhauer, and so far as
4534080	4540360	both of those camps tended to regard time as part of our representation of the world
4540360	4544160	rather than something innate to the thing in itself.
4544320	4550560	In other words, time is something we experience within our little monad of willing, wherein
4550560	4555560	our intellect represents existence to us.
4555560	4558680	But time is part of the representation.
4558680	4562480	It exists at the intersection of our intellect and reality as such.
4562480	4568240	Time in our experience of it is infinitely divisible, as Nietzsche is doing there.
4568240	4570920	Time is infinitely dividing.
4570920	4576480	And as such, our understanding of what time is can't really be separated from our perception
4576480	4578480	of it.
4578480	4581720	Like talking about time outside of the perception of time is a bit difficult.
4581720	4586280	I mean, we can describe it mathematically, of course, but it becomes very difficult to
4586280	4591520	conceive to imagine what we're talking about, right?
4591520	4597000	And so Lange had the following to say about Heraclitus, in which we can see the influence
4597000	4603400	on Nietzsche insofar as Heraclitus fitting into the development of materialism.
4603400	4610760	Quote, the boundless of Annex Cyminder, from which everything precedes, the divine primitive
4610760	4617800	fire of Heraclitus, into which the changing world returns to proceed from it anew, are
4617800	4623120	incarnations of persistent matter," end quote.
4623120	4628520	So use the term boundless there, but he means the indefinite or the apron of Annex Cyminder.
4628520	4636000	So Heraclitus' philosophy, it begins by invoking natural law, the logos.
4636000	4641760	Heraclitus says there's a definite governing quality, a law according to which reality behaves
4641760	4643360	or nature behaves.
4643360	4649280	And in logos, we have some element of intelligence within the essence of the natural world, some
4649280	4657000	quality that, you know, perhaps reminds us of Thales placing a soul within the magnet.
4657000	4662480	And yet we're getting closer to this attempt to perceive a world which is persistent matter
4662480	4669160	and nothing more, existing merely in variegated transformations according to interactions
4669160	4671720	between the different forms of matter.
4671720	4677760	So Lange sees this as a step in the direction of human beings coming to understand matter
4677760	4680240	as being persistent.
4680240	4685200	But all this stuff that Nietzsche brings in with von Baer, comparing him to Heraclitus
4685200	4690680	yet again, once again shows Heraclitus is not somebody who's typically thought of as
4690680	4693720	having scientific notions, right?
4693720	4701240	When he says that duration is essentially an illusion in so many words and that change
4701240	4705160	is eternal, that's not taken as a scientific statement.
4705160	4709440	But the reason why Nietzsche then brings in these scientific thought experiments, which
4709440	4714640	are intensely neocontain, by the way, I mean, if all of our world is a that we experience
4714640	4720160	as a representation, it's, you know, the work of external reality interacting with
4720160	4725720	our sense organs, then other beings who have other sense organs or a different physiology,
4725720	4730880	a different pulse rate might be living in a different representation, so to speak, a
4730880	4732520	whole different world.
4732520	4738160	And so following from those neocontain principles, and those ideas about time that we talked
4738160	4748120	about, Nietzsche comes to compare the, you know, somewhat obscure sayings of Heraclitus
4748120	4753280	as scientific notions yet again, it's very fascinating.
4753280	4757200	So we're going to gloss over parminides next.
4757200	4764280	And this is Nietzsche sees parminides and xenophonies as a dead end in the development
4764280	4767000	of pre-plotonic philosophy.
4767000	4774520	And now Nietzsche does see parminides as possessing a mastery of abstract thought, and he has
4774520	4779920	to master abstract thought in order to assert his central idea, which in parminides case,
4779920	4785000	just to give a quick version, there's only one thing you can say, and that is the declaration
4785000	4792080	of the existence of being that it is the only thing you can sensibly say about being.
4792080	4796840	And so of course, in parminides case, it's not that duration is an illusion, it's that
4796840	4804000	motion is an illusion, and that if anything, change is the illusion and duration is the
4804000	4806640	only reality.
4806640	4811420	Parminides is not a main figure in Nietzsche's eyes, though, and he says further in a letter
4811420	4819620	to road, he considers parminides a great false step in the interpretations of pre-plotonic
4819620	4822140	philosophers.
4822140	4828060	So here's Whitlock, I've abridged this quotation a little bit, but he describes an important
4828060	4834700	difference between the thought of Nietzsche and the thought of Lange and it concerns parminides.
4834700	4838900	Parminides claimed the abstract oneness of all being.
4838900	4844380	His assumption was that our human intellect is the measure of all things.
4844380	4848860	Becoming therefore belongs among illusions of the senses.
4848860	4855220	Nietzsche called this twist of thought the most dangerous of all false paths.
4855220	4861300	Lange considered parminidean being to be a doctrine basic to, but not identical with,
4861300	4863540	materialistic atomism.
4863540	4870600	Lange considered the atomists to be pluralists, and parminides and heraclitus to be monists.
4870600	4877260	He ultimately considered parminides to be the least substantive and fruitful of the pre-plotonics.
4877260	4884220	Parminides' idea of the senses as delusion led into an epistemological cul-de-sac.
4884220	4892380	He should not be thought of as a philosopher of nature or physicist at all.
4892540	4896740	In light of this, we're also going to skip past Zeno with his famous paradox.
4896740	4902700	He's part of the same school of thought as parminides, although granted he had an impact
4902700	4907060	on the development of the dialectic and the discussion of problems inherent to these
4907060	4910780	current conceptions of space-time and motion.
4910780	4915740	The main problem Nietzsche has here is that he sees Xenophonies, parminides, and Zeno
4915740	4920700	as essentially being anti-naturalists.
4920700	4924380	We could spend more time talking about the nuances of them here, but we're not going
4924380	4928860	to go over every last figure, so we're just going to skip ahead.
4928860	4932620	The interest of time and just the fact that if we're giving it from Nietzsche's point
4932620	4938140	of view, he thinks these are a dead end.
4938140	4944180	Anaxagoras is a pivotal figure for Nietzsche who would come next.
4944180	4951900	In the character of Anaxagoras, we see definitively that the string of figures each attempting
4951900	4957380	to describe the nature of the material world were not simply engaging in idle speculation,
4957380	4960380	but following a dialectic.
4960380	4966340	Anaxagoras is a great exemplar of how in the pre-plotonic philosophers we find many
4966340	4971660	of the same conclusions, concepts, or frames of thought that would be rediscovered in later
4971660	4976100	eras, such as during the Enlightenment of Europe.
4976100	4980980	Nietzsche interprets Anaxagoras as having discovered the concept of the conservation
4980980	4991620	of matter, which Longa saw a first inkling of that within Heraclitus and Anaximander.
4991620	4998620	Conservation of mass is a principle we use in physics to this very day, obviously.
4998620	5003660	This holds that matter is indestructible, and it simply changes form.
5003660	5009140	We get a great leap here, and it happens with help from the Iliadics.
5009140	5016780	The properties which were formerly assigned to being, and which are associated, we might
5016780	5024700	say especially associated with being among Xeno and Parmenides, that being is indestructible.
5024700	5030380	This is now applied to becoming, to the matter that makes up the physical world in which
5030380	5033540	we live.
5033540	5041980	Anaxagoras revises the hypothesis of Anaximander, the idea of the Aipuron, the indefinite, the
5041980	5044860	thing in itself.
5044860	5051980	He says that instead the unlimited is a mixture of all qualities, it's not a quality-less
5051980	5052980	matter.
5052980	5054620	It's a mixture of all of them.
5054620	5060900	For Anaxagoras, the fundamental reality contains the seeds of all things that exist.
5060900	5064940	That gets over the problem of how do you get things with qualities from a quality-less
5064940	5065940	thing in itself?
5065940	5068980	Let's get rid of the quality-less thing.
5068980	5074180	Where Anaxagoras differs with the Iliadics, he doesn't hold to their view of the oneness
5074180	5076620	of being.
5076620	5080620	Anaxagoras is, in all things, a philosopher of multiplicity.
5080620	5087780	Whitlock writes of him, quote, between Anaxagoras and the Iliadics, Nietzsche argues, existed
5087780	5089980	a great disjunction.
5089980	5095420	Either the Iliadics were correct that being is one, and the many, along with motion, do
5095420	5097460	not exist.
5097460	5103580	Or Anaxagoras was right, and there are infinitely many beings in motion.
5103580	5109980	Anaxagoras transferred the properties of Iliadic being to his beings.
5110300	5115100	And so, singular being to being's plural.
5115100	5120260	So in Anaxagoras, we have a further refinement of materialism, further progress in explaining
5120260	5123580	all the movement of matter according to the fewest laws.
5123580	5127500	The principles he uses are mixing and separating.
5127500	5131940	So in the picture he gives us, there are infinitely many beings.
5131940	5138060	They emerge from an initial unlimited which contains all the potential qualities, and
5138060	5143180	then they behave according to these two fundamental behaviors of mixing and separating.
5143180	5146740	Not being created or destroyed themselves, these units of matter, but simply combining
5146740	5151140	and recombining according to mechanistic principles.
5151140	5156980	Anaxagoras only appeals to some sort of intellect to explain the workings of these processes
5156980	5160460	when his account of mixing and separating can't explain the effect.
5160460	5164060	So there's still a god of the gaps here, right, in the form of the noose, you know,
5164060	5165060	the intellect.
5165060	5168500	It's an element which is still very much necessary.
5168500	5177820	But rather than being all-encompassing, as in the Heraclitian idea of, like, say, logos,
5177820	5184660	here intellect is only used as a last necessity, some sort of divine intellect in the system.
5184660	5191020	Anaxagoras is expressing this will to, as much as possible, interpret physical phenomena
5191140	5195580	as governed by non-intelligent mechanistic processes.
5195580	5200060	And so that's a further step on the road of materialism.
5200060	5208060	But of course, a dualism still remains here, because that's one of the things that philosophy,
5208060	5213340	that science, has to overcome, right, that Longus says it has to overcome.
5213340	5217420	So we simply have a more refined dualism, but it exists.
5217420	5223180	Now we have this old problem that you have motion, spirited motion, which is found in
5223180	5231420	organic life, us, animation, right, and then you have the motion of non-living objects.
5231420	5234260	This still exists in Anaxagoras.
5234260	5239900	And so then we come to the question of mechanical versus non-mechanical motion.
5239900	5244500	And the question, can one's philosophical system include both?
5244500	5246740	Is it permitted to include both?
5246740	5255380	And so this dualism naturally must be answered, and the next person in the dialectic to answer
5255380	5258380	it is Empedocles.
5258380	5265340	Empedocles is a very interesting figure, because he wavered between science and magic, is how
5265340	5268580	he's described by many people.
5268580	5274420	Nietzsche describes him, he's a man living on the edge of reason and irrational passions.
5274420	5281620	Dabbles in poetry and rhetoric are science, religion, oratory, politics.
5281620	5288300	His significance to our inquiry here is that Empedocles introduces the idea of an original
5288300	5296660	non-mechanical motion, a first cause which sets all mechanical motion into play, thus
5296660	5299420	resolving the dualism, right?
5299420	5304340	This type of argument still employed today in theology, in the form of the first cause
5304340	5306820	argument for God, right?
5306820	5308340	Personal being within intelligence.
5308340	5312740	So even though there are the laws of physics, which mean that angels aren't individually
5312740	5319500	pushing planets around, the first cause that is God set everything into motion, after which
5319500	5323220	all the mechanical laws of the universe can then govern everything.
5323220	5327460	They don't need intelligence managing it at every moment.
5327460	5333420	But so we get this theological argument today, which we can say we find some form of it or
5333420	5341160	like say it's indirectly inherited from Empedocles, and his particular attempts in this struggling
5341160	5344920	towards bringing our world picture into the light of reason.
5344920	5349780	But Empedocles, of course, has these two sides to him, so he also introduces something which,
5349780	5354900	in its modern form, is usually considered as one of the opening salvos against religious
5354900	5357260	thought.
5357260	5363580	Empedocles developed an idea of natural selection, forms which arise by chance, but which are
5363580	5367860	shaped or selected for based on conditions.
5367860	5375220	Schopenhauer had recognized in his writings that Empedocles saw in plant and animal life
5375220	5378860	an inner dwelling desire.
5378860	5384340	Schopenhauer believed that this was akin to his own theory, that the inner character
5384340	5391300	of all things is will, and he considered Empedocles as a forerunner to his own philosophy, as it's
5391300	5395700	given in world as will and representation.
5395700	5401540	More interestingly, for our examination, we might consider how Nietzsche believed Empedocles
5401540	5408020	to correlate in some sense with Darwin on this basis, in the same way that Thales correlates
5408020	5412780	with Lovacier or Heraclitus with Van Baer.
5412780	5420740	And so Nietzsche once again shows his influence from Friedrich Lange, who wrote in his History
5420740	5423100	of Materialism, quote,
5423100	5430620	What Darwin, relying upon a wide extent of positive knowledge, has achieved for our generation.
5430620	5433620	Empedocles offered to the thinkers of antiquity.
5433620	5439820	The simple and penetrating thought that adaptations preponderate in nature just because it is in
5439820	5447140	their nature to perpetuate themselves, while what fails of adaptation has long since perished.
5447140	5450140	End quote.
5450140	5457700	Of course, neither Nietzsche nor Lange could consider someone like Empedocles to be a materialist.
5457700	5459300	He's really not anything close.
5459300	5463980	But Empedocles holds to view like the oneness of all things, and he believes that existence
5463980	5465980	is a form of punishment.
5465980	5473060	The strife endured within existence is the satisfaction of a kind of moral recompense.
5473060	5478100	So we can see the precedent for those beliefs in an X-emender, for example, and how they're
5478100	5482340	getting carried on and those moral ideas are developing as well.
5482340	5486740	And so that's perhaps one of these pitfalls of your science and your philosophy being
5486740	5493020	unified, right, is that as you have this dialectic pushing towards materialism, there's also
5493020	5496500	all this junk that's collecting.
5496500	5504220	But Empedocles also sees these totally non-mechanistic forces of love and hate sort of governing existence,
5504220	5511140	which means that Empedocles' overall understanding of the universe is not materialistic at all.
5511140	5516420	Nevertheless, he's still very important because Nietzsche's knowledge of Schopenhauer and
5516420	5524220	Schopenhauer's comments on Empedocles probably helped broaden Nietzsche's understanding of
5524220	5526140	Empedocles' significance.
5526140	5532980	Because in addition to his point of comparison with Darwin, he can be helpful to Nietzsche
5532980	5540380	in introducing that conception that's akin to the will, the will that Nietzsche is sort
5540380	5547740	of using to explain the entire drive towards scientific knowledge.
5547740	5553860	This is the point of the story when that explanation that Nietzsche is using to explain the drive
5553860	5558860	to scientific knowledge is discovered by that same drive to scientific knowledge, right?
5558860	5565380	And so the inner dwelling desire, this driving that exists in all things, which Schopenhauer
5565380	5569500	associates with his own conception of the will is then carried over into Nietzsche's
5569500	5570500	interpretation.
5570500	5577540	We'll look at a Whitlock summary of Empedocles' significance here, and Whitlock sets up, I
5577540	5583560	think, the implications for us in terms of understanding how this is such a secret beginning
5583560	5590220	to Nietzsche's philosophizing and how Nietzsche picked up things from his examination of materialism
5590220	5595820	arising in Greece that would inform ideas throughout his whole career.
5595820	5600420	So here's Whitlock, and I've abridged this reading yet again, quote.
5600420	5605820	In this lecture series, the evolution of Nietzsche's theory of the will is most pronounced
5605820	5614580	in the discussions of Anneximander, Heraclitus, Annexagoras, Empedocles, and the Atomists.
5614580	5619460	Empedocles took a crucial step toward Newton, Leibniz, and Boskovich.
5619460	5627100	For the philosopher from Agregentum approached the world as force and matter.
5627100	5634500	Nietzsche connects the notion of an inner drive, tribe, with the notion of a primal power,
5634500	5637400	mocked of motion.
5637400	5642740	These are likewise connected to the notion of force, craft.
5642740	5650420	All these were crucial steps toward a theory of the will to power, Vilizumacht.
5650420	5654300	The notion of an inner drive is the Schopenhauerian will.
5654300	5659100	Rather than love, strife is its dynamic quality.
5659100	5664420	A great failure of Empedocles was his inability to overcome teleology.
5664420	5667980	His ordered universe arose from mind.
5667980	5673460	Nietzsche's profoundly anti-teleological thinking demanded a repudiation of natural
5673460	5677340	purpose in the Aristotelian sense.
5677340	5682780	Materialism presupposes such a rejection of teleology, so that Empedocles was ultimately
5682780	5684700	not a materialist.
5684700	5689660	It would be left to Democritus to combine all the necessary elements of materialism
5689660	5695220	into one system.
5695220	5701500	Here we are so far as that Nietzsche, guided by Longa, as well as Ubreveg, Schopenhauer,
5701500	5708700	even Zeller, looks at each figure as a fascinating personality, offering a wholly unique philosophical
5708700	5714740	type, and yet together the pre-Platonics bring forth the development of a purely materialistic
5714740	5720660	world picture, and we might think of how scientists and philosophers in the Enlightenment, which
5720660	5725180	Nietzsche is standing at the end of in his own time, some people say were still in the
5725180	5730300	Enlightenment now, but I would say at the end of like the Romanticist sort of rebellion
5730300	5735980	against a lot of the Enlightenment thinking, and then the transition into the modernity
5735980	5740220	and the world wars, I don't know for exactly the same spirit of the Enlightenment that
5740220	5748340	we were, but however you want to say it, Nietzsche is much closer to that period, and
5748340	5753660	we might think of how those scientists, they emerged from a similar period of ignorance
5753660	5759540	and dogmatism, where the intellect was ruled by Aristotelian notions and by theological
5759540	5766620	prejudices, and it dawned on Nietzsche that the European mind once again had to proceed
5766620	5773720	out of this dualistic, personified, superstitious understanding of how the world functions,
5773720	5779460	and was now driving towards more and more mechanistic and material explanations, and
5779460	5785340	that this same pattern is what the prepletonics had done, but Empedocles is still thinking
5785340	5791660	teleologically, which is sort of the last thing to get over.
5791660	5795900	Now it could also be argued Nietzsche has all the raw material for will to power and
5795900	5801460	the prepletonics that he's discussed, and what is will to power?
5801460	5807540	I don't mean what is the actual will to power, the actual content, I'm saying like what is
5807540	5809900	Nietzsche doing when he comes up with the theory of will to power?
5809900	5816660	I mean, Nietzsche's theory of will to power is his attempt to explain the world with as
5816660	5823680	few laws as possible, with one law that governs existence, so we must consider the possibility
5823680	5830540	that will to power for Nietzsche is not just a metaethical principle, it's not just a psychological
5830540	5836400	principle, it's a scary thought, you know, scary for those of us who have safely compartmentalized
5836420	5841980	the grandiose claims about will to power into being, you know, purely psychological statements,
5841980	5842980	right?
5842980	5849540	It's a scary thought that will to power may have started, may have originated as an attempt
5849540	5854140	by Nietzsche to philosophize in the manner of the prepletonics.
5854140	5860380	Nietzsche's attempt to craft a world picture that unifies both science and philosophy and
5860380	5871280	explains the material world by by means of matter and the use of a single principle.
5871280	5876560	Now with democratists, it's the last figure we'll consider among the prepletonics, and
5876560	5883440	it's the climatic part of the lecture where we finally have a complete materialistic theory.
5883440	5887440	And this doesn't mean that democratists has solved all the questions in physics, right?
5887440	5892860	It means that with democratists, we have a view of the world in which no intelligence
5892860	5899500	or personified spiritual forces or dualism is necessary.
5899500	5902580	Democratists gives us a theory of the atom.
5902580	5906580	We get the word atom from democratists.
5906580	5909980	And so he says, all things are made of atoms.
5909980	5917420	And we can see how this develops out of the work of Annexagoras, the philosopher of multiplicity,
5917420	5919920	but democratists refines it even further.
5919920	5927080	Democratists defines atoms as the smallest unit of matter, the most fundamental unit from
5927080	5931120	which all other forms are constructed.
5931120	5938480	This is the universe's multiplicity, as Annexagoras describes it, but democratists makes all things
5938480	5941800	nothing but atoms and void.
5941980	5946820	Rather than appealing to a non-mechanistic first cause, or a metaphysical force such
5946820	5953580	as love, democratists sees, as Nietzsche says in his lecture, quote, no chance whatsoever
5953580	5960300	but rather the most rigorous lawfulness, only not according to the laws of reason.
5960300	5966620	Well then, democratists derives all motion from empty space and weight, or mass, the
5966620	5969780	German word is Schwer.
5969780	5977360	Many atoms sink down and drive the smaller ones upward by pressure, end quote.
5977360	5982880	Whitlock summarizes Nietzsche's overall assessment of democratists, quoting in an abridged form
5982880	5989120	here, quote, the lectures on democratists and the late Pythagoreans are the dialectical
5989120	5994520	culmination of the lecture series, for they arrive at a mathematical atomism, the most
5994520	6001060	powerful of the ancient systems and the inner expression of will the Greeks had to explicate.
6001060	6006420	This lecture also clearly shows Nietzsche rejecting Schopenhauer's old worn out objections
6006420	6012860	to materialism, an enthusiastic favor of materialistic atomism.
6012860	6016420	Though reading between the lines reveals that Nietzsche was simultaneously developing his
6016420	6022780	own theory of will within this materialistic atomistic discourse, the lecturer does not
6022800	6029640	hesitate to announce that atomism is quote, the truth for us, end quote.
6029640	6035520	And what Whitlock quotes immediately afterwards is something that I'll just read, it's from
6035520	6044240	back in the lecture, because it shows how Nietzsche sort of identifies with democratists
6044240	6051480	here at the end, quote, materialism is a worthwhile hypothesis of relativity and truth.
6051480	6057700	Accordingly, all is false has been discovered to be an illuminating notion for natural science.
6057700	6065020	We still consider then all its results to be truth for us, albeit not absolute.
6065020	6073860	It is precisely our world in whose production we are constantly engaged, end quote.
6073860	6078900	And so in these remarks that will be perhaps frustrating for the epistemological realists
6078900	6086120	out there, Nietzsche again tells us something useful about the way that he thinks.
6086120	6090000	There's a general attitude at this point in his career that's inherited from the Neocontians
6090000	6092920	that we live in a world of representations.
6092920	6098640	That reality as we experience it is not an objective mind independent reality.
6098640	6102480	Now this doesn't mean there's no external reality, Nietzsche criticizes that idea in
6102480	6108260	Beyond Good and Evil simply by saying our sense organs are not themselves representations
6108260	6111340	of our organs that would be absurd.
6111340	6118060	Nevertheless, as the neuroscientist and noted reality skeptic David Hoffman has said, when
6118060	6122180	we look at the neuron, you know, at a neuron of the brain, for instance, even through an
6122180	6127380	electron microscope, we're still just looking at a pixel.
6127380	6132140	The neuron as we see it is a representation of something in the external world that our
6132160	6134320	brain is creating.
6134320	6137000	We live in our nervous systems, right?
6137000	6142760	We can break down the pixel into infinitely smaller pixels, but it's still just all pixels.
6142760	6147760	It's a symbolical representation for something with which we have no direct experience.
6147760	6151080	And so that's Nietzsche's mindset epistemologically.
6151080	6154920	And it's interesting how his thought did develop on this as he went on.
6154920	6159000	But at the time of these lectures, I think this is the world Nietzsche is living in.
6159000	6164860	And I think in that mindset, we can see the sense in what he's saying that mathematical
6164860	6169220	atomism is the most refined form of materialism.
6169220	6173380	And that's true for both the Greeks and for those in Nietzsche's time.
6173380	6177020	And even though the state of science in Europe was far more advanced than it had been during
6177020	6184420	the time of the pre-platonics, Nietzsche's argument here is really one more of philosophy
6184420	6186760	of science than of a scientific nature itself.
6186760	6192360	That democratists coming from a time when science and philosophy were unified brings
6192360	6197600	about the dawning of a new mindset and a new view of the world.
6197600	6203480	And now that our science and our philosophy are seen as separate things, we perhaps don't
6203480	6209640	see the ways in which scientific knowledge or scientific hypotheses carry with them this
6209640	6212880	shift in our view of reality.
6212880	6218180	We live in an atomistic world these days, just as democratists did.
6218180	6225500	That we think of our reality as consisting of particles, of smaller building blocks governed
6225500	6230940	by physical laws, which are non-personal, non-intelligent, mechanistic.
6230940	6235660	We live today in a democratian world.
6235660	6241500	And I think that's what Nietzsche is pointing to about how this is the truth for us when
6241500	6250600	we behold democratists, we're seeing somebody who has come around to the same worldview that
6250600	6253720	we have come around to.
6253720	6259480	And so the narrative Nietzsche discovers is what I've called, as the title of the episode,
6259480	6262160	the descent into materialism.
6262160	6269000	It's an archetypal narrative, almost, of how the arising of philosophy, the cultivation
6269000	6275220	of this useless knowledge, this wisdom that endeavors to bound the boundless, state clearly
6275220	6278460	all that is obscured and secret in the world.
6278460	6282580	This necessarily arises hand in hand with science.
6282580	6288620	It inevitably represents an ever stronger tendency toward materialism.
6288620	6296460	And the final form of this is atomism, which we get to a democratist or in Nietzsche's
6296460	6297460	own time.
6297460	6301120	I would argue we still tend to think about things that way today.
6301120	6308480	Nietzsche therefore reinterprets the significance of science in accord with his own cyclical
6308480	6309840	ideas of time.
6309840	6314200	He sees the same phenomenon in ancient Greece as in Enlightenment Europe, because both are
6314200	6322120	expressions of the same underlying will, even though the details, the conditions are different.
6322120	6326320	But the will drives us to the same ends, because it's the same thing fundamentally in Nietzsche
6326340	6329220	incarnation.
6329220	6333900	And so I think it's best to describe this as a descent as well.
6333900	6339340	And I intend this in both the positive and the negative connotations, because on the
6339340	6343820	positive side of things, the pre-plotonics initiate this project of Greek philosophy
6343820	6348300	out of a will to bring the Greek psyche down to earth.
6348300	6353940	To take us out of flighty abstractions, take us away from that mystified gaze up to the
6353960	6360160	personified heavens, the psychodrama that the Greeks saw in the stars, and instead look
6360160	6365200	to the smallest, most mundane things and take joy in understanding them.
6365200	6371800	This turn of our perspective inevitably leads us to learn the patterns by which things on
6371800	6372800	earth behave.
6372800	6379720	And we begin to explain the world less and less by recourse of reaching up into the clouds,
6379740	6384340	until finally with Democritus, we can explain the world without reaching into mythology
6384340	6387060	at all.
6387060	6391820	But there's a negative side, and there's a negative sense to the word descent, that
6391820	6397660	this descent into materialism is also a descent into nihilism.
6397660	6402660	We discussed this in the episode we just did on nihilism, and it's what Nietzsche called
6402660	6405500	the problem of science in so many words.
6405500	6411280	It achieves its final form, so to speak, in the figure to follow Democritus and the later
6411280	6415480	Pythagoreans, who was Socrates.
6415480	6420080	He's who basically comes next in the dialogue, the mystagogue of science, the man who made
6420080	6426280	reason a universal and binding principle, waged war on all the dogmas and superstitions
6426280	6427600	and illusions.
6427600	6433040	Science becomes this totalizing force, even when it threatens the preservation or the expansion
6433040	6434200	of life.
6434220	6439180	And so here too, in this early philological study, Nietzsche finds one of the central
6439180	6443820	questions and the problems that concerned his whole career.
6443820	6449420	Nietzsche, at this time, he places himself in the milieu of the prepletonics and their
6449420	6456700	quest for a materialist world picture, and influenced as he is by Longa, who is a materialist,
6456700	6461620	Nietzsche considers the creation of a purely materialist worldview as a form of triumph,
6461620	6469080	but he nevertheless has begun to see where materialism will inexorably lead, in life
6469080	6475160	being sacrificed to the truth, and this arrives with the figure of Socrates.
6475160	6482800	And so, you know, this project really becomes, how can this tragic end to the development
6482800	6486880	of philosophy be overcome or dealt with?
6486880	6492140	That's like a central project of Nietzsche's, but that all begins here.
6492140	6498220	All right, so that's it, we're going to do a similar subject matter next week, we're
6498220	6503480	going to actually continue with a lot of the same text, but we're going to, we barely
6503480	6508320	touched on Democritus, and he's in fact so significant to later Nietzsche, in parallel
6508320	6511380	with another figure, Boskovich.
6511380	6515060	So we're going to spend the next episode talking about these two people, they're scientists
6515060	6516460	and philosophers of science.
6516460	6520440	One ancient and one sort of like, I guess you'd say, pre-modern, it's Democritus
6520440	6524880	and Boskovich, and Schopenhauer and Spinoza I think will make appearances to you, special
6524880	6528100	guest appearances.
6528100	6531560	Because what comes out of this, which we've only barely touched on, is an attempt at a
6531560	6534440	scientific theory to the will to power.
6534440	6539880	And so, the next episode is all about that, the world as will to power, and nothing besides.
6539880	6544080	So I'm excited, we're getting into, I like that we've gotten into more obscure stuff
6544100	6553260	now, and I guess this was another long episode, but you know, it's just gotta go until it's
6553260	6555020	finished, I guess.
6555020	6558580	Alright, so join me again next week, y'all.
6558580	6561580	Alright, signing off.
6561580	6568900	Quote, of all the more ancient systems, the Democritian is of the greatest consequence.
6568900	6573500	The most rigorous necessity is presupposed in all things.
6573500	6577800	There are no sudden or strange violations of nature's course.
6577800	6586040	Now for the first time, the collective anthropomorphic mythic view of the world has been overcome.
6586040	6592520	Now for the first time, do we have a rigorous scientific useful hypothesis?
6592520	6597240	As such, materialism has always been of the greatest utility.
6597240	6600560	It is the most down-to-earth point of view.
6600560	6605980	It proceeds from real properties of matter, and it does not indifferently leave out the
6605980	6613740	simplest forces, as is done by accounts of mind, or that of final ends by Aristotle.
6613740	6619820	It is a grand idea, this entire world of order and purposiveness, of countless qualities
6619820	6626540	to be traced back to externalizations of one force of the most basic sort.
6626540	6633940	Matter, moving itself according to general laws, produces a blind, mechanistic result,
6633940	6639240	which appears to be the outline of a highest wisdom.
6639240	6641180	End quote.
6641180	6648280	That was Nietzsche from his lecture on Democritus in the pre-plotonic lecture series.
6648280	6654200	Democritus was the philosopher of ancient Greece who coined the term Adam, for the concept
6654200	6657180	of the smallest unit of matter.
6657180	6662300	Democritus asserted that all matter was made up of forms constructed of smaller units,
6662300	6665060	and the smallest of these were atoms.
6665060	6671820	Through strictly naturalistic processes, atoms interact, and from a totally blind nature
6671820	6677140	we get all of the movements and emergent phenomena that we experience in reality.
6677140	6682420	And so here we see, in Nietzsche's estimation, the significance of Democritus, the first
6682440	6689240	truly materialistic or purely materialistic natural philosopher, who overcomes all of
6689240	6693560	these mythic personifications of the world, and all of these appeals to a non-mechanistic
6693560	6700200	first cause, or metaphysical forces such as love or hate, such as what had been introduced
6700200	6703360	by previous figures in their explanations of the world.
6703360	6709760	Democritus doesn't have to introduce a moral or metaphysical element to explain existence,
6709900	6712740	as, for example, Empedocles did before him.
6712740	6718380	He does not have to appeal to Noose, the element of there being some underlying intellect governing
6718380	6725380	the world, as we see in, for example, Annexagoras, who also preceded Democritus.
6725660	6732660	Annexagoras sometimes has to invoke a divine intellect as an explanation, even though he
6732880	6738120	was driving, along with the other pre-plotonic philosophers, towards this sort of methodological
6738120	6740520	materialism.
6740520	6747520	In Democritus, as Nietzsche interprets him, the Greeks reach a zenith of materialism,
6748360	6754120	and this is what he designates as a mathematical atomism.
6754120	6759400	In this, all qualitative descriptions can be put into quantities.
6759400	6764260	All movement of the universe occurs without the need of an intelligence, and this opens
6764260	6770180	up the possibility for science to branch off down its various paths.
6770180	6774220	Nietzsche here acknowledges the power, the utility of atomism as a framework for understanding
6774220	6779380	the world, and he believes that atomism is the direction in which the science of his
6779380	6782500	own day was proceeding.
6782500	6788700	But notice another element in Nietzsche's words about Democritus, something he sees
6788760	6792720	in Democritus is very fascinating in light of Nietzsche's own ideas, which he would
6792720	6798200	not fully describe until much later in his career.
6798200	6802740	He clearly shows an interest in the grand idea, as he calls it, of an entire world being
6802740	6809240	called forth in all of its infinite complexities from a single force.
6809240	6814480	Indeed, throughout the pre-plotonic lectures, Nietzsche believes that the Greek drive to
6814500	6821500	philosophy revealed that underlying the philosophical project is a will to bound the world within
6824200	6827620	as few first principles as possible.
6827620	6831600	The zenith of that attempt is therefore a single principle.
6831600	6835960	This was the task of the philosopher in the days of the pre-plotonics, when science and
6835960	6842460	philosophy were still unified to explain reality by as few possible laws.
6842460	6847920	And so can Nietzsche dare to undertake such a task in his own time, of finding a single
6847920	6852460	force to explain the entirety of existence, from which all the other principles can be
6852460	6853460	derived.
6853460	6859900	Think the spark of that idea occurs here, and note again that this is a materialist endeavor
6859900	6860900	for Nietzsche.
6860900	6867900	He does not conceive of this quest as in itself necessarily metaphysical, because like Democritus,
6867900	6873660	he does not reach into the heavens for explanations wherever there is a gap, but rather attempts
6873660	6878220	to explain the physical solely by means of the physical.
6878220	6882500	Nietzsche's own attempt culminates with the concept of will to power.
6882500	6887820	Will to power is the single principle, formula, law, or force, whatever we want to call it,
6887820	6891380	by which Nietzsche will attempt to explain the entire world.
6891380	6896580	And while will to power need not be taken to this level, of this kind of perspective
6896580	6902300	on it in order to be useful, I mean many people employ will to power simply as an ethical
6902300	6907460	or psychological principle, including myself in many ways.
6907460	6915300	But this strange intersection of will to power with the explanations for the physical world
6915300	6917980	is in the backdrop of Nietzsche's philosophy.
6917980	6924580	And it's tied in with his odd theories of time and with his notion of the eternal recurrence.
6924580	6930980	And it's been argued that will to power therefore first emerges for Nietzsche not in a moral
6930980	6939860	or psychological aspect, but while he's in the process of examining scientific ideas.
6939860	6945780	And you know, insofar as we may say that science itself is doing ontology, that's what he's
6945780	6946780	doing, right?
6946780	6951260	So if we've abandoned the true world and we believe the ontological reality to be the
6951260	6958540	material world that we all live in, in that sense you could say that Nietzsche is talking
6958540	6962580	about will to power as a sort of ontological force.
6962580	6967180	This idea comes with a million caveats, of course, and for all of those you can listen
6967180	6969900	to the preceding episodes of the podcast.
6969900	6976020	For today, however, the topic is Nietzsche's scientific influences for the idea of will
6976020	6983260	to power and will to power as an explanatory principle within physics or within the context
6983260	6985820	of thinking about physics.
6985820	6988660	Can we make any sense of will to power in this sense?
6988660	6992060	Does it have any use for us for, you know, today?
6992060	6997860	And can understanding this scientific angle on the will to power give us any insight into
6997860	7004100	the other nuances of Nietzsche's philosophy, and I would say that it does.
7004100	7008540	It's not required that you listen to the previous episode, Descent into Materialism, but I'll
7008540	7012260	just say at this point, you probably will get more out of this one if you listen to
7012260	7018220	that one first, since it gives a lot of context for the way Nietzsche thinks and how his philosophy
7018220	7023740	of science compares and contrasts with previous views of science.
7023740	7029100	But just as a summary, I guess, a brief synopsis, Nietzsche's heavily influenced by neocontine
7029100	7032420	interpretations of the history of science.
7032420	7036860	He draws as much insight from the pre-plotonic philosophers of ancient Greece as he does
7036860	7039420	from contemporary figures.
7039420	7044720	And finally, Nietzsche is himself very much engaged in a dialogue with the sciences and
7044720	7050820	addressing himself to ideas about the philosophy of science proposed by the great philosophers
7050820	7053260	that came before him.
7053260	7056580	And so more than anything, if you didn't listen to that talk, the most important thing to
7056580	7060580	know is that Nietzsche was very much up to date on the developments in the sciences.
7060900	7065740	He was very concerned with the philosophy of science, and rather than being an irrationalist,
7065740	7071300	he sees himself, at least in his early career, as being a scientific materialist.
7071300	7077300	Now, of course, some of his later statements might actually contradict that, but nevertheless,
7077300	7082620	I think that is how he understood his idea of will to power at this point, as coming
7082620	7088420	out of a dialectic between past materialist philosophers of science.
7088420	7093580	And the funny thing here is, I can't call it dialectical materialism, because Marxists
7093580	7096820	have claimed that particular designation.
7096820	7101540	But what we're talking about here is quite literally a dialogue, a dialectical development
7101540	7109380	of a view of the world occurring between materialists in a scientific sense.
7109380	7114740	And we could say that today, almost all scientists are the product of this dialectic, and so
7114740	7119620	far as they're all mostly materialists, at least again, in a methodological sense.
7119620	7126020	Sure, there are some oddballs out there who profess panpsychism and similar things, but
7126020	7130180	in Nietzsche's time, not everyone was materialist.
7130180	7138460	And so that's why it's important to zero in on the fact that it is this materialist branch
7138460	7142740	of neocontain philosophy that's most influential in Nietzsche's thinking here, and that there
7142740	7147900	were actually other options out there at the time.
7147900	7150420	And we'll get into those a little bit as we continue.
7150420	7158460	Again, we find Friedrich Albert Lange, who wrote the History of Materialism, is a key
7158460	7161180	influence on Nietzsche's thought.
7161180	7166260	We talked a lot about Lange last time as sort of guiding Nietzsche through understanding
7166260	7169380	the pre-plotonic philosophers.
7169380	7175180	I thought I'd read some quotations here that more straightforwardly established that link
7175180	7179340	and help support the case for this week's talk, that Democritus of all people would
7179340	7183400	be a main influence on Nietzsche and his will to power idea.
7183400	7187860	But when we examine how Democritus is treated in Lange's work, this interpretation comes
7187860	7189700	together very nicely.
7189700	7196140	So in any case, George J. Stack noted that Nietzsche said that Lange's book, History
7196140	7204060	of Materialism, was a, quote, treasure chest of ideas presented to him, end quote.
7204060	7210300	This recalls Whitehead's phrasing that Plato's work is an inexhaustible mine of suggestion.
7210300	7213460	For Nietzsche, he found that in Lange.
7213460	7220380	And so Nietzsche wrote in 1866, quote, the most significant philosophical work to appear
7220380	7225820	in the last decade is without a doubt Lange, History of Materialism, about which I could
7225820	7231620	write voluminous praise, Kant, Schopenhauer, and this book by Lange.
7231620	7235500	I do not need more than that, end quote.
7235500	7241000	Now of course, Nietzsche would expand beyond those influences such as Kant and Schopenhauer,
7241000	7244780	and he would therefore expand beyond Lange as well.
7244780	7248980	But while Schopenhauer's name, for example, comes up all the time when we talk about Nietzsche's
7248980	7252300	influences, Lange hardly comes up at all.
7252300	7256900	And so that's one of the reasons why I think it's important to emphasize him throughout
7256900	7260940	this sort of detour into Nietzschean science we're doing here at the end of the season,
7260940	7266660	because he's so explanatory of Nietzsche's thinking on this.
7266660	7272100	So again, when it comes to Nietzsche's interpretation of Democritus, Democritus is central to Lange's
7272100	7273100	book.
7273100	7278260	While Lange mentions the other pre-Socratic philosophers, or pre-Platonics as Nietzsche
7278260	7284780	calls them, Democritus gets far more attention from Lange than any other among the pre-Socratics.
7284780	7290420	And as a matter of fact, Lange's book actually begins with a chapter entitled, The Early
7290420	7295060	Atomists, Especially Democritus.
7295060	7299380	Not only does this discussion of Democritus begin the work, but Democritus plays a central
7299380	7303740	role in the entire book for Lange.
7303740	7309420	Lange asserts in that work, quote, the modern atomic theory has been gradually developed
7309420	7313980	from the atomism of Democritus, end quote.
7313980	7316460	Centrality of Democritus is the main pre-Socratic figure.
7316460	7319780	It was sort of shared in the viewpoint of Zeller.
7319780	7322780	We talked a little bit about Zeller last time.
7322780	7328500	He's a semi-Hegelian philologist with whom Nietzsche had some agreements and some disagreements.
7328500	7336620	It's worth noting that for the pre-Platonic lectures, Nietzsche mostly critiques Zeller,
7336620	7341300	but one of the only points of agreement that he finds is that Zeller is aligned with Lange
7341300	7346020	when it comes to understanding the importance of Democritus.
7346020	7350900	And so Democritus is the culmination of the Materials Project in Ancient Greece.
7350900	7356140	He also presents us with another archetypal personality among the pre-Platonic philosophers.
7356140	7360540	So if we'll remember Nietzsche sees, he thinks it's very important that the pre-Platonics
7360540	7367980	emerge at a time before there's a definitive thing such as a school or cast of philosophers.
7367980	7371700	And each of them has to sort of define what it means to be a philosopher on his own.
7371700	7378820	And so he presents all of them as this series of fascinating, unique personalities.
7378820	7382820	And when it comes to Democritus, he's known as the laughing philosopher.
7382820	7386980	He's often contrasted with Heraclitus, the philosopher who was associated with sadness
7386980	7388900	and melancholy.
7388900	7394500	And I personally might question these designations as maybe being a bit anachronistic.
7394500	7400900	But nevertheless, this is the common picture, Democritus is the philosopher who laughs.
7400900	7406180	And perhaps this is because Democritus praises cheerfulness in his own work.
7406180	7412540	And so we have a presentation of a worldview which is, for the first time, scientific and
7412540	7417780	more or less fully liberated from mythology, but this is done cheerfully by someone who
7417780	7422220	meets this entirely material existence with a laugh.
7422220	7428860	And so we cannot help but see something resembling a joyous science within the figure of Democritus.
7428860	7434540	Well, Nietzsche probably got that coinage, the phrase, gay science or joyous science
7434540	7437660	from Emerson.
7437660	7443660	But Nietzsche's admiration for Democritus, for the Democratian approach to life and
7443660	7449000	to knowledge, that may have been one of the influences that sort of led to him to conceive
7449000	7452740	of the concept of such a gay science.
7452740	7458300	And so not only does Nietzsche describe the atomism of Democritus as constituting this
7458300	7463620	most consequential of all ancient theories, but furthermore, we see in Democritus and
7463620	7467180	his forerunner, Lucipus, another innovation.
7467180	7472340	They produce a perspectival theory of human experience in which we might recognize the
7472340	7479220	prefiguration of the sort of phenomena, numinous, split of Kant, which influenced the scientific
7479220	7481140	thinking of the Neocontians.
7481140	7485940	So Democritus' description of thought and of sensation are that images, or we might
7485940	7491740	say representations, affect the body from outside or they stimulate the body from outside
7491740	7496540	if there's an outside stimulus which is then transformed into an image.
7496540	7501820	And that even the basis of thoughts themselves are images or representations, we might say.
7501820	7507340	And so certainly Nietzsche would recognize, he recognizes the kinship here in this picture
7507340	7514180	of cognition with Schopenhauer and the Neocontians, von Helmholtz and Longa.
7514180	7520380	But we must turn to the most consequential aspect of Democritus.
7520380	7525520	What is the atomism of Democritus, the man who gave us the very word atom, which we
7525520	7527840	use to this day?
7527840	7532000	In the atomic theory of Democritus, we have the idea of atoms as indivisible.
7532000	7538400	They're indivisible units, they're the bedrock unit of matter, so naturally they're the point
7538400	7545480	at which particles of matter cannot be divided into any more parts.
7545480	7551480	Different forms of matter are simply different arrangements of atoms or different shapes that
7551480	7554760	exist in different positions in space.
7554760	7560600	These are all constructed of atoms, and when bodies perish, the atoms in them disassemble,
7560600	7566400	but the atoms themselves are not created or destroyed, so we have conservation of matter.
7566400	7572080	And furthermore, Democritus sees atoms as moving entirely in accord with laws governing
7572080	7579480	weight, so they don't undergo, they're completely explained by mechanistic processes, they don't
7579480	7586000	undergo direct contact, and action at a distance does not occur.
7586000	7591640	Now of course, this means there's an inevitable split or separation between what we perceive
7591640	7596680	through the senses and what actually exists, sort of the hallmark of Greek philosophy,
7596680	7597680	right?
7597680	7603200	And that would seem to be required furthermore by the Democritian account of perception and
7603200	7605560	cognition.
7605560	7610680	So if there are these units of matter that are so small, we cannot see them with enough
7610680	7615040	specificity to see the boundaries between them, such a difference between what we perceive
7615040	7618400	and what the world truly is would seem to be required, right?
7618400	7625320	And so nevertheless, we can still say that there's something different has occurred here,
7625320	7630120	though, just to push back on that, that this is not quite the distinction between perception
7630120	7636000	and knowledge of the type held by, say, Plato or the Christians, in which true knowledge
7636000	7641400	of the world sort of reveals forces and principles which transcend the material world.
7641400	7646680	Democritus still holds some methodological materialism, as we've called it.
7646680	7650720	It's merely, you know, the difference between perception and the true world, quote unquote,
7650720	7655640	in the case of Democritus, would be the equivalent in modern times to like the difference between
7655640	7660680	what one sees with their eyes, with the naked eye, versus what one sees through an electron
7660680	7661680	microscope, right?
7661680	7666360	Unless we're going to say that what we see through the microscope constitutes a metaphysical
7666360	7671800	world, which I don't think most people would, then we can excuse Democritus on this.
7671800	7675200	And it's worth noting that later scientific discovery backs up what he said.
7675200	7678600	We do see smaller and smaller building blocks.
7678600	7684240	And so Democritus has been vindicated, although I should say the term used for Adam in the
7684240	7690360	modern day doesn't really correspond to Adam's, as Democritus described them, since the Adam
7690360	7695260	is by definition the smallest possible unit of matter.
7695260	7700440	So once you start talking about subatomic particles, you're using the word in a different
7700440	7705440	way than Democritus would have understood it, right, just by definition there.
7705440	7713560	So furthermore, also, Democritus is not perfect in every sense as a materialist.
7713560	7719480	For example, he permits that between atoms of matter exist atoms of soul, and soul is
7719480	7726000	conceived as a kind of invigorating force, which Whitlock asserts might serve the function
7726000	7732800	of being a prefiguration of the will to power, a prefiguration in the mind of Nietzsche.
7732800	7739120	The atoms of soul are almost more like a field than what we would consider to be solid matter.
7739120	7746880	But remember, materialism doesn't mean that things like energy don't exist.
7746880	7751540	Perhaps we could see the Democritian view as sort of like a low resolution understanding
7751540	7754680	that there has to be some sort of energy in the system.
7754680	7757240	So it's still a material explanation.
7757240	7762280	And the other component in how Nietzsche thinks about will to power scientifically might have
7762280	7767680	been influenced by precursors to field theory, right?
7767680	7772360	And so he's maybe able to interpret Democritus in that way.
7772360	7778880	In any case, Democritus does have to account for mind, and for consciousness, and movement.
7778880	7784680	And what all this ends up being is yet another form of material, of matter.
7784680	7790560	And that's very different from how Heraclitus or Anaxagoras or Empedocles might see something
7790560	7793160	like mind or spirit.
7793160	7799800	And so in a passage from Longa, he expresses this aspect of Democritus as one of the triumphs
7799800	7801480	of his natural philosophy.
7801480	7803880	Longa writes, quote,
7803880	7811000	Democritus regarded mind not as the world-building force, but only as one form of matter amongst
7811000	7812560	others.
7812560	7817700	And this is just Democritus's superiority for every philosophy which seriously attempts
7817700	7822240	to understand the phenomenal world must come back to this point.
7822240	7827880	The special case of those processes we call intellectual must be explained from the universal
7827880	7832120	laws of motion, or we have no explanation at all.
7832120	7837400	But he who devises some bungling explanation of nature, including the rational actions
7837400	7843600	of mankind, starting from mere conjectural, a priori notions, which is it is impossible
7843600	7849240	for the mind to picture intelligibly to itself, destroys the whole basis of science, no matter
7849240	7853240	whether he be called Aristotle or Hegel.
7853240	7859000	Good old Kant would here undoubtedly in principle declare himself on the side of Democritus
7859000	7865240	and against Aristotle and Zeller, end quote.
7865240	7869680	So maybe that passage started out rather clear, but then he starts talking about all these
7869680	7870680	other figures.
7870680	7873320	So let's clarify this passage a little bit.
7873320	7877640	Well, the first thing we might bring up in clarifying the passage further, there's one
7877640	7882440	of Nietzsche's unpublished notes that Whitlock references.
7882440	7888720	But Whitlock references this note without a citation, only to call it overlooked and cryptic,
7888720	7892120	which is funny because he himself overlooked the citation.
7892120	7894040	So I don't know where to find this in Nietzsche's work.
7894040	7898960	But according to Whitlock, Nietzsche wrote that his intellectual heritage is derived
7898960	7906160	from anti-teleological spinosists on the one hand and mechanists on the other.
7906160	7911200	And I think that's justifiably a rather cryptic remark because Nietzsche says he may be understood
7911200	7914280	properly only in this context.
7914280	7919240	And that's a very, you know, on the face of it, that's a strange origin story for Nietzsche's
7919240	7924520	intellectual tradition for he himself to give.
7924520	7928920	I mean, it would probably sound strange to pretty much anyone who hasn't looked into
7928920	7934120	this angle of Nietzsche's thought, his philosophy of science, right?
7934120	7942520	But so when he invokes spinosists, obviously that refers to Spinoza, Baruch Spinoza was
7942520	7946720	a philosopher from the 17th century.
7946720	7952160	He was from Amsterdam, or he lived in Amsterdam, but he was of a Sephardic Jewish origin.
7952160	7955680	And he's one of the leading figures among the rationalists.
7955680	7960560	And he crafted a worldview in which mankind and the world as we know it, and even God
7960560	7963720	are viewed from a sort of naturalistic lens.
7963720	7966160	And Nietzsche had great respect for Spinoza.
7966160	7969560	He called him a precursor to his own ideas.
7969560	7975040	And one similarity we'll immediately see when we compare Nietzsche and Spinoza, for example,
7975040	7980080	is that both reject the existence of free will, at least in the way free will is normally
7980080	7981240	presented.
7981240	7988120	Spinoza's rejection of Descartes' mind-body dualism also aligns Spinoza with Nietzsche's
7988120	7990480	outlook, right?
7990480	7997680	But Spinoza had caused something, he had caused a mighty controversy called either the Spinozist
7997680	8001560	controversy or the Pantheism controversy.
8001560	8009680	This emerges in the German philosophical circles, in the academic and philosophical circles.
8009680	8015680	This is because Spinoza had been a pantheist, and he had thus seen God as the effective
8015680	8017960	force in all things.
8017960	8023480	This picture of the world was therefore naturalistic, but not really materialist, I mean it's dependent
8023480	8026920	on the power of an ever-present divine force.
8026920	8032360	It's less personal in Spinoza's view than the traditional Christian view, something
8032360	8035320	more akin to a force or a field, right?
8035320	8041920	But it's nevertheless associated with God, and as an imminent, all-encompassing divinity.
8041920	8047960	So what came with the popularity of Spinozistic metaphysics in the German intellectual circles
8047960	8054240	was a tendency towards teleologist positions on science.
8054240	8055240	What does that mean?
8055240	8060440	It means, even though there's a genuine attempt to understand the world, via natural law,
8060440	8066960	this is still done within a framework in which the world exists for some purpose.
8066960	8070760	Also, and that's what atelos means, is a purpose.
8070760	8076560	So it's still done within a framework in which the world exists for the sake of some divine
8076560	8083000	force, for the purpose crafted by an absolute mind, or whatever the case might be.
8083000	8087440	And this goes all the way back to Aristotle, a teleology for the world in the Aristotelian
8087440	8090560	sense.
8090560	8095720	It implies that the reality we live in and experience as a contingent reality, subject
8095800	8098280	to some other dominant reality.
8098280	8102760	If this life exists for some purpose or ends, that means there's some other thing whose
8102760	8109760	end it serves, whether that's another world or this imminent divine intellect or whatever.
8109760	8117960	And so that claim of a teleological universe became very popular in Germany, and then there
8117960	8119760	was a backlash to this.
8119760	8125240	There arose an anti-teleologist camp among German intellectuals, and this even included
8125280	8127280	many Spinozists.
8127280	8132880	They took influence from Spinoza's ideas, but nevertheless came down against teleology.
8132880	8140680	And so these are the anti-teleological Spinozists that Nietzsche references.
8140680	8147680	In that quotation we just looked at from Longa, he sort of implies what this divide is.
8147680	8151800	He shows us the divide and who he's talking about, right, between the teleologists and
8151800	8153680	the anti-teleologists.
8153720	8157800	Also he brings up Aristotle, and he groups him together with Hegel.
8157800	8165800	These are examples of thinkers who had teleological explanations of nature, Aristotle's inclusion,
8165800	8171440	rather obvious, Hegel's included here, also rather obviously, Hegel sees life and history
8171440	8173560	as a revelation of the absolute.
8173560	8178720	So for Hegel, life and history, therefore, have a telos, which is the revelation of the
8178720	8183400	absolute mind to itself, or however, you know, I'd love to have a Hague alien on, if anyone
8183440	8188880	knows a good Hague alien, you know, maybe, I don't, I mean, I know of them, right?
8188880	8194640	I know Gizek and things like that, but I don't know any good Hague alien philosophers who
8194640	8196320	are like popular.
8196320	8198000	So if you know one, let me know.
8198000	8200280	But anyway, that's just an aside.
8200280	8207000	So Zeller, for his Hague alienism, he's included as another candidate, as an opposing figure
8207000	8213240	to the worldview of Longa, who comes down on this anti-teleological side, right?
8213240	8221360	So Zeller, as we mentioned, somewhat Hague alien, so he's included with Hegel and Aristotle.
8221360	8226520	Now on the anti-teleologist side, Longa suggests Kant would stand over on his side of the question,
8226520	8232600	on his side of the aisle, and that would also be the side of Democritus.
8232600	8237320	And we could recall the passage we quoted from last week from Kant, where Kant sort
8237320	8242640	of delights in the prospect that one could give him matter and he could give you a world
8242640	8243800	from it, right?
8243800	8248880	That simply applying his reason to understanding the laws and patterns governing matter and
8248880	8254480	its interactions with the world, you could start with the universe in a chaotic, unformed
8254480	8259480	state of just one kind of thing, one kind of matter, one form, a fundamental form of
8259480	8262920	matter and Kant can give you a world out of it, right?
8262920	8266000	That's exactly what Democritus did.
8266000	8275120	So it makes Kant, Democritus, Longa, and yes, Nietzsche in the camp, which is anti-teleological.
8275120	8281680	So Nietzsche, accordingly, in his pre-plutonic lectures, draws the comparison between Democritus
8281680	8283560	and Kant.
8283560	8288400	So and since Longa drew that same comparison, we could conclude this is another thing he
8288400	8296400	possibly gets from Longa, that we might be seeing Longa's influence in that very passage.
8296400	8301680	And so when Nietzsche says in this cryptic note that anti-teleological spinosists are
8301680	8309640	one camp from which he descends intellectually, these would be figures like Longa and Ubreveg,
8309640	8315400	who were influenced by Spinoza, but rejected Spinoza's idea of a telos for the world.
8315400	8319040	And then the other people who would easily say are mechanists, and so we might just say
8319040	8327120	people who would, this would include anyone who has anti-teleological views or methodologically
8327120	8333240	anti-teleological views, especially those who existed even prior to Spinoza, and so figures
8333240	8336560	like Bacon, Kant, and of course, Democritus.
8336560	8341320	And so another quote from Longa puts this even more directly, again, this is from history
8341320	8347440	of materialism, quote, Aristotle complains repeatedly that Democritus, leaving aside
8347440	8352920	teleological causes, had explained everything by a necessity of nature.
8352920	8357880	This is exactly what Bacon praises most strongly in his book on the advancement of learning,
8357880	8358880	end quote.
8358880	8363920	And so of course, Longa agrees with Bacon and not Aristotle.
8363920	8369000	And it demonstrates in the way how Bacon praises Democritus for the very same thing
8369000	8371180	that Aristotle criticizes.
8371180	8376920	It reveals that dichotomy, anti-teleological thinking versus teleological.
8376920	8383160	And so Longa suggests where Democritus may have been lacking, and this I think provides
8383160	8387800	an area in which Nietzsche sees a way that he can innovate.
8387800	8395040	And so Longa writes, quote, of all the great principles underlying materialism in our time,
8395040	8401000	one only is wanting and Democritus, and that is the abolition of all teleology by the principle
8401000	8406480	of the development of the purposeful from the unpurposeful.
8406480	8412640	We find in him no trace of that false teleology, which may be described as the hereditary foe
8412640	8419640	of all science, but we discover nowhere an attempt to explain the origin of these adaptations
8419760	8424520	from the blind sway of natural necessity, end quote.
8424520	8432020	And so Longa argues, the only true refutation of a teleology for the world, you know, the
8432020	8436360	refutation of the world having a purpose and intelligence or like some sort of world-building
8436360	8444200	mind, it would be to show how purpose can arise from purposelessness.
8444200	8448440	Because we as conscious beings, we have minds, we have consciousness.
8448440	8451080	We come up with concepts such as purpose.
8451080	8455560	We create things that do have a telos, and we give a telos to things which we did not
8455560	8456560	even create.
8456560	8461720	So, you know, you craft something like a chair, which has a telos in its very creation, right?
8461720	8468280	The chair is for your sitting, but you could also use a tree stump to sit upon, right?
8468280	8474160	And so it's the fact that we have this mind which not only perceives things, but also imparts
8474160	8480480	a purpose to things according to what we value or need or prefer.
8480480	8485800	And so a materialist understanding is confronted, I mean, in some sense you could reduce it
8485800	8490720	to what we today call the hard problem of consciousness, where you have to account for
8490720	8497840	a mind which invents ideas like purpose, goal, and end, which means your materialist theory
8497840	8503720	ultimately has to take account of values, meaning, right?
8503720	8509680	A naturalistic theory which doesn't reach outside the world of matter that can provide
8509680	8516880	a meaning for mankind, or rather, more precisely, provides an explanation for how meaning arises,
8516880	8520320	where it comes from, why we have a notion of it.
8520320	8525280	And that's, too long ago would be the only acceptable refutation of teleology, or the
8525280	8528240	only effective thing, the only thing that would really do the trick.
8528240	8535280	And so that's an interesting clue, I think, if we take it seriously, as to what Nietzsche's
8535280	8538400	philosophical project becomes aimed at.
8538400	8544160	It's another way of seeing how these questions are opening up for Nietzsche as we keep going
8544160	8545720	here.
8545720	8553960	But by refusing to engage in teleology, admirable as that is, without really giving that explanation
8553960	8561000	that Longus sees as essential, Democritus leaves his theories open to misinterpretation.
8561000	8566160	Democritus believes that nothing is up to random chance, but as Longa notes, his materialist
8566160	8573560	denial of final causes led some to misunderstand Democritus as ultimately preaching just such
8573560	8575840	a belief in chance, right?
8575840	8581840	And so a distinction has to be made between chance and necessity, which Nietzsche sees
8581840	8589760	in Democritus's work, and on that basis sort of uses that to refute the people, refute
8589760	8593880	the interpretation of Democritus as simply believing in random chance by saying he doesn't
8593880	8596760	believe in chance, he believes in necessity.
8596760	8601840	And we could say maybe there's a, Nietzsche can see this in one of his other influences
8601840	8608560	because Schopenhauer made this distinction between basing things on chance and basing
8608640	8612280	things on the principle of sufficient reason.
8612280	8619780	And so Nietzsche also makes this distinction between chance and necessity here, or he's
8619780	8621900	able to see it very clearly.
8621900	8625920	And so through the influence of Longa and Nietzsche, we have a clear battle line, teleology
8625920	8630600	as the opposing force of science, and Longa's main critique of Democritus was that he rejected
8630600	8637800	teleology, but he didn't adequately defeat it, we might say, by accounting for telos naturalistically,
8637800	8642560	or for teloi as we encounter them, or as our minds come up with them.
8642560	8646640	The process of teloi generation, we might say, right?
8646640	8650000	What is the production of telos?
8650000	8651000	Where does that come from?
8651000	8657640	And so Democritus sets the stage for future anti-teleologists, such as Nietzsche, to address
8657640	8659640	this issue.
8659640	8666760	Whitlock writes, quote, Longa and Nietzsche nearly identified teleological reason with
8666760	8669560	religious anthropomorphism.
8669560	8675560	Democritus' atomism rejecting teleology, if incompletely, his intellectual discovery
8675560	8682480	laid the groundwork for the mathematical Pythagoreans, end quote.
8682480	8691520	It's worth saying Nietzsche would later grow out of this position, or out of pure mechanism,
8691520	8692720	we'll say.
8692720	8698120	And it's very subtle, the change in mindset for Nietzsche, but it's difficult to place
8698120	8703520	later Nietzsche within this solidly and completely mechanistic camp.
8703520	8710720	And as his thought matured, he would later critique Longa and Ubreveg as being part of
8710720	8716280	the, quote, Church of Materialism, end quote.
8716280	8721880	And I think it's because Nietzsche eventually becomes skeptical and questions the whole
8721880	8730240	belief and cause and effect, which is, it's like almost a whole other can of worms, right?
8730240	8734880	It's nevertheless still very instructive here, and we're thinking about what started Nietzsche
8734880	8738920	down the road, thinking about many of his later ideas, to consider how the foundation
8738920	8744560	was mechanistic, materialistic, anti-teleological.
8744560	8749440	That's why I would say he starts from a truly atheistic position, and I said he's the first
8749440	8754400	truly atheistic philosopher, or I characterized him that way, like way back in the first
8754400	8757080	episode, as I recall correctly.
8757080	8763240	So now, in discussing the often overlooked significance of Democritus to Nietzsche's
8763240	8769360	philosophy, we have seen how Nietzsche's thought is so deferential to that, Friedrich
8769360	8776960	Albert Longa, that in some sense we can't even really compare the thoughts of the two,
8776960	8780200	because the overlap is near total.
8780200	8786840	But there was an aspect to Nietzsche's thought that went beyond Longa, and that is insofar
8786840	8793720	as he brought in a scientist who was regarded at the time as an obscure, or even a fringe
8793720	8799880	sort of figure, and that's the Croatian physicist, mathematician, and philosopher of
8799880	8804000	science, Roger Josef Boskovich, I believe his name and his native tongue would be like
8804360	8810040	Rogiero, but I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce Croatian, so.
8810040	8817540	He lived and wrote in the 18th century, and his most famous work is published in 1758,
8817540	8823880	Theory of Natural Philosophy, derived from a single law of forces which exist in nature,
8823880	8830320	which contains Boskovich's atomic theory and his theory of forces.
8830320	8834640	Boskovich was attractive to Nietzsche for a reason that would be very obvious in light
8834640	8839480	of our analysis of how Nietzsche has been thinking about the project of science, because
8839480	8848040	Boskovich provided a single equation, a single force for describing how every different manifestation
8848040	8853160	of force expresses itself in the physical world.
8853160	8859400	And so, Boskovich's ideas, they actually did not find a wide purchase at the time when
8859480	8865800	he was writing, but his place in science has been somewhat rejuvenated in recent years.
8865800	8872080	There are some such as Dragoslav Stojlikovic, not exactly sure how to pronounce his name,
8872080	8879560	but he's called Boskovich the father of modern science, and a sort of forerunner to the quantum
8879560	8885600	theory, or quantum physics, and all sorts of things.
8885680	8891440	So, in bringing Boskovich into his thinking, Nietzsche parts ways with many of these figures
8891440	8895200	that we've talked about as being his influences.
8895200	8900000	Boskovich is the final element in Nietzsche's scientific thinking that we haven't yet covered,
8900000	8904040	and with Boskovich's help, Nietzsche goes beyond all his precursors.
8904040	8908920	And Whitlock describes this, and I'm going to quote from his commentary on the lecture
8908920	8912840	in an abridged form, quote,
8939920	8946240	the only reasonable account of the phenomenal world, the problem of motion remains.
8946240	8952400	This is crucial to note, Newton introduced the existence of God to explain the enigma
8952400	8954200	of motion.
8954200	8959560	For this reason, among others, Schopenhauer remarked that science solves enigmas only by
8959560	8962880	introducing occult terms.
8962880	8967840	This agrees with constant action, of the a priori judgment God exists.
8967840	8975200	Nietzsche knew well that motion is a physical enigma with profound metaphysical implications.
8975200	8980920	One of Newton's contemporaries, Roger Boskovich, attempted to solve the enigma of motion outside
8980920	8987480	the framework of Newtonian explanation via the principle of action at a distance.
8987480	8993040	Schopenhauer decried this highly controversial principle as another occult force, whereas
8993040	8999320	Kant saw it as a threat to both God and Newton, and so constructed the architectronic of his
8999320	9004840	system in part as a bulwark against Boskovichian physics.
9004840	9009880	This controversy around Boskovich was itself a dynamic and the larger cultural debate about
9009880	9015200	spinosism, an encroaching materialistic atheism.
9015200	9020800	Boskovich, although a devout Catholic, did not require God to explain motion in his system,
9020800	9022520	as did Newton.
9022520	9028160	For a quite similar reason, Leibnizian monodology was seen as a non-Newtonian alternative to
9028160	9033920	Kantianism that avoided the Boskovichian point-particle system.
9033920	9041200	Uberveg and Lange, following Hemholz, rejected Boskovich, in this way they decisively parted
9041200	9045960	company with Nietzsche.
9046200	9049800	He brings up Leibniz at the end there.
9049800	9051600	We don't need to get into the specifics of that.
9051600	9056280	Just to understand, he's sort of saying that Boskovichian physics was so controversial,
9056280	9062480	so scary to people, because it could explain motion without appeal to God.
9062480	9066520	He alleges basically Kant sees it therefore as a threat to God, into the Newtonian system
9066520	9070200	which appeals to God.
9070200	9075840	Even if you must step outside of Newtonianism, well, here we've got Leibniz over here who
9076600	9078480	don't go to Boskovich, right?
9078480	9081880	There's an alternative to that.
9081880	9085640	Everyone had sort of avoided Boskovich because of this, and Whitlock seems to think that it's
9085640	9091920	because there's this sort of undertone that with Boskovich, even though he's a Catholic,
9091920	9096920	this encroaching materialistic atheism comes with his physics, because of what it has the
9096920	9098440	power to do.
9098440	9103520	Nietzsche became very excited by Boskovichian point-particle theory.
9103560	9110720	Nietzsche's point-particles are not corpuscular atoms, or sorry, corpuscular atoms, as in
9110720	9116320	the Newtonian system, which form the basis of Kant's understanding as well.
9116320	9122720	Kant's matter is Newtonian matter, and it's made of these corpuscular atoms.
9122720	9128880	Corpuscular atoms are extended, they're bodies, we might say.
9128880	9134240	Force points, on the other hand, are non-extended, non-corpuscular.
9134240	9141520	Unlike the Democartian atoms, or Newtonian atoms, Boskovichian force points do engage
9141520	9144120	in action at a distance.
9144120	9149600	They don't interpenetrate, and in fact, Boskovich mathematically demonstrated how they could
9149600	9156200	both attract and repulse one another in accord with the same underlying mathematical principle.
9156200	9161000	It's very fascinating, even though the math is very much beyond me.
9161000	9166360	In Nietzsche's interpretation of Boskovich, the units that comprise what matter is are
9166360	9172120	less like solid atoms, individual bodies, but more like a field.
9172120	9176200	And these fields are sort of made up of the interaction of force points, each could be
9176200	9181640	called a quanta of power, or to speak the language of Nietzsche's later philosophy, a quanta
9181640	9183320	of will to power.
9183320	9189040	And so will to power will become, in Nietzsche's philosophical retelling of Boskovichian physics,
9189040	9195480	this qualitative description of what Boskovich's math showed, that the world is endless points
9195480	9200720	of force, all acting and exerting against one another, and manifesting the way that they
9200720	9205040	push against the other forces according to the distance that they act.
9205040	9210080	Or we might say the scale at which the force manifests.
9210080	9217680	And so Whitlock writes that in this way Nietzsche went beyond Spinoza, Kant, Lange, Uberweg,
9217680	9221400	Helmholtz, and all the Newtonian mechanists.
9221400	9227080	Whitlock writes, quote, Nietzsche sought to take the tradition another step further into
9227080	9233560	point particle theory, and to what he would soon call his, quote, force point world, end
9233560	9236160	quote.
9236160	9244720	So by doing this, Nietzsche is trying to get over what you might call sort of like the
9244720	9248120	epistemological baggage he's picked up from his biggest influence.
9248120	9252320	It's the transcendental idealism of Schopenhauer.
9252320	9258480	And that sort of, we might say is inherited from the teleology of Spinoza.
9258480	9263920	Nietzsche is trying to complete this vision of a strictly material world, which was first
9264040	9269680	abdumbrated by democratists, you know, he gave us the rough outline.
9269680	9275480	But Nietzsche knows that his biggest influence philosophically, Schopenhauer, can't help
9275480	9279320	him here because Schopenhauer is not a materialist.
9279320	9285640	And so Nietzsche has to therefore avoid the objections to materialism that figures such
9285640	9289120	as Schopenhauer had raised.
9289120	9292160	Schopenhauer used an argument that is very logical.
9292160	9297720	If one operates from the first principle set by Kant, which Schopenhauer accepts, the
9297720	9302160	starting premise of this argument is that we never directly experience a mind independent
9302160	9308120	reality and that everything we experience is just a representation.
9308120	9313640	Schopenhauer's argument is that then that means the atoms themselves are only a representation.
9313640	9317080	It's something I sort of referenced last week when we were talking, I referenced Donald
9317080	9318080	Hoffman last week.
9318080	9322880	I think I called him David Hoffman, which was just a genuine mistake, but I looked it up
9322880	9324960	and his name is actually Donald David Hoffman.
9324960	9330240	So congrats to me because I technically didn't misname him.
9330240	9336680	But Hoffman remarks upon his realization as a neurologist that looking at a neuron is
9336680	9338960	sort of like looking at a pixel.
9338960	9340200	It's the mind's representation.
9340200	9343520	It's a placeholder for something out there in reality.
9343520	9345360	It's not the reality itself.
9345440	9349240	So Schopenhauer essentially makes the same argument about the atom.
9349240	9355440	And even if you find the bedrock unit of matter, from which you hope to explain all material
9355440	9362040	things, all material processes, you're still just explaining it by way of representation.
9362040	9368960	And that the representation is something indirectly given as Schopenhauer puts it, right?
9368960	9370280	It's not the fundamental reality.
9370280	9372000	It's just a symbol of it.
9372000	9377320	And so attempting to explain reality by way of representation is compared to Munchausen
9377320	9381760	pulling himself up out of the marsh by pulling out on his own suspenders, right?
9381760	9385640	Or in some versions of the myth, it's by his hair.
9385640	9389880	It's where we get the phrase pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, right?
9389880	9393640	It's something that can't be done.
9393640	9399440	Longa carried on this idea of representation from Kant just as Schopenhauer had done.
9399440	9406640	But he became open to Schopenhauer's arguments against materialism because Longa wished to
9406640	9409960	account for representation through the physiology.
9409960	9418920	He's giving a physiological and thus a materialistic accounting of what representation is, right?
9418920	9425000	Because obviously if the physiology produces representations and the physiology is itself
9425000	9430080	known to us through representations we have of it, aren't we assuming what we're trying
9430080	9436040	to prove by appealing to physiology as the explanation, right, for representation?
9436040	9441760	And so your mind can kind of get tied in knots if you think about this too much.
9441760	9446040	Longa devotes a great deal of his history of materialism to reconcile these contradictions
9446040	9449000	and defend materialism as a solid grounding for science.
9449000	9454640	He took the time to really take Schopenhauer's philosophical arguments seriously and try
9454640	9456000	and rebut them.
9456000	9461840	And so Nietzsche was content to let Longa's arguments on that front do his work for him.
9461840	9467000	And maybe the simplest way to say this without getting too bogged down on this issue is that
9467000	9470320	I sort of paraphrase the argument from Nietzsche himself last week.
9470320	9474240	We can't take the representation as the most fundamental thing because it would mean that
9474240	9478440	our sense organs are themselves the representations of our organs.
9478440	9483600	And so it doesn't seem that we actually gain anything by appealing to the framework of
9483600	9489160	representation in order to object to materialism, right?
9489160	9492480	At best that would just be an argument that we can't make statements about the basis of
9492480	9495640	reality as it transcends the human mind.
9495640	9499640	But supposing we take it as a given that that's not what science is doing, that we're making
9499640	9504560	statements about the phenomenal world as we experience it, then there's really no problem.
9504560	9505760	And that's what science is doing.
9505760	9512240	So materialism, I think, Longa is correct, can serve as a basis for science.
9512240	9519320	And Schopenhauer's metaphysical objections to that are a bit sort of, I don't know, they're
9519320	9520920	a bit old and contrived.
9520920	9528040	And Nietzsche feels he can get over Schopenhauer's metaphysical objections and therefore fully
9528160	9533240	go all in on the materialist project and use Boskovich to complete it.
9533240	9538800	And Whitlock summarizes, quote, Nietzsche could rest assured that Schopenhauer's old
9538800	9544120	metaphysical arguments alone would not refute materialism, whereas Friedrich Albert Longa
9544120	9548960	stood between Kant and materialism, however Nietzsche went beyond both by rejecting their
9548960	9555160	shared presuppositions of extended Newtonian matter of the corpuscular atom.
9555160	9560040	To do so, he embraced the iconoclastic thought of someone rejected by both Kant and Longa,
9560040	9565600	namely Boskovich, and thus, at the end of his lecture on Democritus, Nietzsche soundly
9565600	9572120	dismisses Schopenhauer's argument and accepts Longa's materialism as a provisional hypothesis
9572120	9576600	until theoretical emendations can be made, end quote.
9576600	9583680	And so the way in which Nietzsche is influenced is interesting, but just as much so the way
9583680	9588320	Nietzsche goes against prior figures in the history of science is at least as informative
9588320	9592120	for our purposes.
9592120	9597040	Nietzsche believed that in Boskovich, therefore, he's overcome the problem of motion, which
9597040	9603240	obtained in the Newtonian and Kantian model, and had prompted Schopenhauer to say that
9603240	9609840	scientific explanations always reach for occult forces, explanations which are not themselves
9610000	9618480	explicable, and this problem dates back to Spinoza's own deus ex machina of using God
9618480	9621040	to shore up the hypothesis.
9621040	9627760	Spinoza, the language he uses, he drew upon the concept which originates in classical antiquity
9627760	9632720	and had been used by Descartes as well of Canatus.
9633040	9638600	Canatus is defined as a tendency within bodies for movement.
9638600	9644440	Obviously we can't stop there with our definition because that would be a just so argument.
9644440	9649760	It's an argument by definition, like the very thing Schopenhauer's criticizing as just
9649760	9654960	being an occult force or the way Nietzsche criticizes Kant for saying that we can have
9654960	9659400	synthetic a priori knowledge by virtue of a faculty.
9659400	9661640	You're just sort of defining it into existence.
9661640	9664800	So what is the explanation for Canatus?
9664800	9667280	What is it on a fundamental level?
9667280	9673640	And when we get right down to it, it's an expression of the power of God is how Spinoza
9673640	9675360	can explain it.
9675360	9681840	His conception of Canatus sees it as an inherent aspect within physical bodies, driving them
9681840	9685760	towards movement, and that it expresses the power of God.
9685760	9693240	And furthermore, he specifies that it constitutes a striving, particularly a striving to exist,
9693240	9699600	and that the striving constituted the actual essence of individual phenomena.
9699600	9703400	And so if this sounds like Schopenhauer's philosophy, we can see the definite parallels
9703400	9707480	and Schopenhauer's conception of the will to live.
9707480	9714200	Will in Schopenhauer's philosophy is, if not teleological, a sort of metaphysical explanation
9714320	9720640	for reality, which appeals to something not given by empirical experiment.
9720640	9726880	Schopenhauer, if not a teleologist, you know, he's a transcendental idealist, and he's
9726880	9730120	thus opposed to the project of materialism, as we've said.
9730120	9734600	And so the atheistic Schopenhauer is still perfectly willing to say that all things have
9734600	9742360	an essence, an inner character, which is universal and merely expresses itself in different manifestations,
9742360	9745640	which is defined by Schopenhauer as will.
9745640	9749560	Canatus is a clear influence on the idea of will.
9749560	9751120	It's also an inner essence.
9751120	9753880	It's a striving to exist.
9753880	9759240	And so Schopenhauer, just as Spinoza, is defiant towards any attempt to reduce his conception
9759240	9764400	to purely material explanations.
9764400	9769000	Nietzsche's leap from Democritus to Boskovich is the way Nietzsche sees it.
9769000	9771760	It's a resolution to the problem.
9771800	9774720	There's always been that gap into which God flows.
9774720	9777080	God flows into science, right?
9777080	9783960	And so while Nietzsche, maybe something instructive here is that Nietzsche considered the eliatics,
9783960	9789240	like Parmenides and Zeno, to be a dead end in the development of Greek scientific thought.
9789240	9796800	But they are instructive to us in that way, insofar as they deal with the problem of motion
9796800	9801360	by denying it altogether, right?
9801360	9803560	He says that motion is an illusion.
9803560	9811480	Zeno, in his famous paradox, shows how motion, when rendered into quantity, becomes absurd.
9811480	9816320	Its infinite divisibility makes nonsense of our own conception of movement in the passage
9816320	9817320	of time.
9817320	9825320	So motion is so problematic that some philosophers just deny that it's real, since it was unreasonable
9825320	9827000	for it to exist.
9827000	9831480	And so this is, you know, to Nietzsche, it's a dead end, because it doesn't really get
9831480	9836640	us any closer to reckoning with the reality of the phenomenal world as we experience it.
9836640	9841640	And so, in the history of science and the history of philosophy, we've marched on in
9841640	9846360	spite of the absurdity of motion, always, even if we have to account for it by making
9846360	9849240	reference to God.
9849240	9852920	Something not dissimilar to Parmenides is a conception of true being.
9853320	9859920	We have to make reference to this static, eternal, unchanging reality, God in the machine,
9859920	9866000	making the machine function, either as a first cause or as pantheism or whatever.
9866000	9870480	And so what's happened here is that our final explanations are not rational.
9870480	9873920	Our accounting of the physical world doesn't rise to the standards of what's permissible
9873920	9875400	as a rational explanation.
9875400	9882400	And so Whitlock writes that Nietzsche, quote, acquired what we might call his second order
9882400	9884400	theory of truth.
9884400	9888960	This second order principle requires that all first order theories be only representations
9888960	9895120	within a deeper underlying will, so that an adequate theory of matter must understand
9895120	9900720	matter as a representation of will and not as a thing in itself.
9900720	9905320	Note that this still allows work on a first order theory of nature, but only within the
9905320	9909360	confines of the second order theory of theories.
9909360	9914240	Nietzsche believed that a great leap, even a revolution as grand as that of Copernicus,
9914240	9920200	would be affected if a first order theory were to abandon Newtonian corpuscular atomism
9920200	9924880	and shift paradigms to a force point conception of the world.
9924880	9930240	Boscovician point particle theory overturned the Newtonian spinosist paradigm of extended
9930240	9936600	matter, bringing first order theory of nature into line with second order principles.
9936600	9941420	By reinterpreting Schopenhauer's notion of will, originally derived from Spinoza's
9941420	9948120	idea of Cognitus, in terms of an extended force point, all spinosistic metaphysics,
9948120	9952640	even substance, would be rendered useless.
9952640	9958920	Like Kant, Nietzsche would then be in a position to create the world from an unordered chaos,
9958920	9964240	a world as will to power.
9964240	9969360	So here we have it, Nietzsche's will to power is, in one sense, a response to centuries
9969360	9974760	of debates in the philosophy of science, an attempt to philosophize about the world in
9974760	9981240	such a way that is adequately reflective of the force point world of Boscovitch, which
9981240	9986840	to Nietzsche is the only way to understand the world materialistically in a consistent
9986840	9994400	manner, in which our theories and our principles completely align and shift things away from
9994400	10001880	the stubborn teleology of Spinoza, the deus ex machina of Kant and Newton into a pure materialism
10001880	10008360	described by a single force that merely manifests itself in various phenomenal forms.
10008360	10013520	In other words, Nietzsche is talking about a fundamental will, and this is what Boscovitch's
10013640	10020160	single mathematical principle represents to Nietzsche, that fundamental will in a quantitative
10020160	10022360	form.
10022360	10025680	Here's another quotation from Whitlock, quote,
10025680	10031080	The anti-teleological motives on Nietzsche's part suggest not that he was a nihilist seeking
10031080	10036680	to enlist science in his campaign against religion, but rather that he was already searching
10036680	10043120	for his own scientific hypothesis, one that would prove anathema to the real nihilists,
10043120	10047600	those Europeans who all still clung to a belief in God.
10047600	10053720	He found the scientific vision to be exhilarating and associated it with the tragic Heraklitean-Dianisian
10053720	10057800	perspective he had discovered philologically.
10057800	10067060	It proved to him a source of pessimism out of strength, not nihilism, end quote.
10067060	10072480	So as we talked about last time, these lecture notes on the pre-platonics speak to a deep
10072520	10080000	scientific interest, and throughout the pre-platonic lectures, we have Nietzsche's various references
10080000	10085680	to the Kant-Laplace hypothesis, you know, that's the hypothesis, the universe came from
10085680	10090120	a disordered gaseous state and was formed by physical laws into the various forms that
10090120	10092240	exist today.
10092240	10096360	We have references to von Beyer's pulse rate experiments, or thought experiment, I don't
10096360	10100760	want to see it, his discussion of Paracelsus and Lavassier.
10100760	10107600	These digressions in the lectures are numbered at seven and named by Aniandres and Karl Schlechter
10107600	10114800	as quote, seven excursions into the natural sciences end quote.
10114800	10119600	Aniandres then wrote the following synopsis of the implications of Nietzsche's interest
10119600	10126320	in the natural sciences and the references that Nietzsche brings up and how he uses them.
10126320	10132640	He writes, quote, if we now summarize from the seven excursions what characterizes the
10132640	10137360	natural sciences for Nietzsche, it would be the following three fundamental matters of
10137360	10146680	concern, one, to comprehend nature as one continuous becoming, two, to explain order
10146680	10156560	in it, nature, by means of purposeless, simple forces, and three, to conceive qualities
10156560	10158680	as quantities.
10158680	10163640	In contrast, the question of the essence of matter, as it might be posed for example in
10163640	10167480	relation to Democritus's theory, plays no role for Nietzsche.
10167480	10171400	He finds himself in complete agreement with natural science.
10171400	10175680	It too brackets the question of the essence of matter.
10175680	10183840	Nietzsche will later demonstrate this impressively with regard to the Boscovician system end quote.
10183840	10192480	So in the pre-plutonic figures Nietzsche discovers for himself clarity about the activity of the
10192480	10200280	sciences, Thales, Annex Cyminder, and so on, contemplated nature as one continuous becoming,
10200280	10205480	insofar as they attempted to find the fundamental nature of matter from which all other forms
10205480	10208080	can be derived.
10208080	10212760	The attempts to explain nature by means of purposeless and simple forces occur throughout
10212760	10217600	the work of Annex Agoras or Democritus.
10217600	10228280	And the last trait of conceiving qualities as quantities, we see that in full force in
10228280	10231360	the later Pythagoreans.
10231360	10235080	They are distinguished by Nietzsche from Pythagoras himself.
10235080	10241680	Pythagoras himself is supposed to be more of a mythical cult-like figure.
10241680	10246960	The Pythagoreans, on the other hand, gave mathematical explanations of everything, of
10246960	10251960	music, of space, of all sorts of qualities and relationships.
10251960	10256280	And this is sort of what it means to translate qualities into quantities.
10256360	10264000	So it's like, if Democritus is atomism, Democritus plus the later Pythagoreans sort of together
10264000	10272040	birth this mathematical atomism, which is the way we think about science today, yet again,
10272040	10273040	right?
10273040	10278040	And so the ultimate scientific achievement in Nietzsche's eyes is the creation of a single
10278040	10285640	law to describe all patterns and relationships, makes nature into one single continuous becoming,
10285640	10292960	and then what is the third thing Annie Ender says, translates this into mathematical form.
10292960	10297200	Newton believed that the laws governing physical bodies could not be reduced to less than three
10297200	10298440	laws.
10298440	10302960	Baskovic, meanwhile, has a single law, right?
10302960	10311000	And so, and with this one mathematical statement, Baskovic connects gravity, chemistry, electricity,
10311000	10315760	cohesion, attraction, and repulsion.
10315760	10320080	And so with the Baskovician system, Nietzsche can rebuild the world from the ground up with
10320080	10323480	will to power as the basis.
10323480	10332480	It's because of this sort of the mathematicizing of the world of the later Pythagoreans, Baskovic
10332480	10334400	is called the modern Pythagoras.
10334400	10340160	This is in the words of Baskovic's biographer Lancelot Law White.
10340160	10346920	He says that Baskovic is, quote, Pythagoras extended to cover process, end quote.
10346920	10350800	And so, you know, White's assessment of Pythagoras is sort of at variance with what Nietzsche
10350800	10352960	had to say about Pythagoras.
10352960	10359480	So we can just take it that by calling Baskovic a Pythagoras extended to cover process.
10359480	10365680	He's referring more to Pythagorean philosophy as expressed by the later Pythagoreans.
10365680	10370360	Baskovic can be associated with the later Pythagoreans because, you know, these figures
10370360	10375840	come after a democratist and similarly, you know, for Nietzsche's purposes, he's charting
10375840	10381120	a course of how materialism develops emerging in post-enlightenment Europe just as it did
10381120	10383000	in ancient Greece.
10383000	10391040	And so Baskovic is the figure to stand sort of in correspondence to the later Pythagoreans
10391040	10400240	and thus completing the materialism that we see in the Greek arena emerging with democratists.
10400240	10405160	And with Baskovic, we can finally give the material explanation for things like consciousness,
10405160	10407280	mind, values, and so on.
10407280	10414000	Or if not Baskovic himself, Nietzsche can take the Baskovician basis and weave that into
10414000	10415000	his philosophy.
10415960	10422840	I'm going to look at one final quote from Whitlock's commentary here because, I mean,
10422840	10426720	he does such a good job throughout this, but here he describes the similarity between the
10426720	10431400	ancient Pythagorean worldview and Baskovic.
10431400	10436520	And he gives us an overall picture of how Baskovician point particle theory sits in
10436520	10440920	relation to Newton and Leibniz.
10441920	10448360	Chemistry, atomism, Pythagoreanism, overlapped with Nietzsche's intensive and extensive
10448360	10450440	interest in Baskovic.
10450440	10455200	A far greater importance, however, is the Pythagorean construction of the world from
10455200	10457160	points.
10457160	10463080	Points in motion constitute lines, intersecting lines create surfaces, surfaces connect to
10463080	10467360	make the Pythagorean five regular solids.
10467360	10472960	It is precisely in this regard that Baskovic is known as Pythagoras extended to cover process.
10472960	10479200	For such solids made of points, though not of five types, in physical processes are what
10479200	10482760	Baskovic's theory attempted to describe.
10482760	10488400	Baskovic also began with an image of the world as a vast mass of points in motion, interacting
10488400	10492240	dynamically and kinematically in pairs.
10492240	10497120	He constructed solid objects from these points and even described physical processes by
10497120	10501480	reference to a point particle world.
10501480	10507120	Unlike the Pythagoreans, Baskovic saw his points as subject to inertia, retraction,
10507120	10512440	sorry, attraction, and repulsion as a function of their distance from each other rather than
10512440	10514840	of sheer number.
10514840	10521000	Baskovic was eclipsed as the greatest European mind of his time only by two contemporaries,
10521000	10525360	Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.
10525360	10531880	The inventors of calculus, Newton and Leibniz embraced corpuscular atomism and monodology,
10531880	10533160	respectively.
10533160	10539480	Baskovic purposely devised a point particle theory between Newton and Leibniz, but his
10539480	10546400	system would suffer highs and lows of respectability, until the advent of Michael Faraday, James
10546400	10552480	Clark Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and other late 19th century scientists who acknowledged his
10552480	10554480	genius.
10554600	10559920	Leibniz's monodology was closely related to Nietzsche's own experimental time atomism,
10559920	10565640	but Nietzsche rejected Leibniz's windowless monads for the Baskovician principle of action
10565640	10567800	at a distance.
10567800	10571720	Baskovic's centers of force were to have inertia and forces dependent on the distance
10571720	10573720	between two points.
10573720	10579600	Nevertheless, even Baskovic's dynamic properties and non corpuscular atomism, his action at
10579600	10585000	a distance in field theory, did not posit an inner driving force.
10585000	10587360	Baskovician force is external.
10587360	10592040	By conceiving of the will to power as the inner dynamic, Nietzsche would go beyond Baskovic
10592040	10598120	and Leibniz, though he would only rarely refer to Baskovic by name in his major published
10598120	10603120	works.
10603120	10608840	After his study of the pre-plotonics, interpreted through the light of the modern philosophers
10608840	10616360	of science, in which Nietzsche finds the culmination of this project in Democritus and the later
10616360	10621840	Pythagoreans, and then in his own day in Baskovic, the only remaining element Nietzsche needs
10621840	10627360	is the will to power, in order to provide qualitative expression of the world.
10627360	10635360	And of course, this expression includes the mind itself, Nietzsche, and the willing subject,
10635360	10643440	the conscious subject, all of us are the will to power expressing itself.
10643440	10648480	Nietzsche can explain philosophy through his new theory because he, like all philosophers,
10648480	10653800	is an avatar of the faculty of reason attempting to bound the world, which is yet another form
10653800	10664000	of these quantas of power attempting to push against and overcome other things, or overcome
10664000	10667960	resistance and challenges.
10667960	10672240	Nietzsche thus encounters kindred spirits in his study, which is another thing he gains
10672240	10676000	from this, it's not just his philosophy of science, so for example, his favorite is of
10676000	10681880	course Heraclitus, but this should not overshadow the other admirable forerunners of Nietzsche's
10681880	10687240	task and philosophy, especially figures like Democritus.
10687240	10693440	But Nietzsche goes beyond all his influences, he goes beyond Longa by involving Baskovic
10693440	10699200	in his system at all, and he even goes beyond Baskovic by sort of drawing on the Schopenhauerian
10699200	10704040	idea of an inner content or essence.
10704040	10709520	Nietzsche finishes his lecture on the later Pythagoreans with another cryptic remark that,
10709520	10716280	quote, if only the Pythagoreans really knew what calculates the world, end quote.
10716280	10721520	The implication is perhaps the will to power, but Nietzsche didn't really have that exact
10721520	10724560	formulation at this point in his thought.
10724560	10729200	Maybe he had the notion of it, but not the words, so we don't really know, maybe we'll
10729200	10733200	simply be left to wonder about that.
10733200	10739160	Now, okay, let's take a look at some of the more extreme and therefore more interesting
10739160	10743680	statements that Nietzsche makes about will to power, where he seems to speak of it not
10743680	10750280	merely as a psychological explanation, but as the single force that explains the world.
10750280	10754200	We can even see this kind of talk about will to power in at least one place in Nietzsche's
10754200	10756600	public or published work.
10756600	10761040	It's a passage that's particularly instructive because even though Nietzsche puts material
10761040	10765520	in quotation marks in this passage and seems to raise questions about some of the things
10765520	10771080	he might have taken for granted during his philological period, his pre-philosophical
10771080	10777080	period, this passage makes a lot more sense in light of this physical aspect of the will
10777080	10782200	to power, and it makes a lot less sense if you're thinking of will to power in a purely
10782200	10784320	psychological sense.
10784320	10790880	So we're going to look at Beyond Good and Evil, aphorism 36, which I've slightly abridged.
10790880	10791880	Quote,
10821400	10824960	mechanistic or material world?
10824960	10829880	In the end, not only is it permitted to make this experiment, the conscience of method
10829880	10832200	demands it.
10832200	10837440	Not to assume several kinds of causality, until the experiment of making do with a single
10837440	10844240	one has been pushed to its utmost limit, to the point of nonsense if I may say so.
10844240	10848120	That is a moral of method which one may not shirk today.
10848120	10852520	It follows from its definition, as a mathematician would say.
10852520	10857880	The question is, in the end, whether we really recognize the will as efficient, whether we
10857880	10860560	believe in the causality of the will.
10860560	10865680	If we do, and at bottom, our faith in this is nothing less than our faith in causality
10865680	10871800	itself, then we have to make the experiment of positing the causality of the will hypothetically
10871800	10873960	as the only one.
10873960	10879400	Will of course can only affect will and not matter, not nerves, for example.
10879400	10885040	In short, one has to risk the hypothesis whether will does not affect will wherever
10885040	10891360	effects are recognized, and whether all mechanical occurrences are not, insofar as a force is
10891360	10896960	active in them, will force effects of will.
10896960	10902960	Suppose finally we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development
10902960	10911160	and ramification of one basic form of the will, namely of the will to power as my proposition
10911160	10913000	has it.
10913000	10917300	Suppose all organic functions can be traced back to this will to power, and one could
10917300	10922080	also find in it the solution of the problem of procreation and nourishment.
10922080	10927360	It is one problem, and then one would have gained the right to determine all efficient
10927360	10931760	force univocally as will to power.
10931760	10937120	The world viewed from inside, the world defined and determined according to its intelligible
10937120	10945640	character, would be will to power and nothing else.
10945640	10950680	And so I think the very peculiar thing about Hanitius thought developed after this initial
10950680	10958440	immersion in materialism and anti-teleology, it's the idea that he retains from that period
10958440	10963800	is the quest to render an expression of the world in as few principles as possible, and
10963800	10971920	to do it without appeal to these God and the machine explanations.
10971920	10981240	And so here he says, let's take one form of causality that we know is real, or rather
10981240	10985880	because in the context of the first book of Beyond Good Nievil, he's been very clear
10985880	10989840	in his statements on truth and sort of pointing out we don't actually know that it's real,
10989840	10993880	but this is the thing that we have perhaps the most faith in, which is that the will
10993880	10996360	is a causal force, right?
10996360	11001200	And let's take that one principle and push it through to its ultimate conclusions, even
11001200	11003840	to the point of absurdity.
11003840	11007640	And so what does that mean where he's saying our belief in the will is synonymous with
11007640	11009640	our belief in causality?
11009640	11016800	I mean, he's saying that in our own experience, we experience volition as a causal force.
11016800	11023160	Whether it's free or not free, this is true for Nietzsche, either way, it's his way of
11023160	11028200	talking about what people might call the experience of making choices, whether the choice is freely
11028200	11030680	made or not.
11030680	11035720	For Nietzsche, it's the will itself rather than rational, deliberative intellect that
11035720	11037880	causes our actions.
11037880	11042480	And so if it's permitted to talk of causes at all, then the cause is will.
11042480	11044480	This is the only immediate reality that we know.
11044480	11048080	Why not begin from this position that will is the only given?
11048080	11050640	Because the only given is our experience.
11050640	11058320	So it would mean therefore that will cannot affect quote unquote matter, but only other
11058320	11061400	expressions or centers of will.
11061400	11064920	Since we've already said that will is the only reality.
11064920	11068760	Why not begin from the position of viewing the world from inside, from its intelligible
11068760	11074660	character, the only thing that is given or intelligible to us?
11074660	11081280	And so the fundamental character of matter, that matter would simply be the mind symbol
11081280	11086600	for representing it, but the fundamental character of matter as a sort of experiment, as the
11086600	11093760	way Nietzsche phrases it, conceive of matter as basically being will, will being the essence
11093760	11095120	of matter.
11095120	11099760	So that might be one sense I kind of disagree with Whitlock, or maybe he's correct about
11099760	11103560	Nietzsche during the period of the, when he's lecturing as a philologist.
11103560	11108800	But I think later he does sort of come down in the ideas that once he starts thinking
11108800	11112800	about will to power as an inner force or an inner intelligible character, he is not bracketing
11112800	11117960	the question of matter, essence of matter any longer, he is asking what it is.
11117960	11121400	But it's still just an experiment, right?
11121400	11127360	But Nietzsche says that his proposition of describing the most fundamental and single
11127360	11132480	unifying principle as will to power is the only single philosophical principle one can
11132480	11137600	use, which describes all efficient force in the world, which is very interesting.
11137600	11142200	Like that, you know, it's more explanatory than Schopenhauer's will to live or Spinoza's
11142200	11143200	canatus.
11143200	11146040	That's what he's saying here.
11146040	11151800	And so that if you're just thinking about will to power as a moral or psychological
11151800	11158000	principle, the full force of that power doesn't really come through, or of that passage doesn't
11158000	11163240	really come through that he's saying will to power is the true character of the world
11163240	11169600	first and foremost, and that that's the most explanatory lens we have at the moment in
11169600	11174320	order to talk about it.
11174320	11176640	This issue, I think, is clarified in his notes.
11176640	11185000	This is in will to power number 619, quote, the victorious concept force by means of
11185000	11190600	which our physicists have created God in the world still needs to be completed, an inner
11190600	11196080	will must be ascribed to it, which I designate as will to power, i.e. an insatiable desire
11196080	11201880	to manifest power, whereas the employment and exercise of power as a creative drive,
11202000	11208920	etc. Physicists cannot eradicate action at a distance from their principles, nor can
11208920	11213200	they eradicate a repellent force or an attracting one.
11213200	11214760	There is nothing for it.
11214760	11220600	One is obliged to understand all motion, all appearances, all laws, only a symptoms of
11220600	11225720	an inner event, and to employ man as an analogy to this end.
11225720	11230760	In the case of an animal, it is possible to trace all its drives to the will to power.
11230840	11239000	Likewise, all the functions of organic life to this one source, end quote.
11239000	11243760	So while those rigorous scientific minds of today who may be listening may have borne
11243760	11247480	with me for quite a while in this discussion, we're getting to the point that Nietzsche's
11247480	11255000	views maybe are having less value towards answering questions and philosophy of science.
11255000	11260120	But maybe the best takeaway is that we're gaining an insight into the way Nietzsche
11260200	11267560	thinks and that he has a valid criticism in the fact that we're content to say that things are,
11267560	11268360	what is it?
11268360	11273560	Well, it's a force without giving some definitive content by which we can describe what it means
11273560	11275160	to invoke a force.
11275160	11280200	And his idea of what it means to invoke a force is that this concept is yet another
11280840	11282520	manifestation of will to power.
11283160	11287880	And we can see his defense of Boskovich on this passage, even though Boskovich goes unnamed,
11288120	11292040	he defends action at a distance, which is central to Boskovich's theory.
11293000	11299400	And that his single mathematical expression explains the behavior of nature as it manifests
11299400	11302200	differently depending on the scale of distance involved.
11302200	11308520	And Nietzsche references a repellent and attractive forces keyed to the description
11308520	11311240	of Boskovich's force point particles.
11311880	11317000	He references it in relation to will to power, which means that he is thinking about will to power
11317080	11318680	in a physical sense, right?
11318680	11319480	Sense of physics.
11321000	11325080	Now, some of his later notes as we go further into his career,
11326200	11331080	as we've talked about, he ends up taking a somewhat dim view of mechanism
11332040	11339240	and thought that materialism taken too far itself sort of becomes a bit metaphysical.
11339240	11341560	And I think that's because of the problem of causality,
11342280	11347160	which I think Nietzsche genuinely doesn't believe that we can derive causality from anything,
11347160	11347480	right?
11347480	11352440	That we're left regarding causality as either a sort of like artifact of our representation
11352440	11355560	of the world, which means it's not independent of the human mind,
11356440	11360920	or else we have to call it a sort of metaphysical force like Canatus, right?
11360920	11365240	So mechanistic explanations don't ultimately do it for Nietzsche.
11365240	11370360	And because of his insistence that the most real thing is the intelligible character,
11370360	11373960	that's the only thing that's actually a given, that matters should basically,
11374840	11377480	we should start from the position that matter is will to power.
11380200	11389080	Then it's less important for him to present a mechanistic world in the sense that everything
11389080	11394360	is governed by cause and effect, as it is to present the idea that the various phenomenal
11394360	11403880	forms are simply can all be bounded within the explanation of Baskovician unified field theory,
11403880	11404120	right?
11407080	11411400	In the note numbered 624, Nietzsche argues against the physical atom.
11412520	11417240	And so here he takes the inverse position that transforming qualities into quantities is in
11417240	11422440	any way a useful thing when Nietzsche writes, quote, the calculability of the world,
11422440	11426760	the expressibility of all events and formulas, is this really comprehension?
11427720	11432680	How much of a piece of music has been understood when that in it which is calculable and can be
11432680	11435640	reduced to formulas has been reckoned up, end quote.
11437400	11442360	And he even acknowledges in the note number 627 that attraction and repulsion,
11442360	11446440	which are central aspects of Baskovician physics, are fictions.
11447000	11451960	And he says that this attempt to think about the world in a purely mechanistic sense is a desire
11451960	11453320	to see causality everywhere.
11453320	11459960	And he goes so far as to say in that note that quote, the belief in cause falls with the belief
11459960	11466280	in tele, parentheses, against Spinoza and his causalism, end quote.
11468280	11471640	And so with everything we've talked about, that should be rather clear, right?
11471640	11476040	It's a he's actually giving a rather radical view that seriously depends on the fact that
11476280	11481000	departs from his earlier views as we've covered them in this talk, that to say that any belief
11481000	11486440	in cause and effect constitutes a teleology, which Nietzsche will therefore oppose.
11487400	11494680	And so Nietzsche's complex views on causality, I mean, I've said it, I think elsewhere,
11494680	11499080	or I think I might have brought it up in a Q&A, which is not going to be out yet to the public,
11499080	11502120	but I might have to do an episode just strictly on causality.
11502120	11504360	It's probably not going to be for a little while.
11504360	11506440	But it really complicates the issue.
11506440	11510680	It complicates the understanding of later Nietzsche's views of science rather considerably.
11511640	11518360	But we also find in the notes collected in Will to Power, a clear continuation of Nietzsche's quest
11518360	11523960	to reshape the world into something which is fundamentally only Will to Power.
11523960	11528200	And to understand Will to Power is something all pervasive, something constitutive of,
11528200	11534360	constitutive, I have so much trouble with that word, of all phenomena.
11535320	11540840	And so Will to Power is something which is descriptive of all becoming,
11541880	11546120	an attempt to bound the boundless just as the prepletonics like Democritus were doing.
11546920	11551000	And I think in his unpublished notes that we have in the Will to Power collection,
11551720	11554440	Nietzsche is in his more ambitious moments.
11554680	11559640	He thinks he has this element of Will to Power which would allow him to take Democritus,
11559640	11566680	take Boskovich, and move on to this fundamental unifying theory that accounts for purposefulness
11566680	11569400	and movement and procreation and nourishment.
11571160	11573960	I'm going to be perfectly honest with all of you when I say that at the end of this,
11573960	11577000	I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around everything Nietzsche is getting at
11577000	11578280	in his philosophy of science.
11579000	11583080	And insofar as Will to Power can be understood as a natural or physical principle.
11583880	11587560	And this is part of the reason why I think Nietzsche did not publish some of his more
11587560	11589560	radical statements about Will to Power.
11589560	11592840	It's why he only mentions Boskovich very rarely in his published work.
11593400	11597480	I think there's a concern that his statements might be misunderstood or misrepresented,
11597480	11601000	or taken in a teleological or religious sense.
11602360	11607240	Perhaps Nietzsche's skepticism of causality or his awareness of the contingency of all human
11607240	11612760	perspective or similar such concerns led him to regard such a grand unifying
11613720	11616600	philosophical theory as being impure thinking.
11617720	11624040	This might be why Nietzsche abandoned the idea of Will to Power as a planned magnum opus.
11624040	11628760	Maybe he considered it was just better not to go there and let these ideas remain in the
11628760	11630680	background of his published works.
11630680	11633640	Something which informs his ideas and informs the way he thinks,
11633640	11637000	but it's best not to bring it into the foreground because of the misunderstandings
11637000	11637800	that there could be.
11639560	11644600	On the other hand, with this more scientifically rich understanding of what the Will to Power
11644600	11651480	can be, I think we should now consider one of the most infamous passages of Nietzsche's work.
11652440	11656760	And it's actually the very last passage contained in the collection of unpublished notes
11657400	11658360	in Will to Power.
11659880	11663400	It's rightfully infamous because if you haven't engaged with the full breadth of Nietzsche's
11663480	11669640	ideas, such a passage can be really dangerous, I think, but it's one of the finest examples
11669640	11672360	of gorgeous overflowing Nietzschean prose.
11672360	11678920	And I think it attains a powerful subtlety of meaning in light of these considerations
11679560	11681960	of Nietzsche's scientific influences.
11681960	11688600	And so the last note in Will to Power aphorism 1067, quote,
11689400	11693480	And do you know what the world is to me?
11694680	11696360	Shall I show it to you in my mirror?
11697640	11702680	This world, a monster of energy without beginning, without end.
11703720	11707640	A firm iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller,
11708360	11714920	that does not expend itself but only transforms itself as a whole of unalterable size,
11715800	11721160	a household without expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income,
11722280	11728520	enclosed by nothingness as by a boundary, not something blurry or wasted,
11728520	11734440	not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force,
11735000	11740680	and not a space that might be empty here or there, but rather as a force throughout,
11741560	11746120	as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many,
11746840	11752360	increasing here and at the same time decreasing there, a sea of forces flowing and rushing
11752360	11758600	together, eternally changing, eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence,
11758600	11764520	with an ebb and a flood of its forms, out of the simplest forms striving towards the most
11764520	11770680	complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms striving towards the hottest,
11771240	11776840	most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple,
11776840	11781720	out of this abundance, out of the play of contradictions, back to the joy of concord,
11782440	11786920	still affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years,
11786920	11790440	blessing itself as that which must return eternally,
11790680	11796680	as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness,
11797640	11804360	this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating, the eternally self-destroying,
11804360	11811560	this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my beyond good and evil, without goal,
11812200	11818760	unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal, without will, unless a ring feels good will
11818760	11824840	towards itself," end quote. And so what do we find in this description of the world?
11825960	11832520	It is a totality of unalterable size, not something blurry and undefined,
11832520	11837720	and not endlessly extended. To Nietzsche the world is something definite,
11837720	11844520	with definite boundaries and definite size. So it's not the indefinite of Anaximander, right?
11845320	11849880	And it's ruled by transformations, dynamism of forms arising and passing away.
11850600	11855240	Even though the total size, the totality of matter itself does not alter. So the fundamental,
11856680	11862120	you know, we could say the fundamental material of the world changes in shape and arrangement,
11862120	11867160	but nothing is created or destroyed. It's a household without expenses or losses,
11867240	11874760	without increase or income. So the similarities there to Democritus and to Anaxagoras,
11874760	11879720	and even to Heraclitus are very clear. And what else does Nietzsche say about this world of his?
11880440	11886440	Quote, a play of forces and waves of forces at the same time one in many, increasing here and at
11886440	11892200	the same time decreasing there, a sea of forces flowing and rushing together eternally changing,
11892200	11898360	end quote. This is the multiplicity of phenomena within the world of becoming.
11898360	11901000	And these separate phenomena are really centers of force,
11902040	11906200	force points, if you will, flowing and rushing and pushing against one another.
11906200	11913240	This one force pervades everywhere. So Boskovich, right? And everywhere, what do we find? Recurrence.
11914120	11917720	The simple strives towards the complex, the hot towards the cold.
11918680	11923720	So we even see preplotonic forces that were incorporated into the Nietzschean world,
11923720	11926120	right? Warmth and cold and attraction and repulsion,
11927480	11933400	you know, the voice of Anaximida and Empedocles. And we might consider also how Nietzsche understands
11933400	11940200	will to power as manifesting in life forms, which start as young and vigorous and grow into maturity,
11940200	11945080	and then their energy leaves them and they decline eventually. And so he sees strength
11945720	11952040	as expanding until it eventually declines, something which bursts forth and then passes away.
11952040	11958760	He sees weakness or dissolution as ever recursive, always arising again to break down the various
11959400	11965560	manifestations of will. And taking influence from Heraclitus, he sees this world as essentially
11965560	11972600	innocent. It's beyond good and evil. It knows no disgust, no satiety. So he would reject the
11972600	11978680	Empedoclean view of a metaphysical reality to love or hatred or the Schopenhauerian view of life,
11979480	11983720	reducing to satiety and boredom, you know, this eternal suffering of desire and want.
11984520	11988680	To Nietzsche, this world is eternally creating and eternally destroying,
11988680	11995160	but it's ever innocent and self affirming. It's the innocence of becoming, the play of Aeon,
11995160	11999400	the boy god of the zodiac, building sand castles on the beach and knocking them down.
12000360	12006360	The world, just like the play of a child, has no goal, unless the circle itself is the goal,
12006360	12012600	right? So in other words, no telos. We can only observe the pattern which the world produces
12012600	12019560	blindly, which is endless recursion, the eternal spin of these forces manifesting creation,
12020360	12026280	and then bringing on destruction in an endless repeating dance. So Nietzsche then tells us,
