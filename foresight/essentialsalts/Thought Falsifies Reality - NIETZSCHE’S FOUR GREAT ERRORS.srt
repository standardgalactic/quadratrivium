1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,120
If I were to suggest a use for philosophy, I would argue that perhaps its best use is as a tool

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:16,640
for uprooting weeds. Let's assume for a moment that the psyche, the mind, is something like a patch

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,000
of earth, and that within our minds we have all sorts of plants that are growing in there,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,640
and you know where the germs for these plants come from it may not always be obvious,

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,560
much that's within the mind, remains deep beneath the soil, beneath the surface of our

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,760
consciousness. All of us would like to imagine that, at the very least, we are competent gardeners

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,200
of our own mental soil, and that only those beliefs and opinions and sentiments which we

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:53,920
planted there, and that we nourish, only those are allowed to grow there. But the reality is,

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,120
perhaps, unfortunately, that the ecosystem of the mind is not so consciously planned

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,560
as we'd like to imagine it. All sorts of invasive species make their way into the psyche,

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,680
and our minds are cross-pollinated, so to speak, with all the other garden plots around us,

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,200
all those other individuals, and their beliefs and their opinions. Things were planted in us

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,800
before we were born, or before we were old enough to have any understanding of what was being planted.

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,600
In short, most of us walk around with the ideas of other people in our heads,

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
and while this certainly doesn't mean that everything we receive from our culture

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,320
and from our upbringing is negative, it does mean that it is a somewhat natural inclination

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,400
for human beings to passively or even unconsciously accept any number of what we might call

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,800
common-sense notions. Here in modernity, we are more or less comfortable with admitting

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:09,040
that this sort of passive receipt of ideas occurs when it comes to, for example, moral judgments.

20
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,200
It's easy enough to see how a social animal, such as a human being, would naturally mimic

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,360
the moral beliefs of other human beings around them, to whatever degree, and whatever you think

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,560
about morality, I would say most people are on board with that idea, but this doesn't stop with

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,240
morality. Suppose there are prejudices with even deeper roots. Suppose these prejudices are not

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,440
simply moral, or that they don't only concern themselves with human behavior and the social

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,640
mores. Suppose that we have prejudices that constitute a kind of received wisdom as concerns

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,600
the most basic facts of reality, that when it comes to not just how to act, but the nature

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,280
of reality itself, we are operating based on a series of beliefs that we've simply passively

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,520
accepted. Philosophy finds its use here. It's an activity in disabusing ourselves from believing

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,240
in truths that we've received as common sense wisdom with no other justification beyond

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,400
that simple fact. Philosophy, in some sense, begins when we start to take note of the ways

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,000
in which even the most mundane assertions and statements of opinion contain within them

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,800
metaphysical beliefs, and that these metaphysical beliefs have simply been allowed to grow within

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,560
your garden without you even taking note of it. Now, suppose that among such received beliefs

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,760
that you possess are included beliefs that are in fact errors. Mistakes, perhaps owing to an

35
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,120
inherent flaw in human psychology, or whatever the case may be, and that nevertheless such a

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,760
mistake has simply been allowed to propagate or even been called self-evident. This is what we

37
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,640
would call a weed. We could in fact characterize the various great philosophers according to which

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,200
weeds they set themselves the task of uprooting. So with Socrates, the unquestioned way of life

39
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:24,240
of the Athenians set by religion and tradition, Descartes, the prejudice that the external world

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,120
in our perception of it can simply be taken for granted. Rousseau, the faith that civilization

41
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,480
has improved mankind. Hegel, that things are things in themselves, separable from the things to

42
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,720
which they are related, and so on and so forth. We've defined all these philosophers by what

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,160
they're attacking, right? In some sense, philosophy always begins within attack on a view that the

44
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,080
philosopher has realized to be nothing more than an assumption, an unquestionable assumption,

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,880
because it's assumed by so many. As we all know by now, Friedrich Nietzsche was a prodigious critic,

46
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,000
and if we were to say that philosophy begins at this point of attack, you'd also have to say

47
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,480
few philosophized as hard as Nietzsche did. He never declared peace. His critique of modern

48
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,160
thought begins in his first book, and it continues through to the very end. His targets are numerous,

49
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,760
among the assumptions that he attempted to weed out are, well, morality itself,

50
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,640
or the notion of a true world, an intelligible world behind the senses,

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,800
an intuition that begins in philosophy but becomes passively accepted through religion.

52
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Nietzsche also attempts to uproot nihilism or world weariness, sentiments that Nietzsche believed

53
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,120
were suffused throughout modern culture. Already, these are sort of titanic, monstrous weeds that

54
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,760
Nietzsche has decided to wrestle with. Today, we're going to take a look at one of those critical

55
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,200
passages in Nietzsche, which is in Twilight of Idols. Many of the sections contained in Twilight

56
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,160
of Idols are Nietzsche's attempts to summarize or condense ideas that he'd written about for

57
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,240
over a decade by this point. This section is no different. It is called The Four Great Errors.

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,720
I've discussed this section a long time ago on the podcast in the episode on free will,

59
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,480
and I think it's been brought up in one or two other episodes over the years.

60
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,600
But this passage is important enough on its own to warrant its own discussion.

61
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,240
It was relevant to our discussion on free will because the Four Great Errors

62
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,120
is the most significant passage for comprehending Nietzsche's view on that subject,

63
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,680
above pretty much all other passages in Nietzsche's corpus. And in The Four Great Errors, he attacks

64
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,480
free will, but without falling into the determinist camp. The reason he doesn't fall into that

65
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,920
camp is because the criticism in The Four Great Errors is targeted at our whole mental framework

66
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,360
of cause and effect, or rather the way in which cause and effect are applied in our thought.

67
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,480
Nietzsche can't be a determinist because he's not even convinced that our will is bound within

68
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,280
an infinite net of causes. That would be the normal determinist critique of the libertarian

69
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,000
free will doctrine, but it would still fundamentally be the same error. And while Nietzsche doesn't

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,880
quite come up to the point of denying causality altogether, he calls into question all of the

71
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,760
commonplace habits in our thinking about causality, that color the way that we make

72
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,840
sense of reality, that what we designate as a cause and what we designate as effect

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,560
is often an arbitrary distinction. Usually the reason for distinguishing the cause from the effect

74
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,760
accords with some kind of psychological need or inclination, rather than what might be a sober

75
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,640
understanding of reality. Furthermore, we often reason backward to determine the so-called cause

76
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,720
of a given event. The mind will invent causes where one is not immediately perceptible.

77
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,960
Free will is merely one of the erroneous thought processes that Nietzsche draws our

78
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,680
attention to in this passage. But in fact, this type of error goes all the way down to our very

79
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:38,240
conception of being, of a reality full of quote unquote things that are consistent, unitary,

80
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,040
coherent. In other words, existence or beings. Again, one of those apparently self-evident

81
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,480
truths contained within that word being, that nevertheless has metaphysical implications

82
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,880
about reality itself, and that we nevertheless all use on a daily basis because it's baked into

83
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,200
the structure of our language. So first, I'll list off these four errors, and then we'll get

84
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,080
into the nuts and bolts of the passage in which Nietzsche explains what he means by each and gives

85
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:17,680
examples. The errors are as follows. One, the error of confusing cause and effect. This is quite

86
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:25,840
straightforward. We believe something is a cause when actually it's an effect. Two, the error of

87
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:33,040
false causality. That is, we believe something is in a causal relationship when in fact it only

88
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,760
accompanies the so-called effect, and that we've not actually established a causal relationship.

89
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Three, the error of imaginary causes. We invent causes based on a sensation or a mental state,

90
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,440
and Nietzsche says that this is in order to justify that mental state. And finally,

91
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,840
four, the error of free will. A specific example of such an error in our causal thinking.

92
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,280
And on closer inspection, the error of free will points to a more profound error,

93
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,080
that we establish such cause and effect relationships such as the ego causing one's actions

94
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,360
because of a psychological necessity, the perceived consequences of believing in this

95
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,440
causal relationship, the consequences of holding the belief, or the consequences of not holding the

96
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,880
belief. That's what actually motivates the belief itself, or perceived or imagined consequences

97
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,080
of if we hold the belief what happens, if we don't hold the belief what happens,

98
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,000
what are the consequences for humanity. So, confusing cause and effect, false causality,

99
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
imaginary causes, and then freedom of the will. With that introduction, let's look to the passage.

100
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,520
The beginning of the four great errors concerns the error of confusing cause and effect,

101
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:04,160
and Nietzsche explains this error through the example of Alvice Cornaro. So, Cornaro is a writer

102
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,120
and an architect during the Italian Renaissance period. He's born in the 15th century in Padua,

103
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,720
although the exact date of his birth is disputed, and I bring this up because it's disputed for

104
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,880
an interesting reason which we'll discuss in a moment, but Cornaro is born sometime between the

105
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:32,000
1460s and the 1480s, and he lived until 1566. Although he's related to a noble family from

106
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,760
Venice, Cornaro is merely the son of an innkeeper. He would sort of draw upon that relation to

107
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,680
nobility because of the prestige of it, but in fact, he's from a lesser branch of the family,

108
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,560
but he's able to take what little money his family had and became a rather successful entrepreneur.

109
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,160
He's a somewhat interesting character, actually. He had little scientific training.

110
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,920
He attended university in Venice, but he dropped out because he felt that the education he received

111
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,120
was overly philosophical. It was disconnected from practical knowledge, which tells us something

112
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,760
about him right there. He made his fortune by obtaining permission to attempt to reclaim land

113
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,440
from the lagoon near Venice on the Adriatic Sea. So, what Cornaro does is he successfully applied

114
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:33,840
the science of hydraulics to turn this portion of the lagoon into wheat fields and fishing ponds.

115
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,240
This is good for Cornaro as a business venture, and it's good for the city because the lagoon,

116
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,560
it causes swarms of insects in the summertime and winter fogs. It smells terrible. There's just

117
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,520
all sorts of problems. It's much better to have wheat fields and fishing ponds next to your city

118
00:12:51,520 --> 00:13:01,840
than a stinky, hazardous lagoon. So, after this, Cornaro publishes a treatise on water management,

119
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,800
and he would go on to become a patron of the arts with the wealth that he made from

120
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,880
ventures like this, and he is credited with introducing the Roman Renaissance style of

121
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,400
architecture into Northern Italy. None of this is why Cornaro is of interest to Nietzsche,

122
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:25,040
by the way. Nietzsche's fascination with the example of Cornaro is due to a series of treatises

123
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,680
that he published later in his life. Cornaro is known as a humanist to this very day because he

124
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,760
attacked a prejudice that was common in medieval European society and had lingered. It was popular

125
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,480
up to his own time, and this is the view that old age is nothing but a period of pain and decay.

126
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,880
You know, this is the harsh winter of life. The years that you spend as an elderly person

127
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:58,000
are not but suffering, and that this is in some way simply the natural order of human life. That

128
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,640
you should expect this and endure it stoically, but just know that when you get to old age,

129
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,760
it's going to be a bad time. You know, you can rejoice because your body is about to be

130
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,040
rejuvenated in heaven, but it's more or less accepted that one's physical existence at the

131
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,960
end of their natural life is, well, bad. Cornaro lives to a very old age, and he says on the contrary,

132
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,000
one's elderly years are the most beautiful period of life. He says that God wills all of us to live

133
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,560
long and healthy lives, and to live to reach this best age of one's lifetime, because in old age,

134
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,760
all of your accumulated wisdom allows you to see the world with new eyes or with just a better,

135
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,080
higher perspective than the youth have on life. And so, Cornaro becomes a kind of health and

136
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:59,920
longevity advocate, and he lives to either his 90s or to be over 100 years old, his exact age

137
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,600
when he dies is disputed because we have various birth dates for him, with some sources saying he

138
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:16,400
was born in 1464, although it seems more likely he was born in the 1480s. That's just my belief

139
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,720
that as Cornaro becomes a sort of guru on longevity, people begin to overestimate his age. It becomes

140
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,400
exaggerated just how old this man lived to be. That's not an unusual phenomenon at all. It's

141
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,640
very common among, for example, Taoist sages or Zen masters in the East. In any case, he did live to

142
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,680
a very old age for somebody living in the 15th century, and so we finally come to the main point

143
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,840
on which Nietzsche will use Cornaro in order to demonstrate a great error in thinking. Cornaro

144
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,880
began to suffer from gastrointestinal problems and feverishness when he was around 35 years old.

145
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,360
His doctors advised him to eat a very sparse diet, and Cornaro restricted himself to 12 ounces of

146
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:10,000
food a day. Bread, egg yolk, meat, and soup, and 14 ounces of wine every day. So when he was in his

147
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,040
80s, he was asked to write a treatise on his secret to longevity, and Cornaro attributed his

148
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:24,320
good health to this diet. And Cornaro genuinely believed that liberality in one's diet, gluttonous

149
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,800
consumption of food and drink, he says this is contrary to the will of God, and this is evidenced

150
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,480
by the fact that it shortens your life. By living virtuously, by consuming only the caloric intake

151
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,680
that you absolutely need, one earns a long life. And it's worth noting, aside from this religious

152
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,880
or moral dimension of Cornaro's thought, this popular wisdom of caloric reduction

153
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,280
would remain in the zeitgeist for hundreds of years afterwards. This was true up through Nietzsche's

154
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:08,560
time. The popular wisdom that Nietzsche calls coronarism is not really overturned until the 20th

155
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:16,240
century. And so now the passage Nietzsche writes, quote, everyone knows the book of the famous Cornaro

156
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,880
in which he recommends his slender diet as a recipe for a long and happy life, a virtuous one too.

157
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,880
Few books have been read so much, even now thousands of copies are sold in England every year.

158
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,560
I do not doubt that scarcely any book, except the Bible as is made, has done as much harm,

159
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:44,560
has shortened as many lives as this well-intentioned curiosity. The reason? The mistaking of the

160
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,360
effect for the cause. The worthy Italian thought his diet was the cause of his long life, whereas the

161
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,760
precondition for a long life, the extraordinary slowness of his metabolism, the consumption of

162
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,760
so little was the cause of his slender diet. He was not free to eat little or much. His frugality

163
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,200
was not a matter of, quote, unquote, free will. He became sick when he ate more. But whoever is

164
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,920
no carp not only does well to eat properly, but needs to, a scholar in our own time with his

165
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,200
rapid consumption of nervous energy, would simply destroy himself with Cornaro's diet,

166
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:34,560
crede experto, end quote. That last line means, believe him who has tried, credit the expert.

167
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,120
So implicitly, Nietzsche is tying himself to the type of the nervous modern scholarly type.

168
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,120
At least he was at one time during his professor days. So again, who says that Nietzsche can't

169
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,440
take a shot at himself every once in a while. In any case, as we've discussed many times on the

170
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,200
podcast, Nietzsche spent quite a lot of time experimenting with his own diet. He believed

171
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,600
there was a very real link between your overall physical and mental health. And that one's daily

172
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,360
habits, your daily intake of food, you shouldn't simply go about these things thoughtlessly.

173
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,240
The question of Nietzsche's own diet and his views on diet are somewhat fascinating,

174
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,040
but the key point to understand about this is that Nietzsche has come to understand something

175
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,840
that I think most nutritionists today would agree with. There is no universal diet. Now,

176
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,520
this doesn't mean there's no definite claim that we can make about what is healthy and unhealthy

177
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,440
in general. But different people have different physiological needs, different lifestyles,

178
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,320
just different restrictions on what they can or should eat for their best health.

179
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,280
And Nietzsche learns that through first hand experience. He also sees that the eating habits

180
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,040
of European countries differ dramatically, such as when he compares the eating habits of Germans

181
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,880
to that of the Italians and so on. As a result, he's able to see that Coronaro's diet can't be a

182
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,760
panacea, that in fact, it was right for Coronaro, but that it would not be right for many others.

183
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,800
And if this is the case, this means that Coronaro's diet may have shortened a few lives

184
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:19,440
rather than lengthened them, that people with a higher caloric need might have fallen victim to

185
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,800
thinking that, you know, Coronaro's diet is the cause of his longevity. As I noted earlier,

186
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,040
this isn't a critique of cause and effect as such. In fact, Nietzsche says that Coronaro's

187
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,640
longevity is the cause of his diet. If you pay attention, that's actually a very funny claim,

188
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:44,160
but he makes it quite clear a slow metabolism is the cause of a long life. This kind of thinking

189
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,720
in Nietzsche, by the way, goes all the way back to his lectures in the pre-plotonics,

190
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,440
where he references the thought experiment by the philosopher of science, von Baer,

191
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,000
in which it is imagined that pulse rate correlates with one's experience of the passage of time.

192
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,880
That is one hypothesis that as far as I understand has not been borne out in terms of

193
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,280
modern scientific knowledge, as Nietzsche's insights on nutrition perhaps have. But that said,

194
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,600
this colors Nietzsche's thinking, there's a speed to one's physiological existence, that we can

195
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,760
measure the existence of a phenomena, in some sense, by the tempo at which it manifests.

196
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,920
But if Coronaro's metabolism is what causes his long life, his slow rate of metabolizing

197
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:40,000
sort of equates to a slow and long-lived existence, then that means that his physiology,

198
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,680
what he is, is what accounts for his dietary needs. And in spite of all the unanswered questions that

199
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,800
still remain concerning diet even to this day, it seems quite clear that on an epistemological level,

200
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,960
the causal relationship has not been established here. That if we are to admit that once diet

201
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,160
depends on their physiology, then is their physiology not the cause of their optimal diet

202
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,200
rather than the optimal diet, the cause of the state of their physiology? We could of course say

203
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,640
that living at variance with your optimal diet could be the cause of an early death, or living

204
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,080
in accord with your optimal diet is the cause of a long life. But in that case, couldn't we just

205
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,160
take the argument a step further? Why can't this person eat only according to their ideal diet?

206
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:35,280
Maybe somebody really needs to have just red meat and potatoes and vegetables,

207
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,920
why is it that they're always eating junk food? Well, maybe they have no impulse control. So why

208
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,640
do they not have good impulse control? Isn't there a physiological reason for that too?

209
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,120
Something about just their nature that makes them crave junk food and so on and so on, right?

210
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,480
It's very hard to draw the line at a certain point and say, this is the final cause. That's one of

211
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,680
the things that's sort of implicit behind this critique of our causal thinking is that in some

212
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,000
sense, it's always arbitrary where we say, no, this is the cause. Somebody can always come along

213
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,360
and say, okay, but what's the cause of that? And this answer doesn't satisfy us with our common

214
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,640
sense wisdom, right? Why is it not satisfying? It's because we've been taught a certain mental

215
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,240
framework throughout our whole lives that tells us exactly the opposite. And Nietzsche says that

216
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,840
this radical idea here is pointing to this very error is the first example of his revaluation

217
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,480
of all values. He writes that quote, the most general formula on which every religion and

218
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,640
morality is founded, quote, do this and that, refrain from this and that, then you will be happy.

219
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:00,160
Otherwise, end quote. That's what Nietzsche calls the original sin of reason in this passage in

220
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,440
Twilight of Idols. But I should note here that this tendency and thought was observed by Nietzsche

221
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,480
as early as human all to human. It's what he characterized there as one of the most common

222
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,080
false conclusions arrived at by human reason. For the sake of comparison with the four great

223
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,640
errors, let's look at section 227 of human all to human, where Nietzsche writes quote, Christianity,

224
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,160
which was very innocent in its intellectual ideas, demanded faith and nothing but faith,

225
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,160
and passionately rejected the desire for reasons. It pointed to the successful result of faith.

226
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,840
You'll soon discover the advantage of faith is suggested. You'll be blessed because of it.

227
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,160
The state, in fact, does the same thing, and each father raises his son in the same way.

228
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Just take this to be true, he says. You'll discover how good it feels.

229
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,760
But this means that the truth of an opinion should be proved by its personal benefit.

230
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,640
The usefulness of a teaching should guarantee its intellectual certainty

231
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,120
and substantiation. This is as if the defendant were to say in court,

232
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,600
my defender is telling the whole truth for just see what happens as a result of his plea. I am

233
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:23,440
acquitted. End quote. So Nietzsche's point here, and human all to human, is that the proof for a

234
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,440
given proposition in this formula is the happiness that the proposition creates. Do this and you

235
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,120
will be happy. Believe this, you will discover how good it feels. The church called this the proof by

236
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,400
pleasure. Nietzsche's point in human all to human is much more straightforward than it is in the

237
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,440
Four Great Errors passage in Twilight of Idols. In human all to human Nietzsche is simply exposing

238
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,560
the fact that this is a paralogism, a false syllogism that does not serve as proof of anything.

239
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,160
Nietzsche's point here is simply this reasoning is false. It's incredibly common,

240
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,120
but nonetheless it's false. Another example of human fallibility and reasoning often covered over

241
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,600
by moralizing driven by a psychological need. So it's typical of the critiques we find in this

242
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:19,760
book. Our reasoning here is human all to human. In the Four Great Errors passage, this proof by

243
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,160
happiness is examined on another basis. The fact that the proof by happiness is a confusion of the

244
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:33,680
effect for the cause. Why is this? Because like with Coronaro's diet in which slow metabolism,

245
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,520
you know, a physiology with natural longevity is actually the cause of one's sparse intake of

246
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,560
calories. Nietzsche argues here that one's happiness is the cause of their virtue, not virtue, the

247
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:53,120
cause of their happiness. That some people are by their very nature, by their very constitution,

248
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,200
happy. The reason why a person lives happily is the same reason that they live virtuously because

249
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,200
of what they are, which means that once again, when we promise that virtuous living creates

250
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,640
happiness, we're reasoning based on a causal chain that we haven't actually established.

251
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,480
Nietzsche writes in Twilight of Idols quote,

252
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,320
A well turned out human being, a happy one, must perform certain actions and shrinks instinctively

253
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,400
from other actions. He carries the order which he represents physiologically into his relations with

254
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,640
other human beings and things. In a formula, his virtue is the effect of his happiness.

255
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,680
A long life, many descendants, this is not the wages of virtue, rather virtue itself

256
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,000
is that slowing down of the metabolism, which leads, among other things, also to a long life,

257
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,080
many descendants, in short, to cornerism. The church and morality say,

258
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,040
A generation, a people are destroyed by license and luxury. My recovered reason says,

259
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,760
When a people approaches destruction, when it degenerates physiologically, then license and

260
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:15,280
luxury follow from this, namely the craving for ever stronger and more frequent stimulation,

261
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:22,320
as every exhausted nature knows it. This young man turns pale early in wilts, his friends say,

262
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,400
Well, that is due to this or that disease. I say, that he became diseased, that he did not resist

263
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,880
the disease, was already the effect of an impoverished life or hereditary exhaustion.

264
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,880
The newspaper reader says, The party destroys itself by making such a mistake.

265
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,240
My higher politics says, A party which makes such mistakes has reached its end.

266
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:59,040
It has lost the sureness of instinct. Every mistake, in every sense, is the effect

267
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,960
of the degeneration of instinct, of the disintegration of the will. One could almost

268
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:14,080
define what is bad in this way. All that is good is instinct, and hence easy, necessary, free.

269
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,160
Laboriousness is an objection. The God is typically different from the hero. In my language,

270
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,480
light feet are the first attribute of divinity.

271
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,760
End quote. When I read passages like that one in Twilight of Idols, it is almost daunting to

272
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,600
try and unpack it, as they say, because Nietzsche has already condensed everything down to the finest

273
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:47,520
subtlest version of the point. But Nietzsche asserts here, Virtue is an effect of happiness,

274
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,960
which is a revaluation because it completely inverts the moralist narrative that happiness

275
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,440
only comes as an effect of virtue. This is why Nietzsche says at the beginning of the

276
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,680
four great errors, that this erroneous thinking is hollowed by the names religion and morality.

277
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,120
Because all religion, all morality is based on this proposed causal relation,

278
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,680
where virtue is the cause and happiness the effect. Whether it is the Christian duty to turn away

279
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,600
from your sins, or the Buddhist abandonment of desire, or the Muslim submission to God,

280
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:28,000
whether it is the deontologist who speaks of moral obligations, or the utilitarian who

281
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,360
preaches the greatest good for the greatest many, or Socrates telling us that eudaimonia

282
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,040
arises from living virtuously. Really, it is with Socrates that Nietzsche finds the

283
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,520
philosopher of this formula. Nietzsche writes in another section of Twilight of Idols,

284
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,960
the problem of Socrates, quote, I tried to understand the idiosyncrasy from which the

285
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,640
Socratic equation, reason equals virtue equals happiness, could have arisen,

286
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:04,240
the weirdest equation I've ever seen, and one which was essentially opposed to all the instincts

287
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,960
of the older Hellenes, end quote. So once again, Nietzsche would probably suggest that

288
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,760
his notion that happiness is the cause and virtue the effect is closer to the older Greekism,

289
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,160
as he called it, the idea that the good man was good by nature, and thus acted good by nature,

290
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,560
had good feelings by nature, had a healthy diet by nature, was virtuous by nature.

291
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,880
And so to return to the four great errors passage, this is why Nietzsche says that a God has light

292
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,720
feet, because for the person with that natural goodness in them, virtuous actions don't come

293
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,720
as a labor. They don't have to force themselves. They don't have to tyrannize over themselves

294
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,720
in order to comport themselves in a just or admirable way, or to be generous or courageous people.

295
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,320
If that is a burden, it already indicates a disintegrating instinct, a failing health.

296
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Nietzsche then gives a series of examples of the opposite. That one's health is not destroyed by

297
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,360
vice, but one engages in vice because of their failing health. That applies on a societal scale.

298
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,160
This is a point in Nietzsche that oftentimes, I would say both his reactionary interpreters

299
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,400
and his leftist critics fail to understand. Nietzsche would completely disagree with anyone

300
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,600
who thought that the answer to decadence, that is the decline of a civilization,

301
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,640
is to institute some program of virtue, that we're going to get everyone back on the same page,

302
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,920
get everyone to begin acting virtuously again, and through this reinstill the old values of the dying

303
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,880
or dead traditions, and that this will then rejuvenate our society. Because not only is this

304
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,040
remedy sure to fail, on a deeper level, the entire proposition is based on that erroneous

305
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:06,080
perception, that vice, depraved behavior, sexual license, luxury, and so on, that these are the

306
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,520
cause of society's downfall. Nietzsche says no, the society's downfall causes those things.

307
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:22,400
The reason? Physiology expanded to a grand scale. The declining physiology always needs

308
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,000
greater and greater stimulation in order to feel anything at all. The same way we might compare

309
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,480
to the taste buds of older people begin to wane, the same way you simply don't get the same thrill

310
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,440
out of something pleasurable, the thousandth time that you do it as you did on the first or the

311
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,120
second time. Furthermore, errors in judgment, errors in thinking, mistakes, these are again

312
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,600
sourced to be the cause of one's downfall. One really Nietzsche's point is if you had been on

313
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,800
top of your game, you wouldn't have made the mistake at all. The mistake didn't cause you to

314
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,560
fail. It's like when in a game of chess you say, you know, I lost because I blundered one of my

315
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,120
pieces. But why did you blunder one of your pieces in the first place? You know, well then you might

316
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,480
say, well because I was tired or I wasn't paying attention. Or I based my move on an instinct

317
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,120
that turned out to be wrong. Sometimes players who are on the verge of defeat just start to

318
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,920
blunder piece after piece. They get irritated and they make riskier moves to try and regain the

319
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:29,520
advantage and they just lose piece after piece after piece. And so too with the political chess

320
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,200
game with the geopolitical chess game, you know, with a political party, they're defeated not because

321
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,680
they politically miscalculated, they miscalculate because they're on the verge of defeat.

322
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,120
So I think those are all very helpful examples. Now we come to the second error.

323
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,760
The error of false causality. In this error, Nietzsche probes a bit further into our whole

324
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,840
manner of thinking about cause and effect. And he asks, where do we get our faith that we know

325
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,280
what a cause is? And this is a serious logical challenge, I would think, to put to most people

326
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,720
with such common sense notions in their head as to how they come to designate something as a cause

327
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,880
and something else as the effect. Aside from however we might go about logically establishing

328
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,160
this, Nietzsche says, if you want to know the actual reason why people possess this faith and

329
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,440
causality, he thinks it comes from, quote, the realm of the famous inner facts, of which not a

330
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,080
single one has so far been proved to be factual. We believe ourselves to be causal in the act of

331
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:44,800
willing. We thought that here at least we caught causality in the act. Nor did one doubt that

332
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,600
all the antecedents of an act, its causes, were to be sought in consciousness would be found there

333
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:59,600
once sought as motives. Else one would not have been free and responsible for it. Finally, who

334
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:06,800
would have denied that a thought is caused? That the ego causes the thought, end quote.

335
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,400
So this faith and causality, it comes from our own inner experience of willing.

336
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,440
We perceive that our thoughts, our motives have a cause, which is the ego, and that these motives

337
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,680
then cause our actions. But as Nietzsche says, this is a faith. And that is because it's derived

338
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,640
from an intuition. It's derived from a feeling, just a sense that we have that we're the cause of

339
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,560
ourselves and the cause of our actions. But it's not established by evidence or reasoned argument.

340
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,840
It was simply taken as a given that such inner facts are to be taken as true because

341
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,520
what could be more of an immediate certainty than our own perceptions and our own inner feelings.

342
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,800
But Nietzsche thinks there's a mistake here. He says that the so-called motive is an error

343
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,920
because it is, quote, merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something alongside the deed

344
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,280
that is more likely to cover up the antecedents of the deeds than to represent them, end quote.

345
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,320
And Nietzsche says of the alleged origin of our motives, the ego, that it has become, quote,

346
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,440
a fable, a fiction, a play on words. It has altogether ceased to think, feel, or will, end quote.

347
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,800
What Nietzsche means here is that the ego is a narrator, which gives

348
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,280
post hoc explanations for the actions of the organism, which in truth are, quote, unquote,

349
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:45,200
willed by impulses, which are unconscious. This notion of the self, first seriously proposed by

350
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,960
Nietzsche, would later be expanded into the psychoanalytic school of thought, led by Freud,

351
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,760
carried on by Jung and many others. So the thinking, feeling, and willing does not originate in the ego

352
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,320
in this new understanding. The ego is this self-image, this constantly self-creating narrator

353
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:11,040
that is attempting to make sense of and justify the actions that are thought, felt, and willed

354
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,280
by unconscious drives. So the ego is not the cause of motives. And motives, as the consciously

355
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,720
articulated explanation for how we act, Nietzsche writes, quote, merely accompanies events. It can

356
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,480
also be absent, end quote. So what is our justification for saying the motive is the cause? In other words,

357
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,880
the motive accompanies the event, yes, the motive that we consciously narrate to ourselves,

358
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,880
accompanies whatever act or deed we are doing, but he says it can also be absent from it.

359
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,320
That's a strange thought, taking an action but with no

360
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,960
conscious motive. But nevertheless, I'm sure almost all of us have had something like this

361
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,440
experience. I mean, when you do something and then later you come to the realization,

362
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,680
I don't know why I did that, right? Shouldn't it be impossible to have that thought? And yet

363
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,560
many people have that thought. Perhaps if we know ourselves fairly well, you know,

364
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,240
you might be able to come up with an explanation after the fact, but that wouldn't change

365
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,240
having the experience of doing something without being conscious of our motives. And if that's the

366
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,400
case, then could conscious motive really be the cause of action? Or is it merely an accompanying

367
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:36,000
phenomenon, not the cause? So in other words, an event happens, several phenomena occur,

368
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,240
we have a human action, and accompanying that phenomenon, we have the conscious subject who is

369
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,640
taking the action, we have the conscious subject's understanding of their motive for the action.

370
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,920
What is the cause of the action taking place? Nietzsche says that by attributing it to the

371
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,840
motive or to the ego consciousness, we've just leapt to an unjustifiable conclusion.

372
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,680
In light of Nietzsche's new appraisal of the self that would become powerfully influential

373
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,840
on the psychoanalysts, Nietzsche writes, quote, there are no mental causes at all.

374
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,720
The whole of the allegedly empirical evidence for that has gone to the devil, end quote.

375
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,960
But then Nietzsche goes on to suggest that this belief in mental causes is at the root of our

376
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,440
notion of being. What do I mean by that? Well, when we designate a quote unquote cause, we always

377
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,440
have to essentialize events as things. The reason for this is that the entire mental

378
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,720
framework of cause and effect has to separate the effect from the cause, or else it would be

379
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,960
nonsensical. So it has to create a doer and then the deed, a subject, and then the action the subject

380
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,640
takes. But as Nietzsche argues in genealogy of morality, when he says that this is like separating

381
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,040
the lightning from the flash, that's simply a grammatical faith. When we say the lightning

382
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,080
causes the flash, we're saying nothing at all there. We're simply taking an event that happened,

383
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,480
a series of sensations that we had, maybe it's sensations of a routinely repeated and even

384
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,240
scientifically understood phenomenon like lightning. But nevertheless, we're taking an event that

385
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,760
happened, which is inseparable from the process that creates that event. It's all the same thing,

386
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,440
one big process, one big happening, one big becoming. And we're distilling out of that,

387
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,920
a subject that does the thing. Further down in the passage Nietzsche continues quote,

388
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,480
all that happened was considered a doing, all doing the effect of a will. The world became to

389
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,920
it a multiplicity of doers, a doer, a subject was slipped under all that happened. It was out of

390
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,640
himself that man projected his three inner facts, that in which he believed most firmly, the will,

391
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,920
the spirit, the ego. He even took the concept of being from the concept of the ego, he posited

392
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,920
things as being as a cause, small wonder that later he always found in things only that which he had

393
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,960
put into them. The thing itself to say it once more, the concept of thing is a mere reflex of the

394
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:29,120
faith and the ego as a cause. And even your atom, my dear mechanists and physicists, how much error,

395
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,640
how much rudimentary psychology is still residual in your atom end quote.

396
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,280
So when we slip being beneath everything, that is the creation of the doer that does the deed,

397
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,800
the lightning that does the flashing. Nietzsche's suggestion here is that this is a kind of sly

398
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,480
trickery, it's like a magic trick, sliding the card that the audience member revealed to you

399
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,000
back under the deck, right? That's what we have done with all phenomena. All that is given about

400
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,560
a phenomena is sensation, that's all we know of the world, what is given to us by the senses.

401
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:12,000
And we are by no means justified in positing being on that basis. These sensations are caused by

402
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,960
definite separate things with their own essence, that is sort of the best I can do it, positing the

403
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,200
ordinary notion of being. But we create the sense through our language, through the creation of the

404
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:32,000
thing, the subject, the object. This relates to atomism because the atomist is trying to discover

405
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,120
in some sense, the smallest thing, the bedrock of physical existence, the smallest possible particle,

406
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,480
the smallest unit of matter. Because if we were to discover that, we could then say that something

407
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:51,040
is real, something is existent in the way a platonic form exists, the atom is this thing,

408
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,920
the atom is that enduring unity that we always indicate when we indicate being. And thus, whatever

409
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,160
you may think of atomism, Nietzsche's point here is that the same tendency to think of the world in

410
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:12,080
terms of being is the same psychological undergirding of that atomist project. Fundamentally, this is

411
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:18,960
the same thing that undergirds the Theists project. He's articulating the same faith when he makes

412
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,840
spirit the cause of reality. God is the cause of reality. And here that prejudice is articulated

413
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,520
in the same form as its origin, reality as caused by the will of a thinking subject.

414
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,920
That intuition of being a thing that thinks, that's the reason for this type of error,

415
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,160
slipping that thing-ness, that being underneath the ego itself. And so we may say that in the

416
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:51,520
second great error, Nietzsche has gone farther in critiquing causal thinking itself. The third error,

417
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:58,160
that of imaginary causes, may at first appear to be less of an attack on causality than, you know,

418
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,440
simply another misapplication of causality. But as we get into this third error, I think it will

419
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:11,200
become clear there is a even further critique, an even deeper critique here as well. The error of

420
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,760
imaginary causes is best exemplified by dreams. Nietzsche here, again, returns to musings, which

421
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,960
he first put to the page in human all too human, and which were later revisited by Freud in his

422
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,320
work The Interpretation of Dreams. It's a well-known phenomenon that dreamers will experience external

423
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:35,120
stimuli of some kind, such as a loud sound, light flickering on their eyes, or as is the case in

424
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,320
some of Freud's experiments being tickled with a feather while you sleep, and the dreamer will

425
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:46,160
incorporate that sensation into the logic of the dream. Nietzsche writes, quote,

426
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:54,560
A cause is slipped under a particular sensation. For example, one following a far off canon shot,

427
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,280
often a whole little novel in which the dreamer turns up as the protagonist. The sensation endures

428
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:07,360
meanwhile in a kind of resonance. It waits as it were until the causal instinct permits it to step

429
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:14,800
into the foreground, now no longer as a chance occurrence, but as meaning. The canon shot appears

430
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:22,160
in a causal mode, in an apparent reversal of time. What is really later, the motivation,

431
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:29,280
is experienced first, often with a hundred details which pass like lightning, and the shot follows.

432
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:36,240
What has happened? The representations which were produced by a certain state have been

433
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:43,280
misunderstood as its causes, end quote. So the interesting thing about the dreaming mind

434
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,560
is the way in which a sensation is represented to the dreaming subject as a cause of events which

435
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,680
are entirely scripted and represented by the mind alone, for the mind alone. That the events in the

436
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:02,000
dream are not in fact caused by the canon shot. The canon shot is simply incorporated as the cause

437
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,640
as an event with meaning. The representations that were produced according to the logic of the dream

438
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,000
come from the motivating drives, the entire cacophony of all the organs and impulses within the

439
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,440
dreamer. And dreams also have that funny way of playing with time, as we all know from the film

440
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Inception for example, in which some sense impression the dreamer receives can persist,

441
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,840
resonate as Nietzsche says here, and then be explained after the fact by the dreaming mind.

442
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,440
Which Nietzsche is comparing to the way that we represent the world, our sense organs interact

443
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,240
with our mind in such a way as to produce a representation. The representation of course

444
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,960
comes after the initial stimulus, but Nietzsche says in the logic of the dream this is precisely

445
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,320
reversed, and where Nietzsche makes another radical claim, another challenge to the common sense

446
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:59,680
wisdom is in the following paragraph, quote, In fact, we do the same thing when awake. Most of

447
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,160
our general feelings, every kind of inhibition, pressure, tension, and explosion in the play

448
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,360
and counterplay of our organs, and particularly in the state of the nervous sympathicus,

449
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,680
excite our causal instinct. We want to have a reason for feeling this way or that,

450
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,960
for feeling bad, or feeling good. We are never satisfied merely to state the fact that we feel

451
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,520
this way or that, we admit this fact only, become conscious of it only, and we have furnished some

452
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:38,800
kind of motivation. Memory, which swings into action in such cases, unknown to us, brings up

453
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,760
earlier states of the same kind, together with the causal interpretations associated with them,

454
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:52,240
not their real causes, end quote. This I think is imminently relatable, because for one I think

455
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,840
it's fairly common, it's a fairly common experience that sometimes you just wake up and feel,

456
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:04,640
for lack of a more descriptive word, happy. You're just having a good day, and you can't even find

457
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,360
any particular reason for it. Or maybe you wake up in a bad mood, you know, you woke up in the

458
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,080
wrong side of the bed, as we say, and then a friend asks you, why are you in such a bad mood?

459
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:21,520
And then what happens? You begin to search for reasons, some sort of consciously experienced

460
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:27,200
or consciously articulated cause for why you're in a given mental state or in a given mood.

461
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,800
And the memory begins to present you with all these possibilities. Here's why you might feel

462
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,840
that way. And as Nietzsche coins the phrase, and beyond good and evil, there might not be such a

463
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:44,160
fine distinction between finding and inventing, Finden und Erfinden, as these words are in German.

464
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,040
There's not as much of a difference between that as those two things, as we would like to think.

465
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,840
Now it's worth noting that in some sense, one could make the argument that it's actually the

466
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,760
point of memory to give you answers to the question, why do I feel this way? Like specifically

467
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,480
answering that question, that's one of the main tasks of memory, because one of the main advantages

468
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,000
of being a remembering organism is that when something isn't working for us, we can course

469
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,960
correct, we can say, I feel bad all the time. What am I doing that's making me feel bad?

470
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,520
And that's an indisputably useful function of memory, because an animal with no self-consciousness

471
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,280
across time doesn't have access to that kind of self-awareness. It might know I feel bad in the

472
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,480
moment. But if you can't string moments together and bring to mind the fact I felt bad every

473
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,480
single day for a week now, then course correction becomes difficult, if not impossible. And so this

474
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:45,280
is the main use of memory is actually to ask that question. But this is where the Nietzschean

475
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,000
critique of our notions of truth, given the context that we are biological

476
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,560
creatures that were physiological creatures. This is where that comes into play, because then

477
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:01,840
there's sort of a difficult question that is raised in the wake of this. Does memory actually

478
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:09,120
establish a firm empirical foundation for positing causal relationships between external events and

479
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:15,680
how we feel? All memory can do is correlate together all the times I felt a certain way,

480
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,480
and then ask what events preceded that. But can we actually say with certainty that the events

481
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,800
that preceded the way we feel caused that feeling? And if we can't say that with certainty, which I

482
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,840
think would follow from Nietzsche's argument so far, then tracing over all our past memories will

483
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,880
actually not bring us closer to any sort of certainty. It will simply remind us of past

484
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,160
interpretations we've made, past conscious explanations that we've given to ourselves,

485
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,760
post hoc, as to why that we feel the way that we do. And if every one of those past interpretations

486
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,360
was just as erroneous as the one prior to it, this kind of mental habit actually gets us nowhere.

487
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:59,520
The truth for Nietzsche is that there's this whole interplay of forces in our physiology,

488
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,880
that blind contest of impulses and drives. This is, in truth, why we feel the way we do.

489
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,840
But because none of those causal factors are actually conscious to us, none of them are freely

490
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:17,760
chosen to say this, to bring this to our attention, as Nietzsche does, as the equivalent of saying,

491
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:24,720
well, you simply feel this way, and that is that. But that's not satisfying, right?

492
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,800
That explanation, or frankly, that non-explanation, is not satisfying. And why? Well, Nietzsche says

493
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,200
there's a psychological explanation for why it's not satisfying, and it's fairly simple.

494
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:43,120
To locate a cause is to make known the unknown, and this quote relieves

495
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:49,520
comforts and satisfies, besides giving a feeling of power, end quote. When we're confronted by

496
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,280
an event beyond our control or understanding, the least we can do in order to not feel overwhelmed

497
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,280
by this is to explain why it is the event is happening, to give the event a meaning. Simply put,

498
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,040
to remain in a situation in which we're surrounded by the unknown is terrifying,

499
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,320
and the mind starts to grab for a cause in order to abolish the sense of terror,

500
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:18,080
like sort of grasping at vines to claw our way out of that pit, right? And so Nietzsche writes,

501
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:26,480
quote, first principle, any explanation is better than none. Since at bottom, it is merely a matter

502
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,320
of wishing to be rid of oppressive representations, one is not too particular about the means of

503
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:38,880
getting rid of them. The first representation that explains the unknown as familiar feels so good

504
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:46,560
that one quote considers it true, the proof of pleasure, of strength, as a criterion of truth,

505
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:54,480
end quote. We return to that old bad habit in drawing conclusions that Nietzsche wrote about

506
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,200
way back in human all too human, the proof by pleasure, believe this because it feels good,

507
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,720
in this case, because it abolishes that which feels bad, the sense of the unknown.

508
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,240
It doesn't even have to be a good explanation, any explanation that delivers us from the fear of

509
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,120
the unknown. The first one that seems to work as a cause, we will pick that explanation as soon

510
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:23,840
as possible, so that we can stop thinking about it. Nietzsche goes on to say, of course,

511
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,520
that we will adopt familiar causes over anything strange, over anything never experienced before.

512
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,720
Whatever we have already inscribed into memory and labeled as a cause will be our go to,

513
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,320
and memory will habituate this kind of thinking as a heuristic for future encounters with the

514
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:47,360
unknown. The lingering doubt, the mysterious, the unexplained, this is in many ways a torment,

515
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,120
causal thinking is a delivery from that torment, but that doesn't make it true, it just makes it

516
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:58,480
pleasurable. See, this is the the radical critique that Nietzsche is giving us about the structure

517
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:05,360
of our thought. Why we think the things that we do, as Deleuze would put it, truth is not an

518
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:11,360
element of thought. Nietzsche here is saying pleasure is the use of familiar habitual thought

519
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:16,960
patterns is pleasurable, which is why once this error in thought seeps into our thinking, we just

520
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,880
continue in it insensibly. There's a dimension of this in our own individual psychology as well,

521
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:29,920
Nietzsche writes, quote, one kind of positing of causes predominates more and more, is concentrated

522
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,560
into a system and finally emerges as dominant, that is, as simply precluding other causes and

523
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:44,800
explanations. The banker immediately thinks of business, the Christian of sin, and the girl

524
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:52,560
of her love, end quote. This kind of habituated thought pattern is a common error all its own,

525
00:55:53,280 --> 00:56:00,000
albeit only a subset of this great error. But we've all seen it, I'm sure, the political activist for

526
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,320
whom the cause of everything in life is political, whatever the problem is, that was because of the

527
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,360
politics of the other side, whatever the solution is, or whatever good thing we have going on in

528
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,400
society, that's because of the politics of my side, every single problem is considered politically,

529
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,680
everything is assumed to be the result of this one system of causes, which is dominant in their

530
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:28,560
thought, and so they ignore all the other causes. Or we might think of the paranoiac, the person who's

531
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:34,240
dominated by paranoid suspicions and fears. They have an internal problem, they have their own

532
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:40,320
pathology, their own excessive blood of fearful and suspicious feelings, but they find the causes

533
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:46,640
of those feelings projected onto the external world. I'm fearful and suspicious not because I'm

534
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:51,760
paranoid, but because I'm being followed, right? Anything that happens in such a person's life

535
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,480
can be explained by some malevolent external force, some person that they're suspicious of,

536
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,600
and on and on. Carl Jung's notion that everything within the psyche that remains unconscious becomes

537
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:11,440
projected onto the world, and seen as a sort of external force or external actor, that idea

538
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,640
bears mentioning here because it resembles Nietzsche's idea in this passage. Everything

539
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:23,440
beneath the surface of consciousness is worked into the same familiar framework and projected onto

540
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:30,080
an external cause. Nietzsche goes on to argue that, quote, the whole realm of morality and religion

541
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:36,480
belongs under this concept of imaginary causes, end quote. And what Nietzsche means by this is

542
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,240
quite clear when we look at the concept of sin. How would Nietzsche regard sin, given the critiques

543
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:49,040
he's made so far about our causal thinking, our misapplications of causality? Well, he says the

544
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:56,080
feeling of sin is, quote, slipped under a physiological discomfort. One always finds reasons

545
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:04,160
for being dissatisfied with oneself, end quote. This kind of critique harkens back to the genealogy

546
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:12,480
of morals, in which Nietzsche says that the priest tells his flock, you sickly sheep, you are to blame

547
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,120
for your own suffering. Nietzsche wonders in that work how it is that such a sick ideology,

548
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:25,760
such as the ascetic ideal, could ever take hold. And this third great error is one of the elements

549
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,920
of that. The dismal workshop of the psyche that Christianity establishes, in which guilt is actually

550
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,760
heightened, the individuals made to work at making himself feel guiltier and guiltier.

551
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,400
This workshop gets going with the fuel of Rosentum all directed by the priest,

552
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:50,320
but its operations follow the formula as laid out here in the error of imaginary causes. That is

553
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:56,880
its structure. That is to say that the individual suffers and without an explanation feels his

554
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,280
suffering to be meaningless. It's part of the unknown, right? The discomfort of the unknown is

555
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,160
a thousand times more painful than the suffering itself, the sense that one's enduring a kind

556
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:14,880
of meaningless suffering. The priest gives the parishioner suffering meaning, that is his great

557
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,000
benefaction to mankind in a way, that he can make their suffering meaningful, and thus eases the

558
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,160
pain of suffering by attributing it to a cause. Now the entire mechanism of this, in Nietzsche's

559
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,520
view, is very bad because it multiplies the suffering in order to deal with the suffering.

560
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,560
But that's neither here nor there for our purposes in analyzing this passage. The key point

561
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,240
is that by giving the suffering meaning, the priest is engaging in this thinking based on

562
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:46,160
imaginary causes, and that it's better to have this imaginary cause than no cause at all.

563
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,600
Nietzsche finds that this prejudice is right there in the work of, for example, Schopenhauer,

564
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:58,400
his once great influence whom he later rejected. Nietzsche quotes world as well in representation,

565
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:05,360
quote, every great pain, whether physical or spiritual, declares what we deserve, for it could

566
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:12,560
not come to us if we did not deserve it, end quote. Nietzsche criticized this aspect of Schopenhauer's

567
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,200
thinking, once again in human all to human, where he said that we tend to think that because a

568
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:23,440
sensation exists, there must be some justification for it. The word deserve in Schopenhauer

569
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,840
is really an attempt to legitimize or justify suffering. Why? Well, in order to give it that

570
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,720
much needed meaning. What does it mean for suffering to be deserved? Well, it means there

571
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,360
was some way that it could have been prevented, some way of acting or being that we did not

572
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:45,440
properly fulfill. And as a result, we must suffer. And Nietzsche argues that reveals the truth of

573
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:53,040
morality as a poisoner and slanderer of life that it is. Morality always has this idea behind it,

574
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:59,280
of treating the suffering of life as a punishment for wrong action. Meanwhile, good feelings,

575
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,800
good conscience, happiness, that's all conceived as the reward for the consciousness having done

576
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:11,760
good deeds, of having acted the proper way. You used your will to obey the laws of God and so on.

577
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,320
And so good feelings are the reward for right action, bad feelings are the punishment for wrong

578
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:24,480
action. You know, again, the pleasure in these ideas is in giving a meaning to the entire human

579
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:31,040
psychodrama of feelings and sensations. Nietzsche raises an issue with this as well, though. He

580
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:37,360
writes that the so-called good conscience is, quote, a physiological state, which at times

581
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:43,520
looks so much like good digestion that it is hard to tell them apart, end quote. In other words,

582
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:48,560
the reason you're in a good mood is probably because you had a good wholesome meal and no indigestion

583
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:54,400
while metabolizing it. You say the cause of your happiness is your virtuous deeds. Nietzsche says

584
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:00,960
the cause of your happiness is your gut. He also takes issue with what he calls a naïve fallacy,

585
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,120
that happiness comes from the successful completion of some enterprise. That in other words, you

586
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:13,680
know, we reach a goal that we've we've long tried to attain. You complete some meaningful task or

587
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,800
project and that's what makes you happy. Nietzsche says, quote, the successful termination of some

588
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:25,280
enterprise does not by any means give a hypochondriac or a Pascal agreeable feelings, end quote.

589
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:34,320
So to use the example of Blaise Pascal, it seems quite probable to me that Pascal was never happy

590
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:41,520
or rarely if ever happy might be a more measured way for me to put it. Pascal was an extreme depressive.

591
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,000
You know, he writes extensively about just how horrible it would be if it turned out that the

592
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,760
only existence were this world, you know, this world of impermanence and suffering, right? That

593
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:57,680
the human condition is like being one of many chained prisoners simply awaiting our execution.

594
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,600
That we're like a mode of dust in a chaotic universe whose scale is just beyond any comprehension.

595
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:08,720
These kinds of terrifying existential thoughts are always sort of storming through Pascal's mind

596
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:15,440
and they don't go away when he completes some task or personal challenge. They don't go away when he

597
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,280
you know, achieves his salvation of his soul through Christianity. So he believes, right?

598
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:28,800
If anything, these feelings are heightened now when Pascal becomes a Christian because he begins

599
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:34,880
to fear for his own salvation and he writes that salvation is uncertain even for the martyrs

600
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:41,200
up until the time when you face, you know, the justice of God or so on and so forth, whether

601
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,320
or not you find out that God will extend his grace to you. We might say the example of the

602
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:52,160
hypochondriac is also instructive here, you know, types with sustained high anxiety.

603
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:59,200
The actual circumstances of their lives don't matter that much in terms of regulating the state.

604
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,760
You know, their brains just always invent some reason why they need to be freaking out because

605
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,480
there's always at least some possibility that you ought to be freaking out. You know, there's always

606
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:14,160
could be some medical reason lurking within your physiology that you haven't become aware of yet.

607
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,720
You can always come up with something if your brain is dead set on worrying.

608
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,880
And so again, attributing the cause of your worrying to some definite event or external force

609
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,880
is an imaginary cause. And that becomes very obvious with such terminally anxious people

610
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,440
that they simply have something wrong, something that's malfunctioning with their brain that's

611
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,040
making them anxious. And then in fact, the searching for the imaginary causes of their anxiety is

612
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:46,960
actually part of the anxiety. It's actually part of that anxious brain cycle. You know,

613
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:53,120
similarly to with depression, depressed people aren't sad all the time, because every single

614
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:59,840
day of their lives is a never ending tragedy of just horrible calamitous things. It's because

615
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,400
they're incapable of being happy. That doesn't mean that that situation can't change by the way.

616
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,760
I'm not saying you're doomed to depression forever. That's not what I'm saying at all by the way.

617
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,000
I'm not saying there isn't a solution for their depression. It just means that blaming

618
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:19,120
external circumstances for a repeated sustained feeling that's happening inside of your head.

619
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,600
That is rather obviously a mistake. And it's actually part of that whole pathology is to

620
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:33,040
make those projections. Nietzsche writes, quote, in truth, all these supposed explanations are

621
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:38,720
resultant states. And as it were, translations of pleasurable or unpleasurable feelings into a

622
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:45,040
false dialect. One is in a state of hope because the basic physiological feeling is once again

623
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:51,200
strong and rich. One trusts in God because the feeling of fullness and strength gives a sense

624
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:58,480
of rest. Morality and religion belong altogether to the psychology of error. In every single case,

625
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,280
cause and effect are confused. Or truth is confused with the effects of believing something to be

626
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:11,920
true. Or a state of consciousness is confused with its causes. End quote. And so at this point,

627
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:19,280
we arrive at the final great error. Free will. In many ways, free will exemplifies all of these

628
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,480
errors and thought that we've previously considered. But Nietzsche lists it as a special case. And I

629
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:30,880
think because from free will, we can infer what it is that sets this entire erroneous thought

630
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,800
process into motion. The germ of the idea of free will Nietzsche alleges comes from what he calls

631
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,640
the foulest of all the theologians, artifices. So the worst thing that the religious thinkers

632
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:49,360
have ever created. This is the notion of responsibility, which makes the subject dependent

633
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:55,440
on the religious caste. This is because responsibility is what sits at the foundations of

634
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,800
all morality. This is what we have been articulating throughout this examination when it comes to

635
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:06,080
the tendencies of all moralities and religions to promise happiness in exchange for quote unquote

636
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:13,120
good behavior, and to promise punishment as the wages of sin. Responsibility is the concept required

637
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,560
for all moralism, without which the moral interpretation of human life just simply falls

638
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:24,720
apart. And why do we consider human beings responsible? Why are we responsible for our

639
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:32,480
actions or for our will? This is because of the belief in the doctrine of free will free will

640
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,520
responsibility. These concepts are more or less the same thing. We might ask a simple question

641
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:44,560
therefore. Why seek responsibility? Why would we create such a concept assuming that it is

642
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:52,560
false as Nietzsche says? Why would we have this notion then quote, wherever responsibilities are

643
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:58,800
sought? It is usually the instinct of wanting to judge and punish, which is at work. Becoming has

644
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:05,200
been deprived of its innocence when any being such and such is traced back to will to purposes,

645
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:11,600
to acts of responsibility. The doctrine of the will has been invented essentially for the purpose

646
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:18,560
of punishment. That is because one wanted to impute guilt. The entire old psychology, the psychology

647
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:24,240
of will, was conditioned by the fact that its originators, the priests at the head of ancient

648
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,680
communities, wanted to create for themselves the right to punish, or wanted to create this right

649
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:36,720
for God. Men were considered free so that they might be judged and punished, so that they might

650
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:43,440
become guilty. Consequently, every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every

651
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:50,320
act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness end quote. So this passage is

652
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:55,760
important in light of the fact that Nietzsche has attempted to make sense of human life with what he

653
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:02,480
calls an economy of principles. That is to say the greatest possible explanatory power excuse me

654
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,520
in the fewest possible principles. If human life is to be understood naturalistically then where

655
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,680
do we get the notion of free will? Here as elsewhere Nietzsche says the answer is will to power.

656
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:21,040
The priestly class, the ascetic types, they create free will, they create moral responsibility

657
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,840
because it's a means of wielding power. It makes the individuals of the community responsible,

658
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,560
and not just responsible in some sort of abstract sense, responsible to the priest,

659
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,960
who is the intercessor between man and God. If man thinks that there is right action and wrong

660
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,120
action, and that he's morally responsible for choosing right action over wrong,

661
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,200
he will naturally ask the priest, how should I act? And if he's asked, uh,

662
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,520
actioned wrongly in the past, he'll go to the priest and ask to be absolved.

663
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:00,640
The priest attained power over the flock by making them guilty. As Nietzsche writes further down in

664
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:08,560
the passage, quote, Christianity is a metaphysics of the hangman end quote. That is the aim of this

665
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,720
doctrine of responsibility, which is substantially identical with the doctrine of free will. And

666
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:20,160
Nietzsche writes that the priests and theologians continue to infect becoming, which is nature in

667
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,760
its pure innocence, with this guilt, that this is in some sense the ugliest thing that the human

668
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:32,320
animal does, and that the human animal does uniquely. It introduces guilt into innocent nature, innocent

669
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:39,920
becoming. To Nietzsche, therefore, free will is not simply a doctrine that expresses a common

670
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:47,280
sense truth about the world. It was a weed that was planted in us all for a very specific purpose.

671
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:54,080
And perhaps all such ideas, all such beliefs are planted for a similar such purpose to motivate

672
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,600
a certain kind of behavior, to express the power of a given drive within mankind.

673
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,680
This doctrine of responsibility, if we examine it in light of a naturalistic understanding of the

674
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:10,320
world, is a strange and unique thing. It doesn't really fit with the rest of our comprehension

675
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:16,480
of nature, where we never perceive, we never look for responsibility. We don't see responsibility

676
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,160
in the cosmos and the orbiting bodies slamming into one another or flying off into the abysses of

677
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:28,480
space. The one place that we find it is in ourselves, due to what we call these inner facts,

678
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:35,600
actually, conscience, or an intuition that has been inculcated in us and nurtured.

679
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,440
If we examine the doctrine strictly on a logical basis, we find it's premised on great

680
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:47,760
leaps of logical supposition, which designate the will as a causal force, the ego as the cause of

681
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:55,840
the will, and the ego one's self-nature as an uncaused cause, for which one becomes responsible

682
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:03,200
for themselves, that is, as if one had created himself and decided his own nature. This is a

683
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,160
series of fallacious assumptions, which we're not at all permitted to make according to the facts

684
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:14,400
at hand. It's nothing but an interpretation based on the attribution of imaginary causes,

685
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,040
taking something that merely accompanies the event as the cause of the event,

686
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:25,200
and nature, as he says, is an immoralist who's trying with all his strength to, quote,

687
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,880
take the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment out of the world again,

688
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:38,000
and to cleanse psychology, history, nature, and social institutions, end quote.

689
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,840
As this is his goal, he must necessarily oppose himself to the doctrine of free will,

690
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,600
which is the origin of that stain on the self-consciousness of nature, which is

691
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:57,840
man. The last section of this chapter, the four great errors, section eight, we can regard as

692
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,760
Nietzsche's mission statement, so to speak. If all of these apparently self-evident beliefs are

693
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:09,760
in fact errors, then what doctrine ought we take up instead? And he directly contrasts himself

694
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,520
with the positions of Kant and Schopenhauer, who both question free will on a strictly logical basis,

695
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,800
but appeal to two things, our intuition of free will, i.e., the way we think about ourselves

696
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:28,480
and think about our actions, regardless of the truth of those thoughts, and also to the notion

697
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:34,800
of intelligible freedom, that in spite of the fact that we act in one way or another

698
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,120
in accord with our own nature, meaning that apparently we simply are one way or another,

699
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,840
man must have had a freedom to be this or that kind of person. There must be some kind of choice

700
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,840
prior to the realization of one's nature. And Nietzsche implies that this is because we've

701
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,800
always held a more basic and blatantly false prejudice, but one which nevertheless colors

702
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:05,040
our thinking, that man is the effect of some special purpose or some special destiny.

703
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,840
This kind of thinking is right in line with our entire concept of being,

704
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,880
which draws these lines of separation between subject and object, between cause and effect,

705
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,880
between one phenomena and another. That man is divided from the rest of nature as a special

706
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:27,040
quote-unquote thing, a special case, something capable of attaining the ideal of humanity,

707
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:32,160
the ideal of happiness, the ideal of morality. But Nietzsche argues, quote,

708
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:39,680
the fatality of his essence is not to be disentangled from the fatality of all that has been and will

709
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:47,200
be, end quote. The counter doctrine then to free will and to the entire doctrine of causality,

710
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:54,880
which includes even the refutation of free will, the doctrine of determinism, all of this is to be

711
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:01,360
dismissed in the face of Nietzsche's new doctrine of fate. This is why I tend to call Nietzsche's view

712
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:08,720
fatalism, in which all apparently separate things and events are part of a vast tapestry. And this

713
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:14,480
isn't like a mechanistic series of billiard balls clacking into one after the other in a chain of

714
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:20,080
causes and effects that must either end in the absurdity of an infinite regress or the equal

715
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:26,320
absurdity of an uncaused cause. We might say, by the way, the infinite regress absurdity is found

716
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:32,160
in determinism, and the uncaused cause absurdity is found in the libertarian free will doctrine.

717
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,640
That is what the debate is between. No, Nietzsche is not having any of this, because to even create

718
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:46,000
that image of existence as a chain, a series of links, is to draw arbitrary divisions to,

719
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,200
from our human perspective, which informs us not one bit about the nature of human independent

720
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:56,400
reality, create all of these separate categories and then call them beings or existence or causes

721
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,640
and effects. And in this way, Nietzsche rebukes Kant while retaining his influence from the neocontians,

722
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,640
which is with Nietzsche all the way from the beginning of his career. He carries forward

723
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:13,280
that intuition that causality is not something, quote unquote, out there in an objective world.

724
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:21,920
It's something which happens at the intersection of human perception and the so-called external

725
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:27,120
world, something that is useful for us as an interpretive framework, even though it may be

726
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:32,800
a false framework for all that. We'll now look at the final paragraph of the chapter,

727
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:40,400
the conclusion of the four great errors, quote. One is necessary. One is a piece of faithfulness.

728
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,880
One belongs to the whole. One is in the whole. There is nothing which could judge, measure,

729
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,520
compare, or sentence our being, for that would mean judging, measuring, comparing,

730
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:57,440
or sentencing the whole. But there is nothing besides the whole, that nobody is held responsible

731
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:02,720
any longer, that the mode of being may not be traced back to a cause of prima, that the world

732
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:09,600
does not form a unity either as a sensorium or as a spirit. That alone is the great liberation.

733
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:16,400
With this alone is the innocence of becoming restored. The concept of God was until now the

734
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:24,000
greatest objection to existence. We deny God. We deny the responsibility in God. Only thereby do

735
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:32,000
we redeem the world, end quote. To want one aspect of fate to be different is to want the whole

736
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,880
thing to be different. The entire interplay of forces would be altered by one force disappearing,

737
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,880
changing its course or intensity. And yet reality is not to be conceived as a unity,

738
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:48,080
as a monism, and the way that, say, many of the early pre-platonics thought that reality could

739
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:54,240
be conceived. No, Nietzsche is with the pluralists, and he's with Heraclitus. The one is the many.

740
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,400
The many is not reducible to a one, but neither is any part of the many to be conceived as a

741
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:07,520
cause unto itself divided ontologically from the rest of the many. The many remains a many,

742
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:13,120
not the subject divided from the world of objects. Nietzsche's fatalism therefore

743
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:20,240
dares us to accept a pluralistic reality, and every event within it, as absolutely necessitated

744
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:26,240
by a non-purposive relation of forces. If we take that great leap of acceptance,

745
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:33,040
of regarding every piece of fate as necessary, we affirm the entirety of the great play of

746
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:39,360
becoming. And if one does this, then imputing guilt or responsibilities to some portion of it

747
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:44,800
would be just another absurdity. Because every other part which we affirm and call good can only

748
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,240
exist in relation to those parts that we call bad. That we are to say, along with Spinoza,

749
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:57,520
that the many modifications of existence, the various phenomena, meaning animals, trees, mountains,

750
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:05,520
lightning, flash floods, human beings, warfare, disease, weather patterns, all of it, can only

751
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:12,720
be regarded as good or bad from the standpoint of our limited human reason, from the standpoint of

752
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:19,120
one particular perspective. None of it is good or bad in and of itself. Because to say that would

753
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:25,280
be to deny the whole the right of existence. In Nietzsche's eyes, this is the effect of the

754
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:31,680
God doctrine, the idea of an eternal moral judge presiding over all being. Being instantiated in

755
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:37,920
our thought has an eternally existing form of consciousness, and in eternal moral law, which

756
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:44,240
intercedes in existence, judges and condemns some, affirms and uplifts others, divides all the souls

757
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:50,720
at the end of time into the good people and the bad people. This is not a healthy view of existence.

758
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:56,400
It's an argument against existence, in fact, because it necessitates, as it were, a judgment

759
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:02,640
passed against the world. If this world of nature and the people living in it, its states and empires,

760
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:08,880
are to be judged from the absolute moral standard of Christianity, then the world must be deemed guilty.

761
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:16,400
But we already know where this drive to call the world guilty comes from. Nietzsche suggests

762
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,080
that this is where we should look to determine why it is that we would make such errors as those that

763
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:28,960
we have considered. Once again, under our apparently cool-headed rationalist view of the world,

764
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:36,320
we find what is ultimately religious. And that is true, even of those of us

765
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:44,240
who have formally left religion. These great errors still remain in our thought.

766
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:52,080
That's all for this week, everyone. Thanks for joining me. I'm back at home from after being on

767
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:57,760
tour. I was sick for a while. I don't know if you can hear it in my voice, maybe it gives my voice

768
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:04,240
a little more roughness or grit, but I'm getting better. I'm improving. As many of you know,

769
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:08,160
if you've been listening for a while, you usually get sick when you're on tour like that.

770
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:15,040
But we've got four more episodes of this season coming out. I'm excited for every one of these.

771
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:19,600
I think these are going to be really good. I'm happy with them regardless of what the

772
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:25,280
reception is going to be, but I think it's going to be pretty good. Alright, that's all. Signing off.
