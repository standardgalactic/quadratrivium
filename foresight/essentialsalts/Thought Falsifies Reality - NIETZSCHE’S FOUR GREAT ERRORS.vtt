00:00.720 --> 00:07.120
If I were to suggest a use for philosophy, I would argue that perhaps its best use is as a tool

00:07.840 --> 00:16.640
for uprooting weeds. Let's assume for a moment that the psyche, the mind, is something like a patch

00:16.640 --> 00:22.000
of earth, and that within our minds we have all sorts of plants that are growing in there,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.640
and you know where the germs for these plants come from it may not always be obvious,

00:27.360 --> 00:32.560
much that's within the mind, remains deep beneath the soil, beneath the surface of our

00:32.560 --> 00:39.760
consciousness. All of us would like to imagine that, at the very least, we are competent gardeners

00:39.760 --> 00:45.200
of our own mental soil, and that only those beliefs and opinions and sentiments which we

00:45.200 --> 00:53.920
planted there, and that we nourish, only those are allowed to grow there. But the reality is,

00:53.920 --> 01:01.120
perhaps, unfortunately, that the ecosystem of the mind is not so consciously planned

01:01.120 --> 01:06.560
as we'd like to imagine it. All sorts of invasive species make their way into the psyche,

01:07.680 --> 01:13.680
and our minds are cross-pollinated, so to speak, with all the other garden plots around us,

01:13.680 --> 01:21.200
all those other individuals, and their beliefs and their opinions. Things were planted in us

01:21.200 --> 01:26.800
before we were born, or before we were old enough to have any understanding of what was being planted.

01:27.920 --> 01:33.600
In short, most of us walk around with the ideas of other people in our heads,

01:34.320 --> 01:38.320
and while this certainly doesn't mean that everything we receive from our culture

01:38.960 --> 01:46.320
and from our upbringing is negative, it does mean that it is a somewhat natural inclination

01:46.960 --> 01:54.400
for human beings to passively or even unconsciously accept any number of what we might call

01:54.400 --> 02:00.800
common-sense notions. Here in modernity, we are more or less comfortable with admitting

02:01.440 --> 02:09.040
that this sort of passive receipt of ideas occurs when it comes to, for example, moral judgments.

02:09.040 --> 02:15.200
It's easy enough to see how a social animal, such as a human being, would naturally mimic

02:15.200 --> 02:21.360
the moral beliefs of other human beings around them, to whatever degree, and whatever you think

02:21.360 --> 02:28.560
about morality, I would say most people are on board with that idea, but this doesn't stop with

02:28.560 --> 02:36.240
morality. Suppose there are prejudices with even deeper roots. Suppose these prejudices are not

02:36.880 --> 02:43.440
simply moral, or that they don't only concern themselves with human behavior and the social

02:43.440 --> 02:50.640
mores. Suppose that we have prejudices that constitute a kind of received wisdom as concerns

02:50.640 --> 02:57.600
the most basic facts of reality, that when it comes to not just how to act, but the nature

02:57.600 --> 03:03.280
of reality itself, we are operating based on a series of beliefs that we've simply passively

03:03.280 --> 03:11.520
accepted. Philosophy finds its use here. It's an activity in disabusing ourselves from believing

03:11.520 --> 03:18.240
in truths that we've received as common sense wisdom with no other justification beyond

03:18.240 --> 03:24.400
that simple fact. Philosophy, in some sense, begins when we start to take note of the ways

03:24.400 --> 03:30.000
in which even the most mundane assertions and statements of opinion contain within them

03:30.000 --> 03:36.800
metaphysical beliefs, and that these metaphysical beliefs have simply been allowed to grow within

03:36.800 --> 03:44.560
your garden without you even taking note of it. Now, suppose that among such received beliefs

03:44.560 --> 03:51.760
that you possess are included beliefs that are in fact errors. Mistakes, perhaps owing to an

03:51.760 --> 03:57.120
inherent flaw in human psychology, or whatever the case may be, and that nevertheless such a

03:57.120 --> 04:03.760
mistake has simply been allowed to propagate or even been called self-evident. This is what we

04:03.760 --> 04:10.640
would call a weed. We could in fact characterize the various great philosophers according to which

04:10.640 --> 04:17.200
weeds they set themselves the task of uprooting. So with Socrates, the unquestioned way of life

04:17.200 --> 04:24.240
of the Athenians set by religion and tradition, Descartes, the prejudice that the external world

04:24.240 --> 04:31.120
in our perception of it can simply be taken for granted. Rousseau, the faith that civilization

04:31.120 --> 04:38.480
has improved mankind. Hegel, that things are things in themselves, separable from the things to

04:38.480 --> 04:44.720
which they are related, and so on and so forth. We've defined all these philosophers by what

04:44.720 --> 04:50.160
they're attacking, right? In some sense, philosophy always begins within attack on a view that the

04:50.160 --> 04:56.080
philosopher has realized to be nothing more than an assumption, an unquestionable assumption,

04:56.080 --> 05:02.880
because it's assumed by so many. As we all know by now, Friedrich Nietzsche was a prodigious critic,

05:03.600 --> 05:10.000
and if we were to say that philosophy begins at this point of attack, you'd also have to say

05:10.960 --> 05:18.480
few philosophized as hard as Nietzsche did. He never declared peace. His critique of modern

05:18.480 --> 05:24.160
thought begins in his first book, and it continues through to the very end. His targets are numerous,

05:24.800 --> 05:29.760
among the assumptions that he attempted to weed out are, well, morality itself,

05:30.640 --> 05:34.640
or the notion of a true world, an intelligible world behind the senses,

05:35.680 --> 05:40.800
an intuition that begins in philosophy but becomes passively accepted through religion.

05:41.840 --> 05:48.400
Nietzsche also attempts to uproot nihilism or world weariness, sentiments that Nietzsche believed

05:48.400 --> 05:55.120
were suffused throughout modern culture. Already, these are sort of titanic, monstrous weeds that

05:55.120 --> 06:01.760
Nietzsche has decided to wrestle with. Today, we're going to take a look at one of those critical

06:01.760 --> 06:09.200
passages in Nietzsche, which is in Twilight of Idols. Many of the sections contained in Twilight

06:09.200 --> 06:16.160
of Idols are Nietzsche's attempts to summarize or condense ideas that he'd written about for

06:16.160 --> 06:22.240
over a decade by this point. This section is no different. It is called The Four Great Errors.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.720
I've discussed this section a long time ago on the podcast in the episode on free will,

06:28.720 --> 06:32.480
and I think it's been brought up in one or two other episodes over the years.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.600
But this passage is important enough on its own to warrant its own discussion.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.240
It was relevant to our discussion on free will because the Four Great Errors

06:43.040 --> 06:47.120
is the most significant passage for comprehending Nietzsche's view on that subject,

06:47.680 --> 06:53.680
above pretty much all other passages in Nietzsche's corpus. And in The Four Great Errors, he attacks

06:53.680 --> 07:00.480
free will, but without falling into the determinist camp. The reason he doesn't fall into that

07:00.480 --> 07:05.920
camp is because the criticism in The Four Great Errors is targeted at our whole mental framework

07:05.920 --> 07:11.360
of cause and effect, or rather the way in which cause and effect are applied in our thought.

07:12.400 --> 07:18.480
Nietzsche can't be a determinist because he's not even convinced that our will is bound within

07:18.480 --> 07:25.280
an infinite net of causes. That would be the normal determinist critique of the libertarian

07:25.280 --> 07:32.000
free will doctrine, but it would still fundamentally be the same error. And while Nietzsche doesn't

07:32.000 --> 07:38.880
quite come up to the point of denying causality altogether, he calls into question all of the

07:38.960 --> 07:43.760
commonplace habits in our thinking about causality, that color the way that we make

07:43.760 --> 07:49.840
sense of reality, that what we designate as a cause and what we designate as effect

07:50.560 --> 07:56.560
is often an arbitrary distinction. Usually the reason for distinguishing the cause from the effect

07:57.120 --> 08:03.760
accords with some kind of psychological need or inclination, rather than what might be a sober

08:03.760 --> 08:10.640
understanding of reality. Furthermore, we often reason backward to determine the so-called cause

08:10.640 --> 08:16.720
of a given event. The mind will invent causes where one is not immediately perceptible.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.960
Free will is merely one of the erroneous thought processes that Nietzsche draws our

08:22.960 --> 08:29.680
attention to in this passage. But in fact, this type of error goes all the way down to our very

08:29.680 --> 08:38.240
conception of being, of a reality full of quote unquote things that are consistent, unitary,

08:38.240 --> 08:45.040
coherent. In other words, existence or beings. Again, one of those apparently self-evident

08:45.040 --> 08:50.480
truths contained within that word being, that nevertheless has metaphysical implications

08:50.480 --> 08:56.880
about reality itself, and that we nevertheless all use on a daily basis because it's baked into

08:56.960 --> 09:03.200
the structure of our language. So first, I'll list off these four errors, and then we'll get

09:03.200 --> 09:08.080
into the nuts and bolts of the passage in which Nietzsche explains what he means by each and gives

09:08.080 --> 09:17.680
examples. The errors are as follows. One, the error of confusing cause and effect. This is quite

09:17.680 --> 09:25.840
straightforward. We believe something is a cause when actually it's an effect. Two, the error of

09:25.840 --> 09:33.040
false causality. That is, we believe something is in a causal relationship when in fact it only

09:33.040 --> 09:39.760
accompanies the so-called effect, and that we've not actually established a causal relationship.

09:41.200 --> 09:48.720
Three, the error of imaginary causes. We invent causes based on a sensation or a mental state,

09:49.360 --> 09:55.440
and Nietzsche says that this is in order to justify that mental state. And finally,

09:55.440 --> 10:01.840
four, the error of free will. A specific example of such an error in our causal thinking.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.280
And on closer inspection, the error of free will points to a more profound error,

10:08.080 --> 10:14.080
that we establish such cause and effect relationships such as the ego causing one's actions

10:14.960 --> 10:21.360
because of a psychological necessity, the perceived consequences of believing in this

10:21.360 --> 10:27.440
causal relationship, the consequences of holding the belief, or the consequences of not holding the

10:27.440 --> 10:34.880
belief. That's what actually motivates the belief itself, or perceived or imagined consequences

10:35.840 --> 10:40.080
of if we hold the belief what happens, if we don't hold the belief what happens,

10:40.080 --> 10:46.000
what are the consequences for humanity. So, confusing cause and effect, false causality,

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
imaginary causes, and then freedom of the will. With that introduction, let's look to the passage.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.520
The beginning of the four great errors concerns the error of confusing cause and effect,

10:57.520 --> 11:04.160
and Nietzsche explains this error through the example of Alvice Cornaro. So, Cornaro is a writer

11:04.240 --> 11:11.120
and an architect during the Italian Renaissance period. He's born in the 15th century in Padua,

11:11.120 --> 11:16.720
although the exact date of his birth is disputed, and I bring this up because it's disputed for

11:16.720 --> 11:22.880
an interesting reason which we'll discuss in a moment, but Cornaro is born sometime between the

11:22.880 --> 11:32.000
1460s and the 1480s, and he lived until 1566. Although he's related to a noble family from

11:32.000 --> 11:39.760
Venice, Cornaro is merely the son of an innkeeper. He would sort of draw upon that relation to

11:39.760 --> 11:45.680
nobility because of the prestige of it, but in fact, he's from a lesser branch of the family,

11:45.680 --> 11:52.560
but he's able to take what little money his family had and became a rather successful entrepreneur.

11:54.160 --> 11:58.160
He's a somewhat interesting character, actually. He had little scientific training.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.920
He attended university in Venice, but he dropped out because he felt that the education he received

12:03.920 --> 12:11.120
was overly philosophical. It was disconnected from practical knowledge, which tells us something

12:11.120 --> 12:17.760
about him right there. He made his fortune by obtaining permission to attempt to reclaim land

12:18.320 --> 12:25.440
from the lagoon near Venice on the Adriatic Sea. So, what Cornaro does is he successfully applied

12:25.520 --> 12:33.840
the science of hydraulics to turn this portion of the lagoon into wheat fields and fishing ponds.

12:34.560 --> 12:40.240
This is good for Cornaro as a business venture, and it's good for the city because the lagoon,

12:40.240 --> 12:46.560
it causes swarms of insects in the summertime and winter fogs. It smells terrible. There's just

12:46.560 --> 12:51.520
all sorts of problems. It's much better to have wheat fields and fishing ponds next to your city

12:51.520 --> 13:01.840
than a stinky, hazardous lagoon. So, after this, Cornaro publishes a treatise on water management,

13:02.480 --> 13:06.800
and he would go on to become a patron of the arts with the wealth that he made from

13:07.520 --> 13:12.880
ventures like this, and he is credited with introducing the Roman Renaissance style of

13:12.880 --> 13:18.400
architecture into Northern Italy. None of this is why Cornaro is of interest to Nietzsche,

13:18.400 --> 13:25.040
by the way. Nietzsche's fascination with the example of Cornaro is due to a series of treatises

13:25.040 --> 13:31.680
that he published later in his life. Cornaro is known as a humanist to this very day because he

13:31.680 --> 13:37.760
attacked a prejudice that was common in medieval European society and had lingered. It was popular

13:37.760 --> 13:44.480
up to his own time, and this is the view that old age is nothing but a period of pain and decay.

13:45.440 --> 13:50.880
You know, this is the harsh winter of life. The years that you spend as an elderly person

13:50.880 --> 13:58.000
are not but suffering, and that this is in some way simply the natural order of human life. That

13:58.000 --> 14:04.640
you should expect this and endure it stoically, but just know that when you get to old age,

14:04.640 --> 14:09.760
it's going to be a bad time. You know, you can rejoice because your body is about to be

14:09.760 --> 14:15.040
rejuvenated in heaven, but it's more or less accepted that one's physical existence at the

14:15.040 --> 14:22.960
end of their natural life is, well, bad. Cornaro lives to a very old age, and he says on the contrary,

14:23.680 --> 14:30.000
one's elderly years are the most beautiful period of life. He says that God wills all of us to live

14:30.000 --> 14:38.560
long and healthy lives, and to live to reach this best age of one's lifetime, because in old age,

14:38.560 --> 14:45.760
all of your accumulated wisdom allows you to see the world with new eyes or with just a better,

14:45.760 --> 14:52.080
higher perspective than the youth have on life. And so, Cornaro becomes a kind of health and

14:52.080 --> 14:59.920
longevity advocate, and he lives to either his 90s or to be over 100 years old, his exact age

14:59.920 --> 15:05.600
when he dies is disputed because we have various birth dates for him, with some sources saying he

15:05.600 --> 15:16.400
was born in 1464, although it seems more likely he was born in the 1480s. That's just my belief

15:16.400 --> 15:22.720
that as Cornaro becomes a sort of guru on longevity, people begin to overestimate his age. It becomes

15:22.720 --> 15:28.400
exaggerated just how old this man lived to be. That's not an unusual phenomenon at all. It's

15:28.480 --> 15:36.640
very common among, for example, Taoist sages or Zen masters in the East. In any case, he did live to

15:36.640 --> 15:41.680
a very old age for somebody living in the 15th century, and so we finally come to the main point

15:41.680 --> 15:47.840
on which Nietzsche will use Cornaro in order to demonstrate a great error in thinking. Cornaro

15:47.840 --> 15:52.880
began to suffer from gastrointestinal problems and feverishness when he was around 35 years old.

15:53.680 --> 15:59.360
His doctors advised him to eat a very sparse diet, and Cornaro restricted himself to 12 ounces of

15:59.360 --> 16:10.000
food a day. Bread, egg yolk, meat, and soup, and 14 ounces of wine every day. So when he was in his

16:10.000 --> 16:15.040
80s, he was asked to write a treatise on his secret to longevity, and Cornaro attributed his

16:15.040 --> 16:24.320
good health to this diet. And Cornaro genuinely believed that liberality in one's diet, gluttonous

16:24.320 --> 16:30.800
consumption of food and drink, he says this is contrary to the will of God, and this is evidenced

16:30.800 --> 16:38.480
by the fact that it shortens your life. By living virtuously, by consuming only the caloric intake

16:38.480 --> 16:45.680
that you absolutely need, one earns a long life. And it's worth noting, aside from this religious

16:45.680 --> 16:52.880
or moral dimension of Cornaro's thought, this popular wisdom of caloric reduction

16:53.760 --> 16:59.280
would remain in the zeitgeist for hundreds of years afterwards. This was true up through Nietzsche's

16:59.680 --> 17:08.560
time. The popular wisdom that Nietzsche calls coronarism is not really overturned until the 20th

17:08.560 --> 17:16.240
century. And so now the passage Nietzsche writes, quote, everyone knows the book of the famous Cornaro

17:16.240 --> 17:22.880
in which he recommends his slender diet as a recipe for a long and happy life, a virtuous one too.

17:23.840 --> 17:28.880
Few books have been read so much, even now thousands of copies are sold in England every year.

17:29.760 --> 17:36.560
I do not doubt that scarcely any book, except the Bible as is made, has done as much harm,

17:36.560 --> 17:44.560
has shortened as many lives as this well-intentioned curiosity. The reason? The mistaking of the

17:44.560 --> 17:51.360
effect for the cause. The worthy Italian thought his diet was the cause of his long life, whereas the

17:51.440 --> 17:57.760
precondition for a long life, the extraordinary slowness of his metabolism, the consumption of

17:57.760 --> 18:05.760
so little was the cause of his slender diet. He was not free to eat little or much. His frugality

18:05.760 --> 18:13.200
was not a matter of, quote, unquote, free will. He became sick when he ate more. But whoever is

18:13.200 --> 18:19.920
no carp not only does well to eat properly, but needs to, a scholar in our own time with his

18:19.920 --> 18:25.200
rapid consumption of nervous energy, would simply destroy himself with Cornaro's diet,

18:25.920 --> 18:34.560
crede experto, end quote. That last line means, believe him who has tried, credit the expert.

18:35.120 --> 18:41.120
So implicitly, Nietzsche is tying himself to the type of the nervous modern scholarly type.

18:41.120 --> 18:47.120
At least he was at one time during his professor days. So again, who says that Nietzsche can't

18:47.120 --> 18:53.440
take a shot at himself every once in a while. In any case, as we've discussed many times on the

18:53.440 --> 18:59.200
podcast, Nietzsche spent quite a lot of time experimenting with his own diet. He believed

18:59.200 --> 19:05.600
there was a very real link between your overall physical and mental health. And that one's daily

19:05.600 --> 19:11.360
habits, your daily intake of food, you shouldn't simply go about these things thoughtlessly.

19:12.320 --> 19:16.240
The question of Nietzsche's own diet and his views on diet are somewhat fascinating,

19:16.240 --> 19:21.040
but the key point to understand about this is that Nietzsche has come to understand something

19:21.040 --> 19:27.840
that I think most nutritionists today would agree with. There is no universal diet. Now,

19:27.840 --> 19:33.520
this doesn't mean there's no definite claim that we can make about what is healthy and unhealthy

19:33.520 --> 19:39.440
in general. But different people have different physiological needs, different lifestyles,

19:40.320 --> 19:44.320
just different restrictions on what they can or should eat for their best health.

19:44.320 --> 19:49.280
And Nietzsche learns that through first hand experience. He also sees that the eating habits

19:49.280 --> 19:55.040
of European countries differ dramatically, such as when he compares the eating habits of Germans

19:55.040 --> 20:00.880
to that of the Italians and so on. As a result, he's able to see that Coronaro's diet can't be a

20:00.880 --> 20:07.760
panacea, that in fact, it was right for Coronaro, but that it would not be right for many others.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.800
And if this is the case, this means that Coronaro's diet may have shortened a few lives

20:12.800 --> 20:19.440
rather than lengthened them, that people with a higher caloric need might have fallen victim to

20:19.440 --> 20:24.800
thinking that, you know, Coronaro's diet is the cause of his longevity. As I noted earlier,

20:24.800 --> 20:31.040
this isn't a critique of cause and effect as such. In fact, Nietzsche says that Coronaro's

20:31.040 --> 20:36.640
longevity is the cause of his diet. If you pay attention, that's actually a very funny claim,

20:36.640 --> 20:44.160
but he makes it quite clear a slow metabolism is the cause of a long life. This kind of thinking

20:44.160 --> 20:48.720
in Nietzsche, by the way, goes all the way back to his lectures in the pre-plotonics,

20:48.720 --> 20:53.440
where he references the thought experiment by the philosopher of science, von Baer,

20:54.240 --> 21:00.000
in which it is imagined that pulse rate correlates with one's experience of the passage of time.

21:00.880 --> 21:04.880
That is one hypothesis that as far as I understand has not been borne out in terms of

21:04.880 --> 21:11.280
modern scientific knowledge, as Nietzsche's insights on nutrition perhaps have. But that said,

21:11.280 --> 21:17.600
this colors Nietzsche's thinking, there's a speed to one's physiological existence, that we can

21:17.600 --> 21:23.760
measure the existence of a phenomena, in some sense, by the tempo at which it manifests.

21:24.960 --> 21:31.920
But if Coronaro's metabolism is what causes his long life, his slow rate of metabolizing

21:31.920 --> 21:40.000
sort of equates to a slow and long-lived existence, then that means that his physiology,

21:40.000 --> 21:47.680
what he is, is what accounts for his dietary needs. And in spite of all the unanswered questions that

21:47.680 --> 21:54.800
still remain concerning diet even to this day, it seems quite clear that on an epistemological level,

21:55.360 --> 22:00.960
the causal relationship has not been established here. That if we are to admit that once diet

22:00.960 --> 22:06.160
depends on their physiology, then is their physiology not the cause of their optimal diet

22:06.160 --> 22:11.200
rather than the optimal diet, the cause of the state of their physiology? We could of course say

22:11.200 --> 22:16.640
that living at variance with your optimal diet could be the cause of an early death, or living

22:16.640 --> 22:22.080
in accord with your optimal diet is the cause of a long life. But in that case, couldn't we just

22:22.080 --> 22:28.160
take the argument a step further? Why can't this person eat only according to their ideal diet?

22:29.040 --> 22:35.280
Maybe somebody really needs to have just red meat and potatoes and vegetables,

22:36.640 --> 22:41.920
why is it that they're always eating junk food? Well, maybe they have no impulse control. So why

22:41.920 --> 22:46.640
do they not have good impulse control? Isn't there a physiological reason for that too?

22:47.600 --> 22:55.120
Something about just their nature that makes them crave junk food and so on and so on, right?

22:55.120 --> 23:02.480
It's very hard to draw the line at a certain point and say, this is the final cause. That's one of

23:02.480 --> 23:07.680
the things that's sort of implicit behind this critique of our causal thinking is that in some

23:07.680 --> 23:12.000
sense, it's always arbitrary where we say, no, this is the cause. Somebody can always come along

23:12.000 --> 23:17.360
and say, okay, but what's the cause of that? And this answer doesn't satisfy us with our common

23:17.360 --> 23:22.640
sense wisdom, right? Why is it not satisfying? It's because we've been taught a certain mental

23:22.640 --> 23:28.240
framework throughout our whole lives that tells us exactly the opposite. And Nietzsche says that

23:28.240 --> 23:35.840
this radical idea here is pointing to this very error is the first example of his revaluation

23:35.840 --> 23:42.480
of all values. He writes that quote, the most general formula on which every religion and

23:42.480 --> 23:50.640
morality is founded, quote, do this and that, refrain from this and that, then you will be happy.

23:51.600 --> 24:00.160
Otherwise, end quote. That's what Nietzsche calls the original sin of reason in this passage in

24:00.160 --> 24:05.440
Twilight of Idols. But I should note here that this tendency and thought was observed by Nietzsche

24:05.440 --> 24:10.480
as early as human all to human. It's what he characterized there as one of the most common

24:10.480 --> 24:16.080
false conclusions arrived at by human reason. For the sake of comparison with the four great

24:16.080 --> 24:22.640
errors, let's look at section 227 of human all to human, where Nietzsche writes quote, Christianity,

24:22.640 --> 24:28.160
which was very innocent in its intellectual ideas, demanded faith and nothing but faith,

24:28.160 --> 24:34.160
and passionately rejected the desire for reasons. It pointed to the successful result of faith.

24:34.960 --> 24:39.840
You'll soon discover the advantage of faith is suggested. You'll be blessed because of it.

24:40.720 --> 24:46.160
The state, in fact, does the same thing, and each father raises his son in the same way.

24:46.880 --> 24:51.280
Just take this to be true, he says. You'll discover how good it feels.

24:52.400 --> 24:57.760
But this means that the truth of an opinion should be proved by its personal benefit.

24:58.560 --> 25:02.640
The usefulness of a teaching should guarantee its intellectual certainty

25:02.640 --> 25:07.120
and substantiation. This is as if the defendant were to say in court,

25:07.680 --> 25:13.600
my defender is telling the whole truth for just see what happens as a result of his plea. I am

25:13.600 --> 25:23.440
acquitted. End quote. So Nietzsche's point here, and human all to human, is that the proof for a

25:23.440 --> 25:29.440
given proposition in this formula is the happiness that the proposition creates. Do this and you

25:29.440 --> 25:35.120
will be happy. Believe this, you will discover how good it feels. The church called this the proof by

25:35.120 --> 25:40.400
pleasure. Nietzsche's point in human all to human is much more straightforward than it is in the

25:40.400 --> 25:45.440
Four Great Errors passage in Twilight of Idols. In human all to human Nietzsche is simply exposing

25:45.440 --> 25:52.560
the fact that this is a paralogism, a false syllogism that does not serve as proof of anything.

25:53.280 --> 25:58.160
Nietzsche's point here is simply this reasoning is false. It's incredibly common,

25:58.880 --> 26:05.120
but nonetheless it's false. Another example of human fallibility and reasoning often covered over

26:05.120 --> 26:11.600
by moralizing driven by a psychological need. So it's typical of the critiques we find in this

26:11.600 --> 26:19.760
book. Our reasoning here is human all to human. In the Four Great Errors passage, this proof by

26:19.760 --> 26:26.160
happiness is examined on another basis. The fact that the proof by happiness is a confusion of the

26:26.160 --> 26:33.680
effect for the cause. Why is this? Because like with Coronaro's diet in which slow metabolism,

26:34.400 --> 26:39.520
you know, a physiology with natural longevity is actually the cause of one's sparse intake of

26:39.520 --> 26:46.560
calories. Nietzsche argues here that one's happiness is the cause of their virtue, not virtue, the

26:46.560 --> 26:53.120
cause of their happiness. That some people are by their very nature, by their very constitution,

26:53.120 --> 26:59.200
happy. The reason why a person lives happily is the same reason that they live virtuously because

26:59.200 --> 27:05.200
of what they are, which means that once again, when we promise that virtuous living creates

27:05.200 --> 27:10.640
happiness, we're reasoning based on a causal chain that we haven't actually established.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.480
Nietzsche writes in Twilight of Idols quote,

27:15.600 --> 27:22.320
A well turned out human being, a happy one, must perform certain actions and shrinks instinctively

27:22.320 --> 27:28.400
from other actions. He carries the order which he represents physiologically into his relations with

27:28.400 --> 27:34.640
other human beings and things. In a formula, his virtue is the effect of his happiness.

27:35.680 --> 27:41.680
A long life, many descendants, this is not the wages of virtue, rather virtue itself

27:42.240 --> 27:48.000
is that slowing down of the metabolism, which leads, among other things, also to a long life,

27:48.000 --> 27:54.080
many descendants, in short, to cornerism. The church and morality say,

27:54.640 --> 28:01.040
A generation, a people are destroyed by license and luxury. My recovered reason says,

28:01.760 --> 28:07.760
When a people approaches destruction, when it degenerates physiologically, then license and

28:07.760 --> 28:15.280
luxury follow from this, namely the craving for ever stronger and more frequent stimulation,

28:15.280 --> 28:22.320
as every exhausted nature knows it. This young man turns pale early in wilts, his friends say,

28:22.880 --> 28:30.400
Well, that is due to this or that disease. I say, that he became diseased, that he did not resist

28:30.400 --> 28:36.880
the disease, was already the effect of an impoverished life or hereditary exhaustion.

28:38.080 --> 28:42.880
The newspaper reader says, The party destroys itself by making such a mistake.

28:43.840 --> 28:50.240
My higher politics says, A party which makes such mistakes has reached its end.

28:51.120 --> 28:59.040
It has lost the sureness of instinct. Every mistake, in every sense, is the effect

28:59.040 --> 29:04.960
of the degeneration of instinct, of the disintegration of the will. One could almost

29:04.960 --> 29:14.080
define what is bad in this way. All that is good is instinct, and hence easy, necessary, free.

29:15.200 --> 29:22.160
Laboriousness is an objection. The God is typically different from the hero. In my language,

29:22.960 --> 29:26.480
light feet are the first attribute of divinity.

29:27.120 --> 29:33.760
End quote. When I read passages like that one in Twilight of Idols, it is almost daunting to

29:33.760 --> 29:39.600
try and unpack it, as they say, because Nietzsche has already condensed everything down to the finest

29:39.600 --> 29:47.520
subtlest version of the point. But Nietzsche asserts here, Virtue is an effect of happiness,

29:47.520 --> 29:52.960
which is a revaluation because it completely inverts the moralist narrative that happiness

29:52.960 --> 29:57.440
only comes as an effect of virtue. This is why Nietzsche says at the beginning of the

29:57.440 --> 30:03.680
four great errors, that this erroneous thinking is hollowed by the names religion and morality.

30:04.480 --> 30:09.120
Because all religion, all morality is based on this proposed causal relation,

30:09.840 --> 30:15.680
where virtue is the cause and happiness the effect. Whether it is the Christian duty to turn away

30:15.680 --> 30:21.600
from your sins, or the Buddhist abandonment of desire, or the Muslim submission to God,

30:21.680 --> 30:28.000
whether it is the deontologist who speaks of moral obligations, or the utilitarian who

30:28.000 --> 30:33.360
preaches the greatest good for the greatest many, or Socrates telling us that eudaimonia

30:33.360 --> 30:39.040
arises from living virtuously. Really, it is with Socrates that Nietzsche finds the

30:40.080 --> 30:45.520
philosopher of this formula. Nietzsche writes in another section of Twilight of Idols,

30:45.520 --> 30:50.960
the problem of Socrates, quote, I tried to understand the idiosyncrasy from which the

30:50.960 --> 30:56.640
Socratic equation, reason equals virtue equals happiness, could have arisen,

30:57.280 --> 31:04.240
the weirdest equation I've ever seen, and one which was essentially opposed to all the instincts

31:04.240 --> 31:10.960
of the older Hellenes, end quote. So once again, Nietzsche would probably suggest that

31:10.960 --> 31:17.760
his notion that happiness is the cause and virtue the effect is closer to the older Greekism,

31:17.760 --> 31:24.160
as he called it, the idea that the good man was good by nature, and thus acted good by nature,

31:24.160 --> 31:30.560
had good feelings by nature, had a healthy diet by nature, was virtuous by nature.

31:31.120 --> 31:36.880
And so to return to the four great errors passage, this is why Nietzsche says that a God has light

31:36.880 --> 31:42.720
feet, because for the person with that natural goodness in them, virtuous actions don't come

31:42.720 --> 31:48.720
as a labor. They don't have to force themselves. They don't have to tyrannize over themselves

31:48.720 --> 31:54.720
in order to comport themselves in a just or admirable way, or to be generous or courageous people.

31:55.680 --> 32:00.320
If that is a burden, it already indicates a disintegrating instinct, a failing health.

32:01.280 --> 32:07.280
Nietzsche then gives a series of examples of the opposite. That one's health is not destroyed by

32:07.280 --> 32:13.360
vice, but one engages in vice because of their failing health. That applies on a societal scale.

32:14.320 --> 32:20.160
This is a point in Nietzsche that oftentimes, I would say both his reactionary interpreters

32:20.160 --> 32:26.400
and his leftist critics fail to understand. Nietzsche would completely disagree with anyone

32:26.400 --> 32:31.600
who thought that the answer to decadence, that is the decline of a civilization,

32:32.800 --> 32:38.640
is to institute some program of virtue, that we're going to get everyone back on the same page,

32:39.280 --> 32:45.920
get everyone to begin acting virtuously again, and through this reinstill the old values of the dying

32:45.920 --> 32:52.880
or dead traditions, and that this will then rejuvenate our society. Because not only is this

32:52.880 --> 32:59.040
remedy sure to fail, on a deeper level, the entire proposition is based on that erroneous

32:59.040 --> 33:06.080
perception, that vice, depraved behavior, sexual license, luxury, and so on, that these are the

33:06.080 --> 33:13.520
cause of society's downfall. Nietzsche says no, the society's downfall causes those things.

33:14.800 --> 33:22.400
The reason? Physiology expanded to a grand scale. The declining physiology always needs

33:22.480 --> 33:28.000
greater and greater stimulation in order to feel anything at all. The same way we might compare

33:28.000 --> 33:34.480
to the taste buds of older people begin to wane, the same way you simply don't get the same thrill

33:34.480 --> 33:39.440
out of something pleasurable, the thousandth time that you do it as you did on the first or the

33:39.440 --> 33:47.120
second time. Furthermore, errors in judgment, errors in thinking, mistakes, these are again

33:47.120 --> 33:51.600
sourced to be the cause of one's downfall. One really Nietzsche's point is if you had been on

33:51.600 --> 33:56.800
top of your game, you wouldn't have made the mistake at all. The mistake didn't cause you to

33:56.800 --> 34:02.560
fail. It's like when in a game of chess you say, you know, I lost because I blundered one of my

34:02.560 --> 34:09.120
pieces. But why did you blunder one of your pieces in the first place? You know, well then you might

34:09.120 --> 34:14.480
say, well because I was tired or I wasn't paying attention. Or I based my move on an instinct

34:14.480 --> 34:19.120
that turned out to be wrong. Sometimes players who are on the verge of defeat just start to

34:19.120 --> 34:23.920
blunder piece after piece. They get irritated and they make riskier moves to try and regain the

34:23.920 --> 34:29.520
advantage and they just lose piece after piece after piece. And so too with the political chess

34:29.520 --> 34:35.200
game with the geopolitical chess game, you know, with a political party, they're defeated not because

34:35.200 --> 34:39.680
they politically miscalculated, they miscalculate because they're on the verge of defeat.

34:41.600 --> 34:47.120
So I think those are all very helpful examples. Now we come to the second error.

34:48.080 --> 34:53.760
The error of false causality. In this error, Nietzsche probes a bit further into our whole

34:53.760 --> 34:59.840
manner of thinking about cause and effect. And he asks, where do we get our faith that we know

34:59.840 --> 35:07.280
what a cause is? And this is a serious logical challenge, I would think, to put to most people

35:07.280 --> 35:12.720
with such common sense notions in their head as to how they come to designate something as a cause

35:12.720 --> 35:18.880
and something else as the effect. Aside from however we might go about logically establishing

35:18.880 --> 35:24.160
this, Nietzsche says, if you want to know the actual reason why people possess this faith and

35:24.160 --> 35:31.440
causality, he thinks it comes from, quote, the realm of the famous inner facts, of which not a

35:31.440 --> 35:38.080
single one has so far been proved to be factual. We believe ourselves to be causal in the act of

35:38.080 --> 35:44.800
willing. We thought that here at least we caught causality in the act. Nor did one doubt that

35:44.800 --> 35:51.600
all the antecedents of an act, its causes, were to be sought in consciousness would be found there

35:51.600 --> 35:59.600
once sought as motives. Else one would not have been free and responsible for it. Finally, who

35:59.600 --> 36:06.800
would have denied that a thought is caused? That the ego causes the thought, end quote.

36:08.240 --> 36:14.400
So this faith and causality, it comes from our own inner experience of willing.

36:15.520 --> 36:21.440
We perceive that our thoughts, our motives have a cause, which is the ego, and that these motives

36:21.440 --> 36:27.680
then cause our actions. But as Nietzsche says, this is a faith. And that is because it's derived

36:27.760 --> 36:32.640
from an intuition. It's derived from a feeling, just a sense that we have that we're the cause of

36:32.640 --> 36:38.560
ourselves and the cause of our actions. But it's not established by evidence or reasoned argument.

36:39.200 --> 36:43.840
It was simply taken as a given that such inner facts are to be taken as true because

36:44.560 --> 36:49.520
what could be more of an immediate certainty than our own perceptions and our own inner feelings.

36:50.400 --> 36:56.800
But Nietzsche thinks there's a mistake here. He says that the so-called motive is an error

36:56.800 --> 37:03.920
because it is, quote, merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something alongside the deed

37:03.920 --> 37:09.280
that is more likely to cover up the antecedents of the deeds than to represent them, end quote.

37:10.880 --> 37:16.320
And Nietzsche says of the alleged origin of our motives, the ego, that it has become, quote,

37:16.880 --> 37:25.440
a fable, a fiction, a play on words. It has altogether ceased to think, feel, or will, end quote.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.800
What Nietzsche means here is that the ego is a narrator, which gives

37:31.360 --> 37:37.280
post hoc explanations for the actions of the organism, which in truth are, quote, unquote,

37:37.280 --> 37:45.200
willed by impulses, which are unconscious. This notion of the self, first seriously proposed by

37:45.200 --> 37:50.960
Nietzsche, would later be expanded into the psychoanalytic school of thought, led by Freud,

37:51.040 --> 37:57.760
carried on by Jung and many others. So the thinking, feeling, and willing does not originate in the ego

37:57.760 --> 38:04.320
in this new understanding. The ego is this self-image, this constantly self-creating narrator

38:04.320 --> 38:11.040
that is attempting to make sense of and justify the actions that are thought, felt, and willed

38:11.040 --> 38:17.280
by unconscious drives. So the ego is not the cause of motives. And motives, as the consciously

38:17.280 --> 38:24.720
articulated explanation for how we act, Nietzsche writes, quote, merely accompanies events. It can

38:24.720 --> 38:30.480
also be absent, end quote. So what is our justification for saying the motive is the cause? In other words,

38:31.440 --> 38:36.880
the motive accompanies the event, yes, the motive that we consciously narrate to ourselves,

38:37.440 --> 38:42.880
accompanies whatever act or deed we are doing, but he says it can also be absent from it.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.320
That's a strange thought, taking an action but with no

38:47.120 --> 38:52.960
conscious motive. But nevertheless, I'm sure almost all of us have had something like this

38:52.960 --> 38:59.440
experience. I mean, when you do something and then later you come to the realization,

38:59.440 --> 39:05.680
I don't know why I did that, right? Shouldn't it be impossible to have that thought? And yet

39:05.680 --> 39:10.560
many people have that thought. Perhaps if we know ourselves fairly well, you know,

39:10.640 --> 39:14.240
you might be able to come up with an explanation after the fact, but that wouldn't change

39:15.360 --> 39:22.240
having the experience of doing something without being conscious of our motives. And if that's the

39:22.240 --> 39:28.400
case, then could conscious motive really be the cause of action? Or is it merely an accompanying

39:28.400 --> 39:36.000
phenomenon, not the cause? So in other words, an event happens, several phenomena occur,

39:36.880 --> 39:42.240
we have a human action, and accompanying that phenomenon, we have the conscious subject who is

39:42.800 --> 39:46.640
taking the action, we have the conscious subject's understanding of their motive for the action.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.920
What is the cause of the action taking place? Nietzsche says that by attributing it to the

39:51.920 --> 39:57.840
motive or to the ego consciousness, we've just leapt to an unjustifiable conclusion.

39:59.280 --> 40:03.680
In light of Nietzsche's new appraisal of the self that would become powerfully influential

40:03.680 --> 40:09.840
on the psychoanalysts, Nietzsche writes, quote, there are no mental causes at all.

40:10.800 --> 40:16.720
The whole of the allegedly empirical evidence for that has gone to the devil, end quote.

40:18.560 --> 40:22.960
But then Nietzsche goes on to suggest that this belief in mental causes is at the root of our

40:22.960 --> 40:29.440
notion of being. What do I mean by that? Well, when we designate a quote unquote cause, we always

40:29.440 --> 40:35.440
have to essentialize events as things. The reason for this is that the entire mental

40:35.440 --> 40:40.720
framework of cause and effect has to separate the effect from the cause, or else it would be

40:40.720 --> 40:46.960
nonsensical. So it has to create a doer and then the deed, a subject, and then the action the subject

40:46.960 --> 40:52.640
takes. But as Nietzsche argues in genealogy of morality, when he says that this is like separating

40:52.640 --> 40:59.040
the lightning from the flash, that's simply a grammatical faith. When we say the lightning

40:59.040 --> 41:04.080
causes the flash, we're saying nothing at all there. We're simply taking an event that happened,

41:04.800 --> 41:12.480
a series of sensations that we had, maybe it's sensations of a routinely repeated and even

41:12.480 --> 41:18.240
scientifically understood phenomenon like lightning. But nevertheless, we're taking an event that

41:18.320 --> 41:23.760
happened, which is inseparable from the process that creates that event. It's all the same thing,

41:23.760 --> 41:29.440
one big process, one big happening, one big becoming. And we're distilling out of that,

41:30.000 --> 41:35.920
a subject that does the thing. Further down in the passage Nietzsche continues quote,

41:36.960 --> 41:44.480
all that happened was considered a doing, all doing the effect of a will. The world became to

41:44.480 --> 41:51.920
it a multiplicity of doers, a doer, a subject was slipped under all that happened. It was out of

41:51.920 --> 41:58.640
himself that man projected his three inner facts, that in which he believed most firmly, the will,

41:58.640 --> 42:05.920
the spirit, the ego. He even took the concept of being from the concept of the ego, he posited

42:05.920 --> 42:13.920
things as being as a cause, small wonder that later he always found in things only that which he had

42:13.920 --> 42:20.960
put into them. The thing itself to say it once more, the concept of thing is a mere reflex of the

42:20.960 --> 42:29.120
faith and the ego as a cause. And even your atom, my dear mechanists and physicists, how much error,

42:29.120 --> 42:34.640
how much rudimentary psychology is still residual in your atom end quote.

42:36.480 --> 42:43.280
So when we slip being beneath everything, that is the creation of the doer that does the deed,

42:43.280 --> 42:48.800
the lightning that does the flashing. Nietzsche's suggestion here is that this is a kind of sly

42:48.800 --> 42:54.480
trickery, it's like a magic trick, sliding the card that the audience member revealed to you

42:54.480 --> 43:00.000
back under the deck, right? That's what we have done with all phenomena. All that is given about

43:00.000 --> 43:04.560
a phenomena is sensation, that's all we know of the world, what is given to us by the senses.

43:05.360 --> 43:12.000
And we are by no means justified in positing being on that basis. These sensations are caused by

43:12.000 --> 43:18.960
definite separate things with their own essence, that is sort of the best I can do it, positing the

43:18.960 --> 43:25.200
ordinary notion of being. But we create the sense through our language, through the creation of the

43:25.200 --> 43:32.000
thing, the subject, the object. This relates to atomism because the atomist is trying to discover

43:32.000 --> 43:39.120
in some sense, the smallest thing, the bedrock of physical existence, the smallest possible particle,

43:39.120 --> 43:44.480
the smallest unit of matter. Because if we were to discover that, we could then say that something

43:45.600 --> 43:51.040
is real, something is existent in the way a platonic form exists, the atom is this thing,

43:51.040 --> 43:57.920
the atom is that enduring unity that we always indicate when we indicate being. And thus, whatever

43:57.920 --> 44:04.160
you may think of atomism, Nietzsche's point here is that the same tendency to think of the world in

44:04.160 --> 44:12.080
terms of being is the same psychological undergirding of that atomist project. Fundamentally, this is

44:12.080 --> 44:18.960
the same thing that undergirds the Theists project. He's articulating the same faith when he makes

44:18.960 --> 44:25.840
spirit the cause of reality. God is the cause of reality. And here that prejudice is articulated

44:25.840 --> 44:31.520
in the same form as its origin, reality as caused by the will of a thinking subject.

44:32.480 --> 44:37.920
That intuition of being a thing that thinks, that's the reason for this type of error,

44:37.920 --> 44:44.160
slipping that thing-ness, that being underneath the ego itself. And so we may say that in the

44:44.160 --> 44:51.520
second great error, Nietzsche has gone farther in critiquing causal thinking itself. The third error,

44:51.520 --> 44:58.160
that of imaginary causes, may at first appear to be less of an attack on causality than, you know,

44:58.240 --> 45:03.440
simply another misapplication of causality. But as we get into this third error, I think it will

45:03.440 --> 45:11.200
become clear there is a even further critique, an even deeper critique here as well. The error of

45:11.200 --> 45:17.760
imaginary causes is best exemplified by dreams. Nietzsche here, again, returns to musings, which

45:17.760 --> 45:22.960
he first put to the page in human all too human, and which were later revisited by Freud in his

45:22.960 --> 45:28.320
work The Interpretation of Dreams. It's a well-known phenomenon that dreamers will experience external

45:28.320 --> 45:35.120
stimuli of some kind, such as a loud sound, light flickering on their eyes, or as is the case in

45:35.120 --> 45:40.320
some of Freud's experiments being tickled with a feather while you sleep, and the dreamer will

45:40.320 --> 45:46.160
incorporate that sensation into the logic of the dream. Nietzsche writes, quote,

45:47.040 --> 45:54.560
A cause is slipped under a particular sensation. For example, one following a far off canon shot,

45:55.200 --> 46:01.280
often a whole little novel in which the dreamer turns up as the protagonist. The sensation endures

46:01.280 --> 46:07.360
meanwhile in a kind of resonance. It waits as it were until the causal instinct permits it to step

46:07.360 --> 46:14.800
into the foreground, now no longer as a chance occurrence, but as meaning. The canon shot appears

46:14.800 --> 46:22.160
in a causal mode, in an apparent reversal of time. What is really later, the motivation,

46:22.160 --> 46:29.280
is experienced first, often with a hundred details which pass like lightning, and the shot follows.

46:30.080 --> 46:36.240
What has happened? The representations which were produced by a certain state have been

46:36.240 --> 46:43.280
misunderstood as its causes, end quote. So the interesting thing about the dreaming mind

46:43.280 --> 46:48.560
is the way in which a sensation is represented to the dreaming subject as a cause of events which

46:48.560 --> 46:55.680
are entirely scripted and represented by the mind alone, for the mind alone. That the events in the

46:55.680 --> 47:02.000
dream are not in fact caused by the canon shot. The canon shot is simply incorporated as the cause

47:02.000 --> 47:06.640
as an event with meaning. The representations that were produced according to the logic of the dream

47:07.200 --> 47:12.000
come from the motivating drives, the entire cacophony of all the organs and impulses within the

47:12.000 --> 47:17.440
dreamer. And dreams also have that funny way of playing with time, as we all know from the film

47:17.440 --> 47:23.440
Inception for example, in which some sense impression the dreamer receives can persist,

47:23.440 --> 47:27.840
resonate as Nietzsche says here, and then be explained after the fact by the dreaming mind.

47:28.800 --> 47:35.440
Which Nietzsche is comparing to the way that we represent the world, our sense organs interact

47:35.440 --> 47:40.240
with our mind in such a way as to produce a representation. The representation of course

47:40.240 --> 47:46.960
comes after the initial stimulus, but Nietzsche says in the logic of the dream this is precisely

47:46.960 --> 47:52.320
reversed, and where Nietzsche makes another radical claim, another challenge to the common sense

47:52.320 --> 47:59.680
wisdom is in the following paragraph, quote, In fact, we do the same thing when awake. Most of

47:59.680 --> 48:06.160
our general feelings, every kind of inhibition, pressure, tension, and explosion in the play

48:06.160 --> 48:11.360
and counterplay of our organs, and particularly in the state of the nervous sympathicus,

48:11.920 --> 48:17.680
excite our causal instinct. We want to have a reason for feeling this way or that,

48:18.400 --> 48:24.960
for feeling bad, or feeling good. We are never satisfied merely to state the fact that we feel

48:24.960 --> 48:31.520
this way or that, we admit this fact only, become conscious of it only, and we have furnished some

48:31.600 --> 48:38.800
kind of motivation. Memory, which swings into action in such cases, unknown to us, brings up

48:38.800 --> 48:43.760
earlier states of the same kind, together with the causal interpretations associated with them,

48:44.560 --> 48:52.240
not their real causes, end quote. This I think is imminently relatable, because for one I think

48:52.240 --> 48:57.840
it's fairly common, it's a fairly common experience that sometimes you just wake up and feel,

48:58.560 --> 49:04.640
for lack of a more descriptive word, happy. You're just having a good day, and you can't even find

49:04.640 --> 49:09.360
any particular reason for it. Or maybe you wake up in a bad mood, you know, you woke up in the

49:09.360 --> 49:14.080
wrong side of the bed, as we say, and then a friend asks you, why are you in such a bad mood?

49:14.720 --> 49:21.520
And then what happens? You begin to search for reasons, some sort of consciously experienced

49:21.520 --> 49:27.200
or consciously articulated cause for why you're in a given mental state or in a given mood.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.800
And the memory begins to present you with all these possibilities. Here's why you might feel

49:32.800 --> 49:37.840
that way. And as Nietzsche coins the phrase, and beyond good and evil, there might not be such a

49:37.840 --> 49:44.160
fine distinction between finding and inventing, Finden und Erfinden, as these words are in German.

49:44.720 --> 49:49.040
There's not as much of a difference between that as those two things, as we would like to think.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.840
Now it's worth noting that in some sense, one could make the argument that it's actually the

49:53.840 --> 49:59.760
point of memory to give you answers to the question, why do I feel this way? Like specifically

49:59.760 --> 50:04.480
answering that question, that's one of the main tasks of memory, because one of the main advantages

50:04.480 --> 50:10.000
of being a remembering organism is that when something isn't working for us, we can course

50:10.000 --> 50:14.960
correct, we can say, I feel bad all the time. What am I doing that's making me feel bad?

50:15.520 --> 50:21.520
And that's an indisputably useful function of memory, because an animal with no self-consciousness

50:21.520 --> 50:27.280
across time doesn't have access to that kind of self-awareness. It might know I feel bad in the

50:27.280 --> 50:32.480
moment. But if you can't string moments together and bring to mind the fact I felt bad every

50:32.480 --> 50:38.480
single day for a week now, then course correction becomes difficult, if not impossible. And so this

50:38.480 --> 50:45.280
is the main use of memory is actually to ask that question. But this is where the Nietzschean

50:45.280 --> 50:50.000
critique of our notions of truth, given the context that we are biological

50:50.640 --> 50:56.560
creatures that were physiological creatures. This is where that comes into play, because then

50:56.560 --> 51:01.840
there's sort of a difficult question that is raised in the wake of this. Does memory actually

51:01.840 --> 51:09.120
establish a firm empirical foundation for positing causal relationships between external events and

51:09.120 --> 51:15.680
how we feel? All memory can do is correlate together all the times I felt a certain way,

51:15.680 --> 51:20.480
and then ask what events preceded that. But can we actually say with certainty that the events

51:20.480 --> 51:26.800
that preceded the way we feel caused that feeling? And if we can't say that with certainty, which I

51:26.800 --> 51:31.840
think would follow from Nietzsche's argument so far, then tracing over all our past memories will

51:31.840 --> 51:36.880
actually not bring us closer to any sort of certainty. It will simply remind us of past

51:36.880 --> 51:42.160
interpretations we've made, past conscious explanations that we've given to ourselves,

51:42.160 --> 51:47.760
post hoc, as to why that we feel the way that we do. And if every one of those past interpretations

51:47.760 --> 51:53.360
was just as erroneous as the one prior to it, this kind of mental habit actually gets us nowhere.

51:54.560 --> 51:59.520
The truth for Nietzsche is that there's this whole interplay of forces in our physiology,

52:00.160 --> 52:04.880
that blind contest of impulses and drives. This is, in truth, why we feel the way we do.

52:05.520 --> 52:09.840
But because none of those causal factors are actually conscious to us, none of them are freely

52:09.840 --> 52:17.760
chosen to say this, to bring this to our attention, as Nietzsche does, as the equivalent of saying,

52:18.320 --> 52:24.720
well, you simply feel this way, and that is that. But that's not satisfying, right?

52:25.920 --> 52:32.800
That explanation, or frankly, that non-explanation, is not satisfying. And why? Well, Nietzsche says

52:32.800 --> 52:37.200
there's a psychological explanation for why it's not satisfying, and it's fairly simple.

52:37.840 --> 52:43.120
To locate a cause is to make known the unknown, and this quote relieves

52:43.120 --> 52:49.520
comforts and satisfies, besides giving a feeling of power, end quote. When we're confronted by

52:49.520 --> 52:55.280
an event beyond our control or understanding, the least we can do in order to not feel overwhelmed

52:55.280 --> 53:01.280
by this is to explain why it is the event is happening, to give the event a meaning. Simply put,

53:01.280 --> 53:07.040
to remain in a situation in which we're surrounded by the unknown is terrifying,

53:07.040 --> 53:12.320
and the mind starts to grab for a cause in order to abolish the sense of terror,

53:12.320 --> 53:18.080
like sort of grasping at vines to claw our way out of that pit, right? And so Nietzsche writes,

53:18.800 --> 53:26.480
quote, first principle, any explanation is better than none. Since at bottom, it is merely a matter

53:26.480 --> 53:32.320
of wishing to be rid of oppressive representations, one is not too particular about the means of

53:32.320 --> 53:38.880
getting rid of them. The first representation that explains the unknown as familiar feels so good

53:38.880 --> 53:46.560
that one quote considers it true, the proof of pleasure, of strength, as a criterion of truth,

53:47.680 --> 53:54.480
end quote. We return to that old bad habit in drawing conclusions that Nietzsche wrote about

53:54.480 --> 53:59.200
way back in human all too human, the proof by pleasure, believe this because it feels good,

53:59.920 --> 54:04.720
in this case, because it abolishes that which feels bad, the sense of the unknown.

54:05.680 --> 54:10.240
It doesn't even have to be a good explanation, any explanation that delivers us from the fear of

54:10.240 --> 54:17.120
the unknown. The first one that seems to work as a cause, we will pick that explanation as soon

54:17.120 --> 54:23.840
as possible, so that we can stop thinking about it. Nietzsche goes on to say, of course,

54:23.840 --> 54:29.520
that we will adopt familiar causes over anything strange, over anything never experienced before.

54:30.320 --> 54:34.720
Whatever we have already inscribed into memory and labeled as a cause will be our go to,

54:35.760 --> 54:40.320
and memory will habituate this kind of thinking as a heuristic for future encounters with the

54:40.320 --> 54:47.360
unknown. The lingering doubt, the mysterious, the unexplained, this is in many ways a torment,

54:48.000 --> 54:53.120
causal thinking is a delivery from that torment, but that doesn't make it true, it just makes it

54:53.120 --> 54:58.480
pleasurable. See, this is the the radical critique that Nietzsche is giving us about the structure

54:58.480 --> 55:05.360
of our thought. Why we think the things that we do, as Deleuze would put it, truth is not an

55:05.360 --> 55:11.360
element of thought. Nietzsche here is saying pleasure is the use of familiar habitual thought

55:11.360 --> 55:16.960
patterns is pleasurable, which is why once this error in thought seeps into our thinking, we just

55:16.960 --> 55:22.880
continue in it insensibly. There's a dimension of this in our own individual psychology as well,

55:23.520 --> 55:29.920
Nietzsche writes, quote, one kind of positing of causes predominates more and more, is concentrated

55:29.920 --> 55:36.560
into a system and finally emerges as dominant, that is, as simply precluding other causes and

55:36.560 --> 55:44.800
explanations. The banker immediately thinks of business, the Christian of sin, and the girl

55:44.800 --> 55:52.560
of her love, end quote. This kind of habituated thought pattern is a common error all its own,

55:53.280 --> 56:00.000
albeit only a subset of this great error. But we've all seen it, I'm sure, the political activist for

56:00.000 --> 56:06.320
whom the cause of everything in life is political, whatever the problem is, that was because of the

56:06.320 --> 56:11.360
politics of the other side, whatever the solution is, or whatever good thing we have going on in

56:11.360 --> 56:16.400
society, that's because of the politics of my side, every single problem is considered politically,

56:16.400 --> 56:21.680
everything is assumed to be the result of this one system of causes, which is dominant in their

56:21.680 --> 56:28.560
thought, and so they ignore all the other causes. Or we might think of the paranoiac, the person who's

56:28.560 --> 56:34.240
dominated by paranoid suspicions and fears. They have an internal problem, they have their own

56:34.240 --> 56:40.320
pathology, their own excessive blood of fearful and suspicious feelings, but they find the causes

56:40.320 --> 56:46.640
of those feelings projected onto the external world. I'm fearful and suspicious not because I'm

56:46.640 --> 56:51.760
paranoid, but because I'm being followed, right? Anything that happens in such a person's life

56:51.760 --> 56:58.480
can be explained by some malevolent external force, some person that they're suspicious of,

56:58.480 --> 57:05.600
and on and on. Carl Jung's notion that everything within the psyche that remains unconscious becomes

57:05.600 --> 57:11.440
projected onto the world, and seen as a sort of external force or external actor, that idea

57:11.440 --> 57:16.640
bears mentioning here because it resembles Nietzsche's idea in this passage. Everything

57:16.640 --> 57:23.440
beneath the surface of consciousness is worked into the same familiar framework and projected onto

57:23.440 --> 57:30.080
an external cause. Nietzsche goes on to argue that, quote, the whole realm of morality and religion

57:30.080 --> 57:36.480
belongs under this concept of imaginary causes, end quote. And what Nietzsche means by this is

57:36.480 --> 57:42.240
quite clear when we look at the concept of sin. How would Nietzsche regard sin, given the critiques

57:42.240 --> 57:49.040
he's made so far about our causal thinking, our misapplications of causality? Well, he says the

57:49.040 --> 57:56.080
feeling of sin is, quote, slipped under a physiological discomfort. One always finds reasons

57:56.080 --> 58:04.160
for being dissatisfied with oneself, end quote. This kind of critique harkens back to the genealogy

58:04.160 --> 58:12.480
of morals, in which Nietzsche says that the priest tells his flock, you sickly sheep, you are to blame

58:12.480 --> 58:19.120
for your own suffering. Nietzsche wonders in that work how it is that such a sick ideology,

58:19.120 --> 58:25.760
such as the ascetic ideal, could ever take hold. And this third great error is one of the elements

58:25.760 --> 58:31.920
of that. The dismal workshop of the psyche that Christianity establishes, in which guilt is actually

58:31.920 --> 58:37.760
heightened, the individuals made to work at making himself feel guiltier and guiltier.

58:38.400 --> 58:42.400
This workshop gets going with the fuel of Rosentum all directed by the priest,

58:43.040 --> 58:50.320
but its operations follow the formula as laid out here in the error of imaginary causes. That is

58:50.320 --> 58:56.880
its structure. That is to say that the individual suffers and without an explanation feels his

58:56.880 --> 59:03.280
suffering to be meaningless. It's part of the unknown, right? The discomfort of the unknown is

59:03.280 --> 59:08.160
a thousand times more painful than the suffering itself, the sense that one's enduring a kind

59:08.160 --> 59:14.880
of meaningless suffering. The priest gives the parishioner suffering meaning, that is his great

59:14.880 --> 59:20.000
benefaction to mankind in a way, that he can make their suffering meaningful, and thus eases the

59:20.000 --> 59:26.160
pain of suffering by attributing it to a cause. Now the entire mechanism of this, in Nietzsche's

59:26.160 --> 59:31.520
view, is very bad because it multiplies the suffering in order to deal with the suffering.

59:32.080 --> 59:36.560
But that's neither here nor there for our purposes in analyzing this passage. The key point

59:36.560 --> 59:40.240
is that by giving the suffering meaning, the priest is engaging in this thinking based on

59:40.240 --> 59:46.160
imaginary causes, and that it's better to have this imaginary cause than no cause at all.

59:47.280 --> 59:51.600
Nietzsche finds that this prejudice is right there in the work of, for example, Schopenhauer,

59:52.160 --> 59:58.400
his once great influence whom he later rejected. Nietzsche quotes world as well in representation,

59:58.400 --> 01:00:05.360
quote, every great pain, whether physical or spiritual, declares what we deserve, for it could

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:12.560
not come to us if we did not deserve it, end quote. Nietzsche criticized this aspect of Schopenhauer's

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.200
thinking, once again in human all to human, where he said that we tend to think that because a

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:23.440
sensation exists, there must be some justification for it. The word deserve in Schopenhauer

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:29.840
is really an attempt to legitimize or justify suffering. Why? Well, in order to give it that

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.720
much needed meaning. What does it mean for suffering to be deserved? Well, it means there

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.360
was some way that it could have been prevented, some way of acting or being that we did not

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:45.440
properly fulfill. And as a result, we must suffer. And Nietzsche argues that reveals the truth of

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:53.040
morality as a poisoner and slanderer of life that it is. Morality always has this idea behind it,

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:59.280
of treating the suffering of life as a punishment for wrong action. Meanwhile, good feelings,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:04.800
good conscience, happiness, that's all conceived as the reward for the consciousness having done

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.760
good deeds, of having acted the proper way. You used your will to obey the laws of God and so on.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.320
And so good feelings are the reward for right action, bad feelings are the punishment for wrong

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:24.480
action. You know, again, the pleasure in these ideas is in giving a meaning to the entire human

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:31.040
psychodrama of feelings and sensations. Nietzsche raises an issue with this as well, though. He

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.360
writes that the so-called good conscience is, quote, a physiological state, which at times

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:43.520
looks so much like good digestion that it is hard to tell them apart, end quote. In other words,

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.560
the reason you're in a good mood is probably because you had a good wholesome meal and no indigestion

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:54.400
while metabolizing it. You say the cause of your happiness is your virtuous deeds. Nietzsche says

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.960
the cause of your happiness is your gut. He also takes issue with what he calls a naïve fallacy,

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:07.120
that happiness comes from the successful completion of some enterprise. That in other words, you

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:13.680
know, we reach a goal that we've we've long tried to attain. You complete some meaningful task or

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.800
project and that's what makes you happy. Nietzsche says, quote, the successful termination of some

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:25.280
enterprise does not by any means give a hypochondriac or a Pascal agreeable feelings, end quote.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:34.320
So to use the example of Blaise Pascal, it seems quite probable to me that Pascal was never happy

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.520
or rarely if ever happy might be a more measured way for me to put it. Pascal was an extreme depressive.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.000
You know, he writes extensively about just how horrible it would be if it turned out that the

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.760
only existence were this world, you know, this world of impermanence and suffering, right? That

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:57.680
the human condition is like being one of many chained prisoners simply awaiting our execution.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.600
That we're like a mode of dust in a chaotic universe whose scale is just beyond any comprehension.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.720
These kinds of terrifying existential thoughts are always sort of storming through Pascal's mind

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.440
and they don't go away when he completes some task or personal challenge. They don't go away when he

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.280
you know, achieves his salvation of his soul through Christianity. So he believes, right?

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.800
If anything, these feelings are heightened now when Pascal becomes a Christian because he begins

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.880
to fear for his own salvation and he writes that salvation is uncertain even for the martyrs

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:41.200
up until the time when you face, you know, the justice of God or so on and so forth, whether

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.320
or not you find out that God will extend his grace to you. We might say the example of the

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:52.160
hypochondriac is also instructive here, you know, types with sustained high anxiety.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.200
The actual circumstances of their lives don't matter that much in terms of regulating the state.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.760
You know, their brains just always invent some reason why they need to be freaking out because

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.480
there's always at least some possibility that you ought to be freaking out. You know, there's always

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.160
could be some medical reason lurking within your physiology that you haven't become aware of yet.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.720
You can always come up with something if your brain is dead set on worrying.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.880
And so again, attributing the cause of your worrying to some definite event or external force

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.880
is an imaginary cause. And that becomes very obvious with such terminally anxious people

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.440
that they simply have something wrong, something that's malfunctioning with their brain that's

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.040
making them anxious. And then in fact, the searching for the imaginary causes of their anxiety is

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.960
actually part of the anxiety. It's actually part of that anxious brain cycle. You know,

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:53.120
similarly to with depression, depressed people aren't sad all the time, because every single

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:59.840
day of their lives is a never ending tragedy of just horrible calamitous things. It's because

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.400
they're incapable of being happy. That doesn't mean that that situation can't change by the way.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.760
I'm not saying you're doomed to depression forever. That's not what I'm saying at all by the way.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.000
I'm not saying there isn't a solution for their depression. It just means that blaming

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:19.120
external circumstances for a repeated sustained feeling that's happening inside of your head.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:25.600
That is rather obviously a mistake. And it's actually part of that whole pathology is to

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:33.040
make those projections. Nietzsche writes, quote, in truth, all these supposed explanations are

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.720
resultant states. And as it were, translations of pleasurable or unpleasurable feelings into a

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:45.040
false dialect. One is in a state of hope because the basic physiological feeling is once again

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:51.200
strong and rich. One trusts in God because the feeling of fullness and strength gives a sense

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:58.480
of rest. Morality and religion belong altogether to the psychology of error. In every single case,

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.280
cause and effect are confused. Or truth is confused with the effects of believing something to be

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:11.920
true. Or a state of consciousness is confused with its causes. End quote. And so at this point,

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:19.280
we arrive at the final great error. Free will. In many ways, free will exemplifies all of these

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.480
errors and thought that we've previously considered. But Nietzsche lists it as a special case. And I

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:30.880
think because from free will, we can infer what it is that sets this entire erroneous thought

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:36.800
process into motion. The germ of the idea of free will Nietzsche alleges comes from what he calls

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.640
the foulest of all the theologians, artifices. So the worst thing that the religious thinkers

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:49.360
have ever created. This is the notion of responsibility, which makes the subject dependent

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:55.440
on the religious caste. This is because responsibility is what sits at the foundations of

01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.800
all morality. This is what we have been articulating throughout this examination when it comes to

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.080
the tendencies of all moralities and religions to promise happiness in exchange for quote unquote

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:13.120
good behavior, and to promise punishment as the wages of sin. Responsibility is the concept required

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.560
for all moralism, without which the moral interpretation of human life just simply falls

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.720
apart. And why do we consider human beings responsible? Why are we responsible for our

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:32.480
actions or for our will? This is because of the belief in the doctrine of free will free will

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.520
responsibility. These concepts are more or less the same thing. We might ask a simple question

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:44.560
therefore. Why seek responsibility? Why would we create such a concept assuming that it is

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:52.560
false as Nietzsche says? Why would we have this notion then quote, wherever responsibilities are

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:58.800
sought? It is usually the instinct of wanting to judge and punish, which is at work. Becoming has

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:05.200
been deprived of its innocence when any being such and such is traced back to will to purposes,

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:11.600
to acts of responsibility. The doctrine of the will has been invented essentially for the purpose

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:18.560
of punishment. That is because one wanted to impute guilt. The entire old psychology, the psychology

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.240
of will, was conditioned by the fact that its originators, the priests at the head of ancient

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.680
communities, wanted to create for themselves the right to punish, or wanted to create this right

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:36.720
for God. Men were considered free so that they might be judged and punished, so that they might

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:43.440
become guilty. Consequently, every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.320
act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness end quote. So this passage is

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:55.760
important in light of the fact that Nietzsche has attempted to make sense of human life with what he

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:02.480
calls an economy of principles. That is to say the greatest possible explanatory power excuse me

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.520
in the fewest possible principles. If human life is to be understood naturalistically then where

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.680
do we get the notion of free will? Here as elsewhere Nietzsche says the answer is will to power.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:21.040
The priestly class, the ascetic types, they create free will, they create moral responsibility

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.840
because it's a means of wielding power. It makes the individuals of the community responsible,

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:32.560
and not just responsible in some sort of abstract sense, responsible to the priest,

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:38.960
who is the intercessor between man and God. If man thinks that there is right action and wrong

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:43.120
action, and that he's morally responsible for choosing right action over wrong,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.200
he will naturally ask the priest, how should I act? And if he's asked, uh,

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.520
actioned wrongly in the past, he'll go to the priest and ask to be absolved.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.640
The priest attained power over the flock by making them guilty. As Nietzsche writes further down in

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:08.560
the passage, quote, Christianity is a metaphysics of the hangman end quote. That is the aim of this

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.720
doctrine of responsibility, which is substantially identical with the doctrine of free will. And

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:20.160
Nietzsche writes that the priests and theologians continue to infect becoming, which is nature in

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.760
its pure innocence, with this guilt, that this is in some sense the ugliest thing that the human

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.320
animal does, and that the human animal does uniquely. It introduces guilt into innocent nature, innocent

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:39.920
becoming. To Nietzsche, therefore, free will is not simply a doctrine that expresses a common

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:47.280
sense truth about the world. It was a weed that was planted in us all for a very specific purpose.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:54.080
And perhaps all such ideas, all such beliefs are planted for a similar such purpose to motivate

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.600
a certain kind of behavior, to express the power of a given drive within mankind.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.680
This doctrine of responsibility, if we examine it in light of a naturalistic understanding of the

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:10.320
world, is a strange and unique thing. It doesn't really fit with the rest of our comprehension

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:16.480
of nature, where we never perceive, we never look for responsibility. We don't see responsibility

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:22.160
in the cosmos and the orbiting bodies slamming into one another or flying off into the abysses of

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:28.480
space. The one place that we find it is in ourselves, due to what we call these inner facts,

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:35.600
actually, conscience, or an intuition that has been inculcated in us and nurtured.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.440
If we examine the doctrine strictly on a logical basis, we find it's premised on great

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.760
leaps of logical supposition, which designate the will as a causal force, the ego as the cause of

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:55.840
the will, and the ego one's self-nature as an uncaused cause, for which one becomes responsible

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:03.200
for themselves, that is, as if one had created himself and decided his own nature. This is a

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:08.160
series of fallacious assumptions, which we're not at all permitted to make according to the facts

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:14.400
at hand. It's nothing but an interpretation based on the attribution of imaginary causes,

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.040
taking something that merely accompanies the event as the cause of the event,

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:25.200
and nature, as he says, is an immoralist who's trying with all his strength to, quote,

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.880
take the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment out of the world again,

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:38.000
and to cleanse psychology, history, nature, and social institutions, end quote.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.840
As this is his goal, he must necessarily oppose himself to the doctrine of free will,

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.600
which is the origin of that stain on the self-consciousness of nature, which is

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:57.840
man. The last section of this chapter, the four great errors, section eight, we can regard as

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:03.760
Nietzsche's mission statement, so to speak. If all of these apparently self-evident beliefs are

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.760
in fact errors, then what doctrine ought we take up instead? And he directly contrasts himself

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.520
with the positions of Kant and Schopenhauer, who both question free will on a strictly logical basis,

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:22.800
but appeal to two things, our intuition of free will, i.e., the way we think about ourselves

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.480
and think about our actions, regardless of the truth of those thoughts, and also to the notion

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.800
of intelligible freedom, that in spite of the fact that we act in one way or another

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.120
in accord with our own nature, meaning that apparently we simply are one way or another,

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:47.840
man must have had a freedom to be this or that kind of person. There must be some kind of choice

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.840
prior to the realization of one's nature. And Nietzsche implies that this is because we've

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.800
always held a more basic and blatantly false prejudice, but one which nevertheless colors

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:05.040
our thinking, that man is the effect of some special purpose or some special destiny.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.840
This kind of thinking is right in line with our entire concept of being,

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.880
which draws these lines of separation between subject and object, between cause and effect,

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:20.880
between one phenomena and another. That man is divided from the rest of nature as a special

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:27.040
quote-unquote thing, a special case, something capable of attaining the ideal of humanity,

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.160
the ideal of happiness, the ideal of morality. But Nietzsche argues, quote,

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:39.680
the fatality of his essence is not to be disentangled from the fatality of all that has been and will

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:47.200
be, end quote. The counter doctrine then to free will and to the entire doctrine of causality,

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:54.880
which includes even the refutation of free will, the doctrine of determinism, all of this is to be

01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:01.360
dismissed in the face of Nietzsche's new doctrine of fate. This is why I tend to call Nietzsche's view

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:08.720
fatalism, in which all apparently separate things and events are part of a vast tapestry. And this

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:14.480
isn't like a mechanistic series of billiard balls clacking into one after the other in a chain of

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.080
causes and effects that must either end in the absurdity of an infinite regress or the equal

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:26.320
absurdity of an uncaused cause. We might say, by the way, the infinite regress absurdity is found

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.160
in determinism, and the uncaused cause absurdity is found in the libertarian free will doctrine.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:38.640
That is what the debate is between. No, Nietzsche is not having any of this, because to even create

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:46.000
that image of existence as a chain, a series of links, is to draw arbitrary divisions to,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.200
from our human perspective, which informs us not one bit about the nature of human independent

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.400
reality, create all of these separate categories and then call them beings or existence or causes

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:02.640
and effects. And in this way, Nietzsche rebukes Kant while retaining his influence from the neocontians,

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.640
which is with Nietzsche all the way from the beginning of his career. He carries forward

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:13.280
that intuition that causality is not something, quote unquote, out there in an objective world.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:21.920
It's something which happens at the intersection of human perception and the so-called external

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.120
world, something that is useful for us as an interpretive framework, even though it may be

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:32.800
a false framework for all that. We'll now look at the final paragraph of the chapter,

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:40.400
the conclusion of the four great errors, quote. One is necessary. One is a piece of faithfulness.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:46.880
One belongs to the whole. One is in the whole. There is nothing which could judge, measure,

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.520
compare, or sentence our being, for that would mean judging, measuring, comparing,

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:57.440
or sentencing the whole. But there is nothing besides the whole, that nobody is held responsible

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.720
any longer, that the mode of being may not be traced back to a cause of prima, that the world

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:09.600
does not form a unity either as a sensorium or as a spirit. That alone is the great liberation.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:16.400
With this alone is the innocence of becoming restored. The concept of God was until now the

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:24.000
greatest objection to existence. We deny God. We deny the responsibility in God. Only thereby do

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:32.000
we redeem the world, end quote. To want one aspect of fate to be different is to want the whole

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.880
thing to be different. The entire interplay of forces would be altered by one force disappearing,

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.880
changing its course or intensity. And yet reality is not to be conceived as a unity,

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:48.080
as a monism, and the way that, say, many of the early pre-platonics thought that reality could

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:54.240
be conceived. No, Nietzsche is with the pluralists, and he's with Heraclitus. The one is the many.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.400
The many is not reducible to a one, but neither is any part of the many to be conceived as a

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:07.520
cause unto itself divided ontologically from the rest of the many. The many remains a many,

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:13.120
not the subject divided from the world of objects. Nietzsche's fatalism therefore

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:20.240
dares us to accept a pluralistic reality, and every event within it, as absolutely necessitated

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:26.240
by a non-purposive relation of forces. If we take that great leap of acceptance,

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:33.040
of regarding every piece of fate as necessary, we affirm the entirety of the great play of

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:39.360
becoming. And if one does this, then imputing guilt or responsibilities to some portion of it

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.800
would be just another absurdity. Because every other part which we affirm and call good can only

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:50.240
exist in relation to those parts that we call bad. That we are to say, along with Spinoza,

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:57.520
that the many modifications of existence, the various phenomena, meaning animals, trees, mountains,

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:05.520
lightning, flash floods, human beings, warfare, disease, weather patterns, all of it, can only

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:12.720
be regarded as good or bad from the standpoint of our limited human reason, from the standpoint of

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:19.120
one particular perspective. None of it is good or bad in and of itself. Because to say that would

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.280
be to deny the whole the right of existence. In Nietzsche's eyes, this is the effect of the

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:31.680
God doctrine, the idea of an eternal moral judge presiding over all being. Being instantiated in

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:37.920
our thought has an eternally existing form of consciousness, and in eternal moral law, which

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:44.240
intercedes in existence, judges and condemns some, affirms and uplifts others, divides all the souls

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:50.720
at the end of time into the good people and the bad people. This is not a healthy view of existence.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:56.400
It's an argument against existence, in fact, because it necessitates, as it were, a judgment

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:02.640
passed against the world. If this world of nature and the people living in it, its states and empires,

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:08.880
are to be judged from the absolute moral standard of Christianity, then the world must be deemed guilty.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:16.400
But we already know where this drive to call the world guilty comes from. Nietzsche suggests

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:22.080
that this is where we should look to determine why it is that we would make such errors as those that

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:28.960
we have considered. Once again, under our apparently cool-headed rationalist view of the world,

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:36.320
we find what is ultimately religious. And that is true, even of those of us

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:44.240
who have formally left religion. These great errors still remain in our thought.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:52.080
That's all for this week, everyone. Thanks for joining me. I'm back at home from after being on

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:57.760
tour. I was sick for a while. I don't know if you can hear it in my voice, maybe it gives my voice

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:04.240
a little more roughness or grit, but I'm getting better. I'm improving. As many of you know,

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.160
if you've been listening for a while, you usually get sick when you're on tour like that.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:15.040
But we've got four more episodes of this season coming out. I'm excited for every one of these.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:19.600
I think these are going to be really good. I'm happy with them regardless of what the

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.280
reception is going to be, but I think it's going to be pretty good. Alright, that's all. Signing off.
