720	7120	If I were to suggest a use for philosophy, I would argue that perhaps its best use is as a tool
7840	16640	for uprooting weeds. Let's assume for a moment that the psyche, the mind, is something like a patch
16640	22000	of earth, and that within our minds we have all sorts of plants that are growing in there,
22000	26640	and you know where the germs for these plants come from it may not always be obvious,
27360	32560	much that's within the mind, remains deep beneath the soil, beneath the surface of our
32560	39760	consciousness. All of us would like to imagine that, at the very least, we are competent gardeners
39760	45200	of our own mental soil, and that only those beliefs and opinions and sentiments which we
45200	53920	planted there, and that we nourish, only those are allowed to grow there. But the reality is,
53920	61120	perhaps, unfortunately, that the ecosystem of the mind is not so consciously planned
61120	66560	as we'd like to imagine it. All sorts of invasive species make their way into the psyche,
67680	73680	and our minds are cross-pollinated, so to speak, with all the other garden plots around us,
73680	81200	all those other individuals, and their beliefs and their opinions. Things were planted in us
81200	86800	before we were born, or before we were old enough to have any understanding of what was being planted.
87920	93600	In short, most of us walk around with the ideas of other people in our heads,
94320	98320	and while this certainly doesn't mean that everything we receive from our culture
98960	106320	and from our upbringing is negative, it does mean that it is a somewhat natural inclination
106960	114400	for human beings to passively or even unconsciously accept any number of what we might call
114400	120800	common-sense notions. Here in modernity, we are more or less comfortable with admitting
121440	129040	that this sort of passive receipt of ideas occurs when it comes to, for example, moral judgments.
129040	135200	It's easy enough to see how a social animal, such as a human being, would naturally mimic
135200	141360	the moral beliefs of other human beings around them, to whatever degree, and whatever you think
141360	148560	about morality, I would say most people are on board with that idea, but this doesn't stop with
148560	156240	morality. Suppose there are prejudices with even deeper roots. Suppose these prejudices are not
156880	163440	simply moral, or that they don't only concern themselves with human behavior and the social
163440	170640	mores. Suppose that we have prejudices that constitute a kind of received wisdom as concerns
170640	177600	the most basic facts of reality, that when it comes to not just how to act, but the nature
177600	183280	of reality itself, we are operating based on a series of beliefs that we've simply passively
183280	191520	accepted. Philosophy finds its use here. It's an activity in disabusing ourselves from believing
191520	198240	in truths that we've received as common sense wisdom with no other justification beyond
198240	204400	that simple fact. Philosophy, in some sense, begins when we start to take note of the ways
204400	210000	in which even the most mundane assertions and statements of opinion contain within them
210000	216800	metaphysical beliefs, and that these metaphysical beliefs have simply been allowed to grow within
216800	224560	your garden without you even taking note of it. Now, suppose that among such received beliefs
224560	231760	that you possess are included beliefs that are in fact errors. Mistakes, perhaps owing to an
231760	237120	inherent flaw in human psychology, or whatever the case may be, and that nevertheless such a
237120	243760	mistake has simply been allowed to propagate or even been called self-evident. This is what we
243760	250640	would call a weed. We could in fact characterize the various great philosophers according to which
250640	257200	weeds they set themselves the task of uprooting. So with Socrates, the unquestioned way of life
257200	264240	of the Athenians set by religion and tradition, Descartes, the prejudice that the external world
264240	271120	in our perception of it can simply be taken for granted. Rousseau, the faith that civilization
271120	278480	has improved mankind. Hegel, that things are things in themselves, separable from the things to
278480	284720	which they are related, and so on and so forth. We've defined all these philosophers by what
284720	290160	they're attacking, right? In some sense, philosophy always begins within attack on a view that the
290160	296080	philosopher has realized to be nothing more than an assumption, an unquestionable assumption,
296080	302880	because it's assumed by so many. As we all know by now, Friedrich Nietzsche was a prodigious critic,
303600	310000	and if we were to say that philosophy begins at this point of attack, you'd also have to say
310960	318480	few philosophized as hard as Nietzsche did. He never declared peace. His critique of modern
318480	324160	thought begins in his first book, and it continues through to the very end. His targets are numerous,
324800	329760	among the assumptions that he attempted to weed out are, well, morality itself,
330640	334640	or the notion of a true world, an intelligible world behind the senses,
335680	340800	an intuition that begins in philosophy but becomes passively accepted through religion.
341840	348400	Nietzsche also attempts to uproot nihilism or world weariness, sentiments that Nietzsche believed
348400	355120	were suffused throughout modern culture. Already, these are sort of titanic, monstrous weeds that
355120	361760	Nietzsche has decided to wrestle with. Today, we're going to take a look at one of those critical
361760	369200	passages in Nietzsche, which is in Twilight of Idols. Many of the sections contained in Twilight
369200	376160	of Idols are Nietzsche's attempts to summarize or condense ideas that he'd written about for
376160	382240	over a decade by this point. This section is no different. It is called The Four Great Errors.
383120	388720	I've discussed this section a long time ago on the podcast in the episode on free will,
388720	392480	and I think it's been brought up in one or two other episodes over the years.
393840	397600	But this passage is important enough on its own to warrant its own discussion.
398160	402240	It was relevant to our discussion on free will because the Four Great Errors
403040	407120	is the most significant passage for comprehending Nietzsche's view on that subject,
407680	413680	above pretty much all other passages in Nietzsche's corpus. And in The Four Great Errors, he attacks
413680	420480	free will, but without falling into the determinist camp. The reason he doesn't fall into that
420480	425920	camp is because the criticism in The Four Great Errors is targeted at our whole mental framework
425920	431360	of cause and effect, or rather the way in which cause and effect are applied in our thought.
432400	438480	Nietzsche can't be a determinist because he's not even convinced that our will is bound within
438480	445280	an infinite net of causes. That would be the normal determinist critique of the libertarian
445280	452000	free will doctrine, but it would still fundamentally be the same error. And while Nietzsche doesn't
452000	458880	quite come up to the point of denying causality altogether, he calls into question all of the
458960	463760	commonplace habits in our thinking about causality, that color the way that we make
463760	469840	sense of reality, that what we designate as a cause and what we designate as effect
470560	476560	is often an arbitrary distinction. Usually the reason for distinguishing the cause from the effect
477120	483760	accords with some kind of psychological need or inclination, rather than what might be a sober
483760	490640	understanding of reality. Furthermore, we often reason backward to determine the so-called cause
490640	496720	of a given event. The mind will invent causes where one is not immediately perceptible.
497840	502960	Free will is merely one of the erroneous thought processes that Nietzsche draws our
502960	509680	attention to in this passage. But in fact, this type of error goes all the way down to our very
509680	518240	conception of being, of a reality full of quote unquote things that are consistent, unitary,
518240	525040	coherent. In other words, existence or beings. Again, one of those apparently self-evident
525040	530480	truths contained within that word being, that nevertheless has metaphysical implications
530480	536880	about reality itself, and that we nevertheless all use on a daily basis because it's baked into
536960	543200	the structure of our language. So first, I'll list off these four errors, and then we'll get
543200	548080	into the nuts and bolts of the passage in which Nietzsche explains what he means by each and gives
548080	557680	examples. The errors are as follows. One, the error of confusing cause and effect. This is quite
557680	565840	straightforward. We believe something is a cause when actually it's an effect. Two, the error of
565840	573040	false causality. That is, we believe something is in a causal relationship when in fact it only
573040	579760	accompanies the so-called effect, and that we've not actually established a causal relationship.
581200	588720	Three, the error of imaginary causes. We invent causes based on a sensation or a mental state,
589360	595440	and Nietzsche says that this is in order to justify that mental state. And finally,
595440	601840	four, the error of free will. A specific example of such an error in our causal thinking.
603440	607280	And on closer inspection, the error of free will points to a more profound error,
608080	614080	that we establish such cause and effect relationships such as the ego causing one's actions
614960	621360	because of a psychological necessity, the perceived consequences of believing in this
621360	627440	causal relationship, the consequences of holding the belief, or the consequences of not holding the
627440	634880	belief. That's what actually motivates the belief itself, or perceived or imagined consequences
635840	640080	of if we hold the belief what happens, if we don't hold the belief what happens,
640080	646000	what are the consequences for humanity. So, confusing cause and effect, false causality,
646000	652000	imaginary causes, and then freedom of the will. With that introduction, let's look to the passage.
653200	657520	The beginning of the four great errors concerns the error of confusing cause and effect,
657520	664160	and Nietzsche explains this error through the example of Alvice Cornaro. So, Cornaro is a writer
664240	671120	and an architect during the Italian Renaissance period. He's born in the 15th century in Padua,
671120	676720	although the exact date of his birth is disputed, and I bring this up because it's disputed for
676720	682880	an interesting reason which we'll discuss in a moment, but Cornaro is born sometime between the
682880	692000	1460s and the 1480s, and he lived until 1566. Although he's related to a noble family from
692000	699760	Venice, Cornaro is merely the son of an innkeeper. He would sort of draw upon that relation to
699760	705680	nobility because of the prestige of it, but in fact, he's from a lesser branch of the family,
705680	712560	but he's able to take what little money his family had and became a rather successful entrepreneur.
714160	718160	He's a somewhat interesting character, actually. He had little scientific training.
719120	723920	He attended university in Venice, but he dropped out because he felt that the education he received
723920	731120	was overly philosophical. It was disconnected from practical knowledge, which tells us something
731120	737760	about him right there. He made his fortune by obtaining permission to attempt to reclaim land
738320	745440	from the lagoon near Venice on the Adriatic Sea. So, what Cornaro does is he successfully applied
745520	753840	the science of hydraulics to turn this portion of the lagoon into wheat fields and fishing ponds.
754560	760240	This is good for Cornaro as a business venture, and it's good for the city because the lagoon,
760240	766560	it causes swarms of insects in the summertime and winter fogs. It smells terrible. There's just
766560	771520	all sorts of problems. It's much better to have wheat fields and fishing ponds next to your city
771520	781840	than a stinky, hazardous lagoon. So, after this, Cornaro publishes a treatise on water management,
782480	786800	and he would go on to become a patron of the arts with the wealth that he made from
787520	792880	ventures like this, and he is credited with introducing the Roman Renaissance style of
792880	798400	architecture into Northern Italy. None of this is why Cornaro is of interest to Nietzsche,
798400	805040	by the way. Nietzsche's fascination with the example of Cornaro is due to a series of treatises
805040	811680	that he published later in his life. Cornaro is known as a humanist to this very day because he
811680	817760	attacked a prejudice that was common in medieval European society and had lingered. It was popular
817760	824480	up to his own time, and this is the view that old age is nothing but a period of pain and decay.
825440	830880	You know, this is the harsh winter of life. The years that you spend as an elderly person
830880	838000	are not but suffering, and that this is in some way simply the natural order of human life. That
838000	844640	you should expect this and endure it stoically, but just know that when you get to old age,
844640	849760	it's going to be a bad time. You know, you can rejoice because your body is about to be
849760	855040	rejuvenated in heaven, but it's more or less accepted that one's physical existence at the
855040	862960	end of their natural life is, well, bad. Cornaro lives to a very old age, and he says on the contrary,
863680	870000	one's elderly years are the most beautiful period of life. He says that God wills all of us to live
870000	878560	long and healthy lives, and to live to reach this best age of one's lifetime, because in old age,
878560	885760	all of your accumulated wisdom allows you to see the world with new eyes or with just a better,
885760	892080	higher perspective than the youth have on life. And so, Cornaro becomes a kind of health and
892080	899920	longevity advocate, and he lives to either his 90s or to be over 100 years old, his exact age
899920	905600	when he dies is disputed because we have various birth dates for him, with some sources saying he
905600	916400	was born in 1464, although it seems more likely he was born in the 1480s. That's just my belief
916400	922720	that as Cornaro becomes a sort of guru on longevity, people begin to overestimate his age. It becomes
922720	928400	exaggerated just how old this man lived to be. That's not an unusual phenomenon at all. It's
928480	936640	very common among, for example, Taoist sages or Zen masters in the East. In any case, he did live to
936640	941680	a very old age for somebody living in the 15th century, and so we finally come to the main point
941680	947840	on which Nietzsche will use Cornaro in order to demonstrate a great error in thinking. Cornaro
947840	952880	began to suffer from gastrointestinal problems and feverishness when he was around 35 years old.
953680	959360	His doctors advised him to eat a very sparse diet, and Cornaro restricted himself to 12 ounces of
959360	970000	food a day. Bread, egg yolk, meat, and soup, and 14 ounces of wine every day. So when he was in his
970000	975040	80s, he was asked to write a treatise on his secret to longevity, and Cornaro attributed his
975040	984320	good health to this diet. And Cornaro genuinely believed that liberality in one's diet, gluttonous
984320	990800	consumption of food and drink, he says this is contrary to the will of God, and this is evidenced
990800	998480	by the fact that it shortens your life. By living virtuously, by consuming only the caloric intake
998480	1005680	that you absolutely need, one earns a long life. And it's worth noting, aside from this religious
1005680	1012880	or moral dimension of Cornaro's thought, this popular wisdom of caloric reduction
1013760	1019280	would remain in the zeitgeist for hundreds of years afterwards. This was true up through Nietzsche's
1019680	1028560	time. The popular wisdom that Nietzsche calls coronarism is not really overturned until the 20th
1028560	1036240	century. And so now the passage Nietzsche writes, quote, everyone knows the book of the famous Cornaro
1036240	1042880	in which he recommends his slender diet as a recipe for a long and happy life, a virtuous one too.
1043840	1048880	Few books have been read so much, even now thousands of copies are sold in England every year.
1049760	1056560	I do not doubt that scarcely any book, except the Bible as is made, has done as much harm,
1056560	1064560	has shortened as many lives as this well-intentioned curiosity. The reason? The mistaking of the
1064560	1071360	effect for the cause. The worthy Italian thought his diet was the cause of his long life, whereas the
1071440	1077760	precondition for a long life, the extraordinary slowness of his metabolism, the consumption of
1077760	1085760	so little was the cause of his slender diet. He was not free to eat little or much. His frugality
1085760	1093200	was not a matter of, quote, unquote, free will. He became sick when he ate more. But whoever is
1093200	1099920	no carp not only does well to eat properly, but needs to, a scholar in our own time with his
1099920	1105200	rapid consumption of nervous energy, would simply destroy himself with Cornaro's diet,
1105920	1114560	crede experto, end quote. That last line means, believe him who has tried, credit the expert.
1115120	1121120	So implicitly, Nietzsche is tying himself to the type of the nervous modern scholarly type.
1121120	1127120	At least he was at one time during his professor days. So again, who says that Nietzsche can't
1127120	1133440	take a shot at himself every once in a while. In any case, as we've discussed many times on the
1133440	1139200	podcast, Nietzsche spent quite a lot of time experimenting with his own diet. He believed
1139200	1145600	there was a very real link between your overall physical and mental health. And that one's daily
1145600	1151360	habits, your daily intake of food, you shouldn't simply go about these things thoughtlessly.
1152320	1156240	The question of Nietzsche's own diet and his views on diet are somewhat fascinating,
1156240	1161040	but the key point to understand about this is that Nietzsche has come to understand something
1161040	1167840	that I think most nutritionists today would agree with. There is no universal diet. Now,
1167840	1173520	this doesn't mean there's no definite claim that we can make about what is healthy and unhealthy
1173520	1179440	in general. But different people have different physiological needs, different lifestyles,
1180320	1184320	just different restrictions on what they can or should eat for their best health.
1184320	1189280	And Nietzsche learns that through first hand experience. He also sees that the eating habits
1189280	1195040	of European countries differ dramatically, such as when he compares the eating habits of Germans
1195040	1200880	to that of the Italians and so on. As a result, he's able to see that Coronaro's diet can't be a
1200880	1207760	panacea, that in fact, it was right for Coronaro, but that it would not be right for many others.
1207760	1212800	And if this is the case, this means that Coronaro's diet may have shortened a few lives
1212800	1219440	rather than lengthened them, that people with a higher caloric need might have fallen victim to
1219440	1224800	thinking that, you know, Coronaro's diet is the cause of his longevity. As I noted earlier,
1224800	1231040	this isn't a critique of cause and effect as such. In fact, Nietzsche says that Coronaro's
1231040	1236640	longevity is the cause of his diet. If you pay attention, that's actually a very funny claim,
1236640	1244160	but he makes it quite clear a slow metabolism is the cause of a long life. This kind of thinking
1244160	1248720	in Nietzsche, by the way, goes all the way back to his lectures in the pre-plotonics,
1248720	1253440	where he references the thought experiment by the philosopher of science, von Baer,
1254240	1260000	in which it is imagined that pulse rate correlates with one's experience of the passage of time.
1260880	1264880	That is one hypothesis that as far as I understand has not been borne out in terms of
1264880	1271280	modern scientific knowledge, as Nietzsche's insights on nutrition perhaps have. But that said,
1271280	1277600	this colors Nietzsche's thinking, there's a speed to one's physiological existence, that we can
1277600	1283760	measure the existence of a phenomena, in some sense, by the tempo at which it manifests.
1284960	1291920	But if Coronaro's metabolism is what causes his long life, his slow rate of metabolizing
1291920	1300000	sort of equates to a slow and long-lived existence, then that means that his physiology,
1300000	1307680	what he is, is what accounts for his dietary needs. And in spite of all the unanswered questions that
1307680	1314800	still remain concerning diet even to this day, it seems quite clear that on an epistemological level,
1315360	1320960	the causal relationship has not been established here. That if we are to admit that once diet
1320960	1326160	depends on their physiology, then is their physiology not the cause of their optimal diet
1326160	1331200	rather than the optimal diet, the cause of the state of their physiology? We could of course say
1331200	1336640	that living at variance with your optimal diet could be the cause of an early death, or living
1336640	1342080	in accord with your optimal diet is the cause of a long life. But in that case, couldn't we just
1342080	1348160	take the argument a step further? Why can't this person eat only according to their ideal diet?
1349040	1355280	Maybe somebody really needs to have just red meat and potatoes and vegetables,
1356640	1361920	why is it that they're always eating junk food? Well, maybe they have no impulse control. So why
1361920	1366640	do they not have good impulse control? Isn't there a physiological reason for that too?
1367600	1375120	Something about just their nature that makes them crave junk food and so on and so on, right?
1375120	1382480	It's very hard to draw the line at a certain point and say, this is the final cause. That's one of
1382480	1387680	the things that's sort of implicit behind this critique of our causal thinking is that in some
1387680	1392000	sense, it's always arbitrary where we say, no, this is the cause. Somebody can always come along
1392000	1397360	and say, okay, but what's the cause of that? And this answer doesn't satisfy us with our common
1397360	1402640	sense wisdom, right? Why is it not satisfying? It's because we've been taught a certain mental
1402640	1408240	framework throughout our whole lives that tells us exactly the opposite. And Nietzsche says that
1408240	1415840	this radical idea here is pointing to this very error is the first example of his revaluation
1415840	1422480	of all values. He writes that quote, the most general formula on which every religion and
1422480	1430640	morality is founded, quote, do this and that, refrain from this and that, then you will be happy.
1431600	1440160	Otherwise, end quote. That's what Nietzsche calls the original sin of reason in this passage in
1440160	1445440	Twilight of Idols. But I should note here that this tendency and thought was observed by Nietzsche
1445440	1450480	as early as human all to human. It's what he characterized there as one of the most common
1450480	1456080	false conclusions arrived at by human reason. For the sake of comparison with the four great
1456080	1462640	errors, let's look at section 227 of human all to human, where Nietzsche writes quote, Christianity,
1462640	1468160	which was very innocent in its intellectual ideas, demanded faith and nothing but faith,
1468160	1474160	and passionately rejected the desire for reasons. It pointed to the successful result of faith.
1474960	1479840	You'll soon discover the advantage of faith is suggested. You'll be blessed because of it.
1480720	1486160	The state, in fact, does the same thing, and each father raises his son in the same way.
1486880	1491280	Just take this to be true, he says. You'll discover how good it feels.
1492400	1497760	But this means that the truth of an opinion should be proved by its personal benefit.
1498560	1502640	The usefulness of a teaching should guarantee its intellectual certainty
1502640	1507120	and substantiation. This is as if the defendant were to say in court,
1507680	1513600	my defender is telling the whole truth for just see what happens as a result of his plea. I am
1513600	1523440	acquitted. End quote. So Nietzsche's point here, and human all to human, is that the proof for a
1523440	1529440	given proposition in this formula is the happiness that the proposition creates. Do this and you
1529440	1535120	will be happy. Believe this, you will discover how good it feels. The church called this the proof by
1535120	1540400	pleasure. Nietzsche's point in human all to human is much more straightforward than it is in the
1540400	1545440	Four Great Errors passage in Twilight of Idols. In human all to human Nietzsche is simply exposing
1545440	1552560	the fact that this is a paralogism, a false syllogism that does not serve as proof of anything.
1553280	1558160	Nietzsche's point here is simply this reasoning is false. It's incredibly common,
1558880	1565120	but nonetheless it's false. Another example of human fallibility and reasoning often covered over
1565120	1571600	by moralizing driven by a psychological need. So it's typical of the critiques we find in this
1571600	1579760	book. Our reasoning here is human all to human. In the Four Great Errors passage, this proof by
1579760	1586160	happiness is examined on another basis. The fact that the proof by happiness is a confusion of the
1586160	1593680	effect for the cause. Why is this? Because like with Coronaro's diet in which slow metabolism,
1594400	1599520	you know, a physiology with natural longevity is actually the cause of one's sparse intake of
1599520	1606560	calories. Nietzsche argues here that one's happiness is the cause of their virtue, not virtue, the
1606560	1613120	cause of their happiness. That some people are by their very nature, by their very constitution,
1613120	1619200	happy. The reason why a person lives happily is the same reason that they live virtuously because
1619200	1625200	of what they are, which means that once again, when we promise that virtuous living creates
1625200	1630640	happiness, we're reasoning based on a causal chain that we haven't actually established.
1631840	1634480	Nietzsche writes in Twilight of Idols quote,
1635600	1642320	A well turned out human being, a happy one, must perform certain actions and shrinks instinctively
1642320	1648400	from other actions. He carries the order which he represents physiologically into his relations with
1648400	1654640	other human beings and things. In a formula, his virtue is the effect of his happiness.
1655680	1661680	A long life, many descendants, this is not the wages of virtue, rather virtue itself
1662240	1668000	is that slowing down of the metabolism, which leads, among other things, also to a long life,
1668000	1674080	many descendants, in short, to cornerism. The church and morality say,
1674640	1681040	A generation, a people are destroyed by license and luxury. My recovered reason says,
1681760	1687760	When a people approaches destruction, when it degenerates physiologically, then license and
1687760	1695280	luxury follow from this, namely the craving for ever stronger and more frequent stimulation,
1695280	1702320	as every exhausted nature knows it. This young man turns pale early in wilts, his friends say,
1702880	1710400	Well, that is due to this or that disease. I say, that he became diseased, that he did not resist
1710400	1716880	the disease, was already the effect of an impoverished life or hereditary exhaustion.
1718080	1722880	The newspaper reader says, The party destroys itself by making such a mistake.
1723840	1730240	My higher politics says, A party which makes such mistakes has reached its end.
1731120	1739040	It has lost the sureness of instinct. Every mistake, in every sense, is the effect
1739040	1744960	of the degeneration of instinct, of the disintegration of the will. One could almost
1744960	1754080	define what is bad in this way. All that is good is instinct, and hence easy, necessary, free.
1755200	1762160	Laboriousness is an objection. The God is typically different from the hero. In my language,
1762960	1766480	light feet are the first attribute of divinity.
1767120	1773760	End quote. When I read passages like that one in Twilight of Idols, it is almost daunting to
1773760	1779600	try and unpack it, as they say, because Nietzsche has already condensed everything down to the finest
1779600	1787520	subtlest version of the point. But Nietzsche asserts here, Virtue is an effect of happiness,
1787520	1792960	which is a revaluation because it completely inverts the moralist narrative that happiness
1792960	1797440	only comes as an effect of virtue. This is why Nietzsche says at the beginning of the
1797440	1803680	four great errors, that this erroneous thinking is hollowed by the names religion and morality.
1804480	1809120	Because all religion, all morality is based on this proposed causal relation,
1809840	1815680	where virtue is the cause and happiness the effect. Whether it is the Christian duty to turn away
1815680	1821600	from your sins, or the Buddhist abandonment of desire, or the Muslim submission to God,
1821680	1828000	whether it is the deontologist who speaks of moral obligations, or the utilitarian who
1828000	1833360	preaches the greatest good for the greatest many, or Socrates telling us that eudaimonia
1833360	1839040	arises from living virtuously. Really, it is with Socrates that Nietzsche finds the
1840080	1845520	philosopher of this formula. Nietzsche writes in another section of Twilight of Idols,
1845520	1850960	the problem of Socrates, quote, I tried to understand the idiosyncrasy from which the
1850960	1856640	Socratic equation, reason equals virtue equals happiness, could have arisen,
1857280	1864240	the weirdest equation I've ever seen, and one which was essentially opposed to all the instincts
1864240	1870960	of the older Hellenes, end quote. So once again, Nietzsche would probably suggest that
1870960	1877760	his notion that happiness is the cause and virtue the effect is closer to the older Greekism,
1877760	1884160	as he called it, the idea that the good man was good by nature, and thus acted good by nature,
1884160	1890560	had good feelings by nature, had a healthy diet by nature, was virtuous by nature.
1891120	1896880	And so to return to the four great errors passage, this is why Nietzsche says that a God has light
1896880	1902720	feet, because for the person with that natural goodness in them, virtuous actions don't come
1902720	1908720	as a labor. They don't have to force themselves. They don't have to tyrannize over themselves
1908720	1914720	in order to comport themselves in a just or admirable way, or to be generous or courageous people.
1915680	1920320	If that is a burden, it already indicates a disintegrating instinct, a failing health.
1921280	1927280	Nietzsche then gives a series of examples of the opposite. That one's health is not destroyed by
1927280	1933360	vice, but one engages in vice because of their failing health. That applies on a societal scale.
1934320	1940160	This is a point in Nietzsche that oftentimes, I would say both his reactionary interpreters
1940160	1946400	and his leftist critics fail to understand. Nietzsche would completely disagree with anyone
1946400	1951600	who thought that the answer to decadence, that is the decline of a civilization,
1952800	1958640	is to institute some program of virtue, that we're going to get everyone back on the same page,
1959280	1965920	get everyone to begin acting virtuously again, and through this reinstill the old values of the dying
1965920	1972880	or dead traditions, and that this will then rejuvenate our society. Because not only is this
1972880	1979040	remedy sure to fail, on a deeper level, the entire proposition is based on that erroneous
1979040	1986080	perception, that vice, depraved behavior, sexual license, luxury, and so on, that these are the
1986080	1993520	cause of society's downfall. Nietzsche says no, the society's downfall causes those things.
1994800	2002400	The reason? Physiology expanded to a grand scale. The declining physiology always needs
2002480	2008000	greater and greater stimulation in order to feel anything at all. The same way we might compare
2008000	2014480	to the taste buds of older people begin to wane, the same way you simply don't get the same thrill
2014480	2019440	out of something pleasurable, the thousandth time that you do it as you did on the first or the
2019440	2027120	second time. Furthermore, errors in judgment, errors in thinking, mistakes, these are again
2027120	2031600	sourced to be the cause of one's downfall. One really Nietzsche's point is if you had been on
2031600	2036800	top of your game, you wouldn't have made the mistake at all. The mistake didn't cause you to
2036800	2042560	fail. It's like when in a game of chess you say, you know, I lost because I blundered one of my
2042560	2049120	pieces. But why did you blunder one of your pieces in the first place? You know, well then you might
2049120	2054480	say, well because I was tired or I wasn't paying attention. Or I based my move on an instinct
2054480	2059120	that turned out to be wrong. Sometimes players who are on the verge of defeat just start to
2059120	2063920	blunder piece after piece. They get irritated and they make riskier moves to try and regain the
2063920	2069520	advantage and they just lose piece after piece after piece. And so too with the political chess
2069520	2075200	game with the geopolitical chess game, you know, with a political party, they're defeated not because
2075200	2079680	they politically miscalculated, they miscalculate because they're on the verge of defeat.
2081600	2087120	So I think those are all very helpful examples. Now we come to the second error.
2088080	2093760	The error of false causality. In this error, Nietzsche probes a bit further into our whole
2093760	2099840	manner of thinking about cause and effect. And he asks, where do we get our faith that we know
2099840	2107280	what a cause is? And this is a serious logical challenge, I would think, to put to most people
2107280	2112720	with such common sense notions in their head as to how they come to designate something as a cause
2112720	2118880	and something else as the effect. Aside from however we might go about logically establishing
2118880	2124160	this, Nietzsche says, if you want to know the actual reason why people possess this faith and
2124160	2131440	causality, he thinks it comes from, quote, the realm of the famous inner facts, of which not a
2131440	2138080	single one has so far been proved to be factual. We believe ourselves to be causal in the act of
2138080	2144800	willing. We thought that here at least we caught causality in the act. Nor did one doubt that
2144800	2151600	all the antecedents of an act, its causes, were to be sought in consciousness would be found there
2151600	2159600	once sought as motives. Else one would not have been free and responsible for it. Finally, who
2159600	2166800	would have denied that a thought is caused? That the ego causes the thought, end quote.
2168240	2174400	So this faith and causality, it comes from our own inner experience of willing.
2175520	2181440	We perceive that our thoughts, our motives have a cause, which is the ego, and that these motives
2181440	2187680	then cause our actions. But as Nietzsche says, this is a faith. And that is because it's derived
2187760	2192640	from an intuition. It's derived from a feeling, just a sense that we have that we're the cause of
2192640	2198560	ourselves and the cause of our actions. But it's not established by evidence or reasoned argument.
2199200	2203840	It was simply taken as a given that such inner facts are to be taken as true because
2204560	2209520	what could be more of an immediate certainty than our own perceptions and our own inner feelings.
2210400	2216800	But Nietzsche thinks there's a mistake here. He says that the so-called motive is an error
2216800	2223920	because it is, quote, merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something alongside the deed
2223920	2229280	that is more likely to cover up the antecedents of the deeds than to represent them, end quote.
2230880	2236320	And Nietzsche says of the alleged origin of our motives, the ego, that it has become, quote,
2236880	2245440	a fable, a fiction, a play on words. It has altogether ceased to think, feel, or will, end quote.
2247040	2250800	What Nietzsche means here is that the ego is a narrator, which gives
2251360	2257280	post hoc explanations for the actions of the organism, which in truth are, quote, unquote,
2257280	2265200	willed by impulses, which are unconscious. This notion of the self, first seriously proposed by
2265200	2270960	Nietzsche, would later be expanded into the psychoanalytic school of thought, led by Freud,
2271040	2277760	carried on by Jung and many others. So the thinking, feeling, and willing does not originate in the ego
2277760	2284320	in this new understanding. The ego is this self-image, this constantly self-creating narrator
2284320	2291040	that is attempting to make sense of and justify the actions that are thought, felt, and willed
2291040	2297280	by unconscious drives. So the ego is not the cause of motives. And motives, as the consciously
2297280	2304720	articulated explanation for how we act, Nietzsche writes, quote, merely accompanies events. It can
2304720	2310480	also be absent, end quote. So what is our justification for saying the motive is the cause? In other words,
2311440	2316880	the motive accompanies the event, yes, the motive that we consciously narrate to ourselves,
2317440	2322880	accompanies whatever act or deed we are doing, but he says it can also be absent from it.
2323600	2326320	That's a strange thought, taking an action but with no
2327120	2332960	conscious motive. But nevertheless, I'm sure almost all of us have had something like this
2332960	2339440	experience. I mean, when you do something and then later you come to the realization,
2339440	2345680	I don't know why I did that, right? Shouldn't it be impossible to have that thought? And yet
2345680	2350560	many people have that thought. Perhaps if we know ourselves fairly well, you know,
2350640	2354240	you might be able to come up with an explanation after the fact, but that wouldn't change
2355360	2362240	having the experience of doing something without being conscious of our motives. And if that's the
2362240	2368400	case, then could conscious motive really be the cause of action? Or is it merely an accompanying
2368400	2376000	phenomenon, not the cause? So in other words, an event happens, several phenomena occur,
2376880	2382240	we have a human action, and accompanying that phenomenon, we have the conscious subject who is
2382800	2386640	taking the action, we have the conscious subject's understanding of their motive for the action.
2387600	2391920	What is the cause of the action taking place? Nietzsche says that by attributing it to the
2391920	2397840	motive or to the ego consciousness, we've just leapt to an unjustifiable conclusion.
2399280	2403680	In light of Nietzsche's new appraisal of the self that would become powerfully influential
2403680	2409840	on the psychoanalysts, Nietzsche writes, quote, there are no mental causes at all.
2410800	2416720	The whole of the allegedly empirical evidence for that has gone to the devil, end quote.
2418560	2422960	But then Nietzsche goes on to suggest that this belief in mental causes is at the root of our
2422960	2429440	notion of being. What do I mean by that? Well, when we designate a quote unquote cause, we always
2429440	2435440	have to essentialize events as things. The reason for this is that the entire mental
2435440	2440720	framework of cause and effect has to separate the effect from the cause, or else it would be
2440720	2446960	nonsensical. So it has to create a doer and then the deed, a subject, and then the action the subject
2446960	2452640	takes. But as Nietzsche argues in genealogy of morality, when he says that this is like separating
2452640	2459040	the lightning from the flash, that's simply a grammatical faith. When we say the lightning
2459040	2464080	causes the flash, we're saying nothing at all there. We're simply taking an event that happened,
2464800	2472480	a series of sensations that we had, maybe it's sensations of a routinely repeated and even
2472480	2478240	scientifically understood phenomenon like lightning. But nevertheless, we're taking an event that
2478320	2483760	happened, which is inseparable from the process that creates that event. It's all the same thing,
2483760	2489440	one big process, one big happening, one big becoming. And we're distilling out of that,
2490000	2495920	a subject that does the thing. Further down in the passage Nietzsche continues quote,
2496960	2504480	all that happened was considered a doing, all doing the effect of a will. The world became to
2504480	2511920	it a multiplicity of doers, a doer, a subject was slipped under all that happened. It was out of
2511920	2518640	himself that man projected his three inner facts, that in which he believed most firmly, the will,
2518640	2525920	the spirit, the ego. He even took the concept of being from the concept of the ego, he posited
2525920	2533920	things as being as a cause, small wonder that later he always found in things only that which he had
2533920	2540960	put into them. The thing itself to say it once more, the concept of thing is a mere reflex of the
2540960	2549120	faith and the ego as a cause. And even your atom, my dear mechanists and physicists, how much error,
2549120	2554640	how much rudimentary psychology is still residual in your atom end quote.
2556480	2563280	So when we slip being beneath everything, that is the creation of the doer that does the deed,
2563280	2568800	the lightning that does the flashing. Nietzsche's suggestion here is that this is a kind of sly
2568800	2574480	trickery, it's like a magic trick, sliding the card that the audience member revealed to you
2574480	2580000	back under the deck, right? That's what we have done with all phenomena. All that is given about
2580000	2584560	a phenomena is sensation, that's all we know of the world, what is given to us by the senses.
2585360	2592000	And we are by no means justified in positing being on that basis. These sensations are caused by
2592000	2598960	definite separate things with their own essence, that is sort of the best I can do it, positing the
2598960	2605200	ordinary notion of being. But we create the sense through our language, through the creation of the
2605200	2612000	thing, the subject, the object. This relates to atomism because the atomist is trying to discover
2612000	2619120	in some sense, the smallest thing, the bedrock of physical existence, the smallest possible particle,
2619120	2624480	the smallest unit of matter. Because if we were to discover that, we could then say that something
2625600	2631040	is real, something is existent in the way a platonic form exists, the atom is this thing,
2631040	2637920	the atom is that enduring unity that we always indicate when we indicate being. And thus, whatever
2637920	2644160	you may think of atomism, Nietzsche's point here is that the same tendency to think of the world in
2644160	2652080	terms of being is the same psychological undergirding of that atomist project. Fundamentally, this is
2652080	2658960	the same thing that undergirds the Theists project. He's articulating the same faith when he makes
2658960	2665840	spirit the cause of reality. God is the cause of reality. And here that prejudice is articulated
2665840	2671520	in the same form as its origin, reality as caused by the will of a thinking subject.
2672480	2677920	That intuition of being a thing that thinks, that's the reason for this type of error,
2677920	2684160	slipping that thing-ness, that being underneath the ego itself. And so we may say that in the
2684160	2691520	second great error, Nietzsche has gone farther in critiquing causal thinking itself. The third error,
2691520	2698160	that of imaginary causes, may at first appear to be less of an attack on causality than, you know,
2698240	2703440	simply another misapplication of causality. But as we get into this third error, I think it will
2703440	2711200	become clear there is a even further critique, an even deeper critique here as well. The error of
2711200	2717760	imaginary causes is best exemplified by dreams. Nietzsche here, again, returns to musings, which
2717760	2722960	he first put to the page in human all too human, and which were later revisited by Freud in his
2722960	2728320	work The Interpretation of Dreams. It's a well-known phenomenon that dreamers will experience external
2728320	2735120	stimuli of some kind, such as a loud sound, light flickering on their eyes, or as is the case in
2735120	2740320	some of Freud's experiments being tickled with a feather while you sleep, and the dreamer will
2740320	2746160	incorporate that sensation into the logic of the dream. Nietzsche writes, quote,
2747040	2754560	A cause is slipped under a particular sensation. For example, one following a far off canon shot,
2755200	2761280	often a whole little novel in which the dreamer turns up as the protagonist. The sensation endures
2761280	2767360	meanwhile in a kind of resonance. It waits as it were until the causal instinct permits it to step
2767360	2774800	into the foreground, now no longer as a chance occurrence, but as meaning. The canon shot appears
2774800	2782160	in a causal mode, in an apparent reversal of time. What is really later, the motivation,
2782160	2789280	is experienced first, often with a hundred details which pass like lightning, and the shot follows.
2790080	2796240	What has happened? The representations which were produced by a certain state have been
2796240	2803280	misunderstood as its causes, end quote. So the interesting thing about the dreaming mind
2803280	2808560	is the way in which a sensation is represented to the dreaming subject as a cause of events which
2808560	2815680	are entirely scripted and represented by the mind alone, for the mind alone. That the events in the
2815680	2822000	dream are not in fact caused by the canon shot. The canon shot is simply incorporated as the cause
2822000	2826640	as an event with meaning. The representations that were produced according to the logic of the dream
2827200	2832000	come from the motivating drives, the entire cacophony of all the organs and impulses within the
2832000	2837440	dreamer. And dreams also have that funny way of playing with time, as we all know from the film
2837440	2843440	Inception for example, in which some sense impression the dreamer receives can persist,
2843440	2847840	resonate as Nietzsche says here, and then be explained after the fact by the dreaming mind.
2848800	2855440	Which Nietzsche is comparing to the way that we represent the world, our sense organs interact
2855440	2860240	with our mind in such a way as to produce a representation. The representation of course
2860240	2866960	comes after the initial stimulus, but Nietzsche says in the logic of the dream this is precisely
2866960	2872320	reversed, and where Nietzsche makes another radical claim, another challenge to the common sense
2872320	2879680	wisdom is in the following paragraph, quote, In fact, we do the same thing when awake. Most of
2879680	2886160	our general feelings, every kind of inhibition, pressure, tension, and explosion in the play
2886160	2891360	and counterplay of our organs, and particularly in the state of the nervous sympathicus,
2891920	2897680	excite our causal instinct. We want to have a reason for feeling this way or that,
2898400	2904960	for feeling bad, or feeling good. We are never satisfied merely to state the fact that we feel
2904960	2911520	this way or that, we admit this fact only, become conscious of it only, and we have furnished some
2911600	2918800	kind of motivation. Memory, which swings into action in such cases, unknown to us, brings up
2918800	2923760	earlier states of the same kind, together with the causal interpretations associated with them,
2924560	2932240	not their real causes, end quote. This I think is imminently relatable, because for one I think
2932240	2937840	it's fairly common, it's a fairly common experience that sometimes you just wake up and feel,
2938560	2944640	for lack of a more descriptive word, happy. You're just having a good day, and you can't even find
2944640	2949360	any particular reason for it. Or maybe you wake up in a bad mood, you know, you woke up in the
2949360	2954080	wrong side of the bed, as we say, and then a friend asks you, why are you in such a bad mood?
2954720	2961520	And then what happens? You begin to search for reasons, some sort of consciously experienced
2961520	2967200	or consciously articulated cause for why you're in a given mental state or in a given mood.
2968000	2972800	And the memory begins to present you with all these possibilities. Here's why you might feel
2972800	2977840	that way. And as Nietzsche coins the phrase, and beyond good and evil, there might not be such a
2977840	2984160	fine distinction between finding and inventing, Finden und Erfinden, as these words are in German.
2984720	2989040	There's not as much of a difference between that as those two things, as we would like to think.
2990000	2993840	Now it's worth noting that in some sense, one could make the argument that it's actually the
2993840	2999760	point of memory to give you answers to the question, why do I feel this way? Like specifically
2999760	3004480	answering that question, that's one of the main tasks of memory, because one of the main advantages
3004480	3010000	of being a remembering organism is that when something isn't working for us, we can course
3010000	3014960	correct, we can say, I feel bad all the time. What am I doing that's making me feel bad?
3015520	3021520	And that's an indisputably useful function of memory, because an animal with no self-consciousness
3021520	3027280	across time doesn't have access to that kind of self-awareness. It might know I feel bad in the
3027280	3032480	moment. But if you can't string moments together and bring to mind the fact I felt bad every
3032480	3038480	single day for a week now, then course correction becomes difficult, if not impossible. And so this
3038480	3045280	is the main use of memory is actually to ask that question. But this is where the Nietzschean
3045280	3050000	critique of our notions of truth, given the context that we are biological
3050640	3056560	creatures that were physiological creatures. This is where that comes into play, because then
3056560	3061840	there's sort of a difficult question that is raised in the wake of this. Does memory actually
3061840	3069120	establish a firm empirical foundation for positing causal relationships between external events and
3069120	3075680	how we feel? All memory can do is correlate together all the times I felt a certain way,
3075680	3080480	and then ask what events preceded that. But can we actually say with certainty that the events
3080480	3086800	that preceded the way we feel caused that feeling? And if we can't say that with certainty, which I
3086800	3091840	think would follow from Nietzsche's argument so far, then tracing over all our past memories will
3091840	3096880	actually not bring us closer to any sort of certainty. It will simply remind us of past
3096880	3102160	interpretations we've made, past conscious explanations that we've given to ourselves,
3102160	3107760	post hoc, as to why that we feel the way that we do. And if every one of those past interpretations
3107760	3113360	was just as erroneous as the one prior to it, this kind of mental habit actually gets us nowhere.
3114560	3119520	The truth for Nietzsche is that there's this whole interplay of forces in our physiology,
3120160	3124880	that blind contest of impulses and drives. This is, in truth, why we feel the way we do.
3125520	3129840	But because none of those causal factors are actually conscious to us, none of them are freely
3129840	3137760	chosen to say this, to bring this to our attention, as Nietzsche does, as the equivalent of saying,
3138320	3144720	well, you simply feel this way, and that is that. But that's not satisfying, right?
3145920	3152800	That explanation, or frankly, that non-explanation, is not satisfying. And why? Well, Nietzsche says
3152800	3157200	there's a psychological explanation for why it's not satisfying, and it's fairly simple.
3157840	3163120	To locate a cause is to make known the unknown, and this quote relieves
3163120	3169520	comforts and satisfies, besides giving a feeling of power, end quote. When we're confronted by
3169520	3175280	an event beyond our control or understanding, the least we can do in order to not feel overwhelmed
3175280	3181280	by this is to explain why it is the event is happening, to give the event a meaning. Simply put,
3181280	3187040	to remain in a situation in which we're surrounded by the unknown is terrifying,
3187040	3192320	and the mind starts to grab for a cause in order to abolish the sense of terror,
3192320	3198080	like sort of grasping at vines to claw our way out of that pit, right? And so Nietzsche writes,
3198800	3206480	quote, first principle, any explanation is better than none. Since at bottom, it is merely a matter
3206480	3212320	of wishing to be rid of oppressive representations, one is not too particular about the means of
3212320	3218880	getting rid of them. The first representation that explains the unknown as familiar feels so good
3218880	3226560	that one quote considers it true, the proof of pleasure, of strength, as a criterion of truth,
3227680	3234480	end quote. We return to that old bad habit in drawing conclusions that Nietzsche wrote about
3234480	3239200	way back in human all too human, the proof by pleasure, believe this because it feels good,
3239920	3244720	in this case, because it abolishes that which feels bad, the sense of the unknown.
3245680	3250240	It doesn't even have to be a good explanation, any explanation that delivers us from the fear of
3250240	3257120	the unknown. The first one that seems to work as a cause, we will pick that explanation as soon
3257120	3263840	as possible, so that we can stop thinking about it. Nietzsche goes on to say, of course,
3263840	3269520	that we will adopt familiar causes over anything strange, over anything never experienced before.
3270320	3274720	Whatever we have already inscribed into memory and labeled as a cause will be our go to,
3275760	3280320	and memory will habituate this kind of thinking as a heuristic for future encounters with the
3280320	3287360	unknown. The lingering doubt, the mysterious, the unexplained, this is in many ways a torment,
3288000	3293120	causal thinking is a delivery from that torment, but that doesn't make it true, it just makes it
3293120	3298480	pleasurable. See, this is the the radical critique that Nietzsche is giving us about the structure
3298480	3305360	of our thought. Why we think the things that we do, as Deleuze would put it, truth is not an
3305360	3311360	element of thought. Nietzsche here is saying pleasure is the use of familiar habitual thought
3311360	3316960	patterns is pleasurable, which is why once this error in thought seeps into our thinking, we just
3316960	3322880	continue in it insensibly. There's a dimension of this in our own individual psychology as well,
3323520	3329920	Nietzsche writes, quote, one kind of positing of causes predominates more and more, is concentrated
3329920	3336560	into a system and finally emerges as dominant, that is, as simply precluding other causes and
3336560	3344800	explanations. The banker immediately thinks of business, the Christian of sin, and the girl
3344800	3352560	of her love, end quote. This kind of habituated thought pattern is a common error all its own,
3353280	3360000	albeit only a subset of this great error. But we've all seen it, I'm sure, the political activist for
3360000	3366320	whom the cause of everything in life is political, whatever the problem is, that was because of the
3366320	3371360	politics of the other side, whatever the solution is, or whatever good thing we have going on in
3371360	3376400	society, that's because of the politics of my side, every single problem is considered politically,
3376400	3381680	everything is assumed to be the result of this one system of causes, which is dominant in their
3381680	3388560	thought, and so they ignore all the other causes. Or we might think of the paranoiac, the person who's
3388560	3394240	dominated by paranoid suspicions and fears. They have an internal problem, they have their own
3394240	3400320	pathology, their own excessive blood of fearful and suspicious feelings, but they find the causes
3400320	3406640	of those feelings projected onto the external world. I'm fearful and suspicious not because I'm
3406640	3411760	paranoid, but because I'm being followed, right? Anything that happens in such a person's life
3411760	3418480	can be explained by some malevolent external force, some person that they're suspicious of,
3418480	3425600	and on and on. Carl Jung's notion that everything within the psyche that remains unconscious becomes
3425600	3431440	projected onto the world, and seen as a sort of external force or external actor, that idea
3431440	3436640	bears mentioning here because it resembles Nietzsche's idea in this passage. Everything
3436640	3443440	beneath the surface of consciousness is worked into the same familiar framework and projected onto
3443440	3450080	an external cause. Nietzsche goes on to argue that, quote, the whole realm of morality and religion
3450080	3456480	belongs under this concept of imaginary causes, end quote. And what Nietzsche means by this is
3456480	3462240	quite clear when we look at the concept of sin. How would Nietzsche regard sin, given the critiques
3462240	3469040	he's made so far about our causal thinking, our misapplications of causality? Well, he says the
3469040	3476080	feeling of sin is, quote, slipped under a physiological discomfort. One always finds reasons
3476080	3484160	for being dissatisfied with oneself, end quote. This kind of critique harkens back to the genealogy
3484160	3492480	of morals, in which Nietzsche says that the priest tells his flock, you sickly sheep, you are to blame
3492480	3499120	for your own suffering. Nietzsche wonders in that work how it is that such a sick ideology,
3499120	3505760	such as the ascetic ideal, could ever take hold. And this third great error is one of the elements
3505760	3511920	of that. The dismal workshop of the psyche that Christianity establishes, in which guilt is actually
3511920	3517760	heightened, the individuals made to work at making himself feel guiltier and guiltier.
3518400	3522400	This workshop gets going with the fuel of Rosentum all directed by the priest,
3523040	3530320	but its operations follow the formula as laid out here in the error of imaginary causes. That is
3530320	3536880	its structure. That is to say that the individual suffers and without an explanation feels his
3536880	3543280	suffering to be meaningless. It's part of the unknown, right? The discomfort of the unknown is
3543280	3548160	a thousand times more painful than the suffering itself, the sense that one's enduring a kind
3548160	3554880	of meaningless suffering. The priest gives the parishioner suffering meaning, that is his great
3554880	3560000	benefaction to mankind in a way, that he can make their suffering meaningful, and thus eases the
3560000	3566160	pain of suffering by attributing it to a cause. Now the entire mechanism of this, in Nietzsche's
3566160	3571520	view, is very bad because it multiplies the suffering in order to deal with the suffering.
3572080	3576560	But that's neither here nor there for our purposes in analyzing this passage. The key point
3576560	3580240	is that by giving the suffering meaning, the priest is engaging in this thinking based on
3580240	3586160	imaginary causes, and that it's better to have this imaginary cause than no cause at all.
3587280	3591600	Nietzsche finds that this prejudice is right there in the work of, for example, Schopenhauer,
3592160	3598400	his once great influence whom he later rejected. Nietzsche quotes world as well in representation,
3598400	3605360	quote, every great pain, whether physical or spiritual, declares what we deserve, for it could
3605360	3612560	not come to us if we did not deserve it, end quote. Nietzsche criticized this aspect of Schopenhauer's
3612560	3617200	thinking, once again in human all to human, where he said that we tend to think that because a
3617200	3623440	sensation exists, there must be some justification for it. The word deserve in Schopenhauer
3624240	3629840	is really an attempt to legitimize or justify suffering. Why? Well, in order to give it that
3629840	3634720	much needed meaning. What does it mean for suffering to be deserved? Well, it means there
3634720	3639360	was some way that it could have been prevented, some way of acting or being that we did not
3639360	3645440	properly fulfill. And as a result, we must suffer. And Nietzsche argues that reveals the truth of
3645440	3653040	morality as a poisoner and slanderer of life that it is. Morality always has this idea behind it,
3653600	3659280	of treating the suffering of life as a punishment for wrong action. Meanwhile, good feelings,
3659280	3664800	good conscience, happiness, that's all conceived as the reward for the consciousness having done
3664800	3671760	good deeds, of having acted the proper way. You used your will to obey the laws of God and so on.
3671760	3676320	And so good feelings are the reward for right action, bad feelings are the punishment for wrong
3676320	3684480	action. You know, again, the pleasure in these ideas is in giving a meaning to the entire human
3684480	3691040	psychodrama of feelings and sensations. Nietzsche raises an issue with this as well, though. He
3691040	3697360	writes that the so-called good conscience is, quote, a physiological state, which at times
3697360	3703520	looks so much like good digestion that it is hard to tell them apart, end quote. In other words,
3703520	3708560	the reason you're in a good mood is probably because you had a good wholesome meal and no indigestion
3708560	3714400	while metabolizing it. You say the cause of your happiness is your virtuous deeds. Nietzsche says
3714400	3720960	the cause of your happiness is your gut. He also takes issue with what he calls a naïve fallacy,
3720960	3727120	that happiness comes from the successful completion of some enterprise. That in other words, you
3727120	3733680	know, we reach a goal that we've we've long tried to attain. You complete some meaningful task or
3733680	3738800	project and that's what makes you happy. Nietzsche says, quote, the successful termination of some
3738800	3745280	enterprise does not by any means give a hypochondriac or a Pascal agreeable feelings, end quote.
3746400	3754320	So to use the example of Blaise Pascal, it seems quite probable to me that Pascal was never happy
3755280	3761520	or rarely if ever happy might be a more measured way for me to put it. Pascal was an extreme depressive.
3761520	3766000	You know, he writes extensively about just how horrible it would be if it turned out that the
3766000	3771760	only existence were this world, you know, this world of impermanence and suffering, right? That
3771760	3777680	the human condition is like being one of many chained prisoners simply awaiting our execution.
3778320	3783600	That we're like a mode of dust in a chaotic universe whose scale is just beyond any comprehension.
3783600	3788720	These kinds of terrifying existential thoughts are always sort of storming through Pascal's mind
3789360	3795440	and they don't go away when he completes some task or personal challenge. They don't go away when he
3796560	3801280	you know, achieves his salvation of his soul through Christianity. So he believes, right?
3803200	3808800	If anything, these feelings are heightened now when Pascal becomes a Christian because he begins
3808800	3814880	to fear for his own salvation and he writes that salvation is uncertain even for the martyrs
3815520	3821200	up until the time when you face, you know, the justice of God or so on and so forth, whether
3821200	3826320	or not you find out that God will extend his grace to you. We might say the example of the
3826320	3832160	hypochondriac is also instructive here, you know, types with sustained high anxiety.
3833120	3839200	The actual circumstances of their lives don't matter that much in terms of regulating the state.
3839840	3843760	You know, their brains just always invent some reason why they need to be freaking out because
3843760	3848480	there's always at least some possibility that you ought to be freaking out. You know, there's always
3849280	3854160	could be some medical reason lurking within your physiology that you haven't become aware of yet.
3854160	3858720	You can always come up with something if your brain is dead set on worrying.
3859680	3864880	And so again, attributing the cause of your worrying to some definite event or external force
3865680	3870880	is an imaginary cause. And that becomes very obvious with such terminally anxious people
3871520	3875440	that they simply have something wrong, something that's malfunctioning with their brain that's
3875440	3881040	making them anxious. And then in fact, the searching for the imaginary causes of their anxiety is
3881040	3886960	actually part of the anxiety. It's actually part of that anxious brain cycle. You know,
3887040	3893120	similarly to with depression, depressed people aren't sad all the time, because every single
3893120	3899840	day of their lives is a never ending tragedy of just horrible calamitous things. It's because
3899840	3904400	they're incapable of being happy. That doesn't mean that that situation can't change by the way.
3904400	3907760	I'm not saying you're doomed to depression forever. That's not what I'm saying at all by the way.
3909760	3914000	I'm not saying there isn't a solution for their depression. It just means that blaming
3914080	3919120	external circumstances for a repeated sustained feeling that's happening inside of your head.
3919760	3925600	That is rather obviously a mistake. And it's actually part of that whole pathology is to
3925600	3933040	make those projections. Nietzsche writes, quote, in truth, all these supposed explanations are
3933040	3938720	resultant states. And as it were, translations of pleasurable or unpleasurable feelings into a
3938720	3945040	false dialect. One is in a state of hope because the basic physiological feeling is once again
3945040	3951200	strong and rich. One trusts in God because the feeling of fullness and strength gives a sense
3951200	3958480	of rest. Morality and religion belong altogether to the psychology of error. In every single case,
3958480	3963280	cause and effect are confused. Or truth is confused with the effects of believing something to be
3963280	3971920	true. Or a state of consciousness is confused with its causes. End quote. And so at this point,
3971920	3979280	we arrive at the final great error. Free will. In many ways, free will exemplifies all of these
3979280	3984480	errors and thought that we've previously considered. But Nietzsche lists it as a special case. And I
3984480	3990880	think because from free will, we can infer what it is that sets this entire erroneous thought
3990880	3996800	process into motion. The germ of the idea of free will Nietzsche alleges comes from what he calls
3997360	4002640	the foulest of all the theologians, artifices. So the worst thing that the religious thinkers
4002640	4009360	have ever created. This is the notion of responsibility, which makes the subject dependent
4009360	4015440	on the religious caste. This is because responsibility is what sits at the foundations of
4015440	4020800	all morality. This is what we have been articulating throughout this examination when it comes to
4020800	4026080	the tendencies of all moralities and religions to promise happiness in exchange for quote unquote
4026080	4033120	good behavior, and to promise punishment as the wages of sin. Responsibility is the concept required
4033120	4038560	for all moralism, without which the moral interpretation of human life just simply falls
4038560	4044720	apart. And why do we consider human beings responsible? Why are we responsible for our
4044720	4052480	actions or for our will? This is because of the belief in the doctrine of free will free will
4052480	4057520	responsibility. These concepts are more or less the same thing. We might ask a simple question
4057520	4064560	therefore. Why seek responsibility? Why would we create such a concept assuming that it is
4064560	4072560	false as Nietzsche says? Why would we have this notion then quote, wherever responsibilities are
4072640	4078800	sought? It is usually the instinct of wanting to judge and punish, which is at work. Becoming has
4078800	4085200	been deprived of its innocence when any being such and such is traced back to will to purposes,
4085200	4091600	to acts of responsibility. The doctrine of the will has been invented essentially for the purpose
4091600	4098560	of punishment. That is because one wanted to impute guilt. The entire old psychology, the psychology
4098560	4104240	of will, was conditioned by the fact that its originators, the priests at the head of ancient
4104240	4109680	communities, wanted to create for themselves the right to punish, or wanted to create this right
4109680	4116720	for God. Men were considered free so that they might be judged and punished, so that they might
4116720	4123440	become guilty. Consequently, every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every
4123440	4130320	act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness end quote. So this passage is
4130320	4135760	important in light of the fact that Nietzsche has attempted to make sense of human life with what he
4135760	4142480	calls an economy of principles. That is to say the greatest possible explanatory power excuse me
4142480	4147520	in the fewest possible principles. If human life is to be understood naturalistically then where
4147600	4153680	do we get the notion of free will? Here as elsewhere Nietzsche says the answer is will to power.
4154400	4161040	The priestly class, the ascetic types, they create free will, they create moral responsibility
4161040	4165840	because it's a means of wielding power. It makes the individuals of the community responsible,
4166560	4172560	and not just responsible in some sort of abstract sense, responsible to the priest,
4173120	4178960	who is the intercessor between man and God. If man thinks that there is right action and wrong
4178960	4183120	action, and that he's morally responsible for choosing right action over wrong,
4184000	4189200	he will naturally ask the priest, how should I act? And if he's asked, uh,
4189200	4193520	actioned wrongly in the past, he'll go to the priest and ask to be absolved.
4194640	4200640	The priest attained power over the flock by making them guilty. As Nietzsche writes further down in
4200640	4208560	the passage, quote, Christianity is a metaphysics of the hangman end quote. That is the aim of this
4208560	4214720	doctrine of responsibility, which is substantially identical with the doctrine of free will. And
4214720	4220160	Nietzsche writes that the priests and theologians continue to infect becoming, which is nature in
4220160	4225760	its pure innocence, with this guilt, that this is in some sense the ugliest thing that the human
4225760	4232320	animal does, and that the human animal does uniquely. It introduces guilt into innocent nature, innocent
4232320	4239920	becoming. To Nietzsche, therefore, free will is not simply a doctrine that expresses a common
4239920	4247280	sense truth about the world. It was a weed that was planted in us all for a very specific purpose.
4248320	4254080	And perhaps all such ideas, all such beliefs are planted for a similar such purpose to motivate
4254080	4259600	a certain kind of behavior, to express the power of a given drive within mankind.
4260800	4265680	This doctrine of responsibility, if we examine it in light of a naturalistic understanding of the
4265680	4270320	world, is a strange and unique thing. It doesn't really fit with the rest of our comprehension
4270320	4276480	of nature, where we never perceive, we never look for responsibility. We don't see responsibility
4276480	4282160	in the cosmos and the orbiting bodies slamming into one another or flying off into the abysses of
4282160	4288480	space. The one place that we find it is in ourselves, due to what we call these inner facts,
4289120	4295600	actually, conscience, or an intuition that has been inculcated in us and nurtured.
4296560	4301440	If we examine the doctrine strictly on a logical basis, we find it's premised on great
4301440	4307760	leaps of logical supposition, which designate the will as a causal force, the ego as the cause of
4307760	4315840	the will, and the ego one's self-nature as an uncaused cause, for which one becomes responsible
4315840	4323200	for themselves, that is, as if one had created himself and decided his own nature. This is a
4323200	4328160	series of fallacious assumptions, which we're not at all permitted to make according to the facts
4328160	4334400	at hand. It's nothing but an interpretation based on the attribution of imaginary causes,
4335120	4339040	taking something that merely accompanies the event as the cause of the event,
4339680	4345200	and nature, as he says, is an immoralist who's trying with all his strength to, quote,
4345760	4350880	take the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment out of the world again,
4351600	4358000	and to cleanse psychology, history, nature, and social institutions, end quote.
4359600	4363840	As this is his goal, he must necessarily oppose himself to the doctrine of free will,
4364480	4369600	which is the origin of that stain on the self-consciousness of nature, which is
4370560	4377840	man. The last section of this chapter, the four great errors, section eight, we can regard as
4377840	4383760	Nietzsche's mission statement, so to speak. If all of these apparently self-evident beliefs are
4383760	4389760	in fact errors, then what doctrine ought we take up instead? And he directly contrasts himself
4389760	4395520	with the positions of Kant and Schopenhauer, who both question free will on a strictly logical basis,
4396080	4402800	but appeal to two things, our intuition of free will, i.e., the way we think about ourselves
4402800	4408480	and think about our actions, regardless of the truth of those thoughts, and also to the notion
4408480	4414800	of intelligible freedom, that in spite of the fact that we act in one way or another
4415600	4421120	in accord with our own nature, meaning that apparently we simply are one way or another,
4422080	4427840	man must have had a freedom to be this or that kind of person. There must be some kind of choice
4428800	4433840	prior to the realization of one's nature. And Nietzsche implies that this is because we've
4433840	4438800	always held a more basic and blatantly false prejudice, but one which nevertheless colors
4438800	4445040	our thinking, that man is the effect of some special purpose or some special destiny.
4446080	4449840	This kind of thinking is right in line with our entire concept of being,
4449840	4454880	which draws these lines of separation between subject and object, between cause and effect,
4454880	4460880	between one phenomena and another. That man is divided from the rest of nature as a special
4460880	4467040	quote-unquote thing, a special case, something capable of attaining the ideal of humanity,
4467040	4472160	the ideal of happiness, the ideal of morality. But Nietzsche argues, quote,
4472800	4479680	the fatality of his essence is not to be disentangled from the fatality of all that has been and will
4479680	4487200	be, end quote. The counter doctrine then to free will and to the entire doctrine of causality,
4487200	4494880	which includes even the refutation of free will, the doctrine of determinism, all of this is to be
4494880	4501360	dismissed in the face of Nietzsche's new doctrine of fate. This is why I tend to call Nietzsche's view
4501360	4508720	fatalism, in which all apparently separate things and events are part of a vast tapestry. And this
4508720	4514480	isn't like a mechanistic series of billiard balls clacking into one after the other in a chain of
4514480	4520080	causes and effects that must either end in the absurdity of an infinite regress or the equal
4520160	4526320	absurdity of an uncaused cause. We might say, by the way, the infinite regress absurdity is found
4526320	4532160	in determinism, and the uncaused cause absurdity is found in the libertarian free will doctrine.
4532960	4538640	That is what the debate is between. No, Nietzsche is not having any of this, because to even create
4538640	4546000	that image of existence as a chain, a series of links, is to draw arbitrary divisions to,
4546000	4551200	from our human perspective, which informs us not one bit about the nature of human independent
4551200	4556400	reality, create all of these separate categories and then call them beings or existence or causes
4556400	4562640	and effects. And in this way, Nietzsche rebukes Kant while retaining his influence from the neocontians,
4562640	4566640	which is with Nietzsche all the way from the beginning of his career. He carries forward
4566640	4573280	that intuition that causality is not something, quote unquote, out there in an objective world.
4574080	4581920	It's something which happens at the intersection of human perception and the so-called external
4581920	4587120	world, something that is useful for us as an interpretive framework, even though it may be
4587120	4592800	a false framework for all that. We'll now look at the final paragraph of the chapter,
4592800	4600400	the conclusion of the four great errors, quote. One is necessary. One is a piece of faithfulness.
4600960	4606880	One belongs to the whole. One is in the whole. There is nothing which could judge, measure,
4606880	4611520	compare, or sentence our being, for that would mean judging, measuring, comparing,
4611520	4617440	or sentencing the whole. But there is nothing besides the whole, that nobody is held responsible
4617440	4622720	any longer, that the mode of being may not be traced back to a cause of prima, that the world
4622720	4629600	does not form a unity either as a sensorium or as a spirit. That alone is the great liberation.
4629600	4636400	With this alone is the innocence of becoming restored. The concept of God was until now the
4636400	4644000	greatest objection to existence. We deny God. We deny the responsibility in God. Only thereby do
4644000	4652000	we redeem the world, end quote. To want one aspect of fate to be different is to want the whole
4652000	4656880	thing to be different. The entire interplay of forces would be altered by one force disappearing,
4657520	4662880	changing its course or intensity. And yet reality is not to be conceived as a unity,
4662880	4668080	as a monism, and the way that, say, many of the early pre-platonics thought that reality could
4668080	4674240	be conceived. No, Nietzsche is with the pluralists, and he's with Heraclitus. The one is the many.
4674800	4680400	The many is not reducible to a one, but neither is any part of the many to be conceived as a
4680400	4687520	cause unto itself divided ontologically from the rest of the many. The many remains a many,
4687520	4693120	not the subject divided from the world of objects. Nietzsche's fatalism therefore
4693120	4700240	dares us to accept a pluralistic reality, and every event within it, as absolutely necessitated
4700240	4706240	by a non-purposive relation of forces. If we take that great leap of acceptance,
4706960	4713040	of regarding every piece of fate as necessary, we affirm the entirety of the great play of
4713040	4719360	becoming. And if one does this, then imputing guilt or responsibilities to some portion of it
4719920	4724800	would be just another absurdity. Because every other part which we affirm and call good can only
4724800	4730240	exist in relation to those parts that we call bad. That we are to say, along with Spinoza,
4730800	4737520	that the many modifications of existence, the various phenomena, meaning animals, trees, mountains,
4738080	4745520	lightning, flash floods, human beings, warfare, disease, weather patterns, all of it, can only
4745520	4752720	be regarded as good or bad from the standpoint of our limited human reason, from the standpoint of
4752720	4759120	one particular perspective. None of it is good or bad in and of itself. Because to say that would
4759120	4765280	be to deny the whole the right of existence. In Nietzsche's eyes, this is the effect of the
4765280	4771680	God doctrine, the idea of an eternal moral judge presiding over all being. Being instantiated in
4771680	4777920	our thought has an eternally existing form of consciousness, and in eternal moral law, which
4777920	4784240	intercedes in existence, judges and condemns some, affirms and uplifts others, divides all the souls
4784240	4790720	at the end of time into the good people and the bad people. This is not a healthy view of existence.
4790720	4796400	It's an argument against existence, in fact, because it necessitates, as it were, a judgment
4796400	4802640	passed against the world. If this world of nature and the people living in it, its states and empires,
4802640	4808880	are to be judged from the absolute moral standard of Christianity, then the world must be deemed guilty.
4809440	4816400	But we already know where this drive to call the world guilty comes from. Nietzsche suggests
4816400	4822080	that this is where we should look to determine why it is that we would make such errors as those that
4822080	4828960	we have considered. Once again, under our apparently cool-headed rationalist view of the world,
4829840	4836320	we find what is ultimately religious. And that is true, even of those of us
4837200	4844240	who have formally left religion. These great errors still remain in our thought.
4846320	4852080	That's all for this week, everyone. Thanks for joining me. I'm back at home from after being on
4852080	4857760	tour. I was sick for a while. I don't know if you can hear it in my voice, maybe it gives my voice
4857760	4864240	a little more roughness or grit, but I'm getting better. I'm improving. As many of you know,
4864240	4868160	if you've been listening for a while, you usually get sick when you're on tour like that.
4868880	4875040	But we've got four more episodes of this season coming out. I'm excited for every one of these.
4875040	4879600	I think these are going to be really good. I'm happy with them regardless of what the
4879600	4885280	reception is going to be, but I think it's going to be pretty good. Alright, that's all. Signing off.
