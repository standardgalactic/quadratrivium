WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
I accept the matter of the whole world at the beginning as in a state of general dispersion

00:09.000 --> 00:12.520
and make of it a complete chaos.

00:12.520 --> 00:19.200
I see this matter forming itself in accordance with the established laws of attraction and

00:19.200 --> 00:22.320
modifying its movement by repulsion.

00:22.320 --> 00:29.120
I enjoy the pleasure, without having recourse to arbitrary hypotheses of seeing a well-ordered

00:29.120 --> 00:35.680
whole produced under the regulation of the established laws of motion, and this whole

00:35.680 --> 00:41.560
looks so like that system of the world before our eyes that I cannot refuse to identify

00:41.560 --> 00:43.400
it with it.

00:43.400 --> 00:50.360
I will therefore not deny that the theory of Lucretius, or his predecessors, Epicurus,

00:50.360 --> 00:56.080
Lusapus, and Democritus, has much resemblance with mine.

00:56.080 --> 01:04.040
It seems to me that we can hearsay with intelligent certainty and without audacity, give me matter

01:04.040 --> 01:10.720
and I will construct a world out of it."

01:10.720 --> 01:18.720
That's Emanuel Kant from his Natural History of the Heavens, and that particular section

01:18.720 --> 01:24.600
is quoted by Friedrich Nietzsche in his lectures on the pre-plotonic philosophers.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.920
What we see in this quotation from Kant is an enthusiasm for science and for the explanatory

01:30.920 --> 01:33.680
power of the scientific method.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.800
Kant here sees his forerunners all the way back in the philosophers before Plato and

01:38.800 --> 01:44.600
Socrates, referencing Democritus, the father of atomism.

01:44.600 --> 01:50.520
Kant recognizes a resemblance in their theories, but also a common spirit, a common goal or

01:50.520 --> 01:56.860
quest, not just a praise of science for its ability to answer individual empirical questions,

01:56.860 --> 01:59.680
but to construct a world.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.840
And there is a beauty to Kant's expression here.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.720
That one could begin with a few starting principles, laws of motion and dispersion as

02:07.720 --> 02:13.800
he calls them, general patterns or properties of how matter behaves, and then from these

02:13.800 --> 02:23.160
starting parameters come to gain a coherent understanding of the immeasurably complex

02:23.160 --> 02:25.080
reality that we live in.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.840
For Kant, this is the allure of science.

02:28.840 --> 02:33.880
And so I want to pose the question to all of us, what is the point of science?

02:33.880 --> 02:38.880
It may seem like a strange question for us to ask today, but I think it's worth reflecting

02:38.880 --> 02:44.840
on because, I mean, first of all, it seems obvious that we should be able to answer it.

02:44.840 --> 02:50.760
But secondly, it's not a question that science itself can't answer, at least science the

02:50.760 --> 02:56.100
way that we understand it today, and this is because it's a question of values.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.780
Why do we value science?

02:57.780 --> 03:00.640
Why do we pursue scientific knowledge?

03:00.640 --> 03:05.440
Admittedly, I don't think that for most of us these questions are all that difficult

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
to answer.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.120
But let's take the question seriously and assume for the sake of argument that it really

03:10.120 --> 03:14.800
matters what our answer is, and whether we have the right answer.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.080
And of course, we'll find that not everyone has the same answer, which is a problem in

03:19.080 --> 03:20.560
and of itself.

03:20.560 --> 03:25.520
Furthermore, the framework on which one should base their answer is not obvious either.

03:25.520 --> 03:30.600
I mean, suppose we appeal to what might be the commonplace view that science is valuable

03:30.600 --> 03:35.160
because of its utility, science gives us power over the world.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.840
Or suppose we appeal to the more philosophical view that science is worth pursuing because

03:39.840 --> 03:45.880
truth is valuable in and of itself, and science helps us gain knowledge and more importantly

03:45.880 --> 03:49.600
to falsify incorrect knowledge so it gets us closer to the truth.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.080
Science is good because truth is good, right?

03:52.080 --> 03:56.480
And science is the best way of verifying or falsifying truth statements.

03:56.480 --> 04:01.360
Or maybe we take an older view, the view of Kant, as I quoted from him at the beginning,

04:01.360 --> 04:07.440
that science is part of a broader project of human knowledge, attempting to gain a complete

04:07.440 --> 04:11.320
rational understanding of the world around them.

04:11.320 --> 04:16.440
You could find positives or negatives to each of those descriptions of what science is or

04:16.440 --> 04:20.880
what the value of science is, and have arguments for or against.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.120
But ultimately, my point in bringing this up is that we would have to conclude that when

04:24.120 --> 04:29.840
it comes to questions of values, we have no definitive means of settling these questions.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.680
We know scientific means.

04:31.680 --> 04:37.160
And so this takes us into territory that we might call metascience, or a discussion of

04:37.160 --> 04:39.680
the philosophy of science.

04:39.680 --> 04:46.320
And so today, we're going to take a look at Nietzsche's philosophy of science and the

04:46.320 --> 04:52.960
great influence on his philosophy of science that he derives from Friedrich Albert Lange.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.680
Now, philosophy of science is not something that Friedrich Nietzsche is usually associated

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
with.

04:58.680 --> 05:04.960
It's not uncommon to encounter caricatures of Nietzsche as an irrationalist, or to see

05:04.960 --> 05:10.940
the interpretations of his philosophy, which emphasize the postmodern aspects, the elements

05:10.940 --> 05:17.200
of Nietzsche's thought that sort of emphasize the role of interpretation, or cleave to like

05:17.200 --> 05:18.800
a pure perspectivism.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.720
Now, of course, Nietzsche himself is somewhat responsible for that.

05:22.720 --> 05:29.000
And so far as he writes of the problem of science, the problem of Socrates, the danger

05:29.000 --> 05:37.040
that an excess of rational discursive intellect will pose, the danger that it will damage

05:37.040 --> 05:38.960
life's beautiful illusions.

05:38.960 --> 05:43.400
There are many variations on this type of presentation of Nietzsche, and I've given

05:43.400 --> 05:47.680
this presentation of his ideas myself here.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.240
And so that is to say, it's not wrong.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.280
This kind of presentation of Nietzsche has its place.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.720
But we must ask, does Nietzsche have a philosophy of science?

05:57.720 --> 06:03.120
And what one finds, if they search for it in his work, is that indeed he does.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.640
And perhaps the most interesting aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy of science is how it

06:07.640 --> 06:11.640
developed and what it culminates in.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.440
Because what we find when we take a closer look at this question of the Nietzschean philosophy

06:16.440 --> 06:22.520
of science is that it is a secret beginning to Nietzsche's philosophizing.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.680
That is, as Annie Anders and Carl Schlechter, who was in charge of the Nietzsche Archive

06:27.680 --> 06:33.240
for many years, the two of them have called it, that the secret origins of Nietzsche first

06:33.240 --> 06:39.160
thinking philosophically originate with his development of an understanding of the nature

06:39.160 --> 06:44.560
of what science is, the point of science, and how science develops.

06:44.560 --> 06:50.520
During his early days as a philologist, Nietzsche read and studied the pre-Socratic philosophers

06:50.520 --> 06:54.800
or, as he called them, the pre-Platonics.

06:54.800 --> 07:02.640
Figures like Anaximander, Heraclitus, Democritus, he also became familiar with philosophers

07:02.640 --> 07:08.800
of science, including Neocontian figures, some of whom were scientists themselves, such

07:08.800 --> 07:14.120
as Launga, Helmholtz, Von Baer, and others.

07:14.120 --> 07:18.560
And finally, many of those that we count among the great philosophers today are scientists

07:18.560 --> 07:19.560
as well.

07:19.560 --> 07:26.360
It had important things to say about the philosophy of science, people like Leibniz and Spinoza,

07:26.360 --> 07:29.320
Kant, even Schopenhauer.

07:29.320 --> 07:33.320
Because of course, Nietzsche did not drop out of the ether.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.000
He's not a unique figure with no precedent.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.320
There are many things that are unique or peculiar to Nietzsche, but like all the other philosophers,

07:42.320 --> 07:47.520
he's engaged in a dialogue with the ideas of past thinkers, and his entry to the dialogue

07:47.520 --> 07:53.960
is in direct response to disputes within 19th century science, and about the philosophy

07:53.960 --> 07:55.600
of science.

07:55.600 --> 08:01.080
And so now you may think, what is the use in understanding 19th century science and

08:01.080 --> 08:03.160
earlier views of science?

08:03.160 --> 08:08.080
Like why familiarize ourselves with the ideas of Launga, or the theories of Spinoza, or

08:08.080 --> 08:11.160
the mathematics of Poskovich, right?

08:11.160 --> 08:18.280
These kinds of questions are why, I think, many of us avoid engaging with Nietzsche in

08:18.280 --> 08:20.560
this way, right?

08:20.560 --> 08:26.320
On the basis of what he thought about science and his philosophy of science, because inevitably

08:26.320 --> 08:28.960
it seems outdated or irrelevant.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.720
If you want to understand physics, pick up a modern physics textbook, right?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.520
You don't go to Friedrich Nietzsche.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.000
But in my view, understanding these things is very relevant, actually.

08:40.040 --> 08:44.440
Let's take a step back and consider what we'd like to get out of this.

08:44.440 --> 08:48.960
The questions we're entertaining now are not properly scientific, as we've said, but rather

08:48.960 --> 08:54.080
meta-scientific, addressed to the questions of the philosophy of science, and so is the

08:54.080 --> 08:57.920
goal of science to give us a true picture of the world.

08:57.920 --> 09:02.360
Do insights gained through empirical data and the scientific method indicate anything

09:02.360 --> 09:05.680
to us about the fundamental nature of the world?

09:05.680 --> 09:10.320
If there are patterns and laws that govern reality, can we distill those patterns and

09:10.320 --> 09:18.360
laws down to as few principles as possible, or is it possible to even have a single principle?

09:18.360 --> 09:21.720
What is the relationship of science to metaphysics?

09:21.720 --> 09:25.160
Does science require a metaphysics in order to pursue the truth?

09:25.160 --> 09:30.040
In other words, if we have no theory of what the data from sense perceptions indicates,

09:30.040 --> 09:34.200
no understanding of what an individual fact of reality corresponds to, you know, in the

09:34.200 --> 09:37.720
grand totality of things, then do we really understand anything?

09:37.720 --> 09:43.120
I might have a really sophisticated knowledge of the turning of the seasons, for example,

09:43.120 --> 09:49.920
as many ancient people did, or even potentially people before the dawn of civilization.

09:49.920 --> 09:55.200
But to what extent did they really have that much of a greater understanding of the world,

09:55.200 --> 09:59.440
just by virtue of this fact, over somebody who didn't know of the turning of the seasons,

09:59.560 --> 10:05.520
because it still contains so much personified things that they saw in nature and mythological

10:05.520 --> 10:06.520
knowledge.

10:06.520 --> 10:10.240
I mean, given that they didn't understand the turning of the seasons in context to be

10:10.240 --> 10:15.880
a phenomenon caused by Earth's axial tilt of its orbit around the sun, right?

10:15.880 --> 10:19.680
So is science just the pursuit of a bunch of disconnected facts, or is our ultimate goal

10:19.680 --> 10:24.600
to correlate all these facts into a coherent understanding that counts for all of those

10:24.600 --> 10:26.240
facts, right?

10:26.240 --> 10:32.080
And it's difficult to say that discovering the true nature of reality, however you want

10:32.080 --> 10:37.120
to describe what I just said there, it's difficult to say that that's the point of any one application

10:37.120 --> 10:40.720
of the scientific method in the form of an experiment.

10:40.720 --> 10:46.000
But if we don't ask the question of what we're doing when we do science generally, I think

10:46.000 --> 10:49.840
we find ourselves in a very strange place where we have no logical understanding of

10:49.840 --> 10:55.880
why we're pursuing what we're pursuing, even as we conduct the pursuit in itself and apparently

10:55.920 --> 10:58.520
in a very logical manner.

10:58.520 --> 11:03.080
And so these questions, I think that I've just laid out, there's all sorts of potential

11:03.080 --> 11:04.080
answers.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.920
I'm not suggesting by any means that they're impossible to answer, but simply that you're

11:08.920 --> 11:11.880
not going to get the answer from the scientific method itself.

11:11.880 --> 11:18.640
These are questions where you have to introduce an element of interpretation of where you

11:18.640 --> 11:21.800
there's a point where you have to stop just looking at data and saying, well, this is

11:21.800 --> 11:27.160
what the data says, and actually bring to bear your subjective interpretation, your

11:27.160 --> 11:32.400
pattern recognizing software that your brain has given you and go out on a limb and say

11:32.400 --> 11:37.920
what you think it is, right, or say what you think the answer to some of these questions

11:37.920 --> 11:38.920
are.

11:38.920 --> 11:44.960
Now, as we've said Nietzsche, he first comes to consider these questions through his engagement

11:44.960 --> 11:51.520
with the pre-plotonic philosophers, the pre-plotonic philosophers hail from a time when the intellectuals

11:51.560 --> 11:57.840
did not divide off the question of why we do science from science itself.

11:57.840 --> 12:02.600
For them, the goal of constructing a metaphysical view of the world, a view based on first

12:02.600 --> 12:09.000
principles, was deeply related to the project of constructing physical principles for understanding

12:09.000 --> 12:12.880
the behavior of body and phenomena within the world.

12:12.880 --> 12:18.800
Now, a word on terminology before we go further, I'm using Nietzsche's terms here, pre-plotonics

12:18.800 --> 12:21.800
rather than pre-socratics.

12:21.800 --> 12:26.160
The meaning of the term is simply the pre-socratics plus Socrates.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.440
Now, why does Nietzsche call them a such?

12:28.440 --> 12:34.600
Because in his view, Socrates has more in common with the other pre-socratics than he does

12:34.600 --> 12:36.600
with Plato.

12:36.600 --> 12:42.600
Plato is a systematizer, and he blends philosophical influence from multiple archetypes.

12:42.600 --> 12:49.600
Because Socrates, like the other figures before Plato, are hemmed from a single stone, as Nietzsche

12:49.600 --> 12:53.960
says, or hewed from a single stone, excuse me, so they come from a time before there were

12:53.960 --> 13:00.240
formal systems of philosophy or any organized discipline defining what philosophy was.

13:00.240 --> 13:06.520
Each had to define the type of the philosopher as his own innovation.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.940
And so when I use the term pre-plotonic, we're talking about an era of philosophy as defined

13:10.940 --> 13:16.120
by Nietzsche, before the philosophical system building and the blending of philosophical

13:16.120 --> 13:20.800
styles and ideas that is found in the writings of Plato.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.560
Now Nietzsche has a particular theory about who the pre-plotonics were, which he outlines

13:25.560 --> 13:31.820
in his lectures on them, and my primary source for today is a book that has those lectures

13:31.820 --> 13:35.680
with commentary translated by Gregory Whitlock.

13:35.680 --> 13:41.220
And it's an indispensable resource for understanding the development of Nietzsche's thought, and

13:41.220 --> 13:43.020
I highly recommend this book.

13:43.020 --> 13:48.380
I'll be drawing in Whitlock's commentary as much as his translation, if not more so.

13:48.380 --> 13:53.260
And so in any case, Nietzsche's theory when it comes to understanding the pre-plotonics

13:53.260 --> 13:59.420
is that they were a series of Greek philosophers whose great insight, their collective project,

13:59.420 --> 14:06.320
to speak, whether in conscious collaboration or not, was the innovation of materialism.

14:06.320 --> 14:13.280
That Greek philosophy leading up to Plato represented the critique of mythological explanations

14:13.280 --> 14:18.760
of the world breaking away from the supernatural view of reality, and an attempt to understand

14:18.760 --> 14:27.720
reality that increasingly moved towards materialist explanations, physical laws governing reality.

14:27.720 --> 14:33.020
This is important first because Nietzsche believes that this progression towards materialism

14:33.020 --> 14:35.140
is cyclical.

14:35.140 --> 14:40.380
While we see one example of it in the pre-plotonics, Nietzsche believes we can see the same pattern

14:40.380 --> 14:42.180
in the European Enlightenment.

14:42.180 --> 14:49.060
It's important to clarify, therefore, that what's repeating here is not the acquisition

14:49.060 --> 14:51.260
of the exact same scientific knowledge.

14:51.260 --> 14:54.660
I mean, that would be kind of an absurd claim.

14:54.660 --> 14:58.720
It's given that the things that are learning and the technology available is different

14:58.720 --> 15:02.560
in both cases.

15:02.560 --> 15:09.440
But rather, it's a similar course of development of a worldview based on science, and what

15:09.440 --> 15:12.800
that means exactly will become clear as we go on.

15:12.800 --> 15:17.160
But Nietzsche doesn't believe, importantly, that this pattern is culturally specific to

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
the Greeks.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.080
I think this would apply to us today, right?

15:21.080 --> 15:25.660
Another reason why Nietzsche's argument may be relevant to us now is because he asserts

15:25.660 --> 15:32.980
that the materialist understanding of the world is an inevitable consequence of philosophizing.

15:32.980 --> 15:39.480
Furthermore, that the materialist understanding is both powerful and dangerous when it's taken

15:39.480 --> 15:43.060
through to its ultimate conclusions.

15:43.060 --> 15:47.980
Nietzsche asserts that the ultimate conclusion of a materialist philosophy, the goal or the

15:47.980 --> 15:55.440
end of materialism as he sees it, is the forging of a single principle for understanding life

15:55.440 --> 16:02.720
and understanding reality, from which all other equations and formulae can be derived,

16:02.720 --> 16:09.000
from which the no longer disconnected facts of reality can be ordered, right?

16:09.000 --> 16:15.600
This revolution and thought happened in fits and starts, as all revolutions do, and it

16:15.600 --> 16:20.180
should be said that Nietzsche saw some figures as dead ends or regressions.

16:20.180 --> 16:25.260
But nevertheless, he trots out a new chronology of the pre-plotonic philosophers, and he

16:25.260 --> 16:30.360
gives a picture in which each figure takes a further step in coming up with that single

16:30.360 --> 16:35.940
coherent principle for describing and explaining physical reality.

16:35.940 --> 16:40.460
And so the way Nietzsche is thinking about this, we might notice, therefore may seem

16:40.460 --> 16:47.320
to conflate science and philosophy, or you could even say it conflates science, philosophy,

16:47.320 --> 16:49.000
and metaphysics, right?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.840
They all become part of the same project.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.400
And so are there problems that could arise from this kind of framing?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.480
I mean, of course, right?

16:57.480 --> 17:01.920
But this is the way that many of the pre-plotonics would have thought about these things.

17:01.920 --> 17:10.160
All of these disciplines of thought are differentiated to us now.

17:10.160 --> 17:16.460
But they are also part of this unified, overarching thing that we call the pursuit of truth.

17:16.460 --> 17:22.500
And maybe a good faith way or a steelman way of trying to understand the argument for conflating

17:22.500 --> 17:26.620
these things, for doing the opposite of what we like to do in philosophy, right?

17:26.620 --> 17:28.740
Make distinctions.

17:28.740 --> 17:34.900
Here's maybe my steelman argument for thinking in a less granular way, the way the pre-plotonics

17:34.900 --> 17:40.780
would, that a scientific understanding without the explanatory framework found in metaphysics

17:40.780 --> 17:46.400
or philosophy becomes just a senseless cluster of trivial facts.

17:46.400 --> 17:52.640
That metaphysics without philosophy or science just falls into dogmatism, superstitious religious

17:52.640 --> 17:54.640
views of the world.

17:54.640 --> 17:59.000
And that philosophy done without a grounding in science or without a concern for its first

17:59.000 --> 18:08.520
principles, it becomes just context specific idiomatic sayings or idle speculation, right?

18:08.520 --> 18:14.580
And so while we now understand the many disciplines of academia with greater granularity these

18:14.580 --> 18:19.020
days, and that's very useful and certainly an innovation, we should still understand

18:19.020 --> 18:24.620
the sense in which if one cares about obtaining some kind of world picture that even remotely

18:24.620 --> 18:31.640
approaches the truth, the concerns of science and philosophy have to become unified.

18:31.640 --> 18:38.680
That's a view shared by Edward Zeller, who's a philologist and another prominent 19th century

18:38.680 --> 18:43.120
figure who before Nietzsche was one of the most important writers in the topic of Greek

18:43.120 --> 18:45.120
philosophy.

18:45.120 --> 18:52.280
Zeller writes in his outlines of the history of philosophy published in 1883, quote, what

18:52.280 --> 18:58.460
particularly distinguishes this oldest period of Greek philosophy is the complete fusion

18:58.460 --> 19:03.380
of philosophy and science, end quote.

19:03.380 --> 19:07.140
Some have considered Zeller to be a Hegelian.

19:07.140 --> 19:12.300
Whitlock argues in his commentary that Zeller bears far more similarity to the other Neocontian

19:12.300 --> 19:19.060
thinkers that influence Nietzsche than to the Hegelians, although he certainly did have

19:19.060 --> 19:21.300
a Hegel influence.

19:21.300 --> 19:26.920
And in fact we can see some intellectual kinship between the two men insofar as Zeller would

19:26.920 --> 19:30.240
go on to quote from Nietzsche's own work.

19:30.240 --> 19:35.080
Nietzsche often goes against Zeller in these lectures, but they also find agreement on

19:35.080 --> 19:39.840
some points and where they align most is in their fundamental attitude towards the Greeks,

19:39.840 --> 19:45.160
as both Zeller and Nietzsche held that the study of the Greek philosophers was valuable

19:45.160 --> 19:47.040
in and of itself.

19:47.040 --> 19:51.740
In contrast to the view that the Greeks should be understood as merely a prerequisite to

19:51.740 --> 19:57.860
modern philosophical or scientific thinking, or that Greek philosophy is merely an early

19:57.860 --> 20:05.020
stage, something inferior or half formed in comparison to our modern ideas, it's simply

20:05.020 --> 20:07.300
a prelude.

20:07.300 --> 20:12.540
That was the common historiographical approach to Greek philosophy.

20:12.540 --> 20:18.280
It was seen as maybe a curiosity, but nothing more.

20:18.280 --> 20:22.360
The view of the Contians was somewhat similar.

20:22.360 --> 20:28.320
That philosophy is separate from the history of philosophy.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.800
Learning about the Greeks is valuable to the history of philosophy, certainly, but it's

20:31.800 --> 20:37.800
not philosophically valuable in and of itself to study the Greeks.

20:37.800 --> 20:43.460
You might also consider another sort of the inverse that we might find, right, of people

20:43.460 --> 20:47.360
who wouldn't say the Greeks are unimportant, but say the Greeks are very important because

20:47.360 --> 20:49.640
we find all of our initial ideas there.

20:49.640 --> 20:55.400
We might consider Nietzsche's own criticisms of classicists when approaching the Greeks,

20:55.400 --> 21:01.860
when he outlines his arguments in Birth of Tragedy, that conversely, they saw great significance

21:01.860 --> 21:06.340
to the Greeks, but they made the mistake insofar as they approached them only to project their

21:06.360 --> 21:12.080
own values and their own beliefs and meanings onto the Greeks.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.840
So that was happening a lot also.

21:14.840 --> 21:19.600
The Hegelians, on the other hand, they do something that made possible a new understanding

21:19.600 --> 21:26.600
of the history of thought, by in some sense unifying the history of philosophy with philosophy

21:26.600 --> 21:28.480
itself.

21:28.480 --> 21:34.740
After Hegel, ideas are not understood as originating purely out of logical deliberation

21:34.800 --> 21:36.880
as Kant had imagined.

21:36.880 --> 21:42.480
Hegel affects this historical turn in philosophy, and in the wake of him, there's this concept

21:42.480 --> 21:49.400
that ideas emerge out of a dialectic, that there's not a decontextualized, pure origin

21:49.400 --> 21:52.440
of truth out of the lap of being.

21:52.440 --> 21:59.200
Truth is a process, and therefore the Greeks must be understood as part of that process.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.400
So we're getting somewhere, but nevertheless the Hegelians still tended to hold that the

22:03.420 --> 22:06.380
Greeks were a preliminary stage, right?

22:06.380 --> 22:12.660
Everything in history has merely been leading up to Hegel's conception of the absolute.

22:12.660 --> 22:17.540
Philosophy and the history of philosophy are unified, yes, but there is still a progression,

22:17.540 --> 22:22.740
upon which a Gaelian philosophy is farther along than Greek philosophy.

22:22.740 --> 22:28.220
And so Hegel gives the Greeks far more credit, but still ultimately interprets Greek philosophy

22:28.220 --> 22:32.180
according to his own philosophical ideas.

22:32.180 --> 22:36.240
The difference in how Nietzsche approaches the pre-Platonics and Greek philosophy in

22:36.240 --> 22:42.740
general is informed by the influence on his thought of the Neocontians.

22:42.740 --> 22:48.600
The relationship between Kant and the Neocontians is very fascinating, but it's a bit complicated,

22:48.600 --> 22:49.960
it takes a little off the path.

22:49.960 --> 22:56.480
So the key aspect is that the Neocontians share in common with Nietzsche on this issue

22:56.840 --> 23:02.640
The fact that they dared to look at the Greeks with an eye for what the Greeks could teach us,

23:02.640 --> 23:08.320
not to see them as naive and less intelligent, or a mere curiosity, mere freaks of thought,

23:08.320 --> 23:14.960
as Hegel said, past historiographers had looked at the Greeks, and not to project their own

23:14.960 --> 23:22.680
ideas onto them, not as a preliminary stage, but as something complete in itself.

23:22.680 --> 23:28.080
Many among the Neocontian philosophers of science look to the Greeks as themselves being

23:28.080 --> 23:33.600
instructive and unique in possessing their own distinctive character.

23:33.600 --> 23:38.520
And so Whitlock writes in his commentary,

23:38.520 --> 23:45.520
Operating in stark contrast to the dominant, self-projective methods of these schools,

23:45.520 --> 23:49.560
Nietzsche sought to learn something of the Greeks for their own sake.

23:49.560 --> 23:54.880
He did this not because the Greeks could aid modern humanity with quaint phrases, or because

23:54.880 --> 24:00.140
the Greeks were a necessary stage of Hegelian spirit, or because they discovered the idea

24:00.140 --> 24:01.640
of beauty.

24:01.640 --> 24:06.880
No, Nietzsche sought to learn of the Greeks for the value of the knowledge itself because

24:06.880 --> 24:10.080
the Greeks were themselves fascinating and insightful.

24:10.080 --> 24:16.120
He was careful to discover what dialectic actually employed the Greek drive to philosophy.

24:16.120 --> 24:21.280
This dialectic is indeed one of natural science, but science has understood differently than

24:21.280 --> 24:27.120
by either Kant or Hegel.

24:27.120 --> 24:34.080
The reason why the Neocontians provided an ingredient that helped Nietzsche along in

24:34.080 --> 24:40.440
moving beyond what we might call the view of Kant himself, or the Paleo-Contian view,

24:40.440 --> 24:47.000
It's found in the fact that Friedrich Uberweg and Friedrich Albert Lange, both Neocontians,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.880
they wrote books interpreting Greek philosophers as being materialists, and they were themselves

24:51.880 --> 24:54.120
materialists, right?

24:54.120 --> 24:58.920
And so they suggested that the Greeks discovered things in their pursuit of understanding the

24:58.920 --> 25:03.840
material world that can be instructive to us still today.

25:04.240 --> 25:10.840
Zeller, a figure that, again, has one foot in Hegelianism and another foot in Neocontianism,

25:10.840 --> 25:17.360
he gives a great explication of this attitude, quoting from the same text as before, he writes,

25:17.360 --> 25:23.260
The systems built up by the Greek philosophers are not to be regarded merely as a preparation

25:23.260 --> 25:24.760
for modern philosophy.

25:24.760 --> 25:29.920
They have a value in themselves alone as an achievement in the development of man's intellectual

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
life.

25:31.560 --> 25:37.040
It was the Greeks who won for man freedom and independence of philosophic thought, who

25:37.040 --> 25:42.520
proclaimed the autonomy of reason and gave it a two-fold application.

25:42.520 --> 25:47.080
Wisdom in the Greek sense included not only a theoretical explanation of the world, but

25:47.080 --> 25:49.960
also a definite practical attitude to life.

25:49.960 --> 25:55.140
Thus, apart from independence of scientific thought, it was the freedom to live life as

25:55.140 --> 26:04.140
he pleased, autarchy, that distinguished the Greek wise man, end quote.

26:04.140 --> 26:10.140
Or if we want to look to somebody who is more purely Neocontian, we could look to Friedrich

26:10.140 --> 26:16.220
Albert Lange's statements in his monumental work, History of Materialism, which is really

26:16.220 --> 26:17.940
a central work for Nietzsche.

26:17.940 --> 26:23.300
It's a work whose importance pervades all of Nietzsche's thought.

26:23.300 --> 26:30.120
Nietzsche writes, quote, with the freedom and boldness of the Hellenic mind was united

26:30.120 --> 26:37.420
and innate ability to draw inferences, to enunciate clearly and sharply general propositions,

26:37.420 --> 26:42.580
to hold firmly and surely to the premises of an inquiry, and to arrange the results

26:42.580 --> 26:50.140
clearly and luminously, in a word, the gift of scientific deduction, end quote.

26:51.140 --> 26:58.060
Now, I could see an objection here, you know, insofar as Lange, Ubreweg and the other Neocontians

26:58.060 --> 27:03.260
saw the Greeks as valuable, you know, they're the first ones daring to liberate philosophical

27:03.260 --> 27:07.300
thought from superstition, allowing the advent of materialism, right?

27:07.300 --> 27:12.980
And yet, these people who were saying this are themselves materialists, which means we're

27:12.980 --> 27:17.620
looking back the pre-plotonics and we're saying, oh, they're just like me, right?

27:17.620 --> 27:23.460
So couldn't we accuse them of doing what Nietzsche criticized the classicists for doing?

27:23.460 --> 27:28.460
Simply projecting their own views onto the subject of their research.

27:28.460 --> 27:32.900
And further, might we not say the same of Nietzsche?

27:32.900 --> 27:38.340
Because he gets many of his own ideas, he says, originate in these figures.

27:38.340 --> 27:45.460
So Whitlock writes, quote, Nietzsche too projects himself onto the Greeks, seeing them as discoverers

27:45.460 --> 27:50.220
of the will to power and of the eternal return of the same.

27:50.220 --> 27:56.940
Their struggle is one of materialism, precipitating an unconscious slide over many centuries into

27:56.940 --> 28:02.540
the abyss of nihilism, end quote.

28:02.540 --> 28:07.460
And so, while we inarguably see the first seeds of Nietzsche's philosophy in his study

28:07.460 --> 28:13.540
of the pre-plotonics, we have to ask whether he genuinely discovered something from them,

28:13.540 --> 28:17.740
that he then brought into the present through his writings, or whether he simply projected

28:17.740 --> 28:18.740
onto them.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.460
And we could ask the same of Lange and Uberweg.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.660
But suffice to say, I think this question is unanswerable, right?

28:24.660 --> 28:29.020
So whether these seeds of the ideas came from the Greeks or were merely projected onto them,

28:29.020 --> 28:34.340
it's only through Nietzsche's engagement with these figures that these ideas gestated.

28:34.340 --> 28:39.940
It's through the interaction of his mind with the Greeks that these ideas emerged.

28:39.940 --> 28:44.660
And in the, you know, it's a simple fact, before him no one else had found these ideas

28:44.660 --> 28:48.780
as clearly, put them as clearly, as powerfully, as forcefully as Nietzsche did.

28:48.780 --> 28:53.740
And so in some sense, we can set that issue aside as to whether Nietzsche was actually

28:53.740 --> 28:58.140
engaging with the Greeks in a truly original way or not, that transcended the limitations

28:58.140 --> 29:01.060
of these other schools.

29:01.060 --> 29:06.140
But by understanding the dialogue and the evolution of how philosophers tended to look

29:06.140 --> 29:12.900
at the Greeks, we can better understand where Nietzsche saw himself entering this dialogue,

29:12.900 --> 29:16.060
this dialogue that was now running for centuries.

29:16.060 --> 29:22.020
And now we understand the question being asked, how long we approach the philosophers of antiquity?

29:22.020 --> 29:26.460
What is the nature of their significance?

29:26.460 --> 29:32.100
Nietzsche answers these questions following in the thought of neocontians such as Lange,

29:32.100 --> 29:37.100
that the pre-Platonics charted a course forward into materialism as we've described.

29:37.100 --> 29:45.100
And Nietzsche argues that materialist philosophy is a kind of prerequisite scientific experimentation,

29:45.100 --> 29:48.540
at least as a methodological presupposition.

29:48.540 --> 29:53.020
And I think there's a good argument for that, that whether or not you fully accept like a

29:53.020 --> 30:00.420
purely materialistic view of the world, it's almost a prerequisite methodological assumption

30:00.420 --> 30:03.460
to go gather empirical data.

30:03.460 --> 30:09.860
And so thus training ourselves to think materialistically is required for science.

30:09.860 --> 30:16.020
And so Nietzsche believes that scientific thinking must arrive hand in hand with philosophy

30:16.020 --> 30:17.660
itself.

30:17.660 --> 30:25.020
And the conclusion therefore is that the advent of the activity of philosophizing and the philosopher

30:25.020 --> 30:35.140
as a specific type among other types in society necessarily arises mutually with materialism.

30:35.140 --> 30:40.900
This doesn't mean you get philosophers, you know, some guy identifies himself as a philosopher

30:40.900 --> 30:44.100
and suddenly your whole society is materialistic overnight.

30:44.100 --> 30:51.780
It means that the tendency and the capacity to think in materialistic terms as a presupposition

30:51.780 --> 30:54.660
necessary for the scientific method.

30:54.660 --> 31:00.020
It begins to emerge and it does so with greater and greater force over time as the power of

31:00.020 --> 31:03.980
science becomes revealed to a culture.

31:03.980 --> 31:09.340
Longa provides the basis for this idea in a section from history of materialism as follows.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.340
Quote,

31:10.340 --> 31:15.900
Materialism is as old as philosophy, but not older.

31:15.900 --> 31:21.060
The physical conception of nature, which dominates the earliest periods of the history of thought

31:21.060 --> 31:28.060
remained ever entangled in the contradictions of dualism and the fantasies of personification.

31:28.060 --> 31:33.940
The first attempts to escape from these contradictions, to conceive the world as a unity and to rise

31:33.940 --> 31:40.540
above the vulgar errors of the senses leads directly into the sphere of philosophy.

31:40.540 --> 31:45.700
And amongst these first attempts, materialism has its place.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.140
End quote.

31:48.300 --> 31:54.940
So there is a logic to conflating these things, the emergence of philosophy with the emergence

31:54.940 --> 31:58.580
of science and the emergence of materialism.

31:58.580 --> 32:04.100
We tend to think that some form of advanced, you know, scientific, materialist mindset

32:04.100 --> 32:09.020
that that's a type of ideology specific to modernity.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.860
But Longa and Nietzsche would both oppose that view.

32:12.980 --> 32:19.500
Longa emerges as a form of wisdom, which is critical of religion and which then pursues

32:19.500 --> 32:24.420
truth outside of revelatory knowledge, you know, outside of, you know, in ancient Greece,

32:24.420 --> 32:29.780
it would have been like, irracular wisdom and the superstitions of the mystery cults.

32:29.780 --> 32:37.380
It attempts to systematize and make things clear, you know, not vague or mystical and

32:37.420 --> 32:44.900
not like the disconnected, fragmentary, aphoristic wisdom, right, of people like the sages of

32:44.900 --> 32:46.140
old.

32:46.140 --> 32:52.500
And where this inevitably leads is for philosophy to question explanations of the world, which

32:52.500 --> 32:59.220
have to venture outside of what we can understand or observe by personifying nature or seeing

32:59.220 --> 33:03.500
the work of gods or spirits behind the phenomenal world.

33:03.500 --> 33:08.460
The more that the light of reason is applied, the more these avenues from explaining the

33:08.460 --> 33:13.900
material world in terms of a supernatural world, the more those are cut off.

33:13.900 --> 33:19.060
And the completion of this process is to explain the material world purely in terms of the

33:19.060 --> 33:23.820
activities and processes that we can perceive and measure.

33:23.820 --> 33:28.380
The final or ultimate end of that project is to produce a unified understanding of the

33:28.380 --> 33:30.700
world within those terms.

33:30.700 --> 33:36.620
And that's sort of the story of the pre-Platonics as Nietzsche sees it.

33:36.620 --> 33:44.220
And here we see how another influence underlying all this, which I haven't mentioned.

33:44.220 --> 33:48.580
There's a very big influence in Nietzsche's life that comes into the story here to provide

33:48.580 --> 33:51.500
a unique twist to his approach.

33:51.500 --> 33:56.780
And that is he brings in that opponent of Hegel as an influence on his thought.

33:56.780 --> 33:59.140
And that is Schopenhauer.

33:59.140 --> 34:02.700
Arthur Schopenhauer is the great philosopher of the will.

34:02.700 --> 34:07.260
As a contemporary of Hegel's, he raged against Hegelian philosophy.

34:07.260 --> 34:11.740
That Hegel had taken cons great insights into a completely unproductive direction.

34:11.740 --> 34:18.020
Nevertheless, Nietzsche's use of Schopenhauer is not so much to bludgeon the Hegelian view

34:18.020 --> 34:19.020
of history.

34:19.020 --> 34:24.580
Rather, Nietzsche builds on the Hegelian as much as anyone else did in the wake of Hegel.

34:24.580 --> 34:30.100
Hegel was so ubiquitous in his influence that fighting against Hegel would have been a bit

34:30.100 --> 34:33.860
foolish in some sense, and that isn't what Nietzsche does.

34:33.860 --> 34:39.980
Instead, he picks up on something within Schopenhauer, within his ideas that helps us to give a coherent

34:39.980 --> 34:45.140
narrative as to how all this works, what the Greeks were doing, and why this phenomenon

34:45.140 --> 34:51.660
of the philosopher arises, and why it exists in a culture, and what it's driving towards.

34:51.940 --> 34:58.540
That is, by drawing on the concept of a single will underlying everything.

34:58.540 --> 35:03.460
So you might wonder why is drawing upon or explaining the concept of a will that's driving

35:03.460 --> 35:06.460
philosophy even necessary?

35:06.460 --> 35:12.380
Nietzsche has a pretty good argument for this, and this argument is that there is no obvious

35:12.380 --> 35:16.620
need for a civilization to develop philosophy.

35:16.620 --> 35:17.620
It's wonderful.

35:17.620 --> 35:21.220
I love when Nietzsche points things out like this because he's, I mean at this point in

35:21.260 --> 35:23.060
his career, he's not exactly a philosopher.

35:23.060 --> 35:34.340
He's still a philologist, albeit philosophically curious, we might say, but not too many academics

35:34.340 --> 35:40.700
at that time would have questioned the validity or the usefulness of doing philosophy.

35:40.700 --> 35:48.500
That's sort of the heart and soul of the university, the most important among the faculties.

35:48.500 --> 35:52.060
But Nietzsche says there's no obvious need for it, and that in fact we actually have

35:52.060 --> 35:54.940
counterfactual examples.

35:54.940 --> 36:00.660
So Nietzsche writes, and this is in the introduction to the pre-plotonic lectures, quote, the question

36:00.660 --> 36:02.740
is attractive enough.

36:02.740 --> 36:06.980
How did the Greeks philosophize during the richest and most luxuriant period of their

36:06.980 --> 36:08.780
power?

36:08.780 --> 36:13.740
Or more principled, did they philosophize in this period?

36:13.740 --> 36:18.420
The answer will decisively clarify the Hellenic character for us.

36:18.420 --> 36:25.340
In itself, philosophy is of course necessary neither for one human being nor for a people.

36:25.340 --> 36:31.820
The Romans, as long as they grew only from within, are entirely unphilosophical.

36:31.820 --> 36:37.340
It depends on the deepest roots of an individual and of a people, whether he philosophizes

36:37.340 --> 36:38.340
or not.

36:38.340 --> 36:43.620
It concerns whether he has such an excess of intellect that he no longer directs it

36:43.620 --> 36:51.380
only for personal, individual purposes, but rather with it arrives at a pure intuition.

36:51.380 --> 36:58.420
The Romans are not artists, for the same reason they are not philosophers, end quote.

36:58.420 --> 37:03.820
So the Romans, unphilosophical people, as he says, but so long as they only grew from

37:03.820 --> 37:04.820
within.

37:04.820 --> 37:09.820
What he means by that is that Rome received religions and philosophies from the many places

37:09.820 --> 37:13.940
it traded with and conquered and incorporated into the empire.

37:13.940 --> 37:20.940
But Rome didn't have a homegrown philosophy, it didn't have a homegrown class of philosophers.

37:20.940 --> 37:25.420
You look through Roman history, the best you can do is maybe someone like Cicero, but Cicero

37:25.420 --> 37:33.180
is a philosopher of law and government, this pragmatic forms of philosophy.

37:33.180 --> 37:37.620
And whenever he gets in anything deeper, like ethics, he's almost totally dependent

37:37.620 --> 37:40.700
on the Greeks for his ideas.

37:40.700 --> 37:44.900
And so the Romans themselves, they're an intensely practical people, and their thought

37:44.900 --> 37:54.980
was, accordingly, unartistic, unself-reflective, self-assured, martial discipline.

37:54.980 --> 37:58.940
And then on the other hand, the Greeks do produce philosophers during the height of

37:58.940 --> 38:04.300
their power as a civilization, and interestingly Nietzsche makes an etymological analysis of

38:04.300 --> 38:10.620
the term wise in ancient Greek, which is the term that would have been used for the

38:10.620 --> 38:13.700
type of person that philosophized.

38:13.700 --> 38:17.620
And in Greek, it means something akin to useless.

38:17.620 --> 38:23.580
This does not apply to all knowledge, but specifically to the type of knowledge of the

38:23.580 --> 38:24.580
philosopher.

38:24.580 --> 38:29.620
The philosopher's knowledge is not the knowledge of an art or a craft, something which produces

38:29.620 --> 38:31.300
value or utility.

38:32.060 --> 38:35.260
Rather, the philosopher has useless knowledge.

38:35.260 --> 38:37.300
That's what it means to call him wise.

38:37.300 --> 38:40.340
In other words, being wise is itself a luxury.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.900
It doesn't have practical utility.

38:41.900 --> 38:45.860
It doesn't have value in the sense that a, certainly not that a Homo economicus would

38:45.860 --> 38:53.340
understand, and maybe it has even less so in the martial world of ancient Rome.

38:53.340 --> 38:58.820
To be wise is the privilege of those who have leisure time and who can spend their energies

38:58.860 --> 39:05.580
in their efforts in directions that go beyond mere survival or day-to-day existence.

39:05.580 --> 39:08.060
Whitlock elaborates on this in his commentary.

39:08.060 --> 39:13.460
He speaks of the first philosopher Thales as an example here, and I'm quoting in an

39:13.460 --> 39:16.540
upridged form, quote,

39:16.540 --> 39:21.300
What Thales knew surely seemed useless to the ordinary Greek.

39:21.300 --> 39:26.700
The adjective wise connotes useless, luxurious, or superabundant intellect, which Nietzsche

39:26.700 --> 39:30.660
will later connect to the Greek notion of noose.

39:30.660 --> 39:36.380
Designating a person wise, connoted to the ordinary language user, a knowledge of a field

39:36.380 --> 39:40.420
such as astrology, shamanism, or alchemy.

39:40.420 --> 39:47.780
To such a person, Thales would have been indistinguishable from other uselessly knowledgeable people.

39:47.780 --> 39:52.380
Such fine distinctions between astrologers and the rest would have collapsed into the

39:52.380 --> 39:54.860
adjective wise.

39:54.860 --> 39:59.300
To the ordinary language user, such thought is a luxury requiring superabundance of time,

39:59.300 --> 40:08.940
wealth, or intellect, noose, and consequently, tied to an alien reality, end quote.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.340
And so we have a counterfactual.

40:11.340 --> 40:15.660
During the flourishing of their power, Rome didn't need philosophers, which means philosophers

40:15.660 --> 40:20.020
are not a necessary factor to an ascending civilization.

40:20.020 --> 40:26.380
But the Greeks did produce philosophers, and so that presses the question as to why,

40:26.380 --> 40:31.180
which becomes all the more pressing, when their term for what philosophical wisdom indicates

40:31.180 --> 40:35.700
is that it's useless, and thus in some way unnecessary.

40:35.700 --> 40:41.700
So I would say at that point, it raises a question about what is it that drives the

40:41.700 --> 40:44.740
will to philosophize.

40:44.740 --> 40:49.300
And it reveals something about the Greeks themselves when we follow this inquiry.

40:49.300 --> 40:55.340
The Greeks teach us something insofar as they demonstrate to us an example of a culture

40:55.340 --> 41:01.580
that produced geniuses who all drive toward an encapsulation of the world within these

41:01.580 --> 41:11.460
principles of reason, and as Zeller says, doing so with the goal of clear enunciation

41:11.460 --> 41:13.420
of the principles of reason.

41:13.420 --> 41:17.380
And so this brings us back to some of the initial questions I raised.

41:17.380 --> 41:18.740
What is the point of science?

41:18.740 --> 41:21.860
What are we doing in pursuing scientific truth?

41:21.860 --> 41:27.260
And does science require a philosophy of science, or a metaphysics, and so on and so forth?

41:27.260 --> 41:34.460
Schopenhauer is the final ingredient in understanding the pre-plotonic specifically, and science

41:34.460 --> 41:37.540
generally within Nietzsche's new framework.

41:37.540 --> 41:42.620
Nietzsche can come at this question of why a culture would produce something ostensibly

41:42.620 --> 41:47.780
useless like the philosopher, but now with the understanding of the emergence of science

41:47.820 --> 41:52.980
and philosophy as driven by an underlying will.

41:52.980 --> 41:58.900
And the final object of that will is the encapsulation of the world in a single principle, the explanation

41:58.900 --> 42:03.060
of the material through the material world itself.

42:03.060 --> 42:08.900
That's the ultimate object of the intellect's desire as it seeks to liberate itself, liberate

42:08.900 --> 42:14.820
itself from dogma and from mythology, and leap from specialized, scattered, or disconnected

42:14.860 --> 42:21.500
knowledge into some sort of constellated, coherent world picture.

42:21.500 --> 42:26.380
Should be noted, will to power is not a fully formed idea at this point yet.

42:26.380 --> 42:30.620
Nietzsche hasn't even coined the term, really, but he has a head start because Schopenhauer

42:30.620 --> 42:35.620
has already provided the idea of the will as the inner character of all being.

42:35.620 --> 42:40.280
Schopenhauer also gives us an understanding of the various phenomena of the world as gradations

42:40.280 --> 42:43.780
of the will's self-manifestations.

42:43.900 --> 42:50.900
So he has this working picture of the will to go on as a sort of provisional explanation.

42:50.900 --> 42:55.540
Nietzsche says something in these lectures, then, that shows a prefiguration of his will

42:55.540 --> 43:01.100
to power idea, and the idea that the pursuit of truth or the pursuit of scientific knowledge

43:01.100 --> 43:07.600
is a rarefied form of a more fundamental drive or of a more fundamental will.

43:08.600 --> 43:15.600
The intellect must not only desire surreptitious delights, it must become completely free

43:16.360 --> 43:18.920
and celebrate Saturnalia.

43:18.920 --> 43:25.020
The liberated spirit surveys things, and now, for the first time, mundane existence appears

43:25.020 --> 43:29.720
to him worthy of contemplation as a problem.

43:29.720 --> 43:35.920
This is the true characteristic of the philosophical drive, wonderment at that which lies before

43:35.920 --> 43:37.600
everyone.

43:37.600 --> 43:41.480
The most mundane phenomenon is becoming.

43:41.480 --> 43:46.480
With it, Ionian philosophy begins.

43:46.480 --> 43:53.480
So, when he says the intellect must become free and celebrate Saturnalia, that is, of

43:53.480 --> 44:00.480
course, the Roman holiday, where the slave gets to play the master for the day and the

44:00.480 --> 44:04.480
masters serve the slaves, so everything is reversed, right?

44:04.480 --> 44:08.880
The slave is a free man, though, is the thing that he's invoking here.

44:08.880 --> 44:15.400
And so, taking joy in understanding the most mundane phenomenon, that's the beginning

44:15.400 --> 44:18.540
of philosophy and the beginning of science.

44:18.540 --> 44:24.440
From this perspective, we can see how an appeal to will, Schopenhauer's will, to explain

44:24.440 --> 44:26.680
the drive to science makes sense.

44:26.680 --> 44:31.120
It's the desire for freedom of the intellect from all constraint.

44:31.120 --> 44:35.600
That of course leads the intellect to seek dominion over all the world because that's

44:35.600 --> 44:39.360
the only way to be free of all the world's many constraints.

44:39.360 --> 44:42.800
And by this token, all the world becomes interesting.

44:42.800 --> 44:48.200
Even the smallest, simplest, inanimate things become phenomena to be understood.

44:48.200 --> 44:53.360
Every object offers a potential explanation about some part of reality.

44:53.360 --> 44:58.000
And so, we have the understanding of what this drive towards the scientific mindset

44:58.000 --> 45:03.520
is, taking joy in expanding the intellect's energy to understand everything, even the

45:03.520 --> 45:06.360
smallest things.

45:06.360 --> 45:11.240
So now, we're going to look at the interpretations of the pre-plotonic figures as they appear

45:11.240 --> 45:15.200
within these lectures, Nietzsche's interpretations of them.

45:15.200 --> 45:19.880
And through this understanding of Nietzsche's view of the emergence of scientific materialism

45:19.880 --> 45:26.080
in ancient Greece, we get an insight into, or further insight into the secret beginnings

45:26.080 --> 45:28.640
of his philosophy.

45:28.640 --> 45:34.120
So the first pre-plotonic philosopher is Thales.

45:34.120 --> 45:39.720
And Thales is sort of the traditional first among the philosophers.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.960
And that always presents a problem.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.440
Nietzsche acknowledges this in his lectures.

45:43.440 --> 45:47.760
He says, anytime we say that this was the first one, he says, this is almost always

45:47.760 --> 45:53.040
like a sort of, it's a falsification, it's an oversimplification of reality.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.240
The way he deals with that question, actually, is very interesting.

45:56.240 --> 46:03.360
But even though philosophy existed in some inchoate, unorganized form, Nietzsche says

46:03.360 --> 46:09.800
that the real question is not when philosophy arose, but when philosophers arose, he shifts

46:09.800 --> 46:10.880
the question in that way.

46:10.880 --> 46:16.520
He's not asking, well, when did a formal discipline such as philosophy become codified, or when

46:16.520 --> 46:18.480
did people first think philosophically, right?

46:18.480 --> 46:20.560
Because how could you answer those questions?

46:20.560 --> 46:26.200
But rather, when did the first person arise who appears as an entirely different kind

46:26.200 --> 46:29.360
of figure from the ones who came before?

46:29.360 --> 46:34.400
And when did that first figure arise who was definitively a philosopher and not classified

46:34.400 --> 46:36.800
under something else?

46:36.800 --> 46:41.640
He evaluates Thales as the first philosopher on that basis.

46:41.640 --> 46:47.040
And even though there could still be arguments either way that Thales could sort of fade

46:47.040 --> 46:52.800
into the background of all the other sages, Nietzsche thinks he's got a pretty good argument

46:52.800 --> 46:54.400
as to why Thales is the first.

46:54.400 --> 47:00.800
So to talk about Thales, he asserts that water is the fundamental element of all matter.

47:00.800 --> 47:08.000
All matter as we experience it, while it may be configured in a certain way as to be organic,

47:08.000 --> 47:13.520
or metallic, or wood, or fire, or air.

47:13.520 --> 47:19.200
Thales says it's all in its most fundamental, most basic form, water.

47:19.200 --> 47:22.440
It's also worth noting that Thales is also a scientist.

47:22.440 --> 47:26.360
He's noted for making a discovery having to do with eclipses.

47:26.360 --> 47:30.480
He was a mathematician as well.

47:30.480 --> 47:35.400
Nietzsche believes that Thales has overcome the previous preludes to the philosophical

47:35.400 --> 47:42.920
approach to life, the areas where maybe philosophy was sort of practiced in various scattered

47:42.920 --> 47:48.200
forms, but he overcomes all of this and steps forward as the first philosopher.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.200
Why?

47:49.200 --> 47:53.520
Well, Nietzsche says he's the first because he overcomes three things, which Nietzsche

47:53.520 --> 47:56.840
lists, and he overcomes them all at once.

47:56.840 --> 48:01.760
First, the preliminary, sporadic era of philosophy.

48:01.760 --> 48:06.520
These are the sages who spoke in aphorisms and sayings, but created no system.

48:07.520 --> 48:14.600
Second, the oracular, revelatory precursor to philosophy that's found in religion.

48:14.600 --> 48:18.400
And third, the various sciences.

48:18.400 --> 48:24.080
Thales overcomes these by positing his theory that everything is water.

48:24.080 --> 48:29.280
That explanation of this might seem a bit bizarre, but we'll look to Whitlock's commentary

48:29.280 --> 48:31.280
once more.

48:31.920 --> 48:37.520
Nietzsche's strange claim that Thales overcame the various sciences, strange because even

48:37.520 --> 48:44.040
if Greek thought is science, it had not specialized into various sciences, it becomes clear when

48:44.040 --> 48:49.920
we realize that Nietzsche saw in Thales the drive or will to reduce the world to as few

48:49.920 --> 48:57.080
laws as possible, and Thales assertion that all is water speaks from such a will, however

48:57.080 --> 49:00.760
rudimentarily.

49:00.760 --> 49:06.000
And further in the commentary, it's actually some pages later, Whitlock elaborates further,

49:06.000 --> 49:11.160
quote, Thales goes beyond mythic thought, use of sporadic proverbs, and even individual

49:11.160 --> 49:17.080
scientific pursuits to arrive at a multi-scientific understanding.

49:17.080 --> 49:23.760
His interests went beyond this or that physical phenomenon to the will to comprehend all physical

49:23.760 --> 49:27.880
phenomena end quote.

49:27.880 --> 49:31.760
So there we have it, the beginning of philosophy in Nietzsche's view, the first philosopher

49:31.760 --> 49:34.240
of the West, Thales.

49:34.240 --> 49:40.320
He represents to Nietzsche not just a philosopher, but a figure containing within him the entire

49:40.320 --> 49:46.120
story of the scientific drive, the entire impetus for the materialist project.

49:46.120 --> 49:51.800
He's the manifestation of this will to comprehend the entire physical world, the will to render

49:51.800 --> 49:54.000
the world into as few laws as possible.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.960
And of course, the fewest possible number of laws would be what would be one law, right?

49:59.960 --> 50:01.640
But we'll get there.

50:01.640 --> 50:06.760
Anyway, we can see the direct influence again on Nietzsche's thought from Friedrich Albert

50:06.760 --> 50:10.640
Longa, who also describes Thales as a materialist.

50:10.640 --> 50:16.320
And so this is from the history of materialism, quote.

50:16.320 --> 50:22.960
Materialism only becomes a complete system when matter is conceived as purely material.

50:22.960 --> 50:28.680
That is, when its constituent particles are not a sort of thinking matter, but physical

50:28.680 --> 50:35.540
bodies, which are moved in obedience to merely physical principles, and being in themselves

50:35.540 --> 50:42.200
without sensations, produce sensations in thought by particular forms of their combinations.

50:42.200 --> 50:49.080
And thorough going materialism seems always necessarily to be atomism.

50:49.080 --> 50:55.480
And so again, the animated magnet of Thales harmonizes exactly with the expression, all

50:55.480 --> 51:00.720
things are full of gods, and yet is at bottom clearly to be distinguished from the way in

51:00.720 --> 51:08.880
which atomists attempt to explain the attraction of iron by the magnet, end quote.

51:08.880 --> 51:13.200
And so very important things in this quote here, Longa is not only setting up what sort

51:13.200 --> 51:18.680
of the litmus test for how materialist your system is, which is very important, but he

51:18.680 --> 51:20.400
talks about the animated magnet.

51:20.400 --> 51:24.600
That's a reference to the idea that Thales said the magnet has a soul, right?

51:24.600 --> 51:29.880
The soul in human beings is how we account for humans ability to affect our own environment,

51:29.880 --> 51:30.880
right?

51:30.880 --> 51:35.800
To, or to, to affect movement, to move around, not simply be affected.

51:35.800 --> 51:39.480
We're animate, we're not inanimate, right?

51:39.480 --> 51:44.840
So the soul, we, that must be the thing that creates movement in his view, and thus the

51:44.840 --> 51:48.280
magnet must have a soul because the magnet moves iron.

51:48.280 --> 51:52.760
So obviously, you know, Thales is the first burst of materialist thought.

51:52.760 --> 51:55.640
He's not the completion of the project by any means.

51:55.640 --> 51:59.880
But we see the nature of this tendency, the underlying will.

51:59.880 --> 52:05.240
His position naturally creates problems, however, or confusions, which become questions for

52:05.240 --> 52:07.000
further figures to solve.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.400
And so we'll see this play out again and again with this sort of dialectic that emerges.

52:12.400 --> 52:19.120
Each of these parallels between Thales and three other figures who emerged in the European

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
Enlightenment.

52:20.120 --> 52:25.840
First, he compares Thales to Paracelsus, who was an alchemist, a scientist, and a philosopher

52:25.840 --> 52:31.600
of the 1500s, and who had his own theory concerning the transformation of water.

52:31.600 --> 52:34.680
You know, Paracelsus, through his work in chemistry, he came to believe that water was

52:34.680 --> 52:37.320
the fundamental form of matter.

52:37.320 --> 52:40.720
Water for Paracelsus is associated with the feminine.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.600
So we see some like, you know, alchemical ideas in there.

52:43.600 --> 52:49.760
It's the necessary condition for all flora, you know, all plant life, all organic matter,

52:49.760 --> 52:54.800
alcoholic spirits, oil based substances, alkali, you know, and so on and so forth.

52:54.800 --> 52:59.480
And so that's why he would draw the conclusion that water is so fundamental.

52:59.480 --> 53:06.000
The reason why Nietzsche makes this comparison is for the same fact that Paracelsus was definitely

53:06.000 --> 53:12.960
pursuing a scientific theory, which was materialist in character, or at least somewhat, driving

53:12.960 --> 53:14.960
towards materialism, we'll say.

53:14.960 --> 53:21.000
And furthermore, it was roughly analogous to the same hypothesis that Thales makes.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.080
And so this helps Nietzsche to establish the case that what Thales was doing can be classified

53:26.080 --> 53:29.080
as scientific in the same way.

53:29.080 --> 53:34.880
You know, another point of comparison is Antoine Lavossier, a French chemist who lived in the

53:34.880 --> 53:41.240
18th century, and Lavossier had done experiments by which he'd attempted to boil water for

53:41.240 --> 53:48.000
a prolonged period to see if it created sediment or, you know, became solid, trying to demonstrate

53:48.000 --> 53:53.640
that you could transmute an element, change it from water to earth, which was a form of

53:53.640 --> 53:57.440
struggle against the Aristotelian dogma.

53:57.440 --> 54:02.440
Whitlock helps explain why it's necessary for Nietzsche to therefore make the above

54:02.440 --> 54:03.440
two comparisons.

54:03.440 --> 54:11.240
Quote, this lecture on Thales does not simple-mindedly conflate him with Paracelsus or Lavossier.

54:11.240 --> 54:16.600
Nietzsche suggests that the continuing tenability in modern times of theories like theirs lends

54:16.600 --> 54:22.200
validity to interpreting Thales' fragments as scientific notions.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.360
End quote.

54:24.360 --> 54:30.960
The third point of comparison Nietzsche makes here is he compares Thales to the Kant-Liplas

54:30.960 --> 54:33.960
hypothesis.

54:33.960 --> 54:42.560
Nietzsche writes, quote, Thales sought a material less solid and properly capable of formation.

54:42.560 --> 54:47.120
He begins along a path that the Ionian philosophers follow after him.

54:47.120 --> 54:52.960
Actually, astronomical facts justify his belief that a less solid aggregate condition must

54:52.960 --> 54:56.880
have given rise to current circumstances.

54:56.880 --> 55:04.360
Here we should recall the Kant-Liplas hypothesis concerning a gaseous precondition of the universe.

55:04.360 --> 55:09.600
In following the same direction, the Ionian philosophers were certainly on the right path.

55:09.600 --> 55:15.960
To conceive the entirety of such a multiferous universe as merely formal differentiation

55:15.960 --> 55:22.680
of one fundamental material belongs to an inconceivable freedom in boldness.

55:22.680 --> 55:29.000
This is a service of such a magnitude that no one may aspire to it a second time.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.720
End quote.

55:31.720 --> 55:38.960
So he uses the same language there describing the Greeks in terms of freedom and boldness.

55:38.960 --> 55:45.920
And the Kant-Liplas hypothesis, which Kant in some sense makes reference to in the quote

55:45.920 --> 55:52.440
that we started the episode with, it's the idea of a gaseous initial state to the universe.

55:52.440 --> 55:59.440
It's an apparent chaos which is transformed by physical laws over time into some more

55:59.440 --> 56:04.600
complex state as we, you know, the state that it's in as we observe it today, which means

56:04.600 --> 56:11.200
you're starting from one form of matter and then through physical forces you get many

56:11.200 --> 56:12.360
forms.

56:12.360 --> 56:18.600
So Kant is, he's positing a fundamental form of material which acts in a certain way such

56:18.600 --> 56:22.720
that as a necessary result you get all the conditions we see.

56:22.720 --> 56:28.000
So again Nietzsche is not saying that Thales and the Kant-Liplas hypothesis are the same

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
thing.

56:29.000 --> 56:35.420
He's saying that the same road that Thales is traveling is found in the idea of a gaseous

56:35.420 --> 56:42.520
precondition to the universe, i.e. that we begin with matter all the same form and it

56:42.520 --> 56:44.880
changes an accord with the laws of nature, right?

56:44.880 --> 56:49.320
Or we get the situation we're in today as Kant says, you know, give me matter and I

56:49.320 --> 56:52.440
shall construct a world out of it.

56:52.440 --> 56:59.160
The next significant figure, actually more significant than Thales is Anak Simondar.

56:59.160 --> 57:02.720
Anak Simondar takes things further.

57:02.720 --> 57:08.800
He still attempts to hypothesize about the nature of being, but not by proposing another

57:08.800 --> 57:14.440
qualitative thing at the base of all reality as Thales does, you know, something definitive

57:14.440 --> 57:16.920
like water.

57:16.920 --> 57:25.160
Anak Simondar posits a principle that exists prior to any of the elements, including water.

57:25.160 --> 57:28.200
You know, I think he still says water is the most fundamental of them, but before that

57:28.200 --> 57:31.320
he says there's warmth and cold.

57:31.320 --> 57:35.640
These two forces are more fundamental than water and when mixed together they produce

57:35.640 --> 57:36.640
water.

57:36.640 --> 57:41.000
You know, it's the semen of the world that gives rise to all the other elements.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.640
But so far that's just a small advancement on what Thales had said.

57:44.640 --> 57:50.360
Anak Simondar's main contribution is that he then takes it a step further than that

57:50.360 --> 57:58.600
and says this eternal flux of warmth and cold is not itself the most fundamental thing.

57:58.600 --> 58:03.360
Even that arises from something else, from something that's still more fundamental, which

58:03.360 --> 58:06.240
is called the indefinite.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.240
That's how Nietzsche insists on translating it.

58:08.880 --> 58:18.680
The indefinite is this ultimate unity, Anak Simondar's first principle of nature, quoting

58:18.680 --> 58:24.640
here from Whitlock in an abridged form, quote, as Nietzsche argues, the cosmic significance

58:24.640 --> 58:30.760
of the indefinite is not as a grand collection of all qualities into infinity.

58:30.760 --> 58:36.080
Its importance lies in the fact that it alone has no qualities at all.

58:36.080 --> 58:42.040
In contrast to the watery universal flux with its countless qualities, the indefinite

58:42.040 --> 58:49.440
is quality-less matter, the substratum to all predicates, but not itself a predicate

58:49.440 --> 58:53.960
or predicated, end quote.

58:53.960 --> 58:59.200
Nietzsche's argument is that the advancement here is moving from a type of fundamental

58:59.200 --> 59:04.320
matter with a certain quality to the idea of the quality-less.

59:04.320 --> 59:10.440
And again, we're operating within this framework that blends or fails to separate philosophy

59:10.440 --> 59:16.960
and science, and so really, we can say that Anak Simondar is the first philosopher-depositor

59:16.960 --> 59:18.840
thing in itself.

59:18.840 --> 59:21.560
That's what his indefinite really is.

59:21.560 --> 59:25.400
By definition, it has no definite qualities.

59:25.400 --> 59:30.360
It's a fundamental form of reality that we can acknowledge but not describe, because

59:30.360 --> 59:35.000
anything describable becomes split off from the indefinite.

59:35.000 --> 59:41.200
It's an important point in the history of philosophy, also because Anak Simondar brings

59:41.200 --> 59:44.200
a moral dimension into this.

59:44.200 --> 59:49.840
His world picture, his attempt to bound the boundless within a single law, or the smallest

59:49.840 --> 59:58.320
set of principles, has moral implications, insofar as he explains this reality of temporal

59:58.320 --> 01:00:05.280
things with definite qualities, which are constantly arising and passing away, by asserting

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:11.640
that every phenomenon owes a debt to the indefinite for its individuated existence.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:16.780
So, we're living in this world where everything's arising and passing away, and then someone

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:22.880
comes along and says, the fundamental reality is this indefinite thing, which never arises

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.320
or passes away.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320
How do you get from A to B?

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.880
The question is, why is reality in this way that seems so fundamentally opposed to the

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.000
way you're describing what you say the fundamental reality is?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.960
You need to answer a theodicy to some extent.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.720
Theodicy is the wrong word.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:51.920
He says, Anak Simondar, that everything from people to rocks to trees to planets, even

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.760
the more fundamental elements or patterns.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:03.120
All of these things steal their existence from the indefinite, and that means that our

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:09.480
existence within this dynamic change, this becoming, as we called it, our very lives

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:16.680
are a form of injustice, and that injustice is remedied when we're returned to the indefinite

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.480
at the end of things.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.920
As for what all this has to do with the development of a scientific or materialist philosophy,

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.640
BitLock gives another excellent explanation, I must say.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:35.760
Quote, by introducing the indefinite into natural philosophy, Anak Simondar raised the

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.880
crucial philosophical issue of time.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.900
The indefinite itself is timeless.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:48.240
As ungenerated and indestructible, it is outside time altogether.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.520
For each individual world, or monad, time begins only when it breaks off from the indefinite,

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.280
and ends only with its own destruction.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.320
Each individual world is its own monadic measurement of time.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.480
With a succession of worlds, time begins anew again and again.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.320
Likewise, within one successive world, each individual measures time according to its

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.360
own monadic existence.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.880
Time begins and ends for each existent thing with its own beginning and end.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:27.160
The larger universe undergoes time in a similar monadic fashion.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.540
Microcosm and macrocosm are time monads.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:35.160
Only the indefinite is temporally indefinite.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:43.360
Nietzsche calls this Anak Simandrian time monadism, a view of the world worthy of serious consideration.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:51.360
This time monadism view is very similar to a fragment of an essay that Nietzsche wrote

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.840
in 1873 called the Time Atomism Fragment, which is something I plan to cover someday,

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:02.960
although getting too deeply into this topic now may derail this talk and take us too far

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.960
off the path of examining materialism.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.840
But while this type of thought from Anak Simondar is awfully metaphysical in comparison to the

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.600
way we regard scientific thought today, again, I think Nietzsche is correct to perceive.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.400
It was an attempt to hypothesize about the nature of time, which is a physics question

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.840
as much as a metaphysical one.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.280
And that perhaps we should notice relative to his era that Anak Simondar is not talking

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:37.400
about time by invoking Zeus or Kronos, he's conceiving of time in a non-anthropomorphic

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:45.000
way and in a way that makes time a force which is impersonal and emotionless.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.680
This is in stark contrast to the Greek picture of the gods, and so this is another thing

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:57.440
clawed away from the vague and cloudy explanations of mythology and brought into the light of

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.320
reason.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:06.520
And furthermore, this type of theorizing helps open up new avenues of questions, once again,

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.320
for future figures to come along and answer.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.800
How can things with qualities arise from something which itself has no qualities?

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.040
Is there a force that governs the rules of what is generated?

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:25.920
Would not this force be something above and beyond the indefinite itself?

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:31.240
If it's in the fundamental nature of the indefinite to generate things, wouldn't this nature of

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.200
generation therefore be a quality, thus making it something definite, something that we can

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.200
define by the fact that it generates, right?

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.320
And so these are all sorts of the things that come up in the dialectic.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:52.720
Now in this accession of or the chronology of pre-platonics, we're going to skip Anaximonies,

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.120
who Nietzsche sees as sort of a minor figure.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:04.160
We're also going to skip Gasp, Pythagoras, because as Nietzsche argues, Pythagoras is

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.800
really a cult leader and a superstitious religious figure.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:14.360
And that might seem surprising to say, given that the Pythagoreans were seen as scientific

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.600
innovators, you know, they're mathematical atomists and so on.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.200
So shouldn't they be, you know, fit right in?

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:26.480
And the later Pythagoreans do, but Nietzsche has an argument about this, which was novel

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:32.960
for his time, but I think is widely accepted now, where he drew on the work of his friend

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:40.000
Erwin Road, another philologist, to argue that the Pythagoreans came later than Pythagoras.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.280
And that Pythagoras, he's a very interesting figure in terms of his personality and in

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.120
terms of the archetype he represents, but that he ultimately is very different from

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.960
the Pythagoreans who came later.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.640
And Nietzsche treats them entirely separately.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.200
And Pythagoras therefore ends up being, he's very important because he's archetypal as

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:06.480
this like mystical, regal, law dispensing figure, you know, he's got this cult of personality

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.160
and Nietzsche sees the persona of Pythagoras as an aspect of Plato's personality.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:18.920
He's one of the three archetypes that sort of Plato blends together.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:25.680
And so that's not that Pythagoras is overall an important, but for understanding the development

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:32.760
of materialism in ancient Greece, he's not really a important figure.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.920
Another thing that Nietzsche is very concerned with in this whole thing, I should say, which

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.760
maybe I'm not getting across, it's also partly why I'm reading more of the commentary than

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.680
the translation itself, because the translation of the lectures is very interesting.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.520
But Nietzsche is very concerned in these lectures with establishing the chronology

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:56.080
of the preplotonic figures, which it makes sense because it's key to proving that his

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:02.280
narrative is correct, his narrative of how philosophy arose hand in hand with materialism.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:08.640
But since this is sort of an esoteric debate that, you know, is taking place within among

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:15.320
classical philologists, right, we're not going to spend any time talking about his chronological

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.320
arguments here.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.640
We'll leave that to the philologists and we'll just take Nietzsche's arguments for granted

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.280
on that front.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.440
Moving on, we come to Heraclitus.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.680
Heraclitus is of central importance to Nietzsche.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:30.400
We did a whole episode just on Heraclitus.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.340
That's all the way back in episode five.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:36.840
And we also covered some of the material from this episode in order to contextualize Heraclitus

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840
there.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.200
So if you do go back and listen to that one, you haven't heard it, you might hear some

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.160
of the same points covered.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:50.360
But we have to now include Heraclitus in this examination of the pre-Platonics for a different

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:56.200
reason because he's part of this descent into materialism.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:01.720
And so here we see a new development on this idea of finding a means of describing the

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:07.720
fundamental nature of reality, and it ties in with these considerations about time which

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.560
Nietzsche has brought up in Annex Cemetery.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:16.920
Well, Heraclitus is often contrasted with Thales, the guy who said everything was fire,

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.840
whereas Thales said everything was water.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.840
This is almost painfully oversimplified.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.960
By the time we get to Heraclitus, fire is more like a metaphor for something which is,

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:32.600
in some sense, indescribable because we're talking about the nature of being itself,

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.600
right?

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.600
So you have to draw on these metaphors.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.520
But Nietzsche says that Heraclitus is significant because he rejects being.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.880
There is nothing of which we can say it is.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.400
Duration is an illusion.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:55.280
Rejecting Annex Cemetery's idea that injustice is done by things coming into being and that

01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:02.920
the injustice is remedied when they pass away, Heraclitus says on the contrary, strife is justice.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.800
Rather than Annex Cemetery's indefinite, which is a separate thing from all the individual

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:15.680
monads experiencing time and separate existence, the thing in itself for Heraclitus is the

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.720
world of becoming in which we all live.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:23.240
Arising and passing away is the definite quality of existence.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.760
The nature of reality is revealed in how things arise and pass away, rather than concealed

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.000
by that fact.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.840
We don't hide a timeless reality behind things, but rather this world of absolute impermanence

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.080
is itself the ultimate reality, that's the Heraclitian view.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:44.080
And so there is a definite quality, which is change.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.720
Change is eternal and all-encompassing.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:53.960
The scientific associations that Nietzsche draws here with Heraclitus are incredibly fascinating.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:00.480
He invokes a thought experiment of Carl von Beyer concerning pulse rates, and he references

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.480
the thoughts of von Helmholtz on cosmic timescales also.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.600
I'm going to go into the lecture and read a rather long section of this lecture on Heraclitus

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:15.520
that is about von Beyer, because I think the only way for the full implications of what

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:20.680
Nietzsche is saying to come through is to hear the whole thought experiment as he lays

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680
it out.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.400
And so, quote,

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.560
Well then, since for example the pulse rate among rabbits is four times faster than that

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:02.920
among cattle, these will also experience four times as much in the same period, and will

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:09.120
be able to carry out four times as many acts of will as cattle, thus in general experiencing

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.460
four times as much.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.840
The inner life of various animal species, including humans, proceeds through the same

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:23.760
astronomical time space at different specific rates, and it is according to these that they

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.760
subjectively and variously judge the fundamental standard of time.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:34.280
For this reason alone, only because for us this fundamental standard is small, does an

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:39.200
organic individual, a plant or an animal, appear to us as something remaining at one

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.760
size and in one shape.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.200
For we could observe it one hundred times, or more, in a minute without noticing any

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.000
external alterations.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.600
Well then, we think it very important whether pulse rate, rate of sensation, and the human

01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:00.480
intellectual process either decelerate or accelerate, since in this way they are fundamentally

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480
altered.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.800
Assuming that the course of human life, with childhood, maturity, and old age, were reduced

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.520
by a factor of one one thousandth to one month.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.680
When that pulse rate were accelerated one thousand times faster, then we would be able

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.560
to follow a flying bullet very easily with our vision.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:26.720
If this lifetime were reduced once more by a factor of one one thousandth, limited to

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.640
some forty minutes, then we would consider the grass and flowers to be something just

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:36.600
as absolute and persistent as we now consider the mountains.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:42.000
We would perceive in the growth of a bud as much and as little as a lifetime, like when

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.760
we think of the geological periods of the earth.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.380
We would be totally unable to observe the voluntary movements of animals, for they would

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.200
be far too slow.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.000
At best we could conceive of them as we, in our time frame, think of the heavenly bodies.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:05.080
And with a still further reduction of a lifetime to a scale of one one billionth, the light

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.960
that we now see would perhaps become audible.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.600
Our sounds would become inaudible.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.680
When on the other hand, we enormously lengthen and expand a human lifetime, we get quite

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.320
another picture.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:23.540
Reduce for example pulse rate and sensation threshold by one one thousandth and then our

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:28.120
life would last at the upper end eighty thousand years.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:33.880
Then we would experience as much in one year as we do now in eight to nine hours.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.440
Then every four hours we would watch winter melts away, the earth thaw out, grass and

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:45.760
flowers spring up, trees come into full bloom and bear fruit, and then all vegetation wilt

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.640
once more.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:52.200
Many developments would not be observed by us at all because of their speed.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.800
For example, a mushroom would suddenly sprout up like a fountain.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.200
Day and night would alternate like light and shadows in but a moment, and the sun would

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.160
race along the arch of the heavens in the greatest hurry.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.680
Were we to decelerate this lifetime already reduced a thousandfold once again to a scale

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:15.240
of one one millionth, a human being would be capable of making only one hundred and eighty

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.960
nine perceptions in an earth year.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.680
The difference between day and night would entirely vanish.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:27.600
The solar ecliptic would appear as a luminous bow across the sky as a glowing coal when

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.440
swung in a circle appears to form a circle of fire, and vegetation would continually

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.480
shoot up and vanish in great haste.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.840
Enough then.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.000
Every shape appearing to us as persistent would vanish in the super haste of events and would

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.800
be devoured by the wild storm of becoming.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.760
Whatever remains, the unmoving proves to be a complete illusion, the result of our human

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:57.040
intellect."

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.800
And so, while Heraclitus philosophizes in such a scattered aphoristic form in which there

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.080
are so many interpretations and so many ways in which his ideas can be thought of as merely

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.880
poetic or something like that, Nietzsche sees in Heraclitus' ideas the potential for

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:24.000
a new way of thinking about duration, of bringing perspectivism to bear upon the concept

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.560
of duration and what that does to our cold concept of time.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:34.080
Nietzsche is influenced in this by the Neocontians again and by Schopenhauer, and so far as

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:40.360
both of those camps tended to regard time as part of our representation of the world

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.160
rather than something innate to the thing in itself.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:50.560
In other words, time is something we experience within our little monad of willing, wherein

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.560
our intellect represents existence to us.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.680
But time is part of the representation.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.480
It exists at the intersection of our intellect and reality as such.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.240
Time in our experience of it is infinitely divisible, as Nietzsche is doing there.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.920
Time is infinitely dividing.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:16.480
And as such, our understanding of what time is can't really be separated from our perception

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.480
of it.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.720
Like talking about time outside of the perception of time is a bit difficult.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.280
I mean, we can describe it mathematically, of course, but it becomes very difficult to

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.520
conceive to imagine what we're talking about, right?

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.000
And so Lange had the following to say about Heraclitus, in which we can see the influence

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.400
on Nietzsche insofar as Heraclitus fitting into the development of materialism.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:50.760
Quote, the boundless of Annex Cyminder, from which everything precedes, the divine primitive

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:57.800
fire of Heraclitus, into which the changing world returns to proceed from it anew, are

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:03.120
incarnations of persistent matter," end quote.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.520
So use the term boundless there, but he means the indefinite or the apron of Annex Cyminder.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:16.000
So Heraclitus' philosophy, it begins by invoking natural law, the logos.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.760
Heraclitus says there's a definite governing quality, a law according to which reality behaves

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.360
or nature behaves.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:29.280
And in logos, we have some element of intelligence within the essence of the natural world, some

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:37.000
quality that, you know, perhaps reminds us of Thales placing a soul within the magnet.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.480
And yet we're getting closer to this attempt to perceive a world which is persistent matter

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:49.160
and nothing more, existing merely in variegated transformations according to interactions

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.720
between the different forms of matter.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:57.760
So Lange sees this as a step in the direction of human beings coming to understand matter

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.240
as being persistent.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:05.200
But all this stuff that Nietzsche brings in with von Baer, comparing him to Heraclitus

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.680
yet again, once again shows Heraclitus is not somebody who's typically thought of as

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.720
having scientific notions, right?

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:21.240
When he says that duration is essentially an illusion in so many words and that change

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.160
is eternal, that's not taken as a scientific statement.

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.440
But the reason why Nietzsche then brings in these scientific thought experiments, which

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.640
are intensely neocontain, by the way, I mean, if all of our world is a that we experience

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:40.160
as a representation, it's, you know, the work of external reality interacting with

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.720
our sense organs, then other beings who have other sense organs or a different physiology,

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.880
a different pulse rate might be living in a different representation, so to speak, a

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.520
whole different world.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:58.160
And so following from those neocontain principles, and those ideas about time that we talked

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:08.120
about, Nietzsche comes to compare the, you know, somewhat obscure sayings of Heraclitus

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:13.280
as scientific notions yet again, it's very fascinating.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.200
So we're going to gloss over parminides next.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:24.280
And this is Nietzsche sees parminides and xenophonies as a dead end in the development

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.000
of pre-plotonic philosophy.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.520
And now Nietzsche does see parminides as possessing a mastery of abstract thought, and he has

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:39.920
to master abstract thought in order to assert his central idea, which in parminides case,

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.000
just to give a quick version, there's only one thing you can say, and that is the declaration

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.080
of the existence of being that it is the only thing you can sensibly say about being.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.840
And so of course, in parminides case, it's not that duration is an illusion, it's that

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:04.000
motion is an illusion, and that if anything, change is the illusion and duration is the

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.640
only reality.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.420
Parminides is not a main figure in Nietzsche's eyes, though, and he says further in a letter

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:19.620
to road, he considers parminides a great false step in the interpretations of pre-plotonic

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.140
philosophers.

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:28.060
So here's Whitlock, I've abridged this quotation a little bit, but he describes an important

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:34.700
difference between the thought of Nietzsche and the thought of Lange and it concerns parminides.

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.900
Parminides claimed the abstract oneness of all being.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:44.380
His assumption was that our human intellect is the measure of all things.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.860
Becoming therefore belongs among illusions of the senses.

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:55.220
Nietzsche called this twist of thought the most dangerous of all false paths.

01:20:55.220 --> 01:21:01.300
Lange considered parminidean being to be a doctrine basic to, but not identical with,

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:03.540
materialistic atomism.

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:10.600
Lange considered the atomists to be pluralists, and parminides and heraclitus to be monists.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:17.260
He ultimately considered parminides to be the least substantive and fruitful of the pre-plotonics.

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:24.220
Parminides' idea of the senses as delusion led into an epistemological cul-de-sac.

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:32.380
He should not be thought of as a philosopher of nature or physicist at all.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:36.740
In light of this, we're also going to skip past Zeno with his famous paradox.

01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:42.700
He's part of the same school of thought as parminides, although granted he had an impact

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:47.060
on the development of the dialectic and the discussion of problems inherent to these

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:50.780
current conceptions of space-time and motion.

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:55.740
The main problem Nietzsche has here is that he sees Xenophonies, parminides, and Zeno

01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:00.700
as essentially being anti-naturalists.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:04.380
We could spend more time talking about the nuances of them here, but we're not going

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:08.860
to go over every last figure, so we're just going to skip ahead.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:12.620
The interest of time and just the fact that if we're giving it from Nietzsche's point

01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:18.140
of view, he thinks these are a dead end.

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:24.180
Anaxagoras is a pivotal figure for Nietzsche who would come next.

01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:31.900
In the character of Anaxagoras, we see definitively that the string of figures each attempting

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:37.380
to describe the nature of the material world were not simply engaging in idle speculation,

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.380
but following a dialectic.

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:46.340
Anaxagoras is a great exemplar of how in the pre-plotonic philosophers we find many

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:51.660
of the same conclusions, concepts, or frames of thought that would be rediscovered in later

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:56.100
eras, such as during the Enlightenment of Europe.

01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:00.980
Nietzsche interprets Anaxagoras as having discovered the concept of the conservation

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:11.620
of matter, which Longa saw a first inkling of that within Heraclitus and Anaximander.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:18.620
Conservation of mass is a principle we use in physics to this very day, obviously.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:23.660
This holds that matter is indestructible, and it simply changes form.

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:29.140
We get a great leap here, and it happens with help from the Iliadics.

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:36.780
The properties which were formerly assigned to being, and which are associated, we might

01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:44.700
say especially associated with being among Xeno and Parmenides, that being is indestructible.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:50.380
This is now applied to becoming, to the matter that makes up the physical world in which

01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:53.540
we live.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:24:01.980
Anaxagoras revises the hypothesis of Anaximander, the idea of the Aipuron, the indefinite, the

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:04.860
thing in itself.

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:11.980
He says that instead the unlimited is a mixture of all qualities, it's not a quality-less

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.980
matter.

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.620
It's a mixture of all of them.

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:20.900
For Anaxagoras, the fundamental reality contains the seeds of all things that exist.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:24.940
That gets over the problem of how do you get things with qualities from a quality-less

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:25.940
thing in itself?

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.980
Let's get rid of the quality-less thing.

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:34.180
Where Anaxagoras differs with the Iliadics, he doesn't hold to their view of the oneness

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:36.620
of being.

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:40.620
Anaxagoras is, in all things, a philosopher of multiplicity.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:47.780
Whitlock writes of him, quote, between Anaxagoras and the Iliadics, Nietzsche argues, existed

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.980
a great disjunction.

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:55.420
Either the Iliadics were correct that being is one, and the many, along with motion, do

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.460
not exist.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:03.580
Or Anaxagoras was right, and there are infinitely many beings in motion.

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:09.980
Anaxagoras transferred the properties of Iliadic being to his beings.

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:15.100
And so, singular being to being's plural.

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:20.260
So in Anaxagoras, we have a further refinement of materialism, further progress in explaining

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:23.580
all the movement of matter according to the fewest laws.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:27.500
The principles he uses are mixing and separating.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:31.940
So in the picture he gives us, there are infinitely many beings.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:38.060
They emerge from an initial unlimited which contains all the potential qualities, and

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:43.180
then they behave according to these two fundamental behaviors of mixing and separating.

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.740
Not being created or destroyed themselves, these units of matter, but simply combining

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:51.140
and recombining according to mechanistic principles.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:56.980
Anaxagoras only appeals to some sort of intellect to explain the workings of these processes

01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:00.460
when his account of mixing and separating can't explain the effect.

01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:04.060
So there's still a god of the gaps here, right, in the form of the noose, you know,

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.060
the intellect.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:08.500
It's an element which is still very much necessary.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:17.820
But rather than being all-encompassing, as in the Heraclitian idea of, like, say, logos,

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:24.660
here intellect is only used as a last necessity, some sort of divine intellect in the system.

01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:31.020
Anaxagoras is expressing this will to, as much as possible, interpret physical phenomena

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:35.580
as governed by non-intelligent mechanistic processes.

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:40.060
And so that's a further step on the road of materialism.

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:48.060
But of course, a dualism still remains here, because that's one of the things that philosophy,

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:53.340
that science, has to overcome, right, that Longus says it has to overcome.

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:57.420
So we simply have a more refined dualism, but it exists.

01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:03.180
Now we have this old problem that you have motion, spirited motion, which is found in

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:11.420
organic life, us, animation, right, and then you have the motion of non-living objects.

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:14.260
This still exists in Anaxagoras.

01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:19.900
And so then we come to the question of mechanical versus non-mechanical motion.

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:24.500
And the question, can one's philosophical system include both?

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.740
Is it permitted to include both?

01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:35.380
And so this dualism naturally must be answered, and the next person in the dialectic to answer

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.380
it is Empedocles.

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:45.340
Empedocles is a very interesting figure, because he wavered between science and magic, is how

01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:48.580
he's described by many people.

01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:54.420
Nietzsche describes him, he's a man living on the edge of reason and irrational passions.

01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:01.620
Dabbles in poetry and rhetoric are science, religion, oratory, politics.

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:08.300
His significance to our inquiry here is that Empedocles introduces the idea of an original

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:16.660
non-mechanical motion, a first cause which sets all mechanical motion into play, thus

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.420
resolving the dualism, right?

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:24.340
This type of argument still employed today in theology, in the form of the first cause

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:26.820
argument for God, right?

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.340
Personal being within intelligence.

01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:32.740
So even though there are the laws of physics, which mean that angels aren't individually

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:39.500
pushing planets around, the first cause that is God set everything into motion, after which

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.220
all the mechanical laws of the universe can then govern everything.

01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:47.460
They don't need intelligence managing it at every moment.

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:53.420
But so we get this theological argument today, which we can say we find some form of it or

01:28:53.420 --> 01:29:01.160
like say it's indirectly inherited from Empedocles, and his particular attempts in this struggling

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.920
towards bringing our world picture into the light of reason.

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.780
But Empedocles, of course, has these two sides to him, so he also introduces something which,

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:14.900
in its modern form, is usually considered as one of the opening salvos against religious

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:17.260
thought.

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:23.580
Empedocles developed an idea of natural selection, forms which arise by chance, but which are

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:27.860
shaped or selected for based on conditions.

01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:35.220
Schopenhauer had recognized in his writings that Empedocles saw in plant and animal life

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.860
an inner dwelling desire.

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:44.340
Schopenhauer believed that this was akin to his own theory, that the inner character

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:51.300
of all things is will, and he considered Empedocles as a forerunner to his own philosophy, as it's

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:55.700
given in world as will and representation.

01:29:55.700 --> 01:30:01.540
More interestingly, for our examination, we might consider how Nietzsche believed Empedocles

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:08.020
to correlate in some sense with Darwin on this basis, in the same way that Thales correlates

01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:12.780
with Lovacier or Heraclitus with Van Baer.

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:20.740
And so Nietzsche once again shows his influence from Friedrich Lange, who wrote in his History

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:23.100
of Materialism, quote,

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:30.620
What Darwin, relying upon a wide extent of positive knowledge, has achieved for our generation.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:33.620
Empedocles offered to the thinkers of antiquity.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:39.820
The simple and penetrating thought that adaptations preponderate in nature just because it is in

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:47.140
their nature to perpetuate themselves, while what fails of adaptation has long since perished.

01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:50.140
End quote.

01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:57.700
Of course, neither Nietzsche nor Lange could consider someone like Empedocles to be a materialist.

01:30:57.700 --> 01:30:59.300
He's really not anything close.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.980
But Empedocles holds to view like the oneness of all things, and he believes that existence

01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:05.980
is a form of punishment.

01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:13.060
The strife endured within existence is the satisfaction of a kind of moral recompense.

01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:18.100
So we can see the precedent for those beliefs in an X-emender, for example, and how they're

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:22.340
getting carried on and those moral ideas are developing as well.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:26.740
And so that's perhaps one of these pitfalls of your science and your philosophy being

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:33.020
unified, right, is that as you have this dialectic pushing towards materialism, there's also

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:36.500
all this junk that's collecting.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:44.220
But Empedocles also sees these totally non-mechanistic forces of love and hate sort of governing existence,

01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:51.140
which means that Empedocles' overall understanding of the universe is not materialistic at all.

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:56.420
Nevertheless, he's still very important because Nietzsche's knowledge of Schopenhauer and

01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:04.220
Schopenhauer's comments on Empedocles probably helped broaden Nietzsche's understanding of

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:06.140
Empedocles' significance.

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:12.980
Because in addition to his point of comparison with Darwin, he can be helpful to Nietzsche

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:20.380
in introducing that conception that's akin to the will, the will that Nietzsche is sort

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:27.740
of using to explain the entire drive towards scientific knowledge.

01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:33.860
This is the point of the story when that explanation that Nietzsche is using to explain the drive

01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:38.860
to scientific knowledge is discovered by that same drive to scientific knowledge, right?

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:45.380
And so the inner dwelling desire, this driving that exists in all things, which Schopenhauer

01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:49.500
associates with his own conception of the will is then carried over into Nietzsche's

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.500
interpretation.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:57.540
We'll look at a Whitlock summary of Empedocles' significance here, and Whitlock sets up, I

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:03.560
think, the implications for us in terms of understanding how this is such a secret beginning

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:10.220
to Nietzsche's philosophizing and how Nietzsche picked up things from his examination of materialism

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:15.820
arising in Greece that would inform ideas throughout his whole career.

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:20.420
So here's Whitlock, and I've abridged this reading yet again, quote.

01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:25.820
In this lecture series, the evolution of Nietzsche's theory of the will is most pronounced

01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:34.580
in the discussions of Anneximander, Heraclitus, Annexagoras, Empedocles, and the Atomists.

01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:39.460
Empedocles took a crucial step toward Newton, Leibniz, and Boskovich.

01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:47.100
For the philosopher from Agregentum approached the world as force and matter.

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:54.500
Nietzsche connects the notion of an inner drive, tribe, with the notion of a primal power,

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.400
mocked of motion.

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:02.740
These are likewise connected to the notion of force, craft.

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:10.420
All these were crucial steps toward a theory of the will to power, Vilizumacht.

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:14.300
The notion of an inner drive is the Schopenhauerian will.

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:19.100
Rather than love, strife is its dynamic quality.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:24.420
A great failure of Empedocles was his inability to overcome teleology.

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:27.980
His ordered universe arose from mind.

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:33.460
Nietzsche's profoundly anti-teleological thinking demanded a repudiation of natural

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:37.340
purpose in the Aristotelian sense.

01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:42.780
Materialism presupposes such a rejection of teleology, so that Empedocles was ultimately

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.700
not a materialist.

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:49.660
It would be left to Democritus to combine all the necessary elements of materialism

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:55.220
into one system.

01:34:55.220 --> 01:35:01.500
Here we are so far as that Nietzsche, guided by Longa, as well as Ubreveg, Schopenhauer,

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:08.700
even Zeller, looks at each figure as a fascinating personality, offering a wholly unique philosophical

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:14.740
type, and yet together the pre-Platonics bring forth the development of a purely materialistic

01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:20.660
world picture, and we might think of how scientists and philosophers in the Enlightenment, which

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:25.180
Nietzsche is standing at the end of in his own time, some people say were still in the

01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:30.300
Enlightenment now, but I would say at the end of like the Romanticist sort of rebellion

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.980
against a lot of the Enlightenment thinking, and then the transition into the modernity

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:40.220
and the world wars, I don't know for exactly the same spirit of the Enlightenment that

01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:48.340
we were, but however you want to say it, Nietzsche is much closer to that period, and

01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:53.660
we might think of how those scientists, they emerged from a similar period of ignorance

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:59.540
and dogmatism, where the intellect was ruled by Aristotelian notions and by theological

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:06.620
prejudices, and it dawned on Nietzsche that the European mind once again had to proceed

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:13.720
out of this dualistic, personified, superstitious understanding of how the world functions,

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:19.460
and was now driving towards more and more mechanistic and material explanations, and

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:25.340
that this same pattern is what the prepletonics had done, but Empedocles is still thinking

01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:31.660
teleologically, which is sort of the last thing to get over.

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:35.900
Now it could also be argued Nietzsche has all the raw material for will to power and

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:41.460
the prepletonics that he's discussed, and what is will to power?

01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:47.540
I don't mean what is the actual will to power, the actual content, I'm saying like what is

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.900
Nietzsche doing when he comes up with the theory of will to power?

01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:56.660
I mean, Nietzsche's theory of will to power is his attempt to explain the world with as

01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:03.680
few laws as possible, with one law that governs existence, so we must consider the possibility

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:10.540
that will to power for Nietzsche is not just a metaethical principle, it's not just a psychological

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:16.400
principle, it's a scary thought, you know, scary for those of us who have safely compartmentalized

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:21.980
the grandiose claims about will to power into being, you know, purely psychological statements,

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:22.980
right?

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:29.540
It's a scary thought that will to power may have started, may have originated as an attempt

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:34.140
by Nietzsche to philosophize in the manner of the prepletonics.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:40.380
Nietzsche's attempt to craft a world picture that unifies both science and philosophy and

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:51.280
explains the material world by by means of matter and the use of a single principle.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:56.560
Now with democratists, it's the last figure we'll consider among the prepletonics, and

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:03.440
it's the climatic part of the lecture where we finally have a complete materialistic theory.

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.440
And this doesn't mean that democratists has solved all the questions in physics, right?

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.860
It means that with democratists, we have a view of the world in which no intelligence

01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:19.500
or personified spiritual forces or dualism is necessary.

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.580
Democratists gives us a theory of the atom.

01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.580
We get the word atom from democratists.

01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:29.980
And so he says, all things are made of atoms.

01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:37.420
And we can see how this develops out of the work of Annexagoras, the philosopher of multiplicity,

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:39.920
but democratists refines it even further.

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:47.080
Democratists defines atoms as the smallest unit of matter, the most fundamental unit from

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:51.120
which all other forms are constructed.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:58.480
This is the universe's multiplicity, as Annexagoras describes it, but democratists makes all things

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.800
nothing but atoms and void.

01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:06.820
Rather than appealing to a non-mechanistic first cause, or a metaphysical force such

01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:13.580
as love, democratists sees, as Nietzsche says in his lecture, quote, no chance whatsoever

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:20.300
but rather the most rigorous lawfulness, only not according to the laws of reason.

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:26.620
Well then, democratists derives all motion from empty space and weight, or mass, the

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:29.780
German word is Schwer.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:37.360
Many atoms sink down and drive the smaller ones upward by pressure, end quote.

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:42.880
Whitlock summarizes Nietzsche's overall assessment of democratists, quoting in an abridged form

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:49.120
here, quote, the lectures on democratists and the late Pythagoreans are the dialectical

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:54.520
culmination of the lecture series, for they arrive at a mathematical atomism, the most

01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:01.060
powerful of the ancient systems and the inner expression of will the Greeks had to explicate.

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:06.420
This lecture also clearly shows Nietzsche rejecting Schopenhauer's old worn out objections

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:12.860
to materialism, an enthusiastic favor of materialistic atomism.

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:16.420
Though reading between the lines reveals that Nietzsche was simultaneously developing his

01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:22.780
own theory of will within this materialistic atomistic discourse, the lecturer does not

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:29.640
hesitate to announce that atomism is quote, the truth for us, end quote.

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:35.520
And what Whitlock quotes immediately afterwards is something that I'll just read, it's from

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:44.240
back in the lecture, because it shows how Nietzsche sort of identifies with democratists

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:51.480
here at the end, quote, materialism is a worthwhile hypothesis of relativity and truth.

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:57.700
Accordingly, all is false has been discovered to be an illuminating notion for natural science.

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:05.020
We still consider then all its results to be truth for us, albeit not absolute.

01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:13.860
It is precisely our world in whose production we are constantly engaged, end quote.

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:18.900
And so in these remarks that will be perhaps frustrating for the epistemological realists

01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:26.120
out there, Nietzsche again tells us something useful about the way that he thinks.

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.000
There's a general attitude at this point in his career that's inherited from the Neocontians

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.920
that we live in a world of representations.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.640
That reality as we experience it is not an objective mind independent reality.

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.480
Now this doesn't mean there's no external reality, Nietzsche criticizes that idea in

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:48.260
Beyond Good and Evil simply by saying our sense organs are not themselves representations

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.340
of our organs that would be absurd.

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:58.060
Nevertheless, as the neuroscientist and noted reality skeptic David Hoffman has said, when

01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:02.180
we look at the neuron, you know, at a neuron of the brain, for instance, even through an

01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:07.380
electron microscope, we're still just looking at a pixel.

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:12.140
The neuron as we see it is a representation of something in the external world that our

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.320
brain is creating.

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.000
We live in our nervous systems, right?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.760
We can break down the pixel into infinitely smaller pixels, but it's still just all pixels.

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.760
It's a symbolical representation for something with which we have no direct experience.

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.080
And so that's Nietzsche's mindset epistemologically.

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.920
And it's interesting how his thought did develop on this as he went on.

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.000
But at the time of these lectures, I think this is the world Nietzsche is living in.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.860
And I think in that mindset, we can see the sense in what he's saying that mathematical

01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:49.220
atomism is the most refined form of materialism.

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.380
And that's true for both the Greeks and for those in Nietzsche's time.

01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:57.020
And even though the state of science in Europe was far more advanced than it had been during

01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:04.420
the time of the pre-platonics, Nietzsche's argument here is really one more of philosophy

01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:06.760
of science than of a scientific nature itself.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:12.360
That democratists coming from a time when science and philosophy were unified brings

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.600
about the dawning of a new mindset and a new view of the world.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:23.480
And now that our science and our philosophy are seen as separate things, we perhaps don't

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:29.640
see the ways in which scientific knowledge or scientific hypotheses carry with them this

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:32.880
shift in our view of reality.

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:38.180
We live in an atomistic world these days, just as democratists did.

01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:45.500
That we think of our reality as consisting of particles, of smaller building blocks governed

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:50.940
by physical laws, which are non-personal, non-intelligent, mechanistic.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:55.660
We live today in a democratian world.

01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:01.500
And I think that's what Nietzsche is pointing to about how this is the truth for us when

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:10.600
we behold democratists, we're seeing somebody who has come around to the same worldview that

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:13.720
we have come around to.

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.480
And so the narrative Nietzsche discovers is what I've called, as the title of the episode,

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.160
the descent into materialism.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:29.000
It's an archetypal narrative, almost, of how the arising of philosophy, the cultivation

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:35.220
of this useless knowledge, this wisdom that endeavors to bound the boundless, state clearly

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:38.460
all that is obscured and secret in the world.

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:42.580
This necessarily arises hand in hand with science.

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:48.620
It inevitably represents an ever stronger tendency toward materialism.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:56.460
And the final form of this is atomism, which we get to a democratist or in Nietzsche's

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.460
own time.

01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:01.120
I would argue we still tend to think about things that way today.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:08.480
Nietzsche therefore reinterprets the significance of science in accord with his own cyclical

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.840
ideas of time.

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.200
He sees the same phenomenon in ancient Greece as in Enlightenment Europe, because both are

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:22.120
expressions of the same underlying will, even though the details, the conditions are different.

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.320
But the will drives us to the same ends, because it's the same thing fundamentally in Nietzsche

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:29.220
incarnation.

01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:33.900
And so I think it's best to describe this as a descent as well.

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:39.340
And I intend this in both the positive and the negative connotations, because on the

01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:43.820
positive side of things, the pre-plotonics initiate this project of Greek philosophy

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.300
out of a will to bring the Greek psyche down to earth.

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:53.940
To take us out of flighty abstractions, take us away from that mystified gaze up to the

01:45:53.960 --> 01:46:00.160
personified heavens, the psychodrama that the Greeks saw in the stars, and instead look

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:05.200
to the smallest, most mundane things and take joy in understanding them.

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:11.800
This turn of our perspective inevitably leads us to learn the patterns by which things on

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:12.800
earth behave.

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:19.720
And we begin to explain the world less and less by recourse of reaching up into the clouds,

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:24.340
until finally with Democritus, we can explain the world without reaching into mythology

01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:27.060
at all.

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:31.820
But there's a negative side, and there's a negative sense to the word descent, that

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:37.660
this descent into materialism is also a descent into nihilism.

01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:42.660
We discussed this in the episode we just did on nihilism, and it's what Nietzsche called

01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:45.500
the problem of science in so many words.

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:51.280
It achieves its final form, so to speak, in the figure to follow Democritus and the later

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:55.480
Pythagoreans, who was Socrates.

01:46:55.480 --> 01:47:00.080
He's who basically comes next in the dialogue, the mystagogue of science, the man who made

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:06.280
reason a universal and binding principle, waged war on all the dogmas and superstitions

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.600
and illusions.

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:13.040
Science becomes this totalizing force, even when it threatens the preservation or the expansion

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.200
of life.

01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:19.180
And so here too, in this early philological study, Nietzsche finds one of the central

01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:23.820
questions and the problems that concerned his whole career.

01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:29.420
Nietzsche, at this time, he places himself in the milieu of the prepletonics and their

01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:36.700
quest for a materialist world picture, and influenced as he is by Longa, who is a materialist,

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:41.620
Nietzsche considers the creation of a purely materialist worldview as a form of triumph,

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:49.080
but he nevertheless has begun to see where materialism will inexorably lead, in life

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:55.160
being sacrificed to the truth, and this arrives with the figure of Socrates.

01:47:55.160 --> 01:48:02.800
And so, you know, this project really becomes, how can this tragic end to the development

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:06.880
of philosophy be overcome or dealt with?

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.140
That's like a central project of Nietzsche's, but that all begins here.

01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:18.220
All right, so that's it, we're going to do a similar subject matter next week, we're

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:23.480
going to actually continue with a lot of the same text, but we're going to, we barely

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.320
touched on Democritus, and he's in fact so significant to later Nietzsche, in parallel

01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:31.380
with another figure, Boskovich.

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:35.060
So we're going to spend the next episode talking about these two people, they're scientists

01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.460
and philosophers of science.

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:40.440
One ancient and one sort of like, I guess you'd say, pre-modern, it's Democritus

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.880
and Boskovich, and Schopenhauer and Spinoza I think will make appearances to you, special

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.100
guest appearances.

01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:51.560
Because what comes out of this, which we've only barely touched on, is an attempt at a

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:54.440
scientific theory to the will to power.

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.880
And so, the next episode is all about that, the world as will to power, and nothing besides.

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.080
So I'm excited, we're getting into, I like that we've gotten into more obscure stuff

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:13.260
now, and I guess this was another long episode, but you know, it's just gotta go until it's

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:15.020
finished, I guess.

01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:18.580
Alright, so join me again next week, y'all.

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:21.580
Alright, signing off.

01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:28.900
Quote, of all the more ancient systems, the Democritian is of the greatest consequence.

01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:33.500
The most rigorous necessity is presupposed in all things.

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:37.800
There are no sudden or strange violations of nature's course.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:46.040
Now for the first time, the collective anthropomorphic mythic view of the world has been overcome.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:52.520
Now for the first time, do we have a rigorous scientific useful hypothesis?

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:57.240
As such, materialism has always been of the greatest utility.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:00.560
It is the most down-to-earth point of view.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.980
It proceeds from real properties of matter, and it does not indifferently leave out the

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:13.740
simplest forces, as is done by accounts of mind, or that of final ends by Aristotle.

01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:19.820
It is a grand idea, this entire world of order and purposiveness, of countless qualities

01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:26.540
to be traced back to externalizations of one force of the most basic sort.

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:33.940
Matter, moving itself according to general laws, produces a blind, mechanistic result,

01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:39.240
which appears to be the outline of a highest wisdom.

01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.180
End quote.

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:48.280
That was Nietzsche from his lecture on Democritus in the pre-plotonic lecture series.

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:54.200
Democritus was the philosopher of ancient Greece who coined the term Adam, for the concept

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:57.180
of the smallest unit of matter.

01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:02.300
Democritus asserted that all matter was made up of forms constructed of smaller units,

01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:05.060
and the smallest of these were atoms.

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:11.820
Through strictly naturalistic processes, atoms interact, and from a totally blind nature

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:17.140
we get all of the movements and emergent phenomena that we experience in reality.

01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:22.420
And so here we see, in Nietzsche's estimation, the significance of Democritus, the first

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:29.240
truly materialistic or purely materialistic natural philosopher, who overcomes all of

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:33.560
these mythic personifications of the world, and all of these appeals to a non-mechanistic

01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:40.200
first cause, or metaphysical forces such as love or hate, such as what had been introduced

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:43.360
by previous figures in their explanations of the world.

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:49.760
Democritus doesn't have to introduce a moral or metaphysical element to explain existence,

01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:52.740
as, for example, Empedocles did before him.

01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:58.380
He does not have to appeal to Noose, the element of there being some underlying intellect governing

01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:05.380
the world, as we see in, for example, Annexagoras, who also preceded Democritus.

01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:12.660
Annexagoras sometimes has to invoke a divine intellect as an explanation, even though he

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:18.120
was driving, along with the other pre-plotonic philosophers, towards this sort of methodological

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:20.520
materialism.

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:27.520
In Democritus, as Nietzsche interprets him, the Greeks reach a zenith of materialism,

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:34.120
and this is what he designates as a mathematical atomism.

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:39.400
In this, all qualitative descriptions can be put into quantities.

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.260
All movement of the universe occurs without the need of an intelligence, and this opens

01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:50.180
up the possibility for science to branch off down its various paths.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:54.220
Nietzsche here acknowledges the power, the utility of atomism as a framework for understanding

01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:59.380
the world, and he believes that atomism is the direction in which the science of his

01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:02.500
own day was proceeding.

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:08.700
But notice another element in Nietzsche's words about Democritus, something he sees

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.720
in Democritus is very fascinating in light of Nietzsche's own ideas, which he would

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:18.200
not fully describe until much later in his career.

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.740
He clearly shows an interest in the grand idea, as he calls it, of an entire world being

01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:29.240
called forth in all of its infinite complexities from a single force.

01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:34.480
Indeed, throughout the pre-plotonic lectures, Nietzsche believes that the Greek drive to

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:41.500
philosophy revealed that underlying the philosophical project is a will to bound the world within

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.620
as few first principles as possible.

01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:51.600
The zenith of that attempt is therefore a single principle.

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.960
This was the task of the philosopher in the days of the pre-plotonics, when science and

01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:02.460
philosophy were still unified to explain reality by as few possible laws.

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:07.920
And so can Nietzsche dare to undertake such a task in his own time, of finding a single

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.460
force to explain the entirety of existence, from which all the other principles can be

01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:13.460
derived.

01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:19.900
Think the spark of that idea occurs here, and note again that this is a materialist endeavor

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:20.900
for Nietzsche.

01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:27.900
He does not conceive of this quest as in itself necessarily metaphysical, because like Democritus,

01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:33.660
he does not reach into the heavens for explanations wherever there is a gap, but rather attempts

01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:38.220
to explain the physical solely by means of the physical.

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:42.500
Nietzsche's own attempt culminates with the concept of will to power.

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:47.820
Will to power is the single principle, formula, law, or force, whatever we want to call it,

01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:51.380
by which Nietzsche will attempt to explain the entire world.

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:56.580
And while will to power need not be taken to this level, of this kind of perspective

01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:02.300
on it in order to be useful, I mean many people employ will to power simply as an ethical

01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:07.460
or psychological principle, including myself in many ways.

01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:15.300
But this strange intersection of will to power with the explanations for the physical world

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:17.980
is in the backdrop of Nietzsche's philosophy.

01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:24.580
And it's tied in with his odd theories of time and with his notion of the eternal recurrence.

01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:30.980
And it's been argued that will to power therefore first emerges for Nietzsche not in a moral

01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:39.860
or psychological aspect, but while he's in the process of examining scientific ideas.

01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:45.780
And you know, insofar as we may say that science itself is doing ontology, that's what he's

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:46.780
doing, right?

01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:51.260
So if we've abandoned the true world and we believe the ontological reality to be the

01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:58.540
material world that we all live in, in that sense you could say that Nietzsche is talking

01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:02.580
about will to power as a sort of ontological force.

01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:07.180
This idea comes with a million caveats, of course, and for all of those you can listen

01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:09.900
to the preceding episodes of the podcast.

01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:16.020
For today, however, the topic is Nietzsche's scientific influences for the idea of will

01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:23.260
to power and will to power as an explanatory principle within physics or within the context

01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:25.820
of thinking about physics.

01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:28.660
Can we make any sense of will to power in this sense?

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.060
Does it have any use for us for, you know, today?

01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:37.860
And can understanding this scientific angle on the will to power give us any insight into

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:44.100
the other nuances of Nietzsche's philosophy, and I would say that it does.

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:48.540
It's not required that you listen to the previous episode, Descent into Materialism, but I'll

01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.260
just say at this point, you probably will get more out of this one if you listen to

01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:58.220
that one first, since it gives a lot of context for the way Nietzsche thinks and how his philosophy

01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:03.740
of science compares and contrasts with previous views of science.

01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:09.100
But just as a summary, I guess, a brief synopsis, Nietzsche's heavily influenced by neocontine

01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:12.420
interpretations of the history of science.

01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:16.860
He draws as much insight from the pre-plotonic philosophers of ancient Greece as he does

01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.420
from contemporary figures.

01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:24.720
And finally, Nietzsche is himself very much engaged in a dialogue with the sciences and

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:30.820
addressing himself to ideas about the philosophy of science proposed by the great philosophers

01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:33.260
that came before him.

01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:36.580
And so more than anything, if you didn't listen to that talk, the most important thing to

01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:40.580
know is that Nietzsche was very much up to date on the developments in the sciences.

01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:45.740
He was very concerned with the philosophy of science, and rather than being an irrationalist,

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:51.300
he sees himself, at least in his early career, as being a scientific materialist.

01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:57.300
Now, of course, some of his later statements might actually contradict that, but nevertheless,

01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:02.620
I think that is how he understood his idea of will to power at this point, as coming

01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:08.420
out of a dialectic between past materialist philosophers of science.

01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:13.580
And the funny thing here is, I can't call it dialectical materialism, because Marxists

01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:16.820
have claimed that particular designation.

01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:21.540
But what we're talking about here is quite literally a dialogue, a dialectical development

01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:29.380
of a view of the world occurring between materialists in a scientific sense.

01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:34.740
And we could say that today, almost all scientists are the product of this dialectic, and so

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:39.620
far as they're all mostly materialists, at least again, in a methodological sense.

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:46.020
Sure, there are some oddballs out there who profess panpsychism and similar things, but

01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:50.180
in Nietzsche's time, not everyone was materialist.

01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:58.460
And so that's why it's important to zero in on the fact that it is this materialist branch

01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:02.740
of neocontain philosophy that's most influential in Nietzsche's thinking here, and that there

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.900
were actually other options out there at the time.

01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:10.420
And we'll get into those a little bit as we continue.

01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:18.460
Again, we find Friedrich Albert Lange, who wrote the History of Materialism, is a key

01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:21.180
influence on Nietzsche's thought.

01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:26.260
We talked a lot about Lange last time as sort of guiding Nietzsche through understanding

01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:29.380
the pre-plotonic philosophers.

01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:35.180
I thought I'd read some quotations here that more straightforwardly established that link

01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:39.340
and help support the case for this week's talk, that Democritus of all people would

01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:43.400
be a main influence on Nietzsche and his will to power idea.

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:47.860
But when we examine how Democritus is treated in Lange's work, this interpretation comes

01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:49.700
together very nicely.

01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:56.140
So in any case, George J. Stack noted that Nietzsche said that Lange's book, History

01:59:56.140 --> 02:00:04.060
of Materialism, was a, quote, treasure chest of ideas presented to him, end quote.

02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:10.300
This recalls Whitehead's phrasing that Plato's work is an inexhaustible mine of suggestion.

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:13.460
For Nietzsche, he found that in Lange.

02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:20.380
And so Nietzsche wrote in 1866, quote, the most significant philosophical work to appear

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:25.820
in the last decade is without a doubt Lange, History of Materialism, about which I could

02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:31.620
write voluminous praise, Kant, Schopenhauer, and this book by Lange.

02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:35.500
I do not need more than that, end quote.

02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:41.000
Now of course, Nietzsche would expand beyond those influences such as Kant and Schopenhauer,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.780
and he would therefore expand beyond Lange as well.

02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:48.980
But while Schopenhauer's name, for example, comes up all the time when we talk about Nietzsche's

02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:52.300
influences, Lange hardly comes up at all.

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:56.900
And so that's one of the reasons why I think it's important to emphasize him throughout

02:00:56.900 --> 02:01:00.940
this sort of detour into Nietzschean science we're doing here at the end of the season,

02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:06.660
because he's so explanatory of Nietzsche's thinking on this.

02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:12.100
So again, when it comes to Nietzsche's interpretation of Democritus, Democritus is central to Lange's

02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:13.100
book.

02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:18.260
While Lange mentions the other pre-Socratic philosophers, or pre-Platonics as Nietzsche

02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:24.780
calls them, Democritus gets far more attention from Lange than any other among the pre-Socratics.

02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:30.420
And as a matter of fact, Lange's book actually begins with a chapter entitled, The Early

02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:35.060
Atomists, Especially Democritus.

02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:39.380
Not only does this discussion of Democritus begin the work, but Democritus plays a central

02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:43.740
role in the entire book for Lange.

02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:49.420
Lange asserts in that work, quote, the modern atomic theory has been gradually developed

02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:53.980
from the atomism of Democritus, end quote.

02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:56.460
Centrality of Democritus is the main pre-Socratic figure.

02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:59.780
It was sort of shared in the viewpoint of Zeller.

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:02.780
We talked a little bit about Zeller last time.

02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:08.500
He's a semi-Hegelian philologist with whom Nietzsche had some agreements and some disagreements.

02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:16.620
It's worth noting that for the pre-Platonic lectures, Nietzsche mostly critiques Zeller,

02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:21.300
but one of the only points of agreement that he finds is that Zeller is aligned with Lange

02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:26.020
when it comes to understanding the importance of Democritus.

02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:30.900
And so Democritus is the culmination of the Materials Project in Ancient Greece.

02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:36.140
He also presents us with another archetypal personality among the pre-Platonic philosophers.

02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:40.540
So if we'll remember Nietzsche sees, he thinks it's very important that the pre-Platonics

02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:47.980
emerge at a time before there's a definitive thing such as a school or cast of philosophers.

02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:51.700
And each of them has to sort of define what it means to be a philosopher on his own.

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:58.820
And so he presents all of them as this series of fascinating, unique personalities.

02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:02.820
And when it comes to Democritus, he's known as the laughing philosopher.

02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.980
He's often contrasted with Heraclitus, the philosopher who was associated with sadness

02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:08.900
and melancholy.

02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:14.500
And I personally might question these designations as maybe being a bit anachronistic.

02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:20.900
But nevertheless, this is the common picture, Democritus is the philosopher who laughs.

02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:26.180
And perhaps this is because Democritus praises cheerfulness in his own work.

02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:32.540
And so we have a presentation of a worldview which is, for the first time, scientific and

02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:37.780
more or less fully liberated from mythology, but this is done cheerfully by someone who

02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:42.220
meets this entirely material existence with a laugh.

02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:48.860
And so we cannot help but see something resembling a joyous science within the figure of Democritus.

02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:54.540
Well, Nietzsche probably got that coinage, the phrase, gay science or joyous science

02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:57.660
from Emerson.

02:03:57.660 --> 02:04:03.660
But Nietzsche's admiration for Democritus, for the Democratian approach to life and

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:09.000
to knowledge, that may have been one of the influences that sort of led to him to conceive

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.740
of the concept of such a gay science.

02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:18.300
And so not only does Nietzsche describe the atomism of Democritus as constituting this

02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:23.620
most consequential of all ancient theories, but furthermore, we see in Democritus and

02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:27.180
his forerunner, Lucipus, another innovation.

02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:32.340
They produce a perspectival theory of human experience in which we might recognize the

02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:39.220
prefiguration of the sort of phenomena, numinous, split of Kant, which influenced the scientific

02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:41.140
thinking of the Neocontians.

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:45.940
So Democritus' description of thought and of sensation are that images, or we might

02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:51.740
say representations, affect the body from outside or they stimulate the body from outside

02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:56.540
if there's an outside stimulus which is then transformed into an image.

02:04:56.540 --> 02:05:01.820
And that even the basis of thoughts themselves are images or representations, we might say.

02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:07.340
And so certainly Nietzsche would recognize, he recognizes the kinship here in this picture

02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:14.180
of cognition with Schopenhauer and the Neocontians, von Helmholtz and Longa.

02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:20.380
But we must turn to the most consequential aspect of Democritus.

02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:25.520
What is the atomism of Democritus, the man who gave us the very word atom, which we

02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:27.840
use to this day?

02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:32.000
In the atomic theory of Democritus, we have the idea of atoms as indivisible.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.400
They're indivisible units, they're the bedrock unit of matter, so naturally they're the point

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:45.480
at which particles of matter cannot be divided into any more parts.

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:51.480
Different forms of matter are simply different arrangements of atoms or different shapes that

02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:54.760
exist in different positions in space.

02:05:54.760 --> 02:06:00.600
These are all constructed of atoms, and when bodies perish, the atoms in them disassemble,

02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:06.400
but the atoms themselves are not created or destroyed, so we have conservation of matter.

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:12.080
And furthermore, Democritus sees atoms as moving entirely in accord with laws governing

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:19.480
weight, so they don't undergo, they're completely explained by mechanistic processes, they don't

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:26.000
undergo direct contact, and action at a distance does not occur.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.640
Now of course, this means there's an inevitable split or separation between what we perceive

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:36.680
through the senses and what actually exists, sort of the hallmark of Greek philosophy,

02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:37.680
right?

02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:43.200
And that would seem to be required furthermore by the Democritian account of perception and

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.560
cognition.

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:50.680
So if there are these units of matter that are so small, we cannot see them with enough

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:55.040
specificity to see the boundaries between them, such a difference between what we perceive

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.400
and what the world truly is would seem to be required, right?

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:05.320
And so nevertheless, we can still say that there's something different has occurred here,

02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:10.120
though, just to push back on that, that this is not quite the distinction between perception

02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:16.000
and knowledge of the type held by, say, Plato or the Christians, in which true knowledge

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:21.400
of the world sort of reveals forces and principles which transcend the material world.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:26.680
Democritus still holds some methodological materialism, as we've called it.

02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:30.720
It's merely, you know, the difference between perception and the true world, quote unquote,

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.640
in the case of Democritus, would be the equivalent in modern times to like the difference between

02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:40.680
what one sees with their eyes, with the naked eye, versus what one sees through an electron

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:41.680
microscope, right?

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:46.360
Unless we're going to say that what we see through the microscope constitutes a metaphysical

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:51.800
world, which I don't think most people would, then we can excuse Democritus on this.

02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:55.200
And it's worth noting that later scientific discovery backs up what he said.

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:58.600
We do see smaller and smaller building blocks.

02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:04.240
And so Democritus has been vindicated, although I should say the term used for Adam in the

02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:10.360
modern day doesn't really correspond to Adam's, as Democritus described them, since the Adam

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:15.260
is by definition the smallest possible unit of matter.

02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:20.440
So once you start talking about subatomic particles, you're using the word in a different

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:25.440
way than Democritus would have understood it, right, just by definition there.

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:33.560
So furthermore, also, Democritus is not perfect in every sense as a materialist.

02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:39.480
For example, he permits that between atoms of matter exist atoms of soul, and soul is

02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:46.000
conceived as a kind of invigorating force, which Whitlock asserts might serve the function

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:52.800
of being a prefiguration of the will to power, a prefiguration in the mind of Nietzsche.

02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:59.120
The atoms of soul are almost more like a field than what we would consider to be solid matter.

02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:06.880
But remember, materialism doesn't mean that things like energy don't exist.

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:11.540
Perhaps we could see the Democritian view as sort of like a low resolution understanding

02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:14.680
that there has to be some sort of energy in the system.

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.240
So it's still a material explanation.

02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:22.280
And the other component in how Nietzsche thinks about will to power scientifically might have

02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:27.680
been influenced by precursors to field theory, right?

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:32.360
And so he's maybe able to interpret Democritus in that way.

02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:38.880
In any case, Democritus does have to account for mind, and for consciousness, and movement.

02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:44.680
And what all this ends up being is yet another form of material, of matter.

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:50.560
And that's very different from how Heraclitus or Anaxagoras or Empedocles might see something

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:53.160
like mind or spirit.

02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:59.800
And so in a passage from Longa, he expresses this aspect of Democritus as one of the triumphs

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:01.480
of his natural philosophy.

02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:03.880
Longa writes, quote,

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:11.000
Democritus regarded mind not as the world-building force, but only as one form of matter amongst

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.560
others.

02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:17.700
And this is just Democritus's superiority for every philosophy which seriously attempts

02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:22.240
to understand the phenomenal world must come back to this point.

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:27.880
The special case of those processes we call intellectual must be explained from the universal

02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:32.120
laws of motion, or we have no explanation at all.

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.400
But he who devises some bungling explanation of nature, including the rational actions

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:43.600
of mankind, starting from mere conjectural, a priori notions, which is it is impossible

02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:49.240
for the mind to picture intelligibly to itself, destroys the whole basis of science, no matter

02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:53.240
whether he be called Aristotle or Hegel.

02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:59.000
Good old Kant would here undoubtedly in principle declare himself on the side of Democritus

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:05.240
and against Aristotle and Zeller, end quote.

02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:09.680
So maybe that passage started out rather clear, but then he starts talking about all these

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.680
other figures.

02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:13.320
So let's clarify this passage a little bit.

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:17.640
Well, the first thing we might bring up in clarifying the passage further, there's one

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:22.440
of Nietzsche's unpublished notes that Whitlock references.

02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:28.720
But Whitlock references this note without a citation, only to call it overlooked and cryptic,

02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.120
which is funny because he himself overlooked the citation.

02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:34.040
So I don't know where to find this in Nietzsche's work.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:38.960
But according to Whitlock, Nietzsche wrote that his intellectual heritage is derived

02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:46.160
from anti-teleological spinosists on the one hand and mechanists on the other.

02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:51.200
And I think that's justifiably a rather cryptic remark because Nietzsche says he may be understood

02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:54.280
properly only in this context.

02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:59.240
And that's a very, you know, on the face of it, that's a strange origin story for Nietzsche's

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:04.520
intellectual tradition for he himself to give.

02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:08.920
I mean, it would probably sound strange to pretty much anyone who hasn't looked into

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:14.120
this angle of Nietzsche's thought, his philosophy of science, right?

02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:22.520
But so when he invokes spinosists, obviously that refers to Spinoza, Baruch Spinoza was

02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:26.720
a philosopher from the 17th century.

02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:32.160
He was from Amsterdam, or he lived in Amsterdam, but he was of a Sephardic Jewish origin.

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:35.680
And he's one of the leading figures among the rationalists.

02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.560
And he crafted a worldview in which mankind and the world as we know it, and even God

02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.720
are viewed from a sort of naturalistic lens.

02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:46.160
And Nietzsche had great respect for Spinoza.

02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:49.560
He called him a precursor to his own ideas.

02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:55.040
And one similarity we'll immediately see when we compare Nietzsche and Spinoza, for example,

02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.080
is that both reject the existence of free will, at least in the way free will is normally

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:01.240
presented.

02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:08.120
Spinoza's rejection of Descartes' mind-body dualism also aligns Spinoza with Nietzsche's

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:10.480
outlook, right?

02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:17.680
But Spinoza had caused something, he had caused a mighty controversy called either the Spinozist

02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:21.560
controversy or the Pantheism controversy.

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:29.680
This emerges in the German philosophical circles, in the academic and philosophical circles.

02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:35.680
This is because Spinoza had been a pantheist, and he had thus seen God as the effective

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:37.960
force in all things.

02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:43.480
This picture of the world was therefore naturalistic, but not really materialist, I mean it's dependent

02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:46.920
on the power of an ever-present divine force.

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:52.360
It's less personal in Spinoza's view than the traditional Christian view, something

02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:55.320
more akin to a force or a field, right?

02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:01.920
But it's nevertheless associated with God, and as an imminent, all-encompassing divinity.

02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:07.960
So what came with the popularity of Spinozistic metaphysics in the German intellectual circles

02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:14.240
was a tendency towards teleologist positions on science.

02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:15.240
What does that mean?

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:20.440
It means, even though there's a genuine attempt to understand the world, via natural law,

02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:26.960
this is still done within a framework in which the world exists for some purpose.

02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:30.760
Also, and that's what atelos means, is a purpose.

02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:36.560
So it's still done within a framework in which the world exists for the sake of some divine

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:43.000
force, for the purpose crafted by an absolute mind, or whatever the case might be.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.440
And this goes all the way back to Aristotle, a teleology for the world in the Aristotelian

02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:50.560
sense.

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:55.720
It implies that the reality we live in and experience as a contingent reality, subject

02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:58.280
to some other dominant reality.

02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:02.760
If this life exists for some purpose or ends, that means there's some other thing whose

02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:09.760
end it serves, whether that's another world or this imminent divine intellect or whatever.

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:17.960
And so that claim of a teleological universe became very popular in Germany, and then there

02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:19.760
was a backlash to this.

02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:25.240
There arose an anti-teleologist camp among German intellectuals, and this even included

02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:27.280
many Spinozists.

02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:32.880
They took influence from Spinoza's ideas, but nevertheless came down against teleology.

02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:40.680
And so these are the anti-teleological Spinozists that Nietzsche references.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:47.680
In that quotation we just looked at from Longa, he sort of implies what this divide is.

02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:51.800
He shows us the divide and who he's talking about, right, between the teleologists and

02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:53.680
the anti-teleologists.

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.800
Also he brings up Aristotle, and he groups him together with Hegel.

02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:05.800
These are examples of thinkers who had teleological explanations of nature, Aristotle's inclusion,

02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:11.440
rather obvious, Hegel's included here, also rather obviously, Hegel sees life and history

02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:13.560
as a revelation of the absolute.

02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:18.720
So for Hegel, life and history, therefore, have a telos, which is the revelation of the

02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:23.400
absolute mind to itself, or however, you know, I'd love to have a Hague alien on, if anyone

02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:28.880
knows a good Hague alien, you know, maybe, I don't, I mean, I know of them, right?

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:34.640
I know Gizek and things like that, but I don't know any good Hague alien philosophers who

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:36.320
are like popular.

02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.000
So if you know one, let me know.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.280
But anyway, that's just an aside.

02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:47.000
So Zeller, for his Hague alienism, he's included as another candidate, as an opposing figure

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:53.240
to the worldview of Longa, who comes down on this anti-teleological side, right?

02:16:53.240 --> 02:17:01.360
So Zeller, as we mentioned, somewhat Hague alien, so he's included with Hegel and Aristotle.

02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.520
Now on the anti-teleologist side, Longa suggests Kant would stand over on his side of the question,

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:12.600
on his side of the aisle, and that would also be the side of Democritus.

02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:17.320
And we could recall the passage we quoted from last week from Kant, where Kant sort

02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:22.640
of delights in the prospect that one could give him matter and he could give you a world

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:23.800
from it, right?

02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:28.880
That simply applying his reason to understanding the laws and patterns governing matter and

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:34.480
its interactions with the world, you could start with the universe in a chaotic, unformed

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:39.480
state of just one kind of thing, one kind of matter, one form, a fundamental form of

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.920
matter and Kant can give you a world out of it, right?

02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:46.000
That's exactly what Democritus did.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:55.120
So it makes Kant, Democritus, Longa, and yes, Nietzsche in the camp, which is anti-teleological.

02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:01.680
So Nietzsche, accordingly, in his pre-plutonic lectures, draws the comparison between Democritus

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:03.560
and Kant.

02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:08.400
So and since Longa drew that same comparison, we could conclude this is another thing he

02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:16.400
possibly gets from Longa, that we might be seeing Longa's influence in that very passage.

02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:21.680
And so when Nietzsche says in this cryptic note that anti-teleological spinosists are

02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:29.640
one camp from which he descends intellectually, these would be figures like Longa and Ubreveg,

02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:35.400
who were influenced by Spinoza, but rejected Spinoza's idea of a telos for the world.

02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:39.040
And then the other people who would easily say are mechanists, and so we might just say

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:47.120
people who would, this would include anyone who has anti-teleological views or methodologically

02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:53.240
anti-teleological views, especially those who existed even prior to Spinoza, and so figures

02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:56.560
like Bacon, Kant, and of course, Democritus.

02:18:56.560 --> 02:19:01.320
And so another quote from Longa puts this even more directly, again, this is from history

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:07.440
of materialism, quote, Aristotle complains repeatedly that Democritus, leaving aside

02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:12.920
teleological causes, had explained everything by a necessity of nature.

02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:17.880
This is exactly what Bacon praises most strongly in his book on the advancement of learning,

02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:18.880
end quote.

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.920
And so of course, Longa agrees with Bacon and not Aristotle.

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:29.000
And it demonstrates in the way how Bacon praises Democritus for the very same thing

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.180
that Aristotle criticizes.

02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:36.920
It reveals that dichotomy, anti-teleological thinking versus teleological.

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:43.160
And so Longa suggests where Democritus may have been lacking, and this I think provides

02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:47.800
an area in which Nietzsche sees a way that he can innovate.

02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:55.040
And so Longa writes, quote, of all the great principles underlying materialism in our time,

02:19:55.040 --> 02:20:01.000
one only is wanting and Democritus, and that is the abolition of all teleology by the principle

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:06.480
of the development of the purposeful from the unpurposeful.

02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:12.640
We find in him no trace of that false teleology, which may be described as the hereditary foe

02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:19.640
of all science, but we discover nowhere an attempt to explain the origin of these adaptations

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:24.520
from the blind sway of natural necessity, end quote.

02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:32.020
And so Longa argues, the only true refutation of a teleology for the world, you know, the

02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:36.360
refutation of the world having a purpose and intelligence or like some sort of world-building

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:44.200
mind, it would be to show how purpose can arise from purposelessness.

02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:48.440
Because we as conscious beings, we have minds, we have consciousness.

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:51.080
We come up with concepts such as purpose.

02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:55.560
We create things that do have a telos, and we give a telos to things which we did not

02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:56.560
even create.

02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:01.720
So, you know, you craft something like a chair, which has a telos in its very creation, right?

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:08.280
The chair is for your sitting, but you could also use a tree stump to sit upon, right?

02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:14.160
And so it's the fact that we have this mind which not only perceives things, but also imparts

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:20.480
a purpose to things according to what we value or need or prefer.

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:25.800
And so a materialist understanding is confronted, I mean, in some sense you could reduce it

02:21:25.800 --> 02:21:30.720
to what we today call the hard problem of consciousness, where you have to account for

02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:37.840
a mind which invents ideas like purpose, goal, and end, which means your materialist theory

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:43.720
ultimately has to take account of values, meaning, right?

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:49.680
A naturalistic theory which doesn't reach outside the world of matter that can provide

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:56.880
a meaning for mankind, or rather, more precisely, provides an explanation for how meaning arises,

02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:00.320
where it comes from, why we have a notion of it.

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:05.280
And that's, too long ago would be the only acceptable refutation of teleology, or the

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:08.240
only effective thing, the only thing that would really do the trick.

02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:15.280
And so that's an interesting clue, I think, if we take it seriously, as to what Nietzsche's

02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:18.400
philosophical project becomes aimed at.

02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:24.160
It's another way of seeing how these questions are opening up for Nietzsche as we keep going

02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:25.720
here.

02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:33.960
But by refusing to engage in teleology, admirable as that is, without really giving that explanation

02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:41.000
that Longus sees as essential, Democritus leaves his theories open to misinterpretation.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:46.160
Democritus believes that nothing is up to random chance, but as Longa notes, his materialist

02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:53.560
denial of final causes led some to misunderstand Democritus as ultimately preaching just such

02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:55.840
a belief in chance, right?

02:22:55.840 --> 02:23:01.840
And so a distinction has to be made between chance and necessity, which Nietzsche sees

02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:09.760
in Democritus's work, and on that basis sort of uses that to refute the people, refute

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:13.880
the interpretation of Democritus as simply believing in random chance by saying he doesn't

02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:16.760
believe in chance, he believes in necessity.

02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:21.840
And we could say maybe there's a, Nietzsche can see this in one of his other influences

02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:28.560
because Schopenhauer made this distinction between basing things on chance and basing

02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:32.280
things on the principle of sufficient reason.

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:39.780
And so Nietzsche also makes this distinction between chance and necessity here, or he's

02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:41.900
able to see it very clearly.

02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:45.920
And so through the influence of Longa and Nietzsche, we have a clear battle line, teleology

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:50.600
as the opposing force of science, and Longa's main critique of Democritus was that he rejected

02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:57.800
teleology, but he didn't adequately defeat it, we might say, by accounting for telos naturalistically,

02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:02.560
or for teloi as we encounter them, or as our minds come up with them.

02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:06.640
The process of teloi generation, we might say, right?

02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:10.000
What is the production of telos?

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Where does that come from?

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:17.640
And so Democritus sets the stage for future anti-teleologists, such as Nietzsche, to address

02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:19.640
this issue.

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:26.760
Whitlock writes, quote, Longa and Nietzsche nearly identified teleological reason with

02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:29.560
religious anthropomorphism.

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:35.560
Democritus' atomism rejecting teleology, if incompletely, his intellectual discovery

02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:42.480
laid the groundwork for the mathematical Pythagoreans, end quote.

02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:51.520
It's worth saying Nietzsche would later grow out of this position, or out of pure mechanism,

02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:52.720
we'll say.

02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:58.120
And it's very subtle, the change in mindset for Nietzsche, but it's difficult to place

02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:03.520
later Nietzsche within this solidly and completely mechanistic camp.

02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:10.720
And as his thought matured, he would later critique Longa and Ubreveg as being part of

02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:16.280
the, quote, Church of Materialism, end quote.

02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:21.880
And I think it's because Nietzsche eventually becomes skeptical and questions the whole

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:30.240
belief and cause and effect, which is, it's like almost a whole other can of worms, right?

02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:34.880
It's nevertheless still very instructive here, and we're thinking about what started Nietzsche

02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:38.920
down the road, thinking about many of his later ideas, to consider how the foundation

02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:44.560
was mechanistic, materialistic, anti-teleological.

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:49.440
That's why I would say he starts from a truly atheistic position, and I said he's the first

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:54.400
truly atheistic philosopher, or I characterized him that way, like way back in the first

02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:57.080
episode, as I recall correctly.

02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:03.240
So now, in discussing the often overlooked significance of Democritus to Nietzsche's

02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:09.360
philosophy, we have seen how Nietzsche's thought is so deferential to that, Friedrich

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:16.960
Albert Longa, that in some sense we can't even really compare the thoughts of the two,

02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:20.200
because the overlap is near total.

02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:26.840
But there was an aspect to Nietzsche's thought that went beyond Longa, and that is insofar

02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:33.720
as he brought in a scientist who was regarded at the time as an obscure, or even a fringe

02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:39.880
sort of figure, and that's the Croatian physicist, mathematician, and philosopher of

02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:44.000
science, Roger Josef Boskovich, I believe his name and his native tongue would be like

02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:50.040
Rogiero, but I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce Croatian, so.

02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:57.540
He lived and wrote in the 18th century, and his most famous work is published in 1758,

02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:03.880
Theory of Natural Philosophy, derived from a single law of forces which exist in nature,

02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:10.320
which contains Boskovich's atomic theory and his theory of forces.

02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:14.640
Boskovich was attractive to Nietzsche for a reason that would be very obvious in light

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:19.480
of our analysis of how Nietzsche has been thinking about the project of science, because

02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:28.040
Boskovich provided a single equation, a single force for describing how every different manifestation

02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:33.160
of force expresses itself in the physical world.

02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:39.400
And so, Boskovich's ideas, they actually did not find a wide purchase at the time when

02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:45.800
he was writing, but his place in science has been somewhat rejuvenated in recent years.

02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:52.080
There are some such as Dragoslav Stojlikovic, not exactly sure how to pronounce his name,

02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:59.560
but he's called Boskovich the father of modern science, and a sort of forerunner to the quantum

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:05.600
theory, or quantum physics, and all sorts of things.

02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:11.440
So, in bringing Boskovich into his thinking, Nietzsche parts ways with many of these figures

02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:15.200
that we've talked about as being his influences.

02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:20.000
Boskovich is the final element in Nietzsche's scientific thinking that we haven't yet covered,

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.040
and with Boskovich's help, Nietzsche goes beyond all his precursors.

02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:28.920
And Whitlock describes this, and I'm going to quote from his commentary on the lecture

02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:32.840
in an abridged form, quote,

02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:06.240
the only reasonable account of the phenomenal world, the problem of motion remains.

02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:12.400
This is crucial to note, Newton introduced the existence of God to explain the enigma

02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:14.200
of motion.

02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:19.560
For this reason, among others, Schopenhauer remarked that science solves enigmas only by

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:22.880
introducing occult terms.

02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:27.840
This agrees with constant action, of the a priori judgment God exists.

02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:35.200
Nietzsche knew well that motion is a physical enigma with profound metaphysical implications.

02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:40.920
One of Newton's contemporaries, Roger Boskovich, attempted to solve the enigma of motion outside

02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:47.480
the framework of Newtonian explanation via the principle of action at a distance.

02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:53.040
Schopenhauer decried this highly controversial principle as another occult force, whereas

02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:59.320
Kant saw it as a threat to both God and Newton, and so constructed the architectronic of his

02:29:59.320 --> 02:30:04.840
system in part as a bulwark against Boskovichian physics.

02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:09.880
This controversy around Boskovich was itself a dynamic and the larger cultural debate about

02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:15.200
spinosism, an encroaching materialistic atheism.

02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:20.800
Boskovich, although a devout Catholic, did not require God to explain motion in his system,

02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.520
as did Newton.

02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:28.160
For a quite similar reason, Leibnizian monodology was seen as a non-Newtonian alternative to

02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:33.920
Kantianism that avoided the Boskovichian point-particle system.

02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:41.200
Uberveg and Lange, following Hemholz, rejected Boskovich, in this way they decisively parted

02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:45.960
company with Nietzsche.

02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:49.800
He brings up Leibniz at the end there.

02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:51.600
We don't need to get into the specifics of that.

02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:56.280
Just to understand, he's sort of saying that Boskovichian physics was so controversial,

02:30:56.280 --> 02:31:02.480
so scary to people, because it could explain motion without appeal to God.

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:06.520
He alleges basically Kant sees it therefore as a threat to God, into the Newtonian system

02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:10.200
which appeals to God.

02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:15.840
Even if you must step outside of Newtonianism, well, here we've got Leibniz over here who

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:18.480
don't go to Boskovich, right?

02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:21.880
There's an alternative to that.

02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:25.640
Everyone had sort of avoided Boskovich because of this, and Whitlock seems to think that it's

02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:31.920
because there's this sort of undertone that with Boskovich, even though he's a Catholic,

02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:36.920
this encroaching materialistic atheism comes with his physics, because of what it has the

02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:38.440
power to do.

02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:43.520
Nietzsche became very excited by Boskovichian point-particle theory.

02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:50.720
Nietzsche's point-particles are not corpuscular atoms, or sorry, corpuscular atoms, as in

02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:56.320
the Newtonian system, which form the basis of Kant's understanding as well.

02:31:56.320 --> 02:32:02.720
Kant's matter is Newtonian matter, and it's made of these corpuscular atoms.

02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:08.880
Corpuscular atoms are extended, they're bodies, we might say.

02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:14.240
Force points, on the other hand, are non-extended, non-corpuscular.

02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:21.520
Unlike the Democartian atoms, or Newtonian atoms, Boskovichian force points do engage

02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:24.120
in action at a distance.

02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:29.600
They don't interpenetrate, and in fact, Boskovich mathematically demonstrated how they could

02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:36.200
both attract and repulse one another in accord with the same underlying mathematical principle.

02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:41.000
It's very fascinating, even though the math is very much beyond me.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:46.360
In Nietzsche's interpretation of Boskovich, the units that comprise what matter is are

02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:52.120
less like solid atoms, individual bodies, but more like a field.

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:56.200
And these fields are sort of made up of the interaction of force points, each could be

02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:01.640
called a quanta of power, or to speak the language of Nietzsche's later philosophy, a quanta

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:03.320
of will to power.

02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:09.040
And so will to power will become, in Nietzsche's philosophical retelling of Boskovichian physics,

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:15.480
this qualitative description of what Boskovich's math showed, that the world is endless points

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:20.720
of force, all acting and exerting against one another, and manifesting the way that they

02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:25.040
push against the other forces according to the distance that they act.

02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:30.080
Or we might say the scale at which the force manifests.

02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:37.680
And so Whitlock writes that in this way Nietzsche went beyond Spinoza, Kant, Lange, Uberweg,

02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:41.400
Helmholtz, and all the Newtonian mechanists.

02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:47.080
Whitlock writes, quote, Nietzsche sought to take the tradition another step further into

02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:53.560
point particle theory, and to what he would soon call his, quote, force point world, end

02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:56.160
quote.

02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:04.720
So by doing this, Nietzsche is trying to get over what you might call sort of like the

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:08.120
epistemological baggage he's picked up from his biggest influence.

02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:12.320
It's the transcendental idealism of Schopenhauer.

02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:18.480
And that sort of, we might say is inherited from the teleology of Spinoza.

02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:23.920
Nietzsche is trying to complete this vision of a strictly material world, which was first

02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:29.680
abdumbrated by democratists, you know, he gave us the rough outline.

02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:35.480
But Nietzsche knows that his biggest influence philosophically, Schopenhauer, can't help

02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:39.320
him here because Schopenhauer is not a materialist.

02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:45.640
And so Nietzsche has to therefore avoid the objections to materialism that figures such

02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.120
as Schopenhauer had raised.

02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:52.160
Schopenhauer used an argument that is very logical.

02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:57.720
If one operates from the first principle set by Kant, which Schopenhauer accepts, the

02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:02.160
starting premise of this argument is that we never directly experience a mind independent

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:08.120
reality and that everything we experience is just a representation.

02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:13.640
Schopenhauer's argument is that then that means the atoms themselves are only a representation.

02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:17.080
It's something I sort of referenced last week when we were talking, I referenced Donald

02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:18.080
Hoffman last week.

02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:22.880
I think I called him David Hoffman, which was just a genuine mistake, but I looked it up

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:24.960
and his name is actually Donald David Hoffman.

02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:30.240
So congrats to me because I technically didn't misname him.

02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:36.680
But Hoffman remarks upon his realization as a neurologist that looking at a neuron is

02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:38.960
sort of like looking at a pixel.

02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.200
It's the mind's representation.

02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:43.520
It's a placeholder for something out there in reality.

02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:45.360
It's not the reality itself.

02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:49.240
So Schopenhauer essentially makes the same argument about the atom.

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:55.440
And even if you find the bedrock unit of matter, from which you hope to explain all material

02:35:55.440 --> 02:36:02.040
things, all material processes, you're still just explaining it by way of representation.

02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:08.960
And that the representation is something indirectly given as Schopenhauer puts it, right?

02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:10.280
It's not the fundamental reality.

02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.000
It's just a symbol of it.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:17.320
And so attempting to explain reality by way of representation is compared to Munchausen

02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:21.760
pulling himself up out of the marsh by pulling out on his own suspenders, right?

02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:25.640
Or in some versions of the myth, it's by his hair.

02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:29.880
It's where we get the phrase pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, right?

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:33.640
It's something that can't be done.

02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:39.440
Longa carried on this idea of representation from Kant just as Schopenhauer had done.

02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:46.640
But he became open to Schopenhauer's arguments against materialism because Longa wished to

02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:49.960
account for representation through the physiology.

02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:58.920
He's giving a physiological and thus a materialistic accounting of what representation is, right?

02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:05.000
Because obviously if the physiology produces representations and the physiology is itself

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:10.080
known to us through representations we have of it, aren't we assuming what we're trying

02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:16.040
to prove by appealing to physiology as the explanation, right, for representation?

02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:21.760
And so your mind can kind of get tied in knots if you think about this too much.

02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:26.040
Longa devotes a great deal of his history of materialism to reconcile these contradictions

02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:29.000
and defend materialism as a solid grounding for science.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.640
He took the time to really take Schopenhauer's philosophical arguments seriously and try

02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:36.000
and rebut them.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:41.840
And so Nietzsche was content to let Longa's arguments on that front do his work for him.

02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:47.000
And maybe the simplest way to say this without getting too bogged down on this issue is that

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.320
I sort of paraphrase the argument from Nietzsche himself last week.

02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:54.240
We can't take the representation as the most fundamental thing because it would mean that

02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:58.440
our sense organs are themselves the representations of our organs.

02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:03.600
And so it doesn't seem that we actually gain anything by appealing to the framework of

02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:09.160
representation in order to object to materialism, right?

02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:12.480
At best that would just be an argument that we can't make statements about the basis of

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:15.640
reality as it transcends the human mind.

02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:19.640
But supposing we take it as a given that that's not what science is doing, that we're making

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:24.560
statements about the phenomenal world as we experience it, then there's really no problem.

02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:25.760
And that's what science is doing.

02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:32.240
So materialism, I think, Longa is correct, can serve as a basis for science.

02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:39.320
And Schopenhauer's metaphysical objections to that are a bit sort of, I don't know, they're

02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:40.920
a bit old and contrived.

02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:48.040
And Nietzsche feels he can get over Schopenhauer's metaphysical objections and therefore fully

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:53.240
go all in on the materialist project and use Boskovich to complete it.

02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:58.800
And Whitlock summarizes, quote, Nietzsche could rest assured that Schopenhauer's old

02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:04.120
metaphysical arguments alone would not refute materialism, whereas Friedrich Albert Longa

02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:08.960
stood between Kant and materialism, however Nietzsche went beyond both by rejecting their

02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:15.160
shared presuppositions of extended Newtonian matter of the corpuscular atom.

02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:20.040
To do so, he embraced the iconoclastic thought of someone rejected by both Kant and Longa,

02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:25.600
namely Boskovich, and thus, at the end of his lecture on Democritus, Nietzsche soundly

02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:32.120
dismisses Schopenhauer's argument and accepts Longa's materialism as a provisional hypothesis

02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:36.600
until theoretical emendations can be made, end quote.

02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:43.680
And so the way in which Nietzsche is influenced is interesting, but just as much so the way

02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:48.320
Nietzsche goes against prior figures in the history of science is at least as informative

02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:52.120
for our purposes.

02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:57.040
Nietzsche believed that in Boskovich, therefore, he's overcome the problem of motion, which

02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:03.240
obtained in the Newtonian and Kantian model, and had prompted Schopenhauer to say that

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:09.840
scientific explanations always reach for occult forces, explanations which are not themselves

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:18.480
explicable, and this problem dates back to Spinoza's own deus ex machina of using God

02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:21.040
to shore up the hypothesis.

02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:27.760
Spinoza, the language he uses, he drew upon the concept which originates in classical antiquity

02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:32.720
and had been used by Descartes as well of Canatus.

02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:38.600
Canatus is defined as a tendency within bodies for movement.

02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:44.440
Obviously we can't stop there with our definition because that would be a just so argument.

02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:49.760
It's an argument by definition, like the very thing Schopenhauer's criticizing as just

02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.960
being an occult force or the way Nietzsche criticizes Kant for saying that we can have

02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:59.400
synthetic a priori knowledge by virtue of a faculty.

02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:01.640
You're just sort of defining it into existence.

02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:04.800
So what is the explanation for Canatus?

02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:07.280
What is it on a fundamental level?

02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:13.640
And when we get right down to it, it's an expression of the power of God is how Spinoza

02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:15.360
can explain it.

02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:21.840
His conception of Canatus sees it as an inherent aspect within physical bodies, driving them

02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:25.760
towards movement, and that it expresses the power of God.

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:33.240
And furthermore, he specifies that it constitutes a striving, particularly a striving to exist,

02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:39.600
and that the striving constituted the actual essence of individual phenomena.

02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:43.400
And so if this sounds like Schopenhauer's philosophy, we can see the definite parallels

02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:47.480
and Schopenhauer's conception of the will to live.

02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:54.200
Will in Schopenhauer's philosophy is, if not teleological, a sort of metaphysical explanation

02:41:54.320 --> 02:42:00.640
for reality, which appeals to something not given by empirical experiment.

02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:06.880
Schopenhauer, if not a teleologist, you know, he's a transcendental idealist, and he's

02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:10.120
thus opposed to the project of materialism, as we've said.

02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:14.600
And so the atheistic Schopenhauer is still perfectly willing to say that all things have

02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:22.360
an essence, an inner character, which is universal and merely expresses itself in different manifestations,

02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:25.640
which is defined by Schopenhauer as will.

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:29.560
Canatus is a clear influence on the idea of will.

02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:31.120
It's also an inner essence.

02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:33.880
It's a striving to exist.

02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:39.240
And so Schopenhauer, just as Spinoza, is defiant towards any attempt to reduce his conception

02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:44.400
to purely material explanations.

02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:49.000
Nietzsche's leap from Democritus to Boskovich is the way Nietzsche sees it.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.760
It's a resolution to the problem.

02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:54.720
There's always been that gap into which God flows.

02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:57.080
God flows into science, right?

02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:03.960
And so while Nietzsche, maybe something instructive here is that Nietzsche considered the eliatics,

02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:09.240
like Parmenides and Zeno, to be a dead end in the development of Greek scientific thought.

02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:16.800
But they are instructive to us in that way, insofar as they deal with the problem of motion

02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:21.360
by denying it altogether, right?

02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:23.560
He says that motion is an illusion.

02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:31.480
Zeno, in his famous paradox, shows how motion, when rendered into quantity, becomes absurd.

02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:36.320
Its infinite divisibility makes nonsense of our own conception of movement in the passage

02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:37.320
of time.

02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:45.320
So motion is so problematic that some philosophers just deny that it's real, since it was unreasonable

02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:47.000
for it to exist.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.480
And so this is, you know, to Nietzsche, it's a dead end, because it doesn't really get

02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:56.640
us any closer to reckoning with the reality of the phenomenal world as we experience it.

02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:01.640
And so, in the history of science and the history of philosophy, we've marched on in

02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:06.360
spite of the absurdity of motion, always, even if we have to account for it by making

02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:09.240
reference to God.

02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:12.920
Something not dissimilar to Parmenides is a conception of true being.

02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:19.920
We have to make reference to this static, eternal, unchanging reality, God in the machine,

02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:26.000
making the machine function, either as a first cause or as pantheism or whatever.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.480
And so what's happened here is that our final explanations are not rational.

02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:33.920
Our accounting of the physical world doesn't rise to the standards of what's permissible

02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:35.400
as a rational explanation.

02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:42.400
And so Whitlock writes that Nietzsche, quote, acquired what we might call his second order

02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:44.400
theory of truth.

02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:48.960
This second order principle requires that all first order theories be only representations

02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:55.120
within a deeper underlying will, so that an adequate theory of matter must understand

02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:00.720
matter as a representation of will and not as a thing in itself.

02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:05.320
Note that this still allows work on a first order theory of nature, but only within the

02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:09.360
confines of the second order theory of theories.

02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:14.240
Nietzsche believed that a great leap, even a revolution as grand as that of Copernicus,

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:20.200
would be affected if a first order theory were to abandon Newtonian corpuscular atomism

02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:24.880
and shift paradigms to a force point conception of the world.

02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:30.240
Boscovician point particle theory overturned the Newtonian spinosist paradigm of extended

02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:36.600
matter, bringing first order theory of nature into line with second order principles.

02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.420
By reinterpreting Schopenhauer's notion of will, originally derived from Spinoza's

02:45:41.420 --> 02:45:48.120
idea of Cognitus, in terms of an extended force point, all spinosistic metaphysics,

02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:52.640
even substance, would be rendered useless.

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:58.920
Like Kant, Nietzsche would then be in a position to create the world from an unordered chaos,

02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:04.240
a world as will to power.

02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:09.360
So here we have it, Nietzsche's will to power is, in one sense, a response to centuries

02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:14.760
of debates in the philosophy of science, an attempt to philosophize about the world in

02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:21.240
such a way that is adequately reflective of the force point world of Boscovitch, which

02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:26.840
to Nietzsche is the only way to understand the world materialistically in a consistent

02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:34.400
manner, in which our theories and our principles completely align and shift things away from

02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:41.880
the stubborn teleology of Spinoza, the deus ex machina of Kant and Newton into a pure materialism

02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:48.360
described by a single force that merely manifests itself in various phenomenal forms.

02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:53.520
In other words, Nietzsche is talking about a fundamental will, and this is what Boscovitch's

02:46:53.640 --> 02:47:00.160
single mathematical principle represents to Nietzsche, that fundamental will in a quantitative

02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:02.360
form.

02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:05.680
Here's another quotation from Whitlock, quote,

02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:11.080
The anti-teleological motives on Nietzsche's part suggest not that he was a nihilist seeking

02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:16.680
to enlist science in his campaign against religion, but rather that he was already searching

02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:23.120
for his own scientific hypothesis, one that would prove anathema to the real nihilists,

02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.600
those Europeans who all still clung to a belief in God.

02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:33.720
He found the scientific vision to be exhilarating and associated it with the tragic Heraklitean-Dianisian

02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:37.800
perspective he had discovered philologically.

02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:47.060
It proved to him a source of pessimism out of strength, not nihilism, end quote.

02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:52.480
So as we talked about last time, these lecture notes on the pre-platonics speak to a deep

02:47:52.520 --> 02:48:00.000
scientific interest, and throughout the pre-platonic lectures, we have Nietzsche's various references

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:05.680
to the Kant-Laplace hypothesis, you know, that's the hypothesis, the universe came from

02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:10.120
a disordered gaseous state and was formed by physical laws into the various forms that

02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:12.240
exist today.

02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.360
We have references to von Beyer's pulse rate experiments, or thought experiment, I don't

02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:20.760
want to see it, his discussion of Paracelsus and Lavassier.

02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:27.600
These digressions in the lectures are numbered at seven and named by Aniandres and Karl Schlechter

02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:34.800
as quote, seven excursions into the natural sciences end quote.

02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:39.600
Aniandres then wrote the following synopsis of the implications of Nietzsche's interest

02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:46.320
in the natural sciences and the references that Nietzsche brings up and how he uses them.

02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:52.640
He writes, quote, if we now summarize from the seven excursions what characterizes the

02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:57.360
natural sciences for Nietzsche, it would be the following three fundamental matters of

02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:06.680
concern, one, to comprehend nature as one continuous becoming, two, to explain order

02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:16.560
in it, nature, by means of purposeless, simple forces, and three, to conceive qualities

02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:18.680
as quantities.

02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:23.640
In contrast, the question of the essence of matter, as it might be posed for example in

02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:27.480
relation to Democritus's theory, plays no role for Nietzsche.

02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:31.400
He finds himself in complete agreement with natural science.

02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:35.680
It too brackets the question of the essence of matter.

02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:43.840
Nietzsche will later demonstrate this impressively with regard to the Boscovician system end quote.

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:52.480
So in the pre-plutonic figures Nietzsche discovers for himself clarity about the activity of the

02:49:52.480 --> 02:50:00.280
sciences, Thales, Annex Cyminder, and so on, contemplated nature as one continuous becoming,

02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:05.480
insofar as they attempted to find the fundamental nature of matter from which all other forms

02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:08.080
can be derived.

02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:12.760
The attempts to explain nature by means of purposeless and simple forces occur throughout

02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:17.600
the work of Annex Agoras or Democritus.

02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:28.280
And the last trait of conceiving qualities as quantities, we see that in full force in

02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:31.360
the later Pythagoreans.

02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:35.080
They are distinguished by Nietzsche from Pythagoras himself.

02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:41.680
Pythagoras himself is supposed to be more of a mythical cult-like figure.

02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:46.960
The Pythagoreans, on the other hand, gave mathematical explanations of everything, of

02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:51.960
music, of space, of all sorts of qualities and relationships.

02:50:51.960 --> 02:50:56.280
And this is sort of what it means to translate qualities into quantities.

02:50:56.360 --> 02:51:04.000
So it's like, if Democritus is atomism, Democritus plus the later Pythagoreans sort of together

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:12.040
birth this mathematical atomism, which is the way we think about science today, yet again,

02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:13.040
right?

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:18.040
And so the ultimate scientific achievement in Nietzsche's eyes is the creation of a single

02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:25.640
law to describe all patterns and relationships, makes nature into one single continuous becoming,

02:51:25.640 --> 02:51:32.960
and then what is the third thing Annie Ender says, translates this into mathematical form.

02:51:32.960 --> 02:51:37.200
Newton believed that the laws governing physical bodies could not be reduced to less than three

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:38.440
laws.

02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:42.960
Baskovic, meanwhile, has a single law, right?

02:51:42.960 --> 02:51:51.000
And so, and with this one mathematical statement, Baskovic connects gravity, chemistry, electricity,

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.760
cohesion, attraction, and repulsion.

02:51:55.760 --> 02:52:00.080
And so with the Baskovician system, Nietzsche can rebuild the world from the ground up with

02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:03.480
will to power as the basis.

02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:12.480
It's because of this sort of the mathematicizing of the world of the later Pythagoreans, Baskovic

02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:14.400
is called the modern Pythagoras.

02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:20.160
This is in the words of Baskovic's biographer Lancelot Law White.

02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:26.920
He says that Baskovic is, quote, Pythagoras extended to cover process, end quote.

02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:30.800
And so, you know, White's assessment of Pythagoras is sort of at variance with what Nietzsche

02:52:30.800 --> 02:52:32.960
had to say about Pythagoras.

02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:39.480
So we can just take it that by calling Baskovic a Pythagoras extended to cover process.

02:52:39.480 --> 02:52:45.680
He's referring more to Pythagorean philosophy as expressed by the later Pythagoreans.

02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:50.360
Baskovic can be associated with the later Pythagoreans because, you know, these figures

02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:55.840
come after a democratist and similarly, you know, for Nietzsche's purposes, he's charting

02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:01.120
a course of how materialism develops emerging in post-enlightenment Europe just as it did

02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:03.000
in ancient Greece.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:11.040
And so Baskovic is the figure to stand sort of in correspondence to the later Pythagoreans

02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:20.240
and thus completing the materialism that we see in the Greek arena emerging with democratists.

02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:25.160
And with Baskovic, we can finally give the material explanation for things like consciousness,

02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:27.280
mind, values, and so on.

02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:34.000
Or if not Baskovic himself, Nietzsche can take the Baskovician basis and weave that into

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:35.000
his philosophy.

02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:42.840
I'm going to look at one final quote from Whitlock's commentary here because, I mean,

02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:46.720
he does such a good job throughout this, but here he describes the similarity between the

02:53:46.720 --> 02:53:51.400
ancient Pythagorean worldview and Baskovic.

02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:56.520
And he gives us an overall picture of how Baskovician point particle theory sits in

02:53:56.520 --> 02:54:00.920
relation to Newton and Leibniz.

02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:08.360
Chemistry, atomism, Pythagoreanism, overlapped with Nietzsche's intensive and extensive

02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:10.440
interest in Baskovic.

02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:15.200
A far greater importance, however, is the Pythagorean construction of the world from

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.160
points.

02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:23.080
Points in motion constitute lines, intersecting lines create surfaces, surfaces connect to

02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:27.360
make the Pythagorean five regular solids.

02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:32.960
It is precisely in this regard that Baskovic is known as Pythagoras extended to cover process.

02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:39.200
For such solids made of points, though not of five types, in physical processes are what

02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:42.760
Baskovic's theory attempted to describe.

02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:48.400
Baskovic also began with an image of the world as a vast mass of points in motion, interacting

02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:52.240
dynamically and kinematically in pairs.

02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:57.120
He constructed solid objects from these points and even described physical processes by

02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:01.480
reference to a point particle world.

02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:07.120
Unlike the Pythagoreans, Baskovic saw his points as subject to inertia, retraction,

02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:12.440
sorry, attraction, and repulsion as a function of their distance from each other rather than

02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:14.840
of sheer number.

02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:21.000
Baskovic was eclipsed as the greatest European mind of his time only by two contemporaries,

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.360
Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:31.880
The inventors of calculus, Newton and Leibniz embraced corpuscular atomism and monodology,

02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:33.160
respectively.

02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:39.480
Baskovic purposely devised a point particle theory between Newton and Leibniz, but his

02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:46.400
system would suffer highs and lows of respectability, until the advent of Michael Faraday, James

02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:52.480
Clark Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and other late 19th century scientists who acknowledged his

02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:54.480
genius.

02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:59.920
Leibniz's monodology was closely related to Nietzsche's own experimental time atomism,

02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:05.640
but Nietzsche rejected Leibniz's windowless monads for the Baskovician principle of action

02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:07.800
at a distance.

02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:11.720
Baskovic's centers of force were to have inertia and forces dependent on the distance

02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:13.720
between two points.

02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:19.600
Nevertheless, even Baskovic's dynamic properties and non corpuscular atomism, his action at

02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:25.000
a distance in field theory, did not posit an inner driving force.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.360
Baskovician force is external.

02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:32.040
By conceiving of the will to power as the inner dynamic, Nietzsche would go beyond Baskovic

02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:38.120
and Leibniz, though he would only rarely refer to Baskovic by name in his major published

02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:43.120
works.

02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:48.840
After his study of the pre-plotonics, interpreted through the light of the modern philosophers

02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:56.360
of science, in which Nietzsche finds the culmination of this project in Democritus and the later

02:56:56.360 --> 02:57:01.840
Pythagoreans, and then in his own day in Baskovic, the only remaining element Nietzsche needs

02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:07.360
is the will to power, in order to provide qualitative expression of the world.

02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:15.360
And of course, this expression includes the mind itself, Nietzsche, and the willing subject,

02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:23.440
the conscious subject, all of us are the will to power expressing itself.

02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:28.480
Nietzsche can explain philosophy through his new theory because he, like all philosophers,

02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:33.800
is an avatar of the faculty of reason attempting to bound the world, which is yet another form

02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:44.000
of these quantas of power attempting to push against and overcome other things, or overcome

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.960
resistance and challenges.

02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:52.240
Nietzsche thus encounters kindred spirits in his study, which is another thing he gains

02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:56.000
from this, it's not just his philosophy of science, so for example, his favorite is of

02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:01.880
course Heraclitus, but this should not overshadow the other admirable forerunners of Nietzsche's

02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:07.240
task and philosophy, especially figures like Democritus.

02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:13.440
But Nietzsche goes beyond all his influences, he goes beyond Longa by involving Baskovic

02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:19.200
in his system at all, and he even goes beyond Baskovic by sort of drawing on the Schopenhauerian

02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:24.040
idea of an inner content or essence.

02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:29.520
Nietzsche finishes his lecture on the later Pythagoreans with another cryptic remark that,

02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:36.280
quote, if only the Pythagoreans really knew what calculates the world, end quote.

02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:41.520
The implication is perhaps the will to power, but Nietzsche didn't really have that exact

02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:44.560
formulation at this point in his thought.

02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:49.200
Maybe he had the notion of it, but not the words, so we don't really know, maybe we'll

02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:53.200
simply be left to wonder about that.

02:58:53.200 --> 02:58:59.160
Now, okay, let's take a look at some of the more extreme and therefore more interesting

02:58:59.160 --> 02:59:03.680
statements that Nietzsche makes about will to power, where he seems to speak of it not

02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:10.280
merely as a psychological explanation, but as the single force that explains the world.

02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:14.200
We can even see this kind of talk about will to power in at least one place in Nietzsche's

02:59:14.200 --> 02:59:16.600
public or published work.

02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:21.040
It's a passage that's particularly instructive because even though Nietzsche puts material

02:59:21.040 --> 02:59:25.520
in quotation marks in this passage and seems to raise questions about some of the things

02:59:25.520 --> 02:59:31.080
he might have taken for granted during his philological period, his pre-philosophical

02:59:31.080 --> 02:59:37.080
period, this passage makes a lot more sense in light of this physical aspect of the will

02:59:37.080 --> 02:59:42.200
to power, and it makes a lot less sense if you're thinking of will to power in a purely

02:59:42.200 --> 02:59:44.320
psychological sense.

02:59:44.320 --> 02:59:50.880
So we're going to look at Beyond Good and Evil, aphorism 36, which I've slightly abridged.

02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:51.880
Quote,

03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:24.960
mechanistic or material world?

03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:29.880
In the end, not only is it permitted to make this experiment, the conscience of method

03:00:29.880 --> 03:00:32.200
demands it.

03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:37.440
Not to assume several kinds of causality, until the experiment of making do with a single

03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:44.240
one has been pushed to its utmost limit, to the point of nonsense if I may say so.

03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:48.120
That is a moral of method which one may not shirk today.

03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:52.520
It follows from its definition, as a mathematician would say.

03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:57.880
The question is, in the end, whether we really recognize the will as efficient, whether we

03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:00.560
believe in the causality of the will.

03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:05.680
If we do, and at bottom, our faith in this is nothing less than our faith in causality

03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:11.800
itself, then we have to make the experiment of positing the causality of the will hypothetically

03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:13.960
as the only one.

03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:19.400
Will of course can only affect will and not matter, not nerves, for example.

03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:25.040
In short, one has to risk the hypothesis whether will does not affect will wherever

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:31.360
effects are recognized, and whether all mechanical occurrences are not, insofar as a force is

03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:36.960
active in them, will force effects of will.

03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:42.960
Suppose finally we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development

03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:51.160
and ramification of one basic form of the will, namely of the will to power as my proposition

03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:53.000
has it.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:57.300
Suppose all organic functions can be traced back to this will to power, and one could

03:01:57.300 --> 03:02:02.080
also find in it the solution of the problem of procreation and nourishment.

03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:07.360
It is one problem, and then one would have gained the right to determine all efficient

03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:11.760
force univocally as will to power.

03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:17.120
The world viewed from inside, the world defined and determined according to its intelligible

03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:25.640
character, would be will to power and nothing else.

03:02:25.640 --> 03:02:30.680
And so I think the very peculiar thing about Hanitius thought developed after this initial

03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:38.440
immersion in materialism and anti-teleology, it's the idea that he retains from that period

03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:43.800
is the quest to render an expression of the world in as few principles as possible, and

03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:51.920
to do it without appeal to these God and the machine explanations.

03:02:51.920 --> 03:03:01.240
And so here he says, let's take one form of causality that we know is real, or rather

03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:05.880
because in the context of the first book of Beyond Good Nievil, he's been very clear

03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:09.840
in his statements on truth and sort of pointing out we don't actually know that it's real,

03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:13.880
but this is the thing that we have perhaps the most faith in, which is that the will

03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:16.360
is a causal force, right?

03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:21.200
And let's take that one principle and push it through to its ultimate conclusions, even

03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:23.840
to the point of absurdity.

03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:27.640
And so what does that mean where he's saying our belief in the will is synonymous with

03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:29.640
our belief in causality?

03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:36.800
I mean, he's saying that in our own experience, we experience volition as a causal force.

03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:43.160
Whether it's free or not free, this is true for Nietzsche, either way, it's his way of

03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:48.200
talking about what people might call the experience of making choices, whether the choice is freely

03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:50.680
made or not.

03:03:50.680 --> 03:03:55.720
For Nietzsche, it's the will itself rather than rational, deliberative intellect that

03:03:55.720 --> 03:03:57.880
causes our actions.

03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:02.480
And so if it's permitted to talk of causes at all, then the cause is will.

03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:04.480
This is the only immediate reality that we know.

03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.080
Why not begin from this position that will is the only given?

03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:10.640
Because the only given is our experience.

03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:18.320
So it would mean therefore that will cannot affect quote unquote matter, but only other

03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:21.400
expressions or centers of will.

03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:24.920
Since we've already said that will is the only reality.

03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:28.760
Why not begin from the position of viewing the world from inside, from its intelligible

03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:34.660
character, the only thing that is given or intelligible to us?

03:04:34.660 --> 03:04:41.280
And so the fundamental character of matter, that matter would simply be the mind symbol

03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:46.600
for representing it, but the fundamental character of matter as a sort of experiment, as the

03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:53.760
way Nietzsche phrases it, conceive of matter as basically being will, will being the essence

03:04:53.760 --> 03:04:55.120
of matter.

03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:59.760
So that might be one sense I kind of disagree with Whitlock, or maybe he's correct about

03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:03.560
Nietzsche during the period of the, when he's lecturing as a philologist.

03:05:03.560 --> 03:05:08.800
But I think later he does sort of come down in the ideas that once he starts thinking

03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:12.800
about will to power as an inner force or an inner intelligible character, he is not bracketing

03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:17.960
the question of matter, essence of matter any longer, he is asking what it is.

03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:21.400
But it's still just an experiment, right?

03:05:21.400 --> 03:05:27.360
But Nietzsche says that his proposition of describing the most fundamental and single

03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:32.480
unifying principle as will to power is the only single philosophical principle one can

03:05:32.480 --> 03:05:37.600
use, which describes all efficient force in the world, which is very interesting.

03:05:37.600 --> 03:05:42.200
Like that, you know, it's more explanatory than Schopenhauer's will to live or Spinoza's

03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:43.200
canatus.

03:05:43.200 --> 03:05:46.040
That's what he's saying here.

03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:51.800
And so that if you're just thinking about will to power as a moral or psychological

03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:58.000
principle, the full force of that power doesn't really come through, or of that passage doesn't

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:03.240
really come through that he's saying will to power is the true character of the world

03:06:03.240 --> 03:06:09.600
first and foremost, and that that's the most explanatory lens we have at the moment in

03:06:09.600 --> 03:06:14.320
order to talk about it.

03:06:14.320 --> 03:06:16.640
This issue, I think, is clarified in his notes.

03:06:16.640 --> 03:06:25.000
This is in will to power number 619, quote, the victorious concept force by means of

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:30.600
which our physicists have created God in the world still needs to be completed, an inner

03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:36.080
will must be ascribed to it, which I designate as will to power, i.e. an insatiable desire

03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:41.880
to manifest power, whereas the employment and exercise of power as a creative drive,

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:48.920
etc. Physicists cannot eradicate action at a distance from their principles, nor can

03:06:48.920 --> 03:06:53.200
they eradicate a repellent force or an attracting one.

03:06:53.200 --> 03:06:54.760
There is nothing for it.

03:06:54.760 --> 03:07:00.600
One is obliged to understand all motion, all appearances, all laws, only a symptoms of

03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:05.720
an inner event, and to employ man as an analogy to this end.

03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:10.760
In the case of an animal, it is possible to trace all its drives to the will to power.

03:07:10.840 --> 03:07:19.000
Likewise, all the functions of organic life to this one source, end quote.

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:23.760
So while those rigorous scientific minds of today who may be listening may have borne

03:07:23.760 --> 03:07:27.480
with me for quite a while in this discussion, we're getting to the point that Nietzsche's

03:07:27.480 --> 03:07:35.000
views maybe are having less value towards answering questions and philosophy of science.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:40.120
But maybe the best takeaway is that we're gaining an insight into the way Nietzsche

03:07:40.200 --> 03:07:47.560
thinks and that he has a valid criticism in the fact that we're content to say that things are,

03:07:47.560 --> 03:07:48.360
what is it?

03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:53.560
Well, it's a force without giving some definitive content by which we can describe what it means

03:07:53.560 --> 03:07:55.160
to invoke a force.

03:07:55.160 --> 03:08:00.200
And his idea of what it means to invoke a force is that this concept is yet another

03:08:00.840 --> 03:08:02.520
manifestation of will to power.

03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:07.880
And we can see his defense of Boskovich on this passage, even though Boskovich goes unnamed,

03:08:08.120 --> 03:08:12.040
he defends action at a distance, which is central to Boskovich's theory.

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:19.400
And that his single mathematical expression explains the behavior of nature as it manifests

03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:22.200
differently depending on the scale of distance involved.

03:08:22.200 --> 03:08:28.520
And Nietzsche references a repellent and attractive forces keyed to the description

03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:31.240
of Boskovich's force point particles.

03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:37.000
He references it in relation to will to power, which means that he is thinking about will to power

03:08:37.080 --> 03:08:38.680
in a physical sense, right?

03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:39.480
Sense of physics.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:45.080
Now, some of his later notes as we go further into his career,

03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:51.080
as we've talked about, he ends up taking a somewhat dim view of mechanism

03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:59.240
and thought that materialism taken too far itself sort of becomes a bit metaphysical.

03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:01.560
And I think that's because of the problem of causality,

03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:07.160
which I think Nietzsche genuinely doesn't believe that we can derive causality from anything,

03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:07.480
right?

03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:12.440
That we're left regarding causality as either a sort of like artifact of our representation

03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:15.560
of the world, which means it's not independent of the human mind,

03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:20.920
or else we have to call it a sort of metaphysical force like Canatus, right?

03:09:20.920 --> 03:09:25.240
So mechanistic explanations don't ultimately do it for Nietzsche.

03:09:25.240 --> 03:09:30.360
And because of his insistence that the most real thing is the intelligible character,

03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:33.960
that's the only thing that's actually a given, that matters should basically,

03:09:34.840 --> 03:09:37.480
we should start from the position that matter is will to power.

03:09:40.200 --> 03:09:49.080
Then it's less important for him to present a mechanistic world in the sense that everything

03:09:49.080 --> 03:09:54.360
is governed by cause and effect, as it is to present the idea that the various phenomenal

03:09:54.360 --> 03:10:03.880
forms are simply can all be bounded within the explanation of Baskovician unified field theory,

03:10:03.880 --> 03:10:04.120
right?

03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:11.400
In the note numbered 624, Nietzsche argues against the physical atom.

03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:17.240
And so here he takes the inverse position that transforming qualities into quantities is in

03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:22.440
any way a useful thing when Nietzsche writes, quote, the calculability of the world,

03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:26.760
the expressibility of all events and formulas, is this really comprehension?

03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:32.680
How much of a piece of music has been understood when that in it which is calculable and can be

03:10:32.680 --> 03:10:35.640
reduced to formulas has been reckoned up, end quote.

03:10:37.400 --> 03:10:42.360
And he even acknowledges in the note number 627 that attraction and repulsion,

03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:46.440
which are central aspects of Baskovician physics, are fictions.

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:51.960
And he says that this attempt to think about the world in a purely mechanistic sense is a desire

03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:53.320
to see causality everywhere.

03:10:53.320 --> 03:10:59.960
And he goes so far as to say in that note that quote, the belief in cause falls with the belief

03:10:59.960 --> 03:11:06.280
in tele, parentheses, against Spinoza and his causalism, end quote.

03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:11.640
And so with everything we've talked about, that should be rather clear, right?

03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:16.040
It's a he's actually giving a rather radical view that seriously depends on the fact that

03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:21.000
departs from his earlier views as we've covered them in this talk, that to say that any belief

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:26.440
in cause and effect constitutes a teleology, which Nietzsche will therefore oppose.

03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:34.680
And so Nietzsche's complex views on causality, I mean, I've said it, I think elsewhere,

03:11:34.680 --> 03:11:39.080
or I think I might have brought it up in a Q&A, which is not going to be out yet to the public,

03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:42.120
but I might have to do an episode just strictly on causality.

03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:44.360
It's probably not going to be for a little while.

03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:46.440
But it really complicates the issue.

03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:50.680
It complicates the understanding of later Nietzsche's views of science rather considerably.

03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:58.360
But we also find in the notes collected in Will to Power, a clear continuation of Nietzsche's quest

03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:03.960
to reshape the world into something which is fundamentally only Will to Power.

03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:08.200
And to understand Will to Power is something all pervasive, something constitutive of,

03:12:08.200 --> 03:12:14.360
constitutive, I have so much trouble with that word, of all phenomena.

03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:20.840
And so Will to Power is something which is descriptive of all becoming,

03:12:21.880 --> 03:12:26.120
an attempt to bound the boundless just as the prepletonics like Democritus were doing.

03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:31.000
And I think in his unpublished notes that we have in the Will to Power collection,

03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:34.440
Nietzsche is in his more ambitious moments.

03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:39.640
He thinks he has this element of Will to Power which would allow him to take Democritus,

03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:46.680
take Boskovich, and move on to this fundamental unifying theory that accounts for purposefulness

03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:49.400
and movement and procreation and nourishment.

03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:53.960
I'm going to be perfectly honest with all of you when I say that at the end of this,

03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:57.000
I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around everything Nietzsche is getting at

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:58.280
in his philosophy of science.

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:03.080
And insofar as Will to Power can be understood as a natural or physical principle.

03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:07.560
And this is part of the reason why I think Nietzsche did not publish some of his more

03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:09.560
radical statements about Will to Power.

03:13:09.560 --> 03:13:12.840
It's why he only mentions Boskovich very rarely in his published work.

03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:17.480
I think there's a concern that his statements might be misunderstood or misrepresented,

03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:21.000
or taken in a teleological or religious sense.

03:13:22.360 --> 03:13:27.240
Perhaps Nietzsche's skepticism of causality or his awareness of the contingency of all human

03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:32.760
perspective or similar such concerns led him to regard such a grand unifying

03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:36.600
philosophical theory as being impure thinking.

03:13:37.720 --> 03:13:44.040
This might be why Nietzsche abandoned the idea of Will to Power as a planned magnum opus.

03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:48.760
Maybe he considered it was just better not to go there and let these ideas remain in the

03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:50.680
background of his published works.

03:13:50.680 --> 03:13:53.640
Something which informs his ideas and informs the way he thinks,

03:13:53.640 --> 03:13:57.000
but it's best not to bring it into the foreground because of the misunderstandings

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:57.800
that there could be.

03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:04.600
On the other hand, with this more scientifically rich understanding of what the Will to Power

03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:11.480
can be, I think we should now consider one of the most infamous passages of Nietzsche's work.

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:16.760
And it's actually the very last passage contained in the collection of unpublished notes

03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:18.360
in Will to Power.

03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:23.400
It's rightfully infamous because if you haven't engaged with the full breadth of Nietzsche's

03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:29.640
ideas, such a passage can be really dangerous, I think, but it's one of the finest examples

03:14:29.640 --> 03:14:32.360
of gorgeous overflowing Nietzschean prose.

03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:38.920
And I think it attains a powerful subtlety of meaning in light of these considerations

03:14:39.560 --> 03:14:41.960
of Nietzsche's scientific influences.

03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:48.600
And so the last note in Will to Power aphorism 1067, quote,

03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:53.480
And do you know what the world is to me?

03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:56.360
Shall I show it to you in my mirror?

03:14:57.640 --> 03:15:02.680
This world, a monster of energy without beginning, without end.

03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:07.640
A firm iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller,

03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:14.920
that does not expend itself but only transforms itself as a whole of unalterable size,

03:15:15.800 --> 03:15:21.160
a household without expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income,

03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:28.520
enclosed by nothingness as by a boundary, not something blurry or wasted,

03:15:28.520 --> 03:15:34.440
not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force,

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:40.680
and not a space that might be empty here or there, but rather as a force throughout,

03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:46.120
as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many,

03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:52.360
increasing here and at the same time decreasing there, a sea of forces flowing and rushing

03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:58.600
together, eternally changing, eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence,

03:15:58.600 --> 03:16:04.520
with an ebb and a flood of its forms, out of the simplest forms striving towards the most

03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:10.680
complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms striving towards the hottest,

03:16:11.240 --> 03:16:16.840
most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple,

03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:21.720
out of this abundance, out of the play of contradictions, back to the joy of concord,

03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:26.920
still affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years,

03:16:26.920 --> 03:16:30.440
blessing itself as that which must return eternally,

03:16:30.680 --> 03:16:36.680
as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness,

03:16:37.640 --> 03:16:44.360
this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating, the eternally self-destroying,

03:16:44.360 --> 03:16:51.560
this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my beyond good and evil, without goal,

03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:58.760
unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal, without will, unless a ring feels good will

03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:04.840
towards itself," end quote. And so what do we find in this description of the world?

03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:12.520
It is a totality of unalterable size, not something blurry and undefined,

03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:17.720
and not endlessly extended. To Nietzsche the world is something definite,

03:17:17.720 --> 03:17:24.520
with definite boundaries and definite size. So it's not the indefinite of Anaximander, right?

03:17:25.320 --> 03:17:29.880
And it's ruled by transformations, dynamism of forms arising and passing away.

03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:35.240
Even though the total size, the totality of matter itself does not alter. So the fundamental,

03:17:36.680 --> 03:17:42.120
you know, we could say the fundamental material of the world changes in shape and arrangement,

03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:47.160
but nothing is created or destroyed. It's a household without expenses or losses,

03:17:47.240 --> 03:17:54.760
without increase or income. So the similarities there to Democritus and to Anaxagoras,

03:17:54.760 --> 03:17:59.720
and even to Heraclitus are very clear. And what else does Nietzsche say about this world of his?

03:18:00.440 --> 03:18:06.440
Quote, a play of forces and waves of forces at the same time one in many, increasing here and at

03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:12.200
the same time decreasing there, a sea of forces flowing and rushing together eternally changing,

03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:18.360
end quote. This is the multiplicity of phenomena within the world of becoming.

03:18:18.360 --> 03:18:21.000
And these separate phenomena are really centers of force,

03:18:22.040 --> 03:18:26.200
force points, if you will, flowing and rushing and pushing against one another.

03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:33.240
This one force pervades everywhere. So Boskovich, right? And everywhere, what do we find? Recurrence.

03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:37.720
The simple strives towards the complex, the hot towards the cold.

03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:43.720
So we even see preplotonic forces that were incorporated into the Nietzschean world,

03:18:43.720 --> 03:18:46.120
right? Warmth and cold and attraction and repulsion,

03:18:47.480 --> 03:18:53.400
you know, the voice of Anaximida and Empedocles. And we might consider also how Nietzsche understands

03:18:53.400 --> 03:19:00.200
will to power as manifesting in life forms, which start as young and vigorous and grow into maturity,

03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:05.080
and then their energy leaves them and they decline eventually. And so he sees strength

03:19:05.720 --> 03:19:12.040
as expanding until it eventually declines, something which bursts forth and then passes away.

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:18.760
He sees weakness or dissolution as ever recursive, always arising again to break down the various

03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:25.560
manifestations of will. And taking influence from Heraclitus, he sees this world as essentially

03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:32.600
innocent. It's beyond good and evil. It knows no disgust, no satiety. So he would reject the

03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:38.680
Empedoclean view of a metaphysical reality to love or hatred or the Schopenhauerian view of life,

03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:43.720
reducing to satiety and boredom, you know, this eternal suffering of desire and want.

03:19:44.520 --> 03:19:48.680
To Nietzsche, this world is eternally creating and eternally destroying,

03:19:48.680 --> 03:19:55.160
but it's ever innocent and self affirming. It's the innocence of becoming, the play of Aeon,

03:19:55.160 --> 03:19:59.400
the boy god of the zodiac, building sand castles on the beach and knocking them down.

03:20:00.360 --> 03:20:06.360
The world, just like the play of a child, has no goal, unless the circle itself is the goal,

03:20:06.360 --> 03:20:12.600
right? So in other words, no telos. We can only observe the pattern which the world produces

03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:19.560
blindly, which is endless recursion, the eternal spin of these forces manifesting creation,

03:20:20.360 --> 03:20:26.280
and then bringing on destruction in an endless repeating dance. So Nietzsche then tells us,

03:20:27.240 --> 03:20:34.200
in no uncertain terms, his central principle is the unity, the sole law or formulation from which

03:20:34.200 --> 03:20:39.560
he gets his picture of what the world is. And the ending of this passage is so good that,

03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:45.640
now I've done most of the commentary already, you know, and I've talked for a long time. So

03:20:45.640 --> 03:20:50.520
we're just going to end here with Nietzsche's words. Nietzsche concludes, quote,

03:20:51.480 --> 03:20:56.360
Do you want a name for this world, a solution for all of its riddles,

03:20:57.400 --> 03:21:03.480
a light for you too, you best concealed strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men.

03:21:05.080 --> 03:21:12.280
This world is the will to power and nothing besides. And you yourselves are also this will

03:21:12.280 --> 03:21:21.160
to power and nothing besides end quote. That's all everyone signing off.

03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:43.660
you
