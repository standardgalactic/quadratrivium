1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Quote, whether primitive or not, mankind always stands in the brink of actions it performs

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
itself but does not control.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,040
The whole world wants peace, and the whole world prepares for war, to take but one example.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,100
Mankind is powerless against mankind, and the gods as ever show it in the ways of fate.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,400
Today we call the gods factors, which comes from facere to make.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,040
The makers stand behind the wings of the world theater.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,480
It is so in great things as in small.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,320
In the realm of consciousness we are our own masters, we seem to be the factors themselves,

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,920
but if we step through the door of the shadow, we discover with terror that we are the objects

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
of unseen factors.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,000
To know this is decidedly unpleasant, for nothing is more disillusioning than the discovery

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,720
of our own inadequacy.

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,480
Mankind can even give rise to primitive panic, because instead of being believed in, the

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,320
anxiously guarded supremacy of consciousness, which is, in truth, one of the secrets of

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,080
human success, is questioned in the most dangerous way.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
End quote.

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,920
That's from Carl Jung's essay, Arc Types of the Collective Unconscious, and in that

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,600
passage Jung puts forward the central idea of his philosophy of the psyche, his most

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,520
important and also his most terrifying.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,360
Here he raises the prospect of mankind as a creature who is not the maker of his own

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,840
fate, a creature who is in the hands of the gods.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,200
In modern times we've renamed these divinities, we've made them accord with a mechanistic

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,720
scientific understanding of the world, and we've presumed that on this basis we can dispense

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,360
with these gods, we can regard the ego-consciousness as its own self-governing autonomous entity.

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,840
Carl Jung's project is, in some sense, as simple as the project of restoring our awareness

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,380
of these unseen factors, driving our thought and action, and restoring a sense of respect

27
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,280
and awe for them, the project to restore a healthy respect for the gods, which we now

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,280
call unconscious factors.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,240
And in doing this Jung seeks to revive the religious or mythic language by which we

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,120
used to speak about these things, which he believes still dwell deep within the human

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,320
psyche, not as part of our consciousness, not as subjects within the power of the consciousness,

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,680
but as the master behind the throne of consciousness.

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,200
As straightforward as this may seem, however, such a prospect remains a daunting challenge

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,160
for the modern man, because we have not found gods and goddesses in our search of the stars

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,320
and of galaxies.

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,240
We have not found that the atoms are moved by mystical forces.

37
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,360
We've come to regard past mythologies as so many childish fables, which may serve as

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,280
a source of historical fascination, but which elucidates nothing about the objective world,

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,160
or the human condition as such.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,880
The various mystical pursuits of man, whether it was the practice of astrology in which we

41
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,800
attempted to discover our future through the interpretation of the movement of celestial

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,400
bodies, or the great work of the alchemists, those proto-scientists who believed that the

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,920
laws which govern the divine are the same as the laws that govern the material world,

44
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,600
or the many religious stories and prophecies recorded in our holy books that endeavor to

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,520
tell us the origin and meaning of life through divine revelation.

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,560
The modern mind looks at all of this and sees nothing but a series of outdated and

47
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,080
unscientific assertions.

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,560
These were merely culturally and geographically bound folktales in the modern view.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,280
They reveal nothing about the real meaning of human life, that is, if we even permit

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,200
that life may have a meaning, which in itself is regarded as a disagreeable presumption.

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,960
We might say that we see all of these artifacts of religious thought as childish things coming

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:18,120
from the youth and ignorance of youth of our race, and to put it in the language of the

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,280
Bible, the scientific modern mind says it is high past time to put away childish things.

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,280
And yet, throughout Jung's work in psychoanalysis, he steadily began to believe that these mythical

55
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,540
figures and stories are far more than the mere playthings of a more childish mankind

56
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,760
that could simply be put to the side upon the scientific maturity of the human race.

57
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,880
The reason for Jung's suspicion is based on the observation that his patients would recreate

58
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,480
the imagery of myth and religion, in their dreams, or in the case of schizophrenics,

59
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,960
in their hallucinations.

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,120
Furthermore, when Jung had his patients draw or paint freely as a form of therapeutic exercise,

61
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
he found they would do peculiar things.

62
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,600
They would draw mandalas, for example, a type of circular sigil common to the imagery of

63
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Eastern spirituality, but completely unknown Jung tells us among his European patients

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,840
at that time.

65
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,120
They would draw upon the same kinds of allegories used by esoteric Christians such as the Russa

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Crucian Order, but without having any knowledge that they were doing so.

67
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,360
And Jung began to suspect that there was a language, a lexicon, being employed here,

68
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,440
a language of images and symbols that seemed to derive from a deeper well than the mere

69
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,080
personal experience of his patients or their cultural upbringing, that his patients were

70
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,880
drawing upon something deep within the psyche that was not individual, but universal.

71
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,920
The collective psychic contents of all mankind, which we use when we attempt to discuss the

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,040
most significant aspects and events of our lives, the most transformative experiences

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,000
of life, draws upon this language.

74
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Given the material that we've already covered this season, one can see the mark of Nietzsche's

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,080
thought on Jung's already from this description, as well as the ways in which Jung develops

76
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,120
the thought of his erstwhile friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,400
Unlike Freud, Jung was never interested in hiding his influences or claiming originality

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
for himself or his ideas.

79
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,680
I mean, in some sense Jung's whole project is oriented around the idea that he is not

80
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,920
an original thinker, that he's simply returning us to the knowledge that we have already held

81
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
since time immemorial.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,240
But we've forgotten this with the death of our mythic language, our mythic understanding

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,680
or perspective that allowed us to talk about it.

84
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,240
Jung also credits previous thinkers such as Carus and von Hartmann as those who had brought

85
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
to light the power of the unconscious.

86
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,880
But where Jung goes beyond all these previous figures is insofar as he presents us with

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:12,760
a comprehensible system for approaching and understanding this vast and confusing realm

88
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,200
of the unconscious contents.

89
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,800
It is through psychology that we can once again approach the mythic and reintegrate these

90
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:29,080
two seemingly incongruous elements of our rational, moral, and outward persona with

91
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:37,600
the mysterious, powerful, numinous archetypes which are the secret makers of our destiny.

92
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,840
Karl Gustav Jung was born in 1875 in Switzerland.

93
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,360
Broadly speaking, his life bears some similarities to Nietzsche's.

94
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,080
As a young man, he initially thought of attending seminary and becoming a minister.

95
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,000
And then as a teenager, he began to study philosophy and this changed his plans for

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
life.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,920
He opted to pursue the sciences instead.

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,640
While in Nietzsche's case, the path leads the young Friedrich Nietzsche to the discipline

99
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,880
of philology, Karl Jung pursued psychiatry.

100
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,840
He attended the University of Basel where he studied medicine.

101
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,400
By the early 1900s, he was in correspondence with Sigmund Freud.

102
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,360
The two men leave us a considerable volume of letters.

103
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,640
Freud was much older than Jung and over the period of six years during which they collaborated

104
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:33,280
extensively, Freud famously wanted Jung to become his successor in some sense.

105
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,160
He was trying to push Jung in that direction.

106
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,600
He wanted him to become the lifetime president of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,080
And Freud was overruled in this.

108
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
Jung instead served as president for two years instead of a lifetime appointment.

109
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,480
But he referred to Jung as his adoptive son, his sort of crown prince and successor.

110
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,880
As is commonly known, however, there was always a rift between the two men that would only

111
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,080
grow as the years went by.

112
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,600
Jung was dissatisfied with Freud's focus on sexuality as the primary driver of human

113
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
psychology.

114
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:18,160
Furthermore, he respected Freud's work as regards repression and his work on the id as

115
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,280
a repository for all that which the consciousness has attempted to suppress.

116
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,960
But Jung began to suspect that there was something far faster than a mere personal unconsciousness

117
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,040
beneath the surface world of the ego.

118
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,000
With the publication of Jung's lectures on the psychology of the unconscious in 1913,

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,600
a book which you can now find under the title of symbols of transformation, the disagreement

120
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,480
between the two men would only increase in its intensity.

121
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,560
And as a matter of fact, Jung said that this book's publication was the thing that ended

122
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,000
their friendship.

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,720
As Jung in that text made it clear just how seriously he differed with Freud's account

124
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
of the psyche.

125
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,960
Freud, it seems, had only wanted a crown prince and successor so long as they agreed

126
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,240
with him and carried on Freud's own project on Freud's own terms.

127
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,160
Furthermore, Freud is an atheist, and he's enrolled in a completely different kind of

128
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,920
task in the field of psychology than Jung is, whereas Freud's psychoanalysis sought to

129
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,520
explain the human being within a godless world, a world in which man's higher aspirations

130
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,040
could be seen as outgrowths of base urges.

131
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,280
All of man's moral sentiments could be born on the power of the libido.

132
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,560
Jung's tendency is almost the exact opposite.

133
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,240
In the depths of the unconsciousness, Jung does not see mere animal impulses or something

134
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,860
reducible to the basis drives of man.

135
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,040
He sees a well where we can reach down deep in it into truths so profound and inexpressible

136
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,800
by the consciousness that they can only be understood in religious terms.

137
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,520
Whereas Freud found in psychology the refutation of religious thinking as a curative to the

138
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,760
pathological complexes of the modern man, Jung found the affirmation of the value of

139
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,400
such thinking to be the very cure that the modern man was seeking.

140
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,360
The break with Freud had professional consequences for Jung, while Freud has been left behind

141
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,720
in the psychology of our time.

142
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,920
In the early decades of the 20th century Freud was the preeminent figure of the psychoanalysts.

143
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,560
He was essentially its founder and its greatest celebrity.

144
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,280
Jung more or less has a midlife crisis at this point.

145
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,960
He had what can only be described as an extended psychological episode that we could characterize

146
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,240
as either hysteria or depression or perhaps both.

147
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,960
At many times he was borderline suicidal, and during this time in which Jung spent

148
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,680
extended periods in solitude, he authored his Red Book, a series of diaries with fantastical

149
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,600
religious imagery which Jung saw as his way of working through what he perceived as a

150
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,080
dark night of the soul, which is a perennial theme in one's path of mystical or spiritual

151
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,520
transformation.

152
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,240
Jung however made it through this trying period, and he began publishing his work again in

153
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,400
various academic journals.

154
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,480
He served as an army doctor during World War I. In the interwar years he embarked on some

155
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,520
of his most famous and influential projects, including his book Psychological Types.

156
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,080
And during World War II a fun tidbit about his life that was not known until recently,

157
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,840
because if I recall correctly it was classified, but Jung wrote reports that he sent to the

158
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,160
U.S.S. the American Intelligence Branch that would later become the CIA, advising the Americans

159
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,720
on Hitler's mental state.

160
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,360
He traveled the world visiting America, Britain, Africa, India, equating himself with the mythic

161
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,440
underpinnings of the various world religions.

162
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,680
He was productive until his final year, until he passed away at the age of 85 in the year

163
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,680
1961.

164
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,120
The origins of Jung's theory of archetype states all the way back to his first major

165
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,120
publication on the psychology and pathology of so-called occult phenomena published in

166
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,920
1902.

167
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,200
This was the work that had drawn Freud's attention at the time.

168
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,760
In this work Jung described the hallucinatory fantasies of a hysterical spiritual medium

169
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,200
whose seances Jung attended in the late 1890s.

170
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,640
Should be noted, there was something of a craze surrounding seances and mediums during

171
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,240
the late 1800s and the first decades of the 1900s.

172
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,560
So this wasn't a terribly unusual social outing.

173
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,480
Jung notes how the patient, the spirit medium, would have these somnambulic attacks.

174
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,840
She would lose control of her motor function, be confronted by visions of spirits.

175
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,720
However, the patient's ego, her sense of her individual conscious persona, was present

176
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,600
and intact during these incidents.

177
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,040
That is, she did not display multiple personalities herself.

178
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,080
She seemed to remain the conscious subject, merely encountering these avatars of her unconscious

179
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
mind.

180
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,120
You see the first intimation of archetypes in this work, and that Jung comes to understand

181
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,240
that even though the spirits that the patient encounters are numerous, they could be grouped,

182
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,360
so to speak, into two definite types.

183
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,440
That in some sense all the different iterations of these spirit personalities were in fact

184
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:47,680
reiterations of the same two unconscious sub-personalities or complexes.

185
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,200
Jung writes in this article, quote,

186
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,800
It seems that many secondary series of ideas must have split off quite early from the primary

187
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,960
unconscious personality.

188
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,880
For already after the first two seances, spirits appeared by the dozen.

189
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,560
The names were inexhaustible in variety, but the differences between the personalities

190
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,960
were soon exhausted and it became apparent that they could all be subsumed under two

191
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,240
types, the serial religious type and the gay hilarious.

192
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,240
So far it was really only a matter of two different unconscious personalities, which

193
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,120
appeared under different names, but had no essential differences, end quote.

194
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,640
This insight is the germ of much of Jung's later thought.

195
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,880
It's a theme he would see play out time and again with multiple patients.

196
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,000
The same cast of characters, more or less, innumerable in terms of the exact name or

197
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,600
the image attributed to the character by the patient, but nevertheless the same in essence

198
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,040
as other iterations of the same character type.

199
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,560
Jung's research in the various world religions was spurred on by this same underlying idea.

200
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:03,600
He began to perceive that types appear in the myth-making of the various world cultures.

201
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Jung writes, quote,

202
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:10,200
Permit of man impresses us so strongly with his subjectivity that we should really have

203
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,800
guessed long ago that myths refer to something psychic, end quote.

204
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,160
But unlike Freud, Jung did not seek to make our myths small and insignificant on that

205
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
basis.

206
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,520
Instead, he grows to see the depths of human psychology as being just as profound as our

207
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,120
oldest stories, and in fact it's the well from which these stories are drawn.

208
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,480
Now, as our main focus for this episode, we're going to turn to Volume 9 of Jung's

209
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,040
collected works, which includes his essays written from the time of 1933 onward on the

210
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,000
subject of the archetypes and the collective unconscious.

211
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,720
From the very beginning of that volume, in the first essay included there entitled archetypes

212
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,560
of the collective unconscious, Jung makes clear the operative difference between his

213
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,320
own thought and that of Freud, quote.

214
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,400
At first, the concept of the unconscious was limited to denoting the state of repressed

215
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,440
or forgotten contents.

216
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,120
Even with Freud, who makes the unconscious, at least metaphorically, take the stage as

217
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,960
acting subject, it is really nothing but the gathering place of forgotten and repressed

218
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,720
contents, and has a functional significance thanks only to these.

219
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,480
For Freud, accordingly, the unconscious is of an exclusively personal nature, although

220
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,520
he was aware of its archaic and mythological thought forms.

221
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,320
A more or less superficial layer of the unconscious is undoubtedly personal.

222
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,760
I call it the personal unconscious.

223
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,160
But this personal unconscious rests upon a deeper layer, which does not derive from personal

224
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,600
experience and is not a personal acquisition, but is inborn.

225
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,760
This deeper layer I call the collective unconscious.

226
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,520
I have chosen the name collective because this part of the unconscious is not individual

227
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,080
but universal.

228
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,000
In contrast to the personal psyche, it has contents and modes of behavior that are more

229
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,240
or less the same everywhere and in all individuals.

230
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,560
It is, in other words, identical in all men and thus constitutes the common psychic substrate

231
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,760
of a super personal nature which is present in every one of us, end quote.

232
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,240
The collective unconscious is often wrongly characterized as a sort of supernatural claim

233
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,720
about humanity, as if we have some sort of psychic link between our minds or sort of

234
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,160
hive mind unconsciousness, something of the like.

235
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:43,000
The actual claim is simply that, in the same way that we're all born with certain instincts,

236
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,520
we're also all born with certain unconscious knowledge, that we have a pre-rational lexicon

237
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,560
of imagery or symbolism that exists in all human minds.

238
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:59,400
It's a starting, basic kit of information that's contained in the unconscious prior

239
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,680
to any enculturation or upbringing.

240
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,280
It's really no stronger of a claim than any claim about inborn traits or knowledge that

241
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,680
exists in every human being, which I think would be fairly hard to argue against.

242
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,400
To say that there is no universal, relatable palette of human emotions or impulses would

243
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,600
simply be patently false.

244
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,560
All human beings experience anger, experience sexual urges, experience hunger and thirst,

245
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,520
all human beings have a fight or flight mechanism, we can easily accept such ideas.

246
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,760
The troubling assertion that Jung makes, really, is that human nature also contains unconscious

247
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,120
information, not just unconscious instinct.

248
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,400
This is not to be considered knowledge or information of a kind that would necessarily

249
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,760
be parsed by a rational discursive intellect, wherever it makes itself known, it appears

250
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:58,640
not in the form of word concepts or abstract ideas, but in the form of these figures, images

251
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,080
or narratives.

252
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,080
We can see how Jung's work draws upon Freud, or serves as an elaboration upon it, and that

253
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,760
Jung also believes that the repressed personal unconsciousness is what lies beneath the surface

254
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,800
of the ego.

255
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,280
But Jung thinks that this repressed, unacceptable psychic content is itself only another surface

256
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,680
layer sitting upon this wide world of the id.

257
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,640
Jung describes in this essay a number of profound religious dreams, in which this vaster unconsciousness

258
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,960
is likened to a sea or a dark lake.

259
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,000
The association of the unconsciousness with water is a common symbol found in such dreams

260
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,640
and experiences.

261
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,760
Jung describes one dreamer who often saw the castle of the Grail sitting on a high mountaintop,

262
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,960
but found that he could only reach it by passing, quote, a darksome gorge with underworldly

263
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,680
water rushing along the bottom, end quote.

264
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,280
Another patient, a Protestant theologian, had a recurring dream in which he was standing

265
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,200
on a high mountain slope, looking down into the deep valley below, in which there was

266
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,040
a dark lake.

267
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,800
In the dream, he felt that something always held him back from going down to the lake,

268
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,480
but he decided to venture there anyway.

269
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,440
As he approached the water, quote, everything grew dark and uncanny, and a gust of wind suddenly

270
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,000
rushed over the face of the water.

271
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,200
He was seized by a panic fear and awoke, end quote.

272
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,960
Water is only one of the common symbols for a confrontation with the unconsciousness,

273
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,280
and a theme we can already see developing in these two example dreams is that in order

274
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,920
to reach a place perceived as above the psyche, the ideal, the spiritual, however we may interpret

275
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,680
it, one must first journey downward.

276
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,360
The imagery of water, of a lake or sea seems natural for the human mind, it indicates something

277
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,800
of which we can only see the surface, but beneath which there is an unfathomable depth.

278
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,280
To approach the unconsciousness is always a somewhat fearful experience because the first

279
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,080
layer of it contains those very repressed contents, of the contents that were repressed

280
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,880
by the consciousness that characterized the Freudian version of the id, far from being

281
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,600
strictly sexual, this unconscious layer represents everything about our public outward facing

282
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,600
persona that we cannot show the world or manifest in our conscious life and thought.

283
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,480
It is just as much our self as our waking self, but it's the dark reflection of that

284
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
waking self.

285
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,160
Jung writes, quote, whoever looks into the mirror of the water will see first of all

286
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:58,880
his own face, whoever goes to himself risks a confrontation with himself, the mirror does

287
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,440
not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it, namely the face we never show

288
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,920
to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of an actor, but the mirror

289
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,760
lies behind the mask and shows the true face, end quote.

290
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,080
This is what Jung calls the shadow, it is the sum total of everything about ourselves

291
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,640
which we have judged as negative, but it would be a mistake to think that the shadow does

292
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,880
not operate in the world through our conscious personality, it does not remain confined to

293
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,720
our unconscious thoughts or dreams.

294
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,200
On the contrary, Jung says that quote, the shadow is a living part of the personality

295
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,160
and therefore wants to live with it in some form, it cannot be argued out of existence

296
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,040
or rationalized into harmlessness, end quote.

297
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,800
The way that Jung describes the shadow as a phenomenon, a psychic phenomenon is exceedingly

298
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,360
fascinating because the shadow is both a terrible figure, but it is also the herald of a great

299
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,840
personal transformation.

300
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,000
Just as one must find their way across the terrible rushing waters of a dark gorge in

301
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,760
order to find their way to the holy grail, the shadow is the gateway to a deeper understanding

302
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,680
of oneself.

303
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,240
Jung writes in paragraph 45 of that same essay quote, the meeting with oneself is, at first,

304
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
the meeting with one's own shadow.

305
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,440
The shadow is a tight passage, a narrow door whose painful constriction no one has spared

306
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,840
who goes down to the deep well, end quote.

307
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,320
In order to understand how the shadow makes itself felt in our daily lives, it is essential

308
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,720
that we understand Jung's concept of projection.

309
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,400
Consciousness naturally raises certain aspects of the self into a state of conscious sovereignty,

310
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,760
and so long as the conscious persona is healthy, functioning, flourishing, those unconscious

311
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,720
contents which are unacceptable for the social life are deprived of energy, so to speak,

312
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,840
they're kept subordinated.

313
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,480
But if the conscious domain of the psyche becomes unbalanced, unhealthy in some way,

314
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,040
is challenged or disturbed in some serious way, those unconscious complexes will start

315
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,360
to take charge of it, and furthermore the unconscious contents are experienced as something

316
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,120
foreign to the conscious self.

317
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:25,560
Jung writes quote, the collective unconscious is anything but an encapsulated personal system.

318
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:31,280
It is sheer objectivity, as wide as the world and open to all the world.

319
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,160
There I am the object of every subject, in complete reversal of my ordinary consciousness

320
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,520
where I am always the subject that has an object, end quote.

321
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,760
And so, when someone's unacceptable unconscious content that Jung calls their shadow begins

322
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,720
to make itself forceful over the conscious personality, it is natural that we should

323
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,720
experience this as something external, that we should therefore project that feeling,

324
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,200
that complex, that type, onto the external world.

325
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,680
Jung clarifies in one section that this term projection should not be taken to mean that

326
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,520
the psyche has actually reached out into the objective world and exercised a power over

327
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,000
the external.

328
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,960
He says another term one could use for projection would be introjection, the use of external

329
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,280
objects or entities to symbolize some process which is actually internal to the subject,

330
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,640
that really we're not so much pitching the psyche out with projection so much as we are

331
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,040
bringing the external in.

332
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,640
So for an example of the shadow crashing into the psyche of an otherwise healthy mind,

333
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,720
suppose we have an individual who feels that aggressiveness and competition, whether it

334
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,040
be sports or one's career or simply social life in general, that it's inappropriate

335
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,320
and it's mean spirited, that one should not ever express hostility towards one's fellow

336
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,960
competitors, you should comport yourself with a kind of mutual respect.

337
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,720
You would probably all say these are admirable values for one to hold, but perhaps we can

338
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,160
imagine someone who feels this value of a desire for mutual respect and competition

339
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:15,240
so strongly that he always suspects that his competitors are hostile toward him.

340
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,600
When he loses on the football field, he assumes his opponents must be putting his team down

341
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
in their own locker room after the game.

342
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,160
When a coworker passes him and gets the promotion, he assumes that this person secretly hates

343
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
him or looks down upon him.

344
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,400
And accordingly, because all of our sportsmanship is just a false veneer in the first place,

345
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,200
perhaps he ends up feeling that hostility towards all of his competitors around him.

346
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,240
This fills him with a sense of guilt, but he reminds himself that it's really the fault

347
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,160
of all of those around him who have disrespected him over the years.

348
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,480
A Jungian might look at such a person and see that he's become possessed by his shadow

349
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,400
to some extent.

350
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,960
And in this process, he is experienced as something foreign, something alien to his

351
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,640
ego consciousness.

352
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,880
With all of his moral pretensions, that mutual respect is the basis of all friendly competition,

353
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,960
but he always projects his own shadow onto the behaviors of his friends and his coworkers.

354
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,880
The fact that it is really he who feels this deep hostility and disrespect towards others

355
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,800
is masked by this projection and it becomes a way for him to deal with the guilt that

356
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
he feels for feeling that way.

357
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,880
All of this would be in the patient's shadow self.

358
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,960
Jung gives an explanation in broad, somewhat poetic terms of what the person possessed

359
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,280
by the shadow or by their quote, inferior functions is like.

360
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:42,920
This is in concerning rebirth paragraph 222 of archetypes and the collective unconscious

361
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,720
quote.

362
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,680
The inferior function is practically identical with the dark side of the human personality,

363
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,280
the darkness which clings to every personality is the door into the unconscious and the gateway

364
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:01,160
of our dreams, from which those two twilight figures, the shadow and the anima, step into

365
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,440
our nightly visions, or remaining invisible take possession of our ego consciousness.

366
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,240
A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into

367
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,320
his own traps.

368
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,960
Whenever possible, he prefers to make an unfavorable impression on others.

369
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,840
In the long run, luck is always against him because he is living below his own level,

370
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,080
and at best only attains what does not suit him.

371
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,240
And if there is no doorstep for him to stumble over, he manufactures one for himself and then

372
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,600
fondly believes he has done something useful.

373
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,280
Jung mentions the anima there, which we will address in a little bit, but the main thing

374
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,240
to remember about the shadow, it's the unacceptable side of ourselves, which nevertheless exists

375
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,920
and sometimes motivates our actions and that we therefore project onto the external in order

376
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,280
to deal with the cognitive dissonance that that brings.

377
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,520
We would sooner see the contents of our own shadow in our friends, in our neighbors, in

378
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,040
our interlocutors than in ourselves, and such a person who is possessed by their shadow

379
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,800
will consequently bring forth the very aspect of himself that he despises and then experience

380
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
it as something alien.

381
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,920
We will get in our own way and then perceive that obstacle as the other.

382
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,040
In dreams, the shadow can appear as numerous images, sometimes as a hostile animal or a

383
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,120
predator, sometimes as a primitive human being.

384
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,520
The shadow appears throughout the mythology of mankind as an adversary or as a dark inversion

385
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,640
of the heroic figure.

386
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,720
Because the origin of these unacceptable drives or impulses is within our animal nature, the

387
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,320
association of the shadow with less conscious animals or more instinctive forms of life

388
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,000
seems somewhat obvious.

389
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,840
But in many cultures, Jung argues, the shadow appears in the mythology as a trickster figure.

390
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,920
Such a figure is something of a riddle because the trickster entities of many religions and

391
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,800
superstitious traditions is a sort of mixed and paradoxical character.

392
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,720
Jung says that there is something of the trickster in the image of the shaman and the medicine

393
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,320
man, the wild figure who lives at the boundaries of society but has a connection with the world

394
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,960
of spirits.

395
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,720
The poltergeist is another such example within popular folklore, in this case of a trickster

396
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,200
spirit.

397
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,280
Jung also brings up the contradictoryness of the trickster in European folklore in the

398
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,200
form of the devil, regarded as the ape of God, who is sometimes portrayed in the legends

399
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,440
as a simpleton who is easily fooled or cheated by ordinary human beings.

400
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,560
There are also the figures out of folktales such as Tom Thumb or Stupid Hans and one

401
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,440
of Grimm's fairy tales, the spirit Mercurius, who takes his name from the Greek god Mercury,

402
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,800
is outwitted by a simple peasant.

403
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:03,240
Jung argues in his essay Psychology of the Trickster Figure that quote, if the myth were

404
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,680
nothing but an historical remnant, one would have to ask why it has not long since vanished

405
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,320
into the great rubbish heap of the past.

406
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,160
Instead, the trickster still fascinates us, whether it's Mephisto and Goethe's Faust,

407
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:25,760
Loki and the Norse myths, or for that matter, Loki in the latest Marvel production, or in

408
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,760
the horror stories of poltergeists and other such mischievous spirits.

409
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,000
Jung references the strange European tradition of celebrating the trickster.

410
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,560
Jung believes that these fests and carnivals were in some sense rooted in the Roman holiday

411
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,960
of Saturnalia, in which societal roles were reversed, slaves ordered around their masters,

412
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
and so on.

413
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,760
In medieval Europe, the New Year was celebrated with singing and dancing, called the Fool's

414
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Feast.

415
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,520
In the year 1198, apparently the festivities got so out of hand that Pope Innocent III

416
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:09,360
railed against the, quote, gests and madness that make the clergy a mockery, end quote,

417
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,840
and the, quote, shameless frenzy of their play acting, end quote.

418
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,280
And even 200 years later, a letter to the theological faculty of Paris complained that

419
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,520
even the clergy was getting involved with these Fool's Feasts and that they were farcically

420
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,520
electing a Fool's Pope during these festivities.

421
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:35,000
There was also the Festum Assenorum, the Ass Festival, or Donkey Festival.

422
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,520
As Jung mentions, this is referenced by Nietzsche himself and thus spoke Zarathustra, the chapter

423
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,520
named the Ass Festival, and in Jung's estimation that chapter of Zarathustra is, quote, a deliberately

424
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,840
blasphemous parody of the mass, end quote.

425
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,240
As Jung explains, we cannot source this apparently farcical celebration to Nietzsche himself.

426
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,080
These strange ecclesiastical customs are the organic products of the Middle Ages.

427
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,920
A procession of men marched with a donkey, decked with a golden canopy, and they marched

428
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,600
all the way into the church, and there the priest would conclude mass by braying three

429
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:18,600
times, like a donkey, and the priests and archbishops then played a ballgame inside

430
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
the church.

431
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,860
Jung writes, quote, in picker-esque tales and carnivals and revels, and magic rites of

432
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:31,320
healing and man's religious fears and exaltations, the phantom of the trickster haunts the mythology

433
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,560
of all ages, sometimes in quite unmistakable form, sometimes in strangely modified guise,

434
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,120
end quote, and a bit further in the essay Jung continues, quote, the trickster motif

435
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,760
does not crop up only in its mythical form, but appears just as naively and authentically

436
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,400
in the unsuspecting modern man.

437
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,120
Whenever in fact he feels himself at the mercy of annoying, quote, accidents, which thwart

438
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:04,400
his will and his actions with apparently malicious intent, he then speaks of, quote, hoodos

439
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,200
and jinxes, or of the mischievousness of the object.

440
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,320
Here the trickster is represented by counter tendencies in the unconscious, and in certain

441
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,640
cases by a sort of second personality of a purile and inferior character, not unlike

442
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,120
the personalities who announce themselves at spiritualistic sciences, and cause all those

443
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,520
ineffably childish phenomena so typical of poltergeists.

444
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,720
I have, I think, found a suitable designation for this character component when I called

445
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
it the shadow.

446
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,720
On the civilized level, it is regarded as a personal gaffe, slip, faux pas, etc., which

447
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,960
are then chalked up as defects of the conscious personality.

448
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,920
We are no longer aware that in carnival customs and the like, there are remnants of a collective

449
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,000
shadow figure which proved that the personal shadow is in part descended from a numinous

450
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,200
collective figure, end quote.

451
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,760
Just a few observations about that.

452
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:10,120
To this very day, people reference the legend of gremlins, which was very popular apparently

453
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,920
during Air Force pilots during World War II.

454
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,040
If they have random problems with a part or something of that nature, they'd say, oh,

455
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:24,120
the gremlins, these little malicious elves who get into the machinery and mess it up.

456
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,760
I still will say that phrase myself, and I know people will use it of like, oh, damn

457
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,040
gremlins, right?

458
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,840
When it's just apparently a random accident, we'll attribute it to a mischievous little

459
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:44,240
elf or a mischievous little fiend, or as Jung says, something of a purile and inferior

460
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,640
character.

461
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,880
And furthermore, Jung brings up toward the end there of gaffes, slips, a faux pas.

462
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:01,000
What is the Freudian slip, finding its way into Jung's psychology to some extent, that

463
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,880
the slips, the gaffes, the mistakes we make when we say the reverse of what we mean to

464
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,400
say, or an unwanted, inappropriate word finds its way into our speech, that what's happening

465
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,560
there is a slippage of the unacceptable contents of consciousness, or of unconsciousness that

466
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,920
the consciousness has suppressed, i.e. the shadow, that's what the Freudian slip is.

467
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,040
Now, the trickster as a figure, when it's treated as a collective figure in the mythology,

468
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,640
it's paradoxical because as Jung points out, in some respects, he's stupider than the animals.

469
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,720
He gets himself into trouble again and again in the fairy tales, and is seemingly helpless

470
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,400
in this.

471
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,800
Even though the shadow as trickster figure is not necessarily evil, quote, he does the

472
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,520
most atrocious things from sheer unconsciousness and unrelatedness, end quote.

473
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:02,200
And yet, the trickster, such as when he appears in the form of Mercurius, is he from whom

474
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,840
mortal man could win the magic power of healing.

475
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,640
The trickster in Jung's view is a prefiguration of the savior figure, because he leads man

476
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,160
on his way from a placid state of ignorance about his animal nature.

477
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,680
He gives us the red pill to use modern language about our animal nature, rather than, we might

478
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,760
say, the naive notion of the supremacy of consciousness.

479
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,720
Jung writes, quote, the trickster is a primitive cosmic being of a divine animal nature, on

480
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,280
the one hand superior to man because of his superhuman qualities, and on the other hand

481
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,160
inferior to him because of his unreason and his unconsciousness, end quote.

482
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,360
Also to recapitulate, Jung asserts that the first thing we have to confront as we begin

483
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:56,440
to integrate what is unconscious in the psyche into the conscious mind is those unacceptable

484
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,880
animal impulses within us.

485
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,160
And in fact, we find that much of our behavior is driven by these impulses, as Freud argued.

486
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,720
In fact, you could say all of our impulses have this animal origin.

487
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,800
But because we've gone through the process of civilization, we've become afflicted with

488
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,160
this kind of amnesia, where certain aspects have been suppressed, and the shadow is a

489
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,880
terrifying reminder that they're still there, even though they've been subordinated, and

490
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,040
they're right beneath the surface.

491
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,960
And therefore, we portray that figure as a paradoxical half god, half animal, something

492
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,760
that both lies beneath our humanity and beckons us to what might be above our humanity as

493
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,360
it is now.

494
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,920
Because the confrontation with the shadow is that first encounter with the unconscious,

495
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,760
which is the beginning of the psychic work needed in order to fully integrate and understand

496
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
oneself.

497
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,440
Still, the shadow is an incredibly dangerous thing.

498
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,360
It may be precisely because we have ceased to pay the collective shadow its due, that

499
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,360
the shadow might even pose more danger now than ever.

500
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,060
This is a recurring theme with Jung.

501
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:13,100
That which we do not bring into consciousness, or that which tries to breach into consciousness

502
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,780
and that we continually attempt to ignore, that is always what poses the most frightful

503
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,540
danger, whatever it is that remains in the dark.

504
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,640
Jung writes, quote, the so-called civilized man has forgotten the trickster.

505
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,880
He remembers him only figuratively and metaphorically when irritated by his own ineptitude.

506
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,580
He speaks of fate playing tricks on him or of things being bewitched.

507
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,740
He never suspects that his own hidden and apparently harmless shadow has qualities whose dangerousness

508
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,780
exceeds his wildest dreams.

509
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:54,000
As soon as people get together in masses and submerge the individual, the shadow is mobilized,

510
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,940
and as history shows, may even be personified and incarnated, end quote.

511
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:07,360
This is part of how Jung understands the psychology of crowds, what we might call mass psychology,

512
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,360
and it entails a real consequence if we fail to understand the archetypal contents of the

513
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
psyche.

514
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:20,080
Because when lots of individuals aggregate together, what happens is not an ever more

515
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:26,440
multifarious expression of their individuality, but a race to the most universal thought patterns

516
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,320
and complexes.

517
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,880
That's what overwhelms the individuality of each member.

518
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:37,940
As all of this unconscious content is collective, those archetypes of the collective unconsciousness

519
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:43,460
will begin to more strongly express themselves the more powerful the collective is, the more

520
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:49,220
overwhelming it is, the more the ego consciousness is submerged within the multitude.

521
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,180
Jung believed this was a large part of the psychology of the dangerous collectivist movements

522
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,980
in Europe at that time.

523
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,840
Just as a man who is not integrated as shadow might project that individual shadow onto

524
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:11,000
his neighbor, so too might an entire society construct a collective shadow, quote, in consequence

525
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,680
of the increasing repression and neglect of the original mythologians as a corresponding

526
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,280
projection on other social groups and nations, end quote.

527
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,880
Now, as the shadow is only a gateway into this world of the unconscious, we might wonder

528
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,440
about some of these other archetypes.

529
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,580
We've already mentioned one of them, the anima.

530
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:39,820
Jung argues that the anima, like all of these other figures, is not sheer mythology, which

531
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,420
he names as a constant prejudice of so-called scientifically-minded men whenever they encounter

532
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,620
his theories.

533
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:50,620
He argues that, quote, the concept of the anima is a purely empirical concept, whose

534
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,600
sole purpose is to give a name to a group of related or analogous psychic phenomena.

535
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,400
The concept does no more and means no more than, shall we say, the concept anthropods,

536
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,320
which includes all animals with articulated body and limbs, and so gives a name to this

537
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,160
phenomenological group, end quote.

538
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,120
This passage is useful, not just for understanding how Jung thinks about the anima, but how he

539
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,920
thinks about all of these archetypes, even though he constantly brings in the content

540
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,060
of myths and of dreams and of fantasies.

541
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:27,860
The point is to notice similarities across all of these and across individuals and cultures,

542
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:33,220
to classify these so-called dreams and fantasies as definite types, and therefore to have a

543
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,660
basis for inquiring empirically about these types.

544
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,380
Jung explains the anima in the essay, Arc Types of the Collective Unconscious, in this

545
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,940
passage, quote, whoever looks into the water sees his own image, but behind it living creatures

546
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,160
soon loom up.

547
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,400
Fish is presumably harmless dwellers of the deep, harmless if only the lake were not haunted.

548
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,880
They are water beings of a peculiar sort.

549
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:07,000
Sometimes a nixie gets into the fisherman's net, a female half-human fish.

550
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,620
These are entrancing creatures.

551
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:15,020
Half drew she him, half sank he down, and never more was seen.

552
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,780
The nixie is an even more instinctive version of a magical feminine being whom I call the

553
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,940
anima.

554
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:28,940
She can also be a siren, a mermaid, wood nymph, grace, or irkling's daughter, or alamia

555
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:35,740
or succubus, who infatuates young men and sucks the life out of them, end quote.

556
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,160
So all of these mythical figures, the nixie, the siren, the succubus, these beings are

557
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,280
a source of infatuation, but they're also a source of fear.

558
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,400
The anima is beautiful and yet dreadful.

559
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,600
Jung writes that many would dismiss such figures as merely flights of fancy, worthless, erotic

560
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,600
fantasies.

561
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:01,480
And he admits there is some truth to this, but it is not the whole truth, for such fantasies

562
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,720
are not explained merely by calling them fantasies.

563
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,100
And may, quote, complicate our psychic life in a most painful way.

564
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:16,460
She comes upon us just as a nixie might, she sits on top of us like a succubus, she changes

565
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:22,620
into all sorts of shapes, like a witch, and in general displays an unbearable independence

566
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,780
that does not seem at all proper in a psychic content, end quote.

567
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,420
These types of myths appear all over the world and are probably relatively familiar

568
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,400
to most of us.

569
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,640
Jung uses the term anima because the meaning of anima is soul, to which the German word

570
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,560
seal is related.

571
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,520
If we trace the etymology of this word to its Greek origins, we find its meaning as

572
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,920
quick moving, changeful of hue, twinkling, likened to the butterfly.

573
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,880
The soul is the breath, the magic breath that animates living beings.

574
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,880
That which has soul is spirited, it is moving.

575
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:07,180
Accordingly, Jung writes that the anima, quote, makes us believe incredible things that life

576
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,940
may be lived, end quote.

577
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,060
And we might think here of Schopenhauer's view of the feminine, tied in with his view

578
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:20,060
of women, as that which seduces us to continue pursuing the will to live.

579
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,060
Jung says that the anima, the feminine representation of the soul, is that which continually ensnares

580
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,620
us, bringing us back to earth, back to nature.

581
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,680
In fact, one can find such a representation of the feminine as both alluring and deadly

582
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,960
in the very Judaic creation myth found in Genesis.

583
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,080
Eve must convince Adam to eat of the forbidden fruit along with her.

584
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:48,120
Of course, in the Jewish and in the Christian religious morality, this makes Eve the first

585
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,760
sinner and Adam along with her.

586
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,840
But Jung also brings out this element that the feminine spurs man on to his betterment

587
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:01,900
to his elevation, which is sort of at tension with that, and perhaps a literalist take on

588
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,360
the biblical creation myth.

589
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,660
That's a theme in Goethe's Faust as well.

590
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,420
It is in fact the final couplet of the play sung by the Chorus Mysticus, quote, the eternal

591
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,780
feminine lures to perfection, end quote.

592
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,620
And that connection is not lost on Jung, who would argue that Goethe's play is just as

593
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,640
much an expression of these unconscious contents as any of our myths or ancient rituals were.

594
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Faust is the man who has ever drawn forward with his insatiable thirst for life, never

595
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,520
satisfied.

596
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,320
And the thing that draws him forward, whether it is Gretchen as he sees her image in the

597
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:45,440
witches' mirror, or the image of Helen of Troy conjured into the modern day, it's the

598
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:51,460
feminine that represents that for which Faust is always striving but can never reach.

599
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,340
Helen of Troy quite literally transfigures into a cloud that Faust then grabs hold of

600
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,080
and then rises up into the heavens.

601
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,840
Jung quotes La Rochefoucault, who writes accordingly, quote, were it not for the leaping and twinkling

602
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:12,840
of the soul, man would rot away in his greatest passion, idleness, end quote.

603
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:19,540
Jung clarifies that he does not call the anima the soul in the sense of the immortal soul

604
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,120
found in, for example, the Catholic doctrine.

605
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:28,620
Jung refers us instead to classical sources such as Microbius or to the Taoist religion

606
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:35,120
and the philosophical system of classical Chinese thought, wherein the Po, or the Kuei,

607
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,320
quote, is regarded as the feminine and cathonic part of the soul, end quote.

608
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,200
Jung writes of the anima in archetypes of the collective unconscious, quote, it is a

609
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:52,560
factor in the proper sense of the word, man cannot make it, on the contrary, it is always

610
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,400
the a priori element in his moods, reactions, impulses, or whatever else is spontaneous

611
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,900
in psychic life, it is something that lives of itself, that makes us live, it is a life

612
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,720
behind consciousness that cannot be completely integrated with it, but from which, on the

613
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,840
contrary, consciousness arises.

614
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:18,400
For in the last analysis, psychic life is for the greater part an unconscious life that

615
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,640
surrounds consciousness on all sides.

616
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,720
Although it seems as if the whole of our unconscious psychic life could be ascribed to the anima,

617
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,360
she is yet only one archetype among many, therefore she is not characteristic of the

618
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,560
unconscious in its entirety, she is only one of its aspects.

619
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,000
This is shown by the very factor for femininity.

620
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,800
What is not I, not masculine, is most probably feminine, and because the not I is felt as

621
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,880
not belonging to me, and therefore as outside me, the anima image is usually projected upon

622
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,600
women.

623
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,240
Either sex is inhabited by the opposite sex up to a point.

624
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,680
For biologically speaking, it is simply the greater number of masculine genes that tips

625
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,800
the scales in favor of masculinity.

626
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,840
The smaller number of feminine genes seems to form a feminine character which usually

627
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,000
remains unconscious because of its subordinate position.

628
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,040
With the archetype of the anima, we enter the realm of gods, or rather the realm that

629
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,320
metaphysics has reserved for itself.

630
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:27,160
Everything the anima touches becomes numinous, unconditional, dangerous, taboo, magical.

631
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,400
She is the serpent in the paradise of the harmless man with good resolutions and still

632
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,400
better intentions.

633
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,080
She affords the most convincing reasons for not prying into the unconscious, an occupation

634
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:44,040
that would break down our moral inhibitions and unleash forces that had been better left

635
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,880
unconscious and undisturbed.

636
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,200
End quote.

637
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,680
So a few observations that many of you have probably already taken note of.

638
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,720
For one, Jung's assessment of this first major character within the metaphysical world of

639
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,680
the collective unconscious is that its gender is going to be the opposite of the conscious

640
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
subject.

641
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,600
So in the case of women, they would not possess an anima but an animus.

642
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,960
The anima for men or animus for women is called the soul because it's the strongest, most

643
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,760
powerful subpersonality within the unconscious contents, the most powerful factor in determining

644
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,960
our thoughts and actions.

645
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:25,040
It's the cathonic part of the soul because it's buried beneath the surface of consciousness,

646
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:31,080
but it remains soul, the thing that animates, that draws us forward, seduces us to life.

647
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,280
It is our image of the opposite gender contained within ourselves.

648
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,400
And usually, as with the shadow, we never consciously perceive this psychic force.

649
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,880
And thus we project it onto the opposite sex.

650
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,120
A man will project onto women his image of the feminine, which is something coming from

651
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,200
deep within his own unconsciousness and representative of his own wants and fears.

652
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,320
And then he'll experience his own image of the feminine as something outside of himself,

653
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,720
something not me.

654
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,960
Jung relates a number of religious visions from Christian figures, including a Cistercian

655
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:10,040
monk in the 1300s and a Swiss mystic in the 1500s, in which they saw, alongside God the

656
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:17,280
Father, God the Mother, or alongside the King of Heaven, the Queen of Heaven.

657
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,720
Such visions were completely inexplicable within the religious framework of European

658
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,080
Christianity at that time.

659
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:30,320
Such feminine interpretations of the divine had long since been excised from European

660
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,160
religious thought, and God was the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, a trinity which

661
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,560
is holy male.

662
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,320
I mean, maybe there's some ambiguity with the Holy Spirit, but there's not a whole

663
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,280
lot of female energy in that metaphor.

664
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,720
So where did such visions come from, in which a holy man in Europe is confronted with the

665
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,920
divine as female?

666
00:52:52,920 --> 00:53:00,000
Again, independently of tradition, we have records of such Cisigistic visions.

667
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,560
Cisigy is the conjunction of two apparently opposite aspects, in this case the masculine

668
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,280
and feminine as both perceived as divine.

669
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:16,000
It's only natural that these two should appear as a mother-father pair, as they often do,

670
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,080
and this is what is signified by God the Father and God the Mother.

671
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,600
It should be noted at this point that this is Jung's way of dealing with the insights

672
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,920
of Freud of incorporating what Freud had learned about the centrality of the family relationships

673
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,800
to our psychic life, but without elevating the relationship with one's father and mother

674
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,880
to the status of ultimate importance, as if the actual tangible father and mother in your

675
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,480
upbringing are the determinative thing of how your psyche operates.

676
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,120
That there is this collective unconscious contents of the image of the father, the image

677
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,880
of the mother.

678
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,480
In effect, the mother complex is another manifestation of the anima, another mask or face of the

679
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:04,000
anima, because the anima is a numinous and alluring thing, the cathonic soul within a

680
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,080
young man or a young boy will naturally project the anima at first onto his mother.

681
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,680
The natural thing, however, is for the anima image to gradually lose its grandeur over the

682
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,880
course of growing up, and eventually, when we come to understand our parents as just

683
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:27,120
being ordinary human beings, and over time the anima sinks back into the unconsciousness,

684
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:33,080
although Jung argues it loses none of its tension or its productivity.

685
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:39,800
Jung then discusses the psychic effects it would have on a man to project his anima archetype

686
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,640
in light of this.

687
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,920
This is in, concerning the archetypes and the anima concept, quote,

688
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,720
The love life of a man reveals the psychology of this archetype in the form either of boundless

689
00:54:52,720 --> 00:55:00,720
fascination, overvaluation, and infatuation, or of misogyny in all its gradations and variants,

690
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,160
none of which can be explained by the real nature of the quote object in question, but

691
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,840
only by a transference of the mother complex.

692
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,360
The complex, however, was caused in the first place by the assimilation of the mother, in

693
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:19,200
itself a normal and ubiquitous phenomenon, to the pre-existent feminine side of an archetypal

694
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,960
male-female pair of opposites, and secondly by an abnormal delay in detaching from the

695
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,240
primordial image of the mother.

696
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,320
Actually nobody can stand the total loss of the archetype.

697
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,680
When that happens, it gives rise to that frightful discontent in our culture where nobody feels

698
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,000
at home because a father and mother are always missing.

699
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,080
End quote, and a bit further in the essay Jung writes, quote,

700
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:51,600
The anima is a factor of utmost importance in the psychology of a man, wherever the emotions

701
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,600
and affects are at work.

702
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:00,360
She intensifies, exaggerates, falsifies, and mythologizes all emotional relations with

703
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,880
his work and with other people of both sexes.

704
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,480
The resultant fantasies and entanglements are all her doing.

705
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,640
When the anima is strongly constellated, she softens the man's character and makes him

706
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,840
touchy, irritable, moody, jealous, vain, and unadjusted.

707
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,360
End quote.

708
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,240
So you may have also noted thus far Jung says that completely integrating one's anima is

709
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,400
an impossible task.

710
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,760
The well of the soul is very deep.

711
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,560
No matter how fully you try to bring it into consciousness, some of it always recedes back

712
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,280
into the depths of the mind.

713
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,200
And so it should be, right?

714
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,120
Because to become fully identified with this subordinate unconscious personality would

715
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,680
not be a good idea.

716
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,560
It would be the destruction of your actual conscious personality.

717
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,240
But it's also not a good idea to completely banish these archetypes from our cultural

718
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:05,960
or spiritual lexicon, to attempt to excise them or to smother them entirely in unconsciousness.

719
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,480
And Jung does say that for young men, those who are 35 and younger, the most important

720
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:16,640
thing in his view is for a man to be a man, and that they can live with even the almost

721
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,160
total destruction of the anima.

722
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,680
It may be different, he admits, with artists and other such types who might need the anima

723
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,520
for their work, but it's primarily as a man begins to get older that the loss of the anima

724
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,280
becomes particularly dangerous.

725
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,280
Quote,

726
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,840
After the middle of life, permanent loss of the anima means a diminution of vitality,

727
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,600
of flexibility, and of human kindness.

728
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:48,600
The result as a rule is premature, rigidity, crustiness, stereotypy, fanatical one-sidedness,

729
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:56,600
obstinacy, pedantry, or else resignation, weariness, sloppiness, irresponsibility.

730
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,680
What one realizes over the course of studying archetypes is that Jung truly thinks that

731
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,400
these are independent sub-personalities.

732
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,280
They have their own life and character.

733
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,600
One has to reconcile with them to some extent, which means recognizing their existence and

734
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,880
the role they play in your psychic life, but to become completely identified with an archetype

735
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,400
would be just as catastrophic as trying to go to war with it.

736
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,760
As you may have gleaned, neither of the types we've considered so far, the shadow or the

737
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,200
anima, can be considered as wholly positive or wholly negative.

738
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,800
As terrifying as the shadow is, as the trickster, he's a sort of gateway to the ideal self,

739
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,960
to the savior or the redeemer.

740
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:48,960
The anima draws forward the subject into the unknown, into the unknown seas, but also threatens

741
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,520
the subject with the danger of drowning.

742
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,800
So these types are multifaceted and they also have multiple faces to them that express different

743
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,640
aspects of the archetype.

744
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,680
So the great mother archetype is a subset of the anima, which could appear as one's

745
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,920
personal mother or grandmother, she can appear as the mother of God, as the virgin, or as

746
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,240
Sophia.

747
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,120
These are all generally positive.

748
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,440
These are inspiring forms of the mother type.

749
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,280
But Jung writes, quote, all these symbols can have a positive favorable meaning or a

750
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,440
negative evil meaning.

751
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:29,720
An ambivalent aspect is seen in the goddesses of fate, Moira, Grashe, Norns.

752
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,320
Evil symbols are the witch, the dragon, or any devouring or entwining animal, such as

753
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:45,400
a large fish or serpent, the grave, sarcophagus, deep water, deep nightmares and bogies, impusa,

754
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,240
lilyth, etc.

755
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:54,080
The relationship that one will have with such archetypes will reflect their psychological

756
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,280
realities and the realities of their own lives.

757
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,680
And oftentimes the appearance of such a symbol is an unconscious hint as to some imbalance

758
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,880
or pathology.

759
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:11,080
If one is having repeated visitations of Mahakali in their dreams, constantly experiencing the

760
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:16,400
great mother as something terrible and all devouring, it may be an indication of anima

761
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,000
inflation in the person's psychology.

762
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,840
The sub-personality of the anima becoming all-conquering and unchallenged and beginning

763
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:30,200
to dominate and to push the conscious subject's behavior in ways that might not even be perceptible

764
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,280
to him.

765
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:37,040
We'll consider a few other important archetypes that Jung identifies.

766
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:43,000
Jung writes, quote, the archetype of the child god is extremely widespread and intimately

767
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,840
bound up with all the other mythological aspects of the child motif, end quote.

768
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:54,400
Of course, in European Christianity we have the symbolism of the Christ child, to which

769
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:00,280
we return every Christmas, it's a celebration of God's birth on earth where we see God

770
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,480
as the child.

771
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:08,800
Jung also, however, brings in a discussion of folklore, of dwarves and elves and little

772
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,960
people who inhabit the deep places and the mine shafts.

773
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,880
And on the other hand, the child appears as a recurring theme in mystical experience,

774
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,040
Meister Eckhart's vision of the naked boy.

775
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,880
It appears in English ghost stories, the apparition of the radiant boy.

776
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:32,480
Jung writes in psychology of the child archetype, quote, the child motif not infrequently occurs

777
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,600
in the field of psychopathology.

778
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,320
The quote imaginary child is common among women with mental disorders and is usually

779
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,040
interpreted in a Christian sense.

780
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,560
Hamonkili also appear, as in the famous Schreiber case, where they come in swarms and plague

781
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,560
the sufferer.

782
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:55,520
But the clearest and most significant manifestation of the child motif in the therapy of neuroses

783
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:02,000
is in the maturation process of personality induced by the analysis of the unconscious,

784
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,800
which I have termed the process of individuation.

785
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,440
Here we are confronted with pre-conscious processes, which in the form of more or less

786
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,720
well-formed fantasies gradually pass over into the conscious mind, or become conscious

787
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:22,440
as dreams, or lastly, are made conscious through the method of active imagination.

788
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:28,560
This material is rich in archetypal motifs, among them frequently that of the child.

789
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,320
Often the child is formed after the Christian model, more often though it develops from

790
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,400
earlier altogether non-Christian levels.

791
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:43,000
That is to say, out of catholic animals, such as crocodiles, dragons, serpents, or monkeys.

792
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,840
Sometimes the child appears in the cup of a flower, or out of a golden egg, or as the

793
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,000
center of a mandala.

794
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:55,560
In dreams it often appears as the dreamer's son or daughter, or as a boy, youth, or young

795
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,560
girl.

796
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:02,120
Occasionally it seems to be of exotic origin, Indian or Chinese, with a dusky skin, or appearing

797
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:07,720
more cosmically surrounded by stars, or with a starry coronet, or as the king's son, or

798
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,360
the witch's child with demonic attributes.

799
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:17,000
Seen as a special instance of the treasure hard to attain motif, the child motif is extremely

800
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:23,240
variable, and assumes all manner of shapes, such as the jewel, the pearl, the flower,

801
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,320
the chalice, the golden egg, the quaternity, the golden ball, and so on.

802
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,320
It can be interchanged with these, and similar images almost without limit.

803
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,200
So what are we to make of a passage like this?

804
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:44,480
On the one hand, Jung seems to include so many images of the child archetype, that it's

805
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,520
very coherence might seem to be hard to grasp.

806
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,840
On the other hand, what Jung is doing here is pointing to, in his view, an irrational

807
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:58,940
and arbitrary series of associations that the psyche has made between seemingly unrelated

808
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,760
objects or symbols.

809
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,280
That this is really what we might call poetic license.

810
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,680
It's one of the main things that seems to differentiate our thought as human beings.

811
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,680
We have the capability to make poetic leaps, but what this involves is associating two

812
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:21,360
different phenomena by way of metaphor, and the unconscious is similarly artistic in this

813
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,360
way.

814
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,000
It makes these metaphorical associations.

815
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,120
As the child archetype is the treasure hard to attain, the child could appear as a radiant

816
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,280
jewel or as a radiant infant.

817
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:39,640
Jung believes that the child archetype appears when one has, in some way, sundered themselves

818
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,560
from their own character.

819
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:47,040
What he means by this is that we can occasionally act in ways that accord more with an arbitrary

820
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:51,800
persona that we have adopted than in line with our actual values.

821
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:56,280
The way that we feel we should act, deep in our gut and our intuition.

822
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,920
The demands of the social life lead us to adopt such arbitrary personas, a mask that

823
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:08,200
one puts on due to the requirements of his job or his social relationships or his church

824
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,800
or his marriage and family life, whatever it might be.

825
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,120
We might be forced to make ourselves appear as something that we're not, and so far as

826
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,600
our inner feelings might be completely at odds with our outward persona.

827
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:27,400
If we then act according to the needs or desires of this artificial character that we've created,

828
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,760
we may then encounter the child archetype.

829
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:37,480
Jung says that one sees the child, for example, in dreams, when he becomes, quote, unchildlike

830
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:44,280
and artificial, end quote, and when he, quote, has lost his roots, end quote.

831
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:51,000
The thing hard to attain, then, somewhat conjures the imagery of one's childhood.

832
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,960
But Jung argues this is not purely a yearning for some romantic version of one's youth

833
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,360
or one's childhood days.

834
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:04,400
Jung says that, quote, the child motif represents not only something that existed in the distant

835
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,520
past, but also something that exists now, that is to say, it is not just a vestige but

836
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:15,360
a system functioning in the present, whose purpose is to compensate or correct, in a

837
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:21,520
meaningful manner, the inevitable one-sidedness and extravagances of the conscious mind, end

838
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,560
quote.

839
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:29,080
This is why the child motif occurs when patients are undergoing what Jung calls individuation.

840
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:34,680
They come to realize the ways in which artificial personas have compromised their values.

841
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:40,000
The child is a symbol of one's creativity, of the innocent self-absorption in one's

842
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,540
setting, a presentness of thought and attitude.

843
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:50,160
The child motif, therefore, suggests to us that, yes, we have lived in this manner in

844
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:55,400
the past, and that there is a possibility to return there in the future, to get it over

845
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,320
the one-sidedness, as Jung calls it.

846
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:09,280
The child, therefore, represents not the past, but the future.

847
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:15,920
The child promises some future possibility of individuation or wholeness, and, therefore,

848
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:22,100
its appearance is like Virgil appearing to Dante when he's lost in the wood of error.

849
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:25,360
The radiant child appears to you when you become lost.

850
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:31,280
The child motif, therefore, often depicts a child hero or a child god, a figure which

851
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,240
is at once vulnerable but indestructible.

852
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:41,400
He's often born into danger or privation, as Moses was placed into the river by his

853
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,280
birth mother so that he could survive, or Jesus' mother giving birth to him in a manger.

854
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,740
He's smaller than small and bigger than big at the same time.

855
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:55,940
The child is always there in our mind as an eternal warning or a sign that we have gone

856
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:00,580
astray in order that we may set right our course.

857
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:05,580
A child is vulnerable because we know that in this world we're often in real danger

858
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:10,100
of completely losing our connection to that innocence, that creativity that is the healthy

859
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,220
state of the soul.

860
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:17,580
And obviously, at this point, it bears mentioning the child is that final transfiguration of

861
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,140
the spirit in Nietzsche's schema as he gives it in Zarathustra's prologue.

862
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:28,180
And so from this, a Jungian analysis might lead us to suspect that Nietzsche gravitated

863
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:33,180
to the child motif because he unconsciously understood the role of the child as a sign

864
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:37,340
and symbol of self-transformation and individuation.

865
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:43,220
And perhaps Nietzsche was able to perceive this because he himself may have been someone

866
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:49,660
at odds with his, between his outer persona and his inner values, so to speak, perhaps

867
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:56,260
during the latter days of his teaching at Basel or his time spent among the Wagnerians.

868
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:00,340
Another important archetypal figure is the wise old man.

869
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:07,180
He can appear as an old king, a wisened magician, a father, or a grandfather.

870
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:13,980
In mythology, he is Odin, Osiris, Jupiter, arguably the image of the wise old man as

871
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:18,500
an archetype is painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

872
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:23,620
This seems to have been the archetype that Michelangelo used to portray God.

873
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:30,580
The wise old man is the superior, the master, the teacher, and in some way represents the

874
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,220
anchoring wisdom on which one's life is based.

875
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:39,620
The wise old man is the superstructure of one's thought, one's morality, their understanding

876
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:44,940
of the reality they inhabit and how they fit into that reality.

877
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:49,340
Jung says that when one's worldview, their way of comprehending themselves, is profoundly

878
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:54,820
challenged, this is often when the wise old man appears.

879
01:09:54,820 --> 01:10:00,580
Perhaps for example, when one is losing their religion, Jung relates the story of a young

880
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:07,660
theologian who had a dream in which two wise old magicians appeared to him, a white magician

881
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:11,900
wearing black robes and a black magician wearing white robes.

882
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:16,660
In the dream, the black magician tells the story of an old king from a far away land

883
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,820
who had scoured all the land searching for a tomb for himself.

884
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:24,940
In his land were many great old tombs and he wished to find the best, but when they

885
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:30,260
found one in which a virgin had been buried, they exhumed her bones.

886
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,420
His bones didn't stay dead, but got up, formed into a black horse which then galloped across

887
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:36,820
the desert.

888
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:42,300
The magician followed the horse until he found grassland and the horse grazing there.

889
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:47,600
He'd now found the keys to paradise and did not know what to do with them.

890
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,020
This is perhaps the most Jungian dream I've ever heard, so kudos to Jung for managing

891
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:56,860
to get this one from someone he says he did not even know personally, I mean it's just

892
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,660
incredible.

893
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:02,220
But in any case, this theologian was going through something in his life at the time,

894
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:07,700
which was of monumental importance, a shift or a transformation that could have life-altering

895
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,420
consequences.

896
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:16,300
That is Jung says, quote, he was in great straits because of his religious beliefs, end quote.

897
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:20,740
Which is a bit vague, but if we read between the lines, we can infer that in some ways

898
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:26,900
that theologian's beliefs probably drifted from those which were acceptable, maybe according

899
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:31,300
to the dogma of the seminary, perhaps he was losing his faith altogether, we don't really

900
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,460
know.

901
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:37,820
In any case, he was confronted with the strong drive to leave behind the current mental structure

902
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:44,220
of his worldview, to lay to rest the old king, so to speak, and thus to strike out across

903
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,140
the desert.

904
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,380
And what is it that strikes out across the desert?

905
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:53,660
Well it's the black horse, which is formed from the bones of the virgin buried in the

906
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,820
tomb in the old country.

907
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:02,140
So the anima, the soul we might say, has become dead, dry, dusty bones within the reign of

908
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,220
an old kingdom.

909
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:08,820
And once the king decided to lay himself to rest, so to speak, the soul jumps up.

910
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,500
It runs out into the unknown until it finds a new green pasture.

911
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,940
And by following it, following the drive of the soul, the black magician finds the keys

912
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:24,940
to paradise, the treasure hard to obtain, the holy grail, the return to the walled garden.

913
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:31,460
Jung writes, quote, the two magicians are indeed two aspects of the wise old man, the

914
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:36,940
superior master and teacher, the archetype of the spirit who symbolizes the pre-existent

915
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,260
meaning hidden in the chaos of life.

916
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:45,020
He is the father of the soul, and yet the soul in some miraculous manner is also his

917
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:51,940
virgin mother, for which reason he was called by the alchemists the first son of the mother.

918
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:57,300
The black magician and the black horse correspond to the descent into darkness and the dreams

919
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,300
mentioned earlier.

920
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:03,460
What an inappropriately hard lesson for a young student of theology.

921
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:07,900
Fortunately, he was not in the least sense aware that the father of all prophets had

922
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:13,220
spoken to him in the dream and placed a great secret almost within his grasp.

923
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:19,340
One marvels at the inappropriateness of such occurrences.

924
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:24,500
There is another famous idea of the archetype of the wise man that can be found in the literature,

925
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,620
and we're all familiar with it here.

926
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,380
Zarathustra himself.

927
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:34,700
Jung writes that Zarathustra is Nietzsche's psychic image of, quote, the enlightener,

928
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:39,980
the master and teacher, a psychopomp whose personification even Nietzsche, that breaker

929
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:43,780
of tablets, could not escape, end, quote.

930
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:48,540
Jung continues in the same passage, and I'm reading here in an abridged form, quote, for

931
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:54,580
him God was dead, but the driving demon of wisdom became, as it were, his bodily double.

932
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:58,420
Zarathustra is more for Nietzsche than a poetic figure.

933
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:04,460
He is an involuntary confession, a testament, end, quote.

934
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:09,380
Jung argues that in the nihilistic darkness that Nietzsche, in the wake of abandoning

935
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:17,300
God and abandoning Christianity, he created a void that required a figure that would speak

936
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:21,380
in the hieratic language of Zarathustra.

937
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:27,300
He chooses, as the image of this figure, one of the founders of the world religions, a

938
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:33,620
prophet of ancient times, a man who divided good and evil.

939
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:40,500
Zarathustra proclaims the relativity and relatedness of good and evil, and Nietzsche's version

940
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,820
of events.

941
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:46,300
This is Zarathustra as the first man to make the distinction, also being the first to realize

942
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,540
his mistake.

943
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:54,620
But we might also notice, in the dream of the theologian that Jung described, we see the

944
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:59,260
symbolism of the relativity of good and evil there, too, in the figures of the white and

945
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:05,580
black magicians, both of whom are wise men, both of whom have mismatched names.

946
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:10,980
Jung argues that this perceived interdependence of good and evil, far from being an invention

947
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:17,460
of Nietzsche's mind, is one of the oldest bits of wisdom in human religiosity.

948
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:21,820
Jung cites a saying from India that the man who loves God will take seven lifetimes to

949
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:26,660
reach perfection, while the man who hates him will take only three lifetimes.

950
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:31,180
And this is because the man who hates God will think of him more often.

951
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:36,580
Jung also suggests that this relativity, this freedom from opposition, due to a perception

952
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:42,020
of their functional equivalence, is also found in Taoist philosophy.

953
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:46,900
For that, one might look to the Zhuangzi, or to the Dao De Ching.

954
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:52,100
While this may offend mainline Christian sensibilities, there are even strains of Christian thought

955
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:56,700
in which God's allowance of evil in the world is seen as a good thing, because it allows

956
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,460
for the overcoming of sin.

957
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:06,540
Or in Hebrew, the Yatzahara, the evil inclination, the inclination of man to sin, which is considered

958
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,500
to be in itself valuable.

959
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:14,980
It was placed there by God for a good reason, because in the overcoming of sin we glorify

960
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,780
God.

961
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:21,540
Zarathustra then speaks some of that same wisdom of the ultimate relativity of good

962
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:28,220
and evil, the dependence of one upon the other, and he stands as a wise religious teacher,

963
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:30,740
in a world darkened by the death of God.

964
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:38,060
These niches creation of a mystical wise man out of a deep need, the deeply felt absence

965
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,220
of this anchoring structure for our thought.

966
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:47,500
And so Zarathustra becomes yet another figure who teaches us the pre-existent meaning behind

967
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,220
the chaos of life, which is the meaning of the wise old man.

968
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:57,340
That figure of the wise man as teacher, Jung says, is one of the type's definite aspects,

969
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:02,740
appearing in mythology as Hermes, Trismegistus, Thoth, Orpheus.

970
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:09,700
Quote, if the name Lucifer were not prejudicial, it would be a very suitable one for this archetype.

971
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:14,660
But I have been content to call it the archetype of the wise old man, or of meaning.

972
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:19,540
Like all archetypes, it has a positive and a negative aspect.

973
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,260
End quote.

974
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:28,100
Every one of these archetypes we've discussed so far has so many variations in which it

975
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,660
can appear, and there's just so much more that can be said about each of these archetypes

976
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:36,100
than could be said in a single episode.

977
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:42,340
And Jung wishes to stress that what he is imparting to us in his work is more than anything

978
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:49,100
a language, a lexicon, a kind of rough guide, a guide to the perplexed for those who wish

979
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,500
to embark on that project of individuation.

980
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,860
Moving from a state of inner turmoil to a state of health.

981
01:17:55,860 --> 01:18:00,660
Jung's understanding of the psyche is not, by any means, to be taken as a dogmatic set

982
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:05,340
of inflexible truths that we should refer to in lieu of experience.

983
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:10,300
Furthermore, he stresses that when it comes to dealing with these archetypes, these sub-complexes

984
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:16,060
of the mind, there is nothing that he can give us that will serve as an easy set of

985
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:19,420
do-it-yourself instructions that will work in all cases.

986
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,980
The concrete situation of the person is what matters.

987
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,940
Everyone has their own unique battle to fight.

988
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:30,860
Jung writes, quote, it is not sufficient just to know about these concepts and to reflect

989
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:36,300
on them, nor can we ever experience their content by feeling our way into them, or by

990
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,180
appropriating other people's feelings.

991
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:43,060
It is no use at all to learn a list of archetypes by heart.

992
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:47,820
Types are complexes of experience that come upon us like fate and their effects are felt

993
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:49,980
in our most personal life.

994
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:56,100
The anima no longer crosses our path as a goddess, but it may be as an intimately personal

995
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:00,660
misadventure, or perhaps as our best venture.

996
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:05,660
When for instance a highly esteemed professor in his seventies abandons his family and runs

997
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:11,260
off with a young red-headed actress, we know that the gods have claimed another victim.

998
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:15,100
This is how demonic power reveals itself to us.

999
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:20,620
Until not so long ago, it would have been an easy matter to do away with the young woman

1000
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:24,340
as a witch, end quote.

1001
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:29,980
And so Jung thinks that we are not in any way wiser than the type of people Jung here

1002
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:35,100
calls primitives, people who have continued to live according to the life patterns of

1003
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:41,220
say pre-industrial society, or even pre-agricultural society, who continue to see the world in

1004
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,860
terms of these myths and rituals.

1005
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:50,780
Jung writes, quote, the primitive mentality does not invent myths, it experiences them,

1006
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,460
end quote.

1007
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:55,940
Their way of thinking about their own mind is more honest than ours.

1008
01:19:55,940 --> 01:20:00,540
They still speak in a language of gods and spirits, but their understanding of the self

1009
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:07,060
is not corrupted by these modern notions of the voluntarily governing ego who lives autonomously

1010
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:10,060
and acts autonomously, thinks autonomously.

1011
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:14,340
Such a way of thinking just ignores the reality of the unconscious drives.

1012
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:20,020
And so Jung writes, and this is in Psychology of the Child archetype, paragraph 260 of the

1013
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:27,220
collected works volume 9, quote, in the individual, the archetypes appear as involuntary manifestations

1014
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:32,580
of unconscious processes whose existence and meaning can only be inferred, whereas the

1015
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:37,340
myth deals with traditional forms of incalculable age.

1016
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:42,900
They hark back to a prehistoric world whose spiritual preconceptions and general conditions

1017
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,700
we can still observe today in existing primitives.

1018
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:52,380
Myths on this level are as a rule tribal history handed down from generation to generation

1019
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,420
by word of mouth.

1020
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:59,180
Primitive mentality differs from the civilized chiefly in that the conscious mind is far

1021
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,460
less developed in scope and intensity.

1022
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:07,980
Primitives such as thinking, willing, etc. are not yet differentiated, they are pre-conscious,

1023
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:12,260
and in the case of thinking, for instance, this shows itself in the circumstance that

1024
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:17,420
the primitive does not think consciously, but that thoughts appear.

1025
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:22,500
The primitive cannot assert that he thinks, it is rather something that thinks in him.

1026
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:28,060
The spontaneity of the act of thinking does not lie causally in his conscious mind, but

1027
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:32,760
in his unconscious.

1028
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,780
This is, in effect, the Nietzschean picture of thought as well, as he discusses in Beyond

1029
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:42,500
Good and Evil, that the true vital germ of thought, even philosophical thought, is a

1030
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:49,620
drive, some sort of unconscious motivation, which may be moral or immoral, that the constitutive

1031
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:56,100
element of thought is not truth, or the will to seek the truth, but that it is the will

1032
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,940
to truth of a drive.

1033
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:03,420
Jung's further elaboration on this notion of Nietzsche's is simply that he dares to

1034
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:09,260
identify the different types of certain definite complexes of thought.

1035
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,380
We might call them complexes of feelings, or of sentiments, or of impulses, but all

1036
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:17,140
such complexes have their own form of reasoning as well.

1037
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:23,740
To return to that first essay we discussed archetypes of the collective unconscious,

1038
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:29,700
Jung makes it clear that this way of thinking, understood by the primitive mythologically,

1039
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:35,700
is how Jung would describe our thought, albeit with the modern language of psychoanalysis.

1040
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,700
Quote,

1041
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:42,540
There is no single important idea or view that does not possess historical antecedents.

1042
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:48,100
Ultimately, they are founded on primordial archetypal forms whose concreteness dates

1043
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:53,100
from a time when consciousness did not think but only perceived.

1044
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:58,420
Thoughts were objects of interperception, not thought at all but sensed as external phenomena,

1045
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,620
seen or heard, so to speak.

1046
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:05,740
Thought was essentially revelation, not invented but forced upon us, or bringing conviction

1047
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:09,140
through its immediacy and actuality.

1048
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:13,740
Thinking of this kind precedes the primitive ego consciousness, and the latter is more its

1049
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,260
object than its subject.

1050
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:21,580
But we ourselves have not yet climbed the last peak of consciousness, so we have a pre-existent

1051
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:27,180
thinking of which we are not aware so long as we are supported by traditional symbols,

1052
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:35,220
or to put it in the language of dreams, so long as the father or the king is not dead.

1053
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,780
End quote.

1054
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:44,500
What Jung offers us is, in a description that may seem somewhat reductivist or anti-climatic,

1055
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,500
a table of categories.

1056
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:51,260
And I should note, I don't mean it in a reductive way, I think his table of categories is incredibly

1057
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:56,800
useful, and that it is at least hard to argue that there aren't certain definite repeated

1058
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:01,140
types that appear in the mythic landscape of human thought.

1059
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:07,340
Many today still balk at these ideas, however, but I would simply ask, what is their alternative?

1060
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:14,060
There is no recognizable pattern, no recognizable meaning within the human psyche whatsoever.

1061
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:20,660
There's nothing that unites humanity cross-culturally, that the individual pathologies of human beings

1062
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:25,340
are so peculiar or unique or random that we can't make any descriptive sense of them

1063
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,940
at all as categories.

1064
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:33,140
I think that is, funnily enough, a fairly unscientific way of viewing the human mind,

1065
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:38,420
which is funny because people often accuse Jung of being unscientific.

1066
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:42,580
I think whether you agree with Jung or not, he provides us with a useful tool set, a useful

1067
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:47,300
lexicon for approaching the human mind, and a fascinating commentary on the relation of

1068
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:51,100
psychology to the world's religions and cultures.

1069
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:55,700
But of course Jung also relates to Nietzsche in a far deeper way than merely carrying on

1070
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,700
his influence.

1071
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:01,660
In many ways Jung was a critic of Nietzsche, he strongly disagreed with many of Nietzsche's

1072
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:06,180
moral conclusions, and furthermore he was one of the first critics to analyze Nietzsche's

1073
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:10,100
philosophy in consideration of his mental illness.

1074
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:14,340
This critical relationship between Jung and Nietzsche, however, I think is a very rich

1075
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:20,340
Much like the criticism of Socrates by Nietzsche, Jung is often times in a kind of struggle

1076
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:24,940
with Nietzsche in his writing, and even though his philosophy thoroughly rebukes the Nietzschean

1077
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:30,180
moral and cultural project, there's a sense in which Jung recognizes Nietzsche's viewpoint

1078
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:34,700
as valuable and as indispensable for the development of his own thought.

1079
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:39,340
It's in response to Nietzsche that some of Jung's most profound ideas are created.

1080
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:44,340
We're going to talk about that next time when we invite Nietzsche to come in, take a seat,

1081
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:49,340
lie down, whatever makes you more comfortable here, Nietzsche, as you're about to be psychoanalyzed.

1082
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:55,340
Join me then for Nietzsche on Jung's couch, Jung's psychoanalytic critique of Nietzsche

1083
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,340
and his ideas.

1084
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,340
Signing off.

1085
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:16,340
Or just share the show with any of your friends that you think might enjoy it or on social media.

1086
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,340
Thank you for your support.
