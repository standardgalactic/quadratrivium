00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
Quote, whether primitive or not, mankind always stands in the brink of actions it performs

00:07.040 --> 00:10.080
itself but does not control.

00:10.080 --> 00:17.040
The whole world wants peace, and the whole world prepares for war, to take but one example.

00:17.040 --> 00:23.100
Mankind is powerless against mankind, and the gods as ever show it in the ways of fate.

00:23.100 --> 00:28.400
Today we call the gods factors, which comes from facere to make.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.040
The makers stand behind the wings of the world theater.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.480
It is so in great things as in small.

00:35.480 --> 00:41.320
In the realm of consciousness we are our own masters, we seem to be the factors themselves,

00:41.320 --> 00:45.920
but if we step through the door of the shadow, we discover with terror that we are the objects

00:45.920 --> 00:48.320
of unseen factors.

00:48.320 --> 00:54.000
To know this is decidedly unpleasant, for nothing is more disillusioning than the discovery

00:54.000 --> 00:56.720
of our own inadequacy.

00:56.720 --> 01:01.480
Mankind can even give rise to primitive panic, because instead of being believed in, the

01:01.480 --> 01:06.320
anxiously guarded supremacy of consciousness, which is, in truth, one of the secrets of

01:06.320 --> 01:11.080
human success, is questioned in the most dangerous way.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.080
End quote.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.920
That's from Carl Jung's essay, Arc Types of the Collective Unconscious, and in that

01:17.920 --> 01:23.600
passage Jung puts forward the central idea of his philosophy of the psyche, his most

01:23.600 --> 01:26.520
important and also his most terrifying.

01:26.520 --> 01:33.360
Here he raises the prospect of mankind as a creature who is not the maker of his own

01:33.360 --> 01:36.840
fate, a creature who is in the hands of the gods.

01:36.840 --> 01:42.200
In modern times we've renamed these divinities, we've made them accord with a mechanistic

01:42.200 --> 01:47.720
scientific understanding of the world, and we've presumed that on this basis we can dispense

01:47.720 --> 01:54.360
with these gods, we can regard the ego-consciousness as its own self-governing autonomous entity.

01:54.360 --> 02:00.840
Carl Jung's project is, in some sense, as simple as the project of restoring our awareness

02:00.840 --> 02:07.380
of these unseen factors, driving our thought and action, and restoring a sense of respect

02:07.380 --> 02:13.280
and awe for them, the project to restore a healthy respect for the gods, which we now

02:13.280 --> 02:16.280
call unconscious factors.

02:16.280 --> 02:21.240
And in doing this Jung seeks to revive the religious or mythic language by which we

02:21.240 --> 02:26.120
used to speak about these things, which he believes still dwell deep within the human

02:26.120 --> 02:33.320
psyche, not as part of our consciousness, not as subjects within the power of the consciousness,

02:33.320 --> 02:37.680
but as the master behind the throne of consciousness.

02:37.680 --> 02:43.200
As straightforward as this may seem, however, such a prospect remains a daunting challenge

02:43.200 --> 02:49.160
for the modern man, because we have not found gods and goddesses in our search of the stars

02:49.160 --> 02:51.320
and of galaxies.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.240
We have not found that the atoms are moved by mystical forces.

02:55.240 --> 03:01.360
We've come to regard past mythologies as so many childish fables, which may serve as

03:01.360 --> 03:06.280
a source of historical fascination, but which elucidates nothing about the objective world,

03:06.280 --> 03:09.160
or the human condition as such.

03:09.160 --> 03:14.880
The various mystical pursuits of man, whether it was the practice of astrology in which we

03:14.880 --> 03:19.800
attempted to discover our future through the interpretation of the movement of celestial

03:19.800 --> 03:26.400
bodies, or the great work of the alchemists, those proto-scientists who believed that the

03:26.400 --> 03:30.920
laws which govern the divine are the same as the laws that govern the material world,

03:30.920 --> 03:35.600
or the many religious stories and prophecies recorded in our holy books that endeavor to

03:35.600 --> 03:40.520
tell us the origin and meaning of life through divine revelation.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.560
The modern mind looks at all of this and sees nothing but a series of outdated and

03:44.560 --> 03:47.080
unscientific assertions.

03:47.080 --> 03:53.560
These were merely culturally and geographically bound folktales in the modern view.

03:53.560 --> 03:58.280
They reveal nothing about the real meaning of human life, that is, if we even permit

03:58.280 --> 04:04.200
that life may have a meaning, which in itself is regarded as a disagreeable presumption.

04:04.200 --> 04:10.960
We might say that we see all of these artifacts of religious thought as childish things coming

04:10.960 --> 04:18.120
from the youth and ignorance of youth of our race, and to put it in the language of the

04:18.120 --> 04:25.280
Bible, the scientific modern mind says it is high past time to put away childish things.

04:25.280 --> 04:33.280
And yet, throughout Jung's work in psychoanalysis, he steadily began to believe that these mythical

04:33.280 --> 04:39.540
figures and stories are far more than the mere playthings of a more childish mankind

04:39.540 --> 04:44.760
that could simply be put to the side upon the scientific maturity of the human race.

04:44.760 --> 04:51.880
The reason for Jung's suspicion is based on the observation that his patients would recreate

04:51.880 --> 04:57.480
the imagery of myth and religion, in their dreams, or in the case of schizophrenics,

04:57.480 --> 04:58.960
in their hallucinations.

04:59.600 --> 05:05.120
Furthermore, when Jung had his patients draw or paint freely as a form of therapeutic exercise,

05:05.120 --> 05:07.280
he found they would do peculiar things.

05:07.280 --> 05:12.600
They would draw mandalas, for example, a type of circular sigil common to the imagery of

05:12.600 --> 05:18.400
Eastern spirituality, but completely unknown Jung tells us among his European patients

05:18.400 --> 05:19.840
at that time.

05:19.840 --> 05:25.120
They would draw upon the same kinds of allegories used by esoteric Christians such as the Russa

05:25.120 --> 05:29.600
Crucian Order, but without having any knowledge that they were doing so.

05:29.600 --> 05:35.360
And Jung began to suspect that there was a language, a lexicon, being employed here,

05:35.360 --> 05:42.440
a language of images and symbols that seemed to derive from a deeper well than the mere

05:42.440 --> 05:47.080
personal experience of his patients or their cultural upbringing, that his patients were

05:47.080 --> 05:52.880
drawing upon something deep within the psyche that was not individual, but universal.

05:52.880 --> 05:58.920
The collective psychic contents of all mankind, which we use when we attempt to discuss the

05:58.920 --> 06:05.040
most significant aspects and events of our lives, the most transformative experiences

06:05.040 --> 06:09.000
of life, draws upon this language.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Given the material that we've already covered this season, one can see the mark of Nietzsche's

06:13.000 --> 06:19.080
thought on Jung's already from this description, as well as the ways in which Jung develops

06:19.080 --> 06:23.120
the thought of his erstwhile friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud.

06:23.120 --> 06:28.400
Unlike Freud, Jung was never interested in hiding his influences or claiming originality

06:28.400 --> 06:30.080
for himself or his ideas.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.680
I mean, in some sense Jung's whole project is oriented around the idea that he is not

06:34.680 --> 06:40.920
an original thinker, that he's simply returning us to the knowledge that we have already held

06:40.920 --> 06:42.600
since time immemorial.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.240
But we've forgotten this with the death of our mythic language, our mythic understanding

06:47.240 --> 06:50.680
or perspective that allowed us to talk about it.

06:50.680 --> 06:56.240
Jung also credits previous thinkers such as Carus and von Hartmann as those who had brought

06:56.240 --> 06:59.240
to light the power of the unconscious.

06:59.240 --> 07:04.880
But where Jung goes beyond all these previous figures is insofar as he presents us with

07:04.880 --> 07:12.760
a comprehensible system for approaching and understanding this vast and confusing realm

07:12.760 --> 07:15.200
of the unconscious contents.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.800
It is through psychology that we can once again approach the mythic and reintegrate these

07:20.800 --> 07:29.080
two seemingly incongruous elements of our rational, moral, and outward persona with

07:29.080 --> 07:37.600
the mysterious, powerful, numinous archetypes which are the secret makers of our destiny.

07:37.600 --> 07:43.840
Karl Gustav Jung was born in 1875 in Switzerland.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.360
Broadly speaking, his life bears some similarities to Nietzsche's.

07:47.360 --> 07:52.080
As a young man, he initially thought of attending seminary and becoming a minister.

07:52.080 --> 07:57.000
And then as a teenager, he began to study philosophy and this changed his plans for

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
life.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.920
He opted to pursue the sciences instead.

08:00.920 --> 08:05.640
While in Nietzsche's case, the path leads the young Friedrich Nietzsche to the discipline

08:05.640 --> 08:09.880
of philology, Karl Jung pursued psychiatry.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.840
He attended the University of Basel where he studied medicine.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.400
By the early 1900s, he was in correspondence with Sigmund Freud.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.360
The two men leave us a considerable volume of letters.

08:21.360 --> 08:26.640
Freud was much older than Jung and over the period of six years during which they collaborated

08:26.640 --> 08:33.280
extensively, Freud famously wanted Jung to become his successor in some sense.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.160
He was trying to push Jung in that direction.

08:37.160 --> 08:43.600
He wanted him to become the lifetime president of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.080
And Freud was overruled in this.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.480
Jung instead served as president for two years instead of a lifetime appointment.

08:50.480 --> 08:57.480
But he referred to Jung as his adoptive son, his sort of crown prince and successor.

08:57.480 --> 09:01.880
As is commonly known, however, there was always a rift between the two men that would only

09:01.880 --> 09:04.080
grow as the years went by.

09:04.080 --> 09:09.600
Jung was dissatisfied with Freud's focus on sexuality as the primary driver of human

09:09.600 --> 09:10.600
psychology.

09:10.600 --> 09:18.160
Furthermore, he respected Freud's work as regards repression and his work on the id as

09:18.160 --> 09:23.280
a repository for all that which the consciousness has attempted to suppress.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.960
But Jung began to suspect that there was something far faster than a mere personal unconsciousness

09:27.960 --> 09:31.040
beneath the surface world of the ego.

09:31.040 --> 09:36.000
With the publication of Jung's lectures on the psychology of the unconscious in 1913,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.600
a book which you can now find under the title of symbols of transformation, the disagreement

09:41.600 --> 09:45.480
between the two men would only increase in its intensity.

09:45.480 --> 09:49.560
And as a matter of fact, Jung said that this book's publication was the thing that ended

09:49.560 --> 09:51.000
their friendship.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.720
As Jung in that text made it clear just how seriously he differed with Freud's account

09:55.720 --> 09:56.720
of the psyche.

09:56.720 --> 10:01.960
Freud, it seems, had only wanted a crown prince and successor so long as they agreed

10:01.960 --> 10:08.240
with him and carried on Freud's own project on Freud's own terms.

10:08.240 --> 10:14.160
Furthermore, Freud is an atheist, and he's enrolled in a completely different kind of

10:14.160 --> 10:19.920
task in the field of psychology than Jung is, whereas Freud's psychoanalysis sought to

10:19.920 --> 10:25.520
explain the human being within a godless world, a world in which man's higher aspirations

10:25.520 --> 10:29.040
could be seen as outgrowths of base urges.

10:29.040 --> 10:33.280
All of man's moral sentiments could be born on the power of the libido.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.560
Jung's tendency is almost the exact opposite.

10:36.560 --> 10:42.240
In the depths of the unconsciousness, Jung does not see mere animal impulses or something

10:42.240 --> 10:45.860
reducible to the basis drives of man.

10:45.860 --> 10:52.040
He sees a well where we can reach down deep in it into truths so profound and inexpressible

10:52.040 --> 10:57.800
by the consciousness that they can only be understood in religious terms.

10:57.800 --> 11:03.520
Whereas Freud found in psychology the refutation of religious thinking as a curative to the

11:03.520 --> 11:09.760
pathological complexes of the modern man, Jung found the affirmation of the value of

11:09.760 --> 11:14.400
such thinking to be the very cure that the modern man was seeking.

11:14.400 --> 11:20.360
The break with Freud had professional consequences for Jung, while Freud has been left behind

11:20.480 --> 11:22.720
in the psychology of our time.

11:22.720 --> 11:28.920
In the early decades of the 20th century Freud was the preeminent figure of the psychoanalysts.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.560
He was essentially its founder and its greatest celebrity.

11:32.560 --> 11:37.280
Jung more or less has a midlife crisis at this point.

11:37.280 --> 11:42.960
He had what can only be described as an extended psychological episode that we could characterize

11:42.960 --> 11:47.240
as either hysteria or depression or perhaps both.

11:47.240 --> 11:52.960
At many times he was borderline suicidal, and during this time in which Jung spent

11:52.960 --> 11:59.680
extended periods in solitude, he authored his Red Book, a series of diaries with fantastical

11:59.680 --> 12:05.600
religious imagery which Jung saw as his way of working through what he perceived as a

12:05.600 --> 12:13.080
dark night of the soul, which is a perennial theme in one's path of mystical or spiritual

12:13.080 --> 12:15.520
transformation.

12:15.560 --> 12:20.240
Jung however made it through this trying period, and he began publishing his work again in

12:20.240 --> 12:22.400
various academic journals.

12:22.400 --> 12:27.480
He served as an army doctor during World War I. In the interwar years he embarked on some

12:27.480 --> 12:34.520
of his most famous and influential projects, including his book Psychological Types.

12:34.520 --> 12:39.080
And during World War II a fun tidbit about his life that was not known until recently,

12:39.080 --> 12:43.840
because if I recall correctly it was classified, but Jung wrote reports that he sent to the

12:43.840 --> 12:49.160
U.S.S. the American Intelligence Branch that would later become the CIA, advising the Americans

12:49.160 --> 12:51.720
on Hitler's mental state.

12:51.720 --> 12:58.360
He traveled the world visiting America, Britain, Africa, India, equating himself with the mythic

12:58.360 --> 13:01.440
underpinnings of the various world religions.

13:01.440 --> 13:06.680
He was productive until his final year, until he passed away at the age of 85 in the year

13:06.680 --> 13:09.680
1961.

13:09.680 --> 13:14.120
The origins of Jung's theory of archetype states all the way back to his first major

13:14.120 --> 13:20.120
publication on the psychology and pathology of so-called occult phenomena published in

13:20.120 --> 13:21.920
1902.

13:21.920 --> 13:26.200
This was the work that had drawn Freud's attention at the time.

13:26.200 --> 13:31.760
In this work Jung described the hallucinatory fantasies of a hysterical spiritual medium

13:31.760 --> 13:36.200
whose seances Jung attended in the late 1890s.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.640
Should be noted, there was something of a craze surrounding seances and mediums during

13:40.640 --> 13:44.240
the late 1800s and the first decades of the 1900s.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.560
So this wasn't a terribly unusual social outing.

13:49.560 --> 13:55.480
Jung notes how the patient, the spirit medium, would have these somnambulic attacks.

13:55.480 --> 14:00.840
She would lose control of her motor function, be confronted by visions of spirits.

14:01.280 --> 14:06.720
However, the patient's ego, her sense of her individual conscious persona, was present

14:06.720 --> 14:09.600
and intact during these incidents.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.040
That is, she did not display multiple personalities herself.

14:13.040 --> 14:20.080
She seemed to remain the conscious subject, merely encountering these avatars of her unconscious

14:20.080 --> 14:21.080
mind.

14:21.080 --> 14:27.120
You see the first intimation of archetypes in this work, and that Jung comes to understand

14:27.120 --> 14:33.240
that even though the spirits that the patient encounters are numerous, they could be grouped,

14:33.240 --> 14:36.360
so to speak, into two definite types.

14:36.360 --> 14:40.440
That in some sense all the different iterations of these spirit personalities were in fact

14:40.440 --> 14:47.680
reiterations of the same two unconscious sub-personalities or complexes.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.200
Jung writes in this article, quote,

14:50.840 --> 14:55.800
It seems that many secondary series of ideas must have split off quite early from the primary

14:55.800 --> 14:57.960
unconscious personality.

14:57.960 --> 15:02.880
For already after the first two seances, spirits appeared by the dozen.

15:02.880 --> 15:07.560
The names were inexhaustible in variety, but the differences between the personalities

15:07.560 --> 15:11.960
were soon exhausted and it became apparent that they could all be subsumed under two

15:11.960 --> 15:17.240
types, the serial religious type and the gay hilarious.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.240
So far it was really only a matter of two different unconscious personalities, which

15:21.240 --> 15:26.120
appeared under different names, but had no essential differences, end quote.

15:26.120 --> 15:30.640
This insight is the germ of much of Jung's later thought.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.880
It's a theme he would see play out time and again with multiple patients.

15:34.880 --> 15:41.000
The same cast of characters, more or less, innumerable in terms of the exact name or

15:41.000 --> 15:46.600
the image attributed to the character by the patient, but nevertheless the same in essence

15:46.680 --> 15:51.040
as other iterations of the same character type.

15:51.040 --> 15:56.560
Jung's research in the various world religions was spurred on by this same underlying idea.

15:56.560 --> 16:03.600
He began to perceive that types appear in the myth-making of the various world cultures.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.600
Jung writes, quote,

16:04.840 --> 16:10.200
Permit of man impresses us so strongly with his subjectivity that we should really have

16:10.200 --> 16:15.800
guessed long ago that myths refer to something psychic, end quote.

16:15.800 --> 16:21.160
But unlike Freud, Jung did not seek to make our myths small and insignificant on that

16:21.160 --> 16:22.160
basis.

16:22.160 --> 16:28.520
Instead, he grows to see the depths of human psychology as being just as profound as our

16:28.520 --> 16:34.120
oldest stories, and in fact it's the well from which these stories are drawn.

16:34.120 --> 16:38.480
Now, as our main focus for this episode, we're going to turn to Volume 9 of Jung's

16:38.480 --> 16:44.040
collected works, which includes his essays written from the time of 1933 onward on the

16:44.040 --> 16:48.000
subject of the archetypes and the collective unconscious.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.720
From the very beginning of that volume, in the first essay included there entitled archetypes

16:52.720 --> 16:57.560
of the collective unconscious, Jung makes clear the operative difference between his

16:57.560 --> 17:02.320
own thought and that of Freud, quote.

17:02.320 --> 17:07.400
At first, the concept of the unconscious was limited to denoting the state of repressed

17:07.400 --> 17:09.440
or forgotten contents.

17:09.440 --> 17:14.120
Even with Freud, who makes the unconscious, at least metaphorically, take the stage as

17:14.120 --> 17:18.960
acting subject, it is really nothing but the gathering place of forgotten and repressed

17:18.960 --> 17:23.720
contents, and has a functional significance thanks only to these.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.480
For Freud, accordingly, the unconscious is of an exclusively personal nature, although

17:28.480 --> 17:32.520
he was aware of its archaic and mythological thought forms.

17:32.520 --> 17:37.320
A more or less superficial layer of the unconscious is undoubtedly personal.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.760
I call it the personal unconscious.

17:39.760 --> 17:45.160
But this personal unconscious rests upon a deeper layer, which does not derive from personal

17:45.160 --> 17:50.600
experience and is not a personal acquisition, but is inborn.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.760
This deeper layer I call the collective unconscious.

17:53.760 --> 17:58.520
I have chosen the name collective because this part of the unconscious is not individual

17:58.520 --> 18:00.080
but universal.

18:00.080 --> 18:05.000
In contrast to the personal psyche, it has contents and modes of behavior that are more

18:05.000 --> 18:09.240
or less the same everywhere and in all individuals.

18:09.240 --> 18:14.560
It is, in other words, identical in all men and thus constitutes the common psychic substrate

18:14.560 --> 18:20.760
of a super personal nature which is present in every one of us, end quote.

18:20.760 --> 18:27.240
The collective unconscious is often wrongly characterized as a sort of supernatural claim

18:27.240 --> 18:32.720
about humanity, as if we have some sort of psychic link between our minds or sort of

18:32.720 --> 18:36.160
hive mind unconsciousness, something of the like.

18:36.160 --> 18:43.000
The actual claim is simply that, in the same way that we're all born with certain instincts,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.520
we're also all born with certain unconscious knowledge, that we have a pre-rational lexicon

18:48.520 --> 18:52.560
of imagery or symbolism that exists in all human minds.

18:52.560 --> 18:59.400
It's a starting, basic kit of information that's contained in the unconscious prior

18:59.400 --> 19:02.680
to any enculturation or upbringing.

19:02.680 --> 19:07.280
It's really no stronger of a claim than any claim about inborn traits or knowledge that

19:07.280 --> 19:11.680
exists in every human being, which I think would be fairly hard to argue against.

19:11.680 --> 19:17.400
To say that there is no universal, relatable palette of human emotions or impulses would

19:17.400 --> 19:19.600
simply be patently false.

19:19.600 --> 19:24.560
All human beings experience anger, experience sexual urges, experience hunger and thirst,

19:24.560 --> 19:29.520
all human beings have a fight or flight mechanism, we can easily accept such ideas.

19:29.520 --> 19:34.760
The troubling assertion that Jung makes, really, is that human nature also contains unconscious

19:34.760 --> 19:39.120
information, not just unconscious instinct.

19:39.120 --> 19:43.400
This is not to be considered knowledge or information of a kind that would necessarily

19:43.400 --> 19:49.760
be parsed by a rational discursive intellect, wherever it makes itself known, it appears

19:49.760 --> 19:58.640
not in the form of word concepts or abstract ideas, but in the form of these figures, images

19:58.640 --> 20:01.080
or narratives.

20:01.080 --> 20:07.080
We can see how Jung's work draws upon Freud, or serves as an elaboration upon it, and that

20:07.080 --> 20:13.760
Jung also believes that the repressed personal unconsciousness is what lies beneath the surface

20:13.760 --> 20:15.800
of the ego.

20:15.800 --> 20:22.280
But Jung thinks that this repressed, unacceptable psychic content is itself only another surface

20:22.280 --> 20:26.680
layer sitting upon this wide world of the id.

20:26.680 --> 20:33.640
Jung describes in this essay a number of profound religious dreams, in which this vaster unconsciousness

20:33.720 --> 20:37.960
is likened to a sea or a dark lake.

20:37.960 --> 20:43.000
The association of the unconsciousness with water is a common symbol found in such dreams

20:43.000 --> 20:45.640
and experiences.

20:45.640 --> 20:51.760
Jung describes one dreamer who often saw the castle of the Grail sitting on a high mountaintop,

20:51.760 --> 20:57.960
but found that he could only reach it by passing, quote, a darksome gorge with underworldly

20:57.960 --> 21:01.680
water rushing along the bottom, end quote.

21:01.720 --> 21:06.280
Another patient, a Protestant theologian, had a recurring dream in which he was standing

21:06.280 --> 21:11.200
on a high mountain slope, looking down into the deep valley below, in which there was

21:11.200 --> 21:13.040
a dark lake.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.800
In the dream, he felt that something always held him back from going down to the lake,

21:17.800 --> 21:20.480
but he decided to venture there anyway.

21:20.480 --> 21:26.440
As he approached the water, quote, everything grew dark and uncanny, and a gust of wind suddenly

21:26.440 --> 21:29.000
rushed over the face of the water.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.200
He was seized by a panic fear and awoke, end quote.

21:35.200 --> 21:39.960
Water is only one of the common symbols for a confrontation with the unconsciousness,

21:39.960 --> 21:44.280
and a theme we can already see developing in these two example dreams is that in order

21:44.280 --> 21:50.920
to reach a place perceived as above the psyche, the ideal, the spiritual, however we may interpret

21:50.920 --> 21:54.680
it, one must first journey downward.

21:54.680 --> 22:00.360
The imagery of water, of a lake or sea seems natural for the human mind, it indicates something

22:00.360 --> 22:06.800
of which we can only see the surface, but beneath which there is an unfathomable depth.

22:06.800 --> 22:12.280
To approach the unconsciousness is always a somewhat fearful experience because the first

22:12.280 --> 22:18.080
layer of it contains those very repressed contents, of the contents that were repressed

22:18.080 --> 22:23.880
by the consciousness that characterized the Freudian version of the id, far from being

22:23.880 --> 22:30.600
strictly sexual, this unconscious layer represents everything about our public outward facing

22:30.600 --> 22:36.600
persona that we cannot show the world or manifest in our conscious life and thought.

22:36.600 --> 22:43.480
It is just as much our self as our waking self, but it's the dark reflection of that

22:43.480 --> 22:45.480
waking self.

22:45.480 --> 22:51.160
Jung writes, quote, whoever looks into the mirror of the water will see first of all

22:51.160 --> 22:58.880
his own face, whoever goes to himself risks a confrontation with himself, the mirror does

22:58.880 --> 23:04.440
not flatter, it faithfully shows whatever looks into it, namely the face we never show

23:04.440 --> 23:10.920
to the world because we cover it with the persona, the mask of an actor, but the mirror

23:10.920 --> 23:15.760
lies behind the mask and shows the true face, end quote.

23:15.760 --> 23:21.080
This is what Jung calls the shadow, it is the sum total of everything about ourselves

23:21.080 --> 23:25.640
which we have judged as negative, but it would be a mistake to think that the shadow does

23:25.640 --> 23:30.880
not operate in the world through our conscious personality, it does not remain confined to

23:30.880 --> 23:33.720
our unconscious thoughts or dreams.

23:33.720 --> 23:39.200
On the contrary, Jung says that quote, the shadow is a living part of the personality

23:39.200 --> 23:44.160
and therefore wants to live with it in some form, it cannot be argued out of existence

23:44.160 --> 23:48.040
or rationalized into harmlessness, end quote.

23:48.040 --> 23:53.800
The way that Jung describes the shadow as a phenomenon, a psychic phenomenon is exceedingly

23:53.800 --> 23:59.360
fascinating because the shadow is both a terrible figure, but it is also the herald of a great

23:59.360 --> 24:01.840
personal transformation.

24:01.840 --> 24:07.000
Just as one must find their way across the terrible rushing waters of a dark gorge in

24:07.000 --> 24:11.760
order to find their way to the holy grail, the shadow is the gateway to a deeper understanding

24:11.760 --> 24:13.680
of oneself.

24:13.680 --> 24:20.240
Jung writes in paragraph 45 of that same essay quote, the meeting with oneself is, at first,

24:20.240 --> 24:22.240
the meeting with one's own shadow.

24:22.240 --> 24:27.440
The shadow is a tight passage, a narrow door whose painful constriction no one has spared

24:27.440 --> 24:30.840
who goes down to the deep well, end quote.

24:30.840 --> 24:36.320
In order to understand how the shadow makes itself felt in our daily lives, it is essential

24:36.320 --> 24:40.720
that we understand Jung's concept of projection.

24:40.720 --> 24:46.400
Consciousness naturally raises certain aspects of the self into a state of conscious sovereignty,

24:46.400 --> 24:51.760
and so long as the conscious persona is healthy, functioning, flourishing, those unconscious

24:51.760 --> 24:57.720
contents which are unacceptable for the social life are deprived of energy, so to speak,

24:57.720 --> 24:59.840
they're kept subordinated.

24:59.840 --> 25:04.480
But if the conscious domain of the psyche becomes unbalanced, unhealthy in some way,

25:04.480 --> 25:10.040
is challenged or disturbed in some serious way, those unconscious complexes will start

25:10.040 --> 25:15.360
to take charge of it, and furthermore the unconscious contents are experienced as something

25:15.360 --> 25:18.120
foreign to the conscious self.

25:18.120 --> 25:25.560
Jung writes quote, the collective unconscious is anything but an encapsulated personal system.

25:25.560 --> 25:31.280
It is sheer objectivity, as wide as the world and open to all the world.

25:31.280 --> 25:36.160
There I am the object of every subject, in complete reversal of my ordinary consciousness

25:36.160 --> 25:41.520
where I am always the subject that has an object, end quote.

25:41.520 --> 25:47.760
And so, when someone's unacceptable unconscious content that Jung calls their shadow begins

25:47.760 --> 25:52.720
to make itself forceful over the conscious personality, it is natural that we should

25:52.720 --> 25:57.720
experience this as something external, that we should therefore project that feeling,

25:57.720 --> 26:02.200
that complex, that type, onto the external world.

26:02.200 --> 26:06.680
Jung clarifies in one section that this term projection should not be taken to mean that

26:06.680 --> 26:11.520
the psyche has actually reached out into the objective world and exercised a power over

26:11.520 --> 26:13.000
the external.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.960
He says another term one could use for projection would be introjection, the use of external

26:17.960 --> 26:24.280
objects or entities to symbolize some process which is actually internal to the subject,

26:24.280 --> 26:28.640
that really we're not so much pitching the psyche out with projection so much as we are

26:28.640 --> 26:31.040
bringing the external in.

26:31.040 --> 26:36.640
So for an example of the shadow crashing into the psyche of an otherwise healthy mind,

26:36.640 --> 26:41.720
suppose we have an individual who feels that aggressiveness and competition, whether it

26:41.720 --> 26:47.040
be sports or one's career or simply social life in general, that it's inappropriate

26:47.040 --> 26:53.320
and it's mean spirited, that one should not ever express hostility towards one's fellow

26:53.320 --> 26:58.960
competitors, you should comport yourself with a kind of mutual respect.

26:58.960 --> 27:03.720
You would probably all say these are admirable values for one to hold, but perhaps we can

27:03.720 --> 27:09.160
imagine someone who feels this value of a desire for mutual respect and competition

27:09.160 --> 27:15.240
so strongly that he always suspects that his competitors are hostile toward him.

27:15.240 --> 27:19.600
When he loses on the football field, he assumes his opponents must be putting his team down

27:19.600 --> 27:22.320
in their own locker room after the game.

27:22.320 --> 27:27.160
When a coworker passes him and gets the promotion, he assumes that this person secretly hates

27:27.280 --> 27:29.280
him or looks down upon him.

27:29.280 --> 27:34.400
And accordingly, because all of our sportsmanship is just a false veneer in the first place,

27:34.400 --> 27:39.200
perhaps he ends up feeling that hostility towards all of his competitors around him.

27:39.200 --> 27:43.240
This fills him with a sense of guilt, but he reminds himself that it's really the fault

27:43.240 --> 27:47.160
of all of those around him who have disrespected him over the years.

27:47.160 --> 27:51.480
A Jungian might look at such a person and see that he's become possessed by his shadow

27:51.480 --> 27:53.400
to some extent.

27:53.400 --> 27:57.960
And in this process, he is experienced as something foreign, something alien to his

27:57.960 --> 27:59.640
ego consciousness.

27:59.640 --> 28:04.880
With all of his moral pretensions, that mutual respect is the basis of all friendly competition,

28:04.880 --> 28:09.960
but he always projects his own shadow onto the behaviors of his friends and his coworkers.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.880
The fact that it is really he who feels this deep hostility and disrespect towards others

28:14.880 --> 28:19.800
is masked by this projection and it becomes a way for him to deal with the guilt that

28:19.800 --> 28:22.800
he feels for feeling that way.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.880
All of this would be in the patient's shadow self.

28:26.880 --> 28:30.960
Jung gives an explanation in broad, somewhat poetic terms of what the person possessed

28:30.960 --> 28:36.280
by the shadow or by their quote, inferior functions is like.

28:36.280 --> 28:42.920
This is in concerning rebirth paragraph 222 of archetypes and the collective unconscious

28:42.920 --> 28:44.720
quote.

28:44.720 --> 28:50.680
The inferior function is practically identical with the dark side of the human personality,

28:50.680 --> 28:55.280
the darkness which clings to every personality is the door into the unconscious and the gateway

28:55.280 --> 29:01.160
of our dreams, from which those two twilight figures, the shadow and the anima, step into

29:01.160 --> 29:07.440
our nightly visions, or remaining invisible take possession of our ego consciousness.

29:07.440 --> 29:12.240
A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into

29:12.240 --> 29:14.320
his own traps.

29:14.320 --> 29:18.960
Whenever possible, he prefers to make an unfavorable impression on others.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.840
In the long run, luck is always against him because he is living below his own level,

29:23.840 --> 29:28.080
and at best only attains what does not suit him.

29:28.080 --> 29:33.240
And if there is no doorstep for him to stumble over, he manufactures one for himself and then

29:33.240 --> 29:38.600
fondly believes he has done something useful.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.280
Jung mentions the anima there, which we will address in a little bit, but the main thing

29:42.280 --> 29:48.240
to remember about the shadow, it's the unacceptable side of ourselves, which nevertheless exists

29:48.440 --> 29:52.920
and sometimes motivates our actions and that we therefore project onto the external in order

29:52.920 --> 29:56.280
to deal with the cognitive dissonance that that brings.

29:56.280 --> 30:00.520
We would sooner see the contents of our own shadow in our friends, in our neighbors, in

30:00.520 --> 30:06.040
our interlocutors than in ourselves, and such a person who is possessed by their shadow

30:06.040 --> 30:11.800
will consequently bring forth the very aspect of himself that he despises and then experience

30:11.800 --> 30:13.800
it as something alien.

30:13.800 --> 30:18.920
We will get in our own way and then perceive that obstacle as the other.

30:18.920 --> 30:24.040
In dreams, the shadow can appear as numerous images, sometimes as a hostile animal or a

30:24.040 --> 30:28.120
predator, sometimes as a primitive human being.

30:28.120 --> 30:33.520
The shadow appears throughout the mythology of mankind as an adversary or as a dark inversion

30:33.520 --> 30:35.640
of the heroic figure.

30:35.640 --> 30:40.720
Because the origin of these unacceptable drives or impulses is within our animal nature, the

30:40.720 --> 30:47.320
association of the shadow with less conscious animals or more instinctive forms of life

30:47.320 --> 30:50.000
seems somewhat obvious.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.840
But in many cultures, Jung argues, the shadow appears in the mythology as a trickster figure.

30:56.840 --> 31:01.920
Such a figure is something of a riddle because the trickster entities of many religions and

31:01.920 --> 31:07.800
superstitious traditions is a sort of mixed and paradoxical character.

31:07.800 --> 31:11.720
Jung says that there is something of the trickster in the image of the shaman and the medicine

31:11.720 --> 31:17.320
man, the wild figure who lives at the boundaries of society but has a connection with the world

31:17.320 --> 31:18.960
of spirits.

31:18.960 --> 31:24.720
The poltergeist is another such example within popular folklore, in this case of a trickster

31:24.720 --> 31:26.200
spirit.

31:26.200 --> 31:31.280
Jung also brings up the contradictoryness of the trickster in European folklore in the

31:31.280 --> 31:37.200
form of the devil, regarded as the ape of God, who is sometimes portrayed in the legends

31:37.200 --> 31:43.440
as a simpleton who is easily fooled or cheated by ordinary human beings.

31:43.440 --> 31:48.560
There are also the figures out of folktales such as Tom Thumb or Stupid Hans and one

31:48.560 --> 31:54.440
of Grimm's fairy tales, the spirit Mercurius, who takes his name from the Greek god Mercury,

31:54.440 --> 31:57.800
is outwitted by a simple peasant.

31:57.800 --> 32:03.240
Jung argues in his essay Psychology of the Trickster Figure that quote, if the myth were

32:03.240 --> 32:08.680
nothing but an historical remnant, one would have to ask why it has not long since vanished

32:08.680 --> 32:13.320
into the great rubbish heap of the past.

32:13.320 --> 32:19.160
Instead, the trickster still fascinates us, whether it's Mephisto and Goethe's Faust,

32:19.160 --> 32:25.760
Loki and the Norse myths, or for that matter, Loki in the latest Marvel production, or in

32:25.760 --> 32:31.760
the horror stories of poltergeists and other such mischievous spirits.

32:31.800 --> 32:37.000
Jung references the strange European tradition of celebrating the trickster.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.560
Jung believes that these fests and carnivals were in some sense rooted in the Roman holiday

32:41.560 --> 32:47.960
of Saturnalia, in which societal roles were reversed, slaves ordered around their masters,

32:47.960 --> 32:48.960
and so on.

32:48.960 --> 32:54.760
In medieval Europe, the New Year was celebrated with singing and dancing, called the Fool's

32:54.760 --> 32:55.760
Feast.

32:55.760 --> 33:02.520
In the year 1198, apparently the festivities got so out of hand that Pope Innocent III

33:02.520 --> 33:09.360
railed against the, quote, gests and madness that make the clergy a mockery, end quote,

33:09.360 --> 33:13.840
and the, quote, shameless frenzy of their play acting, end quote.

33:13.840 --> 33:19.280
And even 200 years later, a letter to the theological faculty of Paris complained that

33:19.280 --> 33:25.520
even the clergy was getting involved with these Fool's Feasts and that they were farcically

33:25.520 --> 33:29.520
electing a Fool's Pope during these festivities.

33:29.520 --> 33:35.000
There was also the Festum Assenorum, the Ass Festival, or Donkey Festival.

33:35.000 --> 33:39.520
As Jung mentions, this is referenced by Nietzsche himself and thus spoke Zarathustra, the chapter

33:39.520 --> 33:46.520
named the Ass Festival, and in Jung's estimation that chapter of Zarathustra is, quote, a deliberately

33:46.520 --> 33:50.840
blasphemous parody of the mass, end quote.

33:50.840 --> 33:56.240
As Jung explains, we cannot source this apparently farcical celebration to Nietzsche himself.

33:56.240 --> 34:02.080
These strange ecclesiastical customs are the organic products of the Middle Ages.

34:02.080 --> 34:07.920
A procession of men marched with a donkey, decked with a golden canopy, and they marched

34:07.920 --> 34:12.600
all the way into the church, and there the priest would conclude mass by braying three

34:12.600 --> 34:18.600
times, like a donkey, and the priests and archbishops then played a ballgame inside

34:18.600 --> 34:20.600
the church.

34:20.600 --> 34:25.860
Jung writes, quote, in picker-esque tales and carnivals and revels, and magic rites of

34:25.860 --> 34:31.320
healing and man's religious fears and exaltations, the phantom of the trickster haunts the mythology

34:31.320 --> 34:38.560
of all ages, sometimes in quite unmistakable form, sometimes in strangely modified guise,

34:38.560 --> 34:44.120
end quote, and a bit further in the essay Jung continues, quote, the trickster motif

34:44.120 --> 34:49.760
does not crop up only in its mythical form, but appears just as naively and authentically

34:49.760 --> 34:52.400
in the unsuspecting modern man.

34:52.400 --> 34:58.120
Whenever in fact he feels himself at the mercy of annoying, quote, accidents, which thwart

34:58.120 --> 35:04.400
his will and his actions with apparently malicious intent, he then speaks of, quote, hoodos

35:04.400 --> 35:09.200
and jinxes, or of the mischievousness of the object.

35:09.200 --> 35:14.320
Here the trickster is represented by counter tendencies in the unconscious, and in certain

35:14.320 --> 35:20.640
cases by a sort of second personality of a purile and inferior character, not unlike

35:20.640 --> 35:26.120
the personalities who announce themselves at spiritualistic sciences, and cause all those

35:26.120 --> 35:30.520
ineffably childish phenomena so typical of poltergeists.

35:30.520 --> 35:34.720
I have, I think, found a suitable designation for this character component when I called

35:34.720 --> 35:36.640
it the shadow.

35:36.640 --> 35:42.720
On the civilized level, it is regarded as a personal gaffe, slip, faux pas, etc., which

35:42.720 --> 35:46.960
are then chalked up as defects of the conscious personality.

35:46.960 --> 35:51.920
We are no longer aware that in carnival customs and the like, there are remnants of a collective

35:51.920 --> 35:57.000
shadow figure which proved that the personal shadow is in part descended from a numinous

35:57.000 --> 36:00.200
collective figure, end quote.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.760
Just a few observations about that.

36:02.760 --> 36:10.120
To this very day, people reference the legend of gremlins, which was very popular apparently

36:10.120 --> 36:13.920
during Air Force pilots during World War II.

36:13.920 --> 36:18.040
If they have random problems with a part or something of that nature, they'd say, oh,

36:18.040 --> 36:24.120
the gremlins, these little malicious elves who get into the machinery and mess it up.

36:24.200 --> 36:29.760
I still will say that phrase myself, and I know people will use it of like, oh, damn

36:29.760 --> 36:32.040
gremlins, right?

36:32.040 --> 36:37.840
When it's just apparently a random accident, we'll attribute it to a mischievous little

36:37.840 --> 36:44.240
elf or a mischievous little fiend, or as Jung says, something of a purile and inferior

36:44.240 --> 36:46.640
character.

36:46.640 --> 36:53.880
And furthermore, Jung brings up toward the end there of gaffes, slips, a faux pas.

36:53.880 --> 37:01.000
What is the Freudian slip, finding its way into Jung's psychology to some extent, that

37:01.000 --> 37:06.880
the slips, the gaffes, the mistakes we make when we say the reverse of what we mean to

37:06.880 --> 37:14.400
say, or an unwanted, inappropriate word finds its way into our speech, that what's happening

37:14.400 --> 37:21.560
there is a slippage of the unacceptable contents of consciousness, or of unconsciousness that

37:21.560 --> 37:26.920
the consciousness has suppressed, i.e. the shadow, that's what the Freudian slip is.

37:26.920 --> 37:34.040
Now, the trickster as a figure, when it's treated as a collective figure in the mythology,

37:34.040 --> 37:39.640
it's paradoxical because as Jung points out, in some respects, he's stupider than the animals.

37:39.640 --> 37:44.720
He gets himself into trouble again and again in the fairy tales, and is seemingly helpless

37:44.720 --> 37:46.400
in this.

37:46.400 --> 37:50.800
Even though the shadow as trickster figure is not necessarily evil, quote, he does the

37:50.800 --> 37:56.520
most atrocious things from sheer unconsciousness and unrelatedness, end quote.

37:56.520 --> 38:02.200
And yet, the trickster, such as when he appears in the form of Mercurius, is he from whom

38:02.200 --> 38:05.840
mortal man could win the magic power of healing.

38:05.840 --> 38:11.640
The trickster in Jung's view is a prefiguration of the savior figure, because he leads man

38:11.640 --> 38:17.160
on his way from a placid state of ignorance about his animal nature.

38:17.160 --> 38:23.680
He gives us the red pill to use modern language about our animal nature, rather than, we might

38:23.680 --> 38:27.760
say, the naive notion of the supremacy of consciousness.

38:27.760 --> 38:33.720
Jung writes, quote, the trickster is a primitive cosmic being of a divine animal nature, on

38:33.720 --> 38:38.280
the one hand superior to man because of his superhuman qualities, and on the other hand

38:38.280 --> 38:44.160
inferior to him because of his unreason and his unconsciousness, end quote.

38:44.160 --> 38:49.360
Also to recapitulate, Jung asserts that the first thing we have to confront as we begin

38:49.360 --> 38:56.440
to integrate what is unconscious in the psyche into the conscious mind is those unacceptable

38:56.440 --> 38:58.880
animal impulses within us.

38:58.880 --> 39:04.160
And in fact, we find that much of our behavior is driven by these impulses, as Freud argued.

39:04.160 --> 39:08.720
In fact, you could say all of our impulses have this animal origin.

39:08.720 --> 39:12.800
But because we've gone through the process of civilization, we've become afflicted with

39:12.800 --> 39:17.160
this kind of amnesia, where certain aspects have been suppressed, and the shadow is a

39:17.160 --> 39:21.880
terrifying reminder that they're still there, even though they've been subordinated, and

39:21.880 --> 39:24.040
they're right beneath the surface.

39:24.040 --> 39:30.960
And therefore, we portray that figure as a paradoxical half god, half animal, something

39:30.960 --> 39:37.760
that both lies beneath our humanity and beckons us to what might be above our humanity as

39:37.760 --> 39:39.360
it is now.

39:39.360 --> 39:43.920
Because the confrontation with the shadow is that first encounter with the unconscious,

39:43.920 --> 39:48.760
which is the beginning of the psychic work needed in order to fully integrate and understand

39:48.760 --> 39:49.760
oneself.

39:49.760 --> 39:53.440
Still, the shadow is an incredibly dangerous thing.

39:53.440 --> 39:59.360
It may be precisely because we have ceased to pay the collective shadow its due, that

39:59.360 --> 40:04.360
the shadow might even pose more danger now than ever.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.060
This is a recurring theme with Jung.

40:07.060 --> 40:13.100
That which we do not bring into consciousness, or that which tries to breach into consciousness

40:13.100 --> 40:19.780
and that we continually attempt to ignore, that is always what poses the most frightful

40:19.780 --> 40:24.540
danger, whatever it is that remains in the dark.

40:24.540 --> 40:29.640
Jung writes, quote, the so-called civilized man has forgotten the trickster.

40:29.640 --> 40:34.880
He remembers him only figuratively and metaphorically when irritated by his own ineptitude.

40:34.880 --> 40:39.580
He speaks of fate playing tricks on him or of things being bewitched.

40:39.580 --> 40:44.740
He never suspects that his own hidden and apparently harmless shadow has qualities whose dangerousness

40:44.740 --> 40:47.780
exceeds his wildest dreams.

40:47.780 --> 40:54.000
As soon as people get together in masses and submerge the individual, the shadow is mobilized,

40:54.000 --> 41:01.940
and as history shows, may even be personified and incarnated, end quote.

41:01.940 --> 41:07.360
This is part of how Jung understands the psychology of crowds, what we might call mass psychology,

41:07.360 --> 41:13.360
and it entails a real consequence if we fail to understand the archetypal contents of the

41:13.360 --> 41:14.360
psyche.

41:14.360 --> 41:20.080
Because when lots of individuals aggregate together, what happens is not an ever more

41:20.080 --> 41:26.440
multifarious expression of their individuality, but a race to the most universal thought patterns

41:26.440 --> 41:28.320
and complexes.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.880
That's what overwhelms the individuality of each member.

41:32.540 --> 41:37.940
As all of this unconscious content is collective, those archetypes of the collective unconsciousness

41:37.940 --> 41:43.460
will begin to more strongly express themselves the more powerful the collective is, the more

41:43.460 --> 41:49.220
overwhelming it is, the more the ego consciousness is submerged within the multitude.

41:49.220 --> 41:54.180
Jung believed this was a large part of the psychology of the dangerous collectivist movements

41:54.180 --> 41:56.980
in Europe at that time.

41:56.980 --> 42:01.840
Just as a man who is not integrated as shadow might project that individual shadow onto

42:01.840 --> 42:11.000
his neighbor, so too might an entire society construct a collective shadow, quote, in consequence

42:11.000 --> 42:16.680
of the increasing repression and neglect of the original mythologians as a corresponding

42:16.680 --> 42:22.280
projection on other social groups and nations, end quote.

42:23.280 --> 42:27.880
Now, as the shadow is only a gateway into this world of the unconscious, we might wonder

42:27.880 --> 42:30.440
about some of these other archetypes.

42:30.440 --> 42:33.580
We've already mentioned one of them, the anima.

42:33.580 --> 42:39.820
Jung argues that the anima, like all of these other figures, is not sheer mythology, which

42:39.820 --> 42:44.420
he names as a constant prejudice of so-called scientifically-minded men whenever they encounter

42:44.420 --> 42:45.620
his theories.

42:45.620 --> 42:50.620
He argues that, quote, the concept of the anima is a purely empirical concept, whose

42:50.620 --> 42:55.600
sole purpose is to give a name to a group of related or analogous psychic phenomena.

42:55.600 --> 43:00.400
The concept does no more and means no more than, shall we say, the concept anthropods,

43:00.400 --> 43:05.320
which includes all animals with articulated body and limbs, and so gives a name to this

43:05.320 --> 43:09.160
phenomenological group, end quote.

43:09.160 --> 43:13.120
This passage is useful, not just for understanding how Jung thinks about the anima, but how he

43:13.120 --> 43:17.920
thinks about all of these archetypes, even though he constantly brings in the content

43:18.060 --> 43:22.060
of myths and of dreams and of fantasies.

43:22.060 --> 43:27.860
The point is to notice similarities across all of these and across individuals and cultures,

43:27.860 --> 43:33.220
to classify these so-called dreams and fantasies as definite types, and therefore to have a

43:33.220 --> 43:37.660
basis for inquiring empirically about these types.

43:37.660 --> 43:43.380
Jung explains the anima in the essay, Arc Types of the Collective Unconscious, in this

43:43.440 --> 43:49.940
passage, quote, whoever looks into the water sees his own image, but behind it living creatures

43:49.940 --> 43:52.160
soon loom up.

43:52.160 --> 43:58.400
Fish is presumably harmless dwellers of the deep, harmless if only the lake were not haunted.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.880
They are water beings of a peculiar sort.

44:01.880 --> 44:07.000
Sometimes a nixie gets into the fisherman's net, a female half-human fish.

44:07.020 --> 44:09.620
These are entrancing creatures.

44:09.620 --> 44:15.020
Half drew she him, half sank he down, and never more was seen.

44:15.020 --> 44:20.780
The nixie is an even more instinctive version of a magical feminine being whom I call the

44:20.780 --> 44:21.940
anima.

44:21.940 --> 44:28.940
She can also be a siren, a mermaid, wood nymph, grace, or irkling's daughter, or alamia

44:28.940 --> 44:35.740
or succubus, who infatuates young men and sucks the life out of them, end quote.

44:35.760 --> 44:41.160
So all of these mythical figures, the nixie, the siren, the succubus, these beings are

44:41.160 --> 44:45.280
a source of infatuation, but they're also a source of fear.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.400
The anima is beautiful and yet dreadful.

44:48.400 --> 44:54.600
Jung writes that many would dismiss such figures as merely flights of fancy, worthless, erotic

44:54.600 --> 44:55.600
fantasies.

44:55.600 --> 45:01.480
And he admits there is some truth to this, but it is not the whole truth, for such fantasies

45:01.480 --> 45:04.720
are not explained merely by calling them fantasies.

45:04.720 --> 45:10.100
And may, quote, complicate our psychic life in a most painful way.

45:10.100 --> 45:16.460
She comes upon us just as a nixie might, she sits on top of us like a succubus, she changes

45:16.460 --> 45:22.620
into all sorts of shapes, like a witch, and in general displays an unbearable independence

45:22.620 --> 45:27.780
that does not seem at all proper in a psychic content, end quote.

45:27.780 --> 45:32.420
These types of myths appear all over the world and are probably relatively familiar

45:32.440 --> 45:34.400
to most of us.

45:34.400 --> 45:39.640
Jung uses the term anima because the meaning of anima is soul, to which the German word

45:39.640 --> 45:42.560
seal is related.

45:42.560 --> 45:47.520
If we trace the etymology of this word to its Greek origins, we find its meaning as

45:47.520 --> 45:53.920
quick moving, changeful of hue, twinkling, likened to the butterfly.

45:53.920 --> 45:57.880
The soul is the breath, the magic breath that animates living beings.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.880
That which has soul is spirited, it is moving.

46:01.100 --> 46:07.180
Accordingly, Jung writes that the anima, quote, makes us believe incredible things that life

46:07.180 --> 46:09.940
may be lived, end quote.

46:09.940 --> 46:14.060
And we might think here of Schopenhauer's view of the feminine, tied in with his view

46:14.060 --> 46:20.060
of women, as that which seduces us to continue pursuing the will to live.

46:20.060 --> 46:25.060
Jung says that the anima, the feminine representation of the soul, is that which continually ensnares

46:25.060 --> 46:29.620
us, bringing us back to earth, back to nature.

46:29.620 --> 46:34.680
In fact, one can find such a representation of the feminine as both alluring and deadly

46:34.680 --> 46:38.960
in the very Judaic creation myth found in Genesis.

46:38.960 --> 46:43.080
Eve must convince Adam to eat of the forbidden fruit along with her.

46:43.080 --> 46:48.120
Of course, in the Jewish and in the Christian religious morality, this makes Eve the first

46:48.120 --> 46:50.760
sinner and Adam along with her.

46:50.760 --> 46:55.840
But Jung also brings out this element that the feminine spurs man on to his betterment

46:56.020 --> 47:01.900
to his elevation, which is sort of at tension with that, and perhaps a literalist take on

47:01.900 --> 47:04.360
the biblical creation myth.

47:04.360 --> 47:07.660
That's a theme in Goethe's Faust as well.

47:07.660 --> 47:12.420
It is in fact the final couplet of the play sung by the Chorus Mysticus, quote, the eternal

47:12.420 --> 47:15.780
feminine lures to perfection, end quote.

47:15.780 --> 47:20.620
And that connection is not lost on Jung, who would argue that Goethe's play is just as

47:20.640 --> 47:26.640
much an expression of these unconscious contents as any of our myths or ancient rituals were.

47:26.640 --> 47:32.640
Faust is the man who has ever drawn forward with his insatiable thirst for life, never

47:32.640 --> 47:34.520
satisfied.

47:34.520 --> 47:39.320
And the thing that draws him forward, whether it is Gretchen as he sees her image in the

47:39.320 --> 47:45.440
witches' mirror, or the image of Helen of Troy conjured into the modern day, it's the

47:45.460 --> 47:51.460
feminine that represents that for which Faust is always striving but can never reach.

47:51.460 --> 47:56.340
Helen of Troy quite literally transfigures into a cloud that Faust then grabs hold of

47:56.340 --> 47:59.080
and then rises up into the heavens.

47:59.080 --> 48:05.840
Jung quotes La Rochefoucault, who writes accordingly, quote, were it not for the leaping and twinkling

48:05.840 --> 48:12.840
of the soul, man would rot away in his greatest passion, idleness, end quote.

48:13.840 --> 48:19.540
Jung clarifies that he does not call the anima the soul in the sense of the immortal soul

48:19.540 --> 48:22.120
found in, for example, the Catholic doctrine.

48:22.120 --> 48:28.620
Jung refers us instead to classical sources such as Microbius or to the Taoist religion

48:28.620 --> 48:35.120
and the philosophical system of classical Chinese thought, wherein the Po, or the Kuei,

48:35.120 --> 48:41.320
quote, is regarded as the feminine and cathonic part of the soul, end quote.

48:41.400 --> 48:46.200
Jung writes of the anima in archetypes of the collective unconscious, quote, it is a

48:46.200 --> 48:52.560
factor in the proper sense of the word, man cannot make it, on the contrary, it is always

48:52.560 --> 48:58.400
the a priori element in his moods, reactions, impulses, or whatever else is spontaneous

48:58.400 --> 49:04.900
in psychic life, it is something that lives of itself, that makes us live, it is a life

49:04.900 --> 49:09.720
behind consciousness that cannot be completely integrated with it, but from which, on the

49:09.720 --> 49:12.840
contrary, consciousness arises.

49:12.840 --> 49:18.400
For in the last analysis, psychic life is for the greater part an unconscious life that

49:18.400 --> 49:21.640
surrounds consciousness on all sides.

49:21.640 --> 49:27.720
Although it seems as if the whole of our unconscious psychic life could be ascribed to the anima,

49:27.720 --> 49:32.360
she is yet only one archetype among many, therefore she is not characteristic of the

49:32.360 --> 49:36.560
unconscious in its entirety, she is only one of its aspects.

49:36.560 --> 49:40.000
This is shown by the very factor for femininity.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.800
What is not I, not masculine, is most probably feminine, and because the not I is felt as

49:45.800 --> 49:51.880
not belonging to me, and therefore as outside me, the anima image is usually projected upon

49:51.880 --> 49:53.600
women.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.240
Either sex is inhabited by the opposite sex up to a point.

49:57.240 --> 50:01.680
For biologically speaking, it is simply the greater number of masculine genes that tips

50:01.680 --> 50:03.800
the scales in favor of masculinity.

50:04.400 --> 50:08.840
The smaller number of feminine genes seems to form a feminine character which usually

50:08.840 --> 50:13.000
remains unconscious because of its subordinate position.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.040
With the archetype of the anima, we enter the realm of gods, or rather the realm that

50:17.040 --> 50:20.320
metaphysics has reserved for itself.

50:20.320 --> 50:27.160
Everything the anima touches becomes numinous, unconditional, dangerous, taboo, magical.

50:27.160 --> 50:32.400
She is the serpent in the paradise of the harmless man with good resolutions and still

50:32.400 --> 50:34.400
better intentions.

50:34.400 --> 50:39.080
She affords the most convincing reasons for not prying into the unconscious, an occupation

50:39.080 --> 50:44.040
that would break down our moral inhibitions and unleash forces that had been better left

50:44.040 --> 50:46.880
unconscious and undisturbed.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.200
End quote.

50:48.200 --> 50:53.680
So a few observations that many of you have probably already taken note of.

50:53.680 --> 50:58.720
For one, Jung's assessment of this first major character within the metaphysical world of

50:58.720 --> 51:02.680
the collective unconscious is that its gender is going to be the opposite of the conscious

51:02.680 --> 51:03.680
subject.

51:03.680 --> 51:07.600
So in the case of women, they would not possess an anima but an animus.

51:07.600 --> 51:12.960
The anima for men or animus for women is called the soul because it's the strongest, most

51:12.960 --> 51:18.760
powerful subpersonality within the unconscious contents, the most powerful factor in determining

51:18.760 --> 51:19.960
our thoughts and actions.

51:19.960 --> 51:25.040
It's the cathonic part of the soul because it's buried beneath the surface of consciousness,

51:25.040 --> 51:31.080
but it remains soul, the thing that animates, that draws us forward, seduces us to life.

51:31.080 --> 51:35.280
It is our image of the opposite gender contained within ourselves.

51:35.280 --> 51:40.400
And usually, as with the shadow, we never consciously perceive this psychic force.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.880
And thus we project it onto the opposite sex.

51:42.880 --> 51:47.120
A man will project onto women his image of the feminine, which is something coming from

51:47.120 --> 51:52.200
deep within his own unconsciousness and representative of his own wants and fears.

51:52.200 --> 51:56.320
And then he'll experience his own image of the feminine as something outside of himself,

51:56.320 --> 51:57.720
something not me.

51:57.720 --> 52:02.960
Jung relates a number of religious visions from Christian figures, including a Cistercian

52:02.960 --> 52:10.040
monk in the 1300s and a Swiss mystic in the 1500s, in which they saw, alongside God the

52:10.040 --> 52:17.280
Father, God the Mother, or alongside the King of Heaven, the Queen of Heaven.

52:17.280 --> 52:21.720
Such visions were completely inexplicable within the religious framework of European

52:21.720 --> 52:24.080
Christianity at that time.

52:24.080 --> 52:30.320
Such feminine interpretations of the divine had long since been excised from European

52:30.320 --> 52:36.160
religious thought, and God was the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, a trinity which

52:36.160 --> 52:37.560
is holy male.

52:37.560 --> 52:42.320
I mean, maybe there's some ambiguity with the Holy Spirit, but there's not a whole

52:42.320 --> 52:46.280
lot of female energy in that metaphor.

52:46.280 --> 52:50.720
So where did such visions come from, in which a holy man in Europe is confronted with the

52:50.720 --> 52:52.920
divine as female?

52:52.920 --> 53:00.000
Again, independently of tradition, we have records of such Cisigistic visions.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.560
Cisigy is the conjunction of two apparently opposite aspects, in this case the masculine

53:05.560 --> 53:09.280
and feminine as both perceived as divine.

53:09.280 --> 53:16.000
It's only natural that these two should appear as a mother-father pair, as they often do,

53:16.000 --> 53:19.080
and this is what is signified by God the Father and God the Mother.

53:19.600 --> 53:23.600
It should be noted at this point that this is Jung's way of dealing with the insights

53:23.600 --> 53:28.920
of Freud of incorporating what Freud had learned about the centrality of the family relationships

53:28.920 --> 53:34.800
to our psychic life, but without elevating the relationship with one's father and mother

53:34.800 --> 53:39.880
to the status of ultimate importance, as if the actual tangible father and mother in your

53:39.880 --> 53:44.480
upbringing are the determinative thing of how your psyche operates.

53:44.480 --> 53:48.120
That there is this collective unconscious contents of the image of the father, the image

53:48.160 --> 53:49.880
of the mother.

53:49.880 --> 53:55.480
In effect, the mother complex is another manifestation of the anima, another mask or face of the

53:55.480 --> 54:04.000
anima, because the anima is a numinous and alluring thing, the cathonic soul within a

54:04.000 --> 54:10.080
young man or a young boy will naturally project the anima at first onto his mother.

54:10.080 --> 54:14.680
The natural thing, however, is for the anima image to gradually lose its grandeur over the

54:14.720 --> 54:19.880
course of growing up, and eventually, when we come to understand our parents as just

54:19.880 --> 54:27.120
being ordinary human beings, and over time the anima sinks back into the unconsciousness,

54:27.120 --> 54:33.080
although Jung argues it loses none of its tension or its productivity.

54:33.080 --> 54:39.800
Jung then discusses the psychic effects it would have on a man to project his anima archetype

54:39.800 --> 54:41.640
in light of this.

54:41.640 --> 54:46.920
This is in, concerning the archetypes and the anima concept, quote,

54:46.920 --> 54:52.720
The love life of a man reveals the psychology of this archetype in the form either of boundless

54:52.720 --> 55:00.720
fascination, overvaluation, and infatuation, or of misogyny in all its gradations and variants,

55:00.720 --> 55:05.160
none of which can be explained by the real nature of the quote object in question, but

55:05.160 --> 55:08.840
only by a transference of the mother complex.

55:08.840 --> 55:13.360
The complex, however, was caused in the first place by the assimilation of the mother, in

55:13.360 --> 55:19.200
itself a normal and ubiquitous phenomenon, to the pre-existent feminine side of an archetypal

55:19.200 --> 55:24.960
male-female pair of opposites, and secondly by an abnormal delay in detaching from the

55:24.960 --> 55:28.240
primordial image of the mother.

55:28.240 --> 55:32.320
Actually nobody can stand the total loss of the archetype.

55:32.320 --> 55:37.680
When that happens, it gives rise to that frightful discontent in our culture where nobody feels

55:37.680 --> 55:42.000
at home because a father and mother are always missing.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.080
End quote, and a bit further in the essay Jung writes, quote,

55:46.080 --> 55:51.600
The anima is a factor of utmost importance in the psychology of a man, wherever the emotions

55:51.600 --> 55:54.600
and affects are at work.

55:54.600 --> 56:00.360
She intensifies, exaggerates, falsifies, and mythologizes all emotional relations with

56:00.360 --> 56:03.880
his work and with other people of both sexes.

56:03.880 --> 56:07.480
The resultant fantasies and entanglements are all her doing.

56:07.480 --> 56:12.640
When the anima is strongly constellated, she softens the man's character and makes him

56:12.640 --> 56:18.840
touchy, irritable, moody, jealous, vain, and unadjusted.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.360
End quote.

56:21.360 --> 56:27.240
So you may have also noted thus far Jung says that completely integrating one's anima is

56:27.240 --> 56:30.400
an impossible task.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.760
The well of the soul is very deep.

56:32.760 --> 56:37.560
No matter how fully you try to bring it into consciousness, some of it always recedes back

56:37.560 --> 56:39.280
into the depths of the mind.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.200
And so it should be, right?

56:41.200 --> 56:46.120
Because to become fully identified with this subordinate unconscious personality would

56:46.120 --> 56:47.680
not be a good idea.

56:47.680 --> 56:52.560
It would be the destruction of your actual conscious personality.

56:52.560 --> 56:57.240
But it's also not a good idea to completely banish these archetypes from our cultural

56:57.360 --> 57:05.960
or spiritual lexicon, to attempt to excise them or to smother them entirely in unconsciousness.

57:05.960 --> 57:11.480
And Jung does say that for young men, those who are 35 and younger, the most important

57:11.480 --> 57:16.640
thing in his view is for a man to be a man, and that they can live with even the almost

57:16.640 --> 57:19.160
total destruction of the anima.

57:19.160 --> 57:23.680
It may be different, he admits, with artists and other such types who might need the anima

57:23.720 --> 57:29.520
for their work, but it's primarily as a man begins to get older that the loss of the anima

57:29.520 --> 57:32.280
becomes particularly dangerous.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.280
Quote,

57:33.280 --> 57:38.840
After the middle of life, permanent loss of the anima means a diminution of vitality,

57:38.840 --> 57:41.600
of flexibility, and of human kindness.

57:41.600 --> 57:48.600
The result as a rule is premature, rigidity, crustiness, stereotypy, fanatical one-sidedness,

57:49.600 --> 57:56.600
obstinacy, pedantry, or else resignation, weariness, sloppiness, irresponsibility.

57:59.120 --> 58:03.680
What one realizes over the course of studying archetypes is that Jung truly thinks that

58:03.680 --> 58:07.400
these are independent sub-personalities.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.280
They have their own life and character.

58:10.280 --> 58:15.600
One has to reconcile with them to some extent, which means recognizing their existence and

58:15.600 --> 58:20.880
the role they play in your psychic life, but to become completely identified with an archetype

58:20.880 --> 58:25.400
would be just as catastrophic as trying to go to war with it.

58:25.400 --> 58:29.760
As you may have gleaned, neither of the types we've considered so far, the shadow or the

58:29.760 --> 58:34.200
anima, can be considered as wholly positive or wholly negative.

58:34.200 --> 58:39.800
As terrifying as the shadow is, as the trickster, he's a sort of gateway to the ideal self,

58:39.800 --> 58:41.960
to the savior or the redeemer.

58:41.960 --> 58:48.960
The anima draws forward the subject into the unknown, into the unknown seas, but also threatens

58:49.400 --> 58:52.520
the subject with the danger of drowning.

58:52.520 --> 58:57.800
So these types are multifaceted and they also have multiple faces to them that express different

58:57.800 --> 58:59.640
aspects of the archetype.

58:59.640 --> 59:03.680
So the great mother archetype is a subset of the anima, which could appear as one's

59:03.680 --> 59:08.920
personal mother or grandmother, she can appear as the mother of God, as the virgin, or as

59:08.920 --> 59:10.240
Sophia.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.120
These are all generally positive.

59:12.120 --> 59:15.440
These are inspiring forms of the mother type.

59:15.440 --> 59:20.280
But Jung writes, quote, all these symbols can have a positive favorable meaning or a

59:20.280 --> 59:22.440
negative evil meaning.

59:22.440 --> 59:29.720
An ambivalent aspect is seen in the goddesses of fate, Moira, Grashe, Norns.

59:29.720 --> 59:35.320
Evil symbols are the witch, the dragon, or any devouring or entwining animal, such as

59:35.400 --> 59:45.400
a large fish or serpent, the grave, sarcophagus, deep water, deep nightmares and bogies, impusa,

59:45.400 --> 59:49.240
lilyth, etc.

59:49.240 --> 59:54.080
The relationship that one will have with such archetypes will reflect their psychological

59:54.080 --> 59:57.280
realities and the realities of their own lives.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.680
And oftentimes the appearance of such a symbol is an unconscious hint as to some imbalance

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.880
or pathology.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:11.080
If one is having repeated visitations of Mahakali in their dreams, constantly experiencing the

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:16.400
great mother as something terrible and all devouring, it may be an indication of anima

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.000
inflation in the person's psychology.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.840
The sub-personality of the anima becoming all-conquering and unchallenged and beginning

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:30.200
to dominate and to push the conscious subject's behavior in ways that might not even be perceptible

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.280
to him.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.040
We'll consider a few other important archetypes that Jung identifies.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:43.000
Jung writes, quote, the archetype of the child god is extremely widespread and intimately

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.840
bound up with all the other mythological aspects of the child motif, end quote.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.400
Of course, in European Christianity we have the symbolism of the Christ child, to which

01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:00.280
we return every Christmas, it's a celebration of God's birth on earth where we see God

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.480
as the child.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.800
Jung also, however, brings in a discussion of folklore, of dwarves and elves and little

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.960
people who inhabit the deep places and the mine shafts.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.880
And on the other hand, the child appears as a recurring theme in mystical experience,

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.040
Meister Eckhart's vision of the naked boy.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.880
It appears in English ghost stories, the apparition of the radiant boy.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:32.480
Jung writes in psychology of the child archetype, quote, the child motif not infrequently occurs

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.600
in the field of psychopathology.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.320
The quote imaginary child is common among women with mental disorders and is usually

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.040
interpreted in a Christian sense.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.560
Hamonkili also appear, as in the famous Schreiber case, where they come in swarms and plague

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.560
the sufferer.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:55.520
But the clearest and most significant manifestation of the child motif in the therapy of neuroses

01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:02.000
is in the maturation process of personality induced by the analysis of the unconscious,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.800
which I have termed the process of individuation.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.440
Here we are confronted with pre-conscious processes, which in the form of more or less

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:15.720
well-formed fantasies gradually pass over into the conscious mind, or become conscious

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:22.440
as dreams, or lastly, are made conscious through the method of active imagination.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.560
This material is rich in archetypal motifs, among them frequently that of the child.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.320
Often the child is formed after the Christian model, more often though it develops from

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.400
earlier altogether non-Christian levels.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:43.000
That is to say, out of catholic animals, such as crocodiles, dragons, serpents, or monkeys.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.840
Sometimes the child appears in the cup of a flower, or out of a golden egg, or as the

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.000
center of a mandala.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:55.560
In dreams it often appears as the dreamer's son or daughter, or as a boy, youth, or young

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560
girl.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.120
Occasionally it seems to be of exotic origin, Indian or Chinese, with a dusky skin, or appearing

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:07.720
more cosmically surrounded by stars, or with a starry coronet, or as the king's son, or

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.360
the witch's child with demonic attributes.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:17.000
Seen as a special instance of the treasure hard to attain motif, the child motif is extremely

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.240
variable, and assumes all manner of shapes, such as the jewel, the pearl, the flower,

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.320
the chalice, the golden egg, the quaternity, the golden ball, and so on.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.320
It can be interchanged with these, and similar images almost without limit.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.200
So what are we to make of a passage like this?

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:44.480
On the one hand, Jung seems to include so many images of the child archetype, that it's

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.520
very coherence might seem to be hard to grasp.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:52.840
On the other hand, what Jung is doing here is pointing to, in his view, an irrational

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.940
and arbitrary series of associations that the psyche has made between seemingly unrelated

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.760
objects or symbols.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.280
That this is really what we might call poetic license.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.680
It's one of the main things that seems to differentiate our thought as human beings.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:14.680
We have the capability to make poetic leaps, but what this involves is associating two

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:21.360
different phenomena by way of metaphor, and the unconscious is similarly artistic in this

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.360
way.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.000
It makes these metaphorical associations.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.120
As the child archetype is the treasure hard to attain, the child could appear as a radiant

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.280
jewel or as a radiant infant.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:39.640
Jung believes that the child archetype appears when one has, in some way, sundered themselves

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.560
from their own character.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:47.040
What he means by this is that we can occasionally act in ways that accord more with an arbitrary

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.800
persona that we have adopted than in line with our actual values.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.280
The way that we feel we should act, deep in our gut and our intuition.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.920
The demands of the social life lead us to adopt such arbitrary personas, a mask that

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:08.200
one puts on due to the requirements of his job or his social relationships or his church

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.800
or his marriage and family life, whatever it might be.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.120
We might be forced to make ourselves appear as something that we're not, and so far as

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.600
our inner feelings might be completely at odds with our outward persona.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:27.400
If we then act according to the needs or desires of this artificial character that we've created,

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.760
we may then encounter the child archetype.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:37.480
Jung says that one sees the child, for example, in dreams, when he becomes, quote, unchildlike

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:44.280
and artificial, end quote, and when he, quote, has lost his roots, end quote.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:51.000
The thing hard to attain, then, somewhat conjures the imagery of one's childhood.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.960
But Jung argues this is not purely a yearning for some romantic version of one's youth

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.360
or one's childhood days.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.400
Jung says that, quote, the child motif represents not only something that existed in the distant

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.520
past, but also something that exists now, that is to say, it is not just a vestige but

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:15.360
a system functioning in the present, whose purpose is to compensate or correct, in a

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:21.520
meaningful manner, the inevitable one-sidedness and extravagances of the conscious mind, end

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.560
quote.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:29.080
This is why the child motif occurs when patients are undergoing what Jung calls individuation.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:34.680
They come to realize the ways in which artificial personas have compromised their values.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:40.000
The child is a symbol of one's creativity, of the innocent self-absorption in one's

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.540
setting, a presentness of thought and attitude.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:50.160
The child motif, therefore, suggests to us that, yes, we have lived in this manner in

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.400
the past, and that there is a possibility to return there in the future, to get it over

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.320
the one-sidedness, as Jung calls it.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:09.280
The child, therefore, represents not the past, but the future.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:15.920
The child promises some future possibility of individuation or wholeness, and, therefore,

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:22.100
its appearance is like Virgil appearing to Dante when he's lost in the wood of error.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.360
The radiant child appears to you when you become lost.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:31.280
The child motif, therefore, often depicts a child hero or a child god, a figure which

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.240
is at once vulnerable but indestructible.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.400
He's often born into danger or privation, as Moses was placed into the river by his

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:47.280
birth mother so that he could survive, or Jesus' mother giving birth to him in a manger.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.740
He's smaller than small and bigger than big at the same time.

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.940
The child is always there in our mind as an eternal warning or a sign that we have gone

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:00.580
astray in order that we may set right our course.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:05.580
A child is vulnerable because we know that in this world we're often in real danger

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:10.100
of completely losing our connection to that innocence, that creativity that is the healthy

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.220
state of the soul.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:17.580
And obviously, at this point, it bears mentioning the child is that final transfiguration of

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:22.140
the spirit in Nietzsche's schema as he gives it in Zarathustra's prologue.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:28.180
And so from this, a Jungian analysis might lead us to suspect that Nietzsche gravitated

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:33.180
to the child motif because he unconsciously understood the role of the child as a sign

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.340
and symbol of self-transformation and individuation.

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:43.220
And perhaps Nietzsche was able to perceive this because he himself may have been someone

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:49.660
at odds with his, between his outer persona and his inner values, so to speak, perhaps

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:56.260
during the latter days of his teaching at Basel or his time spent among the Wagnerians.

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.340
Another important archetypal figure is the wise old man.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:07.180
He can appear as an old king, a wisened magician, a father, or a grandfather.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:13.980
In mythology, he is Odin, Osiris, Jupiter, arguably the image of the wise old man as

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:18.500
an archetype is painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:23.620
This seems to have been the archetype that Michelangelo used to portray God.

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:30.580
The wise old man is the superior, the master, the teacher, and in some way represents the

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.220
anchoring wisdom on which one's life is based.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:39.620
The wise old man is the superstructure of one's thought, one's morality, their understanding

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.940
of the reality they inhabit and how they fit into that reality.

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:49.340
Jung says that when one's worldview, their way of comprehending themselves, is profoundly

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:54.820
challenged, this is often when the wise old man appears.

01:09:54.820 --> 01:10:00.580
Perhaps for example, when one is losing their religion, Jung relates the story of a young

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:07.660
theologian who had a dream in which two wise old magicians appeared to him, a white magician

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:11.900
wearing black robes and a black magician wearing white robes.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:16.660
In the dream, the black magician tells the story of an old king from a far away land

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:20.820
who had scoured all the land searching for a tomb for himself.

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:24.940
In his land were many great old tombs and he wished to find the best, but when they

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:30.260
found one in which a virgin had been buried, they exhumed her bones.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:35.420
His bones didn't stay dead, but got up, formed into a black horse which then galloped across

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.820
the desert.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:42.300
The magician followed the horse until he found grassland and the horse grazing there.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:47.600
He'd now found the keys to paradise and did not know what to do with them.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.020
This is perhaps the most Jungian dream I've ever heard, so kudos to Jung for managing

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.860
to get this one from someone he says he did not even know personally, I mean it's just

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:58.660
incredible.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.220
But in any case, this theologian was going through something in his life at the time,

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:07.700
which was of monumental importance, a shift or a transformation that could have life-altering

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.420
consequences.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:16.300
That is Jung says, quote, he was in great straits because of his religious beliefs, end quote.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.740
Which is a bit vague, but if we read between the lines, we can infer that in some ways

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:26.900
that theologian's beliefs probably drifted from those which were acceptable, maybe according

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:31.300
to the dogma of the seminary, perhaps he was losing his faith altogether, we don't really

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.460
know.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:37.820
In any case, he was confronted with the strong drive to leave behind the current mental structure

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:44.220
of his worldview, to lay to rest the old king, so to speak, and thus to strike out across

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:46.140
the desert.

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.380
And what is it that strikes out across the desert?

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:53.660
Well it's the black horse, which is formed from the bones of the virgin buried in the

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.820
tomb in the old country.

01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:02.140
So the anima, the soul we might say, has become dead, dry, dusty bones within the reign of

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.220
an old kingdom.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.820
And once the king decided to lay himself to rest, so to speak, the soul jumps up.

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:12.500
It runs out into the unknown until it finds a new green pasture.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.940
And by following it, following the drive of the soul, the black magician finds the keys

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:24.940
to paradise, the treasure hard to obtain, the holy grail, the return to the walled garden.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:31.460
Jung writes, quote, the two magicians are indeed two aspects of the wise old man, the

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:36.940
superior master and teacher, the archetype of the spirit who symbolizes the pre-existent

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:40.260
meaning hidden in the chaos of life.

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:45.020
He is the father of the soul, and yet the soul in some miraculous manner is also his

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:51.940
virgin mother, for which reason he was called by the alchemists the first son of the mother.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:57.300
The black magician and the black horse correspond to the descent into darkness and the dreams

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.300
mentioned earlier.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.460
What an inappropriately hard lesson for a young student of theology.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.900
Fortunately, he was not in the least sense aware that the father of all prophets had

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:13.220
spoken to him in the dream and placed a great secret almost within his grasp.

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:19.340
One marvels at the inappropriateness of such occurrences.

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:24.500
There is another famous idea of the archetype of the wise man that can be found in the literature,

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.620
and we're all familiar with it here.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.380
Zarathustra himself.

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:34.700
Jung writes that Zarathustra is Nietzsche's psychic image of, quote, the enlightener,

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:39.980
the master and teacher, a psychopomp whose personification even Nietzsche, that breaker

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.780
of tablets, could not escape, end, quote.

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:48.540
Jung continues in the same passage, and I'm reading here in an abridged form, quote, for

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:54.580
him God was dead, but the driving demon of wisdom became, as it were, his bodily double.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.420
Zarathustra is more for Nietzsche than a poetic figure.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:04.460
He is an involuntary confession, a testament, end, quote.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:09.380
Jung argues that in the nihilistic darkness that Nietzsche, in the wake of abandoning

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:17.300
God and abandoning Christianity, he created a void that required a figure that would speak

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:21.380
in the hieratic language of Zarathustra.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:27.300
He chooses, as the image of this figure, one of the founders of the world religions, a

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:33.620
prophet of ancient times, a man who divided good and evil.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:40.500
Zarathustra proclaims the relativity and relatedness of good and evil, and Nietzsche's version

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.820
of events.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:46.300
This is Zarathustra as the first man to make the distinction, also being the first to realize

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.540
his mistake.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:54.620
But we might also notice, in the dream of the theologian that Jung described, we see the

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:59.260
symbolism of the relativity of good and evil there, too, in the figures of the white and

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:05.580
black magicians, both of whom are wise men, both of whom have mismatched names.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:10.980
Jung argues that this perceived interdependence of good and evil, far from being an invention

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:17.460
of Nietzsche's mind, is one of the oldest bits of wisdom in human religiosity.

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:21.820
Jung cites a saying from India that the man who loves God will take seven lifetimes to

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:26.660
reach perfection, while the man who hates him will take only three lifetimes.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:31.180
And this is because the man who hates God will think of him more often.

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:36.580
Jung also suggests that this relativity, this freedom from opposition, due to a perception

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:42.020
of their functional equivalence, is also found in Taoist philosophy.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:46.900
For that, one might look to the Zhuangzi, or to the Dao De Ching.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:52.100
While this may offend mainline Christian sensibilities, there are even strains of Christian thought

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:56.700
in which God's allowance of evil in the world is seen as a good thing, because it allows

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:59.460
for the overcoming of sin.

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:06.540
Or in Hebrew, the Yatzahara, the evil inclination, the inclination of man to sin, which is considered

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.500
to be in itself valuable.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:14.980
It was placed there by God for a good reason, because in the overcoming of sin we glorify

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.780
God.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.540
Zarathustra then speaks some of that same wisdom of the ultimate relativity of good

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:28.220
and evil, the dependence of one upon the other, and he stands as a wise religious teacher,

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.740
in a world darkened by the death of God.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:38.060
These niches creation of a mystical wise man out of a deep need, the deeply felt absence

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.220
of this anchoring structure for our thought.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:47.500
And so Zarathustra becomes yet another figure who teaches us the pre-existent meaning behind

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.220
the chaos of life, which is the meaning of the wise old man.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:57.340
That figure of the wise man as teacher, Jung says, is one of the type's definite aspects,

01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:02.740
appearing in mythology as Hermes, Trismegistus, Thoth, Orpheus.

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:09.700
Quote, if the name Lucifer were not prejudicial, it would be a very suitable one for this archetype.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:14.660
But I have been content to call it the archetype of the wise old man, or of meaning.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:19.540
Like all archetypes, it has a positive and a negative aspect.

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.260
End quote.

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:28.100
Every one of these archetypes we've discussed so far has so many variations in which it

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.660
can appear, and there's just so much more that can be said about each of these archetypes

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.100
than could be said in a single episode.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:42.340
And Jung wishes to stress that what he is imparting to us in his work is more than anything

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:49.100
a language, a lexicon, a kind of rough guide, a guide to the perplexed for those who wish

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.500
to embark on that project of individuation.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.860
Moving from a state of inner turmoil to a state of health.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:00.660
Jung's understanding of the psyche is not, by any means, to be taken as a dogmatic set

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:05.340
of inflexible truths that we should refer to in lieu of experience.

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:10.300
Furthermore, he stresses that when it comes to dealing with these archetypes, these sub-complexes

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:16.060
of the mind, there is nothing that he can give us that will serve as an easy set of

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:19.420
do-it-yourself instructions that will work in all cases.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:22.980
The concrete situation of the person is what matters.

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.940
Everyone has their own unique battle to fight.

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:30.860
Jung writes, quote, it is not sufficient just to know about these concepts and to reflect

01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:36.300
on them, nor can we ever experience their content by feeling our way into them, or by

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.180
appropriating other people's feelings.

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:43.060
It is no use at all to learn a list of archetypes by heart.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:47.820
Types are complexes of experience that come upon us like fate and their effects are felt

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.980
in our most personal life.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:56.100
The anima no longer crosses our path as a goddess, but it may be as an intimately personal

01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:00.660
misadventure, or perhaps as our best venture.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:05.660
When for instance a highly esteemed professor in his seventies abandons his family and runs

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:11.260
off with a young red-headed actress, we know that the gods have claimed another victim.

01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:15.100
This is how demonic power reveals itself to us.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:20.620
Until not so long ago, it would have been an easy matter to do away with the young woman

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:24.340
as a witch, end quote.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:29.980
And so Jung thinks that we are not in any way wiser than the type of people Jung here

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:35.100
calls primitives, people who have continued to live according to the life patterns of

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:41.220
say pre-industrial society, or even pre-agricultural society, who continue to see the world in

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.860
terms of these myths and rituals.

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:50.780
Jung writes, quote, the primitive mentality does not invent myths, it experiences them,

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:52.460
end quote.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:55.940
Their way of thinking about their own mind is more honest than ours.

01:19:55.940 --> 01:20:00.540
They still speak in a language of gods and spirits, but their understanding of the self

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:07.060
is not corrupted by these modern notions of the voluntarily governing ego who lives autonomously

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:10.060
and acts autonomously, thinks autonomously.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:14.340
Such a way of thinking just ignores the reality of the unconscious drives.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:20.020
And so Jung writes, and this is in Psychology of the Child archetype, paragraph 260 of the

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:27.220
collected works volume 9, quote, in the individual, the archetypes appear as involuntary manifestations

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:32.580
of unconscious processes whose existence and meaning can only be inferred, whereas the

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:37.340
myth deals with traditional forms of incalculable age.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:42.900
They hark back to a prehistoric world whose spiritual preconceptions and general conditions

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.700
we can still observe today in existing primitives.

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:52.380
Myths on this level are as a rule tribal history handed down from generation to generation

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.420
by word of mouth.

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:59.180
Primitive mentality differs from the civilized chiefly in that the conscious mind is far

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.460
less developed in scope and intensity.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:07.980
Primitives such as thinking, willing, etc. are not yet differentiated, they are pre-conscious,

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.260
and in the case of thinking, for instance, this shows itself in the circumstance that

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:17.420
the primitive does not think consciously, but that thoughts appear.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:22.500
The primitive cannot assert that he thinks, it is rather something that thinks in him.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:28.060
The spontaneity of the act of thinking does not lie causally in his conscious mind, but

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:32.760
in his unconscious.

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:36.780
This is, in effect, the Nietzschean picture of thought as well, as he discusses in Beyond

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:42.500
Good and Evil, that the true vital germ of thought, even philosophical thought, is a

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:49.620
drive, some sort of unconscious motivation, which may be moral or immoral, that the constitutive

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:56.100
element of thought is not truth, or the will to seek the truth, but that it is the will

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.940
to truth of a drive.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:03.420
Jung's further elaboration on this notion of Nietzsche's is simply that he dares to

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:09.260
identify the different types of certain definite complexes of thought.

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:13.380
We might call them complexes of feelings, or of sentiments, or of impulses, but all

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:17.140
such complexes have their own form of reasoning as well.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:23.740
To return to that first essay we discussed archetypes of the collective unconscious,

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:29.700
Jung makes it clear that this way of thinking, understood by the primitive mythologically,

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:35.700
is how Jung would describe our thought, albeit with the modern language of psychoanalysis.

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700
Quote,

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:42.540
There is no single important idea or view that does not possess historical antecedents.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:48.100
Ultimately, they are founded on primordial archetypal forms whose concreteness dates

01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:53.100
from a time when consciousness did not think but only perceived.

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:58.420
Thoughts were objects of interperception, not thought at all but sensed as external phenomena,

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.620
seen or heard, so to speak.

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.740
Thought was essentially revelation, not invented but forced upon us, or bringing conviction

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:09.140
through its immediacy and actuality.

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:13.740
Thinking of this kind precedes the primitive ego consciousness, and the latter is more its

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.260
object than its subject.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:21.580
But we ourselves have not yet climbed the last peak of consciousness, so we have a pre-existent

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:27.180
thinking of which we are not aware so long as we are supported by traditional symbols,

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:35.220
or to put it in the language of dreams, so long as the father or the king is not dead.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.780
End quote.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:44.500
What Jung offers us is, in a description that may seem somewhat reductivist or anti-climatic,

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.500
a table of categories.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:51.260
And I should note, I don't mean it in a reductive way, I think his table of categories is incredibly

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:56.800
useful, and that it is at least hard to argue that there aren't certain definite repeated

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.140
types that appear in the mythic landscape of human thought.

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:07.340
Many today still balk at these ideas, however, but I would simply ask, what is their alternative?

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:14.060
There is no recognizable pattern, no recognizable meaning within the human psyche whatsoever.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:20.660
There's nothing that unites humanity cross-culturally, that the individual pathologies of human beings

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:25.340
are so peculiar or unique or random that we can't make any descriptive sense of them

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:27.940
at all as categories.

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:33.140
I think that is, funnily enough, a fairly unscientific way of viewing the human mind,

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:38.420
which is funny because people often accuse Jung of being unscientific.

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:42.580
I think whether you agree with Jung or not, he provides us with a useful tool set, a useful

01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:47.300
lexicon for approaching the human mind, and a fascinating commentary on the relation of

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:51.100
psychology to the world's religions and cultures.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.700
But of course Jung also relates to Nietzsche in a far deeper way than merely carrying on

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.700
his influence.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:01.660
In many ways Jung was a critic of Nietzsche, he strongly disagreed with many of Nietzsche's

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:06.180
moral conclusions, and furthermore he was one of the first critics to analyze Nietzsche's

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.100
philosophy in consideration of his mental illness.

01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:14.340
This critical relationship between Jung and Nietzsche, however, I think is a very rich

01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:20.340
Much like the criticism of Socrates by Nietzsche, Jung is often times in a kind of struggle

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:24.940
with Nietzsche in his writing, and even though his philosophy thoroughly rebukes the Nietzschean

01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:30.180
moral and cultural project, there's a sense in which Jung recognizes Nietzsche's viewpoint

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:34.700
as valuable and as indispensable for the development of his own thought.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:39.340
It's in response to Nietzsche that some of Jung's most profound ideas are created.

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:44.340
We're going to talk about that next time when we invite Nietzsche to come in, take a seat,

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:49.340
lie down, whatever makes you more comfortable here, Nietzsche, as you're about to be psychoanalyzed.

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:55.340
Join me then for Nietzsche on Jung's couch, Jung's psychoanalytic critique of Nietzsche

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.340
and his ideas.

01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.340
Signing off.

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:16.340
Or just share the show with any of your friends that you think might enjoy it or on social media.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.340
Thank you for your support.
