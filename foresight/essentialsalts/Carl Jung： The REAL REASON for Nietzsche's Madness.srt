1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We first discussed Nietzsche's infamous aphorism entitled The Madman way back in the early days of the podcast, I think Episode 3.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is the aphorism that contains Nietzsche's famous declaration that God is dead, that all that man once aspired to, all that man once saw as his noble ideal, all that anchored us and gave meaning to our lives and the suffering within our lives.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That great idea of God would not survive modernity.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For Nietzsche, this is the most momentous and calamitous of events, but it is above all the blunt reality.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Our situation in the modern world is that we have to move on from the Christian God and create ourselves anew in the light of that knowledge.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That we must impart meaning to our own lives, craft new ideals, anchor our understanding of reality by new means.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The entire revaluation of values takes place in the wake of God's death, and it's only really comprehensible as a response to God's death.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is why it's such a foundational concept in approaching Nietzsche.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
His whole mature philosophy exists in the aftermath of the death of God, and I would dare say that it would be incoherent for anyone who has not perceived this.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Nietzsche's answer to this challenge is also taken up by Freud, Jung's former mentor.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For both Nietzsche and Freud, the looming end of Christianity that was unfolding in modernity was truly the end of Christianity.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The answer was psychology, a grounding of our understanding of mankind in naturalistic terms.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For whatever their differences, both Nietzsche and Freud would argue that the only way out is forward.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A return to the mental framework of a mythological past does not seem to be an option for the modern man.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Nietzsche writes not in favor of a romantic return, but an active nihilism, a critique of all modern values, the full recognition of the way in which the highest values have devalued themselves.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This lays waste to the whole field of moral ideas, but that may clear the way for new possibilities.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Myths may ever remain a profound source of meaning, but Nietzsche and Freud see in the gods evidence of one's physiological drives in impulses.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Where Jung differs is that he sees in one's physiological impulses the evidence of the gods.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Jung, in effect, comes to the opposite conclusions of Freud, that the significance found in myth and religion is so profound that we ought to understand psychology in terms of myth,

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
rather than attempt to psychologize away the apparent significance of myth.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Jung's judgment, his evaluation of the situation for the modern man, is profound, and it's radical.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Jung perceives that these archetypal subcomplexes seem to appear independently of tradition or culture,

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and he argues that we should treat them precisely in accordance with all that this discovery demands.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That is, treat the archetypes as independent, definite entities, real beings, spirits, so to speak, perhaps even deities.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
At least that's the way they would have been understood mythologically, and given that they do seem to appear independent of these factors of culture or upbringing,

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's just further evidence of the fact that they should be afforded this kind of respect or awe.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Jung sees the ways in which the modern lexicon for understanding ourselves, for understanding the psyche, has become impoverished.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:04,000
How it has overestimated the ego, overestimated the benign nature of man, or the goodness of man, overestimated the power of rationality.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In all of these respects, he agrees with Nietzsche, but Jung draws attention to the fact that the mindset of people who lived in the ages of so-called mythic thinking

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
was far closer to the truth of the self than our modern, essentialist view of the ego consciousness as this arbitrary, rational ruler.

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Jung's work with schizophrenic patients, his study of dreams, and his tour of the world's religions, this had all convinced him that there was a concrete truth to religion that could not simply be hand-waved away.

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Perhaps we could say, at the very least, a concrete usefulness or utility to religion.

33
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That it was our only way to confront the numinous, the mysterious, the most important events of life, coming of age, self-transformation, passing into death, and so on and so forth.

34
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It is the very fact that Jung can easily observe in his patients that they unconsciously employ religious symbolism.

35
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This convinces him that, in fact, God is not dead in the sense that Nietzsche means this utterance, that we may have the pretensions of having done away with God,

36
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but perhaps this only really applies in the realm of the rational intellect that now lives in a sort of mechanistic world.

37
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But in the unconsciousness God lives on, that God's still are the set of symbols that we use to express that type of thinking.

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And so it seems almost incredible that Nietzsche, a man who was suspicious of the powers of the intellect and emphasized the relative dominance of the unconscious part of the psyche,

39
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
could have construed the death of God as some sort of objective event or objective happening.

40
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because after all, such an event has only happened in the terms understood by the ego consciousness and its representations of reality.

41
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That is to say that the divine is part of the independently living world of spirits that exists in the collective unconsciousness,

42
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
which is larger and more complex than any mask which the consciousness gives to it.

43
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That we have oftentimes changed our symbols for the divine in accord with the perception of the age,

44
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
but this transfiguration from one symbol to another is not indicative of the final death and repose of the divine as such,

45
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
but part of a cycle of death and rebirth which is itself part of that divine language.

46
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
God is part of our inner life, a self bigger than the ego with its pretensions to total freedom.

47
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
God in one form or another may slip away from us.

48
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
One divine symbol autonomously departs from our sight.

49
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But Jung writes about this quote,

50
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Because this inner life is intrinsically free and not subject to our will and intentions,

51
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it may easily happen that the living thing chosen and defined by us will drop out of its setting,

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the man-made image, even against our will.

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Then perhaps we could say with Nietzsche, God is dead.

54
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yet it would be truer to say, he has put off our image and where shall we find him again?

55
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The interregnum is full of danger, for the natural facts will raise their claim in the form of various isms,

56
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
which are productive of nothing but anarchy and destruction,

57
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
because inflation and man's hybris between them have elected to make the ego with all its ridiculous paltryness, Lord of the Universe.

58
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That was the case with Nietzsche, the uncomprehended portent of a whole epoch.

59
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
End quote.

60
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Jung here references the fact that Nietzsche predicted massive violence in the rise of new political ideologies

61
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
as attempts to grapple with the coming nihilism.

62
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is the great prophecy of Nietzsche that concerns the history of the coming two centuries, as he says,

63
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
which I've often filled later interpreters of Nietzsche with terror and wonder,

64
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
as we're all struck in the present day with how accurate Nietzsche's predictions were.

65
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The isms in light of retrospective analysis would, of course, be communism, Nazism,

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
these outbursts within the interregnum.

67
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The meaning of that word is the period between kings, usually a time of unrest or civil war.

68
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
To use the language of myth, when one old king meets his downfall, there's a period in which there's a great danger.

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The society finds itself beyond the protection of a perceived order to the world,

70
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and another king must rise up to take charge of the kingdom.

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Still, Jung's remarks about Nietzsche's egotism are biting.

72
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's striking that a man who disparaged the ego consciousness so much,

73
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
who had so little regard for its pretensions, would nevertheless be, for all intents and purposes, so egotistical.

74
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So, confident in his own strength to endure hard truths and live in the moral, ideological desert

75
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
beyond the approval of the collective and so on, Jung continues in the same passage, quote,

76
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The individual ego is much too small.

77
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Its brain is much too feeble to incorporate all the projections withdrawn from the world.

78
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ego and brain burst asunder in the effort.

79
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The psychiatrist calls it schizophrenia.

80
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
When Nietzsche said God is dead, he uttered a truth which is valid for the greater part of Europe.

81
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
People were influenced by it not because he said so, but because it stated a widespread psychological fact.

82
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The consequences were not long delayed after the fog of isms, the catastrophe.

83
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Nobody thought of drawing the slightest conclusions from Nietzsche's pronouncement,

84
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
yet it has, for some ears, the same eerie sound as that ancient cry which came echoing over the sea

85
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
to mark the end of the nature gods.

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Great Pan is dead, end quote.

87
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The story that Jung references here is a strange one.

88
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a sort of fable that comes to us through the historical record.

89
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It almost reads like a rumor or just a strange story that was bandied about the Uso Bar in ancient Greece,

90
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but it's an example of what Jung called synchronicity,

91
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
where events which are seemingly unrelated in terms of causality, in terms of the material world,

92
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
are nevertheless related in terms of their underlying meaning.

93
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They're related in a deeper way than our rationality can explain.

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We find this story in Jung's notes from a seminar on Nietzsche's Zarathustra given in the 1930s.

95
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The background context of the conversation is Jung's assessment of Nietzsche,

96
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
what he calls Nietzsche's inflation with an archetype, in this case, with Zarathustra.

97
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
In Jung's view, any one of the archetypes can become inflated,

98
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
meaning that within the community of drives, impulses, sub complexes within one's unconscious,

99
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
one particular complex begins swallowing up a great deal of energy,

100
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
growing larger than the others, literally becoming inflated, you can use that image.

101
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And eventually the inflation reaches a point where the individual begins to consciously identify with the archetype.

102
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It becomes a kind of usurpacious persona, to where it becomes so big that it swells to include the ego consciousness within it.

103
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So this is an excerpt from that seminar.

104
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Dr. Jung.

105
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
For Nietzsche, the world was always exceedingly dull.

106
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Nobody had ears or eyes or a feeling heart, so he had to knock at the doors with a sledgehammer.

107
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But when people locked the doors, he attacked them with such fearful words that they became frightened.

108
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
His contemporary Jacob Burkhart, the famous historian, grew quite afraid when he read Zarathustra,

109
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
as I know from people in Basel who were acquainted with them both.

110
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It was uncanny to him.

111
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It was the language that overcame him.

112
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He shut the door to Nietzsche because he was too troublesome, he made too big a noise,

113
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
and one always has the impression in reading Zarathustra that it does not really reach people.

114
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Nietzsche felt that too, and therefore he increased the weight of it in order to make it sink in.

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If only he would wait, be a bit more patient, a bit less noisy, then it would sink in.

116
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Certain passages in Zarathustra are of supreme beauty, but others are in very bad taste,

117
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and the effect of the whole is somewhat endangered by that style.

118
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Those are the main reasons for it then, but there is still another point which explains the extraordinary weight of Zarathustra.

119
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Mrs. Adler

120
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It is because the aspirations or intuitions are not quite real, and therefore they need a particular emphasis, as it were, against Nietzsche,

121
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
as if he were preaching to himself in the first place.

122
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Dr. Jung

123
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That is a very subtle point of view.

124
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It is surely a valid argument, since there is plenty of evidence that what we would call realization had not taken place.

125
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Mrs. Baines

126
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't understand what Mrs. Adler means by there not being quite real to him.

127
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Dr. Jung

128
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It would mean, in this case, not quite realized, as a matter of fact, when there is an inflation by an archetype, there is no realization.

129
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
One cannot realize the thing by which one is inflated.

130
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
First, the inflation must have come to an end, and then one may realize, not before.

131
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Dr. Reichstein

132
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Perhaps it was because Nietzsche was against the whole world, and so he had to knock very hard.

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Dr. Jung

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes, that is quite certain.

135
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Nietzsche was in a sort of fighting position against the whole contemporary world, and it gave him a peculiar feeling of inefficiency that his words reached nowhere,

136
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
no echo anywhere.

137
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That really was the case.

138
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nobody cared.

139
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
His was the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, and so naturally he would increase his voice instead of lowering it.

140
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You see, when one is not understood, one should, as a rule, lower one's voice, because when one really speaks loudly enough and is not heard, it is because people don't want to hear.

141
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
One had better begin to mutter to oneself than they get curious.

142
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
End quote.

143
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So, lots of very clever remarks from Jung and his colleagues in this excerpt from the seminar, but Jung's main criticism here is actually an attack on the style of Zarathustra, which is interesting.

144
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Some passages are beautiful, others in bad taste, and he sees this as a result of Nietzsche forcing certain things.

145
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And one of Jung's students suggests that this forcing is a result of the fact that Nietzsche may not have fully realized the truths contained in the book, that he is preaching to himself as much as to everyone else,

146
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that's the way they put it.

147
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Jung believes this is a valid point of view on Nietzsche's work, and it is a variation on the common refrain among Nietzsche's critics that Nietzsche himself was not a hard, immoral, tyrannical kind of man.

148
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
By all accounts, he was a kind, moral gentleman.

149
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Well, didn't Nietzsche say that one does not have a quote-unquote right to all truths, and that for this very reason, that truth can't be regarded as universal?

150
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Perhaps it was the case that Nietzsche himself did not have a right to every last truth that he wrote in the Spokes Zarathustra.

151
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And so the Jungian view of the situation would be, this is because as the archetype is inflating itself and taking over Nietzsche's psyche, he as the whole subject is not actually coming into the realization of the truths known by the archetype.

152
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He does not gain a right to them to use Nietzsche's language, just merely on the basis of the archetypal inflation.

153
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And there's still the truths of someone else, because Zarathustra is operating as a kind of autonomous subpersonality at this point.

154
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And so perhaps because Zarathustra sort of confronts Nietzsche with certain ideas, perhaps his most dangerous, blasphemous, or harsh ideas, that Nietzsche himself does not fully believe,

155
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and by this we mean, does not fully realize in his life maybe, he does not live these ideas, he does not have a right to them.

156
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Perhaps his work is forced in some places, or it feels forced, the style, because he's preaching to himself, trying to get himself to adopt ideas that are not really his.

157
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And the way that Nietzsche talks about the experience of writing Zarathustra, he says that the ideas just sort of flashed before him like lightning.

158
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That this truly was a book written by a muse, he often uses that language in talking about it.

159
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And so there is somewhat of a basis in the textual evidence for Jung's position here, and in my view this is the most biting thing that Jung says.

160
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Because it's a criticism not just of Nietzsche's ideas, but of his style, and a work that is, it must be said, perhaps the most vulnerable to that kind of criticism.

161
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This is not an arbitrary critique.

162
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It flows out of an underlying charge that the failures in Nietzsche's style, wherever they arise on Zarathustra, wherever he becomes excessive, whenever he's yelling too loudly, right?

163
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That comes directly out of his failure to fully integrate himself and his personality.

164
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There's a real psychopathology going on that forced Nietzsche to force the issue.

165
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But we're going to continue a little further with this seminar, because after this, the discussion turns to the use of Christian language and symbolism within thus books Zarathustra.

166
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And Jung levies the charge that we've considered already, the use of Christian language and symbolism was necessary for Nietzsche precisely because of what Nietzsche felt he had lost in the death of God.

167
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Jung brings up that the parallel style to that of the Gospels was a conscious choice, and that therefore Nietzsche on some level knew that he was seeking for what could only be given by religion.

168
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What he'd only known before in the language of the Gospels.

169
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The conversation is quite extensive in analyzing Nietzsche, but the key point of discussion is that Jung sees Nietzsche as somebody carried away with the power of an archetypal force.

170
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Zarathustra is electric, he's full of passion, he's completely overwhelming for Nietzsche, who writes of himself as a kind of instrument at times.

171
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Nietzsche sees himself in the way that he writes about in the Zarathustra's prologue, mankind being a bridge and not a goal.

172
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Nietzsche himself is a bridge and not a goal.

173
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He himself is stretched between animal and overman.

174
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He sees his job as bringing forward something that will bear fruit in the far off future.

175
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
In the present, all we can do is sacrifice to it.

176
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:45,000
For Jung, these very ideas are tell-tale signs of inflation, that the personality is becoming dominated by a complex to which everything is being sacrificed.

177
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And so the result is that Nietzsche, in his actual life, becomes a solitary, lonely figure.

178
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
His real life suffers because of his philosophy.

179
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He's alienated from all around him, from his family, his religion, eventually from his friends, from the Wagner's, from his fellow academics.

180
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And he writes a philosophy which sets itself at odds with, quote, the herd, right?

181
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So why would Nietzsche so strongly set himself as the individual in this eternal struggle against the collective?

182
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Back to the seminar, and this is the part that contains the strange folktale that I referenced earlier.

183
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But they begin by analyzing one of the first scenes from the Spokes' Arthustra.

184
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So we'll get back to the folktale a bit.

185
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Back to the seminar, quote, Dr. Jung.

186
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, he is no longer in touch with the world.

187
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And that Christianity has left the world is exactly the reason why Zarathustra is born again.

188
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He must come back because the spirit he created and left behind him has evaporated.

189
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You see, that is a repetition of the very important psychological fact that when Christ died,

190
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
he left behind him, or promised, according to the dogma, the paraclete, the comforter, which is the spirit,

191
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
like the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost, that is the aftermath of the Christian revelation,

192
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the spirit left by the appearance of Christ on earth.

193
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
His appearance was like a bursting shell that leaves the spirit trailing after.

194
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It remains for a while and then slowly recedes into the background again, end quote.

195
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And so Jung then ties the paraclete, one of those names for the Holy Spirit, the comforter, the advisor, or the counselor,

196
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to the old man in the forest, the old priest, the old ascetic,

197
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that Zarathustra meets in the forest at the very beginning of Zarathustra's prologue.

198
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And so Jung then quotes from Nietzsche from the book Zarathustra,

199
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
quote, Go not to men but stay in the forest. Go rather to the animals.

200
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Why not be like me, a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?

201
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And what do with the saint in the forest? asked Zarathustra.

202
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The saint answered, I make hymns and sing them, and in making hymns I laugh and weep and mumble.

203
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Thus do I praise God, end quote.

204
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And Dr. Jung then continues in the seminar, quote,

205
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:24,000
While the old anchorite spirit is now receding, he makes a regression having understood that nothing was to be done with these human beings.

206
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He becomes quite skeptical and thinks it best to worship his God in nature,

207
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
to be a bear with bears and a bird with birds, to imitate the animal voices again, to sing as a bird would sing.

208
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So he is isolated in his wood, a sort of penchant paraclete, ompinchon at least.

209
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The new spirit is now a Christ, therefore the analogy of Zarathustra with Christ.

210
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He comes down from the mountains with new hopes, new expectations, and a new message to man,

211
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and he passes the old fellow, and the new message which the old man does not know of is that God is dead.

212
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You see to the anchorite God is active, he still believes that there is a God outside of him,

213
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
but Zarathustra is convinced that there is no God outside of him.

214
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
God is dead.

215
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Mrs. Bauman, it corresponds with the death of Pan 2000 years ago.

216
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Dr. Jung, exactly.

217
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
One reads in old Latin literature that 2000 years ago,

218
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the captain of a boat sailing from the Grecian Islands to Ostia, the harbor of Rome,

219
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
demanded an immediate interview with the emperor in order to report

220
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
a most remarkable event which had taken place when he was sailing through the archipelago.

221
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He had passed in the night an island where there was an extraordinary noise.

222
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He heard people shouting, Pan Magistos Ethnican.

223
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Pan the greatest is dead.

224
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Pan was the philosophic God of those days.

225
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Originally he had been a Latin local God of the fields in the woods,

226
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
a sort of midday demon with no philosophical or universal importance whatever.

227
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Only later, when they learned Greek, did they see that the name of the old Latin God Pan

228
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
was the same as the Greek word Pan, which means all the universe.

229
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So they had new ideas about their old Pan.

230
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He became the God of the world.

231
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Then about the second century AD, rumors spread that Pan the greatest was dead.

232
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Christianity had prevailed against him.

233
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The last conception of a nature God created by antiquity.

234
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And when the God is dead, it means the end of an epoch.

235
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Therefore the great emphasis laid upon that story.

236
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
In this chapter then we have watched the way in which the spirit of a whole historical epoch recedes,

237
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
disappears into nature and how at the same time it is renewed in a new figure with a new message.

238
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yet it is still the same old figure, the same spirit that taught mankind the difference between good and evil

239
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
is now informing us of the fact that there is no difference and that God is dead.

240
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think that's a powerful critique that Jung makes.

241
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
That God is dead, yes, because the death of God is a recurring event.

242
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And in a way, by pointing to the ever recurring nature of this event,

243
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Jung is approaching Nietzsche's own proclamation in a very Nietzschean way.

244
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's, even if we grant that this is a European event, a grand historical event,

245
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
of the belief in the Christian God becoming something unworthy of belief, this is nothing new.

246
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
No more than when Nietzsche laments the fall of the tragic worldview,

247
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
the death of that old empire of the mind governed by Apollo and Dionysus

248
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and the harsh tragedies and the life-affirming Olympians.

249
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That was the world that is last presided over by Pan,

250
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
the world of the Antica Morale, where the forces of nature were perceived as autonomous gods.

251
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Pan was simply yet another divinity laid in the grave.

252
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And for Jung, he tied this belief to the astrological ages.

253
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The notion that Christianity was the age of Pisces, the two fish,

254
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
this is the age in which God comes to reconcile with his wayward children, mankind.

255
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You know, the fish is the symbol of Jesus Christ, dating from the period of the early Christians.

256
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Before Christianity, however, the Greco-Roman period was the age of Aries, the ram.

257
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
This is a war-like age, an age governed by divinities that have the horns of sheep and goats and rams.

258
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And Aries quite literally is the name of one of the Greek gods, and he's a war god.

259
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But even before this, there's the age of Taurus, the bull.

260
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And what deities do we see as characteristic of the period of the early Bronze Age?

261
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Well, figures such as Inanna, Ishtar, Astarte, the bull of heaven,

262
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the pastoralist beginnings of civilization,

263
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
sort of governed by the imagery of cows and bulls, and fertility goddesses.

264
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We can set aside whatever metaphysical importance that someone might think to attribute to the turnings of the astrological epochs.

265
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But we might simply note on a more basic level, lots of gods and deities have come into being in the human psyche,

266
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and then fallen out of worship, and that these images of God all have their time,

267
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
but then recede into the background of consciousness.

268
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Those are the long list of deities that atheists will cite as the gods that every modern theist is an atheist in regard to.

269
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That's a common argument.

270
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But for Jung, that's no great argument for atheism.

271
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He would argue, yes, and yet the gods always return, don't they?

272
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The fact that there have been so many religions that people have been atheistic towards

273
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
might score you some debate points against an individual religion,

274
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
but it actually goes pretty far towards establishing the value of religion as such,

275
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
or at least that human being seemed condemned to this way of thinking,

276
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and that pointing to the fact that we are all becoming atheists in regard to the latest deity

277
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
is not at all indicative that we are about to enter an age of atheism as such.

278
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You can look at the deaths of all these past divine images in those two very different ways,

279
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
that either the divine is always dying or the divine is always being resurrected.

280
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And we cannot help but notice the central religious motif of Christianity,

281
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and indeed many world religions before Christianity, is that of death and resurrection.

282
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Perhaps no religion other than Christianity is better suited to take on the idea of their own God dying and then resurrecting.

283
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's based on the faith that their God came to earth, died, and then lived again.

284
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And so, in a sense, we can see Nietzsche's proclamation of the death of the Christian God

285
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,000
as a mirror image to those shrieks that were heard from that mysterious island 2,000 years ago.

286
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That pan is dead.

287
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But this, of course, raises a serious question.

288
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Considering that Nietzsche sought to revitalize the spirit of the Greek morality,

289
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
then it ought to be possible to revitalize the spirit of the Christian morality.

290
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
If the Christian God ever lived, it's because Pan is dead.

291
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And if Nietzsche thinks that Pan can live again, then certainly so could Jesus Christ.

292
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Nietzsche's insistence on the finality of the Christian God's death,

293
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
but his implicit desire to see Pan live again, is a huge contradiction in his approach to these ideas.

294
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But perhaps the more insightful observation, in my opinion,

295
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
aside from any specific criticism of Nietzsche's ideas that Jung may be making,

296
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
there's a rather straightforward underlying truth.

297
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
In the unconscious, God, religion, all the symbolism and sentiments of religion,

298
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
these remain.

299
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Humanity, European or otherwise, has not even come close to moving on from these religious symbols,

300
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
this entire religious way of thinking.

301
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Even Nietzsche himself, living in the darkness after God's assassination,

302
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
finds a kind of psychopomp in his characters Arthustra.

303
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He is the wise old man, the prophet of the ancient world,

304
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and what he comes to teach mankind are actually truths that mankind has already known since time immemorial.

305
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Arthustra teaches that this self is something larger than the ego.

306
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
He teaches that good and evil are relative and interdependent,

307
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:06,000
that one must be reconciled to even embrace their fate with an eye toward the eternality of their destiny.

308
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
These kinds of assertions have been the stuff of religious talk for thousands of years.

309
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Arthustra is a figure that comes from Nietzsche's unconscious,

310
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
returning him to the most religious of language and metaphor,

311
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and drawing him inexorably into the world of myth and religion.

312
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And so Jung's great rebuke to Nietzsche is that his fundamental assertion is that a return to the mythic

313
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,000
is precisely what we need as the curative of the excessive materialization and mechanization of reality.

314
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Even patients who are undergoing a completely secular form of self-transformation speak in such religious language about the experience.

315
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Jung argues that people use the language of,

316
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I return to myself, I could accept myself, I was reconciled to myself,

317
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and he says this is what we used to say by expressing I have made my peace with God,

318
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I've submitted myself to the will of God, I've surrendered my will to the plan of God, and so on and so forth.

319
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And so Jung sees the key application of religious thought primarily in the realm of psychology.

320
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
He sees how religion is the central anchoring structure reigning over the psyche.

321
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
One might suggest that it's quite possibly an innovation that we now speak of the self and not God,

322
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
in terms of all the statements that Jung reports his patients making.

323
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But Jung would say that's a distinction without a difference,

324
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
that unconsciously the ideal complete self that we seek is identical to the idea of God,

325
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and that in both cases we would be describing the same thing,

326
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and that we just can't, we have to acknowledge that fundamental truth,

327
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that religion seems to be an orienting force for the mind.

328
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It seems to have that psychological function, that seems to be the value of religion is psychological.

329
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But in spite of this need for a sort of religious order,

330
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
a kind of understanding of our place of existence, the meaning and purpose of existence,

331
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
which has always been the North Star of the human mind,

332
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
we have, through excessive scientism, now thought that such things can be done away with,

333
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and for Jung the proof that this is a bad idea is Nietzsche himself.

334
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
This is the man who went so far beyond the Christian metaphysics and morality,

335
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and yet was not by his inclination a positivist or an atheist.

336
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Jung says straight out, Nietzsche completely accepted the death of God

337
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and tried to see what we should do beyond that, but he himself was no atheist.

338
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Nietzsche feels the de-spiritualization of the world very strongly,

339
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and he experiences its effects before anyone else.

340
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The atheists in Nietzsche's own time are quite literally like the atheists in the marketplace

341
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
when the madman makes his declaration.

342
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They've become unaware of their religious framework by which the human mind is organized.

343
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
They don't believe themselves to be susceptible to it.

344
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
They think that their thought exists beyond it.

345
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Jung believes that the demystification of the world occurred gradually,

346
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and initially it was for quite a worthy purpose.

347
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The sciences are a worthy endeavor because the gaps of human knowledge

348
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
are always filled with projection, and such a world is a chaotic world

349
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
when your world becomes ruled by projection, so to speak,

350
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
when you're in a world you don't understand.

351
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Science has been our way of taming the world in that way.

352
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Science has become the new expression of the pre-existent order behind the chaos of life.

353
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Nietzsche himself was rather insightful to give this scientism its own wise old man,

354
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
its own magician, who is Socrates.

355
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The death of Socrates is another repeated motif in Nietzsche's writing,

356
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
which is particularly interesting in light of Jungian analysis.

357
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Socrates is the wise old king who represents the positivist worldview.

358
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
In many ways, he has as much of a modern problem for Nietzsche as he is an ancient Greek problem.

359
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
He inevitably must drink his poison as a form of martyrdom for the truth.

360
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Scientism is a kind of eternal religious project,

361
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
but one which never manages to become the final state of the soul

362
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
because when you totalize the value of scientism, it is deadly.

363
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So Jung in his essay, Psychology and Religion, writes the following,

364
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Consciousness can hardly exist in a state of complete projection.

365
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
At most, it would be a heap of emotions.

366
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Through the withdrawal of projections, conscious knowledge slowly developed.

367
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Science, curiously enough, began with the discovery of astronomical laws

368
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and hence with the withdrawal, so to speak, of the most distant projections.

369
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
This was the first stage in the de-spiritualization of the world.

370
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
One step followed another.

371
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Already in antiquity the gods were withdrawn from mountains and rivers, from trees and animals.

372
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Modern science has subtleized its projections to an almost unrecognizable degree,

373
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
but our ordinary life swarms with them.

374
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You can find them spread out in the newspapers, in books, rumors, and ordinary social gossip.

375
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
All gaps in our actual knowledge are still filled with projections.

376
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
End quote and further down Jung continues, quote,

377
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The materialistic error was probably unavoidable at first,

378
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
since the throne of God cannot be discovered among the galactical systems,

379
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
the inference was that God never existed.

380
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
The second unavoidable error is Psychologism.

381
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
If God is anything, he must be an illusion derived from certain motives,

382
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
from will to power, for instance, or from repressed sexuality.

383
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
These arguments are not new.

384
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Much the same thing was said by the Christian missionaries who overthrew the idols of heathen gods.

385
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But whereas the early missionaries were conscious of serving a new God by combating the old ones,

386
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
modern iconoclasts are unconscious of the one in whose name they are destroying old values.

387
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
End quote.

388
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So we should take note Jung brings up two of his predecessors in this passage, but not by name.

389
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Nietzsche and Freud, men who say that God is an illusion derived from certain motives.

390
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
One could read Nietzsche's on the old and new tablets and thus spoke Zarathustra,

391
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
which I'm almost certain is what Jung is thinking of here,

392
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
especially given that he references the smashing of old tablets a bit further in the paragraph,

393
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
which we'll get to in a moment.

394
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But importantly in that passage, Zarathustra tells us every people has had its sacred values,

395
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
all of which have been different and all of which have actually expressed the will to power of a people.

396
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
He says that they defined their sacred values by differentiating themselves from their neighbors,

397
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
seeking an altogether different form of the good than their neighbor sought for.

398
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That the many different gods therefore are imagistic expressions of a particular way of expressing power.

399
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And that therefore the idols of man don't refer to anything metaphysical,

400
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but are simply the representation of a psychological need.

401
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Freud's explanation is that we believe in God because of in so many words,

402
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
terror management theory from my own understanding.

403
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Freud basically thought that the root of God belief was prior to anything rational.

404
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's simply a way of dealing with an indifferent, uncaring existence.

405
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Nevertheless, Freud had quite a bit to say about God the Father

406
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and so far as God in the way that God is portrayed in our sort of cultural images

407
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the wise old man with the beard, that is somewhat indicative of an infantile regression

408
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
to a state where one wants to be cared for by daddy.

409
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So here, as with everything in Freud, there's an influence of one's psychosexual family dynamics

410
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that continually recreates the image of God the Father.

411
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
In the words of Christopher Hitchens, quote, Nietzsche said God is dead,

412
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Freud said God is dead, end quote.

413
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I've been waiting to quote that one for probably the whole podcast.

414
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But Jung calls this an error.

415
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
He calls it psychologism to reduce everything down to being merely psychology.

416
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That's not Jung's task. Jung's task is the opposite,

417
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,000
not to regard psychological phenomena as merely or simply or just.

418
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Whenever we insert those sorts of words, we're saying it's insignificant.

419
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Rather, Jung's task is to understand psychological phenomena as being as significant as our myths,

420
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:14,000
as significant as our religious ideas, to see some common essence to the disciplines of religion and psychology.

421
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So his criticism of both Freud and Nietzsche here as iconoclasts

422
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
is that they do not know or are not conscious of the new gods that they are serving

423
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
as they bring forth this anti-Christian age.

424
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Nietzsche might think I'm restoring Greek values, but is that what Nietzsche actually did?

425
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Is that what he's actually doing?

426
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Have we seen that effect in the collective psyche as a result of Nietzsche's work?

427
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Have Greek values been restored?

428
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So Jung continues, quote,

429
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Nietzsche thought himself quite conscious and responsible when he smashed the old tablets,

430
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,000
yet he felt a peculiar need to back himself up with a revivified Zerothustra, a sort of alter ego

431
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
with whom he often identifies himself in his great tragedy of the Spokes Zerothustra.

432
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Nietzsche was no atheist, but his god was dead.

433
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The result of this demise was a split in himself,

434
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
to call the other self Zerothustra, or at times Dionysus.

435
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
In his fatal illness, he signed his letters Zegreus, the dismembered god of the Thracians.

436
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The tragedy of Zerothustra is that because his god died, Nietzsche himself became a god,

437
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and this happened because he was no atheist.

438
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He was of too positive a nature to tolerate the urban neurosis of atheism.

439
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It seems dangerous for such a man to assert that god is dead.

440
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
He instantly becomes the victim of inflation.

441
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Far from being a negation, god is actually the strongest and most effective position the psyche can reach,

442
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
in exactly the same sense in which Paul speaks of the people whose god is in their belly, end quote.

443
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So, you know, this is why I love Jung's criticism of Nietzsche, perhaps most of all.

444
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You can poke all sorts of logical holes in it,

445
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and accuse Jung of stating things with certainty that are basically just speculation, and that would be true.

446
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But Nietzsche philosophized and made critiques, and stated his own speculations with certainty in sort of the same way.

447
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So, how can we really defend Nietzsche on that basis?

448
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Like, you're not making the most rigorous argument.

449
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I mean, go look at a lot of the way Nietzsche attacks and polemicizes against past philosophical figures by psychoanalyzing them.

450
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And Jung is mostly taking the same mode of attack here, so it's kind of hard, you know, turn about his fair play, is what I'm trying to say.

451
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But what I love about Jung's comments here is that he's complimenting Nietzsche in the highest terms, and also basically calling him crazy.

452
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
That Nietzsche is not like the simple-minded variety of atheists that came after him.

453
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It really, he's not an atheist at all, not by temperament, and not in practice,

454
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
as he is forced by a God inhabiting him to construct a new religion, to author in a new religious language.

455
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And this new God, he feels to be something he himself created.

456
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And that's, in some sense, the source of the inflation, the idea that a God is inside of him.

457
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
He feels himself to be more of a prophet than a philosopher,

458
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
the man who must make the most serious demands that have ever been made of mankind.

459
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's the way he classifies his project in Achehomo.

460
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
God actually is in Nietzsche's belly, both in the sense that he carries the spirit of Zarathustra,

461
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:45,000
and that he relocates the pre-rational intelligence governing our very being to the physiology quite literally to the belly, right?

462
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Think about all the comments Nietzsche says about the importance of diet in terms of what your ideas are going to be.

463
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But as Jung points out here, Nietzsche himself feels torn.

464
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
He signs his letters as Dionysus, or as Agraeus, who is Dionysus in his dismembered form.

465
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's surprising that Jung doesn't mention in this passage that Nietzsche signed his letters as the crucified, although I think Jung mentions it elsewhere.

466
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But it indicates that even for Nietzsche, the pole of that opposite moral orientation that other archetype still exists,

467
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:30,000
that Nietzsche felt himself not wholly Dionysian, but divided between the two, which is a similar critique that Gerard makes.

468
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What the Christian represents to Jung is far more than Nietzsche's conception of the Christian.

469
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
To Nietzsche Christianity is first and foremost a moral framework.

470
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's a system of reacting against the powerful, driven by an inborn pity.

471
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's fueled by resentment, and it deals with resentment by creating the bad conscience within the individual.

472
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Its existence therefore becomes a delivery system for pity, which results ultimately in a mankind which lives in a state of guilt.

473
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,000
For Jung, Christianity has to be understood as a religion centered around the life of Christ.

474
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Christ, like Dionysus, or Zarathustra, is an archetype.

475
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We could say that Christ is the most powerful archetype in all of human history, even.

476
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And just as we might consciously disavow the religious, while our unconscious goes right along thinking in religious terms,

477
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
we can consciously criticize the Christian moral feeling, as Nietzsche did.

478
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
But all the while still find our thoughts and actions motivated or affected by the imagery and the narrative,

479
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
the pre-rational sensibility that Christianity represents.

480
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Jung writes in Psychology and Religion, quote,

481
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The life of Christ is no exception in that not a few of the great figures of history have realized more or less clearly the archetype of the hero's life,

482
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
with its characteristic changes of fortune.

483
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
But the ordinary man too unconsciously lives archetypal forms, and if these are no longer valued,

484
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
it is only because of the prevailing psychological ignorance.

485
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Indeed, even the fleeting phenomena of dreams often reveal distinctly archetypal patterns.

486
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
At bottom, all psychic events are so deeply grounded in the archetype and are so much interwoven with it

487
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
that in every case, considerable critical effort is needed to separate the unique from the typical with any certainty.

488
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Ultimately, every individual is continuously historical because strictly time bound.

489
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The relation of the type to time, on the other hand, is irrelevant.

490
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Since the life of Christ is archetypal to a high degree, it represents to just that degree the life of the archetype.

491
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But since the archetype is the unconscious precondition of every human life,

492
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
its life, when revealed, also reveals the hidden unconscious ground life of every individual.

493
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
That is to say what happens in the life of Christ happens always and everywhere.

494
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,000
In the Christian archetype, all lives of this kind are prefigured and are expressed over and over again, or once and for all.

495
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And in it too, the question that concerns us here of God's death is anticipated in perfect form.

496
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Christ himself is the typical dying and self-transforming God.

497
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
The psychological situation from which we started is tantamount to,

498
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here.

499
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Luke 24-5.

500
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
But where shall we find the risen Christ?

501
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
End quote.

502
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
So another striking disagreement between Nietzsche and Jung.

503
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Jung calls Jesus the perfected archetype of the hero.

504
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Nietzsche completely disagrees with this, and he mentions in his book The Antichrist,

505
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,000
that much of his comments against Jesus as the heroic figure are a polemic against Renan's view of Jesus,

506
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
who was also put forward the notion that Jesus perfects the heroic type.

507
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Nietzsche thinks there's no one further from a hero than Jesus of Nazareth.

508
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And we could say that this position comes out of Nietzsche's perception,

509
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
that there are two different competing types of aristocracy in human society.

510
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Two centers of power that emerged since ancient days.

511
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Warrior aristocracies and the priestly castes.

512
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The aristocracies attain the ability to create values by fighting for worldly power.

513
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The priestly castes create values via the ascetic ideal,

514
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
which essentially involves not fighting, not struggling to attain worldly power,

515
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
eschewing worldly power.

516
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Nietzsche sees an essential difference here and sees Jesus as sort of like an ultimate ascetic.

517
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It can't even be classed among the heroes such as Gilgamesh or Hercules.

518
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Those are symbols of vital fighting, struggling life.

519
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Jesus is defined by not struggling against the powers that be.

520
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
He gives no worldly resistance at all.

521
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
He teaches his followers to turn the other cheek, resist not evil.

522
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Nietzsche says those three words, resist not evil, are the key to the entire gospel.

523
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Jung sees things differently.

524
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Precisely insofar as the archetype itself of the self-sacrificing individual speaking truth to power

525
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
is a form of struggle.

526
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The way of life of Jesus, the image of life that Jesus gives us,

527
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
it's a form that recognizes that it is not by worldly competition,

528
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
by strife or violence, in the manner that Cain killed Abel,

529
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
that power itself can be opposed.

530
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The most famous example of what we might call Christian heroism,

531
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
overcoming the old morality, the antiche moral,

532
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
is the story of the last gladiatorial games.

533
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Two gladiators are about to do battle in the arena.

534
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
A Christian walks down into the arena, tells them to stop in the name of Christ.

535
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
They killed him, but the audience walks out in protest.

536
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It's the end of this spectacle of public collective violence.

537
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Through martyrdom, through a loving, sincere, nonviolent will,

538
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
one can put themselves into opposition with power itself

539
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and be a more effective threat to it than all of the violent revolutionaries that have ever existed throughout history.

540
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Because violent revolution only ever creates more violence, a harsher crackdown.

541
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Whenever it succeeds, it almost always becomes the tyranny it opposed

542
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and whenever it fails, it only ever brings about a harsher response from the powers that be.

543
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So it seems that the only way to actually oppose the corruption of power

544
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
is not to resist it in physical terms, but to resist it spiritually, to condemn it morally.

545
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And so for Jung, the life of Christ is a heroic life.

546
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
This is a man who lives by his principles and suffers supremely for it.

547
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But he does so as a personal sacrifice for the greater good of mankind.

548
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
What is that if not heroic?

549
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The heroic archetype and the language of all religions and cultures is related to the symbol of the self.

550
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The hero is the protagonist, so to speak.

551
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Jung writes in the chapter of Aion, Christ, a symbol of the self,

552
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,000
quote, Christ is our nearest analogy of the self and its meaning, end quote.

553
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,000
This cross-cultural idea of a heroic self is always found in relation to the savior archetype,

554
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
or the redeemer, as Jung calls it.

555
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's a timeless experience that in a period of chaos in which God seems to have vanished,

556
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
it's at that moment that we begin to search for the savior.

557
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And in terms of personal psychological development, this is exemplified in the practice of giving oneself over to a higher power,

558
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
as an effective means of personal transformation.

559
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Christ, as the hero who is born, lives, and dies as God on earth,

560
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:25,000
it's a God image and ideal that man can and will hold on to whenever God seems to be absent.

561
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It's the message that the savior will always return.

562
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And since his life is so archetypal and thus eternal and universal,

563
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
we can find endless inspiration and comfort in the example of the life of Christ.

564
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Further, in the essay Psychology and Religion, Jung continues, quote,

565
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
The death or loss must always repeat itself.

566
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Christ always dies and always he is born.

567
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
For the psychic life of the archetype is timeless in comparison with our individual time-boundness.

568
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,000
According to what laws now one and now another aspect of the archetype enters into active manifestations, I do not know.

569
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I only know, and here I am expressing, what countless other people know,

570
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
that the present is a time of God's death and disappearance.

571
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
The myth says that he was not to be found where his body was laid.

572
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Body means the outward visible form, the erstwhile but ephemeral setting for the highest value.

573
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The myth further says that the value rose again in a miraculous manner, transformed.

574
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It appears as a miracle.

575
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
For when a value disappears, it always seems to be lost irretrievably.

576
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So it is quite unexpected that it should come back.

577
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The three days descent into hell during death describes the sinking of the vanished value into the unconscious,

578
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
whereby conquering the power of darkness it establishes a new order and then rises up to heaven again.

579
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That is, attains supreme clarity of consciousness.

580
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:09,000
The fact that only a few people see the risen one means that no small difficulties stand in the way of finding and recognizing the transformed value.

581
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
End quote.

582
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,000
From this, it may be difficult to say exactly what Jung really believes about Jesus Christ.

583
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Was he a literal God on earth who physically resurrected?

584
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Or is it just that the psychological truth of the story is so powerful and so eternally real to us for all intents and purposes?

585
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Such questions of the material reality of the story cannot be taken seriously.

586
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And you could say that this kind of confusion, what do you really believe about this story,

587
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:51,000
applies to some prominent Jungians in the light of the public eye today.

588
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It's real for us psychologically, and so such questions of the material reality of the resurrection are merely academic.

589
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That might be the Jungian response.

590
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I understand it. I think for me personally it's a bit unsatisfying.

591
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:16,000
But all the same, there are moments in this passage where it seems as though Christ is being used as a metaphor for personal development.

592
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And I'm sure that Dr. Jung would insist that, sure, it is a metaphor.

593
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's not just a metaphor, right?

594
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That we really need to get over that kind of productive thinking.

595
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And I'd agree with him to some extent there too.

596
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But I suppose that I've never been satisfied by such reasoning.

597
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
To put my issues with it into words that might be commensurate with Jung's own thought,

598
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:49,000
if the sciences have de-spiritualized the world to the point that people no longer consciously accept mythic explanations,

599
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
then shouldn't we have to reconcile ourselves to this reality

600
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
rather than attempting to reconcile our conscious sober understanding of reality?

601
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
The one that's banished all those projections, right?

602
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
That Jung says is just chaos.

603
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Now that we're living in a more conscious sober understanding,

604
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
should we reconcile that reality to the world of dreams and schizophrenic visions?

605
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Or should we reconcile the world of dreams and schizophrenic visions to the more sober view of life?

606
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
The fact that we habitually think in certain terms does not preclude the possibility that these are still incorrect terms.

607
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And I would say that's one of the main great critiques of Nietzsche, right?

608
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That we have these thought habits that are ultimately erroneous.

609
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And even if we can't escape certain pitfalls of thought,

610
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
does that mean we should make a decision to become irrational to forget what we've learned?

611
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Or do we say perhaps I will begin to measure the strength of my soul by how much truth I can tolerate?

612
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That's all an open question.

613
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Perhaps Dr. Jung could point out the ways in which someone like myself has gone along with the fantastical views of a man like Nietzsche,

614
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
who was undoubtedly driven by a kind of prophetic inspiration,

615
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and that therefore, even my own way of life is proof, we all must choose our religion,

616
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and to follow in the footsteps of Nietzsche is no less another choice of religious affiliation.

617
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And as a consequence of Nietzsche's inflation with that Zarathustrian archetype by becoming Zarathustra's prophet,

618
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
and Nietzsche's attempt to force certain anti-Christian sentiments or strange moral ideas into existence

619
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
that Jung thinks even he couldn't fully believe,

620
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Jung alleges in an infamous section of memories, dreams, and reflections that Nietzsche fell into unreality.

621
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
quote

622
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Nietzsche had lost the ground under his feet because he possessed nothing more than the inner world of his thoughts,

623
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
which incidentally possessed him more than he it.

624
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:04,000
He was uprooted and hovered above the earth, and therefore he succumbed to exaggeration and irreality.

625
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
For me, such irreality was the quintessence of horror,

626
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
for I aimed, after all, at this world and this life.

627
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
end quote

628
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
You know, it's the brilliant thing about Jung's critiques because the precise thing Nietzsche would say

629
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
is that they aim at this world and this life.

630
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
The affirmation of this world and this life is the very thing that Nietzsche said as his goal.

631
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But a Jungian would counter, is that what his philosophy actually resulted in?

632
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
What was the actual operative process going on in Nietzsche's thought?

633
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Was it actually being grounded in the material reality around him?

634
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Jung would say no.

635
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
For one, Nietzsche did not live up to that very ideal that he set for himself.

636
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Why not?

637
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Well, by the very fact that he set himself against the entire modern world,

638
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Nietzsche is keen to understand our existence as an indelibly human existence,

639
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and yet he thinks that the human psyche, as it is, is fundamentally sick and deluded.

640
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
He smashes the tablets of old.

641
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
He engages in that iconoclasm for which Jung criticizes him.

642
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
He tries to destroy all that, which we formerly regarded as real.

643
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But he does so while being driven by forces that he admits he doesn't fully understand.

644
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And he knows that he's showing signs of incipient madness.

645
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,000
So I think there is at least something to Jung's critique here of Nietzsche.

646
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
There's a passage in volume 7 of Jung's collected works that clarifies this.

647
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
This is on page 37.

648
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
We must look very critically at the life of one who taught such a yeh saying

649
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
in order to examine the views of this teaching on the teacher's own life.

650
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,000
When we scrutinize his life with this aim and view, we are bound to admit that Nietzsche lived beyond instinct

651
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
and the lofty heights of heroic sublimity,

652
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
heights that he could maintain only with the help of the most meticulous diet,

653
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
a carefully selected climate, and many aids to sleep, until the tension shattered his brain.

654
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
He talked of yeh saying and lived the nay.

655
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
His loathing for man, for the human animal that lived by instinct, was too great.

656
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Despite everything, he could not swallow the toad he so often dreamed of,

657
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
and what he feared had to be swallowed.

658
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
The roaring of the Zarathustrian lion drove back into the cavern of the unconscious

659
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
all the higher men who were clamoring to live.

660
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Hence, his life does not convince us of his teaching.

661
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
For the higher man wants to be able to sleep without chloral,

662
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
to live in Nomburg and Basel despite fogs and shadows.

663
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
He desires wife and offspring, standing in a steam among the herd,

664
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
innumerable commonplace realities, and not least those of the Philistine.

665
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Nietzsche failed to live this instinct, the animal urged to life.

666
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
For all his greatness and importance, Nietzsche's was a pathological personality.

667
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
End quote.

668
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
So as we all know in Nietzsche's biography,

669
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,000
as Jung says, he fails to ever find a wife or start a family,

670
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
which does seem to be something he was interested in,

671
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
in spite of the ways that he disparaged married philosophers,

672
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and at least one passage I can think of,

673
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:40,000
which could come off like sour grapes in that old fable of Aesop.

674
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And what happened to Nietzsche?

675
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
He began to steadily detach from reality itself.

676
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
His mind began to become consumed by these warring forces,

677
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Dionysus versus the Crucified.

678
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
He eventually has his collapse and becomes an invalid,

679
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
muttering insane phrases and living in a hazy world of hallucinations.

680
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So Nietzsche and Kant accuse a Jungian of not wanting to live in reality,

681
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and a Jungian can say, well, Nietzsche didn't live in reality.

682
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He quite literally went insane.

683
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So was the Nietzschean philosophy really a good approximation of reality,

684
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
or was his iconoclasm something ill-advised,

685
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
something which actually did not achieve its aim of destroying the old religious power,

686
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
it in fact destroyed Nietzsche.

687
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And in writing his philosophy, Nietzsche opened the floodgates

688
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
for all sorts of older, dangerous spiritual forces to take hold.

689
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And the Nietzschean might counter that by saying,

690
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
well, is that a material claim or a metaphor to which the Jungian might say both,

691
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and on and on and on.

692
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Still, we should keep in mind that Nietzsche was an important influence on Jung,

693
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and Nietzsche as a case study was invaluable to Jung.

694
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I mean, the very fact that Nietzsche is a case that Jung returns to

695
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
again and again throughout his work proves this.

696
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
The case of Nietzsche is perhaps one of the greatest psychological events that has ever happened

697
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
from a Jungian perspective.

698
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,000
How could you be anything but grateful that you have a work like The Spook Zarathustra,

699
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:23,000
which is a living record of archetypal inflation on a scale that has perhaps never been seen before since.

700
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Jung was influenced by the Gnostics and by the Alchemists.

701
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And while a discussion of Jung's views on alchemy is something I'm certainly going to cover in the future,

702
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
it would take us way too far afield here,

703
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,000
but I just wanted to mention Jung's interest in esotericism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism,

704
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
alchemy, Theosophy, magic, astrology, divination.

705
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The fact that Jung was interested in these things is often added to the list of reasons why Jung is a kook or something like that.

706
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
But in truth, his method here is quite consistent with his method generally,

707
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
and it's seen in the way he looks at Nietzsche.

708
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
He looks at Nietzsche as frankly insane.

709
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But what Jung does is he looks to these domains of human thought with the aim of gathering truth about the human mind,

710
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
which is undoubtedly where all these ideas emerge.

711
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
It's where they exist, right?

712
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Whatever you want to say about an idea, you know it comes from the mind, so it tells you something about the mind.

713
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So Jung doesn't start from the position that astrology reveals truths about material physical reality.

714
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,000
He starts from the position that astrology is the projection of the contents of our unconscious onto the stars.

715
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It comes from the intuition that the turning of celestial bodies is somehow involved with the destiny of mankind

716
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
in some strange, distant way that's perhaps larger than we can even perceive.

717
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And so there's like an intuition that the cycles of life here on Earth are governed by the stars.

718
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And that idea when we stated in that very general sense is true, by the way.

719
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,000
But that's not why Jung studies it, is not to, you know, to read horoscopes.

720
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
The work of the alchemists is much the same.

721
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The alchemists believed, as above so below, the laws that govern heaven are the laws that govern matter.

722
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Whatever apprehends in the domain of spirit ought to apply in the domain of science.

723
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And so the magnum opus, the name for the great work of the alchemists, is not simply a charlatan's promise of turning lead into gold.

724
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's something much bigger than that.

725
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It's the notion that we could transform one type of substance into another type.

726
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:46,000
That the elements that we perceive in the world are all related to one another as matter, as something physical.

727
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And just as the spiritual world, you know, we speak of the language of change and transformation as the main spiritual narrative.

728
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Perhaps we can learn the corresponding laws that apprehend here on Earth so that we could use scientific knowledge to affect change or transformation among material forms.

729
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:13,000
That, you know, different types of matter, different forms of matter as we perceive them aren't actually like fundamentally different.

730
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That they all have a unity to them as matter and that, you know, and again, that's something that is actually true, right?

731
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Maybe you could say they didn't know that empirically or experimentally, but this is the insight of going all the way back to Democritus.

732
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Matter is united to other forms of matter as matter and that they all behave by the laws of matter.

733
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:48,000
If they're all made of atoms and these configurations of elementary particles, then yes, we find out in the modern day when we have a particle accelerator that we can actually turn lead into gold, right?

734
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
The atoms that make up lead and the atoms that make up gold are the same atoms, right?

735
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
No, they're not actually literally the same atoms.

736
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You know what I'm saying. They're all made up of the same subatomic particles.

737
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And, you know, alchemy was the basis of chemistry and that's to oversimplify things.

738
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
You know, in truth, alchemy was practiced concurrently with chemistry for a very long time.

739
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:25,000
This is sort of like an esoteric form of chemistry where a lot of the results are kept secret or preserved in the form of code because they wanted to keep the unwise from learning about these chemical changes and secrets.

740
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,000
But, you know, the alchemists did in fact make discoveries that were relevant to early chemistry.

741
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
They discovered phosphorus.

742
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
They learned develop techniques that we use to this day and distilling, creating alcohol.

743
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
The word alcohol comes from alchemy, but that's not Jung's interest.

744
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Where he finds his interest in the alchemists is insofar as they write of the esoteric work of self-transformation,

745
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:00,000
where they use the metaphors of the chemical transformations they're able to affect.

746
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
They find a correspondence there to the world of the spirit, as above so below.

747
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
So moving from lead to tin to iron to copper to mercury to silver to gold,

748
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
that's a kind of metaphor for the soul and its own path of transformation.

749
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And so the material that the alchemists leave behind, the textual record that we have today of alchemy,

750
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
has a psychologically relevant dimension because oftentimes they're using the chemical processes they've discovered

751
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
and mixing it together with religious imagery and symbolism in order to try to convey a metaphor of spiritual development.

752
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And Jung is perhaps the first person to perceive this.

753
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Alchemy is a psychologically relevant field of study.

754
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Furthermore, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, all these esoteric religious movements,

755
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
these are also psychologically valuable fields of study.

756
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:02,000
What Jung finds so valuable in these traditions, we might say, is that it's an artistic expression of religious thought.

757
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:11,000
In other words, it's written by people who are letting their creative metaphor-making side of the mind run free, so to speak.

758
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
They're giving voice to the most significant and numinous concepts in their minds,

759
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:23,000
which we might say within traditional dogmatic religion is circumscribed within a set of traditional symbols.

760
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
You're not really allowed to be creative or you're not supposed to be creative with the symbols and imagery within the tradition of the religion.

761
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Jung writes quite a bit about mandalas as a result of this, those eastern symbols of spiritual wholeness.

762
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:48,000
A mandala has a circular shape. It bears resemblance to the kind of paradisaical walled garden that indicates a fully actualized self.

763
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Jung's patients would draw mandalas as part of their process of psychological convalescence, sort of spontaneously expressing they were moving toward the state of wholeness.

764
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And in the mandalas, drawn by his patients, Jung basically saw it as though their artistic faculties were being used to sort of channel that language of spirituality.

765
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And it's the same with an alchemical text or a gnostic text.

766
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And then furthermore, Jung finds examples in literature in which a work that might normally be considered secular has a deep religious dimension.

767
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And a work we've considered throughout the episode is Zorathustra, but another main source of influence is Goethe's Faust, particularly Faust II.

768
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And one of the things that Jung sees in these works of apparently secular fiction is that often they use alchemical imagery or symbolism.

769
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Which again, isn't because Jung thinks there's like a secret influence from the alchemists there, although there certainly might be in some cases.

770
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,000
But that the thing underlying that use of imagery is, we might say, prior to alchemy and prior to the text.

771
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:08,000
The reason why it resonates with us is because it's something that there is a grain of psychological truth within these gnostic traditions.

772
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I'm going to quote now from Paul Bishop's, the Dionysian self, Carl Jung's reception of Friedrich Nietzsche.

773
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Jung's study of gnostic literature is also important because together with his own personal experiences, it led him to an entirely new understanding of Goethe's Faust and Nietzsche's Zorathustra.

774
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:41,000
According to his autobiography, Jung concluded that he could resituate both these works within the matrix of the mythopoeic imagination, which in his view had disappeared in the modern age of rationality.

775
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Both Faust and Zorathustra could be subsumed in the golden or Homeric chain, the alchemical term for the series of great wise men, starting with Hermes Trismegestus, which links heaven and earth.

776
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:04,000
End quote, and then he quotes from Jung here, quote, the second part of Faust, too, is more than a literary exercise.

777
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It is a link in the aria catena, which has existed from the beginnings of philosophical alchemy and gnosticism down to Nietzsche's Zorathustra.

778
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Unpopular, ambiguous, and dangerous, it is a voyage of discovery to the other pole of the world.

779
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
End quote.

780
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And so that's the value of Nietzsche as a case study.

781
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:38,000
He presents us with a journey through his own psyche to a pole of reality that is far flung from our normal, everyday conscious experience.

782
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Both Goethe and Nietzsche accomplished this because their works consciously or unconsciously drew from the well of religious and alchemical symbolism.

783
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Both are engaged with the Aries era religion of Greek antiquity and with the Pisces era religion of European Christendom.

784
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And both Goethe and Nietzsche are in their way heralds of a new kind of modern man, a man who has to live in this de-spiritualized reality,

785
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:18,000
who thinks in terms of mechanistic explanations and positivistic empiricism, and yet beneath the surface there's that same archetypal drama.

786
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Those archetypes still reach up and take hold of the human heart.

787
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
They are still the driving sub complexes that determine our fate.

788
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:33,000
In dreams, as in our most desperate moments, we still think in those same terms.

789
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Like Faust, when we reach the end of all of our studies of the physical world, all of the knowledge and the art and science of mankind,

790
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:49,000
we sigh aloud and say, quote, and here I am for all my lore, the wretched fool I was before, end quote.

791
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And in our heart we wonder, as Faust does, what is that secret force? What is it that hides behind the world?

792
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And so Jung reads Faust like a gnostic text, and he reads Zarathustra like a gnostic text.

793
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:14,000
He asks what the psychological relevance is, what is their timeless truth that stands prior to the author's conscious reasons, which are really just post hoc.

794
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:25,000
The conflict that is the main undercurrent of both of these works and the malady that split Nietzsche in half is described by Jung in the essay The Undiscovered Self, quote.

795
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Nothing is more characteristic and symptomatic than the gulf that is opened out between faith and knowledge.

796
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:40,000
The rupture between faith and knowledge is a symptom of the split consciousness which is so characteristic of the mental disorder of our day.

797
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It is as if two different persons were making statements about the same thing, each from his own point of view, or as if one person in two different frames of mind were sketching a picture of his experience, end quote.

798
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
The conflict, as it were, is between our conscious and unconscious.

799
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Consciously we're guided by knowledge, unconsciously by faith.

800
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:13,000
We ignore the unconscious side because it contains the shadow, among other things, all of that we have tried to suppress about ourselves.

801
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
The unconscious remains a fearful place, a place from which the individual always tries to look away or flee.

802
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And that only means that the unconscious contents will remain ever more dangerous.

803
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,000
They're already ready to take hold and subsume the individual in moments of crisis or great social upheaval.

804
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Nowadays in the modern age that we've lost our religious lexicon for talking about them, that's why they take on a greater danger.

805
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And those political isms, communism, fascism, for example, those are the work of archetypal thoughts.

806
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Archetypal feelings, archetypal actions, taking hold of a mass of individuals that have become disintegrated.

807
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Jung stresses that there is a real peril here, therefore, in continuing to ignore the unconscious or assuming that we could iconoclastically smash the contents of it.

808
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
We will always find our destiny is made there and not authored by the ego.

809
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And on that respect, Jung and Nietzsche are in agreement.

810
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
But Jung would argue that Nietzsche was one-sided.

811
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,000
He was brilliant, he was deeply in touch with himself, and he wrote some of the most beautiful passages in the history of literature.

812
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:39,000
But nevertheless, he was the victim of archetypal inflation, a one-sided man who followed the will to truth under the harshest, coldest territory that its extremities could offer

813
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,000
and found that in that vast cold darkness an archetype was waiting for him.

814
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:59,000
The archetype of the wise old man that returned only more powerfully because Nietzsche had tried to make war upon that very thing, the anchoring meaning behind our society.

815
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Jung writes, quote,

816
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And therefore he sought a higher human wholeness beyond good and evil.

817
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But he who seriously criticizes the basic attitudes of Christianity also forfeits the protection which these bestow upon him.

818
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
He delivers himself up unresistingly to the animal psyche.

819
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:44,000
That is the moment of Dionysian frenzy, the overwhelming manifestation of the blonde beast, which seizes the unsuspecting soul with nameless shudderings.

820
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:51,000
The seizure transforms him into a hero or into a godlike being, a superhuman entity.

821
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,000
He rightly feels himself 6,000 feet beyond good and evil, end quote.

822
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Jung's way of approaching other thinkers from this psychoanalytic angle is as powerful an interpretive framework as anything Nietzsche himself gives us.

823
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Jung finds that there's much truth in what is hidden, invisible, unsaid, or even unable to be said.

824
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And the metaphor that Jung uses for this made it so I couldn't resist quoting him, and I think the Delusians will enjoy this quote that we're going to end on.

825
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
This is from Memories, Dreams, and Reflections, quote,

826
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Thank you for joining me and examining Nietzsche through the Jungian lens.

827
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I feel that now that we've introduced Jung into our rogue's gallery of thinkers, I can now include more of Jung as we continue on.

828
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And I intend to do that with many of the figures we've discussed so far.

829
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I usually try to introduce a new philosopher with the most wholesome possible introduction that is to say an introduction that conveys the whole person, also offering some concrete ideas from specific works,

830
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
and in a way which is as steel manned as I'm capable of doing.

831
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And secondly, because of the topic of the podcast, I feel obligated to explain their relation to Nietzsche as sort of the task number one in bringing up a new figure.

832
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And so once we get both of those steps out of the way, I feel that I have more freedom in future episodes to return to that figure without having to constantly tie it back to Nietzsche.

833
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:58,000
And since we've now gotten a lot of Nietzsche's main influences introduced, I've talked about a handful of interpreters, the podcast, I think as we go forward, it's going to continue to shift its focus, so to speak.

834
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
More and more episodes will be about people who aren't Nietzsche.

835
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:16,000
But personally, I'm looking forward to this, because it's not as if I'm not going to talk about Nietzsche anymore, but there's just so much other great philosophy work out there to talk about, and I like the variety.

836
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I hope all of you do as well. I'd expect next season we're going to probably have more episodes than not, which are not Nietzsche-centric, so to speak.

837
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:38,000
But again, this is still the Nietzsche podcast, which means that in our next main episode, we're going to get back into Nietzsche's work, and we're going to continue with that theme of psychological investigation.

838
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:45,000
We're going to consider one of the most important psychological passages in Nietzsche from Twilight of Idols, The Four Great Errors.

839
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I've referenced it before. I think it's time to give it a proper episode all to itself.

840
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Before we get there, though, I have another conversation coming next week. This one I'm very excited about as well.

841
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So hopefully all of you will join me then for a conversation. It's going to be sort of a counterpart to the one I did with Devon Gorey.

842
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,000
We're getting political again, but I think it was a great conversation. I think you're going to enjoy it.

843
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So tune in next week. By the time this episode's coming out, I'm going to be on tour. I'm going to be on the road.

844
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So look me up. See if I'm going to be in your city. If you're not going to be a weirdo, then please come out and come see me.

845
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I say that, but I haven't had anywhere. I've had lots of fans of the podcast come out to shows. They've all been great.

846
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
You just get weirded out saying things like that online.

847
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:48,000
All right, everybody, that's going to be it for this week. Hope you'll join me next time. Cheers, everybody, signing off.

848
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Thank you.
