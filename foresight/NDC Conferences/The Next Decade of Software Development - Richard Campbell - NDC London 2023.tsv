0	6920	I found out like yesterday afternoon that I had to do this talk, so I was preparing so I didn't get a chance to see the keynote
6920	13360	I look forward to watching the video of it. Hi, my name is Richard Campbell. I am an old geek. I've been doing this stuff for a long time
13360	14760	I'm for British Columbia
14760	21440	This is a picture of my house on the left and my neighbor's house on the right. We call this the animal highway
21440	26480	I didn't realize until I put this camera in that we get bears every week
27480	30760	It's this is about six in the morning in the summertime
31480	34920	On a Wednesday because Wednesday in my neighborhood is garbage day
35400	38720	So he's just coming to see if I put out my garbage early or not
39720	44920	And there are consequences if I do so and actually we get fine if we put out the garbage early
44920	48640	It's quite against the rules, but it that's what it's like living British Columbia
48640	49720	It's just forest behind me
49720	53480	It's like a big old buffet for bears and they come through and check on it
53480	57920	He sees actually at the at the top of the driveway right now surveying his domain
58160	60320	Anybody got the garbage out before he moves on I
61080	63720	Make a lot of podcasts any done at rocks listeners
64480	67880	Awesome Carl's not here. I won't be recording it out in a rocks this week
67880	74960	I'm gonna be doing some run as Carl started down at rocks back in 2002 which predates the word podcast by a couple of years
74960	82720	I came on board with show 100 in 2005 where it 18 will do 18 30 this week
83480	85640	It's already in the can and this
87160	91240	And yeah, a lot of the stuff that I do is based on down to rocks this talk definitely is
91760	95240	Coming from all these interviews we get to do we get to talk to really smart people
95240	100840	And so you get to decide to synthesize the sort of vision of what's going on. I do an IT show as well
101480	105400	Call run as radio and I think a episode 863 went up today
105400	110760	And for a brief period between 2011 and 2014 we made a show called the tablet show
111520	116720	Back when we didn't know what to do about tablets and now we know tablet development. It's just development. It's not a big deal
117360	119400	All right, so we're gonna do a little future prediction
119400	125720	So let's refer to Niels Bohr's prediction is very difficult, especially about the future although. I don't know what else you would predict
127280	134600	So let's go through the obvious things that are happening today that are gonna shape the way we build software for the next few years
134600	139720	I wrote the first version is talking 2019 thinking one of the 2020 is gonna be like and now it's 2023
139760	142320	And it's not exactly what I thought but
142920	146360	Did anybody plan up for a pandemic in 2019? I don't think so
146840	151040	But obviously the cloud has come to dominate in the past few years. It was true
151200	154360	It was less true in 2018 2019
154360	159520	But today if you don't have a cloud plan you kind of don't have a plan your your employer is probably gonna ask you
159520	161520	well, how does the cloud fit into this equation and
162280	167040	Same for mobile devices mobile devices are now the most common computing device in the world
167160	172560	They are the majority of compute the reason iPhone and Android dominates just because there's so many of them
172560	178200	We figure this four billion smartphones operating in the world which pretty much is one for every adult human and
179000	181000	We've transformed society for that
181640	186760	Fundamentally we are all cyborgs right we have digital extensions to ourselves now
186760	192760	We tend to because of science fiction think about cyborgs as the digital stuff is inside you, but a yuck
193880	195880	And B impairs upgrades
196880	201200	But if we don't think of our phone as an extension of ourselves try losing it for a day
201720	205400	Like we're pretty agitated when we don't have that device around it's our communication device
205400	210440	We would just take it for granted that we could talk to anybody anywhere if they'll answer which they won't
211400	217960	Or we at least message them and whatever messaging constraint you currently have the Venn diagram of messaging systems is continued to be messy
217960	221880	But that's because it's so all-encompassing and so we can't talk about
222880	228480	Future of compute and and the kind of work we're going to be doing if we don't include these devices and how they're going to evolve as well
228640	230640	We know how to make an awful lot of data
231640	235960	That's just a byproduct of having a lot of devices feeding into common reservoirs, right?
235960	239440	The you know ultimately a lot of what's made the modern machine land
240000	245480	Machine learning models exist is because of this is tremendous feed of data that we're generating on the behalf of others
246600	251560	And all of these are obvious trends more compute more cloud more devices
251880	256640	More data nothing surprising here. It's all expected. What are the unexpected things?
256640	259400	We're we're we're going to hit limits in the next ten years
260000	263480	For me the big one is we are finally going to run Moore's law to the ground
264000	268360	So Gordon Moore is a person. He was one of the founders of Intel
268800	272040	They were one of the first companies to make micro processors
272040	276960	Well, actually they first made Ram that was their original product when when Intel started up
277160	284520	Ram was still largely core Ram little ferrous coils wound with copper to store bits sounds as reliable as you think it would be
285160	287160	And so the idea of building
287760	293280	Silicon substrate Ram was a big deal and that was an Intel's original product and it was while they're making Ram
293800	298640	That Gordon Moore observed that for roughly the same amount of cost
299640	306040	Every 18 to 24 months. We could double the number of circuits on the piece of silicon
306960	309560	Now they only were able to do that by working very hard at it
310440	313560	Later that would be called Moore's law. It's not a law
314440	317880	Right a law is something that happens whether you work hard at it or not
318840	322080	Like gravity you don't have to do much gravity is going to apply
322800	330440	But for Moore's law to be a law companies work extremely diligently to increase the density of electronics and it's worked if you'd
330760	335720	So pull this data from Wikipedia. This is a sort of chart of the processor
336200	339480	The density of transistors in processors from the original
339840	346200	4004 in 1970 up till around now and you see how clean that line is and that's because we have an
346520	352360	Exponential number on the left of the number of transistors if I didn't use an exponent on the left and go up orders of magnitude
352600	357360	We get the hockey stick the dumb graph where nothing is meaningful and then it shoots up at the end
359080	363000	It's a bad way to explain this honestly, I mean and we're technical people
363680	369640	Getting our heads around an exponential function is hard when I'm explaining it simpler. I talk about things like this
370720	374040	What is that warp drive for the enterprise? No, that's this
374760	376760	This is a cray
377080	379080	XMP supercomputer circa 1985
379920	385800	They've only they only made a couple of hundred of these that at in 1985. This was the most powerful computer
385800	387800	You could buy they were millions of dollars
388440	393560	They ran on on 200 kilowatts of power. So you kind of need to bring your own generator
394800	401640	They're cooled with mineral oil because they're running so hot without mineral oil pumping through it all the time that it will melt
402120	403560	You notice it's kind of curved
403560	406120	They're trying their best to keep the wires as short as possible
406560	409640	So the speed of light doesn't impair the performance of the computer
409720	415640	This is leading edge technology in 1985 and it's knocking out about 1.9
416480	417880	Gigaflops
417880	424480	per second so just about two billion floating point operations per second in 1985 they modeled
424640	431720	Nuclear explosions on this the Voyager missions were computed on computers like this doing the orbital calculations
432520	434520	fast forward a few years say
434920	436920	2011 the iPad 2
437440	439440	About 800 bucks
439680	441840	Don't put it in any liquids. That's a mistake
442840	448520	It runs, you know on its built-in battery for about 20 hours and it's got about
449760	451760	1.9 gigaflops of processing power
451880	459000	So 26 years later the most powerful computer in the world is now a device you give to children and
459640	461640	They play candy crush on it
462800	465240	That's the advancement of society and
465720	467160	This face it that's not fast
467200	470840	That's a 20 at 2011 device and a consumer device at that
471360	477320	Today if you're a consumer you want a high-performance compute device you buy a very expensive video card, right?
477320	482760	An RTX 4090 these days if you can find one, they're a couple of grand
483640	485640	You know, they're not cheap
485640	486600	but
486600	488600	16,000 cores in it
489080	493320	currently pulls down about 82 teraflops at full bore so
493400	498240	40,000 times faster than the iPad 2
499000	502640	So 11 years later, you know, and that's this is also
503520	505280	450 watts
505280	510560	So, you know, you can heat the room with it if you like like I hope you bought a big power supply because you're gonna need it
510560	514440	And if you want you can run too. I don't know why you would
515240	517400	Nobody's mining Bitcoin anymore. That's done
518840	521280	And it's still a consumer device today
521320	524120	There's a today the fastest computer in the world the supercomputers of the world
524120	531960	There's a race going on between the Chinese the Americans and the Japanese and the current leader like literally this past fall
532200	538880	Was the frontier supercomputer in Oak Ridge labs? So that's in Tennessee in the US. That's based on the HP architecture
538880	541840	so this is a massive multi-processor machine and
544920	548480	1100 petaflops or 1.1 exa flops
549480	551480	For about six hundred million dollars
552440	555800	Needs about 20 megawatts of power. So bring your own nuclear reactor
556800	558800	and takes up about
559440	562880	700 square meters. So clear out the basement
565280	567880	13,000 times faster than the 4090 or
569280	572920	600 million times faster than the iPad 2 or the cray XMP
574280	576120	Moore's law
576560	582560	That's what we're talking about is our ability to continue to extend compute and I like that comparison where the cray
582960	588840	Compute power became our consumer device like are we going to have an exa flop device in our hands?
589200	591840	It's possible. I don't know what you'd do with it
592160	596600	But then we didn't know we needed to play candy crush in the first place right it just emerged that way
597520	603040	And Moore's law is ending this graph cannot continue. Why why are we running into the limit?
603280	607640	Well, we're getting better and better at packing transistors into smaller and smaller space
607640	615280	And you'll hear these terms like the 10 nanometer process and the seven nanometer process and the five nanometer process
616400	619400	Scientists have built a one nanometer transistor, but only one of them
621480	627920	Those are all rough measurements, they're not realistic in the actual circuits are more complicated that we have good
629080	632880	Sensors now this is an electron tunneling image of the
633040	638160	IBM five nanometer process. So this is doped silicon layered together
639640	646320	It's hard to measure what we talk about nano things all the time is compute people the billionth of something a billionth of meter
646320	650760	Is really really small people can't understand a billion right same problem is that exponential function?
650760	657720	And I always describe this as if I want to wait get you to wait for a million seconds a million seconds about 11 days
658800	661320	But a billion seconds is 33 years
662080	667280	So the idea that a nanometer is to a meter as a second is the 33 years
667920	674600	And we're making stuff at that scale today. That's how dense we're getting this is kind of this is stanling
674920	676920	scanning tunneling microscopy of a
677640	680560	Silicon substrate the yellow dots are
681320	685760	Silicon atoms the blue holes are phosphorus atoms
686120	689040	We talk about doping silicon when we make
689520	694720	Integrated circuits so that they change their voltage behavior so that you can apply voltage and pass it through a semiconductor
695040	698920	This is literally the structure of it. It is a crystal
700040	702040	And when you get down into those
702560	705040	nanometer scales, we're running out of atoms
705840	711680	A silicon atom is 111 picometers across like point one nanometers
711840	713840	so when you start talking about a
714720	722120	Transistor layered together. That's only a couple of dozen nanomies across. It's only hundreds not even hundreds of atoms
723640	728240	Strictly right quantum effects start to apply like we're just getting as dense as we physically
728760	735140	Can get and that's going to be the limit and not only that we can make these things at all that that we can make
735880	738400	Billions of transistors on a given die
739120	741120	for about a thousand dollars
742120	746720	Right keep the prices stayed consistent the manufacturing process has to keep improving
747120	750680	Without really raising the price so that we'll continue to buy them
751520	755720	And again, we get debate like how fast did you need to go and how density need to be?
755800	761200	But we've built our entire industry of on the fact that we're going to have more compute in about two years
761680	763680	for the same amount of money and
763920	765920	That ends in the next decade
766920	769920	Now there's a bunch of things that we're doing or
770680	774320	Haven't been doing because of Moore's law one is we have not really improved
774760	777080	Architectures for the most part especially if you're talking about Intel
778000	781320	They've more or less sold the same core chip design
781880	785440	For 40 years because every time they try to change it we got very angry
785960	792040	Because it wasn't compatible with what we've done before and we like compatibility more and so at this point that perpetually
792280	800760	Evolving x64 and x86 architecture has gotten fairly convoluted the amount of steps involved in a given work cycle
800960	803320	even if it's going at multiple gigahertz is
804000	809120	Complex now we do have simpler architectures the arm architecture came along quite a few years ago and
809640	813680	It was built for more power efficiency more compute efficiency
813680	817840	It just didn't have the legacy that the other systems have but arms pretty mature today
817880	825560	It's one of the reasons you're seeing more and more interest in arm in general for compute because the amount of energy necessary for a given unit of work is
825560	827560	lower in those architectures
828320	832360	You can expect as we lose the ability to get more compute
832600	838520	For free by buying the next generation processor that optimizations in architecture become much more important
839000	843720	Now for us as programmers for the large part. We're insulated from that our modern programming environment
844320	850560	Almost completely abstracts us from the actual underlying hardware if you're living in a dot in dot net land
850960	854760	It's Microsoft's responsibility to make sure that the common language runtime
855160	860480	Compiles and optimizes to the processor you have they do that all of the time. We don't even think that it happens
860480	866200	It's kind of magic. It just works in that brief period where they thought arm was a really good idea now
866200	870000	They're coming back to that idea again. You could compile dot net to arm
870640	874760	It went away, it'll be back because it's nothing that we have to do
874840	879360	It's their responsibility to do implementations against the hardware. That's the power of abstraction for us
879360	885880	I would argue that today the M1 and the M2 made by Apple are the most advanced
886720	888720	processors out there architecturally
889560	894880	They're arm-based, but they've also added they've condensed a lot of things. Most of the memory is here
895680	901520	They have a tensor compute units or basically units optimized to do neural neural net calculations
901520	905040	They have the GPU integrated in putting all those things in a single die
905720	911440	Putting 40 billion transistors together all working and playing happily has some benefits
911440	915160	And so, you know, those are some of the nicest computers we can buy today
915160	919680	And it sort of speaks to what the future looks like and I'm I'm an advocate of William Gibson
920120	924680	The guy who coined the term cyberspace while typing it on a Wedgewood typewriter
925280	929800	But his quote is the future is here. It's just not evenly distributed
930720	936040	So if you want to understand the future one of the easy ways to go is go look at where the concentrations of real rare
936200	939840	Innovation are and what's happening in Cupertino with processors like this is pretty profound
940040	948000	It speaks to what phones should look like in the future and what our other compute devices can be deeply integrated circuits the modern
948840	950840	manufacturing foundry
951320	954040	Allows us to build very customized
954560	961120	Circuits that are as close together as possible to run as fast as possible with the least amount of heat and the least amount of battery waste
962040	963400	All right
963400	969440	Let's stop talking about the underlying hardware the net real constraint these days is the network
970160	976560	5g was wonderful. It was heavily advertised a few years ago. Now it's here and nobody can tell works perfect
977600	979600	I mean the
981000	983000	It's a good question
983320	988480	In theory these standards for wireless are about
989080	990200	increasing
990200	996560	Frequency to intensify more data so more people can communicate simultaneously the downside is as you move up in spectrum
996720	998720	You decrease the penetration
999080	1006320	So our old 2g phones which were living down in the 900 megahertz range worked beautifully in basements
1006520	1010640	When we got up to 3g and 4g phones and we moved up to the 2 gigahertz band range
1010840	1015760	We had trouble communicating into in closed areas, right? Some buildings work some not so much
1015760	1017840	It was easy to get into a Faraday cage rear phone wouldn't work
1018600	1025800	5g bumps this up into the 20 gigahertz range big increase in data density, but the penetration goes down a fair bit
1025800	1027800	It's blocked by things like
1027800	1029800	trees
1030000	1035000	Bodies, you know, I've stood in front of a 5g tower doing a speed test with my phone and going wow
1035000	1037000	That's smoking fast and then I turned around
1037880	1041040	And then 20 gigahertz apparently doesn't go through me
1042200	1046840	So there's challenges for these higher frequencies. There was the 6g specification underway
1047600	1052480	But there's no simple solutions here network is going to be our constraining resource as
1053240	1058240	Developers we have to think hard about how we move data between points of compute
1058720	1062600	That's always going to be a limitation. There are no workarounds largely for
1063000	1067320	For the laws of physics the speed of light. That's a law
1068720	1075640	This the modern is a the the the satellite networks that are going up now are very interesting
1076480	1084000	For certain applications what we've really reached is a point where much of the parts of the globe that don't have good cellular coverage
1084360	1087600	Can have sufficient satellite coverage?
1088160	1092840	So more and more we're reinforcing ester Dyson's belief that it was easy
1092840	1096760	It was easier to put networking everywhere than it was to build a good disconnected client
1097880	1100680	So if you just keep presuming we're gonna have them with everywhere
1100680	1107200	I got I got on the early Starlink beta because I have a place sort of up in the wilderness in BC where the bears are even more common and
1107880	1112040	It's an insuppressive like that's just a pizza box size antenna
1112080	1114960	You need a clear shot of the sky. That's the hard part
1115160	1116960	And if you've got a clear shot of the sky
1116960	1123560	You've got about 400 megabits down and 100 up at 29 at 20 milliseconds you can game from there
1123560	1129880	It's not as fast as your your your synchronous fiber, but it's faster than you would get in most isolated areas
1131160	1136560	So that ubiquitous connectivity and huge amounts of compute available in very small devices
1136560	1139080	You know the other side of Moore's law is the old hardware gets very cheap
1139080	1144200	And so we're seeing things like automobiles where they won't spend money on compute. They still have it
1145120	1147320	They're still they're now starting to put 3g
1147760	1152800	Cell services into all cars so that all cars have telemetry back to the factory whether you want it or not
1153360	1157360	Because it's more important for the factory to know about what how you're using the car
1157840	1163520	So this model of the ubiquitous computing is emerging more and more where every device has an IP address and
1164360	1169840	Can connect to the network and and is communicating perhaps not for your benefit before the vendors benefit
1170040	1174440	But it's always communicating and we have options there. We're gonna be responsible for a lot of it
1175080	1179680	I'd be remiss in just setting the stage for all this to not talk a little bit about the pandemic
1179680	1183840	Well again when I wrote the original version it wasn't the thing, but we've continued to deal with this
1183840	1185840	That's obviously in the later stages
1186360	1194160	Our friend Sachin Adele said was famously quoted by May of 2020 saying two years of cloud migration happened in two months as
1194600	1196560	We've as everyone discovered yes
1196560	1202920	You can work at home and we tore apart our perimeter networks and shoved and expanded our VPNs and
1203400	1209320	Quickly shuffled whatever we could into the cloud. We changed the landscape of work. We changed the landscape of compute
1209320	1215120	I mean for most of us in our industry working from was just not a big deal. We've been doing it anyway
1215120	1221640	I do hope one day to make either a video series or a talk just on how video
1221880	1224280	Conferencing evolved over those two years
1225000	1227280	Remember that period where everybody thought all of those
1227800	1231280	Inlaid graphics with the hats and in the horns and things was a good idea
1231280	1234040	It lasted like three months for three months everybody had fun with that
1234040	1239480	They're like, okay, that's really dumb and they turn that off, but that's the evil evolution of etiquette perception
1240240	1244800	And today it's really interesting to see how everybody comes on with a face initially says hi
1244800	1247280	Then when somebody actually starts to talk most cameras go off
1247720	1253680	To not distract like that. We're developing an etiquette for that model. We were rushed to do it
1254400	1256360	But we're also seeing the other side of the pandemic
1256360	1263200	We're starting to see the economic impacts we the side effect of mass layoffs was a loss of expertise that in general all
1263880	1269400	Workchains are less efficient today as we tried to gear them back up and you have a 20 or 30 or 40 percent
1270560	1274120	Inexperienced worker role in across those chains of work
1274120	1277120	You have a lot more mistakes and they cascade on top of each other
1277600	1285480	We had the supply chain deeply disruptive ports that were had had too many empty containers and not and not enough full ones
1285480	1289280	Not enough space to move things around and literally going to take years to straighten it out
1289280	1295240	And then the byproduct of all of that friction and supply was an increase in demand for certain goods
1295240	1300120	Which then got interpreted as inflation and here we are it's 2023. I hope you're having fun
1301120	1306680	Now what does this mean for us in our industry specifically because for the most part
1307680	1309960	We've had 20 years as developers
1310720	1312720	Just in a growth mindset
1313480	1318640	2008 2009 not withstanding the sort of great recession because I think for the most part technical industry was insulated from that
1318640	1320640	We were not as impacted as much as many others
1321200	1325480	So I've talked to folks that have been working since after the dot-com bus
1326400	1330240	2002 and it's just been build what you want go faster build more
1330680	1334960	You know explore great ideas now. I'm older than that
1334960	1342480	I started writing code in the 80s when economics are a lot tougher and we focused really hard on this contact of return on investment
1345360	1350480	The problem is that when we're software developers we rarely are directly responsible making money for the company
1351160	1357160	Typically the things that we make are tools that allow those that make money for the company to work more efficiently
1359120	1363120	If the things we're making don't do that, they're really not that important
1363880	1369720	You know this capitalist model has always functioned on the idea of rapid relatively inefficient growth
1370120	1376920	Followed by a period of sort of cleanup shaking out the weak stuff a bit of a recessionary period for a year or so
1376960	1380160	We cut the sort of fat off and then we'll grow again
1380800	1386440	Except that we've gotten good enough with our economic models to avoid that whole cleanup phase for 20 years
1386960	1390600	and now that we're looking at one in a very serious way and
1391120	1395520	Folks are seeing that you know what it's like to have a five or six percent interest rate and
1396160	1399520	They you know new costs of things the pressure on energy and so forth
1400640	1404080	Companies are being more reflective. They're sort of looking back and going are we doing the right things?
1404080	1405280	Are we focused on the important stuff?
1405280	1409960	And it's in our best interests with our skills and the main nose and the companies that we're working in
1410160	1412160	Make sure you know how your company makes money
1412720	1414720	Make sure the things you're building
1415200	1418680	Help that because we are productivity amplifiers
1419160	1424600	We're incredibly good at building tools that allow the rest to work faster to do more
1424880	1429040	We can help companies survive in difficult times if we work on the right things
1430360	1436560	All right, we wanted to talk about technology. We've kind of set the stage. Here is the landscape we live in today
1437440	1442240	So now that we know we're living in a cloud and living in a cloud world mostly smartphones
1442480	1450040	We're not going to count on you compute going much faster and in general our employers and our customers are really tighter with their cash
1450640	1452640	What should we do?
1453400	1456560	Start with the browser market because the browser market is
1457120	1459120	Kind of stable now
1459120	1461600	If you really want to use up a lot of memory in your computer
1461600	1467400	There's chrome if you want to be frustrated with how well your websites work you've safari if you want to use a browser
1467400	1474120	Nobody else cares about there's edge and if you want to be an angry anarchist. There's Firefox like you have choices, right?
1475680	1480520	There's no perfect solution any of these there nobody's utterly dominating the market
1480520	1484440	I mean chrome is still a big player especially for your typical employer
1485480	1490320	That's likely the browser using you tend to build to that and we're clearly seeing the rough edges
1490360	1494480	We're not all the same same things work together, but we have the tooling sets and
1496600	1500560	You know in on Donna rocks we made fun of the rapid rates like hey
1500560	1503720	We've got an hour-long show here. There'll be at least two more framers before this is done
1504440	1508520	That I feel like that pace is eased off a little. I think people want a certain level of stability
1509080	1512160	you know angular is not the new sexy anymore, but it's
1512840	1518920	It's utilization level inside of larger companies is massive and those top three across the board seem to be
1519120	1526640	that you know majority of web development and we're still doing mostly browser development especially for companies because it's also deployment issue and
1526840	1530760	They're always running latest version and that's things we want from that
1530760	1537680	Even if we have to constrain the feature set someone and getting and all of these libraries have some degree advantages for
1537920	1539720	working in the
1539720	1545680	heterogeneous client world that we have that people are expected to be able to use those pages on a phone and on a tablet not a
1545680	1548920	PC and have a reasonable experience on all of them. It's still not easy
1550440	1556040	Development for us has all the easiest time of development was when the device you were writing the code on was the device
1556040	1559440	It would normally run on that just hasn't been true for 20 years
1559760	1566160	Whether we acknowledged it or not now we typically are writing on a desktop PC or a robust laptop
1566160	1571000	But we're running it on smaller form factor devices and that's a way more difficult thing to develop for it
1571120	1576840	More complicated model. It's a longer cycle, but if you're not respecting that cycle you struggle with what you're making
1577920	1583040	The progressive web app movement has helped us at the minimum to give us an icon
1583040	1587320	For regular users to be able to get to that web page because goodness knows they couldn't figure bookmarks out
1587800	1591240	All right, so now we have an icon. It starts up a frameless browser
1591920	1597600	We're that's good enough. There's a bunch of other great stuff in PWA and the three guys to use it think it's great
1598600	1606840	And then there's our friend Steve Sanderson who brought us web assembly in the form of what would eventually be known as blazer
1607560	1608760	now
1608760	1612120	He didn't invent it. You know, he wasn't first, but he
1612680	1618320	Definitely brought it for us in the dot-net community back in 2016 at the NDC conference in Oslo
1618360	1621960	He showed it off for the first time with a very bizarro version of C sharp
1622240	1629800	That allowed us to run C sharp on the browser and really what web assembly is evolved into is a kind of container strategy
1630160	1635120	Where the inside service of the container is this browser environment a sandbox
1635120	1639000	That's relatively safe to operate within and you can introduce almost any kind of code
1639560	1641280	Microsoft took their time
1641280	1645040	Committing to blazer Microsoft doesn't like being first. It seems these days
1645080	1650000	They kind of sat on that project as an experimental project until go lang for web
1650000	1653480	W a shipped as soon as that happened well then blazer came out
1653480	1657800	But it was like when nobody wants to attack Javascript, but we do want to program in the languages
1657800	1663480	We want to program the devices we want to program in and w a gives us this ability to program in the languages of choice
1663640	1668400	Down on the client device still in the browser. So I still have my deployment issue solved
1668400	1671200	I still have continuous update models or every time you click on it
1671200	1675920	You get the latest version like all of the benefits of working in web development, but now I get the language that I want to use
1676600	1682800	And if you've listened to the show, you know, we've been talking about other places that this container could run
1682800	1686760	I mean blazer made it absolutely obvious to us that we can run it on the server
1686760	1692440	We can run it on the client, but now it's interesting to start thinking about different points of compute. I
1693200	1698840	Don't want this code to necessarily run on the client device, but I wanted to run close to the client
1699000	1701000	So could I define a
1701360	1707400	Set of parameters for where this X block of code could execute that it could run in a CDN an edge point of some kind
1708160	1710160	No, and this is all
1710520	1717160	Experimental, but I'm hearing it more and more often that the web assembly is a another kind of container
1717760	1721760	And what the potential of that offers to us long term
1721880	1728000	So if you haven't explored this world and sort of poking around what's possible there just understand this is an area of growth
1728600	1732820	Extremely smart people are looking at where they can take web assembly to
1734440	1737040	Now if you want dumber areas we could talk about web 3
1738960	1743240	It's easy to make fun of mostly because it's pretty silly I
1744600	1746960	See it coming down to three central ideas
1748600	1753320	Decentralized web is I think the most reasonable aspect of web 3
1753880	1756200	We
1756200	1761280	If you think about web 1 late 90s early aughts the whole dot-com boom
1761920	1765800	Dot-com from Microsoft perspective for the idea of the internet becoming a popular thing
1767000	1772060	That was very decentralized people ran web servers on machines under their desks
1772600	1776200	Connected to the internet. It wasn't a good idea, but it's something we did and
1777000	1783120	It was powerful and flexible except it wasn't reliable right sometimes that machine sometimes you trip over the power cord
1783640	1789600	Sometimes the cat barfs into the CD drive right like stuff happens and that machine was actually on the internet
1790840	1795800	Web 2 was far more centralized right we gave up our ownership of those
1796400	1802200	Devices in on the internet for a service provider. It's just that we chose folks like Facebook
1803000	1806320	But you can still put geocities in that can as well if you want
1806520	1811560	But we now we're getting into more interesting compute models with distributed execution
1811760	1817520	And the problem of course is that those products turned into other kinds of exploitation of us
1818160	1819400	And
1819400	1823280	That's not controlling the value we're actually making and now everyone's a little bit sick of it
1823280	1826840	And so decentralized web is becoming hip again. Just trying to do it in a better way
1828280	1833280	Me running on the cloud you could still be largely decentralized because it's all about ownership of data
1833360	1836600	So can you run your own services through a provider?
1836880	1841440	Who's not really running competing services directly, but rather having other people compete in that space
1841440	1844280	I look more to stuff like the Shopify model
1844760	1851680	Where there's no reason for you to employ your own e-commerce engine anymore when you can go to a Shopify and run their engine
1852280	1858720	For a set fee with many thousands of other people running their the same engine for their products
1858720	1865120	The one person not running an e-commerce engine is Shopify themselves, right? They're not a competitor in your own space
1865520	1867520	That's fairly decentralized. I can live with that
1867880	1875120	This only parts when we get into web 3. I mean blockchain is not inherently stupid. It's just wildly
1875240	1879640	Misapplied right the idea of a distributed data engine is pretty compelling
1880520	1885680	It's just that people don't think about it. Well, you know when I have a customer asking me about well
1885680	1888400	We got to use blockchain. It's like why because he saw it in a magazine
1888880	1890880	Like what do you want from it?
1890960	1895040	What what's the difference and often with most companies they still want to be central point of control
1895040	1902120	It's like so you don't want blockchain the idea that other entities can introduce transactions on into this data
1902960	1904960	independent of you is
1905320	1909760	The basic stepping point like if you're not going to do that then what are you talking about?
1910680	1915800	Why do you need this? But blockchain's got the problem that BitTorrent has
1916040	1920520	BitTorrent's problem was that it came out of Napster about a stealing music
1920520	1926200	It was a good protocol used for where its initial use was a nefarious use that was ultimately illegal and
1926760	1932040	Blockchain has the same problem. It's bound to crypto and as we're seeing pretty clearly these days
1933040	1935520	Crypto is pretty much a Ponzi scheme and so
1936040	1941480	Are we gonna get something from it eventually? Maybe our most people just gonna lose their money here seems like it
1941480	1945840	It's easier to see that now than it then we saw it before but that's the part that's really
1946360	1948360	contaminating web3 is
1948360	1954680	These fairly good ideas bound up with an idea that was very easy to exploit to fairly destructive purposes
1954680	1959000	And so I think most of us these days who are a little more serious about stuff are going
1959000	1961840	You know, I think I'm just gonna stay back from that
1962960	1966840	Rodeo and let it wind down and then we'll see what pieces are left in the end
1967840	1974600	Web2 didn't happen overnight either this exploration of new ways to use the internet. It's is an exploration
1974600	1975200	It takes time
1975200	1976400	There's no other way to do it
1976400	1983160	And so it's a question of are you gonna jump in and be part of that exploration or are you gonna witness it and then make your
1983160	1984920	move later on?
1984920	1991440	If you think like an engineer you're pretty conservative and you're not the first you're big on the IT mantra of change is good
1991800	1993800	You go first
1994200	1996200	Not a bad way to look at crypto these days
1997560	1999320	Dotnet's in a good place
1999320	2004520	It just knows I'm glad about that I make a podcast called dotnet rocks and back in 2011
2004520	2011080	We thought maybe dotnet doesn't rock and things were pretty hard by 11 years on 12 years on dotnet's rocking pretty hard
2011480	2017160	They've done a remarkable thing. They've rewritten the entire thing to be a cloud-centric
2018000	2023640	heterogeneous client platform with some limitations without having to replace all the tooling in the process. I
2024640	2027600	Mean if you learned how to develop against dotnet in
2027880	2031520	2010 with studio 2010 I can drop you on to studio
2031880	2035120	2022 and dotnet core and you won't be confused
2035640	2041960	You'll more or less get it. There's a bunch of new stuff and there's some edges to things and we focus on some other elements
2042360	2043560	but
2043560	2045560	Really we've had a complete
2046440	2051280	overhaul of this 20 year old stack over the past six seven years and
2052160	2055000	Yet we don't have to relearn we don't have to start over
2055280	2060600	We get to move most of our code on on to it and the new things you write we use familiar skills
2061120	2065520	If anything the biggest problem Microsoft has right now with this is that it's so calm
2065520	2070120	It's so similar. We still have our old practices. We're not using the new language features
2070120	2074440	We're not taking advantage of the new stuff that's been brought to it and the only way they're gonna fix that is tooling
2075480	2077280	Because compatibility is so important
2077280	2082640	They're not going to take stuff away if you're using C sharp to constructs. They're going to keep working
2083440	2085520	But you probably want to use a new one
2085520	2090040	So I think you're gonna start having more clippy events where pops it goes. Wow, you're coding like it's
2090480	2092480	2007 can I help you?
2092600	2094600	Because you clean help and
2095320	2098120	The big new tool in this space is Maui
2098400	2105880	So this is the culmination of a tremendous effort inside of Microsoft to consolidate a client development solution
2106080	2111920	That's deals with the heterogeneous client and multiple platforms. It's still pretty raw
2113120	2116320	Again the conservative engineering type of look at that you go, you know
2116320	2119880	I'll let you guys iterate on that a couple of times you guys you kind of get it right at the third version
2120240	2122480	You're kind of like an aversion a half right now
2122480	2128240	So we'll give you a little more time, but the goal is challenging the idea of this
2128600	2135720	Magical unified client development model works for all the devices something we want our customers couldn't care less about
2135880	2140640	The customer only cares that it runs on their device. They don't care if it runs on anybody else's device
2141200	2146360	We're the ones who want to write one code base that runs on all of those devices because otherwise
2146360	2150760	We can't keep them in sync or we're leaving somebody out and they're angry with us and that's never fun
2151120	2156600	So this is Microsoft's client side attempt on this and I mean, I'm I'm excited for them
2156600	2163280	This said the seven version is substantially better. I think this will be almost sexy by November of this year with dotnet eight
2163960	2167480	It just takes time for them to get this many features and this many teams
2168640	2171920	Co-operating across the stacks and if you're sticking with web development
2171920	2175920	I don't blame you because it does it solves this problem with its own set of limitations
2175920	2184040	I've yet to see a Maui implementation of a cross prop platform client solution where I said wow you couldn't do that with web
2185600	2187600	We're not there yet
2188320	2190320	We might be I don't know the answer to that
2193640	2198220	We've talked about this a few times on the show and it doesn't seem to be going away the power platform
2198720	2203840	So here's the other reality is that we kind of know what the client space landscape looks like
2203840	2206400	We know there's phones and tablets and PCs an
2207360	2212760	awful lot of our data over forms problem space and in work is all dependent on
2213040	2216080	The cloud tenant that our employer has anyway
2216080	2222240	And so the fact that we can essentially run this set of tools that builds a bulk of that for us
2222240	2223960	It's pretty compelling
2223960	2225960	But even more importantly
2227320	2235400	These tools are simple are straightforward enough that a domain expert can take a pretty good shot at an 80% solution
2235840	2241400	For a workflow for a company and then it needs to be cleaned up by some of the bit more experience
2242200	2247480	But a lot of you x development can be done by the person who's going to use it
2248120	2253320	Now this has happened before this is access and visual basic in the middle 90s
2253600	2258840	Where most people who grab those tools were domain experts not developers
2259360	2263280	They became developers later, and I think we're seeing another wave of this
2264560	2270960	But the parts that we find the least pleasant as professional developers that you I multi-platform you I problem
2271280	2273280	this thing kind of knocks out and
2273960	2280040	Then it has a set of hooks back to back-end services with some limitations. They're all customizable
2280560	2284640	We as professional developers can build additional endpoints for the power platform
2284640	2290240	And if you're good at the UX side you can build custom components on the UX side for these domain experts to use too
2290520	2295880	But I'm looking at our to-do list, and we're not getting to the bottom of it
2296240	2301520	So there's a group of people out there that want to move things along by taking on some of that work
2302400	2303640	Do it
2303640	2311160	The way Microsoft's licensed the thing it's for internal apps only you pretty much cannot put a power app into public
2311160	2314360	It has to be authenticated members of the tenant
2315000	2318080	So it's for internal apps
2319080	2321080	They weren't fun to build in the first place
2321360	2325600	So anything we can do to get more of those off the table and modernize them, right?
2325600	2329720	You're looking at that web forms app that the CIO wants to run on their iPad
2329720	2336400	And suddenly the fact that power platform could get you a prototype of that in pretty short order. It's pretty compelling
2338600	2344520	I've mentioned web WA in the context of containerization containerization is an ongoing evolving thing
2344520	2349720	It's only getting bigger. I got a recent show up where we're talking about Azure application
2350280	2352280	identities and
2352760	2356520	That ties into giving a security context to an application
2356520	2359640	It's going to run in the cloud in a lot of ways containers do that too, right?
2359640	2363360	We're demanding a manifest saying this is what the app. This is the resources the app needs
2363360	2366040	This is the operating contents that needs to operate in here
2366040	2371240	The rights that it needs the access points that it needs and more importantly if it tries to do anything isn't in that kill it
2372960	2374960	Containers are just the evolution of that
2375840	2383400	In the next few years, I think we're see containerization of software in general on desktop machines because of the security problems
2384400	2389400	That when a given piece of software gets exploited and it tries to do anything outside of its normal set of behaviors
2389520	2393640	The operating system recognizes that it's exceeding its container limits and stops it
2394720	2399400	Now that was always a good idea and Microsoft's tried to implement this in a few different ways for a long time
2399720	2402120	But I think the security context is going to win. I
2402880	2406880	Look at what's happened in cyber insurance in the past couple of years
2407320	2414080	Today if you want to get cyber insurance not least it more expensive, but even multi they and they require
2414520	2415880	multi-factor authentication
2415880	2420640	But more and more I'm seeing things like you're required to do a privileged access audit. I
2422120	2427800	Wouldn't surprise me at all if the insurers at some point say if the apps if your apps aren't running containers, you're not insured
2428520	2433640	Because they see them as ways to avoid the exploits that the black hats are using
2434280	2438120	So that might be what pushes this technology over the top as it becomes a
2438880	2444320	consistent industry-wide way to resist the ransomware and other security attacks
2445320	2448040	And if you're feeling a little overwhelmed with all the stuff
2448040	2452280	I'm rattling through because I get to just tell stories for a living. I don't have to implement any of it
2452280	2454280	Which is why it's all easy for me
2456280	2458280	That's okay
2458880	2461440	There are a bunch of ways to have a great development career
2461880	2465920	Staying on the leading edge is really fun. If it's fun for you
2466000	2470520	You know the upside the downside to the leading edge is also the bleeding edge and sometimes you bleed
2471480	2477920	You can also have a great career and many people do by becoming an expert in a stack that your company values and staying
2478040	2481400	That expert it may not be the newest technology anymore
2481400	2483400	but it's the one the company relies on and
2483600	2489440	They need those experts and they need you to continue to grow and to be good at that technology
2489480	2494640	And to keep it functional for the organization to keep you into things it needs to don't jump because the thing is new
2494720	2497960	You jump because it can no longer solve the business problems that it needs to solve
2498680	2505520	I've talked to folks that started doing web forms develop in 2005 and their company still uses a ton of it there
2505520	2510120	And it works. It's reliable. It's known set of problem spaces
2510120	2516000	They have a you know, they're 15 years into this or plus and they do I really need to to jump to a new stack
2516000	2518000	It's like no those apps aren't going away
2518240	2523400	And in fact even when they are they're going to technologies that are orthogonal to web forms anyway
2523400	2526960	That's why blazer got so hip if you're a web forms developer and you look at blazer
2526960	2532800	You're just not that surprised this looks like something you've done. It's not that hard to jump on to the new stack
2533800	2534880	So
2534880	2537040	The question is what did you want to do?
2537040	2541640	Do you want to be part of the group of folks that are always learning and pushing on a new thing?
2541640	2543880	Or are you going to be the expert in a given set?
2543880	2550200	You find a space that you like and you stay in that space and you get really good at space and now you're an expert in a
2550640	2552120	diminishing pool
2552120	2554120	Like you're pace still going to be good
2554800	2557400	But you need to maintain your expertise
2557400	2561880	You need to keep figuring out where the limits are and what's possible like it doesn't mean you ever stop learning
2561880	2563880	We don't get to do that in this industry
2563880	2565720	But it's a question of what you focus on
2565720	2572120	Do you really want to learn the new bits where we're all just trying to figure it out or you continue to expand on the space that you're
2572280	2574280	There's not one way to do a great career
2575520	2577520	Let's talk about artificial intelligence
2577840	2583800	And I use this image for the simple reason that it's it is the reason that we think about AI the way we think about it
2583800	2585160	It's terrible term
2585160	2589840	It was coined in the 1950s by a guy named Marvin Minsky when he's trying to sell stuff to the US military
2590280	2595560	The first time regular humans heard the phrase artificial intelligence. It was in the movie
2596040	2600120	2001 a space Odyssey and Hal and then he tried to kill everybody and
2601080	2605080	Set up our relationship with artificial intelligence going forward
2605800	2611440	It's an umbrella term the one thing I know for sure about artificial intelligence is as long as somebody's calling something artificial intelligence
2611440	2616120	It's because it doesn't work as soon as it does work. It gets a new name
2617400	2620720	right it becomes deep learning a predictive analytics or
2621320	2625560	You know to speech tech systems as long as it doesn't work. It's AI and
2626520	2631080	And so when folks talk to me about hey, you know, I'm working on this AI problem
2631080	2636920	It's like, what are you really working on? Like is it a machine learning model? That's the new thing, right?
2636920	2638920	Like really what really came out of
2639120	2644960	Jeff Hinton's papers in 2011 that led to stuff like Siri and all the voice recognition and ultimately these vision
2645640	2650280	Interpretation models is all deep learning models based on machine learning, right?
2650280	2653160	Then this particular graphic I like because the short lines are
2653920	2658480	The oldest technologies that those planning schedule optimization. Those are back in the 50s
2659000	2665720	experts and robotics from the 1970s original speech recognition systems go back to the 80s and then in the 2010s
2665720	2671680	We get this current crop of image recognition vision systems language interpretation
2672160	2677080	And we can incorporate that is our software today. There are good libraries. You don't have to invent stuff
2677080	2682600	It isn't research anymore. You want an image recognition module? It's a module. You load it into your software
2682600	2685600	You have an image to be recognized and it can recognize it
2688080	2694000	This is a real thing the software was doing what you told it to do said, oh, no, no three dogs
2696120	2699080	And you've run into the chatbots, right? They're out there
2699600	2706120	You they're first-line tech support for almost everything today. You're gonna get a chat bot for us and sometimes they're speech bots
2707080	2714760	And they're they are getting better. There's mean. They're good. We all learned to say agent very early on if we want to get out of that loop
2715720	2724020	These are again tooling sets that we can work with the area that I I'm really fascinated by right now that Microsoft's working on are these form
2724520	2726520	recognizers
2726520	2731160	So the idea that I can I can use an image recognition system look at a form and it recognizes
2731160	2735120	What is form and what is data and then associates the two together into?
2735520	2737520	Value pairs
2738040	2744000	That's pretty cool, right that we had a different strategy to digitizing a form rather than building it by hand in
2744800	2748440	In code that now the tool would actually recognize before you generate for you
2748440	2749480	I
2749480	2753480	This was really about using initially paper because they call it a form recognizer
2753480	2756160	Like can I parse a page and have it pull the data out of it?
2756200	2762200	But I immediately thought hey aim that in a at a web forms page and re reimparse it for me
2763040	2765040	And make it into power platform stuff
2765960	2771480	Like can you could I just have a tool thumb through all of the different views and an application and regenerate it in the new language?
2772120	2775080	Why not we have machine learning models that are capable of parsing the data
2776360	2782400	The final area in the machine learning spaces that has gotten powerful actually has been powerful a while and when people are asking about
2782400	2788040	Hey, my kids getting into technology like where's the big career opportunity? It's analyzing data
2788360	2790800	We have more data than ever before we're analyzing it
2791160	2795800	Less and less effectively because we're just outnumbered. There's so much data and only so much time
2795800	2799800	The good news is the cloud is making things simpler for us in the 90s
2799800	2803000	We had most of these predictive analytic models
2803000	2806000	It's just that each one of them represented a huge amount of compute
2806000	2809600	And so you'd do a bunch of pre-work to figure out what the most likely
2810080	2816440	Analytic model will be effective on this given data, and then you'd build out a system and run it once and it would take weeks
2817440	2821240	Today, this is a couple of hours in Azure load the date
2821240	2825080	You'll spend more time loading the data up then you'll run all of the predicted analytic models
2825080	2829280	And then you'll run model analysis against the models to figure out the one that fits the data set best
2830120	2832120	For $20 for the computer
2832880	2841160	So we have better tools than ever for doing advanced analytics and as we go and when we talk about as advanced analytics, you know the predictive model
2841960	2844720	Is really what's the next number that's going to come from this?
2844720	2847480	What's the trend on these is just going up as it's going down, right?
2847480	2852440	We have plenty of tools and those sorts of forms as we start adding in machine learning we do it in bulk
2852440	2858480	We're able to do more of them faster and compare them so that we can select models more efficiently
2858480	2864240	It's less time or your space and more just hammer it with compute, but you can go to a more advanced stage
2865080	2868400	Given you take a predictive model, and it says this is the most likely outcome
2868760	2872800	Now you can actually run a scenario beyond that you're getting into prescriptive analytics
2872800	2875400	So you're cycling the predictive model with actions
2876040	2879240	You've been experienced. This is where you know it or not. Have you lately?
2879920	2884040	thrown a bunch of stuff in a shopping cart and abandoned it and then you get an email from someone saying hey
2884040	2886040	You put this stuff in your cart
2886040	2888480	Like can I give you a 10% off so you'll go buy it?
2889360	2895760	You're seeing a prescriptive model saying how often do I tickle this person now that they've shown some interest to increase the
2895760	2899880	Likelihood of completing a sale. There's no humans involved. It's all software
2900440	2905320	But they're now running these prescriptive explorers to say how often should I hit them?
2905320	2911560	But given a thousand people did that and I emailed them this way. What was the response rate?
2911560	2917240	Whatever you mail in this way. What's the response rate? That's automated now that is prescriptive analytic models
2918160	2924240	Now obviously in the e-commerce sale is one side, but you're also seeing the same models used for things like when should you?
2924520	2926760	Evacuate a town for a forest fire
2927400	2931320	If I wait till it's obvious that the fire is going to hit the town now
2931320	2934920	I risk people's health in the crisis of trying to get them out
2934920	2938880	Or is it better at a low stress level to say let's move them early?
2938880	2942880	It'll cost us less the chance of them being injured killed is lower and
2943640	2946480	Then if the fire goes the other way, it's not that big of a deal, right?
2946480	2951920	We're still building prescriptive models to explore the psychological effects of emergencies and
2952560	2954960	Being able to act more effectively to protect people
2957240	2959240	We can also make video games
2960440	2962720	So this is one of the open AI models
2963560	2966320	In the early days where you would describe a game
2966520	2970240	This is someone making a bad version of asteroids and it would spit out code for you
2970280	2976280	This is not that exciting anymore. Most people have played hopefully with co-pilot now a whole other way to pull up code
2976280	2978920	You don't understand you so have to use stackover flow for this
2978920	2982840	But now you can do a machine learning model. So there's fewer people saying that's a dumb question
2985800	2987640	I'm concerned with the training set
2987640	2993480	We've done a couple of great shows around this with folks like Michelle Manning where we you know
2993480	2999120	It's maybe generating code that works, but isn't secure or isn't you know reliable
2999880	3005320	They've trained it against all of the open libraries on GitHub and that doesn't mean that means it's only as good as the code
3005320	3008760	That we put into GitHub some of the code I put in the GitHub. I'm not proud of
3009720	3015080	So it is interesting to say how can they improve this to say hey, I only want highly secure code
3015280	3020320	That's thoughtful of all of those kinds of things. They're now starting to stick language onto this
3020320	3023400	So now you're gonna talk about what code you want to write and
3024200	3030560	The VP of the power platform Charles Lamanna announced they've not made a version of co-pilot for power platform
3031560	3038440	So, oh you had a no-code solution where you're draggy dropping the form too much work. Just say make me a form
3039200	3043920	All right now use the image recognizer show them a copy of the paper version before and it comes up
3044920	3053840	So those are machine learning models for programming. There are tools for us to use the whole we will all be replaced by this is
3054200	3058800	Silly it always was silly. It's only getting sillier the longer we use these things
3058800	3063600	But if you don't use them in your routine work, you kind of miss it out. It's an accelerant
3063840	3067080	There's no excuse for not understanding the code. You're putting your system
3067080	3072440	So the idea that this is an you're already you were using Google sometimes you're using stack overflow
3072440	3077720	Why wouldn't you use co-pilot to pull up code and then evaluate that code? It's easier than a blank screen
3077720	3084200	It's at all anything we can do to get ourselves moving on a given problem space, but it's still our discrimination
3085200	3091720	The tool does not know that this code is right all it knows it is it fit the criteria you described to it at the time
3092080	3095000	That's as much as know with some percentage of probability
3095720	3098360	hopefully in the high 90s, but not always and
3100120	3106240	Chat GPT about the same thing right there. I call it a Dunning Kruger accelerator
3106920	3110440	If you know nothing about a topic chat GPT is awesome
3110840	3115040	As soon as you know something about a topic and ask chat GDP it's not that awesome
3115880	3117880	Not actually concerned with facts
3118960	3120960	What replaces the smartphone?
3121240	3125240	I mean the smartphone is dominated. It's not the primary computer device, but it's kind of mature
3125720	3127160	you know
3127160	3131600	The phones get bigger they get smaller they have one camera two cameras three cameras way too many cameras
3132160	3134800	But they're kind of the same. They're a slab of black glass
3134800	3139880	We're kind of ripe for disintermediation the obvious devices some kind of AR headset
3140440	3144400	Right is some pair of glasses that we can put on that puts the data directly to our eyes
3144520	3147320	It does everything the phone does without having to pull it out
3147840	3151840	All right, and actually gives us a bunch of other capabilities because now we have instrumentation on our heads
3151840	3155280	so that it can observe the world around us because we're not paying attention and
3156240	3161960	That offers a bunch of possibilities that being said 2023 not a good year for AR
3163200	3166520	Apple's just announced. This is a mock-up of what we thought Apple was going to make
3166520	3170400	It's all a lie and it currently Apple says they're not making anything they've backed off
3170400	3174100	So whatever prototypes they were working on internally, they're not happy with them right now
3174160	3177760	There are commercial products that are glasses with devices on it
3177760	3182760	This is a Qualcomm device called the XR1 you can buy this today. It's about thousand bucks tethered to an Android phone
3182840	3187800	And it's just a USB headset that has microphones and speakers and cameras and and
3188360	3193440	And screens integrated into it and you're seeing these used in certain commercial applications
3193440	3197200	If you want to look more like Google Glass, you can do this with the Toshiba devices. This is the Dyna edge
3197320	3200420	So I want one eye a little more industrial looking
3201000	3206600	Okay, this hardware exists. There is HoloLens, but HoloLens is not in a good place
3206600	3209600	If I was this is the tremble version of HoloLens 2
3209640	3214720	This is the one they wanted to put on all construction workers because construction workers are good with equipment
3215520	3216800	at
3216800	3221120	3000 bucks a piece plus about a thousand dollars a month in operating costs
3222120	3226960	When I when we started doing some case studies on implied HoloLens products
3226960	3231340	I was stunned at how much Azure eats to operate it properly like
3232280	3236000	Now for certain markets that makes perfect sense construction site not so much
3237360	3242680	But if you've been paying attention to the recent round of layoffs, you know, they've pretty much laid off the entire HoloLens team
3243440	3247480	The leader of the HoloLens team a guy named Alex Kipman left Microsoft back in July
3247800	3252040	So they've been a little bit leaderless for the past few years and the army announced they shut down there
3252040	3256680	They were gonna shut down a project. They want to do more research on it and then these round of layoffs came
3256680	3259440	So it looks like the HoloLens is an orphan for the moment
3259440	3265680	I mean the the opportunity in certain verticals is really interesting the you know industrial applications where
3266120	3269280	Basically equipment becomes transparent checklists are live
3269600	3275640	You're making continuous video record of the maintenance that you're doing. These are all interesting applied cases
3275640	3277640	I looked at this very much as the
3278160	3283800	That the AR glasses were in the same place that the BlackBerry phone was in like the 1990s
3284840	3289320	In the 90s if you want an email on your phone, I know crazy
3290480	3294400	You had to buy these a thousand dollar phones in the 90s
3295120	3301320	From from rim called the BlackBerry and had a little keyboard on it and you had to run a custom version of exchange server
3302360	3304360	inside of your organization to make it work
3304840	3306960	So you need a couple of guys in lab coats and
3307640	3314560	A whole ton of licenses and you too could have email on your phone and it was so popular in the 90s
3314560	3316560	They called them crackberries
3316880	3322800	But it needed to be the right vertical it needed that cost had to be worthwhile that continuous access that person was important enough
3322800	3328400	Right, you saw it on like the West Wing right the politicians and bureaucrats needed this sort of thing
3329320	3331320	And of course today emails been completely
3331600	3333680	Commercialized it's in every device. It's not a big deal
3333680	3339320	But I look at HoloLens and the AR devices that way for the right vertical where you can afford that
3339400	3344560	Expend is trivial to its value totally makes sense consumer device. No, not there yet
3345240	3351440	And we don't know when we will be it's an insanely complex device now the HoloLens 2 is six years old
3351600	3357320	We never saw the HoloLens 3 so the tick tock of Moore's law still applying
3357320	3362200	We should be able to get dramatically better headset. We're just struggling for the applications for it
3364040	3370680	I'll make fun of meta very briefly. It's not hard to do anymore. It was funnier a couple of years ago. I
3371640	3376240	We would have said hey Zuckerberg created the largest loss of value in all time
3376240	3379960	He burned through ten billion dollars in a year, but then I
3380080	3389000	Mean Facebook was a trillion dollar company now. It's a 300 billion dollar company well done
3390240	3394200	But then you know, let's look at Twitter or Tesla
3394720	3400800	My billionaires messing up their companies seems to be a style. I presume it will pass
3402320	3404240	These headsets are compelling
3404240	3411120	This was really John Carmack the guy behind Oculus that got acquired by Facebook who has now put down his his laptop
3411120	3415160	I go, okay, I've had enough you people and he's left now to so any sense
3415680	3421960	That Facebook's along between Cheryl Samberg leaving and Asia and and and Carmack leaving
3422320	3425760	Zucks by himself and I think fairly far off the rails
3426120	3427720	Microsoft seemed to be playing ball
3427720	3434240	They they wanted a team's version of this with the new the quest pro the $1,500 headset in the horizon workspace
3434240	3439040	They've now backed away from this. So this is kind of a dark time in general
3439040	3443440	We're kind of it for AR and VR if you are interested in developing in the space
3443960	3450280	The obvious tool is unity like the bulk of development being done in the space is done in unity. It's C sharp centric
3450440	3454880	It's its own custom build essentially if you've never played with this is it's an experience
3455080	3458640	And I recommend the tool often to kids who think they want to make games
3459000	3463560	Because you can do a few watch a few videos use the free version of unity and you can do a lot
3463720	3470840	You can make a pretty basic straightforward side scroll and have an experience and then start to think more profoundly about the challenges of writing games
3471680	3475960	But a lot they but unity has going forward is a really good set of 3d libraries
3476480	3478680	For making it easy to do all of that three-dimensional work
3479400	3481400	Okay, one last topic and then we'll wrap up
3481960	3488080	Quantum computing because people love it. So quantum computing is a kind of super computing
3488080	3493720	It's not likely to be a regular general-purpose compute. It's for super compute problems
3493720	3499160	So the same way that we build these titanic supercomputers for modeling weather and things these are the kinds of problems basis
3499160	3500880	The quantum computers good for that
3500880	3506320	There are a number of companies that are building a variety of different styles of quantum computers
3506560	3511720	This to me likens very much to the late 40s early 50s in
3513080	3518000	General computing before the development of the of silicon
3518160	3525000	So every computer is kind of bespoke. This the sycamore computer built by Google. It has 54 qubits
3525000	3530000	It was the first to achieve quantum supremacy where it worked on a particular problem
3530000	3534640	That was considered thousands of years of compute in traditional computing
3535240	3540800	That's questionable. My favorite part of that story was it's a 54 bit computer quantum computer
3540800	3545040	Except one of the bits was broken on performance day. So it was a 53 cubit cubit run
3545920	3550080	this particular design of quantum computers is what they call
3551000	3556680	Transmon quantum processing. So this is kind of this is a way of doing quantum entanglement with ultra-cooled
3557640	3559640	Material they cool in the liquid helium
3560480	3562480	Which is dangerous
3562480	3569480	The Chinese have a photonic quantum computer. They had up and running in about 2020 with a hundred and 13 entangled qubits
3569640	3576200	They did a Bose's sampling compute in 200 seconds. That would have been multi-billion years of traditional compute
3576720	3581160	It was a known problem. It's kind of a proof point. But again, these are
3581800	3587960	Getting there and then IBM's Eagle and Osprey and Condor architectures
3588840	3590840	in the hundred to
3591280	3596440	120 or so qubits that one was in benchmarking in 20 late 2021 2022
3596440	3602840	We haven't seen the results from it yet. They were promising by last year to have a 400 qubit
3603600	3609920	Processor that hasn't materialized yet and this was supposed to be the year they produced a thousand qubits that hasn't happened either
3610360	3613480	The real question is what the hell are you going to do with this thing?
3613760	3615560	Like the only thing ever here on the news
3615560	3619800	This is the end of security that we're going to be able to break our say encryption
3619800	3621440	Which is true?
3621440	3626640	Kinda in the end encryption strategies that use prime number very these very large prime numbers are
3627240	3633080	susceptible to the compute strengths of quantum computer if you have four or five thousand entangled qubits
3633080	3638080	You should be able to crush through 128 digit primes in a matter of seconds
3639400	3641080	We don't have to use
3641120	3646720	Prime based encryption there are other kinds of encryption in fact and the NSA is currently recommending that we switch to a lattice based
3647080	3651720	Encryption, it's just not as efficient to encrypt with other kinds of encryption strategies
3651720	3656960	It turns out the computers are good at prime numbers as a cost effective ways to do encryption as well as decryption
3657120	3661720	So forget the encryption problem solvable not interesting
3662040	3668040	The most interesting problems in the quantum computing space are actually chemistry problems and the classic one for me is in agriculture
3668280	3675960	So in the pre technological era if you wanted to grow crops routinely if you were planting wheat
3676600	3679680	If you kept growing wheat in the same chunk of land year over year
3679680	3685640	You got less and less wheat because you depleted the soil you had to rejuvenate the soil now today in an industrial world
3685800	3691600	We have the Hayrabash process where we make industrial fertilizers and after you have a season of growing wheat
3691600	3697120	You then fertilize the stod out of that land and repopulate that replenish the soil to grow wheat again
3697160	3704960	But before we had that we rotated crops and there are bean plants typically that has a rhizome on it
3705280	3711200	That lives on the roots and inside of that is an enzyme called nitrogenase and nitrogenase
3712360	3719360	Naturally affixes nitrogen it takes water and night from and what and nitrogen from the air and in a catalytic reaction
3719640	3723920	Turns it into ammonia so in the normal crop rotation you would grow a crop of beans
3723920	3729840	You would harvest the beans you plow the plants under and then you let the land go fallow for a year
3729840	3737080	You let those roots rot and they were to release fertilizers back into the soil and then the third year you can plant wheat again
3737160	3743440	That's the traditional non-technical way to do it chemical fertilizers avoided that but chemical fertilizers have their own cost
3744000	3748960	They're about 1% of the energy consumption of this planet is based on making and distributing fertilizers
3748960	3753200	So if we could utilize this thing that a bean plant could do
3753640	3756240	We could have a significant impact on agriculture
3757000	3761160	The problem is that the catalytic reaction that goes on inside of that enzyme
3762000	3766840	involves atoms of molybdenum and iron and it's a 2 to the
3767360	3774280	170th complex problem to understand the electron interaction, which is like more atoms that are on the than they're on the earth a
3776560	3782920	Midsize quantum computer something in the 400 qubit range should be able to solve this should give us an example
3783200	3786640	Of the correct catalytic reaction that doesn't mean we'll immediately be able to implement it
3786640	3791560	But once you know what the reaction looks like you have a chance of now engineering and implementation of it
3791560	3797960	So that we could be making fertilizer directly from air at low power plant power
3798680	3803080	And be able to grow food more routinely. It's an interesting quantum problem
3803080	3807840	There are other quantum chemistry problems like that battery design is largely based on experimentation
3808120	3813160	Not on our actual understanding of the interactions of the compounds what we have done in battery
3813280	3819120	Development today has gotten really good at iterating on trying different combinations not actually understanding the optimal combination
3819120	3821120	It's a quantum computing problem
3821280	3828080	Modern superconductors the Rebco superconductors, which are made from rare earth materials and barium cupric oxide are
3828760	3836240	ceramics that are superconductive at liquid nitrogen temperatures as opposed to niobium Tim, which is superconducting at helium temperatures
3836240	3840680	Which is way harder to deal with we've had these superconductors for about 40 years
3841040	3843040	We just don't really understand how they work and
3844000	3848280	So it's hard to make better ones and again quantum computer quantum chemistry problem
3851160	3855240	These are all deterministic problems so the real question is how many quantum computers do we need?
3855680	3858440	Because once you've solved it you kind of need to solve it again, right?
3858440	3861760	It's not a non deterministic problem where you need to do it every time like a weather problem
3861760	3864920	It's just a deterministic problem and it reminds me of of
3865800	3867080	of
3867080	3873280	Thomas Watson's statement when they were first building mechanical mainframes for the original version of IBM where he told his board
3873280	3878040	I think there's only a market for like five of these and then they went out selling and they sold like 25
3878040	3882240	And it was a revelation, but that was because back then the computer looked like this
3883520	3885520	Right, this is before
3885840	3887840	Intel this is before
3887840	3891240	The silicon transistor you've your computer looks like this
3891720	3896840	You can't envision a smartphone like you can't see it from there. It's it's too hard
3897400	3902360	The first transistor ever made may in Bell Labs the geranium transistor looked like this
3903520	3908240	It's pretty hard to look at that and mink M1 chip
3909760	3911760	All right, it's a big jump
3912560	3914560	So going back to that mainframe
3914760	3916760	What made
3918360	3924440	Traditional computing useful was the integrated circuit. We suddenly had a stable reliable way to make bits
3924840	3930120	We made RAM and then we made processes for them. They were consistent and we could scale them and Moore's law took over
3930120	3935560	We got more and more potential compute. I described to you three different kinds of quantum computers today
3935560	3939000	They were all radically different because there's not a good qubit yet
3939440	3944520	Everybody's trying to make the right qubit. They're exploring their quantum computers are very
3944560	3948960	Much like these bespoke general computers from the 40s and 50s
3949600	3955040	And maybe that's what it's gonna take the my favorite story of this whole thing is the guy one of the guys who made this transistor
3955040	3957040	Guy named William Shockley
3957240	3961680	He was also the guy who who then created a company called Fairchild summer conductor
3961680	3964280	And he tried to make and he made the first integrated circuits
3964280	3970760	And when he was trying to figure out the chemo the chemistry was gonna need to dope it properly and what the ratio should be and so
3970760	3975760	forth he used an old-style mechanical mainframe to do the computation and
3976600	3981960	That gave him the models to be able to build the first integrated circuits that made far more reliable general-purpose computers
3981960	3985400	I wonder if these flaky goofy
3986280	3991720	Unreliable quantum computers are building today or the compute devices will need to find the reliable qubit. I
3992640	3996960	Don't know the answer to that, but I like how the history rhymes. I do know this
3997320	4004480	We're trying to predict the future the best way to do it is to make it and that's us we do this
4004920	4006920	We're going to go out and do some work
4007760	4009080	We're these next couple of days
4009080	4014280	We're gonna do a bunch of learning and we're gonna create the future and I can't wait to see what we make. Thank you for your time
