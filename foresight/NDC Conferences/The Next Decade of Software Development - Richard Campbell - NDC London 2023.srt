1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
I found out like yesterday afternoon that I had to do this talk, so I was preparing so I didn't get a chance to see the keynote

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:13,360
I look forward to watching the video of it. Hi, my name is Richard Campbell. I am an old geek. I've been doing this stuff for a long time

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,760
I'm for British Columbia

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,440
This is a picture of my house on the left and my neighbor's house on the right. We call this the animal highway

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,480
I didn't realize until I put this camera in that we get bears every week

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,760
It's this is about six in the morning in the summertime

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,920
On a Wednesday because Wednesday in my neighborhood is garbage day

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,720
So he's just coming to see if I put out my garbage early or not

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,920
And there are consequences if I do so and actually we get fine if we put out the garbage early

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,640
It's quite against the rules, but it that's what it's like living British Columbia

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,720
It's just forest behind me

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,480
It's like a big old buffet for bears and they come through and check on it

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,920
He sees actually at the at the top of the driveway right now surveying his domain

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
Anybody got the garbage out before he moves on I

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,720
Make a lot of podcasts any done at rocks listeners

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,880
Awesome Carl's not here. I won't be recording it out in a rocks this week

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,960
I'm gonna be doing some run as Carl started down at rocks back in 2002 which predates the word podcast by a couple of years

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,720
I came on board with show 100 in 2005 where it 18 will do 18 30 this week

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,640
It's already in the can and this

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,240
And yeah, a lot of the stuff that I do is based on down to rocks this talk definitely is

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,240
Coming from all these interviews we get to do we get to talk to really smart people

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,840
And so you get to decide to synthesize the sort of vision of what's going on. I do an IT show as well

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,400
Call run as radio and I think a episode 863 went up today

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,760
And for a brief period between 2011 and 2014 we made a show called the tablet show

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,720
Back when we didn't know what to do about tablets and now we know tablet development. It's just development. It's not a big deal

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,400
All right, so we're gonna do a little future prediction

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,720
So let's refer to Niels Bohr's prediction is very difficult, especially about the future although. I don't know what else you would predict

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,600
So let's go through the obvious things that are happening today that are gonna shape the way we build software for the next few years

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,720
I wrote the first version is talking 2019 thinking one of the 2020 is gonna be like and now it's 2023

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,320
And it's not exactly what I thought but

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,360
Did anybody plan up for a pandemic in 2019? I don't think so

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,040
But obviously the cloud has come to dominate in the past few years. It was true

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,360
It was less true in 2018 2019

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,520
But today if you don't have a cloud plan you kind of don't have a plan your your employer is probably gonna ask you

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
well, how does the cloud fit into this equation and

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,040
Same for mobile devices mobile devices are now the most common computing device in the world

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,560
They are the majority of compute the reason iPhone and Android dominates just because there's so many of them

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,200
We figure this four billion smartphones operating in the world which pretty much is one for every adult human and

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We've transformed society for that

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,760
Fundamentally we are all cyborgs right we have digital extensions to ourselves now

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,760
We tend to because of science fiction think about cyborgs as the digital stuff is inside you, but a yuck

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,880
And B impairs upgrades

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,200
But if we don't think of our phone as an extension of ourselves try losing it for a day

44
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,400
Like we're pretty agitated when we don't have that device around it's our communication device

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,440
We would just take it for granted that we could talk to anybody anywhere if they'll answer which they won't

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,960
Or we at least message them and whatever messaging constraint you currently have the Venn diagram of messaging systems is continued to be messy

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,880
But that's because it's so all-encompassing and so we can't talk about

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,480
Future of compute and and the kind of work we're going to be doing if we don't include these devices and how they're going to evolve as well

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
We know how to make an awful lot of data

50
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,960
That's just a byproduct of having a lot of devices feeding into common reservoirs, right?

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,440
The you know ultimately a lot of what's made the modern machine land

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,480
Machine learning models exist is because of this is tremendous feed of data that we're generating on the behalf of others

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,560
And all of these are obvious trends more compute more cloud more devices

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,640
More data nothing surprising here. It's all expected. What are the unexpected things?

55
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,400
We're we're we're going to hit limits in the next ten years

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,480
For me the big one is we are finally going to run Moore's law to the ground

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,360
So Gordon Moore is a person. He was one of the founders of Intel

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,040
They were one of the first companies to make micro processors

59
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,960
Well, actually they first made Ram that was their original product when when Intel started up

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,520
Ram was still largely core Ram little ferrous coils wound with copper to store bits sounds as reliable as you think it would be

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
And so the idea of building

62
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,280
Silicon substrate Ram was a big deal and that was an Intel's original product and it was while they're making Ram

63
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,640
That Gordon Moore observed that for roughly the same amount of cost

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,040
Every 18 to 24 months. We could double the number of circuits on the piece of silicon

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,560
Now they only were able to do that by working very hard at it

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,560
Later that would be called Moore's law. It's not a law

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Right a law is something that happens whether you work hard at it or not

68
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,080
Like gravity you don't have to do much gravity is going to apply

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,440
But for Moore's law to be a law companies work extremely diligently to increase the density of electronics and it's worked if you'd

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,720
So pull this data from Wikipedia. This is a sort of chart of the processor

71
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,480
The density of transistors in processors from the original

72
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,200
4004 in 1970 up till around now and you see how clean that line is and that's because we have an

73
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Exponential number on the left of the number of transistors if I didn't use an exponent on the left and go up orders of magnitude

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,360
We get the hockey stick the dumb graph where nothing is meaningful and then it shoots up at the end

75
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,000
It's a bad way to explain this honestly, I mean and we're technical people

76
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,640
Getting our heads around an exponential function is hard when I'm explaining it simpler. I talk about things like this

77
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,040
What is that warp drive for the enterprise? No, that's this

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
This is a cray

79
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
XMP supercomputer circa 1985

80
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,800
They've only they only made a couple of hundred of these that at in 1985. This was the most powerful computer

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
You could buy they were millions of dollars

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,560
They ran on on 200 kilowatts of power. So you kind of need to bring your own generator

83
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,640
They're cooled with mineral oil because they're running so hot without mineral oil pumping through it all the time that it will melt

84
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,560
You notice it's kind of curved

85
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,120
They're trying their best to keep the wires as short as possible

86
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,640
So the speed of light doesn't impair the performance of the computer

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,640
This is leading edge technology in 1985 and it's knocking out about 1.9

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
Gigaflops

89
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,480
per second so just about two billion floating point operations per second in 1985 they modeled

90
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,720
Nuclear explosions on this the Voyager missions were computed on computers like this doing the orbital calculations

91
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
fast forward a few years say

92
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
2011 the iPad 2

93
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
About 800 bucks

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,840
Don't put it in any liquids. That's a mistake

95
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,520
It runs, you know on its built-in battery for about 20 hours and it's got about

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
1.9 gigaflops of processing power

97
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:39,000
So 26 years later the most powerful computer in the world is now a device you give to children and

98
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
They play candy crush on it

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,240
That's the advancement of society and

100
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,160
This face it that's not fast

101
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,840
That's a 20 at 2011 device and a consumer device at that

102
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,320
Today if you're a consumer you want a high-performance compute device you buy a very expensive video card, right?

103
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,760
An RTX 4090 these days if you can find one, they're a couple of grand

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
You know, they're not cheap

105
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,600
but

106
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
16,000 cores in it

107
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,320
currently pulls down about 82 teraflops at full bore so

108
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,240
40,000 times faster than the iPad 2

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,640
So 11 years later, you know, and that's this is also

110
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,280
450 watts

111
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,560
So, you know, you can heat the room with it if you like like I hope you bought a big power supply because you're gonna need it

112
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,440
And if you want you can run too. I don't know why you would

113
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,400
Nobody's mining Bitcoin anymore. That's done

114
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,280
And it's still a consumer device today

115
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,120
There's a today the fastest computer in the world the supercomputers of the world

116
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,960
There's a race going on between the Chinese the Americans and the Japanese and the current leader like literally this past fall

117
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,880
Was the frontier supercomputer in Oak Ridge labs? So that's in Tennessee in the US. That's based on the HP architecture

118
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,840
so this is a massive multi-processor machine and

119
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,480
1100 petaflops or 1.1 exa flops

120
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
For about six hundred million dollars

121
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,800
Needs about 20 megawatts of power. So bring your own nuclear reactor

122
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
and takes up about

123
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
700 square meters. So clear out the basement

124
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,880
13,000 times faster than the 4090 or

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,920
600 million times faster than the iPad 2 or the cray XMP

126
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,120
Moore's law

127
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,560
That's what we're talking about is our ability to continue to extend compute and I like that comparison where the cray

128
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,840
Compute power became our consumer device like are we going to have an exa flop device in our hands?

129
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,840
It's possible. I don't know what you'd do with it

130
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,600
But then we didn't know we needed to play candy crush in the first place right it just emerged that way

131
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,040
And Moore's law is ending this graph cannot continue. Why why are we running into the limit?

132
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,640
Well, we're getting better and better at packing transistors into smaller and smaller space

133
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:15,280
And you'll hear these terms like the 10 nanometer process and the seven nanometer process and the five nanometer process

134
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Scientists have built a one nanometer transistor, but only one of them

135
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,920
Those are all rough measurements, they're not realistic in the actual circuits are more complicated that we have good

136
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,880
Sensors now this is an electron tunneling image of the

137
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,160
IBM five nanometer process. So this is doped silicon layered together

138
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,320
It's hard to measure what we talk about nano things all the time is compute people the billionth of something a billionth of meter

139
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,760
Is really really small people can't understand a billion right same problem is that exponential function?

140
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,720
And I always describe this as if I want to wait get you to wait for a million seconds a million seconds about 11 days

141
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,320
But a billion seconds is 33 years

142
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,280
So the idea that a nanometer is to a meter as a second is the 33 years

143
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,600
And we're making stuff at that scale today. That's how dense we're getting this is kind of this is stanling

144
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
scanning tunneling microscopy of a

145
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,560
Silicon substrate the yellow dots are

146
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,760
Silicon atoms the blue holes are phosphorus atoms

147
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,040
We talk about doping silicon when we make

148
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,720
Integrated circuits so that they change their voltage behavior so that you can apply voltage and pass it through a semiconductor

149
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,920
This is literally the structure of it. It is a crystal

150
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
And when you get down into those

151
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
nanometer scales, we're running out of atoms

152
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,680
A silicon atom is 111 picometers across like point one nanometers

153
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
so when you start talking about a

154
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:02,120
Transistor layered together. That's only a couple of dozen nanomies across. It's only hundreds not even hundreds of atoms

155
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,240
Strictly right quantum effects start to apply like we're just getting as dense as we physically

156
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,140
Can get and that's going to be the limit and not only that we can make these things at all that that we can make

157
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,400
Billions of transistors on a given die

158
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
for about a thousand dollars

159
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,720
Right keep the prices stayed consistent the manufacturing process has to keep improving

160
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,680
Without really raising the price so that we'll continue to buy them

161
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,720
And again, we get debate like how fast did you need to go and how density need to be?

162
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,200
But we've built our entire industry of on the fact that we're going to have more compute in about two years

163
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
for the same amount of money and

164
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
That ends in the next decade

165
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Now there's a bunch of things that we're doing or

166
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,320
Haven't been doing because of Moore's law one is we have not really improved

167
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,080
Architectures for the most part especially if you're talking about Intel

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,320
They've more or less sold the same core chip design

169
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,440
For 40 years because every time they try to change it we got very angry

170
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,040
Because it wasn't compatible with what we've done before and we like compatibility more and so at this point that perpetually

171
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:20,760
Evolving x64 and x86 architecture has gotten fairly convoluted the amount of steps involved in a given work cycle

172
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,320
even if it's going at multiple gigahertz is

173
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,120
Complex now we do have simpler architectures the arm architecture came along quite a few years ago and

174
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,680
It was built for more power efficiency more compute efficiency

175
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,840
It just didn't have the legacy that the other systems have but arms pretty mature today

176
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:45,560
It's one of the reasons you're seeing more and more interest in arm in general for compute because the amount of energy necessary for a given unit of work is

177
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
lower in those architectures

178
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,360
You can expect as we lose the ability to get more compute

179
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,520
For free by buying the next generation processor that optimizations in architecture become much more important

180
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,720
Now for us as programmers for the large part. We're insulated from that our modern programming environment

181
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,560
Almost completely abstracts us from the actual underlying hardware if you're living in a dot in dot net land

182
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,760
It's Microsoft's responsibility to make sure that the common language runtime

183
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,480
Compiles and optimizes to the processor you have they do that all of the time. We don't even think that it happens

184
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,200
It's kind of magic. It just works in that brief period where they thought arm was a really good idea now

185
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,000
They're coming back to that idea again. You could compile dot net to arm

186
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,760
It went away, it'll be back because it's nothing that we have to do

187
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,360
It's their responsibility to do implementations against the hardware. That's the power of abstraction for us

188
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,880
I would argue that today the M1 and the M2 made by Apple are the most advanced

189
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
processors out there architecturally

190
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,880
They're arm-based, but they've also added they've condensed a lot of things. Most of the memory is here

191
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,520
They have a tensor compute units or basically units optimized to do neural neural net calculations

192
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,040
They have the GPU integrated in putting all those things in a single die

193
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,440
Putting 40 billion transistors together all working and playing happily has some benefits

194
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,160
And so, you know, those are some of the nicest computers we can buy today

195
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,680
And it sort of speaks to what the future looks like and I'm I'm an advocate of William Gibson

196
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,680
The guy who coined the term cyberspace while typing it on a Wedgewood typewriter

197
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,800
But his quote is the future is here. It's just not evenly distributed

198
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,040
So if you want to understand the future one of the easy ways to go is go look at where the concentrations of real rare

199
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,840
Innovation are and what's happening in Cupertino with processors like this is pretty profound

200
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:48,000
It speaks to what phones should look like in the future and what our other compute devices can be deeply integrated circuits the modern

201
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
manufacturing foundry

202
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,040
Allows us to build very customized

203
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:01,120
Circuits that are as close together as possible to run as fast as possible with the least amount of heat and the least amount of battery waste

204
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,400
All right

205
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,440
Let's stop talking about the underlying hardware the net real constraint these days is the network

206
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,560
5g was wonderful. It was heavily advertised a few years ago. Now it's here and nobody can tell works perfect

207
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
I mean the

208
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's a good question

209
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,480
In theory these standards for wireless are about

210
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,200
increasing

211
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,560
Frequency to intensify more data so more people can communicate simultaneously the downside is as you move up in spectrum

212
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
You decrease the penetration

213
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:46,320
So our old 2g phones which were living down in the 900 megahertz range worked beautifully in basements

214
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,640
When we got up to 3g and 4g phones and we moved up to the 2 gigahertz band range

215
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,760
We had trouble communicating into in closed areas, right? Some buildings work some not so much

216
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,840
It was easy to get into a Faraday cage rear phone wouldn't work

217
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,800
5g bumps this up into the 20 gigahertz range big increase in data density, but the penetration goes down a fair bit

218
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
It's blocked by things like

219
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
trees

220
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Bodies, you know, I've stood in front of a 5g tower doing a speed test with my phone and going wow

221
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's smoking fast and then I turned around

222
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,040
And then 20 gigahertz apparently doesn't go through me

223
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,840
So there's challenges for these higher frequencies. There was the 6g specification underway

224
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,480
But there's no simple solutions here network is going to be our constraining resource as

225
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Developers we have to think hard about how we move data between points of compute

226
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,600
That's always going to be a limitation. There are no workarounds largely for

227
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,320
For the laws of physics the speed of light. That's a law

228
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,640
This the modern is a the the the satellite networks that are going up now are very interesting

229
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:04,000
For certain applications what we've really reached is a point where much of the parts of the globe that don't have good cellular coverage

230
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,600
Can have sufficient satellite coverage?

231
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,840
So more and more we're reinforcing ester Dyson's belief that it was easy

232
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,760
It was easier to put networking everywhere than it was to build a good disconnected client

233
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,680
So if you just keep presuming we're gonna have them with everywhere

234
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:27,200
I got I got on the early Starlink beta because I have a place sort of up in the wilderness in BC where the bears are even more common and

235
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,040
It's an insuppressive like that's just a pizza box size antenna

236
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,960
You need a clear shot of the sky. That's the hard part

237
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,960
And if you've got a clear shot of the sky

238
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,560
You've got about 400 megabits down and 100 up at 29 at 20 milliseconds you can game from there

239
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,880
It's not as fast as your your your synchronous fiber, but it's faster than you would get in most isolated areas

240
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,560
So that ubiquitous connectivity and huge amounts of compute available in very small devices

241
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,080
You know the other side of Moore's law is the old hardware gets very cheap

242
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,200
And so we're seeing things like automobiles where they won't spend money on compute. They still have it

243
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,320
They're still they're now starting to put 3g

244
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,800
Cell services into all cars so that all cars have telemetry back to the factory whether you want it or not

245
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Because it's more important for the factory to know about what how you're using the car

246
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,520
So this model of the ubiquitous computing is emerging more and more where every device has an IP address and

247
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,840
Can connect to the network and and is communicating perhaps not for your benefit before the vendors benefit

248
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,440
But it's always communicating and we have options there. We're gonna be responsible for a lot of it

249
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,680
I'd be remiss in just setting the stage for all this to not talk a little bit about the pandemic

250
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,840
Well again when I wrote the original version it wasn't the thing, but we've continued to deal with this

251
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
That's obviously in the later stages

252
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Our friend Sachin Adele said was famously quoted by May of 2020 saying two years of cloud migration happened in two months as

253
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,560
We've as everyone discovered yes

254
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,920
You can work at home and we tore apart our perimeter networks and shoved and expanded our VPNs and

255
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,320
Quickly shuffled whatever we could into the cloud. We changed the landscape of work. We changed the landscape of compute

256
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,120
I mean for most of us in our industry working from was just not a big deal. We've been doing it anyway

257
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,640
I do hope one day to make either a video series or a talk just on how video

258
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,280
Conferencing evolved over those two years

259
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,280
Remember that period where everybody thought all of those

260
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,280
Inlaid graphics with the hats and in the horns and things was a good idea

261
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,040
It lasted like three months for three months everybody had fun with that

262
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,480
They're like, okay, that's really dumb and they turn that off, but that's the evil evolution of etiquette perception

263
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,800
And today it's really interesting to see how everybody comes on with a face initially says hi

264
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,280
Then when somebody actually starts to talk most cameras go off

265
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,680
To not distract like that. We're developing an etiquette for that model. We were rushed to do it

266
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,360
But we're also seeing the other side of the pandemic

267
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,200
We're starting to see the economic impacts we the side effect of mass layoffs was a loss of expertise that in general all

268
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,400
Workchains are less efficient today as we tried to gear them back up and you have a 20 or 30 or 40 percent

269
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,120
Inexperienced worker role in across those chains of work

270
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,120
You have a lot more mistakes and they cascade on top of each other

271
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:25,480
We had the supply chain deeply disruptive ports that were had had too many empty containers and not and not enough full ones

272
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,280
Not enough space to move things around and literally going to take years to straighten it out

273
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,240
And then the byproduct of all of that friction and supply was an increase in demand for certain goods

274
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,120
Which then got interpreted as inflation and here we are it's 2023. I hope you're having fun

275
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,680
Now what does this mean for us in our industry specifically because for the most part

276
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,960
We've had 20 years as developers

277
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Just in a growth mindset

278
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,640
2008 2009 not withstanding the sort of great recession because I think for the most part technical industry was insulated from that

279
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
We were not as impacted as much as many others

280
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,480
So I've talked to folks that have been working since after the dot-com bus

281
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,240
2002 and it's just been build what you want go faster build more

282
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,960
You know explore great ideas now. I'm older than that

283
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,480
I started writing code in the 80s when economics are a lot tougher and we focused really hard on this contact of return on investment

284
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,480
The problem is that when we're software developers we rarely are directly responsible making money for the company

285
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Typically the things that we make are tools that allow those that make money for the company to work more efficiently

286
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
If the things we're making don't do that, they're really not that important

287
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,720
You know this capitalist model has always functioned on the idea of rapid relatively inefficient growth

288
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:56,920
Followed by a period of sort of cleanup shaking out the weak stuff a bit of a recessionary period for a year or so

289
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,160
We cut the sort of fat off and then we'll grow again

290
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,440
Except that we've gotten good enough with our economic models to avoid that whole cleanup phase for 20 years

291
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,600
and now that we're looking at one in a very serious way and

292
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,520
Folks are seeing that you know what it's like to have a five or six percent interest rate and

293
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,520
They you know new costs of things the pressure on energy and so forth

294
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,080
Companies are being more reflective. They're sort of looking back and going are we doing the right things?

295
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,280
Are we focused on the important stuff?

296
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,960
And it's in our best interests with our skills and the main nose and the companies that we're working in

297
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Make sure you know how your company makes money

298
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
Make sure the things you're building

299
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,680
Help that because we are productivity amplifiers

300
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,600
We're incredibly good at building tools that allow the rest to work faster to do more

301
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,040
We can help companies survive in difficult times if we work on the right things

302
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,560
All right, we wanted to talk about technology. We've kind of set the stage. Here is the landscape we live in today

303
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,240
So now that we know we're living in a cloud and living in a cloud world mostly smartphones

304
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:10,040
We're not going to count on you compute going much faster and in general our employers and our customers are really tighter with their cash

305
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
What should we do?

306
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,560
Start with the browser market because the browser market is

307
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Kind of stable now

308
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,600
If you really want to use up a lot of memory in your computer

309
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,400
There's chrome if you want to be frustrated with how well your websites work you've safari if you want to use a browser

310
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:34,120
Nobody else cares about there's edge and if you want to be an angry anarchist. There's Firefox like you have choices, right?

311
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,520
There's no perfect solution any of these there nobody's utterly dominating the market

312
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,440
I mean chrome is still a big player especially for your typical employer

313
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,320
That's likely the browser using you tend to build to that and we're clearly seeing the rough edges

314
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,480
We're not all the same same things work together, but we have the tooling sets and

315
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,560
You know in on Donna rocks we made fun of the rapid rates like hey

316
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,720
We've got an hour-long show here. There'll be at least two more framers before this is done

317
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,520
That I feel like that pace is eased off a little. I think people want a certain level of stability

318
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,160
you know angular is not the new sexy anymore, but it's

319
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,920
It's utilization level inside of larger companies is massive and those top three across the board seem to be

320
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,640
that you know majority of web development and we're still doing mostly browser development especially for companies because it's also deployment issue and

321
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,760
They're always running latest version and that's things we want from that

322
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:37,680
Even if we have to constrain the feature set someone and getting and all of these libraries have some degree advantages for

323
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,720
working in the

324
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,680
heterogeneous client world that we have that people are expected to be able to use those pages on a phone and on a tablet not a

325
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,920
PC and have a reasonable experience on all of them. It's still not easy

326
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,040
Development for us has all the easiest time of development was when the device you were writing the code on was the device

327
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,440
It would normally run on that just hasn't been true for 20 years

328
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,160
Whether we acknowledged it or not now we typically are writing on a desktop PC or a robust laptop

329
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,000
But we're running it on smaller form factor devices and that's a way more difficult thing to develop for it

330
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,840
More complicated model. It's a longer cycle, but if you're not respecting that cycle you struggle with what you're making

331
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,040
The progressive web app movement has helped us at the minimum to give us an icon

332
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,320
For regular users to be able to get to that web page because goodness knows they couldn't figure bookmarks out

333
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,240
All right, so now we have an icon. It starts up a frameless browser

334
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,600
We're that's good enough. There's a bunch of other great stuff in PWA and the three guys to use it think it's great

335
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,840
And then there's our friend Steve Sanderson who brought us web assembly in the form of what would eventually be known as blazer

336
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,760
now

337
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,120
He didn't invent it. You know, he wasn't first, but he

338
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,320
Definitely brought it for us in the dot-net community back in 2016 at the NDC conference in Oslo

339
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,960
He showed it off for the first time with a very bizarro version of C sharp

340
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,800
That allowed us to run C sharp on the browser and really what web assembly is evolved into is a kind of container strategy

341
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,120
Where the inside service of the container is this browser environment a sandbox

342
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,000
That's relatively safe to operate within and you can introduce almost any kind of code

343
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,280
Microsoft took their time

344
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,040
Committing to blazer Microsoft doesn't like being first. It seems these days

345
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,000
They kind of sat on that project as an experimental project until go lang for web

346
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,480
W a shipped as soon as that happened well then blazer came out

347
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,800
But it was like when nobody wants to attack Javascript, but we do want to program in the languages

348
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,480
We want to program the devices we want to program in and w a gives us this ability to program in the languages of choice

349
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,400
Down on the client device still in the browser. So I still have my deployment issue solved

350
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,200
I still have continuous update models or every time you click on it

351
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,920
You get the latest version like all of the benefits of working in web development, but now I get the language that I want to use

352
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,800
And if you've listened to the show, you know, we've been talking about other places that this container could run

353
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,760
I mean blazer made it absolutely obvious to us that we can run it on the server

354
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,440
We can run it on the client, but now it's interesting to start thinking about different points of compute. I

355
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,840
Don't want this code to necessarily run on the client device, but I wanted to run close to the client

356
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So could I define a

357
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,400
Set of parameters for where this X block of code could execute that it could run in a CDN an edge point of some kind

358
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
No, and this is all

359
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:37,160
Experimental, but I'm hearing it more and more often that the web assembly is a another kind of container

360
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
And what the potential of that offers to us long term

361
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,000
So if you haven't explored this world and sort of poking around what's possible there just understand this is an area of growth

362
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,820
Extremely smart people are looking at where they can take web assembly to

363
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,040
Now if you want dumber areas we could talk about web 3

364
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,240
It's easy to make fun of mostly because it's pretty silly I

365
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,960
See it coming down to three central ideas

366
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,320
Decentralized web is I think the most reasonable aspect of web 3

367
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,200
We

368
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,280
If you think about web 1 late 90s early aughts the whole dot-com boom

369
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,800
Dot-com from Microsoft perspective for the idea of the internet becoming a popular thing

370
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,060
That was very decentralized people ran web servers on machines under their desks

371
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,200
Connected to the internet. It wasn't a good idea, but it's something we did and

372
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,120
It was powerful and flexible except it wasn't reliable right sometimes that machine sometimes you trip over the power cord

373
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,600
Sometimes the cat barfs into the CD drive right like stuff happens and that machine was actually on the internet

374
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,800
Web 2 was far more centralized right we gave up our ownership of those

375
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,200
Devices in on the internet for a service provider. It's just that we chose folks like Facebook

376
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,320
But you can still put geocities in that can as well if you want

377
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,560
But we now we're getting into more interesting compute models with distributed execution

378
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,520
And the problem of course is that those products turned into other kinds of exploitation of us

379
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,400
And

380
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,280
That's not controlling the value we're actually making and now everyone's a little bit sick of it

381
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,840
And so decentralized web is becoming hip again. Just trying to do it in a better way

382
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Me running on the cloud you could still be largely decentralized because it's all about ownership of data

383
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,600
So can you run your own services through a provider?

384
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,440
Who's not really running competing services directly, but rather having other people compete in that space

385
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,280
I look more to stuff like the Shopify model

386
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,680
Where there's no reason for you to employ your own e-commerce engine anymore when you can go to a Shopify and run their engine

387
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:58,720
For a set fee with many thousands of other people running their the same engine for their products

388
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,120
The one person not running an e-commerce engine is Shopify themselves, right? They're not a competitor in your own space

389
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
That's fairly decentralized. I can live with that

390
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:15,120
This only parts when we get into web 3. I mean blockchain is not inherently stupid. It's just wildly

391
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,640
Misapplied right the idea of a distributed data engine is pretty compelling

392
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,680
It's just that people don't think about it. Well, you know when I have a customer asking me about well

393
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,400
We got to use blockchain. It's like why because he saw it in a magazine

394
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Like what do you want from it?

395
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,040
What what's the difference and often with most companies they still want to be central point of control

396
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:42,120
It's like so you don't want blockchain the idea that other entities can introduce transactions on into this data

397
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
independent of you is

398
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,760
The basic stepping point like if you're not going to do that then what are you talking about?

399
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,800
Why do you need this? But blockchain's got the problem that BitTorrent has

400
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,520
BitTorrent's problem was that it came out of Napster about a stealing music

401
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:06,200
It was a good protocol used for where its initial use was a nefarious use that was ultimately illegal and

402
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,040
Blockchain has the same problem. It's bound to crypto and as we're seeing pretty clearly these days

403
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,520
Crypto is pretty much a Ponzi scheme and so

404
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,480
Are we gonna get something from it eventually? Maybe our most people just gonna lose their money here seems like it

405
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,840
It's easier to see that now than it then we saw it before but that's the part that's really

406
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
contaminating web3 is

407
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,680
These fairly good ideas bound up with an idea that was very easy to exploit to fairly destructive purposes

408
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,000
And so I think most of us these days who are a little more serious about stuff are going

409
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,840
You know, I think I'm just gonna stay back from that

410
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,840
Rodeo and let it wind down and then we'll see what pieces are left in the end

411
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,600
Web2 didn't happen overnight either this exploration of new ways to use the internet. It's is an exploration

412
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,200
It takes time

413
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,400
There's no other way to do it

414
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:03,160
And so it's a question of are you gonna jump in and be part of that exploration or are you gonna witness it and then make your

415
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,920
move later on?

416
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:11,440
If you think like an engineer you're pretty conservative and you're not the first you're big on the IT mantra of change is good

417
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
You go first

418
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Not a bad way to look at crypto these days

419
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,320
Dotnet's in a good place

420
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,520
It just knows I'm glad about that I make a podcast called dotnet rocks and back in 2011

421
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:31,080
We thought maybe dotnet doesn't rock and things were pretty hard by 11 years on 12 years on dotnet's rocking pretty hard

422
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,160
They've done a remarkable thing. They've rewritten the entire thing to be a cloud-centric

423
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,640
heterogeneous client platform with some limitations without having to replace all the tooling in the process. I

424
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,600
Mean if you learned how to develop against dotnet in

425
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,520
2010 with studio 2010 I can drop you on to studio

426
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,120
2022 and dotnet core and you won't be confused

427
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,960
You'll more or less get it. There's a bunch of new stuff and there's some edges to things and we focus on some other elements

428
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,560
but

429
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Really we've had a complete

430
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,280
overhaul of this 20 year old stack over the past six seven years and

431
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,000
Yet we don't have to relearn we don't have to start over

432
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,600
We get to move most of our code on on to it and the new things you write we use familiar skills

433
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,520
If anything the biggest problem Microsoft has right now with this is that it's so calm

434
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,120
It's so similar. We still have our old practices. We're not using the new language features

435
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,440
We're not taking advantage of the new stuff that's been brought to it and the only way they're gonna fix that is tooling

436
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,280
Because compatibility is so important

437
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,640
They're not going to take stuff away if you're using C sharp to constructs. They're going to keep working

438
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,520
But you probably want to use a new one

439
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,040
So I think you're gonna start having more clippy events where pops it goes. Wow, you're coding like it's

440
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
2007 can I help you?

441
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Because you clean help and

442
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,120
The big new tool in this space is Maui

443
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,880
So this is the culmination of a tremendous effort inside of Microsoft to consolidate a client development solution

444
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,920
That's deals with the heterogeneous client and multiple platforms. It's still pretty raw

445
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,320
Again the conservative engineering type of look at that you go, you know

446
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,880
I'll let you guys iterate on that a couple of times you guys you kind of get it right at the third version

447
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,480
You're kind of like an aversion a half right now

448
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,240
So we'll give you a little more time, but the goal is challenging the idea of this

449
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,720
Magical unified client development model works for all the devices something we want our customers couldn't care less about

450
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,640
The customer only cares that it runs on their device. They don't care if it runs on anybody else's device

451
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,360
We're the ones who want to write one code base that runs on all of those devices because otherwise

452
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,760
We can't keep them in sync or we're leaving somebody out and they're angry with us and that's never fun

453
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,600
So this is Microsoft's client side attempt on this and I mean, I'm I'm excited for them

454
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,280
This said the seven version is substantially better. I think this will be almost sexy by November of this year with dotnet eight

455
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,480
It just takes time for them to get this many features and this many teams

456
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,920
Co-operating across the stacks and if you're sticking with web development

457
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,920
I don't blame you because it does it solves this problem with its own set of limitations

458
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:24,040
I've yet to see a Maui implementation of a cross prop platform client solution where I said wow you couldn't do that with web

459
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,600
We're not there yet

460
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
We might be I don't know the answer to that

461
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,220
We've talked about this a few times on the show and it doesn't seem to be going away the power platform

462
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,840
So here's the other reality is that we kind of know what the client space landscape looks like

463
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,400
We know there's phones and tablets and PCs an

464
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,760
awful lot of our data over forms problem space and in work is all dependent on

465
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,080
The cloud tenant that our employer has anyway

466
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,240
And so the fact that we can essentially run this set of tools that builds a bulk of that for us

467
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,960
It's pretty compelling

468
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
But even more importantly

469
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:15,400
These tools are simple are straightforward enough that a domain expert can take a pretty good shot at an 80% solution

470
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,400
For a workflow for a company and then it needs to be cleaned up by some of the bit more experience

471
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,480
But a lot of you x development can be done by the person who's going to use it

472
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,320
Now this has happened before this is access and visual basic in the middle 90s

473
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,840
Where most people who grab those tools were domain experts not developers

474
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,280
They became developers later, and I think we're seeing another wave of this

475
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,960
But the parts that we find the least pleasant as professional developers that you I multi-platform you I problem

476
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
this thing kind of knocks out and

477
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,040
Then it has a set of hooks back to back-end services with some limitations. They're all customizable

478
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,640
We as professional developers can build additional endpoints for the power platform

479
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,240
And if you're good at the UX side you can build custom components on the UX side for these domain experts to use too

480
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,880
But I'm looking at our to-do list, and we're not getting to the bottom of it

481
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,520
So there's a group of people out there that want to move things along by taking on some of that work

482
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,640
Do it

483
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:31,160
The way Microsoft's licensed the thing it's for internal apps only you pretty much cannot put a power app into public

484
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,360
It has to be authenticated members of the tenant

485
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,080
So it's for internal apps

486
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
They weren't fun to build in the first place

487
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,600
So anything we can do to get more of those off the table and modernize them, right?

488
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,720
You're looking at that web forms app that the CIO wants to run on their iPad

489
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,400
And suddenly the fact that power platform could get you a prototype of that in pretty short order. It's pretty compelling

490
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,520
I've mentioned web WA in the context of containerization containerization is an ongoing evolving thing

491
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,720
It's only getting bigger. I got a recent show up where we're talking about Azure application

492
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
identities and

493
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,520
That ties into giving a security context to an application

494
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,640
It's going to run in the cloud in a lot of ways containers do that too, right?

495
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,360
We're demanding a manifest saying this is what the app. This is the resources the app needs

496
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,040
This is the operating contents that needs to operate in here

497
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,240
The rights that it needs the access points that it needs and more importantly if it tries to do anything isn't in that kill it

498
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
Containers are just the evolution of that

499
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:43,400
In the next few years, I think we're see containerization of software in general on desktop machines because of the security problems

500
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,400
That when a given piece of software gets exploited and it tries to do anything outside of its normal set of behaviors

501
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,640
The operating system recognizes that it's exceeding its container limits and stops it

502
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,400
Now that was always a good idea and Microsoft's tried to implement this in a few different ways for a long time

503
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,120
But I think the security context is going to win. I

504
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,880
Look at what's happened in cyber insurance in the past couple of years

505
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,080
Today if you want to get cyber insurance not least it more expensive, but even multi they and they require

506
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,880
multi-factor authentication

507
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,640
But more and more I'm seeing things like you're required to do a privileged access audit. I

508
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,800
Wouldn't surprise me at all if the insurers at some point say if the apps if your apps aren't running containers, you're not insured

509
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,640
Because they see them as ways to avoid the exploits that the black hats are using

510
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,120
So that might be what pushes this technology over the top as it becomes a

511
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,320
consistent industry-wide way to resist the ransomware and other security attacks

512
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,040
And if you're feeling a little overwhelmed with all the stuff

513
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,280
I'm rattling through because I get to just tell stories for a living. I don't have to implement any of it

514
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Which is why it's all easy for me

515
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,280
That's okay

516
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
There are a bunch of ways to have a great development career

517
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,920
Staying on the leading edge is really fun. If it's fun for you

518
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,520
You know the upside the downside to the leading edge is also the bleeding edge and sometimes you bleed

519
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,920
You can also have a great career and many people do by becoming an expert in a stack that your company values and staying

520
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,400
That expert it may not be the newest technology anymore

521
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
but it's the one the company relies on and

522
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,440
They need those experts and they need you to continue to grow and to be good at that technology

523
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,640
And to keep it functional for the organization to keep you into things it needs to don't jump because the thing is new

524
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,960
You jump because it can no longer solve the business problems that it needs to solve

525
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,520
I've talked to folks that started doing web forms develop in 2005 and their company still uses a ton of it there

526
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,120
And it works. It's reliable. It's known set of problem spaces

527
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:56,000
They have a you know, they're 15 years into this or plus and they do I really need to to jump to a new stack

528
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's like no those apps aren't going away

529
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,400
And in fact even when they are they're going to technologies that are orthogonal to web forms anyway

530
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,960
That's why blazer got so hip if you're a web forms developer and you look at blazer

531
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,800
You're just not that surprised this looks like something you've done. It's not that hard to jump on to the new stack

532
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,880
So

533
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,040
The question is what did you want to do?

534
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,640
Do you want to be part of the group of folks that are always learning and pushing on a new thing?

535
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,880
Or are you going to be the expert in a given set?

536
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,200
You find a space that you like and you stay in that space and you get really good at space and now you're an expert in a

537
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,120
diminishing pool

538
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Like you're pace still going to be good

539
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,400
But you need to maintain your expertise

540
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,880
You need to keep figuring out where the limits are and what's possible like it doesn't mean you ever stop learning

541
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,880
We don't get to do that in this industry

542
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,720
But it's a question of what you focus on

543
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,120
Do you really want to learn the new bits where we're all just trying to figure it out or you continue to expand on the space that you're

544
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
There's not one way to do a great career

545
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Let's talk about artificial intelligence

546
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:03,800
And I use this image for the simple reason that it's it is the reason that we think about AI the way we think about it

547
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,160
It's terrible term

548
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,840
It was coined in the 1950s by a guy named Marvin Minsky when he's trying to sell stuff to the US military

549
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,560
The first time regular humans heard the phrase artificial intelligence. It was in the movie

550
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,120
2001 a space Odyssey and Hal and then he tried to kill everybody and

551
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Set up our relationship with artificial intelligence going forward

552
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,440
It's an umbrella term the one thing I know for sure about artificial intelligence is as long as somebody's calling something artificial intelligence

553
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,120
It's because it doesn't work as soon as it does work. It gets a new name

554
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,720
right it becomes deep learning a predictive analytics or

555
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,560
You know to speech tech systems as long as it doesn't work. It's AI and

556
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,080
And so when folks talk to me about hey, you know, I'm working on this AI problem

557
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,920
It's like, what are you really working on? Like is it a machine learning model? That's the new thing, right?

558
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
Like really what really came out of

559
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,960
Jeff Hinton's papers in 2011 that led to stuff like Siri and all the voice recognition and ultimately these vision

560
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,280
Interpretation models is all deep learning models based on machine learning, right?

561
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,160
Then this particular graphic I like because the short lines are

562
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,480
The oldest technologies that those planning schedule optimization. Those are back in the 50s

563
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,720
experts and robotics from the 1970s original speech recognition systems go back to the 80s and then in the 2010s

564
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,680
We get this current crop of image recognition vision systems language interpretation

565
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,080
And we can incorporate that is our software today. There are good libraries. You don't have to invent stuff

566
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,600
It isn't research anymore. You want an image recognition module? It's a module. You load it into your software

567
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,600
You have an image to be recognized and it can recognize it

568
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,000
This is a real thing the software was doing what you told it to do said, oh, no, no three dogs

569
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,080
And you've run into the chatbots, right? They're out there

570
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:06,120
You they're first-line tech support for almost everything today. You're gonna get a chat bot for us and sometimes they're speech bots

571
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:14,760
And they're they are getting better. There's mean. They're good. We all learned to say agent very early on if we want to get out of that loop

572
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:24,020
These are again tooling sets that we can work with the area that I I'm really fascinated by right now that Microsoft's working on are these form

573
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
recognizers

574
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,160
So the idea that I can I can use an image recognition system look at a form and it recognizes

575
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,120
What is form and what is data and then associates the two together into?

576
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,520
Value pairs

577
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:44,000
That's pretty cool, right that we had a different strategy to digitizing a form rather than building it by hand in

578
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,440
In code that now the tool would actually recognize before you generate for you

579
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,480
I

580
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,480
This was really about using initially paper because they call it a form recognizer

581
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,160
Like can I parse a page and have it pull the data out of it?

582
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,200
But I immediately thought hey aim that in a at a web forms page and re reimparse it for me

583
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
And make it into power platform stuff

584
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,480
Like can you could I just have a tool thumb through all of the different views and an application and regenerate it in the new language?

585
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,080
Why not we have machine learning models that are capable of parsing the data

586
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,400
The final area in the machine learning spaces that has gotten powerful actually has been powerful a while and when people are asking about

587
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,040
Hey, my kids getting into technology like where's the big career opportunity? It's analyzing data

588
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,800
We have more data than ever before we're analyzing it

589
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,800
Less and less effectively because we're just outnumbered. There's so much data and only so much time

590
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,800
The good news is the cloud is making things simpler for us in the 90s

591
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,000
We had most of these predictive analytic models

592
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It's just that each one of them represented a huge amount of compute

593
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,600
And so you'd do a bunch of pre-work to figure out what the most likely

594
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:56,440
Analytic model will be effective on this given data, and then you'd build out a system and run it once and it would take weeks

595
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,240
Today, this is a couple of hours in Azure load the date

596
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,080
You'll spend more time loading the data up then you'll run all of the predicted analytic models

597
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,280
And then you'll run model analysis against the models to figure out the one that fits the data set best

598
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,120
For $20 for the computer

599
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:21,160
So we have better tools than ever for doing advanced analytics and as we go and when we talk about as advanced analytics, you know the predictive model

600
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,720
Is really what's the next number that's going to come from this?

601
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,480
What's the trend on these is just going up as it's going down, right?

602
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,440
We have plenty of tools and those sorts of forms as we start adding in machine learning we do it in bulk

603
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:38,480
We're able to do more of them faster and compare them so that we can select models more efficiently

604
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,240
It's less time or your space and more just hammer it with compute, but you can go to a more advanced stage

605
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,400
Given you take a predictive model, and it says this is the most likely outcome

606
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,800
Now you can actually run a scenario beyond that you're getting into prescriptive analytics

607
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,400
So you're cycling the predictive model with actions

608
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,240
You've been experienced. This is where you know it or not. Have you lately?

609
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,040
thrown a bunch of stuff in a shopping cart and abandoned it and then you get an email from someone saying hey

610
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
You put this stuff in your cart

611
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,480
Like can I give you a 10% off so you'll go buy it?

612
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:15,760
You're seeing a prescriptive model saying how often do I tickle this person now that they've shown some interest to increase the

613
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,880
Likelihood of completing a sale. There's no humans involved. It's all software

614
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,320
But they're now running these prescriptive explorers to say how often should I hit them?

615
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:31,560
But given a thousand people did that and I emailed them this way. What was the response rate?

616
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,240
Whatever you mail in this way. What's the response rate? That's automated now that is prescriptive analytic models

617
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,240
Now obviously in the e-commerce sale is one side, but you're also seeing the same models used for things like when should you?

618
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,760
Evacuate a town for a forest fire

619
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,320
If I wait till it's obvious that the fire is going to hit the town now

620
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,920
I risk people's health in the crisis of trying to get them out

621
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,880
Or is it better at a low stress level to say let's move them early?

622
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,880
It'll cost us less the chance of them being injured killed is lower and

623
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,480
Then if the fire goes the other way, it's not that big of a deal, right?

624
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,920
We're still building prescriptive models to explore the psychological effects of emergencies and

625
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,960
Being able to act more effectively to protect people

626
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
We can also make video games

627
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,720
So this is one of the open AI models

628
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,320
In the early days where you would describe a game

629
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,240
This is someone making a bad version of asteroids and it would spit out code for you

630
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:36,280
This is not that exciting anymore. Most people have played hopefully with co-pilot now a whole other way to pull up code

631
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,920
You don't understand you so have to use stackover flow for this

632
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,840
But now you can do a machine learning model. So there's fewer people saying that's a dumb question

633
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,640
I'm concerned with the training set

634
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,480
We've done a couple of great shows around this with folks like Michelle Manning where we you know

635
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,120
It's maybe generating code that works, but isn't secure or isn't you know reliable

636
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,320
They've trained it against all of the open libraries on GitHub and that doesn't mean that means it's only as good as the code

637
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,760
That we put into GitHub some of the code I put in the GitHub. I'm not proud of

638
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:15,080
So it is interesting to say how can they improve this to say hey, I only want highly secure code

639
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,320
That's thoughtful of all of those kinds of things. They're now starting to stick language onto this

640
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,400
So now you're gonna talk about what code you want to write and

641
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:30,560
The VP of the power platform Charles Lamanna announced they've not made a version of co-pilot for power platform

642
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:38,440
So, oh you had a no-code solution where you're draggy dropping the form too much work. Just say make me a form

643
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,920
All right now use the image recognizer show them a copy of the paper version before and it comes up

644
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:53,840
So those are machine learning models for programming. There are tools for us to use the whole we will all be replaced by this is

645
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,800
Silly it always was silly. It's only getting sillier the longer we use these things

646
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,600
But if you don't use them in your routine work, you kind of miss it out. It's an accelerant

647
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,080
There's no excuse for not understanding the code. You're putting your system

648
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,440
So the idea that this is an you're already you were using Google sometimes you're using stack overflow

649
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,720
Why wouldn't you use co-pilot to pull up code and then evaluate that code? It's easier than a blank screen

650
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:24,200
It's at all anything we can do to get ourselves moving on a given problem space, but it's still our discrimination

651
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,720
The tool does not know that this code is right all it knows it is it fit the criteria you described to it at the time

652
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,000
That's as much as know with some percentage of probability

653
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,360
hopefully in the high 90s, but not always and

654
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:46,240
Chat GPT about the same thing right there. I call it a Dunning Kruger accelerator

655
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,440
If you know nothing about a topic chat GPT is awesome

656
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,040
As soon as you know something about a topic and ask chat GDP it's not that awesome

657
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Not actually concerned with facts

658
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,960
What replaces the smartphone?

659
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,240
I mean the smartphone is dominated. It's not the primary computer device, but it's kind of mature

660
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,160
you know

661
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,600
The phones get bigger they get smaller they have one camera two cameras three cameras way too many cameras

662
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,800
But they're kind of the same. They're a slab of black glass

663
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,880
We're kind of ripe for disintermediation the obvious devices some kind of AR headset

664
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,400
Right is some pair of glasses that we can put on that puts the data directly to our eyes

665
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,320
It does everything the phone does without having to pull it out

666
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,840
All right, and actually gives us a bunch of other capabilities because now we have instrumentation on our heads

667
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,280
so that it can observe the world around us because we're not paying attention and

668
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,960
That offers a bunch of possibilities that being said 2023 not a good year for AR

669
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,520
Apple's just announced. This is a mock-up of what we thought Apple was going to make

670
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,400
It's all a lie and it currently Apple says they're not making anything they've backed off

671
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,100
So whatever prototypes they were working on internally, they're not happy with them right now

672
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,760
There are commercial products that are glasses with devices on it

673
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,760
This is a Qualcomm device called the XR1 you can buy this today. It's about thousand bucks tethered to an Android phone

674
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,800
And it's just a USB headset that has microphones and speakers and cameras and and

675
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,440
And screens integrated into it and you're seeing these used in certain commercial applications

676
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,200
If you want to look more like Google Glass, you can do this with the Toshiba devices. This is the Dyna edge

677
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,420
So I want one eye a little more industrial looking

678
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,600
Okay, this hardware exists. There is HoloLens, but HoloLens is not in a good place

679
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,600
If I was this is the tremble version of HoloLens 2

680
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,720
This is the one they wanted to put on all construction workers because construction workers are good with equipment

681
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,800
at

682
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,120
3000 bucks a piece plus about a thousand dollars a month in operating costs

683
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,960
When I when we started doing some case studies on implied HoloLens products

684
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,340
I was stunned at how much Azure eats to operate it properly like

685
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,000
Now for certain markets that makes perfect sense construction site not so much

686
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:02,680
But if you've been paying attention to the recent round of layoffs, you know, they've pretty much laid off the entire HoloLens team

687
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,480
The leader of the HoloLens team a guy named Alex Kipman left Microsoft back in July

688
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,040
So they've been a little bit leaderless for the past few years and the army announced they shut down there

689
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,680
They were gonna shut down a project. They want to do more research on it and then these round of layoffs came

690
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,440
So it looks like the HoloLens is an orphan for the moment

691
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,680
I mean the the opportunity in certain verticals is really interesting the you know industrial applications where

692
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,280
Basically equipment becomes transparent checklists are live

693
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:35,640
You're making continuous video record of the maintenance that you're doing. These are all interesting applied cases

694
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,640
I looked at this very much as the

695
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,800
That the AR glasses were in the same place that the BlackBerry phone was in like the 1990s

696
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:49,320
In the 90s if you want an email on your phone, I know crazy

697
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,400
You had to buy these a thousand dollar phones in the 90s

698
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:01,320
From from rim called the BlackBerry and had a little keyboard on it and you had to run a custom version of exchange server

699
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,360
inside of your organization to make it work

700
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,960
So you need a couple of guys in lab coats and

701
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:14,560
A whole ton of licenses and you too could have email on your phone and it was so popular in the 90s

702
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,560
They called them crackberries

703
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,800
But it needed to be the right vertical it needed that cost had to be worthwhile that continuous access that person was important enough

704
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,400
Right, you saw it on like the West Wing right the politicians and bureaucrats needed this sort of thing

705
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,320
And of course today emails been completely

706
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,680
Commercialized it's in every device. It's not a big deal

707
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,320
But I look at HoloLens and the AR devices that way for the right vertical where you can afford that

708
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,560
Expend is trivial to its value totally makes sense consumer device. No, not there yet

709
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:51,440
And we don't know when we will be it's an insanely complex device now the HoloLens 2 is six years old

710
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:57,320
We never saw the HoloLens 3 so the tick tock of Moore's law still applying

711
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,200
We should be able to get dramatically better headset. We're just struggling for the applications for it

712
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:10,680
I'll make fun of meta very briefly. It's not hard to do anymore. It was funnier a couple of years ago. I

713
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,240
We would have said hey Zuckerberg created the largest loss of value in all time

714
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,960
He burned through ten billion dollars in a year, but then I

715
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:29,000
Mean Facebook was a trillion dollar company now. It's a 300 billion dollar company well done

716
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,200
But then you know, let's look at Twitter or Tesla

717
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,800
My billionaires messing up their companies seems to be a style. I presume it will pass

718
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,240
These headsets are compelling

719
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:51,120
This was really John Carmack the guy behind Oculus that got acquired by Facebook who has now put down his his laptop

720
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,160
I go, okay, I've had enough you people and he's left now to so any sense

721
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,960
That Facebook's along between Cheryl Samberg leaving and Asia and and and Carmack leaving

722
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,760
Zucks by himself and I think fairly far off the rails

723
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,720
Microsoft seemed to be playing ball

724
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:14,240
They they wanted a team's version of this with the new the quest pro the $1,500 headset in the horizon workspace

725
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,040
They've now backed away from this. So this is kind of a dark time in general

726
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,440
We're kind of it for AR and VR if you are interested in developing in the space

727
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:30,280
The obvious tool is unity like the bulk of development being done in the space is done in unity. It's C sharp centric

728
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,880
It's its own custom build essentially if you've never played with this is it's an experience

729
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,640
And I recommend the tool often to kids who think they want to make games

730
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,560
Because you can do a few watch a few videos use the free version of unity and you can do a lot

731
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:50,840
You can make a pretty basic straightforward side scroll and have an experience and then start to think more profoundly about the challenges of writing games

732
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,960
But a lot they but unity has going forward is a really good set of 3d libraries

733
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,680
For making it easy to do all of that three-dimensional work

734
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Okay, one last topic and then we'll wrap up

735
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:08,080
Quantum computing because people love it. So quantum computing is a kind of super computing

736
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,720
It's not likely to be a regular general-purpose compute. It's for super compute problems

737
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:19,160
So the same way that we build these titanic supercomputers for modeling weather and things these are the kinds of problems basis

738
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,880
The quantum computers good for that

739
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,320
There are a number of companies that are building a variety of different styles of quantum computers

740
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,720
This to me likens very much to the late 40s early 50s in

741
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:38,000
General computing before the development of the of silicon

742
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:45,000
So every computer is kind of bespoke. This the sycamore computer built by Google. It has 54 qubits

743
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It was the first to achieve quantum supremacy where it worked on a particular problem

744
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,640
That was considered thousands of years of compute in traditional computing

745
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,800
That's questionable. My favorite part of that story was it's a 54 bit computer quantum computer

746
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,040
Except one of the bits was broken on performance day. So it was a 53 cubit cubit run

747
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,080
this particular design of quantum computers is what they call

748
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,680
Transmon quantum processing. So this is kind of this is a way of doing quantum entanglement with ultra-cooled

749
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,640
Material they cool in the liquid helium

750
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,480
Which is dangerous

751
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,480
The Chinese have a photonic quantum computer. They had up and running in about 2020 with a hundred and 13 entangled qubits

752
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:36,200
They did a Bose's sampling compute in 200 seconds. That would have been multi-billion years of traditional compute

753
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,160
It was a known problem. It's kind of a proof point. But again, these are

754
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:47,960
Getting there and then IBM's Eagle and Osprey and Condor architectures

755
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,840
in the hundred to

756
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,440
120 or so qubits that one was in benchmarking in 20 late 2021 2022

757
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:02,840
We haven't seen the results from it yet. They were promising by last year to have a 400 qubit

758
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:09,920
Processor that hasn't materialized yet and this was supposed to be the year they produced a thousand qubits that hasn't happened either

759
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,480
The real question is what the hell are you going to do with this thing?

760
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,560
Like the only thing ever here on the news

761
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,800
This is the end of security that we're going to be able to break our say encryption

762
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,440
Which is true?

763
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,640
Kinda in the end encryption strategies that use prime number very these very large prime numbers are

764
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:33,080
susceptible to the compute strengths of quantum computer if you have four or five thousand entangled qubits

765
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,080
You should be able to crush through 128 digit primes in a matter of seconds

766
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,080
We don't have to use

767
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,720
Prime based encryption there are other kinds of encryption in fact and the NSA is currently recommending that we switch to a lattice based

768
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,720
Encryption, it's just not as efficient to encrypt with other kinds of encryption strategies

769
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,960
It turns out the computers are good at prime numbers as a cost effective ways to do encryption as well as decryption

770
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,720
So forget the encryption problem solvable not interesting

771
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:08,040
The most interesting problems in the quantum computing space are actually chemistry problems and the classic one for me is in agriculture

772
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:15,960
So in the pre technological era if you wanted to grow crops routinely if you were planting wheat

773
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,680
If you kept growing wheat in the same chunk of land year over year

774
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,640
You got less and less wheat because you depleted the soil you had to rejuvenate the soil now today in an industrial world

775
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:31,600
We have the Hayrabash process where we make industrial fertilizers and after you have a season of growing wheat

776
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:37,120
You then fertilize the stod out of that land and repopulate that replenish the soil to grow wheat again

777
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:44,960
But before we had that we rotated crops and there are bean plants typically that has a rhizome on it

778
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:51,200
That lives on the roots and inside of that is an enzyme called nitrogenase and nitrogenase

779
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:59,360
Naturally affixes nitrogen it takes water and night from and what and nitrogen from the air and in a catalytic reaction

780
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,920
Turns it into ammonia so in the normal crop rotation you would grow a crop of beans

781
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,840
You would harvest the beans you plow the plants under and then you let the land go fallow for a year

782
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:17,080
You let those roots rot and they were to release fertilizers back into the soil and then the third year you can plant wheat again

783
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:23,440
That's the traditional non-technical way to do it chemical fertilizers avoided that but chemical fertilizers have their own cost

784
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,960
They're about 1% of the energy consumption of this planet is based on making and distributing fertilizers

785
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,200
So if we could utilize this thing that a bean plant could do

786
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,240
We could have a significant impact on agriculture

787
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,160
The problem is that the catalytic reaction that goes on inside of that enzyme

788
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,840
involves atoms of molybdenum and iron and it's a 2 to the

789
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:54,280
170th complex problem to understand the electron interaction, which is like more atoms that are on the than they're on the earth a

790
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:02,920
Midsize quantum computer something in the 400 qubit range should be able to solve this should give us an example

791
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,640
Of the correct catalytic reaction that doesn't mean we'll immediately be able to implement it

792
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,560
But once you know what the reaction looks like you have a chance of now engineering and implementation of it

793
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:17,960
So that we could be making fertilizer directly from air at low power plant power

794
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,080
And be able to grow food more routinely. It's an interesting quantum problem

795
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,840
There are other quantum chemistry problems like that battery design is largely based on experimentation

796
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:33,160
Not on our actual understanding of the interactions of the compounds what we have done in battery

797
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:39,120
Development today has gotten really good at iterating on trying different combinations not actually understanding the optimal combination

798
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,120
It's a quantum computing problem

799
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:48,080
Modern superconductors the Rebco superconductors, which are made from rare earth materials and barium cupric oxide are

800
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:56,240
ceramics that are superconductive at liquid nitrogen temperatures as opposed to niobium Tim, which is superconducting at helium temperatures

801
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,680
Which is way harder to deal with we've had these superconductors for about 40 years

802
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,040
We just don't really understand how they work and

803
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,280
So it's hard to make better ones and again quantum computer quantum chemistry problem

804
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,240
These are all deterministic problems so the real question is how many quantum computers do we need?

805
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,440
Because once you've solved it you kind of need to solve it again, right?

806
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,760
It's not a non deterministic problem where you need to do it every time like a weather problem

807
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,920
It's just a deterministic problem and it reminds me of of

808
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,080
of

809
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:33,280
Thomas Watson's statement when they were first building mechanical mainframes for the original version of IBM where he told his board

810
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,040
I think there's only a market for like five of these and then they went out selling and they sold like 25

811
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,240
And it was a revelation, but that was because back then the computer looked like this

812
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,520
Right, this is before

813
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,840
Intel this is before

814
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,240
The silicon transistor you've your computer looks like this

815
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,840
You can't envision a smartphone like you can't see it from there. It's it's too hard

816
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,360
The first transistor ever made may in Bell Labs the geranium transistor looked like this

817
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:08,240
It's pretty hard to look at that and mink M1 chip

818
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,760
All right, it's a big jump

819
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,560
So going back to that mainframe

820
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,760
What made

821
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:24,440
Traditional computing useful was the integrated circuit. We suddenly had a stable reliable way to make bits

822
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:30,120
We made RAM and then we made processes for them. They were consistent and we could scale them and Moore's law took over

823
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:35,560
We got more and more potential compute. I described to you three different kinds of quantum computers today

824
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:39,000
They were all radically different because there's not a good qubit yet

825
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,520
Everybody's trying to make the right qubit. They're exploring their quantum computers are very

826
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:48,960
Much like these bespoke general computers from the 40s and 50s

827
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,040
And maybe that's what it's gonna take the my favorite story of this whole thing is the guy one of the guys who made this transistor

828
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,040
Guy named William Shockley

829
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,680
He was also the guy who who then created a company called Fairchild summer conductor

830
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,280
And he tried to make and he made the first integrated circuits

831
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:10,760
And when he was trying to figure out the chemo the chemistry was gonna need to dope it properly and what the ratio should be and so

832
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,760
forth he used an old-style mechanical mainframe to do the computation and

833
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,960
That gave him the models to be able to build the first integrated circuits that made far more reliable general-purpose computers

834
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,400
I wonder if these flaky goofy

835
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:31,720
Unreliable quantum computers are building today or the compute devices will need to find the reliable qubit. I

836
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,960
Don't know the answer to that, but I like how the history rhymes. I do know this

837
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:44,480
We're trying to predict the future the best way to do it is to make it and that's us we do this

838
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,920
We're going to go out and do some work

839
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,080
We're these next couple of days

840
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:54,280
We're gonna do a bunch of learning and we're gonna create the future and I can't wait to see what we make. Thank you for your time
