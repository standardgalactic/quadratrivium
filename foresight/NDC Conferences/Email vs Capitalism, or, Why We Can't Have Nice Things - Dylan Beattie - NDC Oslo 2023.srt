00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, NDC Oslo.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm Dylan, I'm going to talk to you about email because email is kind of important, right?

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,960
You ever get the thing where you can't remember your password?

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,320
So you click forgotten password, they send you an email.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,600
You get locked out of your account, you click the button, they send you an email, you want

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
to go to sign into Microsoft Azure and they say, hang on, we just need to check, it's

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,680
really you.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,240
How do they check it's really you?

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,320
They send you an email.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,160
You sign up on a new service, they're like, we want to make sure that you're not a spam

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,680
bot or some kind of, you know, evil nefarious internet criminal overload, we're going to

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,680
send you an email and you can use the email to verify it.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,080
So email is a really, really important component in the fact that any of the stuff that we

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,020
do online ever actually works at all.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,720
So we're going to do a little experiment.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,120
We're going to go here.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,800
Now what I'd like all of you to do, you're going to go to that web address and you are

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,120
going to follow the instructions.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,240
Now there is a button that's going to appear on your phone screen that says, don't press

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,600
this button yet.

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you know what that means?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,800
There is a saying that if they wrote on a button, do not press this button or it will

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,760
destroy the universe, the paint would not be dry before a human being had slapped the

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,240
button.

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,840
Do not press the button.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,800
What I want you to do is to follow the instructions on the screen.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,160
There we go.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,760
Let's bring up our live update.

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Someone has matched the button.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,080
That little yellow at sign there, that's somebody who can't read the documentation.

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,240
And it's written in large, friendly letters.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,160
How evil can it be?

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,560
So we're going to just let that rack up a little bit.

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,920
Look at that.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Look at that.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,160
Someone has already caused an error message.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,560
Well done.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Congratulations.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
There we go.

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Look at that.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go through the process.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
Most of you, it's good to see every little white dot on that, that's someone who is following

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
the instructions.

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Now we have to press the button.

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
No.

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Wait.

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
We have to stand up.

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Wait.

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
No.

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
No.

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
No.

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
No.

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
No.

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
No.

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Stand up.

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
The instructions say you stand up.

57
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
So you stand up.

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,840
Stand up.

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Stand up.

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Stand up.

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Stand up.

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Stand up.

63
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Stand up.

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Everyone standing up.

65
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Standing up.

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Right.

67
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,280
So what we're going to do, I'm going to count down from five, and when you get to zero, you're

68
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,960
allowed to press the button.

69
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:42,720
Five, four, three, two, one, press the button, and we're going to send you an email.

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,360
And when we do, you are going to go and check your inbox, and when you get the email, follow

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:56,880
the instructions in the email.

72
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
All right.

73
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
I see a couple going green.

74
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
I see a couple going pink.

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,280
Some of the stuff is getting through.

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,640
Some of the stuff is going to junk mail.

77
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,800
Some of it is still queued.

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
Some of it is still sent.

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,280
The little black ones there are probably because I've pissed off every email provider on the

80
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,200
planet doing the research for this talk, and some of them have decided that they are just

81
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,680
not going to talk to me anymore.

82
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,080
Are we getting a fair few of those going through?

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,400
Now it's around about now that you've been waiting long enough that if this email was

84
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,720
like your two-factor authentication to get into Azure to fix a problem in production

85
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,520
or the password reset so you can get into your Gmail to get your damn plane ticket because

86
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,560
you need to get to the airport, you'd be getting a little like, why does an email work this

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
should have arrived by now?

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
Well, friends, I have some very distressing news for you.

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,080
Everything is working absolutely fine.

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
Those of you who are still standing up, bear with me one more second.

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
This is the SMTP specification, the latest version, October 2008, about how we should

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,160
try to deliver email, and what it says is if it doesn't work first time, you should wait

93
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:09,600
at least 30 minutes, and then you should keep trying for four or five days before you finally

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,560
decide that the email didn't work.

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,000
Now anyone who didn't get the email, you are welcome to come down the front at the

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,740
end and you can get one of these, the sticker that should have been an email that I've got

97
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,400
some of these printed out here, saying take all of those.

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,640
These are the special NDC Oslo editions of this, so they won't look like this ever again.

99
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,680
Now I'm going to talk to you about email and I'm going to talk to you about why we have

100
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,520
ended up with this weird situation where the spec says that an email can take five days,

101
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,240
but we built the internet on the fact it takes about 15 seconds.

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
How did we get here?

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,800
My credibility, I guess, my expertise in the field of email, it's something I've been

104
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,360
working with for my entire career.

105
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,800
In 2002, when the internet had a connection wizard, one of my first big professional projects

106
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,200
I ever worked on was a project for this company, Spotlight is a British directory of show business

107
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,840
job opportunities for actors and actresses, all those kinds of things.

108
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,280
I built an email-based job information service.

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,760
If you were making a movie and you needed actors to be in your movie, you could go on

110
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,480
Spotlight and you could send out an email.

111
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,120
Now this was built in classic ASP and I had a for loop and what it would do is it would

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,920
send an email and then it would response.write a dot.

113
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,440
So you'd get a screen that went dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, and then at the end

114
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,720
we'd response.flash and we'd redirect.

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,040
It sent about 200 emails a day, it was clunky as hell, but the system before that was built

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,800
on fax machines.

117
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,120
So this was a pretty neat idea.

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,920
It was also a spectacularly successful product.

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,800
It went from 200 emails a day to 500 to 1,000 to 2,000 to 5,000.

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,360
By the time I left Spotlight in 2018, this system was sending a quarter of a million

121
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
emails out every day.

122
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,880
And that's not a quarter of a million copies of the same newsletter, it's a quarter of

123
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,320
a million unique individual personalized emails.

124
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Now there was an interesting phenomenon that we noticed.

125
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,280
We catered mainly to the English speaking show business market.

126
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,040
In London, about two o'clock every afternoon, show business would get back from its nice

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,320
boozy lunch in the pub, sit down and go, I should probably send out some emails.

128
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,560
What do you think, Brian?

129
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,760
And they'd go on Spotlight, they'd bang in a couple of things, they'd send us out.

130
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,920
This happened at the same time as New York and Broadway had just finished their latte

131
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,360
and were getting ready to get set into a solid day's work, which was the same time that Hollywood

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,960
and Los Angeles have finished their power breakfast and started yelling at their assistants.

133
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,160
So when I say a quarter of a million emails a day, most of them went out in a three hour

134
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,040
window every afternoon.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,440
That is a sustained rate of about 10 to 12 emails per second for three hours every week

136
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
day for more than a decade.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,280
Now you probably have a picture in your head of what a professional actor looks like.

138
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,400
Most of them don't look like the ones you see on TV.

139
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,720
The ones you see on TV are the ones who have made it because they have a job right now.

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,680
The average professional actor looks like this because they're at home waiting for their

141
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,040
next audition and they are sitting there and they're refreshing their email.

142
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,480
Now some of you might have had complaints like companies you worked at where you've sent

143
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,640
email and people have complained that you've sent them email.

144
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,600
Have you ever had someone to phone you to complain that you hadn't sent them email?

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,160
Because we used to get people ringing out going, I haven't had any emails for a couple

146
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
of hours.

147
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Is everything all right?

148
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,360
And we'd be like, well, we think so.

149
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Maybe there's just no work for you today.

150
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,040
But we had to answer those calls and we had to be able to explain what was going on.

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,160
So my team and I got incredibly good at understanding everything there was to know about email delivery.

152
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
How does it work?

153
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Why does it work?

154
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Why might it fail?

155
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Now the whole time this is going on, because I'm an idiot, I'm running an open source mail

156
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,640
server for me and all of my friends.

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,960
So DylanBT.net, all the email ran on an old Hewlett Packard workstation that was locked

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,920
in a server cupboard somewhere for about 10 or 15 years.

159
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,520
Now I eventually stopped doing that and you'll find out why in the course of the talk.

160
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,600
But then at the start of this year, who was at NDC London?

161
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,480
I was, yeah.

162
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,760
Some people who very nearly weren't were people who worked for a company I won't name whose

163
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,400
corporate email provider switched to a new spam filtering service the week before the

164
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,960
conference and that spam filtering service, MimeCast, decided that SendGrid was sending

165
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
junk.

166
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,920
And so all of their NDC conference tickets went to junk and we had to kind of jump in

167
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,360
and figure out how did these people not get the tickets they'd paid money for that were

168
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,200
sent directly to them.

169
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
And I thought there might be an interesting talk in this, because lots of us build systems

170
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,240
that send email and lots of us don't really understand all the weird quirks of how it

171
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
works.

172
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,440
So email is older than networks.

173
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,240
The first computer that kind of really got any kind of traction was this thing, the compatible

174
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,800
time sharing systems, about 1961.

175
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,720
And you could send mail on this thing, but send as a misnomer because when you sent mail,

176
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,640
the mail didn't go anywhere.

177
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,400
It was the equivalent of leaving post-it notes on a really expensive refrigerator because

178
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,240
this computer was shared between 60 or 70 different researchers.

179
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,000
So when your colleague came to work the next morning and logged into their terminal, you'd

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
left them a note.

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,520
That was the first use of electronic mail.

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,560
This kind of went on for a couple of years and we're going to skip forward to 1969.

183
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,360
Now if the United States of America was a Netflix show, 1969 would be a season finale.

184
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Big budget.

185
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
They pulled out all the stops.

186
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,760
They did lots of really interesting stuff.

187
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,160
69 was the year that people walked on the moon.

188
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,440
It was the year the Boeing 747 first flew.

189
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,000
It was the year the Lockheed SR-71 first flew.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,640
It was the year of Woodstock and the summer of love, all that kind of stuff.

191
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,440
And it was the year that the ARPANET was invented.

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,880
Now there were networks before the ARPANET.

193
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,360
The ARPANET was the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network and it looked like this.

194
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,120
This is a hand-drawn sketch of the entire network.

195
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,840
Now before this, there was a network, but it was a kind of ad hoc network of computers

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,120
that would dial each other up once or twice a day and they'd swap messages and things.

197
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,040
But when the ARPANET came along, for the first time, there was an idea of being connected

198
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,080
to the net.

199
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,240
This was the network and if you were on it, other people could send messages to you.

200
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,920
Now modern email is a culmination of probably hundreds of people working on solving smart

201
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,960
problems over decades on all kinds of platforms.

202
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,360
But one person whose innovation is still a significant part of the way we work with it

203
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
was this guy.

204
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
It's Ray Tomlinson.

205
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,960
And he was working on an ARPANET mail system in 1971 and Ray invented AT.

206
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,440
Ray is the person who went, hang on, if we know the user's name and we know the ARPANET

207
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,400
host where they host their email, we could put an AT in the middle because it's Alice

208
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
at the machine.

209
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,520
Now you'll notice that the host name there is just MIT Multics.

210
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,680
It's not a dot anything.

211
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,520
It's not MITMultics.com, it's just MIT Multics.

212
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,400
Because the network was so small that computers just had a name.

213
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,920
And if you bought a new computer, you wanted to get on the net, you'd give it a name and

214
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,640
then you'd talk to Jake.

215
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,400
This is Elizabeth Feynler who everyone called Jake for some obscure reason.

216
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,680
She ran the network information center at Stanford from 1972 to 1988 and she maintained

217
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,720
the host's file.

218
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,440
The definitive host's file of the entire internet and every year or two she and her

219
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,880
team would print it because you could buy a print out of the host's file.

220
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,640
And this listed all of the machines connected to the ARPANET along with the person responsible

221
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,880
for maintaining them, telephone numbers, street addresses and email addresses.

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,320
Now there are two kinds of people in the world.

223
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,800
There are the people who see technology and go, hey, this is really useful.

224
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,160
And there are the people who go, hey, those people think this is useful, maybe I can use

225
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,680
it to get rich.

226
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,240
Let's meet Gary Turk.

227
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,200
Now Gary Turk, I punched his name in a Google to find a photo.

228
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,280
The guy's still alive, he's still working, this is his LinkedIn page.

229
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,160
You could connect with him after this talk if you really wanted to.

230
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,560
But in 1978, Gary Turk was working for the Digital Equipment Corporation.

231
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,320
He was a sales rep and his job was to sell these, the DEC System 20.

232
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,440
Now this thing had built in ARPANET protocol support.

233
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,080
It was like you didn't have to do anything special, you could plug it into a network

234
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,640
and it would just work.

235
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,760
And rightly or wrongly, Gary thought, well, I reckon people who are on the ARPANET might

236
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,440
be interested in knowing about this computer.

237
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,080
And Digital didn't have a whole lot of sales going on on the US West Coast.

238
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,480
They had a big office on the East Coast, but West Coast, California, Portland, those kind

239
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,400
of places, they didn't really have much of a presence.

240
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,960
So he got his assistant to go through the ARPANET directory and type in the email addresses

241
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:59,520
of everybody on the American West Coast who had an email address, 393 of them.

242
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,560
And put them, now at this point, they overflowed the header field.

243
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,240
So all the people who got this email got an email which started with about 250 other

244
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,080
people's email addresses and then right down at the end of it, it says, hey, we invite

245
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,560
you to come and see the DEC System 2020 and we'll be giving presentations.

246
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,000
Now has any of you ever gotten trouble at work?

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,200
Like maybe your boss said, please don't do that again.

248
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Or maybe your boss shouted at you.

249
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,560
Or maybe the police shouted at you.

250
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,280
Or maybe the police shouted at your boss.

251
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,760
Have us grow up so bad that the United States military yells at your boss?

252
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,440
Because that's what happened.

253
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,040
Major Raymond Chehor, who was the US Air Force major in charge of the ARPANET, because this

254
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,560
was run by the United States Air Force, you know, US military project, basically called

255
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,040
Gary's boss and said, you do not do this ever again.

256
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,200
We're very sorry.

257
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,600
Now there's maybe a little window right about then when we could have fixed the problem.

258
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,520
But everyone just went, yeah, don't send spam or the American Air Force will shout at you.

259
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
We're clear.

260
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,880
And everyone went, yeah, we understand.

261
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
We'll be good from now on.

262
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
We'll be nice.

263
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
We'll behave.

264
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,000
We're going to fast forward a little bit now.

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,640
Now, you know, that demographic studies of populations kind of, they group people into

266
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
generations.

267
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
There are the baby boomers.

268
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,040
And then there's, there's Generation X. And then there are the millennials.

269
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,680
And then there's Generation Z. And then there's Gen Alpha or whatever they're called, and

270
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
the new one.

271
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,440
And there's this little gap in the middle, the microgeneration.

272
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,320
We're the people who got email at the same time as everyone else in the world got email

273
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
for the first time.

274
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,960
Now, if you are Generation X, it means you were born before Star Wars.

275
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,760
And if you are millennial, it means you were born after Return of the Jedi.

276
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,680
And the people in the middle are the millennial Falcons.

277
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Represent.

278
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
How many of my fellow Falcons we got out there today?

279
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
Awesome.

280
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,080
Now, the millennial, it was kind of this weird microgeneration.

281
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,360
We're the ones who like grew up in a world where we had broadcast TV and our first job

282
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
we had email.

283
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,160
So we kind of had the analog childhood and then our adulthood has been completely digital.

284
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,120
But it turns out that the internet is a millennial falcon.

285
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,440
Because when Star Wars came out in 1977, there was the ARPANET.

286
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,320
It used NCP, the network communication protocol.

287
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,040
Everything was managed by the host's file, which you had to go and get a copy of from

288
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,640
Stanford University.

289
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,920
And Junk Mail didn't exist.

290
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
No one had done that yet.

291
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,120
When Return of the Jedi came out in May 1983, the ARPANET had become the internet.

292
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,440
NCP was gone.

293
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,920
TCPIP was everywhere.

294
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,160
We're all running on this.

295
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,560
DNS had been invented.

296
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,520
We had a hierarchical domain name addressing system.

297
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,280
And Junk email was very much a thing.

298
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,800
Now, one of the things invented in the early 80s there was SMTP.

299
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,240
It was created by this guy, John Postel.

300
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,920
SMTP was published in 1982 and has been incredibly successful.

301
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,800
Now, the problem with successful systems is you need to maintain an obscene level of backwards

302
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
compatibility.

303
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,240
If you bring out an email system at any point in the last 40 years that doesn't talk to

304
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,200
all the other people who are already using email, no one's going to use it.

305
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,520
Because it's useless because you can't communicate.

306
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:21,040
It is the equivalent of going out and buying a 2022 MacBook M1 or M2 Pro and finding that

307
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,440
it has a cassette player so that you can still load your PowerPoint slides from 1982.

308
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,680
This is how backwards compatible SMTP systems and relays have to be.

309
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,120
And one of the things defined in that request for comments, RFC821, was the format of an

310
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
email address.

311
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,000
Now, quick show of hands.

312
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,600
Who's written code to validate email addresses?

313
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,320
Keep your hands up if you used a regular expression.

314
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Yeah.

315
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,560
So, I mean, validating the encoders kind of, but we know an email address when we see

316
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
one, right?

317
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,000
Like, we're looking at our friends in the Avengers.

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
We got IronMan at Avengers.com.

319
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
That looks valid, right?

320
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,200
And Spider-Man, well, yeah, that's probably going to work.

321
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,520
T'Challa at the Avengers.com.

322
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,760
That's going to root, obviously.

323
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,640
Nothing wrong with that.

324
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Rocket plus Groot.

325
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm not sure now.

326
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,600
What about Bruce the Hulk banner at Avengers.com?

327
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,200
What about, no, Vision doesn't give a shit about DNS, Vision's going to use IPv6, hard

328
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,800
coded literals in square brackets, boom.

329
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,320
How many of these would your email validation routine have accepted?

330
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,520
They are all valid.

331
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,640
These addresses are all completely valid email addresses according to the RFC specification

332
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,440
for internet email addresses.

333
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,720
So maybe validity is not really the question we should be asking ourselves.

334
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,040
We're going to pull some email addresses apart and see how they actually work.

335
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,000
Now, an email address has a domain part, and this controls where it's going.

336
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,440
And it has a local part that controls what happens when it gets there.

337
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,840
So what we're going to do, we're going to walk through the process of actually speaking

338
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,120
the raw protocol that we use to send email addresses.

339
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,160
So I'm going to use a tool called NSLookup here.

340
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,960
All kids use dig, because dig is what runs on Linux and everything.

341
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,480
But dig doesn't come with Windows, so this is NSLookup, which is available on most platforms.

342
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm going to do an NSLookup, name server lookup, and I'm going to say, hey, I want to know

343
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,280
Mx, set type equals Mx, mail exchanger records.

344
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,000
I want to know which computers on the internet are the mail exchangers for this domain, funwith.email.

345
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,040
And it's going to say, oh, here you go, look, SMTP1, SMTP2.

346
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,120
There's a number in here called an Mx preference.

347
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,320
Now some people call this priority, that is a stupid name for it, because a low number

348
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,600
is a higher priority.

349
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,440
Preference number 10 means try this one first.

350
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,880
If you can't get through to 10, go to preference number 20.

351
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,480
The bigger number means wait, try that one later.

352
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,120
So that's the computer we need to talk to.

353
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,640
We're going to talk to SMTP1, so I'm going to telnet into that on port 25, and it's going

354
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,680
to say, hey, nice to see you.

355
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,400
And I'm going to say, hello, I'm dylanbt.net, and it's going to say 250, I'm smtp.funwithemail.

356
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,560
And I'm going to say, I have mail from dylanbt.net, and it is going to say 250, OK.

357
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,440
And I am going to say recipient2, hello, atfun.

358
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,120
Now this is where it gets interesting, because that recipient2 is the point where we say

359
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,320
to that system, this is who we want to talk to.

360
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,760
Now I wanted to find out what actually works, like never mind what the instruction manual

361
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,480
says, I don't care what's in the spec, what actually works out here.

362
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,040
So I went on Google, and I Googled the best email providers for doing stupid experiments,

363
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,200
and then I went, no, no, no, let's go with something.

364
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,360
We're going to go with best business email hosting, and I trolled through a bunch of

365
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
search results.

366
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,680
Now one that I just want to highlight, because it is the most wonderful piece of hallucinatory

367
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,640
journalism I've ever seen, this article from PC Magazine in 2020, the best hosted email

368
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:04,920
providers are Salesforce, Microsoft Office 360 users should get their email from GoDaddyWeb

369
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,400
hosting, Zoho Loyalists should use Zoho Mail, and the best email for Microsoft organizations

370
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,560
is Teams.

371
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,920
In case you're not familiar with business email hosting, this is like you go into Cars Magazine,

372
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,960
you say, what are the best economy family cars in 2020?

373
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,440
And it says, well, there's the Hyundai Tucson, there's bicycles, there's a submarine, and

374
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,360
there's penguins, and you're like, yeah, right.

375
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,920
But I also found quite a lot of good solid articles that were recommendations for which

376
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,360
companies people use in 2023 to host email, and so I picked a bunch of those.

377
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,560
Now disclaimer here, this is not a review of business email services.

378
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,760
I do not want anyone here going away and choosing an email platform because of something

379
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,000
that I said in this talk.

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,280
What I'm doing here is the equivalent of testing cars by filling them with gravel, setting

381
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,240
them on fire, driving them off a bridge and seeing if they explode before they sink.

382
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,800
It's interesting, every provider I'm going to show you is a rock solid platform.

383
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,360
They all do email really, really well until some idiot like me comes along and tries to

384
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,560
poke them with a stick.

385
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,480
So I identified from looking at all these articles, the big players right now, Office

386
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,240
365 and Google are the ones that really kind of dominate the space.

387
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
Zoho have a lot of support from people who don't want to use the big platforms.

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,800
Proton mail is very popular because they have really strong commitment to security.

389
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,680
And Fast Mail is a, so disclaimer, Fast Mail is a company I've used to host my mail for

390
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
years and years.

391
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,240
Personally, I love them, I have no problems with them, but I'm just a regular paying customer

392
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
of all these services.

393
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880
No, I haven't talked to them, there's no endorsements.

394
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,680
So I set up email domains for every single one of those, set up all the DNS records,

395
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,640
all the anti-spam records, everything.

396
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,360
And then I went through to see how many email addresses I could register.

397
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,920
So let's try to chalera with the apostrophe in it.

398
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,200
Google, yep, no problem.

399
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,400
Office 365, yeah, no problem.

400
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,040
Go on to Zoho Mail, it let me register it.

401
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,120
So then when I click on it, apparently they didn't tell the people who built their front

402
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,080
hand that there might be apostrophes in the JSON and the email addresses.

403
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,840
So we're going to give that one a frowny face.

404
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,600
Proton mail just says, no, you can't have that, not allowed.

405
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,960
And I go on to Fast Mail and I says, please check this, so no, can't do that, not allowed.

406
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,800
Let's try Rocket Plus Groot.

407
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,480
Now I go on to Gmail and I try and create a mailbox and it says you can't contain special

408
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
characters.

409
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,280
So it looks like you can't do that.

410
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,600
Google has a weird feature and it's quite a neat feature.

411
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,760
If you have a bunch of email addresses, so we've got Iron Man at Gmail, we've got Iron

412
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,720
Man plus Jarvis, we've got Iron Dot Man, we've got Iron Dot Man plus Jarvis, we've got

413
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,880
I dot r dot dot dot dot dot dot at email dot com.

414
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,880
These all go to the same place because Google decided they don't want some situation where

415
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm Dylan Beattie and you're Dylan Dot Beattie and we're different people.

416
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,080
They went, that is too complicated for humans to understand.

417
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,200
The plus thing, the nice thing about that is it's preserved, so when you sign up for

418
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,240
like a mailing list, you could be like Dylan Dot Beattie plus NDC at Gmail dot com.

419
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,040
And then if that shows up in a data breach, I know which company the breach came from.

420
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,760
So this is plus tag tracking.

421
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,680
This is a Google feature, it's not part of an email standard, but it is worth knowing

422
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,960
about if you're working with mail deliverability.

423
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,840
So actually Rocket Plus Groot on Gmail is kind of a smiley face.

424
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,000
Microsoft 365 says no, you can't have that, so it's a cross for them.

425
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,120
Zoho Mail says invalid username, all right, fair enough.

426
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,160
Proton Mail, nope, you can't have that.

427
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:42,400
And Fast Mail says this name's already taken, which it isn't because I just registered that

428
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,720
domain, it's not taken, but yeah, we're going to give that one a sad face.

429
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,120
Now Bruce Banner in quotes, the email spec says that you can have a quoted local part

430
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,640
containing spaces.

431
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,120
There is not a single provider on the planet that I found which will let you create a mailbox.

432
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,560
So then I thought, all right, well enough fun with the sensible addresses.

433
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,200
What about single apostrophe at?

434
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,320
Google, yeah, Microsoft, yeah, Zoho Mail, no, Proton Mail, no, Fast Mail, no.

435
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,640
What about single hyphen?

436
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,320
Now this is where Google says email cannot be a single hyphen.

437
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm like, what about a double hyphen?

438
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,720
And Google goes, oh yeah, you can have that one.

439
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,440
That's fine.

440
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,640
Because 365 minus at is fine, that's legitimate.

441
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,520
Zoho says no, Proton says no, that name is already taken.

442
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Again it's not.

443
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,560
I don't know what the validation thinks is going on here.

444
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,680
Fast Mail says no.

445
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,320
So this is the set of aliases that I managed to create there.

446
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,240
This is the Google admin for gg.funwith.email.

447
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,440
To challenge in, single apostrophe is in, minus, minus is in, underscore is in.

448
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,000
Last one I wanted to try was just underscore at.

449
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,600
Zoho says yes, Outlook says yes, Zoho says, well, Zoho says, I put it in, I click add,

450
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,800
and it says, ass 101, and I'm like, I wonder where that came from, so I open up the Chrome

451
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,120
network inspector, I take the request apart, and it says, status code 200, ass 101.

452
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,920
Now where I come from, 200 means okay, right?

453
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,680
So I don't know why it's red, but we're going to go with, we're not quite sure what happened

454
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
there.

455
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,000
Finally, underscore at fm, Fast Mail just says, great choice.

456
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,200
So there we go.

457
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,960
So next I thought, all right, never mind creating mailboxes, I'm going to create a catchall

458
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
address.

459
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,040
I'm going to create an address that says anything at this domain should go to that person over

460
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,840
there, anything that's deliverable, because I wanted to see if I could push the limits

461
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,080
of what spec email addresses would actually do.

462
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,680
That's where I hit a little bit of a problem, because I went on a Gmail and I tried to send

463
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,840
an email to, quote, Bruce space banner, quote, and Gmail says no, Gmail says you can't send

464
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,520
mail to that person, it's not recognized, and that's just so it doesn't exist.

465
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,440
Proton mail, their interface said the same thing.

466
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Email address format is not valid, I'm thinking, hmm.

467
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,840
Now what we can conclude from this, is an email address valid?

468
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,920
Does it contain at least one at sign?

469
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:19,360
Because if it doesn't, no, but if it does, then it depends.

470
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,560
Can an email address be case sensitive?

471
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,960
The answer is yes, if you're evil.

472
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,200
When SMTP was introduced in the early 1980s, the way that it got rolled out was most people

473
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,600
who already had a system that had mail added an SMTP connector to it.

474
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,120
And most of those systems ran on Unix, and Unix has a case sensitive file system, and

475
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,600
it means that your mailbox has the same name as your mailbox file, which has the same name

476
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,240
as your user, which means that Alice with a little a and Alice with a big a could be

477
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,040
different people on the same Unix machine.

478
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,560
And so when you connect an SMTP relay, the spec says that once it gets to where it's

479
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,440
going, if the local administrator of that system has made it case sensitive, that should

480
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,080
be delivered intact.

481
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,160
You should never ever modify the case of somebody else's email address.

482
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,960
Now this is where the airline industry turns up and goes, we have cobalt mainframes.

483
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,480
Your email address will be uppercase, whether you like it or not.

484
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,480
So when Alex goes to Alice here, goes to buy an email ticket and get it sent to her Unix.box.edu

485
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,520
account, she's not going to get anything.

486
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,320
Because big Alice and medium Alice, they've got mailboxes, but capital Alice doesn't exist.

487
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
So can email be case sensitive?

488
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,680
It can if you really want it to, but it probably shouldn't be.

489
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
So we're going to go back to here.

490
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,480
We're going to do our 1980s flavored.

491
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,760
We got a hello, we got mail from, we got recipient to, it says okay, we're going to say data.

492
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,680
And it's going to say go ahead, end your data with a new line, dot new line, and we're just

493
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:58,880
going to say hello, dot boom, 250, okay, queued, quit, bye-bye.

494
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
And there it is.

495
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,680
We sent an email using 1982 flavored raw SMTP typing into a Windows terminal.

496
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,360
The only challenge with this is finding a network that will allow you to do it.

497
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,960
And we'll find out later why that's interesting.

498
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,900
Now this is where I start thinking, well, hang on, Gmail and Proton won't let me send

499
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,200
emails with spaces in them, but I've just proved that we can hack into the matrix.

500
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
We can send code directly.

501
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,440
So I thought, what if I go to Proton mail, look up their mail exchanger, tell that into

502
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,560
it, hello, mail from hello at fun with email recipient to that, it says protocol error,

503
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,280
okay, that's not going to work.

504
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,560
Let's try it again.

505
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,280
So ho, what do they got?

506
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:42,320
Boom, tell that into that one, hello, mail from recipient to, now I'm not relaying because

507
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
that's their domain.

508
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,120
I'm giving them money to host that, but apparently they've decided that that's relaying and they

509
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,960
are not going to let me relay.

510
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Sad face.

511
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Let's try Google.

512
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:58,640
Tell that, boom, there we go, we're in, hello, mail from, yep, okay, recipient to, that's

513
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,360
not a valid RFC 5321 address.

514
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,640
Also, there's a lie, it is a valid RFC 5321 address.

515
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,560
Google is lying to your face, but they Google, you know, what are you going to do?

516
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
So that doesn't work.

517
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:18,280
Now, I tried to do this with the Microsoft account and I could not find any network anywhere

518
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,720
that Microsoft would let me inject mail from because every single place I tried, I just

519
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,000
got access to night band sending.

520
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,040
So the NDC conference Wi-Fi didn't work, hotel Wi-Fi didn't work, tethered on my phone

521
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
didn't work.

522
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,520
On-board Wi-Fi on Norwegian air didn't work, Deutsche Bahn Railway on-board Wi-Fi didn't

523
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
work.

524
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,800
Microsoft are really good at working at who might be trying to send spam from a moving

525
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,240
train in Germany and making sure that that doesn't happen.

526
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,760
Did you try Azure?

527
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,960
Yeah, Azure Blocksport 25.

528
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,920
You can't send mail from Azure or AWS or Google Cloud.

529
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
We'll talk about that in a bit.

530
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,960
I'll look everyone on that train for sending an email.

531
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Yeah, probably.

532
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Yeah, okay.

533
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
And everyone at NDC and everyone in the hotel.

534
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Sorry.

535
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
There's research.

536
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
You know.

537
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Let's try it with fast mail.

538
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
So I got there.

539
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Mail exchanger.

540
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Tell that hello.

541
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Mail from.

542
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Recipient to.

543
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Whoa.

544
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Okay.

545
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
Okay.

546
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Data.

547
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,840
There we go.

548
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,720
This was sent to an address with spaces in it and it worked.

549
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,640
Let's see if it worked.

550
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Quit.

551
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Okay.

552
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Bye.

553
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,560
There it is.

554
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
It worked.

555
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Delivered to an email address containing spaces because this is what the specification

556
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,400
says email should do.

557
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,880
Now what we've just done there, every one of those services, we have done the digital

558
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,120
equivalent of, let's imagine that we want to email, we want to send a letter, a physical

559
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,920
letter to this, you know who this is, right?

560
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,200
This is Lazarus Trequero.

561
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
He's the president of Malawi and he lives here.

562
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,720
And so we want to send a letter to him.

563
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,040
So we're going to write a letter, put it in envelope and we're going to go to Malawi,

564
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,400
get on a plane, fly, land at Le Longue, we're going to go out of town, go up to the presidential

565
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,040
palace at the top of the hill and we're going to go, hello, hello, we have a letter for

566
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,240
his excellency.

567
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,000
Now one, that is not an efficient way to deliver mail.

568
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,600
And two, he might be out in which case we have a deliverability problem.

569
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,160
So what can we do instead?

570
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,120
Well, we do this.

571
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,800
We put a stamp on it and we put it in a mailbox and we assume that we can find any mailbox

572
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,160
anywhere on the planet.

573
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,200
We can put a letter into it and if we put the correct poster, John, it'll go where it

574
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,000
needs to go.

575
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,640
Now mailboxes work because there is a physical and financial cost to sending printed mail.

576
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
You got to buy a stamp.

577
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
You got to buy printer ink.

578
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,680
Have you seen how much printer ink costs?

579
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,360
Like if you want to sell bad penis enlargement procedures to 100,000 people, you're not going

580
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,040
to do it using a Hewlett Packard inkjet printer.

581
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,000
The business model just doesn't work.

582
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,040
So this kind of mail, it's kind of self-regulating up to a point.

583
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,720
But let's have a look at what we've got in my inbox here.

584
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,240
Now I've got a message here from Lisa Williams.

585
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,400
She's looking for a special friendship.

586
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,200
Web design prices on Google, cross-border payments international, an investment opportunity

587
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,360
for you.

588
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,600
Your subscription has been confirmed.

589
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,840
Important message FedEx International.

590
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,600
I have a new voicemail message.

591
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, lovely spam.

592
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:35,520
Let's give it up for the NDC Viking spam choir.

593
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,680
You ever wondered why junk mail is called spam?

594
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,040
So spam is spiced ham.

595
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
It's this.

596
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
It's meat in a tin, which has been around for years.

597
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,720
And Monty Python did a sketch in the 70s where someone's in a cafe and the things on the

598
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,600
menu are egg and spam and egg and bacon and spam and egg and spam and spam and sausage

599
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,160
and spam and spam and spam and spam and spam and spam.

600
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,000
And for reasons I will never understand, in the cafe where the clip said there is a chorus

601
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,200
of Vikings who sing the spam song, and I put the Monty Python clip in the video, and then

602
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,640
I thought, I'm going to be annoyed with a bunch of loud hairy men.

603
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,680
We don't need a video clip.

604
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,480
We can do this one live.

605
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,320
And yeah, so spam email is a reference to that sketch where the noise of the spam, spam,

606
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,040
spam just drowns out everything else that's going because that's what happens with junk

607
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
mail.

608
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,440
We have these unsolicited emails, and the reason we're getting them is because email was invented

609
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,720
by hippies.

610
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,480
And hippies suck at security.

611
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,640
Now things just kind of rattled on a little while, you know, 1980s sort of came and went.

612
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,440
And for a long time in the 80s, every mail server on the internet was an open relay because

613
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,800
peace and love, man, and good vibes, and yeah, it will help you relay your mail to anywhere.

614
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,720
Then the 90s comes along.

615
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,440
And what happens in the 90s is a lot of people who've never had email or the internet before,

616
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,680
they get the internet at home.

617
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,880
And the thing you've got to realize about what was happening in the 90s is that stuff

618
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,680
that was impossible is now happening daily.

619
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,160
Someone gets their first email account, and a couple of days in, they get an email from

620
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,760
their granddaughter in Australia with a photo of the new baby, and that was impossible.

621
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,160
Like a year previously, you could not do that.

622
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,480
It took three weeks to send photographs from Australia to Europe.

623
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,200
Usually this thing's happening, they're like, ah, the internet's absolutely magic.

624
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
It's brilliant.

625
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
It's amazing.

626
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,840
The next thing in their inbox is Bill Gates saying he's going to give them a million dollars

627
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,360
and everyone gets a free trip to Disneyland.

628
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,360
And they're like, well, the last thing was too good to be true, but then it happened.

629
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,080
Maybe this one's too good to be true, but maybe this one will happen as well.

630
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,800
We had no frame of reference as a population for what email could and could not do and

631
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,640
what was possible on the internet.

632
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,240
And so junk mail, scams, spams, bad medication became an absolutely rife problem.

633
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,080
Most of it sent through open email relays.

634
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,840
Now there were four approaches that we took to try and stop this.

635
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,160
One of them was they made it against the law.

636
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,560
The controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing can spam act of

637
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
2003.

638
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,520
Now, as you can tell, this was a resounding success because after 2003, there was no more

639
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,000
junk mail, right?

640
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah.

641
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,920
No, it turns out that quite a lot of people aren't in America, and quite a lot of people

642
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,880
who are in America don't give a crap.

643
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,360
And even the ones who do, it's very, very hard to prosecute them because it's ridiculously

644
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,400
easy to comply with the specifics of the can spam act.

645
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,840
So law enforcement did not deliver a solution.

646
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,280
The second approach we tried was client-side filtering.

647
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,520
You have some software that sorts out your email.

648
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Now most of us use that.

649
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
I use that.

650
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,600
You know, I have Gmail and it puts stuff in my inbox and updates and social and that

651
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
kind of stuff.

652
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,440
I'm not going to talk about that today because as a developer trying to send you an email,

653
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,600
what you're doing with it after I've delivered it, that is your problem and I don't care

654
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,680
how you've got it set up.

655
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,440
You can filter anything you want.

656
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,160
There's very little consistency.

657
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,560
That's on you to get set up the way you want to do it.

658
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,840
There's maybe some interesting stuff here about training machine learning systems.

659
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,640
But like that email that I sent at the beginning of this session that all of you said, yes,

660
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,120
I want to receive this email, quite a lot of you, it went to junk.

661
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,760
How would you train an algorithm to know that you're in Oslo right now doing a live demo

662
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
and this is important?

663
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,320
So we're not going to talk about client-side filtering.

664
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,840
What about verification?

665
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,840
One of the problems with unsolicited email is that you are not accountable.

666
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,240
There's no way of tracing the junk mail back to the person who sent it.

667
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,980
And if there was, it would be easier to find those people and tell them to stop.

668
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,280
What we need is we need peace and love and authentication.

669
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,920
And the problem is they didn't include that because the hippies didn't think we were going

670
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
to need it.

671
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,880
So when SMTP was created, it has no support, no user names, no passwords, no security,

672
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,200
no encryption, absolutely nothing.

673
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,720
And so we looked at the SMTP and we went, oh, simple mail.

674
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,000
Now we didn't want to make the complicated mail transfer protocol.

675
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,120
That might have put people off.

676
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,440
So instead, we made the extended simple mail transfer protocol.

677
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,480
Now this was actually invented at Jim Henson's Creature Shop because the difference between

678
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:04,720
SMTP and ESMTP is the SMTP, you say hello, and ESMTPC, you say, hello, which is close

679
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
enough.

680
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,360
So we're going to do an extended ESMTP transcript.

681
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,880
We're going to tell that into my fun with the email server.

682
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,880
And we're going to say hello, DylanBT.net, and it's going to go, oh, cool.

683
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,560
You speak the cool kids language.

684
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,320
Look, this is the stuff that I can do for you.

685
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,440
I support authentication using the plain system or the login system or the cram MD5 system.

686
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,640
I support start TLS, which means we can switch this whole thing to a secure channel, and

687
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,320
I do enhanced status codes.

688
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,480
And we're like, all right, well, before we send our username password, we probably want

689
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,520
to switch to the secure TLS thing.

690
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
So we're going to start TLS.

691
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,640
By the way, lots of people still call this SSL because SSL was invented at Netscape in

692
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,120
the 90s, and everyone went, yeah, secure sockets makes the internet secure.

693
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,480
SSL stopped being a good idea in 1999, but by then, we'd all got used to talking about

694
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,120
SSL certificates.

695
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,680
These days, it's actually TLS, transport layer security.

696
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,800
So we're going to send start TLS, and it's going to go, yeah, OK, go ahead.

697
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Now we're secure.

698
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,320
Start again on a secure channel.

699
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,240
Hello, DylanBT.net, there's our SMTP handshake, and now we can say, this is our username and

700
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,760
password, mashed together, base64 encoded, so it's technically not encrypted.

701
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
It's just encoded.

702
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,480
But that's going to say, authentication successful, and now we're in.

703
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,040
So we've said, this is us, look, we're a paying customer, please relay email for us.

704
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,640
But the fourth approach is let's stop the bad people being able to get onto the internet

705
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,200
in the first place.

706
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,880
Now, there's a guy called John Gilmore.

707
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
John is a very interesting person.

708
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,440
He's one of those people who I agree with everything he does right up to the point where

709
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,680
I think he turns into a bit of a dick.

710
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,280
And then he kind of stops just past that point.

711
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,760
John was employee number five at Sun Microsystems.

712
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,400
He was one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

713
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,840
He is a, I've seen him described as an extreme libertarian cypherpunk activist.

714
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,920
And the most famous quote I've seen from John is this one, the net interprets censorship

715
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,320
as damage and roots around it.

716
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,800
If you start blocking ports because you don't like what people are doing, the internet is

717
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,640
designed to find another way around it.

718
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,480
And you know, he has taken this philosophy to an extreme.

719
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,920
He runs an open mail relay.

720
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,600
If you got a hop.toad.com, it will accept email from anyone on the planet on port 25

721
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
and it will deliver it.

722
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,480
Doesn't care who you are, doesn't care where you came from, which is kind of the libertarian

723
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,600
ethos in a nutshell.

724
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,680
Like you shouldn't have to show your ID to be able to take advantage of public services.

725
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Which I kind of agree with except where the internet is concerned, because it becomes

726
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,360
too easy to abuse it.

727
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:34,560
Now, I really wanted to use toad.com in the demos I put together and in the live demo

728
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,840
we did at the beginning.

729
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,240
I couldn't.

730
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,600
Because none of the networks that I'm able to connect to would let me relay mail through

731
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
hop.toad.com.

732
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,040
They just said you can't do it.

733
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
I can't connect.

734
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,360
If you put a system in Azure, on an Azure VM or an app service and say, hey, connect

735
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,520
to that system on port 25, it says no, you can't connect to anything on port 25.

736
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Don't send spam.

737
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
Google Cloud, same thing.

738
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,080
Amazon Web Services, same thing.

739
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:06,000
Dial up most connected wi-fi, most public wi-fi, can't connect to anything on port 25.

740
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
So we can't use this open relay approach to send mail.

741
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,240
The only way we've got a sending mail is to find someone we have a relationship with and

742
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,080
use our username password to connect to their server.

743
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,640
So that's fine when we want to use our internet provider or our email service to send mail

744
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,000
to the rest of the world.

745
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,880
But what about receiving it?

746
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,680
Because the beautiful thing about email is that anyone on the planet can send me a message

747
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,320
and I should be able to get it.

748
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,160
And this is what sets it apart from things like WhatsApp and Twitter and Telegram.

749
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
There is no multinational corporation whose algorithm is showing me things they think

750
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,520
I want to see.

751
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,320
I should be able to guarantee that anyone can send me an email and I will receive that

752
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,520
email, be able to look at it, which means it needs to be wide open.

753
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,640
If I'm hosting my mail on Gmail, I can't expect everyone talking to me to set up a

754
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,600
Google account to be able to do that.

755
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,720
Likewise, Microsoft.

756
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,000
So when a mail arrives, when someone knocks on the door of fun with email and says, hey,

757
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,960
I got an email here for Dylan, what can we do to determine whether that's legitimate?

758
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,920
Well, first, we can look at the envelope.

759
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,280
We can look where did it come from?

760
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,200
Where was this mail sent?

761
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,160
What was the network address it came from?

762
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,240
Does that appear in any of the public databases of known spamming network addresses?

763
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,360
Now, this system kind of works up to a point.

764
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,560
It stops a lot of spam.

765
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,120
I'm not going to pretend it doesn't.

766
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,800
It's also a massive pain in the ass.

767
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,480
Because anyone who wants to give you a bad day can just find your email address and they

768
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,080
can report it for spamming.

769
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,680
And these places, most of them don't verify anything.

770
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,360
They're just like, OK, well, we'll add you to the list.

771
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,360
And if it's a problem, the system administrator can come on and they can request to be taken

772
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,600
off the list again.

773
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,400
Now, one, people will do this just for a laugh.

774
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,240
Two, people will block entire blocks of IP addresses.

775
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,520
If your ISP has given the next address along to someone who's sending junk mail, you could

776
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,640
find you've been blocked through no fault of your own.

777
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,280
You can only de-list from these things.

778
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,200
Most of them say once every 48 hours.

779
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,960
There's about 10 or 12 of these services.

780
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,880
This is why I stopped running my own mail server.

781
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,600
It's because I got fed up of going onto these forms and saying, no, you've blocked the entire

782
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,320
network block again.

783
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,160
And I'm not sending spam.

784
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,240
I'm doing everything right.

785
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,680
Stop cutting me off.

786
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,080
So this system doesn't work.

787
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,520
It's too easy to abuse.

788
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,080
And it kind of relies on your innocent until proven guilty.

789
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,840
But proving you guilty just means someone went, it was them.

790
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,960
And then we're going to block you for the rest of your life unless you beg and grovel

791
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,320
and try and get reinstated.

792
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,680
Let's talk about a better system.

793
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,600
Now there's a thing called SPF, the Sender Policy Framework.

794
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,760
And this is beautiful because it's built on top of the things we had right at the start

795
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
of the 80s.

796
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,920
It's built on SMTP and it's built on DNS.

797
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,400
If you've got the Google Admin toolbox and you look up fun with email on their dig toolbox,

798
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,880
you can click through the records.

799
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,160
There's a thing here called TXT records.

800
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,800
And in there, you'll see this record here.

801
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,080
It says TXT, time to live is short lived, and value equals, well, value on this thing

802
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,080
is this.

803
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,320
V equals SPF1.

804
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,840
Version is the Sender Policy Framework version one.

805
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,520
Then I got a rule here that says, OK, this email, that is allowed to send email for that

806
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:13,360
domain, funwith.email, spf.smtp.com, that's allowed, spf.messagingengine.com, that is allowed.

807
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,720
And anything else, I got a little squiggly thing, says this might be suspicious.

808
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
So what the qualifiers there?

809
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,360
Plus means a pass.

810
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,640
This rule matches, you can deliver the email.

811
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,240
Question mark means don't care.

812
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,640
Now, that's not much use in production, but it's really good for testing stuff, because

813
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,800
you can create your SPF records and see what matched without it changing any behavior.

814
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,680
A tilt here is a soft fail, flag it but deliver it.

815
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,040
And a minus, if I put a minus in there, now the plus is the default, so normally you don't

816
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,440
see those, the records actually look like this.

817
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,080
But that minus there, I can put a rule that says, look, if anyone anywhere on the internet

818
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,320
gets an email that says it comes from funwith.email, and it doesn't match that rule, you can just

819
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
ditch it.

820
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
Like, that's fine with me.

821
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,320
I'm telling you, that's junk.

822
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,120
I guarantee, these are the only people sending email on my behalf.

823
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,640
Now there's a couple of other systems we're not going to go into today, which do public

824
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
key cryptography.

825
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,040
There's a thing called a deakim, domain key identified mail, and there's a thing called

826
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,440
demark, which is the same, but it then sends you reports of anyone who's trying to pretend

827
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,600
they are you and spam stuff.

828
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,360
But this idea of building records on top of DNS to manage email, this is getting some

829
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
traction.

830
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,960
This is working pretty well.

831
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,720
Now, when we sent that at SMTP transcript earlier, we basically sent a message just

832
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
said hello.

833
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,760
Like, once we've thrown the envelope away, we don't know where it came from.

834
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
We don't know who sent it.

835
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,040
We don't know who they think they sent it to.

836
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,760
We just know that it said hello.

837
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,960
We want to send messages which are slightly more useful than that.

838
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,520
And so when we connect to our mail server and we get to the point where it says, hey,

839
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,920
data, send us your message, what we're going to do is we're going to send a block of headers.

840
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,120
This is who it's from.

841
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
This is who it's to.

842
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,480
This is the subject.

843
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,720
This is the email body.

844
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,360
It's going to say, OK, 250 queued.

845
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,360
We're going to say quit.

846
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,680
It's going to say buy.

847
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,560
And that is going to work brilliantly.

848
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,120
We get nice formatted email, and this works great as long as everything that you have

849
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,600
to say can be expressed in 7-bit ASCII, because SMTP is built on ASCII.

850
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,400
Now 7-bit ASCII was a brilliant idea in the United States of America in 1960s.

851
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,520
So was Richard Nixon and leaded gasoline.

852
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,280
You know, we can do a little better, but backwards compatibility.

853
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,840
You can't ship a mail system which can't send mail to the people who are still in the

854
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
old system.

855
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:25,000
So here in 2023, we are still stuck with 7-bit ASCII as the only way of sending anything

856
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,520
over an email platform.

857
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,920
And so we have to use MIME, the multi-purpose internet mail extensions.

858
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,600
What MIME is, is a way of taking just about any kind of content and turning it into 7-bit

859
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,160
ASCII, sending it over the wire, and rehydrating it at the other end.

860
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,560
Now MIME is actually pretty clever.

861
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,000
It's a very, very elegant system.

862
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,600
So we got our headers from, to, subject, date is this.

863
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,360
Now MIME version 1.0, MIME is supposed to have other versions.

864
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,880
It was supposed to have 1.1, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, but they never figured out how that was going

865
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,000
to work.

866
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,200
So basically we are stuck with 1.0 being a floating point boolean, that if it's 1.0,

867
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,880
yes, and anything else means this is probably not valid MIME.

868
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,520
Now we're going to throw in a content type here, and say this is a multi-part mixed message

869
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,800
and the boundary string is this.

870
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,400
Now this can be anything you like as long as it doesn't appear in your message anywhere.

871
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,100
We're going to put in a message, now this, this is a multi-part message in MIME format.

872
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,240
This is for old, old email readers that don't know about MIME.

873
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,040
There aren't very many of them around anymore.

874
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,200
Now we get to the good stuff.

875
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,840
So that's the header on our message.

876
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,200
I'm going to put in a boundary, it says we're starting a block here.

877
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,760
And this block is multi-part alternative.

878
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,200
This says we're sending you the same message, but in two or three different ways.

879
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,320
So we've now got a different boundary.

880
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,600
We're going to say, right, this is the text plane version of this email, hello, we're

881
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,960
having fun with email, and then we are going to have the HTML version, hello, we're having

882
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,960
fun with email, this bit is an HTML format.

883
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,000
And then we're going to close out that boundary block, and then we're going to close out the

884
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
other one.

885
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,120
So now we've put another container.

886
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,000
So MIME is actually a tree structure.

887
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,880
You can have containers inside, containers inside containers.

888
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,720
And in this one, we're going to say, hey, we're going to do an attachment here.

889
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,320
This is fun with email.png.

890
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,200
It's base64 encoded, because that's seven-bit ASCII safe.

891
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,540
That's the file name.

892
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,980
It should be an attachment.

893
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,960
So this should show up as a little paper clip in your email client.

894
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,000
And then we're going to have this massive, great, big long block of base64 encoded stuff.

895
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,040
Now it's all well and good.

896
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,040
These are standards.

897
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,520
You can go out, you can study them, you can figure out how they work, you can write your

898
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,640
own implementations.

899
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,880
If you are actually building an application that works with any of this stuff, you have

900
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,960
a whole bunch of challenges ahead of you, not least because email is an open standard.

901
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,480
And when you create code to send somebody a message, you have absolutely no idea what

902
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,920
device they are going to be using to look at that.

903
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,800
They might be reading it on Yahoo.

904
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,360
They might be reading it on Outlook or on an Android phone.

905
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,760
They might be using a screen reader.

906
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,640
There is a whole raft of different things out there.

907
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,640
And these days, most email is HTML because HTML looks nice.

908
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,840
And because our marketing teams want us to send HTML emails so we can have buttons and

909
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:12,160
colors and links and those things in it, HTML email is horrible.

910
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,000
It is one of humankind's terrible, terrible mistakes.

911
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,320
The good news is that there are services out there that mean you don't kind of have to

912
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,960
touch the icky bits quite as much as you used to.

913
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,160
One of these is a thing called the MailJet markup language.

914
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,040
So MailJet is an email marketing and relay company and MJML is their way of writing HTML

915
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,040
emails.

916
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,480
There is another one which is called Foundation, foundation for email.

917
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,560
They don't have a logo but they do have a picture of a squid or a cuttlefish.

918
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,520
So I thought, all right, we will put that in here.

919
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,600
Now fundamentally what these things do is they give you a language which looks a bit

920
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,800
like HTML.

921
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,720
So I am going to write an email and this is MailJet markup language.

922
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,000
So I have got a MailJet head with a preview, I have got a body with a section and a column.

923
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,080
Now this is, it looks like HTML, it is an XML kind of compliant dialect.

924
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,080
It is not HTML.

925
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,440
What we are going to do is we are going to run this through the MailJet compiler because

926
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:12,920
the HTML that clients actually understand looks like this.

927
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,560
It is a sack of horrors.

928
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,040
If you read this closely, what we have got there is we have got a table inside a table

929
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,360
inside a table and if you are on a Microsoft Outlook or Internet Explorer platform you

930
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:29,560
get two extra tables for free because the blue comments there are the Microsoft if this

931
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,240
is Microsoft Outlook then include this extra chunk of markup.

932
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,680
Now I know people who used to write this stuff by hand.

933
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,080
I used to write this stuff by hand.

934
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,200
Platforms like MailJet have made the whole thing so much easier to manage.

935
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,280
One of the things that they don't really do is general purpose templating.

936
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,520
They are transpilers.

937
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,280
They have no idea of behavior.

938
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,880
They don't work like a view engine like Razor or something.

939
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,920
What you can do, we are not going to go into the specifics in this talk, but you can have

940
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,760
projects where you take MailJet and when you compile it you turn your MailJet into Razor.

941
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,520
Then at runtime you put a model into your Razor and you get populated HTML with individual

942
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,040
order items and stuff at the other end.

943
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,200
If you want to see how that works, I got some code up on GitHub you can go and poke around

944
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,200
with it.

945
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,200
You get to the end of it and it works on your machine.

946
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,720
Which is kind of pointless because why would you send yourself email?

947
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,000
How do you test this stuff?

948
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,440
If you are developing a system that is going to send emails, there are a couple of rules

949
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,040
that I absolutely live by.

950
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,240
The first one is you want an end point on your website somewhere where you can see what

951
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,000
the email is supposed to look like.

952
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,600
The NDC tickets platform that we use in London and Copenhagen and Porto.

953
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,760
Every single order in that there is a link at the bottom where you can say show me what

954
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,720
that email is supposed to look like.

955
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,320
One this is useful just for being able to check details on something.

956
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,080
When you are designing this stuff, you can just keep refreshing that page because it

957
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,120
is way quicker to reload the page or use a hot reload or web plug-in than to send yourself

958
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,920
an email, wait for it to come through, go to your inbox, open it up, still doesn't look

959
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,920
quite right.

960
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,920
Round we go again.

961
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,200
This gets you to the point where it looks right.

962
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,600
Next tool that I use is the paper cut.

963
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,240
Paper cut is a Windows application that sits in the corner of your screen in your system

964
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,480
notification tray and it is an SMTP server that doesn't send email.

965
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,880
Every email that you send, it intercepts it and it goes, yep, we got it, here it is.

966
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,400
It lets you go through and inspect all the properties.

967
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,520
You can see your message in a browser view there, that's pretty good.

968
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,200
You can see your message headers.

969
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,760
What exactly got filled in by the code that you were using to generate your mail messages?

970
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:37,760
You can see the body, you can see the individual sections, how the mind format breaks down.

971
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,120
You can see the raw message content for the whole thing.

972
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,520
If something doesn't look right, this is a great tool for diving in and figuring out

973
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,800
how that works.

974
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
You got works on my machine in a browser.

975
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,520
You got works on my machine with an SMTP relay.

976
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,320
Let's see if it actually works on the internet.

977
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,720
Mail Trap is a fantastic bit of kit that I've used on dozens of projects over the years.

978
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,800
Mail Trap, again, it pretends to be a mail server, so you send your mail via Mail Trap

979
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,640
and instead of sending it, it intercepts it, gives you some of the same features that paper

980
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,640
cut does.

981
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,120
You can see different representations, but then it's got tools like this.

982
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,000
That's your HTML, that's your HTML source.

983
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,160
That's your raw message body.

984
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,080
This is your spam analysis.

985
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,400
This is all the reasons why that email might get picked up as junk.

986
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,760
Now, if you look at this one real closely, I got a .8 on there, and I got a whole string

987
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,840
of zeros, but the .8 is because the domain name that I sent it from is less than 28 days

988
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,680
old, and this is the kind of thing they pick up on.

989
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,120
If you're warming up a project for a big client who's going to send a lot of email, you need

990
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,720
to start sending email early because it can take a couple of months for their outgoing

991
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,960
relay, that domain name and everything, to be trusted and established by services all

992
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,960
over the internet.

993
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,920
I'm going to do the HTML check on here now.

994
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,080
This is going to say, look, this is the stuff that you ended up using in that email, and

995
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,640
this is where it's not going to work.

996
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,120
You've got a thing in there, so Gmail's mobile webmail has flagged two issues that

997
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,920
won't render properly on that.

998
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,960
All the way down to AOL and IOS and the fastmail, desktop webmail, all these kind of platforms.

999
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,280
Now, let's assume we have done our due diligence.

1000
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,760
We've tested all these platforms.

1001
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,200
We've designed the email, the client signed it off, and we've tested it on Gmail, IOS,

1002
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,840
Android, Outlook, Zoho, Proton, Fastmail, AOL, Yahoo, Thunderbird, Yudora, Vivaldi,

1003
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,680
Mail, and Pine, and then we get that WhatsApp from the client going, the email doesn't look

1004
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,680
right, and you're like, what?

1005
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:32,560
Just send me a screenshot, and they send you this, and you're, ah.

1006
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,880
I absolutely believe that we all have the right to consume digital media in a format

1007
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:46,240
of our choice, using our chosen fonts, color schemes, devices, layout, screen reader accessibility,

1008
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,240
whatever.

1009
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,760
I also think that dark mode email is an eldritch horror that should never have been allowed

1010
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,760
to live.

1011
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,560
I want to find a friend of yours who's a graphic designer.

1012
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:02,560
I want you to ask them to design you a book cover or something, and then mention in the

1013
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,720
brief, oh, yeah, by the way, we don't know yet if it's going to be on black paper or

1014
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,720
white paper.

1015
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,720
Is that a problem?

1016
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,480
Because they're probably going to slap you.

1017
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,200
Because the first thing you think about when you design things like marketing collateral

1018
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,520
is what are we going for here?

1019
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,800
Is this like dark with light, or is this light with dark?

1020
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,280
Giving the client control over that on something like email just opens you.

1021
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,280
Now there are CSS rules and selectors that are supposed to let us do multiple versions

1022
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,280
of everything.

1023
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,080
They don't actually work terribly reliably.

1024
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,960
They're getting better, but the situation we have now is if you've got transparent PNGs

1025
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,680
in your email, you just need to come up with something that works on both.

1026
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,440
Often if it works on both, it doesn't look great on either of them.

1027
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,200
You're not having to put little outlines around your logo so they're still visible and they

1028
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,200
don't disappear into the background.

1029
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,200
This is, you know, I find it immensely frustrating as a developer whose job is to maintain and

1030
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,880
support these kinds of things, but I also think it's incredibly healthy.

1031
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,120
The reason why so many of these things exist, validating email and is this email address

1032
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,120
valid?

1033
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,080
Email is a moving target.

1034
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,080
It's not fixed.

1035
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,080
Nobody controls it.

1036
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,840
It isn't like someone says email version two will be active as of today.

1037
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,160
It is a distributed federated system where different people are free to implement parts

1038
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,240
of that protocol, however works for them.

1039
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,760
They do what works for their systems.

1040
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,080
An email address is valid.

1041
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,080
It worked yesterday.

1042
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,480
That doesn't mean it still works today.

1043
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,760
Email that rendered properly last week may not render properly this week.

1044
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,960
Something that didn't work last week, someone might upgrade their client.

1045
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,320
It works suddenly.

1046
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,680
And as challenging and frustrating as this is as a developer, I love it because no one

1047
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,600
can mess with email.

1048
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,360
Zuckerberg and his cronies can't come along and kick you off email the way they can kick

1049
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:55,160
you off WhatsApp or kick you off Instagram or Facebook or get you banned from Twitter

1050
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,520
or you're not allowed to use Signal anymore.

1051
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,840
I can set up a server and you can set up a server and we can talk to each other.

1052
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,680
And we can send each other email using open standards and open protocols.

1053
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,400
And it is one of the last systems left which allows us to do that without a multinational

1054
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,640
corporation wanting to harvest our data, verify our accounts, make sure we are who

1055
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,560
we say we are, use algorithms to sell crap to us and throttle the whole process if it

1056
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,440
decides it doesn't like us.

1057
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,400
Now that is where we are going to end the version of this talk that is going on to YouTube.
