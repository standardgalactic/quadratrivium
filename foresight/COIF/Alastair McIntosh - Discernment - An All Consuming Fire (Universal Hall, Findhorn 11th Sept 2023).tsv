0	9000	My name is Rebecca, and it's my very great pleasure to host this evening.
9000	21000	Shortly, we'll start with a few minutes of silence, and then I'll say a few words of introduction to Alistair, for those of you who may not have met him before.
21000	33000	We're starting on time this evening, and we're going to finish on time too, as Alistair will be driving home to Glasgow after the event.
33000	47000	Alistair spent the day working with the Gen Retreat participants and has generously agreed to come and offer this time with the wider community.
47000	57000	And in waving his fee for this event is ensuring that as much as money as possible goes towards the sanctuary rebuilding.
57000	63000	Thank you for this, Alistair.
63000	72000	Now, if you'd like to get comfortable, I'll just say a few words to lead us into the silence.
72000	84000	Let's spend a few moments gathering ourselves in the silence of our hearts and minds.
84000	98000	Let's welcome our connection with the over-lighting essence of this place, which continues to inspire us in new directions.
98000	108000	Let's be aware of our connection to this land, to the ancestors, to each other.
108000	112000	Draw closer into the silence.
128000	141000	Thank you.
141000	146000	I'd like to introduce you to Alistair Macintosh.
146000	154000	He is an academic, a teacher, an inspirational speaker and storyteller.
154000	165000	He's written many books and papers, some of which are available here to purchase if you're quick off the mark at the end of the session this evening.
165000	172000	As a Quaker, he comes from a long tradition of spiritual activism.
172000	185000	I encourage you to look at his website, which is a treasure trove of ideas and offerings exploring many of the urgent issues of our times.
185000	194000	Perhaps more importantly for us tonight, Alistair is a great friend of the Findhorn community.
194000	198000	He's often spoken at conferences here.
198000	201000	He is a Findhorn fellow.
201000	209000	He did a Findhorn TEDx talk, which is well worth finding.
209000	215000	And he's run week-long programmes, the last one being on spiritual activism.
215000	219000	I asked him about his first visit here.
219000	223000	When did he first connect with the community?
223000	243000	And he told me that it was when he was aged 20 in 1976, when he brought a group of fellow students from Aberdeen University to investigate the claims of giant cabbages.
243000	256000	What touched him most in that visit, though, wasn't cabbages, but the building work that was being done on the foundations of this building.
256000	264000	The whole community took part in the creation of this building. Everybody was involved.
264000	277000	And if they were elderly, perhaps, and they weren't able to carry bricks and planks, then they baked cakes for the tea bloke.
277000	287000	Alistair wrote of that time, we were all embarking on a deep awakening.
287000	292000	He is a fellow traveller on that path of deep awakening.
292000	304000	Welcome, Alistair, and thank you.
304000	312000	Thank you so much, Rebecca and Roy, also for hosting me last night.
312000	320000	I drove up here last night, I've got a very tight schedule just now, and I've arrived just in time for dinner.
320000	330000	I should say I'm, oh hello, Chris. Chris, long ago was one of the students of my wife and I. Nice to see you.
330000	342000	And also, I was delighted to hear that another former student, Sam Graham, has been engaged with John Talbot and some wonderful work here.
342000	349000	I don't know if he's listening on the Zoom, but if you are, hello, Sam, and I've been hearing great things.
349000	360000	I was just going to say, Chris, I'm making a false start, and this is going to explain what I'm going to be doing tonight and then make a proper start, so to speak.
360000	370000	And what I just need to explain is the reason I've got my phone on my knee here is that I've gone pretty profoundly deaf,
370000	381000	and so I use complex little microphones, got one plugged in up there that feed into my hearing aids by Bluetooth who's here, another emergency one here,
381000	391000	but I control the sound on my own app, so it's not that I'm doing my emails.
391000	400000	Over end would suggest otherwise, perhaps, but just I'm dealing with that.
400000	413000	When we're doing this discussion, if I don't pick you up right, if I pick you up wrongly, then please, it's not you, it's just a hardware problem and me rather than a software problem in you.
414000	426000	What I'm going to be doing tonight is quite difficult, and I just want to give a bit of a preamble, because I'm here, thanks to, let me just get a surname correctly, thanks to Anna Corfassner.
426000	431000	Anna Corfassner, who I've just spent a day together with Madge Bray.
431000	442000	You want to just give a wave, Madge, so they can see you. Madge, there's a local tradition there from these parts, somebody you should really know about, who has deeply enriched the day in which we were looking at
442000	448000	the indigenous, the group of just over 20 young people over there in Cologne.
448000	459000	So I've been quite pressured in putting this talk together, because I had that to prepare as well as Karen and I going off to our home area in France on Thursdays,
459000	465000	so I'd love to do with that, and for that reason, I've been more formally structured in what I'm going to be doing tonight.
465000	472000	I'm going to be using notes, which I don't usually do, but give me a bit less spontaneous.
472000	482000	It's also quite a library with me, because I may be referring to that in quoting various passages, I'm just giving you a little bit of context.
483000	498000	The biggest thing is that when Anna first invited me, somebody, and I can't find my record so it was contacted me, asking if I would do a talk like this, saying that the Finthhorn community was going through a lot of transition,
498000	505000	and given my background, could I come and talk about land reform and appropriate community buyout structures.
505000	523000	Now, I don't know who that person is, but if they are here, my apologies to you, and please understand, the reason I said no was that it's actually none of my business to poke my nose into your business as to what kind of structures and so on you might be looking at.
523000	535000	And I said to Rebecca, I want to be quite careful this evening to try and avoid that ground and in discussion, but I ask you not to lead me into ground that is kind of internal.
535000	556000	Because instead, what I'm going to be doing is that on the 17th of August, I think it was, Roger and Terry, your CEO, organised a Zoom seminar for Finthhorn fellows who were at least 50 of us on it, as to what the changes were.
556000	579000	And I am taking the setting of that Zoom meeting that we had as being the appropriate framework in which for me to speak tonight, not in terms of trying to tell you what we should be doing, but rather to reflect on where we are in these times,
579000	603000	on why it is that what you are going through is far from unique in these times. How that speaks to the condition of these times, as Carl Jung puts it, when the spirit of the death breaks through and interrupts the spirit of the age.
603000	617000	And what callings, what meanings, what promptings, is my point of stories. I'm going to speak for about an hour in total, I want about three and a half hour at the end of the discussion.
617000	638000	The effect of people keeping an eye on time, when we're about three quarters away soon, when we've got about three quarters on our left, give me a re-nudge so I know I've got 15 minutes to wind up, so as to make sure we honour space.
638000	653000	So that's me just setting the parameters. And now, if perhaps I can make a proper start and share with me for a few moments of quicker style stillness.
698000	724000	I've heard from the first verse of the first chapter of the Hindu sacred text, the Bhagavad Gita, which I often use to set the framework to remind us of the framework in which we hold our grounded presence.
725000	730000	Dharma kashetra, on the field of Dharma.
731000	739000	Kua kashetra, on the battlefield of the tribal group known as Rukus.
741000	751000	Sanjaya, the name of the eagle-eyed Sharia pier, of the blind king through to restra.
754000	766000	Wan muskaru, in his wonderful Penguin Classics translation, not the most scholarly translation, but certainly as Ravindra Naskagor recognised.
767000	776000	Muskaru's translations of the Gita and the Pranishads are the most poetic and get most to the spiritual essence of it.
777000	791000	Translate that first line as, on the field of truth, on the field of Dharma, on the battlefield of life, what came to pass Sanjaya.
792000	796000	There we have nested three levels of reality to take them in reverse order.
796000	815000	Of what came to pass, what happens in the now, on the battlefield of life, in that wider framework of looking at our lives as a whole, consisting of a flow of these present moments of the now.
815000	844000	Dharma kashetra, on the field of truth, on the field of Dharma, held in what I would call the God's Peace, the divine holding of the whole shebang, the present moment of us sitting here tonight, held in the context of our wider lives, held in a universal context that's a pathos understanding of anyone.
846000	855000	When looking at the future of a community, I would suggest holding it at those three levels.
856000	869000	At what it is in practical terms we need to do right now, and to keep the show together, on how that interacts with how we use our lives in service.
869000	879000	And deepest of all, highest of all, what the divine calling of it all is.
879000	894000	As Rebecca said, I came here, first of all, on 2 May 1976, when a retired London banker called John Hilton showed us round.
895000	899000	He said, well, we're trying to live down the giant cabbages and strawberries.
899000	908000	We're trying to concentrate on the spirituality that we are trying to constantly hear, and that this place concentrates.
909000	922000	And he took us to a building site. It has all sand and building materials, and one hippie sort of people with long golden hair and rippling muscles carrying stuff around.
922000	931000	And John said, here we are building the universal ball, and people will come from all over the world.
932000	936000	Whenever I speak here, I bring with me just as a kind of person.
937000	951000	Hallez man, the book I bought in the Phoenix shop, or have it now is these days, altered states of consciousness edited by Charles T. Tartt, a seminal work to which I still refer in my work.
952000	960000	And the key word there is consciousness, because this is a new age community.
961000	968000	I sit within the Quaker tradition, the new age maybe overlaps with that, it's not entirely the same.
969000	973000	But what is it that we're talking about when we talk about the new age?
973000	980000	I was intrigued, delighted the other day in that Zoom seminar, to see William Bloom there.
981000	984000	I don't think I've ever met him in person.
985000	997000	But perhaps the most significant book about the new age movement, that's its title, in the UK is by the academic Paul Healus from the Lancaster University Religious Studies Unit.
997000	1012000	And I'd just like to read you what he says here, because he's got an appendix here, characterisations of the new age, saying William Bloom's excellent 1992 formulation runs as follows.
1013000	1018000	And I'm not going to read you through the two pages of bullet points, but I'm going to read you one of them.
1019000	1030000	During this period of time, the evolution of the planet and of humanity has reached a point when we are undergoing a fundamental spiritual change in our individual mass consciousness.
1031000	1035000	This is why we talk of a new age.
1036000	1043000	This new consciousness is a result of the increasingly successful incarnation of what some people call the energies of cosmic love.
1043000	1056000	This new consciousness demonstrates itself in an instinctive understanding of the secretness, and in particular the interconnectedness of all existence.
1057000	1061000	This is why we talk of a new age.
1062000	1074000	So, my first time of hearing of Findhorn was actually from our church of Scotland minister, that's the paterian minister, Ardyn Collin McLean, when I was growing up in the Isle of Lewis.
1075000	1087000	And I can remember conversations in the man's after the Sunday sermon, my father, a doctor in the Isle of Lewis, we had a close social relationship between the two families.
1087000	1094000	And they would talk about all manner of things, including what was happening at this place called Findhorn.
1095000	1103000	And that's why I was moved on 2 May 1974 to bring that through from Aberdeen University here, so that we might investigate.
1104000	1110000	Only to be told it wasn't about giant cabbages so much as about spirituality.
1111000	1113000	So what's happened since then?
1113000	1127000	Since then, over the past 20 years, and this came out strongly in the Fellows Zoom things, I would say that there have been six main changes that have made life more difficult for you now than it was then.
1128000	1130000	First of all, there is a sense of mission completed.
1131000	1135000	You've got Findhorn spin-offs all over the world.
1135000	1144000	You look at any academic paper about the so-called New Age, and Findhorn will almost certainly feature prominently in it.
1145000	1155000	The elders in a sense have done that task that they set out to do in the late 60s, early 70s in that respect.
1156000	1160000	But furthermore, the internet means you no longer have to be here.
1160000	1166000	Hello all of you on Zoom. None of you had to fly into Inverness to hear me tonight, did you?
1169000	1171000	But you know what I mean.
1172000	1178000	Folks don't have to come in physical presence to a place to have the same experience as they did before.
1179000	1185000	Thirdly, in as much as people are conscious, they will be socially and environmentally conscious,
1185000	1189000	and thereby aware of the carbon karma of travel.
1190000	1196000	So you have to think, I would say, not a question of not travelling, but think twice about travelling.
1197000	1202000	So that will be an added factor. You've got Brexit affecting people's visas.
1203000	1208000	You've had the massive knock of COVID, and on top of that you had the fire.
1209000	1211000	On top of that you had the fire.
1215000	1225000	Some years ago, when, you must forgive me folks, I'm very badly behaved,
1226000	1233000	I should be referring to Judas as my focaliser when I come here, but out of necessity I always caught my mind.
1238000	1242000	And I was running, of course, in spiritual activism, the spiritual basis of activism.
1242000	1249000	And I happened to be sharing a bungalow with a wonderful man, a former director of education here,
1250000	1253000	Michael Lindfield, who is one of the Ffintan Fellows.
1254000	1262000	And I wrote to him on the 11th of August prior to the Fellows' Meeting.
1263000	1269000	I wrote to him reflecting on where things are at now, because it doesn't just affect you, it affects Schumacher College,
1269000	1276000	it affects the Iona community with which I'm closely associated, it affects all of these kinds of things.
1278000	1284000	And we have an email discussion of what is going on. I'd like to read you from his email with his permission.
1285000	1290000	Yes, our God is an all-consuming fire.
1291000	1298000	In the lineage here at Meditation Mount, the Roberto Assaggi, only inspired.
1299000	1302000	Marilyn, of course, had he worked closely with Assaggi only.
1303000	1308000	I was delighted to hear that it was apparently so deaf, he didn't even try to use gismos like this,
1309000	1315000	it probably didn't exist then, but he had his questions written down and so on, and yet he's still managed.
1315000	1331000	In our lineage here at Meditation Mount, transformation is described as a shifting consciousness from one state to a new level of beingness through the agency of fire, the italicisers.
1332000	1340000	I believe that the original forms of communal living created at Ffintan have to be recycled and out of this natural state of temporary chaos,
1340000	1349000	a new order will be called into being by the note of fiery purpose, as is intentionally sounded.
1350000	1361000	This compelling call of purpose, this compelling call of purpose, not generational, not strategic plan thinking that,
1361000	1378000	but heeding a call, a vocation is vocal, it is a call of purpose, is a magnetic appeal that attracts random elements like iron filings and brings them into a new pattern of relationship with others.
1379000	1387000	Ffintan has gone through the outer fire and now needs to go through the inner fire for deep transformation to take place.
1388000	1413000	Hence my title this evening, discernment and all-consuming fire, to discern from the Latin die to cut through a diagonal that cuts through and sinair to separate, to cut through and to separate, to separate what is of true spiritual calling from that which is of other forms of calling.
1414000	1422000	And so Terry Gilby, your CEO, said to the fellows, I want to start with collective consultation.
1423000	1431000	How does the foundation serve the world today and into the future? And may that be different from how we have done it and are doing it?
1431000	1446000	And just in reading those words, I realise how potentially explosive that is. I want to start with collective consultation. I've been involved in managing decline in organisations and let me tell you it's a horrible experience.
1447000	1461000	It's a horrible experience because everybody who's not simply a part of it feels left out in some way and you're there trying to hold it all and balance it all. It's very difficult stuff. It needs skilled holding.
1462000	1483000	Offs those who are management, managing change, but it also requires holding in a way that keeps on calling those who have got positions of responsibility or trustees or whatever it might be, calling them back to that God-given, higher purpose.
1483000	1495000	Dharma cieshetwyr in the field of Dharma. What is the field of design calling? That's what the Dharma is, that we are held in.
1496000	1508000	And so Terry continued, or rather the fellows chat. I take your part in the fellows chat, said the foundation was originally set up to support the impulse manifesting through the community.
1509000	1519000	Now is a time to let go of the organisational ego, the outward face and listen to the angel of fintone. In the Bible it talks about the angels of the nations.
1520000	1535000	My late friend, the American theologian Walter Wink talks about the principalities and the powers and the angels being an expression for the interiority, the spiritual inner constellation of things.
1535000	1550000	By which the Dharma comes through, or in his Christian context, the way, the life and the truths that his Christ comes through in organisational experts.
1551000	1560000	And that is why Jung said, one does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.
1561000	1570000	One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.
1570000	1578000	My source of which is the CG Jung Foundation's Twitter account on 8 September.
1583000	1596000	Now Jung said, and again this was something, you know the wonderful serendipitys, just day before yesterday a Jungian on Twitter put out this sharing.
1597000	1603000	From visions notes of a seminar given 1930 to 1934 volume one.
1604000	1611000	Jung said this, when you, because I mean let's be clear folks, you folks are in a very disagreeable situation just now.
1612000	1624000	Yes, you know, everybody talks optimistically about well the fire cleanser, the phoenix will rise and all the rest of it and yet you know how difficult that is.
1624000	1637000	But this is what Jung said about such situations. He said, when you get into a disagreeable situation, where you see no opening, no direct path, you assume that you are quite alone with yourself.
1639000	1648000	You know the military, I give lectures to the military on non-violence and they speak of the loneliness of high command.
1648000	1661000	The loneliness of when you are carrying things and you can perhaps see things that you can't always share with others, the reasons of confidentiality of whatever people's employment contracts or whatever it might be.
1662000	1674000	You are in a lonely position. You assume that you are quite alone with yourself in a way to the very good thing that you think so, otherwise you would never make up your mind.
1674000	1695000	You would remain merely a child. We have to accept that lonely work, that lonely pilgrimage every next step and this is not just those in appointed positions of responsibility.
1696000	1716000	This applies to every one of us for the reasons that I'm going to be coming to in terms of how to organise a community in a spiritually held place and how every one of us, no matter how insignificant we might feel we are, has a place in holding.
1717000	1743000	Let's see what else Jung says. He says, you must believe that you are practically alone. At which point I refer to Henri Corbyn's book Alone with the Alone, a very deep study of the Sufism of Ibn Arabi and what Corbyn is saying, I brought these along just to fold them up because I like the physicality of holding a book.
1743000	1752000	A book is a sacred object in the sense that my ones have written all over and dogged them. What have you done?
1753000	1772000	Corbyn says, Corbyn, citing Ibn Arabi from the Islamic tradition, speaks about the loneliness of God, speaks about how God prays for the world.
1772000	1782000	Let's just confine ourselves to this world and let's just confine ourselves to the human world for now rather than widening it out beyond our immediate relics.
1782000	1798000	God in God alone prays for the world and when we pray with God then we become companions with the divine.
1799000	1825000	What Dame Julian of Norwich spoke of as a revelation of divine love, such as how divine love happens when we in whether you call it meditation or contemplation or prayer, when we hold or ask to be held in that divine hand,
1826000	1843000	when we ask for our concerns to be held in that divine hand, when we ask to be held in God's presence and to pray with God for God's work or God's or Allah or Brahman or Dao or Buddha nature.
1843000	1851000	I don't mind what you call it, forgive me, I'm coming out of my tradition. I'm coming out of my tradition when I'm back on holiday on the Isle of Lewis.
1851000	1859000	I make a point of going to the local Presbyterian Free Church of Scotland. You'll have heard all about them, Kate Forbes and all of that.
1859000	1871000	Yes, that is of the church of the community that I was raised in along with the Church of Scotland. I go to their sermons unless they can be very long and sometimes quite hellfire.
1871000	1891000	But you know what I love about them? I love the long, extemporary prayers because in those prayers, the Minister of the Elders hold the whole community, they summon the whole community, they name people in the community who are struggling with life or have celebrating something in life
1891000	1901000	and they bring it all before God and ask God to hold this in God's holy hand so that the community is carried.
1901000	1915000	I see you have Mary Campbell, my friend Mary Campbell coming and playing here. You may not know that her grandfather, her father and mother Archie and Marjorie were Edinburgh or our Edinburgh Quakers.
1915000	1933000	Her grandfather was Duncan Campbell, an evangelist in the Isle of Lewis in the 1950s, and Duncan Campbell, Mary's grandfather, defined revival as being a community saturated in God.
1933000	1953000	And what I'm really saying to you, what I'm trying to suggest to Nightford, is that if you're going to get out of this hole and if the phoenix is going to rise, ask yourself, are you open to that being saturated in God?
1953000	1975000	And if so, how might you express it? There's more on you, I'll leave it there, but I'd just like to mention Winifred Rushford because I stayed at, I had a long association with her daughter Diana Niels, a pregnant called Farm.
1975000	1990000	And Winifred was a pioneer of New Age in Scotland, particularly through therapeutic work at the Davidson Clinic. She was a psychotherapist. She had been a missionary doctor in India.
1990000	2013000	And her book, Something is Happening, subtitled Spiritual Awareness and Depth Psychology in the New Age, 1972, there she died at the age of 78. Laurence van der Post through the friend of hers and who stood in for Prince Charles at her funeral, asked her what was the secret of her energy.
2013000	2029000	She said, I never go against my unconscious. And she met Jung, she tells in that book, page 13, she met Jung when she was at Oxford in 1939, just before the Second World War.
2029000	2045000	She was speaking to a group of psychiatrists, and Jung said to the psychiatrist, this is your insanity. This is your insanity that you have lost your religion, that you have lost your connection with the divine.
2045000	2068000	You see what I'm calling to, you see why Michael Linfield resonates with T.S. Eliot in Little Giddings. The only hope or else despair lies in the choice of power to power to be redeemed from fire by fire.
2069000	2088000	What does that entail? It entails sitting in that oral consuming fire. In the Orthodox Christian tradition, the fire of hell is only the fire of love that can only burn off that which is not authentic to us.
2089000	2095000	Authentic, deeply author coming from the deep self, the way the truth in the life.
2096000	2105000	So our game needs to be to allow that fire of hell that screws up our plans in life in so many ways.
2105000	2127000	Come to understand it, the fire of divine love that can't burn out, burn off anything true to us. And that's just why Yates in the Celtic twilight talks about, let me read you the poem right at the end. How's my time? What time are we?
2128000	2142000	And we'll finish at...excellent, excellent. I've got another 20 minutes of venting. Wonder if, don't tell my wife that, she'll tell me, oh you should stop sooner.
2143000	2157000	Oh, yes. I've always taken a neighbor. Well, you know the banter we have. You know how we carry on it. I have two minds of life. One is in Finthbone here and the other is back in Glasgow. It's for rent.
2158000	2181000	Enter the twilight. Outworn heart in the outworn time. Come clear the nets of the wrong and the right. Come heart where hill is heaped upon hill, for there the mystical brotherhood of hollow wood and hilly wood and the changing moon work out their will and God stands winding his lonely horn.
2181000	2210000	The time and the world are ever in flight and God stands winding his human, his lonely horn. Again, that alone was the alone that the hands and feet of the divine in this world, our hands and feet. And can we put our weight behind that?
2211000	2232000	Because if we do at the Doughty Ching, chapter 16, then the myriad creatures all rise together and I watch their return. Returning to one's roots is known as stillness. This is what is meant by returning to one's destiny.
2232000	2249000	Some years ago, when I was here, Michael Lindfield gave a lecture. It had a mixed reception. He was talking quite a bit about Christianity. He didn't go down well with everybody, just as me talking about it might not go down well with everybody.
2249000	2265000	But his passion that night that stayed with me was to call the foundation here, or call the community, let me say here, back to its original, God inspired roots. Rebecca, have you got that term?
2265000	2291000	Can you remember, off-heart, what you rescued from the fire? If I move my microphone, or you've got your own microphone, could you just read it because you rescued this from the fire? Can you make that out? If I hold the mic for you so you can give me the mic?
2296000	2301000	Oh, there we go. Thank you.
2301000	2316000	When we were clearly enough after the sanctuary fire, we were taking bits and pieces individually in a kind of ritualistic fashion towards the skip that was clearly wide dance.
2316000	2335000	And I was passed a pile of ashes with some pieces of gold paper, gold leaf from something, and some burnt, singed pages of I mean's guidance, which is what you wanted me to read here.
2335000	2364000	The dawn is at hand into new and uncharted waters, griffith and proofing, rough and smooth. Listen and hear my voice, a new heaven and a new earth.
2365000	2390000	Can I just read that out? Again, the part one glimpses of Eileen Cadw's life, part two, the inner voice. The dawn is at hand into new and uncharted waters, through thick and thin, through rough and smooth. Listen and hear my voice.
2390000	2406000	On, literally, you can witness it, charred paper. It is charred paper. It is charred paper. There you are. That's what's come out of the ashes. That's what speaks.
2406000	2435000	Terry Gilby, again, the other night. I don't know Terry. I only know what I saw of him on the other night. I don't know if he's here tonight or not, but he brought back to him on this to put him again. How does this foundation serve the world today and into the future? How does this foundation, how does this community,
2435000	2454000	serve the world today and into the future? Because if you can identify what you can serve, what you are called to serve, then the way the truth and the life will open to you.
2454000	2483000	And that's the deeper level of the ddama created, the field of the ddama, on which the battlefield of life and what came to pass, Sanjaya, takes place. Who was Sanjaya? Sanjaya was the equal-eyed charioteer of the blind king's leadership, because political power or bureaucratic power is always blind.
2485000	2502000	Those who have to administer a place like this have to focus their energies on balancing the books and the marketing and getting people in and all the rest of it. They may not have the same opportunity to connect in so much with that deeper spiritual order.
2502000	2508000	But it's so important to understand in the organisation and ecology how that balance is.
2508000	2529000	There were various calls for more democracy, more participation in this fellows' Zoom, and people expressing frustration at not just in Fenton, but elsewhere, Orwell, etc., struggling to find ways forward by which that was possible.
2530000	2549000	The age-old question of how do you balance the need for certain types of professional knowledge and responsibility with everybody feeling a part of what is going on, even if they don't agree with it, recognising that it is due process that is taking place.
2550000	2567000	In that respect, I brought with me a book. I always keep a spare copy of this, and my spare copy that I'd given away the last one arrived just before coming here, and it came into me to bring this here and to leave this with you.
2567000	2592000	A book called Beyond Majority Rule brought us decisions in the religious society of friends in the Quakers. This is about Quaker discernment process, where when it is properly held at a gathered meeting, a meeting gathered in nothing less than the Holy Spirit,
2592000	2610000	what is discussed and the decisions made is not about the me, it's not even about the we as different groups in a collective, but it is about discerning the movement of the spirit in that.
2610000	2633000	We discussed it last night, and folk were saying it works better with small groups and large ones, and yet when the Quakers had to decide over whether to acknowledge gay marriage, 600 people with many different views, some strongly against, gathered together and found unity around accepting it.
2633000	2646000	Even though some disagreed, they felt that the sense of the meeting, not that expression, the sense of the meeting was in that direction, and they respected that people thought it.
2646000	2664000	So there you are, Rebecca. I'm going to give you this for it to be used in whatever way might serve the foundation if it does. I've also got some pages again that I can send to you that you might want to circulate so that people know the kind of material that's in that book.
2665000	2683000	I want to move on now with another 10 minutes. I want to take this a bit deeper. I want to take this process of what disarmament is a bit deeper, but it's an uncomfortable place.
2683000	2702000	Although I'm very much on the periphery of your community, just coming here for the guest occasion, and I would be wary of having myself described as new age, especially in some of the kind of circles that I move in.
2702000	2717000	Although in that original sense, William Bloom describes a keyless quote, very much a part of that. Although all of that.
2717000	2746000	When Rebecca asked Anna if I might be freed for this evening to give us sharing, I was quite apprehensive about it, not just because of the sensitivities, but also wondering whether I could really say what perhaps needed to be said.
2747000	2762000	And for the two nights before coming here, I thought, okay, you know, there's the angel of Finthorn, or to put it in my own language, the inner constellation of spiritual forces that hold us together.
2763000	2775000	Let me ask the angel of Finthorn to send me a dream for what I need to share with you. And two nights ago, three nights ago now, no dream.
2776000	2793000	And then the night before last, I was preparing to hit up here. I wake up at 4.30 in the morning and I said, my goodness, I need to get some thoughts down about this before I go.
2793000	2803000	And I worked at my computer, drafting stuff, checking references and books until 7 when I started to get really tired again.
2803000	2810000	I thought, I'll just go back and have an hour. And I woke up at half nine, two and a half hours.
2810000	2822000	And then I realized I'd been having a dream. And the dream was this. It's not a comfortable dream. It was very interesting.
2822000	2833000	I was coming back on the ferry from the island of Lewis with a group of six people, some of them indigenous to the island, others to the tourism.
2833000	2841000	And we're having a merry old time. And the ship was going to make an unscheduled early stop at which we were going to get off.
2841000	2849000	And knowing that, Rebecca and Roy always rescue me from Finthorn veganism when I come here by making a fish...
2849000	2856000	I probably shouldn't have compressed to the fish pie, but if they looked at my phone, they'd see the scales of Mackle.
2857000	2864000	I have to confess what I am and where I'm from and how I am and so on.
2864000	2870000	So fish pie was in my mind. And in the dream, I ordered the fish and chips for everybody before we got off the boat.
2870000	2876000	So we're all getting off the boat without fish suppers to get into the minibus of dinner.
2876000	2881000	And I noticed a device left on our table. I said, oh, that must be one of our people.
2881000	2887000	So I'm heading off and I'm about to go down the gang flank, but suddenly thought comes, maybe it's not one of theirs.
2887000	2893000	Maybe it belongs to one of the crew. So I go back and there's a steward, an island guy, a guy I know.
2893000	2897000	I said to him, this isn't yours by any chance. He said, oh yes, that's mine.
2897000	2902000	I said, what is it? And he switched it on and messages started flowing down.
2902000	2905000	He said, that's how I communicate with the captain.
2911000	2915000	So this is about communicating with that sense of higher power.
2917000	2922000	The dream then cut to the show and there was my former student Ian McKinnon,
2925000	2929000	a tradition bearer from the Isle of Skye, who's we've been referring to today.
2930000	2934000	And he was tending a flower bed, a raised flower bed,
2934000	2938000	or the probonad.
2938000	2945000	And he was planting it out beautifully with all kinds of flowers and shrubs that were indigenous to the place.
2947000	2951000	And he completed his work and walked off down to the seashore.
2951000	2958000	But then somebody came along with a kind of agitated energy
2958000	2966000	who was obviously a stranger to the place and started pulling out the shrubs and plants,
2966000	2972000	intending to replant them with stuff that did not belong in the place, that was not indigenous to the place.
2972000	2979000	And I said, hey, stop. Ian's planted it like Ian has planted it like that for a reason.
2980000	2986000	And the man wandered off and I replanted Ian's flowers.
2988000	2991000	This is about becoming indigenous to place.
2992000	2997000	The way I have always seen Findhorn, notwithstanding what I confess,
2997000	3002000	many of us in Scotland sometimes speak of as its wackiness,
3003000	3009000	notwithstanding the wacky elements of Findhorn, the way I have always seen it,
3009000	3016000	is it coming from California, from Germany, from Australia, from wherever it is you're coming from.
3016000	3023000	Many of you are of the diaspora that left this country in the time of the enclosures in England
3023000	3028000	or the clearances in Scotland, and you're coming back bearing gifts.
3028000	3034000	Hence the importance of, say, the work you've done in eco-architecture, in energy and so on.
3034000	3042000	No, it was wonderful to see Findhorn featured on the front cover of one of the IPCC's most recent scientific books.
3042000	3046000	That's a real accolade of what you've achieved there.
3048000	3054000	And yet I would suggest that there is a need now for the new age, whatever you want to call it,
3054000	3059000	to be grounded in place, to re-indigenise, to be.
3059000	3067000	Indigenous does not necessarily mean to be native, but it means to come to belong to a place.
3068000	3073000	Finally, we went down to the shore, where to cut the story short.
3073000	3080000	A stranger came and took my fishing line from me, cast it out, and pulled in two big black fish,
3080000	3085000	which I knew we had to eat, and yet I felt queasy about it.
3085000	3089000	It's a recurrent tree in my house, I call it my jellyfish.
3089000	3098000	It represents both my shadow in the Jungian sense, and the shadow of situations that I am in these days.
3098000	3103000	That part of the dream said, we have to process our shadow.
3103000	3111000	We have to catch our shadow, we have to consume our shadow, we have to integrate it in.
3111000	3115000	So you had the sense on the boat of being in touch.
3115000	3119000	I would suggest that there is divine energy.
3119000	3123000	You had the sense of re-indigenisation with Ian's planting out,
3123000	3128000	but also being aware that not everybody understands that process and its importance,
3128000	3133000	and you had the sense of integrating the shadow.
3133000	3138000	Finally, Jung's favourite story was a rainmaker.
3138000	3141000	I'm sure many of you who look here know it.
3141000	3144000	I use it frequently.
3144000	3149000	It was told to him by the German translator and missionary Richard Bielholm,
3149000	3157000	who was a missionary in China in the 1920s, or before that, before the First World War,
3157000	3162000	and into the start of the First World War.
3162000	3167000	While he was there, there was a terrible drought in the process.
3167000	3173000	The plants started to die, the animals started to die, the people knew that they would be next.
3173000	3181000	In their desperation, they went to the Protestant missionaries and asked for prayers.
3181000	3190000	The Protestant missionaries came and made their prayers and interminably long sermons.
3190000	3195000	Then they went to the Catholics, and the Catholics came and sprinkled holy water
3195000	3202000	and possessed round with statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and whatever they would be doing.
3202000	3204000	I'm still no rain.
3204000	3208000	Then they went to their own indigenous Taoist and Confucian shamans,
3208000	3213000	and they came and set off fireworks and fired guns into the air to frighten off the evil spirits
3213000	3218000	that had caused the drought, but still no rain.
3218000	3224000	Finally, Bielholm told you, are the last resort interesting, the last resort.
3224000	3226000	Why is the last resort?
3226000	3234000	Because if they would reflect most fully on themselves, they would have to eat that jelly fish.
3234000	3237000	They called him the Rainmaker.
3237000	3244000	The Rainmaker was a wizened little old man who came from a neighbouring province.
3244000	3246000	When he arrived, they asked him what he needed.
3246000	3250000	He said, I just need a hut to go and sit in.
3250000	3254000	He went and sat in the hut for three days and three nights,
3254000	3261000	so after there was an unseasonable heavy fall of snow which melted to yield rain,
3261000	3265000	and the drought was relieved.
3265000	3272000	The Chinese picked to go back to business, but Bielholm, being not just a professor,
3272000	3283000	not just any old professor, but a German professor, wanted to know what had happened.
3283000	3287000	One of those wonderful missionaries who had never made any converse,
3287000	3294000	translated the I Ching in the version many of you will know as Well of the Doubt I Ching,
3294000	3301000	which is also a wonderful version in its talk of the man of calling, or the person of calling,
3301000	3305000	the person who beats the doubt.
3305000	3308000	And the Rainmaker said, I did nothing, I just sat in the hut.
3308000	3310000	Oh, come on, says Bielholm, you must have done something.
3310000	3312000	Was it magic spells, incantations?
3312000	3315000	No, no magic spells, no incantations.
3315000	3318000	Well, what was it, said Bielholm, getting persuaded.
3318000	3324000	I'll tell you what it was, said the Rainmaker, when I came here.
3324000	3328000	When I left my province, my spirit was in the doubt, in the drama,
3328000	3337000	in the way, the truth, in the life, in the Buddha nature, with a laugh.
3337000	3342000	But when I got here, I found my spirit was no longer in the doubt.
3342000	3346000	So I went and sat in the hut, and after three days and three nights,
3346000	3353000	my spirit came back into the doubt, and that's when the rain came.
3353000	3358000	Friends, I leave it with you, the indigenous people of this land,
3358000	3370000	and I watch for you here, like Ian McKinnon, like Mary Campbell, comes here.
3370000	3373000	They have set out a flower bed for you.
3373000	3379000	You have also brought your own plants, some of which harmonise very beautifully in.
3379000	3383000	You have brought gifts back from the diaspora.
3383000	3394000	The task before you now, after the fire, is to be in the doubt so that the rain comes,
3394000	3401000	and the drought is relieved, so that God is no longer alone.
3401000	3409000	You are no longer alone, but you are together in a position where, as a community,
3409000	3421000	you can discern decisions under the guidance of that spirit, which is holy,
3421000	3427000	and become conscious of the openings of the way that this beautiful place
3427000	3434000	might continue to serve for the world today and in the future.
3434000	3436000	Thank you.
3436000	3449000	APPLAUSE
3449000	3458000	Can I have this set up in the box, which you are on this?
3458000	3463000	So, in a moment, if you are wanting to make a comment or ask a question,
3463000	3468000	there will be somebody bringing Mike Rounding back to you.
3468000	3477000	So, you might be as if you'd like to respond or ask a question please later on.
3477000	3483000	Chris, it's okay. There's one hardwired into the system up there, so I'm hearing things.
3483000	3487000	Chris, it's okay for you.
3487000	3494000	Thank you. Thank you.
3494000	3497000	Tis, thank you very much Alistair.
3497000	3501000	I found that very moving and very profound for us as a community.
3501000	3516000	My question to you really is, I heard you talk about grounding and becoming native to place.
3516000	3522000	Sorry, becoming indigenous to place, and I have my understanding of that,
3522000	3528000	but I'd really love to hear more about what you feel that really means for us.
3528000	3536000	Thank you for that question and just what we will, what we spent today discussing.
3536000	3542000	For the last 19 years I've lived in Governan, Glasgow,
3542000	3548000	to the Hartfest, a former shipbuilding area of Glasgow.
3548000	3553000	Sorry, just having published my sign there.
3553000	3558000	We were invited by people from that area and from Pollock,
3558000	3561000	who had been involved in 1990s motorway protests.
3561000	3567000	The M77 Pollock Free State campaign had the beautiful BBC documentary
3567000	3574000	called The Birdman of Pollock on YouTube about it.
3574000	3579000	When the motorway protest came to an end in the mid 1990s, Colin McLeod, the founder, said,
3579000	3586000	okay, we've shown them what we're against, now let's show them what we're for.
3586000	3590000	Let's take the defeat of the motorway being driven through Pollock Park,
3590000	3595000	but turn it into something beautiful.
3595000	3600000	He showed me a Scottish history book that used the term Gal Gale,
3600000	3604000	to speak of the people of the outer Hebrides, known as Finnish Gal,
3604000	3608000	or Galloway, or Galway in Ireland,
3608000	3614000	meaning the people who are strangers, strange or foreign gales.
3614000	3617000	These are the people where the Norse have come down
3617000	3624000	and mixed their blood with the garlic blood, so you had a hybrid people.
3624000	3628000	He said, well, that's how it is for so many people in Glasgow today.
3628000	3632000	None of us are pure this or that in terms of ethnic identity,
3632000	3634000	in terms of native identity.
3634000	3636000	There's a bit of this and a bit of that.
3636000	3638000	My mother's English, my father's Scottish,
3638000	3640000	my Scottish father has roots in the border
3640000	3645000	and roots some of them around here and so on.
3645000	3648000	We are all Gal Gales now.
3648000	3657000	That sense of coming to belong is what it's about.
3657000	3660000	It's expressed in our poetry, Robert Byrne,
3660000	3663000	a man to man for all that, for all that, and all that.
3663000	3665000	It's coming yet for all that, that man to man,
3665000	3670000	the world around, our brother's people, all that.
3670000	3673000	Amy Tenderson and the alternative Scottish national anthem,
3673000	3676000	the freedom to come all ye, black and white in,
3676000	3680000	we either marry it, black and white will marry each other.
3680000	3684000	It's in our proverbs, Alexander Carmichael cites one,
3684000	3690000	the bonds of blood are worth 30 fold,
3690000	3695000	the bonds of milk in other words nurture 100 fold,
3695000	3699000	because in the Celtic tradition there are two sacred duties,
3699000	3703000	hospitality for the short term
3703000	3707000	and postorship or adoption for the long term.
3707000	3711000	I have one of my poems in Love and Revolution
3711000	3716000	called Scotland, they showed a person belongs
3716000	3720000	in as much as he a willing, in as much as he a willing
3720000	3728000	to cherish and be cherished by this place and its people.
3728000	3730000	This is about the heart.
3730000	3734000	This is not about, I didn't call my best known book,
3734000	3736000	Love and Soil.
3736000	3739000	I called it Soil and Soul,
3739000	3742000	to which Satish Kumar said to me, we could add another one
3742000	3744000	and make it Soil, Soul and Society,
3744000	3748000	which is one of his recent books.
3748000	3750000	How do you do that in practice?
3750000	3753000	You first of all do it by welcoming in the stranger
3753000	3756000	on a basis of hospitality.
3756000	3758000	And then I would be quite blunt and say,
3758000	3762000	you show the stranger what it means to be a good guest,
3762000	3766000	because it doesn't work if the guests take over the guest house.
3766000	3769000	It doesn't work if the guests take over the guest house.
3769000	3772000	There needs to be a mutual respect
3772000	3776000	until the community can grow as a result of new ideas
3776000	3778000	and new blood coming in.
3778000	3783000	That becomes its strength, but also it holds cohesion.
3783000	3785000	What is its cohesion?
3785000	3789000	Its cohesion is ultimately the God-given dynamic
3789000	3792000	of what it means to be a community or place
3792000	3795000	in that particular bio-region.
3795000	3798000	How do you do that in practice and Gal Gael
3798000	3801000	if you come and visit us as a community meal every Thursday night?
3801000	3805000	We do it by sharing food, music, poetry, song, story.
3805000	3808000	We do it by having a workshop where people build boats
3808000	3811000	and they get out rowing boats and so on.
3811000	3816000	People like Madge come and visit us and educate us with songs.
3816000	3818000	That's how we do it.
3818000	3821000	Much as you do it here in this universal home,
3821000	3823000	that's why it's such a privilege.
3828000	3830000	Next person, just put your hand up
3830000	3832000	and the microphone will go to you.
3841000	3855000	Robbie Burns
3855000	3867000	talked about being in the world without a friend
3868000	3877000	was an expression that Robbie Burns used to describe that sense of alienation
3877000	3880000	in the world that was being created,
3880000	3886000	maybe partly because it was a very alienating cosmology
3886000	3890000	that was being brought into the world at that time.
3890000	3896000	I wondered whether you had any thoughts about the new cosmology
3896000	3901000	that might be emerging to bring it all together.
3901000	3903000	Obviously you've been talking about it.
3903000	3906000	I feel implicitly tonight,
3906000	3912000	but the word cosmology comes to my mind as a sort of framework to live by.
3912000	3915000	I wonder if you have any comments on that.
3915000	3928000	I'm just pulling up the point.
3928000	3930000	My hearing is being fixed,
3930000	3934000	and I'm missing about my phone settings.
3934000	3938000	This is Robbie Burns' poem of Youngstras Elan
3938000	3944000	after the Highland troops had been defeated at Caloddon.
3944000	3946000	It's not that far from here.
3946000	3949000	This is Dros Elan, the young chief's meditation.
3949000	3951000	Pick of snipes around my dwelling.
3951000	3956000	Howling tempers soar me row.
3956000	3959000	Turbid torrents, wintree's welling,
3959000	3961000	roving by my lonely cave.
3961000	3963000	Crystal streamlets gently flowing.
3963000	3965000	Busy hawns of baseman kind.
3965000	3967000	Western breezes softly blowing.
3967000	3970000	Suit not my destructive mind.
3970000	3973000	He's no longer able to connect with nature.
3973000	3975000	It suits not his destructive mind
3975000	3979000	because of the calamity that's come upon them.
3979000	3982000	In the cause of right engage.
3982000	3983000	Engaged.
3983000	3986000	Wrongs injurious to address.
3986000	3988000	Honest war was strongly waged,
3988000	3991000	but the heavens denied success.
3991000	3994000	Ruins wheel has written the words.
3994000	3996000	Not a hope that they've attained.
3996000	3999000	The wide world is all before us,
3999000	4002000	but a world without a friend.
4002000	4005000	So, in the Galgail Trust, many of our people
4005000	4007000	have multiple issues, homelessness,
4007000	4010000	addictions, mental health issues,
4010000	4013000	in and out of prison.
4013000	4017000	Multiple dynamics by which poverty
4017000	4021000	plays itself out.
4021000	4023000	And deepest of all in that is
4023000	4026000	profound loneliness.
4026000	4029000	I'm not sure if you can see
4029000	4031000	and deepest of all in that is
4031000	4034000	profound loneliness.
4034000	4037000	That book is called alone with the alone.
4037000	4039000	To be alone with the divine,
4039000	4042000	but when you are alone with the divine,
4042000	4045000	you are with cosmic presence.
4045000	4048000	If you haven't had an opportunity to connect with that,
4048000	4051000	if you've perhaps been subjected to spiritual abuse,
4051000	4053000	like cultic forms of religion,
4053000	4057000	or hardline, health-out-reven forms of religion,
4057000	4060000	you get cut off from that.
4060000	4062000	And so, in Writers and the Storm,
4062000	4064000	my most recent open climate change,
4064000	4067000	I end up talking about the Four Seas,
4067000	4070000	as clearance when people were disconnected
4070000	4073000	from their indiginality by being cleared from the land,
4073000	4075000	and today kept off the land,
4075000	4077000	unless you've got money, it's very hard
4077000	4080000	to be able to afford to live in rural areas.
4080000	4083000	Clearance collapse,
4083000	4086000	the psychological collapse
4086000	4088000	that brings about, the spiritual collapse,
4088000	4091000	like you've just heard in that poem,
4091000	4094000	that even the beauties of nature
4094000	4097000	no longer suit whose distracted mind,
4097000	4099000	the wide world is all before me,
4099000	4101000	the world of empires is all before me,
4101000	4103000	but a world without a friend.
4103000	4106000	And the third seed, consumption,
4106000	4109000	when we can't get no satisfaction
4109000	4112000	in the world,
4112000	4114000	because we're cut off from our ability
4114000	4117000	to find authentic satisfaction,
4117000	4119000	we look for satisfaction,
4119000	4121000	not by true satisfies,
4121000	4123000	but by false satisfies,
4123000	4125000	and that drives consumerism,
4125000	4127000	which drives climate change,
4127000	4129000	and then the Four Seas,
4129000	4131000	the antidote to it, community.
4131000	4134000	I consider the single most important work
4134000	4137000	that any of us can do in the face of climate change,
4137000	4139000	in the face of poverty,
4139000	4142000	in the face of war and other such related matters,
4142000	4144000	is to hold for Takapama,
4144000	4146000	the American Quake,
4146000	4150000	it calls spaces for spitable to the soul.
4150000	4152000	It's not my business to tell you
4152000	4155000	what you should be doing at Fenton,
4155000	4157000	but if it was,
4157000	4159000	if I was one of you,
4159000	4161000	my difference was
4161000	4164000	what I've been discerning over these last few days
4164000	4166000	as I've prepared for this talk
4166000	4170000	would be to suggest that the most fundamental thing here
4170000	4172000	is that you hold spaces
4172000	4175000	that are hospitable to the soul,
4175000	4180000	where pilgrims can come from afar,
4180000	4182000	who need physical presence,
4182000	4185000	who need a place to stay and rest,
4185000	4187000	affordably,
4187000	4189000	who need the hospitality,
4189000	4191000	at least for the short term,
4191000	4196000	if not the hostorship for the long term,
4196000	4199000	who need the music, song, story,
4199000	4201000	the love that you can offer here.
4201000	4203000	I walk through this space,
4203000	4205000	I see a lot of love manifested in it,
4205000	4207000	the way your houses are,
4207000	4209000	the way people interact,
4209000	4212000	the way the gardens are and so on.
4212000	4214000	When I was in Papua New Guinea,
4214000	4216000	where I learned so much
4216000	4218000	of these things of a young man,
4218000	4220000	I was there for four years,
4220000	4222000	Sir Bernard Naracobi,
4222000	4226000	who was then the Minister for Justice,
4226000	4228000	and with a trustee of the organisation
4228000	4229000	I worked for,
4229000	4232000	the South Pacific Appropriate Technology Foundation,
4232000	4234000	had a poem that I often used,
4234000	4236000	I used it for the group today.
4239000	4242000	And the black-skinned area of the Pacific
4242000	4244000	is called Melanesia,
4244000	4246000	I was just thinking from Micronesia,
4246000	4249000	so we'll talk about Melanesian people.
4253000	4257000	Welcome to the University of Melanesia,
4257000	4261000	the ancient, timeless, eternal
4261000	4265000	University of Melanesia,
4265000	4270000	the village where courses are offered in living.
4273000	4276000	Welcome to the University of Scotland,
4276000	4280000	the ancient, timeless, eternal University of Scotland,
4280000	4285000	the village where courses are offered in living.
4285000	4287000	You know, if you fork in the future,
4287000	4289000	if you look towards the future,
4289000	4291000	if you can simply create simple structures,
4291000	4294000	I would say she has radical simplicity,
4294000	4297000	radical simplicity,
4297000	4302000	by which and through which,
4302000	4304000	in ways formal and informal,
4304000	4307000	you can offer courses in living.
4310000	4312000	Then that new age,
4313000	4316000	then that new age turns another leaf
4316000	4318000	and finds another breath of life.
4320000	4322000	Thank you for that question.
4323000	4325000	How's our time, Rebecca?
4327000	4329000	Another 15, excellent.
4329000	4332000	So, there's a hand up at the back there.
4332000	4333000	Thank you for...
4336000	4338000	Chris, when you were a student,
4338000	4340000	I never knew you could be as useful as this.
4340000	4342000	Thank you very much.
4342000	4344000	I mean, I wish we could turn back...
4344000	4346000	I wish we could turn back the clock and...
4349000	4351000	Please, my friend, yes.
4351000	4352000	Hang on, wait a minute.
4352000	4354000	I'd like to just turn you back on here.
4356000	4358000	Wrong one.
4358000	4360000	I'll speak to these.
4360000	4364000	I'm wondering if you could speak to
4364000	4367000	processes that support
4367000	4370000	looking at the shadow in community.
4371000	4373000	So, processes, yes.
4373000	4375000	Just your thoughts.
4375000	4376000	Thank you.
4380000	4381000	Well...
4387000	4389000	I need to fiddle with my back
4389000	4391000	in this other way.
4393000	4395000	I defend myself as my own voice coming
4395000	4397000	with a slight delay.
4406000	4408000	Did you notice how I'm telling you about
4408000	4410000	the third part of that dream?
4410000	4412000	Let me unpack it a bit more
4412000	4414000	of what happened in that dream,
4414000	4418000	because I was shorting it each time.
4418000	4420000	So, I went down to the pier
4420000	4423000	and recently I've been taking young families
4423000	4425000	out canoe fishing
4425000	4427000	in what I call my dugouts,
4427000	4429000	or wherever in my dugouts.
4429000	4431000	We've got two inflatable canoes.
4431000	4433000	Wonderful things.
4433000	4435000	I've been taking them out fishing
4435000	4437000	in the Firth of Clyde
4437000	4439000	and in the Firth of Forth of Kinghorn,
4439000	4441000	while the mackerel have been in.
4443000	4446000	Substantially, to help them ground in place.
4446000	4449000	The other day, family, she's German,
4449000	4451000	she's Chilean,
4451000	4454000	hoping them to ground in place.
4457000	4460000	So, fish has been on my mind a lot, just now.
4463000	4466000	It's not surprising that fish came so strongly in the dream.
4466000	4468000	But what happened in the third part?
4468000	4471000	After me-planting Ian's flowerbed,
4471000	4474000	I wandered down to the pier,
4474000	4476000	and I'm thinking, because the mackerel are in,
4476000	4478000	I'll probably catch them off the pier.
4478000	4480000	I've got my hand lying with me
4480000	4482000	and I go down
4482000	4485000	and I take the lead weight with the two mackerel feathers on it.
4485000	4487000	I only use two when I'm in the canoe,
4487000	4489000	so I don't puncture it too often.
4489000	4492000	It's not too great when you're out half a mile off shore
4492000	4494000	and you've got an inflatable canoe.
4494000	4496000	I have to bring out a little hand pump, of course.
4496000	4498000	The other day it happened,
4498000	4500000	I've got a puncture, so it would be kind of
4500000	4503000	pump-worn, catch-worn, pump-worn, catch-worn,
4503000	4506000	and that way we kept it satisfactory.
4506000	4509000	So I threw out the hand line on the pier.
4510000	4512000	And I felt a heavy weight on the end,
4512000	4514000	and I pulled it in, and I thought,
4514000	4516000	this feels like an unusual fish.
4516000	4518000	And up came this very beautiful,
4518000	4520000	but frightening fish.
4520000	4522000	And it was a long fish,
4522000	4524000	and it was covered in colourful
4524000	4527000	spines like a sea urchin.
4527000	4529000	Now, remember your question,
4529000	4531000	which is about process,
4531000	4533000	for dealing with the shadow.
4533000	4536000	It was covered in colourful spines like a sea urchin.
4536000	4539000	I half knew its name,
4539000	4542000	of course, because it's of another manifestation of
4542000	4544000	your spacefully the jellyfish,
4544000	4546000	which comes to me in different forms
4546000	4548000	and dreams at different times.
4548000	4552000	So, on this occasion, it's colourful, but scary fish,
4552000	4554000	and it will foul hook it through the back.
4554000	4556000	So I thought, I'm going to take the hook out
4556000	4558000	and I'm going to throw it back into the sea.
4558000	4560000	It's probably edible, but something in me
4560000	4562000	felt icky about...
4562000	4565000	I mean, that's always a sign about your stuff.
4566000	4569000	And it's about interaction of shadows.
4572000	4574000	So I did this, but while I was
4574000	4576000	sewing this fish back,
4576000	4579000	another stranger came,
4579000	4582000	and he had a rather rakish appearance,
4582000	4584000	rather casual appearance,
4584000	4586000	and without asking, he took my fishing line
4586000	4588000	and he threw it in
4588000	4590000	and pulled in these fish,
4590000	4593000	which are these two big black
4593000	4595000	saith of cold fish
4595000	4600000	that I mentioned.
4601000	4603000	And then I woke up
4603000	4605000	and I realised that
4605000	4607000	all three of those fish
4607000	4610000	had been manifestations of the shadow.
4610000	4612000	The first one was all prickly.
4612000	4614000	It was beautiful, but it was prickly.
4614000	4616000	If you're going to have the beauty,
4616000	4618000	you have to accept that the prickliness
4618000	4620000	is going to come with it.
4620000	4622000	And the second one,
4622000	4624000	I knew we had to eat it.
4624000	4626000	I showed the man who had taken my line,
4626000	4628000	I showed him how to kill it,
4628000	4630000	how to kill both of them,
4630000	4632000	because we were going to take them back
4632000	4634000	and we were going to eat them.
4634000	4637000	Now, why have I told you about that dream?
4637000	4639000	Because where are you?
4639000	4641000	Yes, thank you.
4641000	4643000	Why have I told you about that dream?
4643000	4645000	Part of the reason why
4645000	4648000	am I moving out to the site of the zoom here?
4648000	4651000	Part of the reason why
4651000	4654000	is to model being able to talk about our shadows
4654000	4658000	and how we interact with the shadows.
4658000	4660000	So how do you do it?
4660000	4662000	You talk about your jellyfishies
4662000	4664000	or whatever it is.
4664000	4666000	And so you set what in Quakerism
4666000	4668000	we call patterns and examples
4668000	4670000	of ways of doing things.
4670000	4672000	A pattern,
4672000	4674000	a way of doing things.
4674000	4677000	An example, a case study,
4677000	4679000	like I've just given to you.
4679000	4681000	You create a climate
4681000	4683000	in which it can be comfortable
4683000	4687000	to talk about these things.
4687000	4689000	Now, one of the things that that achieves,
4689000	4691000	if it is well held,
4691000	4694000	if the space is well held,
4694000	4696000	and by well held,
4696000	4698000	I mean being held in that place
4698000	4700000	of prayer or contemplation,
4700000	4704000	being held in that God space.
4704000	4706000	If it is well held,
4706000	4708000	if the facilitator
4708000	4710000	or others in the group
4710000	4712000	keeps calling people back
4712000	4714000	to the God given intention
4714000	4717000	that they are there for,
4717000	4719000	then you will be able to do it
4719000	4721000	in a way that processes it.
4721000	4723000	Colin McLeod, the co-founder
4723000	4726000	of the Gal Gale, used to put it,
4726000	4728000	shit happens,
4728000	4731000	what matters is how you shovel it.
4731000	4734000	And in my view, with land reform,
4734000	4736000	the single most important thing
4736000	4738000	that communities need to learn
4738000	4740000	is how to shovel shit.
4740000	4742000	Because when you shovel shit,
4742000	4744000	as you well know, you may compost.
4744000	4746000	But if you don't shovel the shit,
4746000	4748000	the shit just stinks,
4748000	4751000	causes illness.
4751000	4754000	So I would suggest these are the kind of ways
4754000	4756000	you talk about it.
4756000	4758000	But what is so often missing,
4758000	4760000	including in right-on communities,
4760000	4763000	including in Christian groups and so on,
4764000	4767000	what is so often missing
4767000	4770000	is holding it in that divine fire,
4770000	4774000	and calling it back to that God's peace,
4774000	4776000	as I call it.
4776000	4779000	I think this is why a lot of process-related stuff
4779000	4781000	goes wrong.
4781000	4783000	Because people are trying to do it
4783000	4785000	at the level of the head and the heart and the hand.
4785000	4787000	But they're forgetting,
4787000	4791000	they're forgetting the device,
4791000	4793000	that the chief steward
4793000	4795000	on the log C-force had,
4795000	4798000	by which he communicated to the captain.
4798000	4801000	I know that's a hierarchical model of the divine,
4801000	4804000	and you all know it doesn't work like that.
4804000	4806000	The divine emerges from within.
4806000	4809000	But we're talking about how dreams use symbolism.
4809000	4812000	So that will be probably as much as I could suggest
4812000	4815000	to you just now.
4815000	4818000	Keep holding it in the fire.
4818000	4821000	If you don't hold it in the fire of God,
4821000	4823000	the fire of people's shadow
4823000	4826000	will burn those around them.
4826000	4829000	If you hold it in the fire of God,
4829000	4832000	you will help others together, collectively,
4832000	4835000	to process, to recognise the shadow,
4835000	4837000	and to process it.
4837000	4840000	Conflict is normal in healthy communities,
4840000	4843000	but it must be recognised and processed.
4843000	4846000	Judith, he was very good at doing that.
4846000	4848000	Judith is really impressive
4848000	4850000	from what I've seen of her work.
4850000	4853000	It was a joy being his mind.
4853000	4855000	No, I just wanted to share.
4855000	4858000	I have such a powerful memory
4858000	4860000	of Dorothy and Irene,
4860000	4862000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4862000	4865000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4865000	4867000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4867000	4869000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4869000	4871000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4871000	4874000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4874000	4876000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4876000	4878000	sitting in a Monday evening,
4878000	4881000	sharing with us the shadow of their legacies.
4881000	4884000	sharing with us the shadow of their legacies.
4884000	4887000	Irene said it was the self-sacrifice
4887000	4890000	that went as far as martyrdom,
4890000	4893000	and Dorothy said it was not standing up
4893000	4896000	for herself with Peter.
4896000	4900000	Peter wasn't in the community at the time,

5061540	5063660	I've lost my track as to why I got there.
5063860	5065340	Yeah, yeah, basically.
5065540	5069500	But basically I caught one of the elders in the group before I left and said,
5069700	5073140	you know, could you just check in with that person?
5073340	5077740	Because I think that had I had more time, she would have wanted to have it out
5077940	5080580	with me and there's not been that opportunity.
5080780	5086540	So could you just could you let her know that I picked up the vibe from her?
5086740	5091220	It was not the place for me to justify the kind of person I am.
5091380	5093300	Oh, yeah, I know where I was getting to.
5093500	5095460	But the other thing is the other thing
5095660	5100780	to this is that I get people say to me and you will well understand why if you're
5100980	5104220	a vegetarian or vegan, which many of you probably are, say,
5104420	5107780	Alistair, how can you still eat meat?
5107980	5111300	How can you still go fishing?
5111500	5115580	To which my answer is folks, I just do.
5115780	5121180	And if I try to suppress that in myself, it's it's not going to work.
5121780	5123420	But notice how I acknowledge it.
5123620	5127700	I acknowledge that aspect of what some of you might see and which that young
5127900	5131260	woman today probably saw as being my shadow.
5131460	5135660	We can one of the ways we can help open this ground
5135860	5144140	is by acknowledging aspects of ourselves that we know others might have difficulty.
5144340	5150140	Then feel a sense of relief being slight.
5151220	5156780	Any more one up there?
5156980	5158780	Oh, somebody's got the bike already.
5158980	5159980	Yeah, hang on.
5160180	5160980	Wait, let's switch.
5161180	5162180	Oh, yeah.
5162380	5164980	Alistair, we've just got two minutes.
5165180	5168700	Is it two minutes?
5168900	5171180	Yep, I think we should don't have time to.
5171380	5174980	Well, it takes us to the last one and.
5176500	5180140	OK, that's come out of Alistair.
5180860	5184980	Annwyr a hamelag ancien a hamelaigio.
5185180	5187060	I don't speak the garlic.
5187260	5193300	I know enough to understand your greeting that part of my own shadow is that in
5193500	5197420	spite of being raised in.
5197620	5204700	Norslox and Lewis, not only don't I speak the garlic, but I have the greatest
5204900	5208020	difficulty in remembering even basic phrases.
5208020	5211420	And I think that's a psychological issue in me.
5211620	5216060	And I've spoken to other people of my generation, some of whom have the same
5216260	5219940	problem too, and mostly we don't talk about it because it is embarrassing.
5220140	5220980	But you know what?
5221180	5224140	Whenever you hit on something that is embarrassing,
5224340	5226580	it's only the ego that's being offended.
5226780	5231220	It's nothing that the fire of hell can't burn off because the fire of love is
5231420	5233940	that which only burns off, which isn't authentic.
5234100	5238380	So I have to acknowledge to you in front of everybody here that I do not
5238580	5243620	actually understand the garlic you have just spoken to me beyond your initial
5243820	5245660	good evening greeting.
5245860	5247940	And me neither.
5248140	5250660	Alistair.
5250860	5255340	But I know that I don't understand it, but I do speak it a little.
5255540	5259180	So when I am weak, I am strong.
5259380	5260780	No.
5260900	5264180	When I am weak, then I am strong.
5264380	5265860	But there we go.
5266060	5267500	Spence, spence of weakness.
5267700	5272860	So the rain maker had no extraordinary power.
5273060	5277420	And yet somehow he constantly did the rain around him.
5277620	5280620	Adrian Rich, the American poet,
5280820	5284540	with Jewish and Scottish Presbyterian roots.
5284740	5287260	My heart is moved by all I cannot change.
5287460	5289020	So much has been destroyed.
5289260	5293100	I have to cast my lot with those who age after age,
5293300	5300060	purposely with no extra ordinary power we constitute today.
5300260	5305180	Your future will be built up from no extra ordinary power.
5305380	5308300	And I'd like to just close, if I may,
5308500	5312780	by reading a part of the poem from R.S. Thomas.
5313780	5318060	I should say that to use my embarrassment with language.
5318260	5322060	I've got the phonetic spelling printed out here.
5322260	5324580	Because it's pronounced double L, E, Y, N.
5324780	5327500	How the heck keeps it on set?
5327700	5330380	Even though my grandmother was of Welsh
5330580	5336620	rooting, the poem is called The Moon in Slain.
5336820	5340460	And if there's any Welsh people here,
5340460	5342940	please don't shout out the correct pronunciation,
5343140	5345740	because my hearing aids are not tuned to you just now.
5345940	5348940	The Moon in Slain.
5352140	5356700	The last part of the Moon of Jesus gives way to the dark.
5356900	5360140	The serpent digests the egg.
5360340	5363740	Here on my knees in this stone church,
5363940	5368860	that is full only of the silent congregation of shepherds.
5368860	5373380	The silent congregation of shadows and the sea sound.
5373580	5376540	It is easy to believe Yates was right.
5376740	5382300	Just as old choirs had not sung, shells have swallowed them.
5382500	5384660	The pied laps of the Bible, the bell
5384860	5389180	fetches no people to the brittle miracle of the bread.
5389380	5396460	The sand is waiting for the running back of the grains in the wall into its blonde glass.
5396660	5398380	Religion is over.
5398380	5401340	Religion is over.
5401540	5405580	And what will emerge from the body of the new moon?
5405780	5408020	No one can say.
5408220	5409740	Religion is over.
5409940	5413620	And what will emerge from the body of the new moon?
5413820	5416540	No one can say.
5416740	5419980	But a voice sounds in my ear.
5420180	5423060	Why so fast mortal?
5423260	5426140	These very seas are baptized.
