Checking COIF/Alastair McIntosh - Discernment - An All Consuming Fire (Universal Hall, Findhorn 11th Sept 2023).txt
 In this two-minute reflection, Alistair speaks about his difficulty with the Welsh language despite being from a bilingual background in Norsloch and Lewis. He acknowledges his embarrassment over not understanding Welsh phrases well, but he also points out that it's the ego that is offended by such weaknesses. He suggests that our vulnerabilities can be strengths because they force us to rely on something greater than ourselves.

He refers to the "rain maker," who had no extraordinary power but was still able to consistently bring rain, as an example of how sometimes our authentic selves, without any special abilities, can achieve what we need. He quotes American poet Adrienne Rich, emphasizing the strength found in acknowledging our limitations and working with what we have.

Alistair then reads a poem by R.S. Thomas called "The Moon in Slain," which reflects on the transition from light to darkness, the process of digestion (perhaps metaphorical for spiritual absorption), and the presence of shepherds and shadows in a stone church by the sea. The poem contemplates the end of religion and the anticipation of what might emerge next, suggesting that even as old forms of religious practice fade, people are once again becoming pilgrims, seeking spiritual connection either in physical places or within themselves.

The reading concludes with a direct appeal to the listener, asking why they rush through life, reminding them that the very seas are baptized and that the essence of faith cannot be undone by time. The poem leaves room for new forms of spirituality to emerge, echoing the idea that even as old structures fade, there is a resurgence of spiritual seeking in modern times.
