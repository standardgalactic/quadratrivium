WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
My name is Rebecca, and it's my very great pleasure to host this evening.

00:09.000 --> 00:21.000
Shortly, we'll start with a few minutes of silence, and then I'll say a few words of introduction to Alistair, for those of you who may not have met him before.

00:21.000 --> 00:33.000
We're starting on time this evening, and we're going to finish on time too, as Alistair will be driving home to Glasgow after the event.

00:33.000 --> 00:47.000
Alistair spent the day working with the Gen Retreat participants and has generously agreed to come and offer this time with the wider community.

00:47.000 --> 00:57.000
And in waving his fee for this event is ensuring that as much as money as possible goes towards the sanctuary rebuilding.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you for this, Alistair.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
Now, if you'd like to get comfortable, I'll just say a few words to lead us into the silence.

01:12.000 --> 01:24.000
Let's spend a few moments gathering ourselves in the silence of our hearts and minds.

01:24.000 --> 01:38.000
Let's welcome our connection with the over-lighting essence of this place, which continues to inspire us in new directions.

01:38.000 --> 01:48.000
Let's be aware of our connection to this land, to the ancestors, to each other.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Draw closer into the silence.

02:08.000 --> 02:21.000
Thank you.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
I'd like to introduce you to Alistair Macintosh.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.000
He is an academic, a teacher, an inspirational speaker and storyteller.

02:34.000 --> 02:45.000
He's written many books and papers, some of which are available here to purchase if you're quick off the mark at the end of the session this evening.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
As a Quaker, he comes from a long tradition of spiritual activism.

02:52.000 --> 03:05.000
I encourage you to look at his website, which is a treasure trove of ideas and offerings exploring many of the urgent issues of our times.

03:05.000 --> 03:14.000
Perhaps more importantly for us tonight, Alistair is a great friend of the Findhorn community.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
He's often spoken at conferences here.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
He is a Findhorn fellow.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
He did a Findhorn TEDx talk, which is well worth finding.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
And he's run week-long programmes, the last one being on spiritual activism.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
I asked him about his first visit here.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
When did he first connect with the community?

03:43.000 --> 04:03.000
And he told me that it was when he was aged 20 in 1976, when he brought a group of fellow students from Aberdeen University to investigate the claims of giant cabbages.

04:03.000 --> 04:16.000
What touched him most in that visit, though, wasn't cabbages, but the building work that was being done on the foundations of this building.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
The whole community took part in the creation of this building. Everybody was involved.

04:24.000 --> 04:37.000
And if they were elderly, perhaps, and they weren't able to carry bricks and planks, then they baked cakes for the tea bloke.

04:37.000 --> 04:47.000
Alistair wrote of that time, we were all embarking on a deep awakening.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
He is a fellow traveller on that path of deep awakening.

04:52.000 --> 05:04.000
Welcome, Alistair, and thank you.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
Thank you so much, Rebecca and Roy, also for hosting me last night.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
I drove up here last night, I've got a very tight schedule just now, and I've arrived just in time for dinner.

05:20.000 --> 05:30.000
I should say I'm, oh hello, Chris. Chris, long ago was one of the students of my wife and I. Nice to see you.

05:30.000 --> 05:42.000
And also, I was delighted to hear that another former student, Sam Graham, has been engaged with John Talbot and some wonderful work here.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
I don't know if he's listening on the Zoom, but if you are, hello, Sam, and I've been hearing great things.

05:49.000 --> 06:00.000
I was just going to say, Chris, I'm making a false start, and this is going to explain what I'm going to be doing tonight and then make a proper start, so to speak.

06:00.000 --> 06:10.000
And what I just need to explain is the reason I've got my phone on my knee here is that I've gone pretty profoundly deaf,

06:10.000 --> 06:21.000
and so I use complex little microphones, got one plugged in up there that feed into my hearing aids by Bluetooth who's here, another emergency one here,

06:21.000 --> 06:31.000
but I control the sound on my own app, so it's not that I'm doing my emails.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
Over end would suggest otherwise, perhaps, but just I'm dealing with that.

06:40.000 --> 06:53.000
When we're doing this discussion, if I don't pick you up right, if I pick you up wrongly, then please, it's not you, it's just a hardware problem and me rather than a software problem in you.

06:54.000 --> 07:06.000
What I'm going to be doing tonight is quite difficult, and I just want to give a bit of a preamble, because I'm here, thanks to, let me just get a surname correctly, thanks to Anna Corfassner.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
Anna Corfassner, who I've just spent a day together with Madge Bray.

07:11.000 --> 07:22.000
You want to just give a wave, Madge, so they can see you. Madge, there's a local tradition there from these parts, somebody you should really know about, who has deeply enriched the day in which we were looking at

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
the indigenous, the group of just over 20 young people over there in Cologne.

07:28.000 --> 07:39.000
So I've been quite pressured in putting this talk together, because I had that to prepare as well as Karen and I going off to our home area in France on Thursdays,

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
so I'd love to do with that, and for that reason, I've been more formally structured in what I'm going to be doing tonight.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
I'm going to be using notes, which I don't usually do, but give me a bit less spontaneous.

07:52.000 --> 08:02.000
It's also quite a library with me, because I may be referring to that in quoting various passages, I'm just giving you a little bit of context.

08:03.000 --> 08:18.000
The biggest thing is that when Anna first invited me, somebody, and I can't find my record so it was contacted me, asking if I would do a talk like this, saying that the Finthhorn community was going through a lot of transition,

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
and given my background, could I come and talk about land reform and appropriate community buyout structures.

08:25.000 --> 08:43.000
Now, I don't know who that person is, but if they are here, my apologies to you, and please understand, the reason I said no was that it's actually none of my business to poke my nose into your business as to what kind of structures and so on you might be looking at.

08:43.000 --> 08:55.000
And I said to Rebecca, I want to be quite careful this evening to try and avoid that ground and in discussion, but I ask you not to lead me into ground that is kind of internal.

08:55.000 --> 09:16.000
Because instead, what I'm going to be doing is that on the 17th of August, I think it was, Roger and Terry, your CEO, organised a Zoom seminar for Finthhorn fellows who were at least 50 of us on it, as to what the changes were.

09:16.000 --> 09:39.000
And I am taking the setting of that Zoom meeting that we had as being the appropriate framework in which for me to speak tonight, not in terms of trying to tell you what we should be doing, but rather to reflect on where we are in these times,

09:39.000 --> 10:03.000
on why it is that what you are going through is far from unique in these times. How that speaks to the condition of these times, as Carl Jung puts it, when the spirit of the death breaks through and interrupts the spirit of the age.

10:03.000 --> 10:17.000
And what callings, what meanings, what promptings, is my point of stories. I'm going to speak for about an hour in total, I want about three and a half hour at the end of the discussion.

10:17.000 --> 10:38.000
The effect of people keeping an eye on time, when we're about three quarters away soon, when we've got about three quarters on our left, give me a re-nudge so I know I've got 15 minutes to wind up, so as to make sure we honour space.

10:38.000 --> 10:53.000
So that's me just setting the parameters. And now, if perhaps I can make a proper start and share with me for a few moments of quicker style stillness.

11:38.000 --> 12:04.000
I've heard from the first verse of the first chapter of the Hindu sacred text, the Bhagavad Gita, which I often use to set the framework to remind us of the framework in which we hold our grounded presence.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Dharma kashetra, on the field of Dharma.

12:11.000 --> 12:19.000
Kua kashetra, on the battlefield of the tribal group known as Rukus.

12:21.000 --> 12:31.000
Sanjaya, the name of the eagle-eyed Sharia pier, of the blind king through to restra.

12:34.000 --> 12:46.000
Wan muskaru, in his wonderful Penguin Classics translation, not the most scholarly translation, but certainly as Ravindra Naskagor recognised.

12:47.000 --> 12:56.000
Muskaru's translations of the Gita and the Pranishads are the most poetic and get most to the spiritual essence of it.

12:57.000 --> 13:11.000
Translate that first line as, on the field of truth, on the field of Dharma, on the battlefield of life, what came to pass Sanjaya.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
There we have nested three levels of reality to take them in reverse order.

13:16.000 --> 13:35.000
Of what came to pass, what happens in the now, on the battlefield of life, in that wider framework of looking at our lives as a whole, consisting of a flow of these present moments of the now.

13:35.000 --> 14:04.000
Dharma kashetra, on the field of truth, on the field of Dharma, held in what I would call the God's Peace, the divine holding of the whole shebang, the present moment of us sitting here tonight, held in the context of our wider lives, held in a universal context that's a pathos understanding of anyone.

14:06.000 --> 14:15.000
When looking at the future of a community, I would suggest holding it at those three levels.

14:16.000 --> 14:29.000
At what it is in practical terms we need to do right now, and to keep the show together, on how that interacts with how we use our lives in service.

14:29.000 --> 14:39.000
And deepest of all, highest of all, what the divine calling of it all is.

14:39.000 --> 14:54.000
As Rebecca said, I came here, first of all, on 2 May 1976, when a retired London banker called John Hilton showed us round.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
He said, well, we're trying to live down the giant cabbages and strawberries.

14:59.000 --> 15:08.000
We're trying to concentrate on the spirituality that we are trying to constantly hear, and that this place concentrates.

15:09.000 --> 15:22.000
And he took us to a building site. It has all sand and building materials, and one hippie sort of people with long golden hair and rippling muscles carrying stuff around.

15:22.000 --> 15:31.000
And John said, here we are building the universal ball, and people will come from all over the world.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Whenever I speak here, I bring with me just as a kind of person.

15:37.000 --> 15:51.000
Hallez man, the book I bought in the Phoenix shop, or have it now is these days, altered states of consciousness edited by Charles T. Tartt, a seminal work to which I still refer in my work.

15:52.000 --> 16:00.000
And the key word there is consciousness, because this is a new age community.

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
I sit within the Quaker tradition, the new age maybe overlaps with that, it's not entirely the same.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
But what is it that we're talking about when we talk about the new age?

16:13.000 --> 16:20.000
I was intrigued, delighted the other day in that Zoom seminar, to see William Bloom there.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
I don't think I've ever met him in person.

16:25.000 --> 16:37.000
But perhaps the most significant book about the new age movement, that's its title, in the UK is by the academic Paul Healus from the Lancaster University Religious Studies Unit.

16:37.000 --> 16:52.000
And I'd just like to read you what he says here, because he's got an appendix here, characterisations of the new age, saying William Bloom's excellent 1992 formulation runs as follows.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
And I'm not going to read you through the two pages of bullet points, but I'm going to read you one of them.

16:59.000 --> 17:10.000
During this period of time, the evolution of the planet and of humanity has reached a point when we are undergoing a fundamental spiritual change in our individual mass consciousness.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
This is why we talk of a new age.

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
This new consciousness is a result of the increasingly successful incarnation of what some people call the energies of cosmic love.

17:23.000 --> 17:36.000
This new consciousness demonstrates itself in an instinctive understanding of the secretness, and in particular the interconnectedness of all existence.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
This is why we talk of a new age.

17:42.000 --> 17:54.000
So, my first time of hearing of Findhorn was actually from our church of Scotland minister, that's the paterian minister, Ardyn Collin McLean, when I was growing up in the Isle of Lewis.

17:55.000 --> 18:07.000
And I can remember conversations in the man's after the Sunday sermon, my father, a doctor in the Isle of Lewis, we had a close social relationship between the two families.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.000
And they would talk about all manner of things, including what was happening at this place called Findhorn.

18:15.000 --> 18:23.000
And that's why I was moved on 2 May 1974 to bring that through from Aberdeen University here, so that we might investigate.

18:24.000 --> 18:30.000
Only to be told it wasn't about giant cabbages so much as about spirituality.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
So what's happened since then?

18:33.000 --> 18:47.000
Since then, over the past 20 years, and this came out strongly in the Fellows Zoom things, I would say that there have been six main changes that have made life more difficult for you now than it was then.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
First of all, there is a sense of mission completed.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
You've got Findhorn spin-offs all over the world.

18:55.000 --> 19:04.000
You look at any academic paper about the so-called New Age, and Findhorn will almost certainly feature prominently in it.

19:05.000 --> 19:15.000
The elders in a sense have done that task that they set out to do in the late 60s, early 70s in that respect.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
But furthermore, the internet means you no longer have to be here.

19:20.000 --> 19:26.000
Hello all of you on Zoom. None of you had to fly into Inverness to hear me tonight, did you?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
But you know what I mean.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
Folks don't have to come in physical presence to a place to have the same experience as they did before.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
Thirdly, in as much as people are conscious, they will be socially and environmentally conscious,

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
and thereby aware of the carbon karma of travel.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
So you have to think, I would say, not a question of not travelling, but think twice about travelling.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
So that will be an added factor. You've got Brexit affecting people's visas.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
You've had the massive knock of COVID, and on top of that you had the fire.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
On top of that you had the fire.

20:15.000 --> 20:25.000
Some years ago, when, you must forgive me folks, I'm very badly behaved,

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
I should be referring to Judas as my focaliser when I come here, but out of necessity I always caught my mind.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
And I was running, of course, in spiritual activism, the spiritual basis of activism.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
And I happened to be sharing a bungalow with a wonderful man, a former director of education here,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Michael Lindfield, who is one of the Ffintan Fellows.

20:54.000 --> 21:02.000
And I wrote to him on the 11th of August prior to the Fellows' Meeting.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
I wrote to him reflecting on where things are at now, because it doesn't just affect you, it affects Schumacher College,

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
it affects the Iona community with which I'm closely associated, it affects all of these kinds of things.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
And we have an email discussion of what is going on. I'd like to read you from his email with his permission.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Yes, our God is an all-consuming fire.

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
In the lineage here at Meditation Mount, the Roberto Assaggi, only inspired.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Marilyn, of course, had he worked closely with Assaggi only.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
I was delighted to hear that it was apparently so deaf, he didn't even try to use gismos like this,

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
it probably didn't exist then, but he had his questions written down and so on, and yet he's still managed.

21:55.000 --> 22:11.000
In our lineage here at Meditation Mount, transformation is described as a shifting consciousness from one state to a new level of beingness through the agency of fire, the italicisers.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
I believe that the original forms of communal living created at Ffintan have to be recycled and out of this natural state of temporary chaos,

22:20.000 --> 22:29.000
a new order will be called into being by the note of fiery purpose, as is intentionally sounded.

22:30.000 --> 22:41.000
This compelling call of purpose, this compelling call of purpose, not generational, not strategic plan thinking that,

22:41.000 --> 22:58.000
but heeding a call, a vocation is vocal, it is a call of purpose, is a magnetic appeal that attracts random elements like iron filings and brings them into a new pattern of relationship with others.

22:59.000 --> 23:07.000
Ffintan has gone through the outer fire and now needs to go through the inner fire for deep transformation to take place.

23:08.000 --> 23:33.000
Hence my title this evening, discernment and all-consuming fire, to discern from the Latin die to cut through a diagonal that cuts through and sinair to separate, to cut through and to separate, to separate what is of true spiritual calling from that which is of other forms of calling.

23:34.000 --> 23:42.000
And so Terry Gilby, your CEO, said to the fellows, I want to start with collective consultation.

23:43.000 --> 23:51.000
How does the foundation serve the world today and into the future? And may that be different from how we have done it and are doing it?

23:51.000 --> 24:06.000
And just in reading those words, I realise how potentially explosive that is. I want to start with collective consultation. I've been involved in managing decline in organisations and let me tell you it's a horrible experience.

24:07.000 --> 24:21.000
It's a horrible experience because everybody who's not simply a part of it feels left out in some way and you're there trying to hold it all and balance it all. It's very difficult stuff. It needs skilled holding.

24:22.000 --> 24:43.000
Offs those who are management, managing change, but it also requires holding in a way that keeps on calling those who have got positions of responsibility or trustees or whatever it might be, calling them back to that God-given, higher purpose.

24:43.000 --> 24:55.000
Dharma cieshetwyr in the field of Dharma. What is the field of design calling? That's what the Dharma is, that we are held in.

24:56.000 --> 25:08.000
And so Terry continued, or rather the fellows chat. I take your part in the fellows chat, said the foundation was originally set up to support the impulse manifesting through the community.

25:09.000 --> 25:19.000
Now is a time to let go of the organisational ego, the outward face and listen to the angel of fintone. In the Bible it talks about the angels of the nations.

25:20.000 --> 25:35.000
My late friend, the American theologian Walter Wink talks about the principalities and the powers and the angels being an expression for the interiority, the spiritual inner constellation of things.

25:35.000 --> 25:50.000
By which the Dharma comes through, or in his Christian context, the way, the life and the truths that his Christ comes through in organisational experts.

25:51.000 --> 26:00.000
And that is why Jung said, one does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.

26:01.000 --> 26:10.000
One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.

26:10.000 --> 26:18.000
My source of which is the CG Jung Foundation's Twitter account on 8 September.

26:23.000 --> 26:36.000
Now Jung said, and again this was something, you know the wonderful serendipitys, just day before yesterday a Jungian on Twitter put out this sharing.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.000
From visions notes of a seminar given 1930 to 1934 volume one.

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
Jung said this, when you, because I mean let's be clear folks, you folks are in a very disagreeable situation just now.

26:52.000 --> 27:04.000
Yes, you know, everybody talks optimistically about well the fire cleanser, the phoenix will rise and all the rest of it and yet you know how difficult that is.

27:04.000 --> 27:17.000
But this is what Jung said about such situations. He said, when you get into a disagreeable situation, where you see no opening, no direct path, you assume that you are quite alone with yourself.

27:19.000 --> 27:28.000
You know the military, I give lectures to the military on non-violence and they speak of the loneliness of high command.

27:28.000 --> 27:41.000
The loneliness of when you are carrying things and you can perhaps see things that you can't always share with others, the reasons of confidentiality of whatever people's employment contracts or whatever it might be.

27:42.000 --> 27:54.000
You are in a lonely position. You assume that you are quite alone with yourself in a way to the very good thing that you think so, otherwise you would never make up your mind.

27:54.000 --> 28:15.000
You would remain merely a child. We have to accept that lonely work, that lonely pilgrimage every next step and this is not just those in appointed positions of responsibility.

28:16.000 --> 28:36.000
This applies to every one of us for the reasons that I'm going to be coming to in terms of how to organise a community in a spiritually held place and how every one of us, no matter how insignificant we might feel we are, has a place in holding.

28:37.000 --> 29:03.000
Let's see what else Jung says. He says, you must believe that you are practically alone. At which point I refer to Henri Corbyn's book Alone with the Alone, a very deep study of the Sufism of Ibn Arabi and what Corbyn is saying, I brought these along just to fold them up because I like the physicality of holding a book.

29:03.000 --> 29:12.000
A book is a sacred object in the sense that my ones have written all over and dogged them. What have you done?

29:13.000 --> 29:32.000
Corbyn says, Corbyn, citing Ibn Arabi from the Islamic tradition, speaks about the loneliness of God, speaks about how God prays for the world.

29:32.000 --> 29:42.000
Let's just confine ourselves to this world and let's just confine ourselves to the human world for now rather than widening it out beyond our immediate relics.

29:42.000 --> 29:58.000
God in God alone prays for the world and when we pray with God then we become companions with the divine.

29:59.000 --> 30:25.000
What Dame Julian of Norwich spoke of as a revelation of divine love, such as how divine love happens when we in whether you call it meditation or contemplation or prayer, when we hold or ask to be held in that divine hand,

30:26.000 --> 30:43.000
when we ask for our concerns to be held in that divine hand, when we ask to be held in God's presence and to pray with God for God's work or God's or Allah or Brahman or Dao or Buddha nature.

30:43.000 --> 30:51.000
I don't mind what you call it, forgive me, I'm coming out of my tradition. I'm coming out of my tradition when I'm back on holiday on the Isle of Lewis.

30:51.000 --> 30:59.000
I make a point of going to the local Presbyterian Free Church of Scotland. You'll have heard all about them, Kate Forbes and all of that.

30:59.000 --> 31:11.000
Yes, that is of the church of the community that I was raised in along with the Church of Scotland. I go to their sermons unless they can be very long and sometimes quite hellfire.

31:11.000 --> 31:31.000
But you know what I love about them? I love the long, extemporary prayers because in those prayers, the Minister of the Elders hold the whole community, they summon the whole community, they name people in the community who are struggling with life or have celebrating something in life

31:31.000 --> 31:41.000
and they bring it all before God and ask God to hold this in God's holy hand so that the community is carried.

31:41.000 --> 31:55.000
I see you have Mary Campbell, my friend Mary Campbell coming and playing here. You may not know that her grandfather, her father and mother Archie and Marjorie were Edinburgh or our Edinburgh Quakers.

31:55.000 --> 32:13.000
Her grandfather was Duncan Campbell, an evangelist in the Isle of Lewis in the 1950s, and Duncan Campbell, Mary's grandfather, defined revival as being a community saturated in God.

32:13.000 --> 32:33.000
And what I'm really saying to you, what I'm trying to suggest to Nightford, is that if you're going to get out of this hole and if the phoenix is going to rise, ask yourself, are you open to that being saturated in God?

32:33.000 --> 32:55.000
And if so, how might you express it? There's more on you, I'll leave it there, but I'd just like to mention Winifred Rushford because I stayed at, I had a long association with her daughter Diana Niels, a pregnant called Farm.

32:55.000 --> 33:10.000
And Winifred was a pioneer of New Age in Scotland, particularly through therapeutic work at the Davidson Clinic. She was a psychotherapist. She had been a missionary doctor in India.

33:10.000 --> 33:33.000
And her book, Something is Happening, subtitled Spiritual Awareness and Depth Psychology in the New Age, 1972, there she died at the age of 78. Laurence van der Post through the friend of hers and who stood in for Prince Charles at her funeral, asked her what was the secret of her energy.

33:33.000 --> 33:49.000
She said, I never go against my unconscious. And she met Jung, she tells in that book, page 13, she met Jung when she was at Oxford in 1939, just before the Second World War.

33:49.000 --> 34:05.000
She was speaking to a group of psychiatrists, and Jung said to the psychiatrist, this is your insanity. This is your insanity that you have lost your religion, that you have lost your connection with the divine.

34:05.000 --> 34:28.000
You see what I'm calling to, you see why Michael Linfield resonates with T.S. Eliot in Little Giddings. The only hope or else despair lies in the choice of power to power to be redeemed from fire by fire.

34:29.000 --> 34:48.000
What does that entail? It entails sitting in that oral consuming fire. In the Orthodox Christian tradition, the fire of hell is only the fire of love that can only burn off that which is not authentic to us.

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
Authentic, deeply author coming from the deep self, the way the truth in the life.

34:56.000 --> 35:05.000
So our game needs to be to allow that fire of hell that screws up our plans in life in so many ways.

35:05.000 --> 35:27.000
Come to understand it, the fire of divine love that can't burn out, burn off anything true to us. And that's just why Yates in the Celtic twilight talks about, let me read you the poem right at the end. How's my time? What time are we?

35:28.000 --> 35:42.000
And we'll finish at...excellent, excellent. I've got another 20 minutes of venting. Wonder if, don't tell my wife that, she'll tell me, oh you should stop sooner.

35:43.000 --> 35:57.000
Oh, yes. I've always taken a neighbor. Well, you know the banter we have. You know how we carry on it. I have two minds of life. One is in Finthbone here and the other is back in Glasgow. It's for rent.

35:58.000 --> 36:21.000
Enter the twilight. Outworn heart in the outworn time. Come clear the nets of the wrong and the right. Come heart where hill is heaped upon hill, for there the mystical brotherhood of hollow wood and hilly wood and the changing moon work out their will and God stands winding his lonely horn.

36:21.000 --> 36:50.000
The time and the world are ever in flight and God stands winding his human, his lonely horn. Again, that alone was the alone that the hands and feet of the divine in this world, our hands and feet. And can we put our weight behind that?

36:51.000 --> 37:12.000
Because if we do at the Doughty Ching, chapter 16, then the myriad creatures all rise together and I watch their return. Returning to one's roots is known as stillness. This is what is meant by returning to one's destiny.

37:12.000 --> 37:29.000
Some years ago, when I was here, Michael Lindfield gave a lecture. It had a mixed reception. He was talking quite a bit about Christianity. He didn't go down well with everybody, just as me talking about it might not go down well with everybody.

37:29.000 --> 37:45.000
But his passion that night that stayed with me was to call the foundation here, or call the community, let me say here, back to its original, God inspired roots. Rebecca, have you got that term?

37:45.000 --> 38:11.000
Can you remember, off-heart, what you rescued from the fire? If I move my microphone, or you've got your own microphone, could you just read it because you rescued this from the fire? Can you make that out? If I hold the mic for you so you can give me the mic?

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
Oh, there we go. Thank you.

38:21.000 --> 38:36.000
When we were clearly enough after the sanctuary fire, we were taking bits and pieces individually in a kind of ritualistic fashion towards the skip that was clearly wide dance.

38:36.000 --> 38:55.000
And I was passed a pile of ashes with some pieces of gold paper, gold leaf from something, and some burnt, singed pages of I mean's guidance, which is what you wanted me to read here.

38:55.000 --> 39:24.000
The dawn is at hand into new and uncharted waters, griffith and proofing, rough and smooth. Listen and hear my voice, a new heaven and a new earth.

39:25.000 --> 39:50.000
Can I just read that out? Again, the part one glimpses of Eileen Cadw's life, part two, the inner voice. The dawn is at hand into new and uncharted waters, through thick and thin, through rough and smooth. Listen and hear my voice.

39:50.000 --> 40:06.000
On, literally, you can witness it, charred paper. It is charred paper. It is charred paper. There you are. That's what's come out of the ashes. That's what speaks.

40:06.000 --> 40:35.000
Terry Gilby, again, the other night. I don't know Terry. I only know what I saw of him on the other night. I don't know if he's here tonight or not, but he brought back to him on this to put him again. How does this foundation serve the world today and into the future? How does this foundation, how does this community,

40:35.000 --> 40:54.000
serve the world today and into the future? Because if you can identify what you can serve, what you are called to serve, then the way the truth and the life will open to you.

40:54.000 --> 41:23.000
And that's the deeper level of the ddama created, the field of the ddama, on which the battlefield of life and what came to pass, Sanjaya, takes place. Who was Sanjaya? Sanjaya was the equal-eyed charioteer of the blind king's leadership, because political power or bureaucratic power is always blind.

41:25.000 --> 41:42.000
Those who have to administer a place like this have to focus their energies on balancing the books and the marketing and getting people in and all the rest of it. They may not have the same opportunity to connect in so much with that deeper spiritual order.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
But it's so important to understand in the organisation and ecology how that balance is.

41:48.000 --> 42:09.000
There were various calls for more democracy, more participation in this fellows' Zoom, and people expressing frustration at not just in Fenton, but elsewhere, Orwell, etc., struggling to find ways forward by which that was possible.

42:10.000 --> 42:29.000
The age-old question of how do you balance the need for certain types of professional knowledge and responsibility with everybody feeling a part of what is going on, even if they don't agree with it, recognising that it is due process that is taking place.

42:30.000 --> 42:47.000
In that respect, I brought with me a book. I always keep a spare copy of this, and my spare copy that I'd given away the last one arrived just before coming here, and it came into me to bring this here and to leave this with you.

42:47.000 --> 43:12.000
A book called Beyond Majority Rule brought us decisions in the religious society of friends in the Quakers. This is about Quaker discernment process, where when it is properly held at a gathered meeting, a meeting gathered in nothing less than the Holy Spirit,

43:12.000 --> 43:30.000
what is discussed and the decisions made is not about the me, it's not even about the we as different groups in a collective, but it is about discerning the movement of the spirit in that.

43:30.000 --> 43:53.000
We discussed it last night, and folk were saying it works better with small groups and large ones, and yet when the Quakers had to decide over whether to acknowledge gay marriage, 600 people with many different views, some strongly against, gathered together and found unity around accepting it.

43:53.000 --> 44:06.000
Even though some disagreed, they felt that the sense of the meeting, not that expression, the sense of the meeting was in that direction, and they respected that people thought it.

44:06.000 --> 44:24.000
So there you are, Rebecca. I'm going to give you this for it to be used in whatever way might serve the foundation if it does. I've also got some pages again that I can send to you that you might want to circulate so that people know the kind of material that's in that book.

44:25.000 --> 44:43.000
I want to move on now with another 10 minutes. I want to take this a bit deeper. I want to take this process of what disarmament is a bit deeper, but it's an uncomfortable place.

44:43.000 --> 45:02.000
Although I'm very much on the periphery of your community, just coming here for the guest occasion, and I would be wary of having myself described as new age, especially in some of the kind of circles that I move in.

45:02.000 --> 45:17.000
Although in that original sense, William Bloom describes a keyless quote, very much a part of that. Although all of that.

45:17.000 --> 45:46.000
When Rebecca asked Anna if I might be freed for this evening to give us sharing, I was quite apprehensive about it, not just because of the sensitivities, but also wondering whether I could really say what perhaps needed to be said.

45:47.000 --> 46:02.000
And for the two nights before coming here, I thought, okay, you know, there's the angel of Finthorn, or to put it in my own language, the inner constellation of spiritual forces that hold us together.

46:03.000 --> 46:15.000
Let me ask the angel of Finthorn to send me a dream for what I need to share with you. And two nights ago, three nights ago now, no dream.

46:16.000 --> 46:33.000
And then the night before last, I was preparing to hit up here. I wake up at 4.30 in the morning and I said, my goodness, I need to get some thoughts down about this before I go.

46:33.000 --> 46:43.000
And I worked at my computer, drafting stuff, checking references and books until 7 when I started to get really tired again.

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
I thought, I'll just go back and have an hour. And I woke up at half nine, two and a half hours.

46:50.000 --> 47:02.000
And then I realized I'd been having a dream. And the dream was this. It's not a comfortable dream. It was very interesting.

47:02.000 --> 47:13.000
I was coming back on the ferry from the island of Lewis with a group of six people, some of them indigenous to the island, others to the tourism.

47:13.000 --> 47:21.000
And we're having a merry old time. And the ship was going to make an unscheduled early stop at which we were going to get off.

47:21.000 --> 47:29.000
And knowing that, Rebecca and Roy always rescue me from Finthorn veganism when I come here by making a fish...

47:29.000 --> 47:36.000
I probably shouldn't have compressed to the fish pie, but if they looked at my phone, they'd see the scales of Mackle.

47:37.000 --> 47:44.000
I have to confess what I am and where I'm from and how I am and so on.

47:44.000 --> 47:50.000
So fish pie was in my mind. And in the dream, I ordered the fish and chips for everybody before we got off the boat.

47:50.000 --> 47:56.000
So we're all getting off the boat without fish suppers to get into the minibus of dinner.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
And I noticed a device left on our table. I said, oh, that must be one of our people.

48:01.000 --> 48:07.000
So I'm heading off and I'm about to go down the gang flank, but suddenly thought comes, maybe it's not one of theirs.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
Maybe it belongs to one of the crew. So I go back and there's a steward, an island guy, a guy I know.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
I said to him, this isn't yours by any chance. He said, oh yes, that's mine.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
I said, what is it? And he switched it on and messages started flowing down.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
He said, that's how I communicate with the captain.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
So this is about communicating with that sense of higher power.

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
The dream then cut to the show and there was my former student Ian McKinnon,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
a tradition bearer from the Isle of Skye, who's we've been referring to today.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
And he was tending a flower bed, a raised flower bed,

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
or the probonad.

48:58.000 --> 49:05.000
And he was planting it out beautifully with all kinds of flowers and shrubs that were indigenous to the place.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
And he completed his work and walked off down to the seashore.

49:11.000 --> 49:18.000
But then somebody came along with a kind of agitated energy

49:18.000 --> 49:26.000
who was obviously a stranger to the place and started pulling out the shrubs and plants,

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
intending to replant them with stuff that did not belong in the place, that was not indigenous to the place.

49:32.000 --> 49:39.000
And I said, hey, stop. Ian's planted it like Ian has planted it like that for a reason.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
And the man wandered off and I replanted Ian's flowers.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
This is about becoming indigenous to place.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
The way I have always seen Findhorn, notwithstanding what I confess,

49:57.000 --> 50:02.000
many of us in Scotland sometimes speak of as its wackiness,

50:03.000 --> 50:09.000
notwithstanding the wacky elements of Findhorn, the way I have always seen it,

50:09.000 --> 50:16.000
is it coming from California, from Germany, from Australia, from wherever it is you're coming from.

50:16.000 --> 50:23.000
Many of you are of the diaspora that left this country in the time of the enclosures in England

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
or the clearances in Scotland, and you're coming back bearing gifts.

50:28.000 --> 50:34.000
Hence the importance of, say, the work you've done in eco-architecture, in energy and so on.

50:34.000 --> 50:42.000
No, it was wonderful to see Findhorn featured on the front cover of one of the IPCC's most recent scientific books.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
That's a real accolade of what you've achieved there.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
And yet I would suggest that there is a need now for the new age, whatever you want to call it,

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
to be grounded in place, to re-indigenise, to be.

50:59.000 --> 51:07.000
Indigenous does not necessarily mean to be native, but it means to come to belong to a place.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
Finally, we went down to the shore, where to cut the story short.

51:13.000 --> 51:20.000
A stranger came and took my fishing line from me, cast it out, and pulled in two big black fish,

51:20.000 --> 51:25.000
which I knew we had to eat, and yet I felt queasy about it.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
It's a recurrent tree in my house, I call it my jellyfish.

51:29.000 --> 51:38.000
It represents both my shadow in the Jungian sense, and the shadow of situations that I am in these days.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
That part of the dream said, we have to process our shadow.

51:43.000 --> 51:51.000
We have to catch our shadow, we have to consume our shadow, we have to integrate it in.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
So you had the sense on the boat of being in touch.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
I would suggest that there is divine energy.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
You had the sense of re-indigenisation with Ian's planting out,

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
but also being aware that not everybody understands that process and its importance,

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
and you had the sense of integrating the shadow.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
Finally, Jung's favourite story was a rainmaker.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
I'm sure many of you who look here know it.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
I use it frequently.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
It was told to him by the German translator and missionary Richard Bielholm,

52:29.000 --> 52:37.000
who was a missionary in China in the 1920s, or before that, before the First World War,

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
and into the start of the First World War.

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
While he was there, there was a terrible drought in the process.

52:47.000 --> 52:53.000
The plants started to die, the animals started to die, the people knew that they would be next.

52:53.000 --> 53:01.000
In their desperation, they went to the Protestant missionaries and asked for prayers.

53:01.000 --> 53:10.000
The Protestant missionaries came and made their prayers and interminably long sermons.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
Then they went to the Catholics, and the Catholics came and sprinkled holy water

53:15.000 --> 53:22.000
and possessed round with statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and whatever they would be doing.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I'm still no rain.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
Then they went to their own indigenous Taoist and Confucian shamans,

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
and they came and set off fireworks and fired guns into the air to frighten off the evil spirits

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
that had caused the drought, but still no rain.

53:38.000 --> 53:44.000
Finally, Bielholm told you, are the last resort interesting, the last resort.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Why is the last resort?

53:46.000 --> 53:54.000
Because if they would reflect most fully on themselves, they would have to eat that jelly fish.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
They called him the Rainmaker.

53:57.000 --> 54:04.000
The Rainmaker was a wizened little old man who came from a neighbouring province.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
When he arrived, they asked him what he needed.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
He said, I just need a hut to go and sit in.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
He went and sat in the hut for three days and three nights,

54:14.000 --> 54:21.000
so after there was an unseasonable heavy fall of snow which melted to yield rain,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
and the drought was relieved.

54:25.000 --> 54:32.000
The Chinese picked to go back to business, but Bielholm, being not just a professor,

54:32.000 --> 54:43.000
not just any old professor, but a German professor, wanted to know what had happened.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
One of those wonderful missionaries who had never made any converse,

54:47.000 --> 54:54.000
translated the I Ching in the version many of you will know as Well of the Doubt I Ching,

54:54.000 --> 55:01.000
which is also a wonderful version in its talk of the man of calling, or the person of calling,

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
the person who beats the doubt.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
And the Rainmaker said, I did nothing, I just sat in the hut.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Oh, come on, says Bielholm, you must have done something.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Was it magic spells, incantations?

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
No, no magic spells, no incantations.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
Well, what was it, said Bielholm, getting persuaded.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
I'll tell you what it was, said the Rainmaker, when I came here.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
When I left my province, my spirit was in the doubt, in the drama,

55:28.000 --> 55:37.000
in the way, the truth, in the life, in the Buddha nature, with a laugh.

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
But when I got here, I found my spirit was no longer in the doubt.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
So I went and sat in the hut, and after three days and three nights,

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
my spirit came back into the doubt, and that's when the rain came.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
Friends, I leave it with you, the indigenous people of this land,

55:58.000 --> 56:10.000
and I watch for you here, like Ian McKinnon, like Mary Campbell, comes here.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
They have set out a flower bed for you.

56:13.000 --> 56:19.000
You have also brought your own plants, some of which harmonise very beautifully in.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
You have brought gifts back from the diaspora.

56:23.000 --> 56:34.000
The task before you now, after the fire, is to be in the doubt so that the rain comes,

56:34.000 --> 56:41.000
and the drought is relieved, so that God is no longer alone.

56:41.000 --> 56:49.000
You are no longer alone, but you are together in a position where, as a community,

56:49.000 --> 57:01.000
you can discern decisions under the guidance of that spirit, which is holy,

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
and become conscious of the openings of the way that this beautiful place

57:07.000 --> 57:14.000
might continue to serve for the world today and in the future.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Thank you.

57:16.000 --> 57:29.000
APPLAUSE

57:29.000 --> 57:38.000
Can I have this set up in the box, which you are on this?

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
So, in a moment, if you are wanting to make a comment or ask a question,

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
there will be somebody bringing Mike Rounding back to you.

57:48.000 --> 57:57.000
So, you might be as if you'd like to respond or ask a question please later on.

57:57.000 --> 58:03.000
Chris, it's okay. There's one hardwired into the system up there, so I'm hearing things.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
Chris, it's okay for you.

58:07.000 --> 58:14.000
Thank you. Thank you.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
Tis, thank you very much Alistair.

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
I found that very moving and very profound for us as a community.

58:21.000 --> 58:36.000
My question to you really is, I heard you talk about grounding and becoming native to place.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
Sorry, becoming indigenous to place, and I have my understanding of that,

58:42.000 --> 58:48.000
but I'd really love to hear more about what you feel that really means for us.

58:48.000 --> 58:56.000
Thank you for that question and just what we will, what we spent today discussing.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
For the last 19 years I've lived in Governan, Glasgow,

59:02.000 --> 59:08.000
to the Hartfest, a former shipbuilding area of Glasgow.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
Sorry, just having published my sign there.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
We were invited by people from that area and from Pollock,

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
who had been involved in 1990s motorway protests.

59:21.000 --> 59:27.000
The M77 Pollock Free State campaign had the beautiful BBC documentary

59:27.000 --> 59:34.000
called The Birdman of Pollock on YouTube about it.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
When the motorway protest came to an end in the mid 1990s, Colin McLeod, the founder, said,

59:39.000 --> 59:46.000
okay, we've shown them what we're against, now let's show them what we're for.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
Let's take the defeat of the motorway being driven through Pollock Park,

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
but turn it into something beautiful.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
He showed me a Scottish history book that used the term Gal Gale,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
to speak of the people of the outer Hebrides, known as Finnish Gal,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
or Galloway, or Galway in Ireland,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
meaning the people who are strangers, strange or foreign gales.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
These are the people where the Norse have come down

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and mixed their blood with the garlic blood, so you had a hybrid people.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
He said, well, that's how it is for so many people in Glasgow today.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
None of us are pure this or that in terms of ethnic identity,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
in terms of native identity.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
There's a bit of this and a bit of that.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
My mother's English, my father's Scottish,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
my Scottish father has roots in the border

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and roots some of them around here and so on.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
We are all Gal Gales now.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:57.000
That sense of coming to belong is what it's about.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It's expressed in our poetry, Robert Byrne,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
a man to man for all that, for all that, and all that.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It's coming yet for all that, that man to man,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
the world around, our brother's people, all that.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Amy Tenderson and the alternative Scottish national anthem,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
the freedom to come all ye, black and white in,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
we either marry it, black and white will marry each other.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's in our proverbs, Alexander Carmichael cites one,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
the bonds of blood are worth 30 fold,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
the bonds of milk in other words nurture 100 fold,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
because in the Celtic tradition there are two sacred duties,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
hospitality for the short term

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
and postorship or adoption for the long term.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I have one of my poems in Love and Revolution

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
called Scotland, they showed a person belongs

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
in as much as he a willing, in as much as he a willing

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:08.000
to cherish and be cherished by this place and its people.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
This is about the heart.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
This is not about, I didn't call my best known book,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Love and Soil.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I called it Soil and Soul,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
to which Satish Kumar said to me, we could add another one

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and make it Soil, Soul and Society,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
which is one of his recent books.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
How do you do that in practice?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
You first of all do it by welcoming in the stranger

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
on a basis of hospitality.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And then I would be quite blunt and say,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
you show the stranger what it means to be a good guest,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
because it doesn't work if the guests take over the guest house.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It doesn't work if the guests take over the guest house.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
There needs to be a mutual respect

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
until the community can grow as a result of new ideas

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and new blood coming in.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
That becomes its strength, but also it holds cohesion.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
What is its cohesion?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Its cohesion is ultimately the God-given dynamic

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
of what it means to be a community or place

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
in that particular bio-region.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
How do you do that in practice and Gal Gael

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
if you come and visit us as a community meal every Thursday night?

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
We do it by sharing food, music, poetry, song, story.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
We do it by having a workshop where people build boats

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and they get out rowing boats and so on.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
People like Madge come and visit us and educate us with songs.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That's how we do it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Much as you do it here in this universal home,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
that's why it's such a privilege.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Next person, just put your hand up

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and the microphone will go to you.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Robbie Burns

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:27.000
talked about being in the world without a friend

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000
was an expression that Robbie Burns used to describe that sense of alienation

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
in the world that was being created,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
maybe partly because it was a very alienating cosmology

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
that was being brought into the world at that time.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I wondered whether you had any thoughts about the new cosmology

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
that might be emerging to bring it all together.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Obviously you've been talking about it.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I feel implicitly tonight,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
but the word cosmology comes to my mind as a sort of framework to live by.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I wonder if you have any comments on that.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I'm just pulling up the point.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
My hearing is being fixed,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
and I'm missing about my phone settings.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
This is Robbie Burns' poem of Youngstras Elan

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
after the Highland troops had been defeated at Caloddon.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It's not that far from here.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
This is Dros Elan, the young chief's meditation.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Pick of snipes around my dwelling.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Howling tempers soar me row.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Turbid torrents, wintree's welling,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
roving by my lonely cave.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Crystal streamlets gently flowing.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Busy hawns of baseman kind.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Western breezes softly blowing.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Suit not my destructive mind.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
He's no longer able to connect with nature.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It suits not his destructive mind

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
because of the calamity that's come upon them.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
In the cause of right engage.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Engaged.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Wrongs injurious to address.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Honest war was strongly waged,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
but the heavens denied success.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Ruins wheel has written the words.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Not a hope that they've attained.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The wide world is all before us,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
but a world without a friend.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So, in the Galgail Trust, many of our people

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
have multiple issues, homelessness,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
addictions, mental health issues,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
in and out of prison.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Multiple dynamics by which poverty

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
plays itself out.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And deepest of all in that is

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
profound loneliness.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I'm not sure if you can see

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and deepest of all in that is

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
profound loneliness.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
That book is called alone with the alone.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
To be alone with the divine,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
but when you are alone with the divine,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
you are with cosmic presence.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
If you haven't had an opportunity to connect with that,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
if you've perhaps been subjected to spiritual abuse,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
like cultic forms of religion,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
or hardline, health-out-reven forms of religion,

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
you get cut off from that.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And so, in Writers and the Storm,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
my most recent open climate change,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I end up talking about the Four Seas,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
as clearance when people were disconnected

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
from their indiginality by being cleared from the land,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and today kept off the land,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
unless you've got money, it's very hard

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
to be able to afford to live in rural areas.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Clearance collapse,

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
the psychological collapse

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
that brings about, the spiritual collapse,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
like you've just heard in that poem,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
that even the beauties of nature

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
no longer suit whose distracted mind,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
the wide world is all before me,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
the world of empires is all before me,

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
but a world without a friend.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And the third seed, consumption,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
when we can't get no satisfaction

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
in the world,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
because we're cut off from our ability

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
to find authentic satisfaction,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
we look for satisfaction,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
not by true satisfies,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
but by false satisfies,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
and that drives consumerism,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
which drives climate change,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
and then the Four Seas,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
the antidote to it, community.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I consider the single most important work

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
that any of us can do in the face of climate change,

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
in the face of poverty,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
in the face of war and other such related matters,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
is to hold for Takapama,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the American Quake,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
it calls spaces for spitable to the soul.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It's not my business to tell you

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
what you should be doing at Fenton,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
but if it was,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
if I was one of you,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
my difference was

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
what I've been discerning over these last few days

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
as I've prepared for this talk

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
would be to suggest that the most fundamental thing here

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
is that you hold spaces

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
that are hospitable to the soul,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
where pilgrims can come from afar,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
who need physical presence,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
who need a place to stay and rest,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
affordably,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
who need the hospitality,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
at least for the short term,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
if not the hostorship for the long term,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
who need the music, song, story,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
the love that you can offer here.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I walk through this space,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I see a lot of love manifested in it,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
the way your houses are,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
the way people interact,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
the way the gardens are and so on.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
When I was in Papua New Guinea,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
where I learned so much

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
of these things of a young man,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I was there for four years,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Sir Bernard Naracobi,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
who was then the Minister for Justice,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
and with a trustee of the organisation

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I worked for,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
the South Pacific Appropriate Technology Foundation,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
had a poem that I often used,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I used it for the group today.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And the black-skinned area of the Pacific

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
is called Melanesia,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I was just thinking from Micronesia,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
so we'll talk about Melanesian people.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Welcome to the University of Melanesia,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
the ancient, timeless, eternal

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
University of Melanesia,

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
the village where courses are offered in living.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Welcome to the University of Scotland,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
the ancient, timeless, eternal University of Scotland,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
the village where courses are offered in living.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
You know, if you fork in the future,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
if you look towards the future,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
if you can simply create simple structures,

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I would say she has radical simplicity,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
radical simplicity,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
by which and through which,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
in ways formal and informal,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
you can offer courses in living.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Then that new age,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
then that new age turns another leaf

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and finds another breath of life.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Thank you for that question.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
How's our time, Rebecca?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Another 15, excellent.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So, there's a hand up at the back there.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Thank you for...

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Chris, when you were a student,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I never knew you could be as useful as this.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Thank you very much.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I mean, I wish we could turn back...

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I wish we could turn back the clock and...

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Please, my friend, yes.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Hang on, wait a minute.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I'd like to just turn you back on here.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Wrong one.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I'll speak to these.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I'm wondering if you could speak to

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
processes that support

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
looking at the shadow in community.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
So, processes, yes.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Just your thoughts.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Thank you.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Well...

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I need to fiddle with my back

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
in this other way.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I defend myself as my own voice coming

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
with a slight delay.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Did you notice how I'm telling you about

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
the third part of that dream?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Let me unpack it a bit more

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
of what happened in that dream,

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
because I was shorting it each time.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So, I went down to the pier

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and recently I've been taking young families

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
out canoe fishing

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
in what I call my dugouts,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
or wherever in my dugouts.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
We've got two inflatable canoes.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Wonderful things.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I've been taking them out fishing

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
in the Firth of Clyde

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
and in the Firth of Forth of Kinghorn,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
while the mackerel have been in.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Substantially, to help them ground in place.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
The other day, family, she's German,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
she's Chilean,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
hoping them to ground in place.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
So, fish has been on my mind a lot, just now.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
It's not surprising that fish came so strongly in the dream.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But what happened in the third part?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
After me-planting Ian's flowerbed,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I wandered down to the pier,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
and I'm thinking, because the mackerel are in,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I'll probably catch them off the pier.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I've got my hand lying with me

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
and I go down

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and I take the lead weight with the two mackerel feathers on it.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I only use two when I'm in the canoe,

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
so I don't puncture it too often.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
It's not too great when you're out half a mile off shore

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
and you've got an inflatable canoe.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I have to bring out a little hand pump, of course.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
The other day it happened,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I've got a puncture, so it would be kind of

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
pump-worn, catch-worn, pump-worn, catch-worn,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and that way we kept it satisfactory.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
So I threw out the hand line on the pier.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
And I felt a heavy weight on the end,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
and I pulled it in, and I thought,

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
this feels like an unusual fish.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And up came this very beautiful,

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
but frightening fish.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And it was a long fish,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
and it was covered in colourful

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
spines like a sea urchin.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Now, remember your question,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
which is about process,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
for dealing with the shadow.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It was covered in colourful spines like a sea urchin.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I half knew its name,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
of course, because it's of another manifestation of

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
your spacefully the jellyfish,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
which comes to me in different forms

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
and dreams at different times.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
So, on this occasion, it's colourful, but scary fish,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
and it will foul hook it through the back.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
So I thought, I'm going to take the hook out

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
and I'm going to throw it back into the sea.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
It's probably edible, but something in me

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
felt icky about...

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I mean, that's always a sign about your stuff.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And it's about interaction of shadows.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So I did this, but while I was

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
sewing this fish back,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
another stranger came,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and he had a rather rakish appearance,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
rather casual appearance,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and without asking, he took my fishing line

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
and he threw it in

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and pulled in these fish,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
which are these two big black

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
saith of cold fish

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000
that I mentioned.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
And then I woke up

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and I realised that

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
all three of those fish

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
had been manifestations of the shadow.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
The first one was all prickly.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It was beautiful, but it was prickly.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
If you're going to have the beauty,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
you have to accept that the prickliness

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
is going to come with it.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And the second one,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I knew we had to eat it.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I showed the man who had taken my line,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I showed him how to kill it,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
how to kill both of them,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
because we were going to take them back

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
and we were going to eat them.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Now, why have I told you about that dream?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Because where are you?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Yes, thank you.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Why have I told you about that dream?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Part of the reason why

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
am I moving out to the site of the zoom here?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Part of the reason why

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
is to model being able to talk about our shadows

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and how we interact with the shadows.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So how do you do it?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
You talk about your jellyfishies

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
or whatever it is.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And so you set what in Quakerism

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
we call patterns and examples

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
of ways of doing things.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
A pattern,

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
a way of doing things.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
An example, a case study,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
like I've just given to you.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
You create a climate

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
in which it can be comfortable

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
to talk about these things.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Now, one of the things that that achieves,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
if it is well held,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
if the space is well held,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
and by well held,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I mean being held in that place

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
of prayer or contemplation,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
being held in that God space.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
If it is well held,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
if the facilitator

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
or others in the group

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
keeps calling people back

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
to the God given intention

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
that they are there for,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
then you will be able to do it

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
in a way that processes it.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Colin McLeod, the co-founder

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
of the Gal Gale, used to put it,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
shit happens,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
what matters is how you shovel it.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And in my view, with land reform,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
the single most important thing

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
that communities need to learn

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
is how to shovel shit.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Because when you shovel shit,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
as you well know, you may compost.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
But if you don't shovel the shit,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
the shit just stinks,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
causes illness.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
So I would suggest these are the kind of ways

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
you talk about it.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
But what is so often missing,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
including in right-on communities,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
including in Christian groups and so on,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
what is so often missing

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
is holding it in that divine fire,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and calling it back to that God's peace,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
as I call it.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I think this is why a lot of process-related stuff

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
goes wrong.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Because people are trying to do it

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
at the level of the head and the heart and the hand.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
But they're forgetting,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
they're forgetting the device,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
that the chief steward

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
on the log C-force had,

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
by which he communicated to the captain.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I know that's a hierarchical model of the divine,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
and you all know it doesn't work like that.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
The divine emerges from within.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
But we're talking about how dreams use symbolism.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
So that will be probably as much as I could suggest

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
to you just now.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Keep holding it in the fire.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
If you don't hold it in the fire of God,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
the fire of people's shadow

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
will burn those around them.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
If you hold it in the fire of God,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
you will help others together, collectively,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
to process, to recognise the shadow,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
and to process it.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Conflict is normal in healthy communities,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
but it must be recognised and processed.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Judith, he was very good at doing that.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Judith is really impressive

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
from what I've seen of her work.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
It was a joy being his mind.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
No, I just wanted to share.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I have such a powerful memory

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
of Dorothy and Irene,

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
sitting in a Monday evening,

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
sharing with us the shadow of their legacies.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
sharing with us the shadow of their legacies.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Irene said it was the self-sacrifice

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
that went as far as martyrdom,

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
and Dorothy said it was not standing up

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
for herself with Peter.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000

You'll find it all cataloged in my book, Po spaghetti.

Which expose all of this. A difficult discussion about what you feed the fairies on.

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:18.800
And no it's not bread and butter. You feed the fairies on venison and honey.

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.660
I've lost my track as to why I got there.

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.340
Yeah, yeah, basically.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.500
But basically I caught one of the elders in the group before I left and said,

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:33.140
you know, could you just check in with that person?

01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:37.740
Because I think that had I had more time, she would have wanted to have it out

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.580
with me and there's not been that opportunity.

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:46.540
So could you just could you let her know that I picked up the vibe from her?

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:51.220
It was not the place for me to justify the kind of person I am.

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.300
Oh, yeah, I know where I was getting to.

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.460
But the other thing is the other thing

01:24:55.660 --> 01:25:00.780
to this is that I get people say to me and you will well understand why if you're

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:04.220
a vegetarian or vegan, which many of you probably are, say,

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:07.780
Alistair, how can you still eat meat?

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.300
How can you still go fishing?

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:15.580
To which my answer is folks, I just do.

01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:21.180
And if I try to suppress that in myself, it's it's not going to work.

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.420
But notice how I acknowledge it.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.700
I acknowledge that aspect of what some of you might see and which that young

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.260
woman today probably saw as being my shadow.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:35.660
We can one of the ways we can help open this ground

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:44.140
is by acknowledging aspects of ourselves that we know others might have difficulty.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:50.140
Then feel a sense of relief being slight.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:56.780
Any more one up there?

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:58.780
Oh, somebody's got the bike already.

01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:59.980
Yeah, hang on.

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:00.980
Wait, let's switch.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.180
Oh, yeah.

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.980
Alistair, we've just got two minutes.

01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:08.700
Is it two minutes?

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.180
Yep, I think we should don't have time to.

01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.980
Well, it takes us to the last one and.

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.140
OK, that's come out of Alistair.

01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:24.980
Annwyr a hamelag ancien a hamelaigio.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.060
I don't speak the garlic.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:33.300
I know enough to understand your greeting that part of my own shadow is that in

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:37.420
spite of being raised in.

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:44.700
Norslox and Lewis, not only don't I speak the garlic, but I have the greatest

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.020
difficulty in remembering even basic phrases.

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.420
And I think that's a psychological issue in me.

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:56.060
And I've spoken to other people of my generation, some of whom have the same

01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:59.940
problem too, and mostly we don't talk about it because it is embarrassing.

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:00.980
But you know what?

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.140
Whenever you hit on something that is embarrassing,

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:06.580
it's only the ego that's being offended.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:11.220
It's nothing that the fire of hell can't burn off because the fire of love is

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:13.940
that which only burns off, which isn't authentic.

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:18.380
So I have to acknowledge to you in front of everybody here that I do not

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:23.620
actually understand the garlic you have just spoken to me beyond your initial

01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:25.660
good evening greeting.

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.940
And me neither.

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.660
Alistair.

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:35.340
But I know that I don't understand it, but I do speak it a little.

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:39.180
So when I am weak, I am strong.

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.780
No.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.180
When I am weak, then I am strong.

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:45.860
But there we go.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.500
Spence, spence of weakness.

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:52.860
So the rain maker had no extraordinary power.

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:57.420
And yet somehow he constantly did the rain around him.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.620
Adrian Rich, the American poet,

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.540
with Jewish and Scottish Presbyterian roots.

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:07.260
My heart is moved by all I cannot change.

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.020
So much has been destroyed.

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:13.100
I have to cast my lot with those who age after age,

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:20.060
purposely with no extra ordinary power we constitute today.

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:25.180
Your future will be built up from no extra ordinary power.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:28.300
And I'd like to just close, if I may,

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:32.780
by reading a part of the poem from R.S. Thomas.

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:38.060
I should say that to use my embarrassment with language.

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:42.060
I've got the phonetic spelling printed out here.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.580
Because it's pronounced double L, E, Y, N.

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.500
How the heck keeps it on set?

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.380
Even though my grandmother was of Welsh

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:56.620
rooting, the poem is called The Moon in Slain.

01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:00.460
And if there's any Welsh people here,

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.940
please don't shout out the correct pronunciation,

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:05.740
because my hearing aids are not tuned to you just now.

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:08.940
The Moon in Slain.

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:16.700
The last part of the Moon of Jesus gives way to the dark.

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:20.140
The serpent digests the egg.

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:23.740
Here on my knees in this stone church,

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:28.860
that is full only of the silent congregation of shepherds.

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:33.380
The silent congregation of shadows and the sea sound.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:36.540
It is easy to believe Yates was right.

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:42.300
Just as old choirs had not sung, shells have swallowed them.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.660
The pied laps of the Bible, the bell

01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:49.180
fetches no people to the brittle miracle of the bread.

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:56.460
The sand is waiting for the running back of the grains in the wall into its blonde glass.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:58.380
Religion is over.

01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:01.340
Religion is over.

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:05.580
And what will emerge from the body of the new moon?
