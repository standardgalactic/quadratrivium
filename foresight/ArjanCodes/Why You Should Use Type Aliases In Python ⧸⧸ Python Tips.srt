00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Here we have a trading bot that has a buy strategy and a sell strategy.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,500
Each of these are functions, so they use the callable type.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
And there are some examples of these functions right here below.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,100
Don't use these for actual trading.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,900
By the way, it's just an example.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,600
And then in the main function, we create a trading bot and we pass a specific buy and sell strategy.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,700
Now, instead of defining these types here in line, you can also use a type alias.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,900
And that makes it a bit easier to understand.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,300
So for example, here we could create a trading strategy function

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,700
and give that the type callable that we have right here.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:45,300
And now instead of using the type directly, we can change this to use a trading strategy function instead.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,600
And same here.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,300
This makes it a bit easier to understand.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,400
And if we ever decide we don't want to use integers anymore to represent prices,

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,800
you can change the type here and you don't have to change the types all over the place in your code.
