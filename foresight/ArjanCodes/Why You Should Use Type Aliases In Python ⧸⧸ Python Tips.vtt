00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Here we have a trading bot that has a buy strategy and a sell strategy.

00:04.200 --> 00:07.500
Each of these are functions, so they use the callable type.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.500
And there are some examples of these functions right here below.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.100
Don't use these for actual trading.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.900
By the way, it's just an example.

00:13.900 --> 00:19.600
And then in the main function, we create a trading bot and we pass a specific buy and sell strategy.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.700
Now, instead of defining these types here in line, you can also use a type alias.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.900
And that makes it a bit easier to understand.

00:26.900 --> 00:33.300
So for example, here we could create a trading strategy function

00:33.300 --> 00:37.700
and give that the type callable that we have right here.

00:37.700 --> 00:45.300
And now instead of using the type directly, we can change this to use a trading strategy function instead.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.600
And same here.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.300
This makes it a bit easier to understand.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.400
And if we ever decide we don't want to use integers anymore to represent prices,

00:53.400 --> 00:57.800
you can change the type here and you don't have to change the types all over the place in your code.
