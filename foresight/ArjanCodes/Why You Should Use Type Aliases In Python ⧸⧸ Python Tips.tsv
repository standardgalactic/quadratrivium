0	4200	Here we have a trading bot that has a buy strategy and a sell strategy.
4200	7500	Each of these are functions, so they use the callable type.
7500	10500	And there are some examples of these functions right here below.
10500	12100	Don't use these for actual trading.
12100	13900	By the way, it's just an example.
13900	19600	And then in the main function, we create a trading bot and we pass a specific buy and sell strategy.
19600	24700	Now, instead of defining these types here in line, you can also use a type alias.
24700	26900	And that makes it a bit easier to understand.
26900	33300	So for example, here we could create a trading strategy function
33300	37700	and give that the type callable that we have right here.
37700	45300	And now instead of using the type directly, we can change this to use a trading strategy function instead.
45300	47600	And same here.
47600	49300	This makes it a bit easier to understand.
49300	53400	And if we ever decide we don't want to use integers anymore to represent prices,
53400	57800	you can change the type here and you don't have to change the types all over the place in your code.
