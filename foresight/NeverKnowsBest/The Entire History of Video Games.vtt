00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Video games have come a long way. From once being seen as a temporary fad, to

00:06.000 --> 00:11.760
just toys for children, or immoral corruptors of the youth, today the gaming

00:11.760 --> 00:16.800
industry easily surpasses the film and music industries combined and it's

00:16.800 --> 00:22.160
still growing. Still, as tempting as it might be to draw comparisons to more

00:22.160 --> 00:26.320
established industries, the reality is that video games have proved to be

00:26.320 --> 00:32.040
something unique. No other industry has been so closely tied to technological

00:32.040 --> 00:38.560
progress. No industry has ever grown so far so fast and no other industry has

00:38.560 --> 00:44.000
experienced so much change in such a short time. With multi-billion dollar

00:44.000 --> 00:48.520
companies rising and falling in the space for a few years and the entire gaming

00:48.520 --> 00:53.520
landscape being radically changed more than once by a couple guys working out

00:53.520 --> 01:01.040
of a garage. And all this in something that's only been around about 50 years.

01:01.040 --> 01:08.480
Video games have come a long way and their evolution has been remarkable. Today

01:08.480 --> 01:12.360
though, more and more people seem to be viewing the industry with pessimism and

01:12.360 --> 01:17.720
despite continued growth, its future doesn't look quite as bright as it once

01:17.720 --> 01:22.920
did, with companies and consumers alike increasingly seeming to be looking to the

01:22.920 --> 01:31.240
past. So, let's talk about the past. All of it, from the very first game right up

01:31.240 --> 01:38.120
to where we are today and every major event in between. This is the entire

01:38.120 --> 01:42.640
history of video games and it begins with something that would end up as a bit of a

01:42.640 --> 01:47.360
staple for the industry. War.

01:47.360 --> 01:58.000
World War II was kind of a big deal. In addition to deciding the fate of a

01:58.000 --> 02:02.520
global population and shaping the modern world as we know it, it also saw

02:02.520 --> 02:06.440
rapid technological advancement that would pave the way for something equally

02:06.440 --> 02:12.800
important. Video games. After building the first ever digital computers for the

02:12.800 --> 02:17.240
purpose of numerical processing and code-breaking as part of the war effort,

02:17.240 --> 02:21.360
this technology was subsequently commercialized and found its way to

02:21.360 --> 02:28.600
several universities. And where computers go, video games soon follow. Of course,

02:28.600 --> 02:33.320
they weren't exactly designed as video games so much as demonstrations to show

02:33.320 --> 02:37.520
what computers could do or just experiments to further the field of

02:37.520 --> 02:42.920
computer science. The first to be shown to the public was Bertie the Brain in

02:42.920 --> 02:50.560
1950, who played Tic Tac Toe. Poor Bertie was apparently quite good, although

02:50.560 --> 02:54.640
every photo seems to show him losing and he was dismantled two weeks after the

02:54.640 --> 03:00.720
exhibition, as tended to be the case with these early computers. The first game to

03:00.720 --> 03:07.200
be created as entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, a side-on simulation of

03:07.200 --> 03:11.920
a game of tennis that ran on an analog computer and was created by William

03:11.920 --> 03:16.320
Higginbotham, a man perhaps better known for his role in the creation of the

03:16.320 --> 03:24.600
atomic bomb. Meanwhile in 1962, Space War, a two player 1v1 space battle

03:24.600 --> 03:30.320
simulation created at MIT, became the first game to see wider distribution as

03:30.320 --> 03:36.400
its source code was shared between students and institutions. As the 60s

03:36.440 --> 03:40.640
continued, more games were created for the mainframe and mini computers of the

03:40.640 --> 03:45.600
era, but their popularity was quite limited by the fact that the computers

03:45.600 --> 03:50.760
needed to run these games cost thousands and thousands of dollars, something

03:50.760 --> 03:56.560
affordable for a university but less so for the average family. Things would

03:56.560 --> 04:01.080
change in the 1970s however as video games started to appear alongside

04:01.160 --> 04:08.120
Pimble Machines and other mechanical games in arcades. The first arcade video

04:08.120 --> 04:14.480
game was Computer Space in 1971 which took heavy inspiration from the earlier

04:14.480 --> 04:20.840
Space War and was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Damby. Computer Space

04:20.840 --> 04:25.200
saw limited success but its creators still believed in the potential of the

04:25.200 --> 04:32.680
medium so they founded their own company, Atari. At the same time as this, new

04:32.680 --> 04:38.360
breakthroughs were happening elsewhere as in 1972 the first ever home console was

04:38.360 --> 04:45.400
released by electronics company Magnavox. It was called the Odyssey and its

04:45.400 --> 04:50.480
development started six years earlier with the version finally released being

04:50.480 --> 04:55.480
the seventh successive prototype. The main challenge for team faced was

04:55.480 --> 05:01.400
affordability. The technology for a home console existed, it was just a question

05:01.400 --> 05:05.320
of how to keep the price low enough that anyone would be willing to manufacture

05:05.320 --> 05:12.520
or buy it. But eventually the team led by Ralph Bear found a way and so video

05:12.520 --> 05:18.640
games at long last came to the American family home. This was an important

05:18.640 --> 05:23.080
milestone although the Odyssey didn't exactly see the runaway success of later

05:23.080 --> 05:28.920
consoles. Still its simple two-player table tennis game did provide the

05:28.920 --> 05:34.400
inspiration for Atari's first game, a remarkably similar looking future

05:34.400 --> 05:42.520
phenomenon Pong. Released in arcades in late 1972 Pong was a game that changed

05:42.520 --> 05:48.920
gaming proving immensely popular in arcades and at 25 cent a game also

05:48.920 --> 05:57.160
immensely profitable. By the end of 72 we did three and a half million dollars and

05:57.160 --> 06:04.440
then we did 19 million then we did 35 million hockey stick. In fact Pong was

06:04.440 --> 06:10.120
so popular that the first machine installed quickly stopped working. Atari

06:10.120 --> 06:13.360
were called out to get it going again and found the problem was that the

06:13.360 --> 06:18.000
cash box had overflowed from the vast amount of quarters leading the machine

06:18.000 --> 06:25.920
to become jammed. And so arcades exploded in popularity as Pong proved gaming's

06:25.920 --> 06:32.600
potential. Video games had arrived and at the birth of this exciting new medium

06:32.600 --> 06:39.240
where the possibilities are endless how did everyone react you might wonder.

06:39.480 --> 06:46.920
Well obviously they copied the one thing everyone knew already worked. Atari

06:46.920 --> 06:52.280
made sequels and successors as well as their own dedicated home Pong console

06:52.280 --> 06:57.040
and other companies made their own versions alongside their own sequels

06:57.040 --> 07:04.000
and successors and dedicated home systems. Pong was everywhere as profit led

07:04.000 --> 07:10.960
to proliferation and before long video games were in decline. By the mid 1970s

07:10.960 --> 07:16.360
arcade growth slowed and then shrunk as the market became saturated with Pong

07:16.360 --> 07:20.080
clones and brand new companies that had once rushed to cash in on this big new

07:20.080 --> 07:25.760
thing started going under. Atari themselves fared better although they

07:25.760 --> 07:30.280
had their own troubles by way of a lawsuit that came from Magna Box over

07:30.280 --> 07:36.120
the striking similarities between Pong and their table tennis game. Atari

07:36.120 --> 07:40.760
settled but they weren't the only ones being sued and Magna Box's winnings

07:40.760 --> 07:46.840
ended up totaling over 100 million dollars. And so arcades were struggling

07:46.840 --> 07:52.040
but thanks to technological advancements over the 70s a new prize was up for

07:52.040 --> 07:57.240
grabs and the competition would be intense.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.440
Arcades might have been where video games got their start but home consoles

08:06.440 --> 08:13.200
offered an even greater opportunity and people were quick to realize it. In 1975

08:13.200 --> 08:17.440
the year Atari's home Pong released there were seven other companies

08:17.440 --> 08:24.640
releasing home video game consoles of their own. By 1977 there were at least

08:25.000 --> 08:31.880
82 other companies with 160 different models being released in that year alone.

08:31.880 --> 08:37.760
The consoles from this era were dedicated systems meaning they could only play

08:37.760 --> 08:43.200
one or more built-in games that came included. A lot of these were simply

08:43.200 --> 08:47.720
Pong clones with Atari even taking measures to make the cloning process

08:47.720 --> 08:53.760
more difficult to hinder their rivals. We actually became quite diabolical about

08:53.760 --> 08:59.920
seeing ways that we could just mess them up. We put a chip in and we purposefully

08:59.920 --> 09:06.400
mismarked it so that when somebody copied us they put the wrong chip in. This

09:06.400 --> 09:10.520
didn't stop the market from becoming saturated however but this time a

09:10.520 --> 09:16.400
solution would come through innovation and once more it would be Atari who led

09:16.400 --> 09:17.760
the way.

09:23.760 --> 09:30.760
The Atari video computer system is 20 cartridges with 1300 game variations you

09:30.760 --> 09:32.760
play on your own TV set.

09:36.760 --> 09:44.960
The Atari video computer system later called the Atari 2600 released in 1977.

09:44.960 --> 09:50.000
One year after the Fairchild Channel F became the first ever console to feature

09:50.000 --> 09:55.520
interchangeable cartridges. Bushnell saw the advantages cartridges provided and

09:55.520 --> 10:00.760
rushed to reduce a cartridge based system of his own but earlier problems with

10:00.760 --> 10:06.400
lawsuits, increasing competition and decline in arcade sales meant Atari's

10:06.400 --> 10:11.600
funds were getting low and so they made a deal with Warner Communications to sell

10:11.600 --> 10:17.200
Atari for $28 million. The consequences of this deal would be seen most clearly

10:17.200 --> 10:21.720
in the following years but for now it meant Atari had the money to finish

10:21.720 --> 10:26.400
their new console to beat out their main rival Magnavox who had released their

10:26.400 --> 10:35.560
own cartridge based system the Odyssey 2 in 1978. The Atari 2600 would be huge

10:35.560 --> 10:41.040
with lifetime sales of over 30 million units a number that dwarfs any other

10:41.040 --> 10:48.800
console of the era. Still this success came slowly and in late 1977 the entire

10:48.800 --> 10:56.560
gaming industry experienced its first but by no means last crash. The combination

10:56.560 --> 11:01.400
of a saturated market full of dedicated systems alongside new cartridge based

11:01.400 --> 11:06.440
systems that proved far more desirable meant heaps of dedicated systems

11:06.440 --> 11:10.720
suddenly stopped selling leaving retailers with a surplus of stock they

11:10.720 --> 11:14.280
couldn't shift and causing game developers to cancel most dedicated

11:14.280 --> 11:18.920
systems that were currently in development. The resulting downturn hit the

11:18.920 --> 11:23.840
gaming industry hard leading economists and media figures to speculate whether

11:23.840 --> 11:28.320
the entire gaming industry had simply been a short-lived craze that was now

11:28.320 --> 11:35.040
coming to the end of its life cycle. Amidst this pessimism the Atari 2600

11:35.040 --> 11:41.480
with its relatively high price point of $200 which is almost 1000 after

11:41.480 --> 11:47.080
adjusting for inflation was seen as a tough sell and retailers and consumers

11:47.080 --> 11:51.640
alike were hesitant to embrace it meaning Atari was only able to sell a

11:51.640 --> 11:57.320
fraction of the systems they manufactured in its first few years. Further

11:57.320 --> 12:01.680
competition would also come from other cartridge based systems including the

12:01.720 --> 12:08.400
Intellivision from Mattel and the ColecoVision from Coleco but Atari would

12:08.400 --> 12:12.600
soon find the killer app they needed that would not only get themselves back

12:12.600 --> 12:19.520
in business but would also get the entire gaming industry back on track.

12:23.640 --> 12:30.720
Space Invaders was created by Japanese developer Tomohiro Nishikado at Taito

12:30.760 --> 12:37.400
in 1978 and it is easily one of the most important and influential games ever made.

12:37.400 --> 12:43.280
Before Space Invaders different regions like America, Europe and Japan had

12:43.280 --> 12:48.000
little crossover between them but Space Invaders quickly moved beyond regional

12:48.000 --> 12:53.920
borders to become the first truly global gaming mega hit and that was by no

12:53.920 --> 13:00.400
means its only achievement. Its gameplay may look relatively simple today but

13:00.440 --> 13:05.600
in the 70s it was anything but. As a fixed shooter where the player takes on

13:05.600 --> 13:09.880
rows of gradually descending aliens while hiding behind fully destructible

13:09.880 --> 13:13.640
bunkers it was the first game to have enemies that shoot back at the player.

13:13.640 --> 13:19.720
It helped pioneer the move away from timers over to lives-based systems. It

13:19.720 --> 13:23.200
was the first game to feature a high score system giving it potentially

13:23.200 --> 13:27.320
infinite replayability and it was the first game to feature continuous

13:27.320 --> 13:32.560
background music. The background track itself was dynamic and increased in

13:32.560 --> 13:37.120
tempo in time with the enemies increased movement speed as rounds progressed

13:37.120 --> 13:43.400
giving the action a real sense of tension as the difficulty ramped up. This

13:43.400 --> 13:48.960
iconic part of the game wasn't actually intentional. During its development

13:48.960 --> 13:53.280
Nishikado found that the arcade processor struggled to handle so many

13:53.280 --> 13:58.240
enemies on screen at once and yet as the player took out more and more of them

13:58.240 --> 14:05.120
the render speed increased causing the aliens to move faster and faster. This

14:05.120 --> 14:09.560
created a difficulty curve where the challenge rose and fell within each level

14:09.560 --> 14:14.920
to create moments of higher and lower intensity a principle still seen in

14:14.920 --> 14:21.360
game design to this day. Space Invaders also featured some semblance of a story.

14:21.560 --> 14:30.520
Aliens were invading from space and you had to stop them. Okay it's not much but

14:30.520 --> 14:35.120
compared to the more abstract Pong or Breakout it made the action feel much

14:35.120 --> 14:39.160
more contextually meaningful and marked the beginning of arcade games paying

14:39.160 --> 14:45.840
more attention to these kinds of aspects. And if all that wasn't enough there

14:45.840 --> 14:53.280
was also the game's sales. By 1982 Space Invaders had grossed 3.8 billion

14:53.280 --> 14:59.760
dollars which is over 13 billion after inflation meaning it was the then best

14:59.760 --> 15:06.520
selling video game and highest grossing entertainment product of all time. For

15:06.520 --> 15:11.880
the industry this meant video games were back and soon it wasn't just Space

15:11.920 --> 15:17.840
Invaders. 1978 marked the beginning of what has since been named the golden age

15:17.840 --> 15:24.960
of the arcade. 1979 saw the release of Asteroids from Atari which continued the

15:24.960 --> 15:29.920
space battle theme this time in an asteroid field with more complex physics

15:29.920 --> 15:34.560
based movement while also using cutting-edge vector graphics that utilized

15:34.560 --> 15:40.080
lines instead of pixels to provide a crisp display unlike anything that could

15:40.080 --> 15:45.640
be produced on a home TV screen. The trend of popular arcade games where you

15:45.640 --> 15:51.320
shoot things continued in 1980 with Atari's 3D first-person tank sim

15:51.320 --> 15:56.920
battle zone as well as their trackball controlled missile command which took

15:56.920 --> 16:01.120
inspiration from the still ongoing Cold War to task players with defending

16:01.120 --> 16:07.760
cities from intercontinental ballistic missiles. 1981 gave the world defender

16:07.760 --> 16:11.920
from Williams Electronics which pioneered the side-scrolling shoot-em-up

16:11.920 --> 16:17.840
genre and Gallagher from Namco a fixed shooter which featured complex enemy

16:17.840 --> 16:24.080
patterns and power-ups both features that would define the genre moving forward.

16:24.080 --> 16:30.200
Shooters weren't the only thing coming out of arcades though. In 1980 Namco's

16:30.200 --> 16:37.560
Pac-Man gave the world its first gaming mascot Pac-Man well establishing the

16:37.560 --> 16:43.200
maze chased genre and being the first game to feature power-ups. As iconic as

16:43.200 --> 16:47.400
he would go on to become however Pac-Man's path to success wasn't a

16:47.400 --> 16:52.760
simple one. The game initially struggled to beat Namco's 1979 space shooter

16:52.760 --> 16:58.080
Galaxian in Japan while in America publisher Midway was hesitant to

16:58.080 --> 17:03.640
manufacture many units as they were unsure how it would perform. The reason for

17:03.640 --> 17:08.600
this was that it didn't involve any shooting and so executives feared it

17:08.600 --> 17:13.760
would be less popular with arcades mostly male player base. This was something

17:13.760 --> 17:18.800
developer Toru Iwatani had also considered as he deliberately tried to

17:18.800 --> 17:23.520
create a game that would appeal to women as well as men and offer something

17:23.520 --> 17:29.200
different to war or sports hence the colorful design cute characters and

17:29.240 --> 17:36.120
emphasis on eating rather than killing. Iwatani figured that girls like eating

17:36.120 --> 17:41.960
things more than killing them and it seems he was on to something because in

17:41.960 --> 17:47.160
the end players couldn't get enough of Pac-Man's addictive pellet eating action.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.480
Within a year it had become the best-selling arcade game in both Japan

17:51.480 --> 18:00.440
and America outgrossing even the 1977 film Star Wars in revenue. Pac-Man was

18:00.440 --> 18:05.200
one of the first but by no means last times a video game found record

18:05.200 --> 18:11.640
success through broader appeal and targeting new audiences. Its use of

18:11.640 --> 18:16.040
vibrant color and its focus on a central titular character would also go on to

18:16.040 --> 18:20.240
become video game staples and would soon be seen in other popular arcade

18:20.240 --> 18:29.400
titles like Konami's 1981 Road and River Crossing hit Frogger. By 1982 color and

18:29.400 --> 18:34.640
3D technology were being combined in even more impressive ways like in Namco's

18:34.640 --> 18:39.960
visually striking racing simulator Pole Position and the arcade Golden Age was

18:39.960 --> 18:45.040
in full swing with profits from games reaching new heights and Taito, Atari

18:45.080 --> 18:51.880
and Namco establishing themselves as the three biggest developers around. Arcades

18:51.880 --> 18:56.360
were more than just a place to play games however. Through features like high

18:56.360 --> 19:00.600
scores, multiplayer and the ability to watch and compete in front of other

19:00.600 --> 19:06.440
people arcades provided a social aspect to gaming that went beyond just playing.

19:06.440 --> 19:12.080
Much like how Twitch allows people to watch, discuss and compete in various

19:12.120 --> 19:17.200
games today arcades were the live streaming and esports of the 20th

19:17.200 --> 19:21.440
century and they offered better gaming experiences than you could get in your

19:21.440 --> 19:26.840
home with higher quality graphics, better sound and unique immersive elements

19:26.840 --> 19:32.040
like wheels and pedals in racing game cabinets. Arcades would also have a

19:32.040 --> 19:37.160
significant impact on future game design. Their quarter hungry monetization

19:37.160 --> 19:41.680
method has sometimes led to criticism over their high difficulty with older

19:41.680 --> 19:45.480
console games also sometimes coming under fire for inheriting that high

19:45.480 --> 19:50.680
difficulty but popular arcade titles knew that if difficulty was the only

19:50.680 --> 19:54.560
thing they had to offer players wouldn't have any reason to keep coming back

19:54.560 --> 19:59.640
and so they learned how to make skill-based challenges fun and make

19:59.640 --> 20:05.840
players want to improve and keep playing. Still as important as arcades were

20:05.840 --> 20:10.040
Space Invaders legacy goes beyond just kicking off the Golden Age of arcades

20:10.320 --> 20:14.960
and breaking sales records because it also turned things around for the home

20:14.960 --> 20:23.360
video game market and Atari. In 1980 Space Invaders came to the 2600 allowing

20:23.360 --> 20:29.480
people to play the arcade classic from the comfort of their home. This was the

20:29.480 --> 20:33.680
first arcade to home console port and it wouldn't be the last.

20:40.040 --> 21:09.040
Space Invaders for the 2600 became the first ever killer app or system

21:09.040 --> 21:15.280
seller in video game history and it certainly sold systems with Atari's

21:15.280 --> 21:20.800
consumer sales almost doubling to $200 million in the year it released before

21:20.800 --> 21:28.000
skyrocketing to over 800 million in 1981 with Atari taking 65% of the global

21:28.000 --> 21:34.040
market share and so the great console battle royale that had defined so much

21:34.040 --> 21:40.760
of the 70s was over and Atari was the runaway winner. A victory that proved to

21:40.760 --> 21:44.520
be surprisingly short-lived.

21:48.520 --> 21:56.760
In 1982 Atari was the fastest growing company in American history yet by the

21:56.760 --> 22:02.680
end of 1983 they were one of the fastest falling with yearly losses of over

22:02.680 --> 22:07.960
$500 million amidst the slide in parent company Warner's stock of almost 70%.

22:07.960 --> 22:15.560
In 1984 Atari was sold with Warner receiving no cash for the sale and

22:15.560 --> 22:25.600
never again would Atari be a leader in the video game industry. So what happened?

22:25.600 --> 22:32.520
Well there is an obvious answer but that only tells part of the story. To really

22:32.520 --> 22:38.640
understand we need to rewind a bit and look at where Atari came from. When Nolan

22:38.640 --> 22:43.000
Bushnell and Ted Danby decided to start a video game company together they both

22:43.000 --> 22:50.360
pitched in $250 of their own money to get the company off the ground. By 1982

22:50.360 --> 22:57.920
Atari had 10,000 employees and were bringing in $1.7 billion in operating

22:57.920 --> 23:04.640
profit and this all happened in the space of around 10 years. Atari had a

23:04.640 --> 23:09.960
colorful history and some important people once worked there including Steve

23:09.960 --> 23:15.240
Jobs and Steve Wozniak who left after a few years to start their own company by

23:15.240 --> 23:21.040
the name of Apple as well as a young programmer by the name of Bill Gates who

23:21.040 --> 23:26.600
was fired for not doing enough work. Atari also had a bit of a reputation for

23:26.600 --> 23:32.960
their relaxed office culture. You know flexible hours, informal dress code, the

23:32.960 --> 23:39.080
usual sort of thing. As we had a lot of young people we would constantly offer to

23:39.080 --> 23:44.320
throw a party if they hit quota and it turns out when you've got 18, 19, 20

23:44.320 --> 23:48.080
year olds they're much more interested in the party than an extra you know 50

23:48.080 --> 23:53.840
cents an hour. So we got known as a party company. There's a story that if you

23:53.840 --> 24:00.680
walked by the Borega Street building and you breathed deeply by the air vents

24:00.680 --> 24:05.120
you'd get stoned because the pot smoking inside of it was so heavy. This made

24:05.120 --> 24:10.840
them a popular place to work but it didn't last. The gaming industry was at

24:10.840 --> 24:16.960
the cutting edge of technology which meant to compete and to win funding was

24:16.960 --> 24:23.100
necessary. Hence the move to become a subsidiary of Warner in 1976 which

24:23.100 --> 24:30.240
brought in a 120 million dollar cash injection and made the 2600's 1977

24:30.240 --> 24:35.740
release possible. Warner communications were a big business however meaning

24:35.740 --> 24:41.340
they took a keen interest in how their new subsidiary was being run. To this end

24:41.340 --> 24:47.180
Warner brought in an experienced business exec Ray Kassar in 1978 to help

24:47.180 --> 24:53.140
with marketing and commercialization but as the influence of Warner grew so too

24:53.140 --> 24:57.500
did conflict with then CEO Nolan Bushnell particularly over Bushnell's

24:57.500 --> 25:01.340
desire to continue to invest in research and development for new

25:01.340 --> 25:06.740
technologically superior consoles. This ultimately led to Bushnell's departure

25:06.740 --> 25:12.740
in late 1978. He would go on to found American restaurant chain Chuck E Cheese

25:12.780 --> 25:18.380
and Atari went on to soaring new heights now with a more professional work

25:18.380 --> 25:24.500
culture under the oversight of Kassar. Conflict wouldn't end here however.

25:24.500 --> 25:30.620
Atari was succeeding but they were also changing and not everyone was happy with

25:30.620 --> 25:36.820
their new direction. In 1979 four experienced Atari programmers David

25:36.820 --> 25:42.100
Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead resigned over Atari's policy

25:42.100 --> 25:47.780
to not credit or provide royalties to the actual game developers. These

25:47.780 --> 25:51.780
engineers would create a software program that would result in twenty thirty

25:51.780 --> 25:56.060
million dollars in sales and they were making this a little paltry salary and

25:56.060 --> 26:01.060
they figured gee I'd like to get a penny or two or three per each cartridge. So we

26:01.060 --> 26:04.900
go to the president of Atari and point that out and he said to us and I'll

26:04.900 --> 26:10.260
quote he said you are no more important to that game than the person on the

26:10.260 --> 26:14.700
assembly line who puts it together. So they figured if they weren't going to

26:14.700 --> 26:20.180
get credit for their work why do that work for someone else which led them to

26:20.180 --> 26:26.220
form their own company. Activision the first ever third-party developer who

26:26.220 --> 26:32.020
made sure to emphasize the role of game creators on their products. Atari

26:32.020 --> 26:36.220
responded like the true corporate powerhouse they were at this time and

26:36.260 --> 26:40.700
sued Activision but they weren't successful at preventing them from

26:40.700 --> 26:45.020
producing games for Atari consoles and instead a deal was agreed where the

26:45.020 --> 26:49.620
third-party company would pay a portion of their sales as a license fee to the

26:49.620 --> 26:55.580
console owner a system that's existed ever since. Activision were only the

26:55.580 --> 27:00.100
start of Atari's problems though. Other senior developers would also jump ship

27:00.100 --> 27:05.940
but it was in early 1982 that marked the beginning of the end when Atari

27:06.180 --> 27:11.220
tried to repeat the earlier magic of their space invaders and asteroids arcade

27:11.220 --> 27:19.140
ports with Pac-Man for the 2600. The problem was Pac-Man was no space

27:19.140 --> 27:26.940
invaders or asteroids. Released originally in 1980 it ran on 1980s arcade

27:26.940 --> 27:32.820
technology with vibrant color smooth animations and high quality sound. All

27:32.900 --> 27:38.940
things for now dated 2600 struggled with. The result is a port that will forever

27:38.940 --> 27:45.300
live in infamy as one of the worst of all time a Pac-Man in name and not much

27:45.300 --> 27:51.380
else. Still Atari's disappointments that year were only just getting started.

27:51.380 --> 27:57.780
November saw the release of the 5200 Atari's next generation home system

27:58.020 --> 28:04.380
which kicked off the 16-bit era. Unfortunately despite being early to the

28:04.380 --> 28:10.300
market there wasn't much else the 5200 had going for it. Its initial price

28:10.300 --> 28:15.460
point of $270 was high, it didn't originally come with backwards

28:15.460 --> 28:20.900
compatibility, there were few new titles released for it and the controller was

28:20.900 --> 28:26.180
widely criticized and while its graphics and hardware were a step up from the

28:26.500 --> 28:32.060
2600 and other 8-bit systems the upgrade they provided was small and poorly

28:32.060 --> 28:36.620
shown by the few titles the 5200 had available which tended to just be

28:36.620 --> 28:42.940
ports of 2600 games. Nolan Bushnell is reported to have left Atari over

28:42.940 --> 28:46.620
disagreements with the direction of future console technology and the

28:46.620 --> 28:53.660
commercial failure of the Atari 5200 seemed to vindicate his stance. Finally

28:53.660 --> 29:00.780
to top Atari's year off there was E.T. which released just in time for the holiday season.

29:23.660 --> 29:40.220
E.T. has regularly been called the worst video game of all time. This may be

29:40.220 --> 29:46.540
rather harsh but history is rarely known for its kindness. Still worst of all time

29:46.540 --> 29:51.860
or not E.T. is certainly symbolic and it's a perfect example of a hubris that

29:51.860 --> 29:58.020
brought Atari's downfall. Atari had acquired a license at high cost for an

29:58.020 --> 30:02.220
E.T. game following the success of the movie but they wanted the game released

30:02.220 --> 30:07.820
in time for Christmas to take advantage of increased holiday sales. This meant a

30:07.820 --> 30:12.380
development time of only a few months and so they brought in experienced

30:12.380 --> 30:17.420
developer Howard Scott Warshaw who had just completed the ambitious and

30:17.460 --> 30:23.980
critically acclaimed Yars Revenge. Warshaw embraced a short development time as a unique

30:23.980 --> 30:30.500
challenge and tried to do the miraculous. He failed and the result is a confusing

30:30.500 --> 30:34.100
adventure game that had little connection to the original movie beyond its

30:34.100 --> 30:39.860
strangely shaped protagonist. This didn't faze Atari however who skipped

30:39.860 --> 30:44.820
audience testing to save time and produced an optimistic five million copies

30:45.180 --> 30:54.300
for retailers only a fraction of which ended up selling. E.T. was a bad game but in this way it

30:54.300 --> 30:59.700
wasn't unique. In fact after the success of Activision more and more developers

30:59.700 --> 31:04.900
entered the third party space. This was before game developers needed a license

31:04.900 --> 31:09.860
to publish games on consoles which created a free-for-all where quality was a

31:09.860 --> 31:14.020
much smaller concern than profit and where accusations of industrial

31:14.060 --> 31:19.940
espionage and reverse engineering became rampant due to third party developers lack

31:19.940 --> 31:25.540
of familiarity with the hardware of the system they were designing games for. By

31:25.540 --> 31:30.700
the start of 1983 at least 100 different companies were developing games for the

31:30.700 --> 31:37.900
2600 in a rush to cash in on the now booming video game craze. In the process

31:37.900 --> 31:43.100
quality control was often ignored and in this period consumers had few ways to

31:43.140 --> 31:49.900
differentiate between good and bad games before it was already too late. As the

31:49.900 --> 31:53.740
market continued to become increasingly saturated with low quality games

31:53.740 --> 31:58.740
retailers were forced to discount stock to try to get rid of these games

31:58.740 --> 32:04.420
encouraging consumers to continue purchasing the now discounted bad games

32:04.420 --> 32:09.860
leading to a loss of consumer confidence which even video game Titan Atari

32:10.100 --> 32:16.580
wasn't exempt from. In fact Atari likely deserved more of the blame than anyone.

32:17.700 --> 32:24.740
Pac-Man for the 2600 was a bad game but it was also the best selling video game

32:24.740 --> 32:30.260
of all time and even then Atari still produced far more copies than they

32:30.260 --> 32:37.300
ultimately sold. And so with a saturated market little quality control rapidly

32:37.420 --> 32:41.660
depleting consumer confidence and even more emergent competition from the

32:41.660 --> 32:47.180
home computer market the gaming industry did the inevitable and sunk

32:47.180 --> 32:52.660
spectacularly in the great gaming crash of 1983.

32:52.660 --> 32:57.580
Video game sales have gone tilt the boom simply isn't booming anymore.

32:57.580 --> 33:02.980
If Pac-Man, ET and Raiders of the Lost Ark aren't selling what will.

33:03.260 --> 33:09.420
To understand the scale of this disaster it helps to look at the numbers. In 1983

33:09.420 --> 33:17.900
home video game revenues peaked at 3.2 billion dollars. By 1985 this number

33:17.900 --> 33:27.220
had fallen to 100 million a decrease of almost 97%. Once quarterly earnings

33:27.220 --> 33:31.500
started to reveal the degree to which games had stopped selling investors

33:31.660 --> 33:36.140
started panicking cashing out their gaming stock and effectively ending the

33:36.140 --> 33:41.420
supply of new money that had previously supported the once growing market. As a

33:41.420 --> 33:47.260
result many newer gaming companies went bankrupt. Mattel, Coleco and Magnavox

33:47.260 --> 33:52.780
all discontinued their gaming lines entirely and Atari was sold for almost

33:52.780 --> 33:57.220
nothing with hundreds of thousands of on-soul games being famously dumped

33:57.220 --> 34:03.740
and buried in a landfill in New Mexico. Arcades still saw some popularity but

34:03.740 --> 34:07.900
they once more entered into a period of decline with the golden age having now

34:07.900 --> 34:15.580
come to an abrupt end. And so video games were officially over being once more

34:15.580 --> 34:20.100
seen as nothing but a short-lived fad not so different from other popular

34:20.100 --> 34:24.780
toy lines that burn bright and then burn out once consumers get bored of them.

34:25.540 --> 34:31.060
And this is how they would continue to be seen in America for the next two years

34:31.060 --> 34:43.260
until a new name entered the scene. While the American gaming industry crashed

34:43.260 --> 34:49.660
and burned in 1983 across the Pacific in gaming's second largest market the year

34:49.660 --> 34:53.740
would be remembered for a different reason. The release of the Nintendo

34:53.740 --> 35:00.900
family computer also known as the Famicom. It wasn't until 1985 that

35:00.900 --> 35:04.540
Nintendo would bring their new console across the Pacific and rescue the

35:04.540 --> 35:09.940
American gaming industry but for Nintendo the story starts much earlier.

35:09.940 --> 35:16.660
Founded in 1889 Nintendo began life as a playing card manufacturer before

35:16.660 --> 35:22.580
diversifying into tabletop games and eventually electronic toys. Their first

35:22.620 --> 35:28.940
foray into video games came from making light gun accessories but in 1977 they

35:28.940 --> 35:34.140
went a step further with the release of the Color TV game a Japanese only

35:34.140 --> 35:39.300
dedicated home console inspired by the success of Magnavox and Atari which

35:39.300 --> 35:48.300
contained Pong in six different variants. In Nintendo's defense at least they paid

35:48.340 --> 35:55.740
Magnavox for a license unlike most. The Color TV game sold well thanks in part to

35:55.740 --> 36:01.140
its modest price and Nintendo went on to reduce several more variants all for

36:01.140 --> 36:05.700
their home market of Japan. They also entered the arcade space with a game

36:05.700 --> 36:10.980
based on the board game of Fellow. It was during this period but a fresh faced

36:10.980 --> 36:16.820
25 year old by the name of Shigeru Miyamoto joined the company but Miyamoto

36:16.860 --> 36:22.260
would not be Nintendo's first gaming superstar. That honor belongs to one

36:22.260 --> 36:27.100
Gunpei Yokoi head of Nintendo's research and development one division and

36:27.100 --> 36:33.900
creator of the iconic handheld game and watch. Apparently inspired by Yokoi

36:33.900 --> 36:38.460
watching a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator on a train the

36:38.460 --> 36:43.180
game and watch was an early dedicated handheld with an LCD display and fixed

36:43.220 --> 36:50.420
animations. It also pioneered the D-pad. In expensive and long running the game

36:50.420 --> 36:54.260
and watch's sales blew most early handheld competition out of the water

36:54.260 --> 37:00.140
selling more units than even Atari's 2600 over the course of its lifetime but

37:00.140 --> 37:05.900
Nintendo was only just getting started. After several less successful arcade

37:05.900 --> 37:13.060
attempts the company's next big break came with 1981's Donkey Kong designed by

37:13.260 --> 37:17.260
Miyamoto with the oversight of Yokoi it was originally developed as a way to

37:17.260 --> 37:21.540
reuse old cabinets of Miyamoto's previous and rather less successful

37:21.540 --> 37:28.300
radar scope. Donkey Kong took inspiration from Popeye and featured the titular

37:28.300 --> 37:32.660
ape as the game's barrel-throwing antagonist alongside the player controlled

37:32.660 --> 37:37.620
jump man who would go on to become one of the most recognizable characters in

37:37.620 --> 37:43.940
the world after he was renamed to Mario. Donkey Kong was one of the earliest

37:43.940 --> 37:49.020
platformers and the first game to feature jumping. It also broke new ground

37:49.020 --> 37:53.700
in narrative design featuring a complete storyline told entirely on screen

37:53.700 --> 37:58.300
with Donkey Kong kidnapping Mario's girlfriend who the player then works to

37:58.300 --> 38:04.340
rescue before finally watching the two be reunited. It was also a massive hit

38:04.700 --> 38:08.540
establishing Nintendo's name internationally and creating a bid and war

38:08.540 --> 38:14.860
between console rivals Atari and Coleco over the rights to publish it. Nintendo

38:14.860 --> 38:19.580
would follow Donkey Kong with multiple sequels but it was their return to home

38:19.580 --> 38:29.220
consoles that would change the gaming industry forever. At first glance the

38:29.220 --> 38:35.180
Famicom didn't look that remarkable. It was an 8-bit system in a time when Atari

38:35.180 --> 38:39.700
had already given the world 16 bits of power and home computers were quickly

38:39.700 --> 38:45.300
becoming more powerful still. Yet the Famicom did have a dedicated picture

38:45.300 --> 38:51.260
processing unit in addition to its CPU as well as a reasonable launch price of

38:51.260 --> 38:56.980
just under 15,000 yen. Its greatest asset would eventually be its game

38:57.020 --> 39:01.540
selection but an impressive library took time and the Famicom's first year on

39:01.540 --> 39:07.020
the Japanese market saw it get off to a slow start. It would pick up momentum

39:07.020 --> 39:12.300
eventually however and the great gaming crash of 1983 didn't have nearly as

39:12.300 --> 39:17.300
large an impact on Japan as it did America meaning by the end of 1984

39:17.300 --> 39:21.620
Nintendo's family computer had become the best-selling console in Japan and

39:21.780 --> 39:28.500
was well on its way to becoming Nintendo's greatest success yet. This still

39:28.500 --> 39:34.620
left Nintendo's toughest challenge though America which in 1985 was still

39:34.620 --> 39:38.980
reeling from the earlier crash with confidence in video games at an all-time

39:38.980 --> 39:44.740
low. To get retailers to even stock their console Nintendo had to make buyback

39:44.740 --> 39:49.500
deals in case of poor sales but that still left the even bigger problem of

39:49.860 --> 39:55.740
selling the console in the first place. I mean how do you sell a gaming console to

39:55.740 --> 40:01.340
a country that doesn't want anything to do with video games? Well Nintendo's

40:01.340 --> 40:04.940
answer was to pretend that it was something different.

40:19.540 --> 40:25.100
The extraordinary video robot he follows the commands you put on screen to help

40:25.100 --> 40:29.380
you tackle even the toughest challenge. Will you be the first to raise the

40:29.380 --> 40:34.380
incredibly accurate zapper and play games like Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. The

40:34.380 --> 40:39.700
first to build a library of game packs like Kung Fu and Golf. Even games like

40:39.700 --> 40:44.140
Excitebite that you program yourself. Will you be the first to get all this in

40:44.140 --> 40:49.500
one package? The Nintendo Entertainment System where video technology is more

40:49.500 --> 40:55.300
than a game. Enter the Nintendo Entertainment System not just a

40:55.300 --> 41:00.340
video game console but something brand new and it wasn't just about the name.

41:00.340 --> 41:05.260
The NES was designed to look like a video cassette recorder rather than a

41:05.260 --> 41:10.980
console. Its cartridges were rebranded as game packs and it shipped with several

41:10.980 --> 41:17.420
accessories like the robotic operating buddy Rob and the iconic light gun which

41:17.420 --> 41:22.780
marketing made sure to emphasize as much as possible. Nintendo's work didn't

41:22.780 --> 41:28.020
stop here though as they had an entire gaming market to rebuild and so the

41:28.020 --> 41:33.660
number one priority became restoring consumer trust in video games. To do

41:33.660 --> 41:37.940
this they strictly controlled third-party development putting limitations on

41:37.940 --> 41:43.460
companies to avoid the oversaturation that have plagued Atari. In Japan this

41:43.460 --> 41:48.380
led to a growing bootleg market so with the NES Nintendo added a special

41:48.380 --> 41:53.660
lockout chip to combat this while creating an official Nintendo seal of

41:53.660 --> 41:59.980
approval to allow buyers to identify Nintendo licensed products. And as for

41:59.980 --> 42:04.620
those products Nintendo also paved the way for their console launch with arcade

42:04.620 --> 42:11.340
releases of the same games through the Nintendo versus system in 1984 which was

42:11.340 --> 42:16.620
built on similar hardware to the Famicom. This not only helped spread Nintendo's

42:16.620 --> 42:21.260
name before the release of the NES but also established a trend of console

42:21.260 --> 42:26.260
titles matching the quality of their arcade counterparts to try to repair the

42:26.260 --> 42:33.740
damage of games like Pac-Man for the 2600. Nintendo even shifted to using in-game

42:33.780 --> 42:39.180
like box art in place of the detailed yet dissimilar artwork of so many earlier

42:39.180 --> 42:46.140
games. All this had an impact but Nintendo had one final ace up their sleeve

42:46.140 --> 42:51.420
which came once more from the mind of Shigeru Miyamoto and would mark the

42:51.420 --> 43:00.180
arrival of gaming's next killer app. Released in the same year as the NES

43:00.220 --> 43:06.500
Super Mario Bros set a new standard. For years players had grown accustomed to

43:06.500 --> 43:12.820
games taking place on a single screen and then in came Mario with side-scrolling

43:12.820 --> 43:18.620
platforming action across multiple screens, multiple levels, multiple

43:18.620 --> 43:23.660
environments and all with different power-ups, boss fights and jaw-dropping

43:23.660 --> 43:29.100
hidden secrets. To top it all off Super Mario featured precise controls that took

43:29.140 --> 43:35.060
full advantage of Nintendo's new D-pad controllers alongside detailed vibrant

43:35.060 --> 43:40.140
visuals and one of the most iconic soundtracks in video game history from

43:40.140 --> 43:46.420
composer Koji Kondo. Mario even had a strong sense of identity. By this point

43:46.420 --> 43:51.460
in time a lot of games had featured space combat, sport simulations and fighting

43:51.460 --> 43:58.180
but Mario offered something genuinely unique. You played as a shape-changing

43:58.380 --> 44:03.900
mushroom-eating turtle-stomping Italian plumber who warped between worlds while

44:03.900 --> 44:09.700
searching for a princess and somehow the concept worked with a childlike charm

44:09.700 --> 44:16.820
that appealed to all ages. And so Super Mario Bros was a landmark title that

44:16.820 --> 44:21.780
kicked off the greatest selling video game franchise of all time but it's not

44:21.780 --> 44:28.380
like the NES only had Mario. In fact only a year and a half later the Nintendo

44:28.380 --> 44:33.300
entertainment system would see the arrival of another gaming legend once

44:33.300 --> 44:44.060
more from the mind of Miyamoto. The legend of Zelda did to action adventure games

44:44.060 --> 44:49.540
what Super Mario Bros did to platformers. With a massive fantasy world fully

44:49.580 --> 44:54.300
open to players and packed with secrets Zelda offered a sense of adventure and

44:54.300 --> 45:00.100
freedom to explore never before seen in a console game. It was also the first

45:00.100 --> 45:04.940
console game to feature a save system thanks to battery-powered memory built

45:04.940 --> 45:10.540
into the game's cartridge which helped support its more ambitious design. And

45:10.540 --> 45:18.500
once more the legend of Zelda was a huge critical and commercial success. As time

45:18.540 --> 45:23.660
went on the NES's impressive library grew and grew launching many of gaming's

45:23.660 --> 45:27.660
most loved series and establishing many of the rules of game design that would

45:27.660 --> 45:32.580
continue to be seen for years to come. Castlevania brought action-packed Gothic

45:32.580 --> 45:38.180
horror, Metroid brought atmospheric sci-fi, Mega Man offered alternative high

45:38.180 --> 45:42.860
quality platforming action, Metal Gear helped popularize the stealth genre and

45:42.860 --> 45:48.020
Dragon Quest and for later Final Fantasy established the Japanese console

45:48.020 --> 45:52.900
role-playing genre. The NES was also well supported by high quality arcade

45:52.900 --> 45:59.860
ports like Ghosts and Goblins, Contra and Double Dragon as well as a range of

45:59.860 --> 46:06.420
Nintendo original sports games providing even more diversity. Basically the NES

46:06.420 --> 46:11.140
had everything and it conquered the American and later European console

46:11.140 --> 46:17.740
markets getting the gaming industry back in business in the process. This didn't

46:17.740 --> 46:21.900
happen overnight and the damage done to the American market really was

46:21.900 --> 46:28.020
significant but by 1989 the console market had finally bounced back close to

46:28.020 --> 46:34.100
earlier levels with consumer confidence largely restored. Over its lifetime the

46:34.100 --> 46:39.940
NES and Famicom sold around 62 million units which was more than double the

46:39.940 --> 46:44.780
Atari 2600 making the NES the best-selling console of the time and

46:44.820 --> 46:49.740
still one of the best-selling to this day. And with Nintendo's console

46:49.740 --> 46:53.580
supremacy and so many American companies having exited the market

46:53.580 --> 46:58.100
following the earlier crash, Japan was able to take center stage of the gaming

46:58.100 --> 47:04.740
industry with Nintendo's name becoming synonymous with video games. Still even if

47:04.740 --> 47:09.100
Nintendo had taken a sizable lead they wouldn't remain unchallenged for long

47:09.100 --> 47:14.540
as another Japanese company was about to make their attempt at beating Nintendo

47:14.900 --> 47:16.100
at their own game.

47:23.100 --> 47:27.980
Sega was a big name in arcades. They entered the Japanese home console market

47:27.980 --> 47:32.180
at the same time as Nintendo when the arcade Golden Age was starting to wind

47:32.180 --> 47:39.700
down. Their first console the SG-1000 released in 1983 on the very same day

47:40.180 --> 47:44.740
as Nintendo's Famicom but it would struggle to compete with Nintendo's

47:44.740 --> 47:49.180
superior system likely as a result of Sega's inexperience with console

47:49.180 --> 47:56.700
development. In 1985 it was redesigned as the Sega Mark 3 which released in

47:56.700 --> 48:01.300
North America in 1986 as the Sega Master System.

48:09.700 --> 48:35.620
The Master System went head-to-head with the NES while copying much of its

48:35.620 --> 48:40.900
marketing strategy. In terms of hardware it had a clear advantage with a wider

48:40.900 --> 48:45.860
color palette and a small edge in raw power but this wouldn't be enough to

48:45.860 --> 48:52.660
make up for its biggest weakness its lack of third-party support. To publish games

48:52.660 --> 48:58.820
on the NES licensees had to agree to a strict two-year non-compete clause that

48:58.820 --> 49:04.460
didn't allow them to bring their titles to Nintendo's competition. This left the

49:04.460 --> 49:08.980
Master System with a much smaller library and while Sega were able to bring

49:08.980 --> 49:13.420
their own first-party arcade titles including the fast-paced rail shooter

49:13.420 --> 49:18.420
Space Harrier and iconic racing game Outrun two of the best arcade titles of

49:18.420 --> 49:23.180
the mid-80s this ultimately didn't prove to be enough and even these games

49:23.180 --> 49:29.300
were still inferior on console than as arcade originals. This ensured that

49:29.300 --> 49:34.220
Sega failed to come close to matching Nintendo in Japan or North America

49:34.220 --> 49:38.820
although they did do enough to overtake a flagging Atari who under new

49:38.820 --> 49:44.780
management had released their own third-generation console the 7800 a system

49:44.780 --> 49:50.740
notable for its innovative backwards compatibility and little else. Still by

49:50.740 --> 49:56.220
this point gaming was global and so Sega turned their attention to other markets.

49:56.820 --> 50:01.540
In Europe the NES had failed to achieve the same level of success as in America

50:01.540 --> 50:06.500
with Nintendo taking a more hands-off approach and leaving the distribution to

50:06.500 --> 50:12.300
other companies. It also arrived notably late with most countries not seeing the

50:12.300 --> 50:18.780
NES until 1987. This was the same year Sega brought over the Master System and

50:18.780 --> 50:23.620
with no more head start and Sega's strong reputation as an arcade developer

50:23.620 --> 50:31.060
Sega started to beat Nintendo for the very first time. By 1990 the Master

50:31.060 --> 50:37.060
System was Europe's best-selling console and Sega didn't stop at Europe. In fact

50:37.060 --> 50:42.100
a deal with toy and electronics company Tectoy saw Brazil become the Master

50:42.100 --> 50:48.860
System's single best-selling country after its release in 1989. By contrast the

50:48.860 --> 50:55.140
NES didn't come to Brazil until 1993 giving Sega a unique chance to capture a

50:55.140 --> 51:00.340
by no means insignificant market. Sega wouldn't be the only new challenger

51:00.340 --> 51:05.380
amidst the now once more growing gaming industry however.

51:18.860 --> 51:43.420
Hudson Soft and NEC's Turbografics 16 released in 1987 in Japan under the name

51:43.420 --> 51:50.740
PC Engine and in 1989 in America and Europe. The console was so eager to let

51:50.740 --> 51:55.100
consumers know that it was a 16-bit rather than 8-bit system that it

51:55.100 --> 52:01.060
included it in the name kicking off what is sometimes referred to as the Bit Wars

52:01.060 --> 52:07.300
as well as the fourth generation of home consoles. As the first truly next-gen

52:07.300 --> 52:11.620
system the Turbografics did boast some impressive hardware with a higher

52:11.660 --> 52:18.420
resolution and expanded color palette to go alongside its 16-bit GPU. This was

52:18.420 --> 52:22.580
matched with some impressive sales in its home region of Japan with the system

52:22.580 --> 52:26.340
getting off to a flying start and beating out the NES in its year of

52:26.340 --> 52:30.940
release. Unfortunately this strong performance wasn't replicated in other

52:30.940 --> 52:35.420
regions with poor marketing and a delayed release leading to commercial

52:35.420 --> 52:41.900
failure in North America and cancelled plans in Europe. Still for Sega this new

52:41.900 --> 52:47.060
competition represented a clear threat and so in response they immediately began

52:47.060 --> 52:53.740
working on their own 16-bit system. It was finished one year later long before

52:53.740 --> 52:58.300
Nintendo would have a 16-bit system themselves and it turned out to be

52:58.300 --> 53:00.420
Sega's best console yet.

53:29.300 --> 53:36.260
The Sega Genesis otherwise known as the Mega Drive outside America released in

53:36.260 --> 53:44.900
1988 in Japan, 1989 in America and 1990 in other regions and with it Sega now had

53:44.900 --> 53:50.020
a system powerful enough to do justice to their expansive arcade library as well

53:50.020 --> 53:56.820
as a clear technological lead on their main rival Nintendo. They even had a new

53:56.940 --> 53:58.940
marketing slogan.

54:17.940 --> 54:23.660
And so heading into the next decade the console war was finally heating up with

54:23.660 --> 54:29.660
one of gaming's greatest rivalries about one-fold. The only thing Sega still

54:29.660 --> 54:34.980
needed was a killer app of their own that could finally go head-to-head with

54:34.980 --> 54:41.300
Nintendo's popular mascot Mario. But for Nintendo there was no reason to panic

54:41.300 --> 54:46.740
just yet as the end of the 80s saw them release a new system of their own one

54:46.740 --> 54:50.940
that would go on to outsell all of their previous systems combined.

54:57.940 --> 55:03.940
Nintendo's Game & Watch was a success but its LCD technology limited it to one

55:03.940 --> 55:09.700
game per system. For Gunpei Yokoi's next console he wanted to create a handheld

55:09.700 --> 55:14.740
device with interchangeable games that offered an NES-like experience on the

55:14.740 --> 55:16.740
go. This was the result.

55:45.740 --> 55:52.620
The Game Boy released in 1989 and was around in various iterations for the

55:52.620 --> 55:58.500
next 20 years during which Nintendo dominated the handheld market the

55:58.500 --> 56:05.140
entire time. It did require four AA batteries but this was a price players

56:05.140 --> 56:11.220
were more than happy to pay. It also lacked a backlight which was more of an

56:11.220 --> 56:15.500
issue. A contrast dial was included but this still meant the system was

56:15.500 --> 56:20.380
unplayable without a light source and even in a well-lit environment the gray

56:20.380 --> 56:27.220
and green color scheme didn't provide the best clarity or general aesthetic. To

56:27.220 --> 56:31.380
make matters worse the Game Boy released against heavy competition with three

56:31.380 --> 56:36.220
other handhelds also vying for dominance at the same time. Atari's Lynx,

56:36.220 --> 56:44.220
Sega's Game Gear and NEC's Turbo Express. All three of these rivals blew the

56:44.220 --> 56:50.060
Game Boy away in technical capabilities featuring not only a backlit screen but

56:50.060 --> 56:55.740
also full-color and far more impressive graphics. By comparison the drab

56:55.740 --> 57:00.860
grays and greens of the Game Boy must have seemed rather pathetic. A sentiment

57:00.860 --> 57:05.900
held by many even at Nintendo during its development where the Game Boy had earned

57:05.900 --> 57:14.300
the nickname DUMMER GAME a pun which basically translates to BAD GAME. In the

57:14.300 --> 57:18.460
end though the Game Boy wound up punching far above its weight and easily

57:18.460 --> 57:23.140
surpassed all competition proving that in the constantly advancing battleground

57:23.140 --> 57:27.980
of cutting-edge technology that is the gaming industry sometimes having the

57:27.980 --> 57:33.020
best specs isn't what matters the most. You see in return for a less

57:33.100 --> 57:37.100
technologically advanced product Nintendo offered something at a more

57:37.100 --> 57:42.460
affordable price with a much longer battery life and a durable more

57:42.460 --> 57:48.700
child-proof design. If success was down to critics the Game Boy would have come

57:48.700 --> 57:54.380
last. In reality however success is decided by the consumer which in this

57:54.380 --> 58:00.860
case often meant parents and it turned out that in this example practicality

58:00.860 --> 58:07.260
and affordability beat superior technology and it wasn't even close. For

58:07.260 --> 58:11.100
Gunpei Yokoi this must have been the ultimate vindication of his design

58:11.100 --> 58:15.740
philosophy which has been translated as lateral thinking with

58:15.740 --> 58:21.100
withered technology i.e achieving success through finding new and

58:21.100 --> 58:27.980
innovative ways to use cheap or mature technology. In an industry obsessed with

58:27.980 --> 58:31.980
the cutting-edge this has been successfully employed by Nintendo

58:31.980 --> 58:37.180
time and time again and despite Yokoi's unfortunate death in 1997

58:37.180 --> 58:42.140
his philosophy can still be seen within the company to this day.

58:42.140 --> 58:46.300
Of course this is only part of the Game Boy's success story

58:46.300 --> 58:51.900
because it also had another advantage over the competition.

58:51.900 --> 58:57.020
Designed inside the Soviet Union by Alexey Pachinov in 1984

58:57.020 --> 59:02.860
Tetris began life as more of a benchmark than an actual video game.

59:02.860 --> 59:06.700
In a time long before anyone could ask can it play crisis

59:06.700 --> 59:10.700
computer engineer Pachinov had to settle for developing his own games

59:10.700 --> 59:15.100
as a way to test the capabilities of the latest hardware.

59:15.100 --> 59:18.700
The idea for Tetris came from trying to recreate the puzzle game

59:18.700 --> 59:24.700
Pentominos when Pachinov had the idea to make the pieces descend vertically.

59:24.700 --> 59:29.260
The lack of a graphical interface on the Electronica 60 Pachinov was working on

59:29.260 --> 59:34.140
did pose a slight problem but it wasn't enough to stop Tetris's core idea from

59:34.140 --> 59:37.740
being enjoyable and soon Pachinov was sharing his

59:37.740 --> 59:42.700
creation with his friends and eventually making an IBM PC version

59:42.700 --> 59:47.180
with the help of a talented 16 year old school student.

59:47.180 --> 59:50.460
From here Tetris spread like a contagious virus

59:50.460 --> 59:54.940
first infecting Pachinov's office then the whole Academy of Science

59:54.940 --> 59:59.020
before moving across Moscow and then beyond

59:59.020 --> 01:00:02.220
doing what few Soviet citizens of the time could do

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.020
and crossing the Iron Curtain. This kicked off a race from multiple eager

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:11.580
parties to acquire the rights of the game for broader distribution in the west.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.660
The only problem with the situation was that the Soviet Union

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.780
didn't really believe in copyright law

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:22.700
outside of everything should be controlled by the state

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.500
leading to confusion over who owned the rights of the game

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.700
and a complicated battle between different competing parties

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:32.220
with plenty of buying and selling of rights that sellers

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:37.980
didn't actually own. The ultimate winner was game designer Henk Rogers

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:43.740
who acquired the rights for Nintendo. The original plan for the Game Boy was to

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.820
sell it alongside the new Mario title Super Mario Land

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.900
but Nintendo was so impressed by Tetris after Rogers showed it to them

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:55.580
that they followed his advice to use it instead

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.380
in the hopes that its simple addictive nature

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.540
could transcend experience age and gender barriers

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:07.420
to be a game that everyone could enjoy and it was.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:11.340
At first glance Tetris might seem similar to popular arcade games of 10

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.340
years earlier but with no concerns about maximizing quarters

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.540
Tetris considerably lowered the initial difficulty

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.700
and this did result in a game that anyone could play

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.860
as it eased people into the experience while naturally building tension and

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:30.940
excitement as the game progressed. Tetris required

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.980
fast moment-to-moment reactions as well as broader

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.580
more strategic planning and when players made a mistake

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.140
it was obvious where they went wrong and what they could do better next time.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.660
For the pick up and play Game Boy it was a perfect match

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.940
and it went on to sell tens of millions of copies

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:54.060
on Nintendo's new system alone as well as many millions more

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:58.460
across PC NES and later mobile versions

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.540
making it potentially the best selling game ever made

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:08.220
even to this day. This helped the Game Boy get off to a strong start right from its

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:12.140
launch which meant as the 80s grew to a close

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.700
Nintendo retained their dominant position as leaders of the gaming industry

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:22.780
having far surpassed Atari and held off the new challenge presented by Sega.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:27.340
All this time however as console and arcade giants froze and fell

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.260
another section of the industry experienced its own story

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:35.180
one with a different starting place, different games

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.660
and a very different impact on the future.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:50.060
World War II was kind of a big deal. In addition to deciding the fate of a

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:53.900
global population and shaping the modern world as we know it

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.500
it also saw rapid technological advancement that would pave the way for

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:02.860
something equally important, the home computer.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:07.740
Originally computer game development was limited to only the most enthusiastic

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:12.060
hobbyists. This started in the early 70s with one

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:17.820
of the first and most well-known examples being 1971's Star Trek a

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.180
text-based strategy game where players took control of the USS

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.500
enterprise to hunt down Klingon warships.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:31.180
Other early examples include Oregon Trail a text-based strategy game best known

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:36.300
via its later incarnations 1976's Colossal Cave Adventure

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.900
a text-based adventure game inspired by real-life caving

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:45.900
and Dungeons and Dragons 1977's Empire a turn-based war game

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:52.540
inspired by the board game Risk Zork also in 1977 and also a text-based

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.980
adventure game inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.820
and Mud or Multi-User Dungeon a text-based

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:07.660
real-time multiplayer role-playing game that helped pioneer the MMO genre in 1978.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:12.060
Of these six examples all except Colossal Cave Adventure

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:18.300
were created by students. In fact Star Trek was created by a high school

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:22.140
student who had started hanging around the University of California Irving's

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:27.820
computer lab in his free time. So for computer games it was teenagers who

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.540
led the way maybe due to the younger generation's

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.220
inherent creativity but also because computers were so expensive

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:38.220
that university students were some of the only people who had reliable access

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:42.380
to them. This started to change in 1977

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:47.020
with the arrival of not one but three more affordable home computers

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:52.060
the Commodore PET, the TRS-80 and the Apple II.

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.020
If you want to know what affordable means

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.620
in numerical form well the most successful of these

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:08.860
the Apple II cost $1,298 at release which is over $6,400 after inflation.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:14.220
So maybe not affordable for most but it was a start.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:18.300
These early computers tended to ship with some games included

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:24.060
but they also came with something else. Basic, a general purpose programming

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:28.380
language that gave computer owners not just the ability to play games

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:33.340
but also to make them themselves and they did.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.380
The best known example of this is Sierra Online

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:40.300
founded by husband and wife duo Ken and Roberta Williams

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:43.900
after playing Colossal Cave Adventure and deciding to make their own

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.220
similar game on a family member's borrowed Apple II.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.580
The result was the first ever graphical adventure game

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:55.340
Mystery House, a murder mystery focused game

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:59.980
inspired by Agatha Christie novels and one of the earliest examples of both

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:05.180
graphics in a PC game and horror in any video game.

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.620
Sierra Online went on to have numerous hits including

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:14.140
King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry and Quest for Glory.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.940
Another example is a Calabeth, the first ever computer role-playing game

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:23.580
made by a teenage Richard Garriott in 1979

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.900
originally on his school's mainframe pc and finished on an Apple II

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:32.060
bought by his father. Garriott sold the game at his local

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:37.740
computer store in a ziplock bag with a cover sheet drawn by his mom

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:41.580
until a copy of the game made it to California Pacific Computer Company

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:44.620
who signed the deal with Garriott to take over publication

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:50.460
and sold 30,000 copies. The founders of Codemasters, the Darling Brothers, have a

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:54.700
similar story where they became wealthy and established game

01:06:54.700 --> 01:07:00.620
developers by the ripe old age of 16 and 17 selling

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:06.700
games by mail order from their bedroom. Arcade and console gaming became

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.580
corporate almost as soon as it came into existence

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.980
but by contrast the computer gaming industry was heavily grass roots

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:18.220
with hobbyists, bedroom coders and literal children

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.540
often leading the way laying the foundations for the entire industry

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:26.860
and proving just what these new home computers were capable of.

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:31.660
This did mean the PC scene was much slower to monetize their efforts

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.500
with piracy known at the time as sharing

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.860
being such common practice that many people weren't even aware it could be

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.460
considered wrong and what started as sharing between

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:46.300
friends quickly evolved into selling bootleg copies for a fraction of the

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.460
original price. The differences between computer

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.740
and console gaming doesn't stop here though

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:58.220
from the higher age of the average player to the higher price of the systems

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:02.220
to the vastly different control schemes to regional differences

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.900
with PC gaming particularly flourishing in Europe the same region where

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:10.700
consoles caught on the slowest. PC gaming basically grew up independently

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.940
to the rest of the gaming industry and nowhere is this more evident

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:20.700
than in actual game design. Arcade games started off simple.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.740
They were highly replayable and fiendishly challenging

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:27.740
in large part due to their monetization and they tended to focus

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:33.260
on skill-based gameplay experiences that came alongside arcade specific features

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:39.260
like high scores and lives. Console games then grew out of this foundation

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:44.220
with Atari and Sega owing much of their console success to their arcade ports

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.660
and the NES's library being packed with games which

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.300
emulated many aspects of popular arcade titles of the era.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:56.140
PC games however were quick to embrace complexity.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:00.460
Text adventures like Zork gave players a staggering amount of freedom in their

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:04.620
text inputs while mods did similar while adding in

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:10.140
other human players as well. 1980s genre pioneer Rogue

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.300
offered a huge randomly generated world for players to progress through.

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.220
Groundbreaking RPGs like 1981's Wizardry or

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.740
Ultima provided deep dungeon-crawling overworld

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:27.420
spanning adventures with plenty of statistics, classes and items.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.620
In many of these titles gameplay seemed to take a backseat

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:36.220
to trying to simulate a rich virtual world for players to become immersed in.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.940
Many of these games were still highly challenging

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:42.140
but less emphasis was placed on constant fail states

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:46.940
and replayability with difficulty instead often coming from

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.980
depth and low fidelity visuals be they text,

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:57.420
ASCII or spreadsheet were often embraced as a way to provide greater freedom

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.700
and maybe as a way for programmers to avoid learning to draw

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:06.460
or hiring artists. In time many of these differentiators would become less clear

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.620
as the borders between PC and console would gradually erode

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.900
with Japanese role-playing games being an obvious example of

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:18.300
cross-pollination but this process occurred slowly

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.420
and many of these same differences between computer games

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:25.980
and their console cousins are still evident today.

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:29.820
Still as the 80s evolved so too did the home computer

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:34.460
with systems becoming more affordable amidst rising competition.

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.660
It seems everybody is interested now in home computers

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:41.020
well so far home computers are just a fraction

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.380
a small fraction of those being sold in the United States

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.980
but because our technology is growing by leaps and bounds

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.180
computers can help us with a lot of household items

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.860
for grown-ups as well as for the kids. The next generation of computers would

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.740
include the ZX series from Sinclair, NEC's PC series,

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:05.980
the Atari 8-bit family, the BBC Micro and the Amstrad CPC.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.660
The best selling of these was the Commodore 64

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:14.620
which released just under $600 and holds the world record as the highest

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.460
selling single computer model of all time.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:21.900
At the same time as this computing heavyweight IBM

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:25.900
launched their now iconic personal computer series

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:31.580
popularizing the term PC. These came with Microsoft's DOS operating

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:36.620
system and supported open software development for the first time.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.700
Before this all home computers were incompatible systems

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.660
meaning all programs had to be ported to specific systems

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:47.420
to meet the individual hardware requirements of each one.

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:51.020
The IBM PC and its many subsequent clones

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:54.140
instead allowed software to be ported much more easily

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:58.540
which ultimately greatly benefited game development.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.980
Hardware wasn't the only thing improving in this period though.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.780
By the mid-80s PC games were also making impressive strides.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.700
1984's King Quest from Sierra showed the evolution of the graphic adventure

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:15.100
genre with an animated protagonist and interactive world.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.820
Space Sim Elite broke new ground by adding advanced 3D graphics

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:25.340
and action gameplay into an incredibly deep and open space sandbox.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:29.420
Ultima 4 in 1985 set a new standard for role-playing games

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.860
by moving them beyond their established dungeon crawler formula

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.940
with a more expansive world, a richer more nuanced story

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:40.860
and a new moral choice-driven approach to game design.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:45.100
1987's Dungeon Master on the other hand evolved the dungeon crawler

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:50.300
into the realm of 3D with added real-time combat elements.

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:54.380
The 80s also saw the merging of entertainment and education

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:59.020
in several fondly remembered edutainment games.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:04.140
The 1985 version of the Oregon Trail taught children history

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:09.020
as well as the dangers of dysentery, typhoid and rivers.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:14.140
While the also released in 1985 where in the world is Carmen San Diego

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:19.020
taught geography and the dangers of art theft.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.140
Of course the Oregon Trail was also an enjoyable strategy game

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:26.460
with genuine emergent storytelling and rogue-like random generation

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:31.420
years before rogue even existed and where in the world is Carmen San Diego

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:36.540
was a very well made adventure game with strong replayability.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.220
In some ways the educational elements of such games were light

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.500
but that didn't stop them showing up in thousands of schools

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.180
tricking children into learning or tricking teachers

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:52.060
into letting children play games during school depending on your perspective.

01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:56.060
Ultimately edutainment computer games were a trend which

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:59.500
didn't really catch on but they still serve as a valuable reminder

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:03.500
of a time when gaming was in its infancy and developers were exploring

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.580
novel applications of this new exciting medium.

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:11.100
By the end of the 80s the era of bedroom coders

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:15.900
was coming to a close with husband and wife duos and pioneering teenagers

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:20.700
soon being replaced or going on to found legitimate development teams

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:26.540
with professional work environments. One such company, Electronic Arts, would

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:30.860
see a major breakthrough within 1988 John Madden Football

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.900
a game which would not only kick off one of the industry's largest sports

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:36.700
series but also showed the more mainstream direction

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:41.900
PC games were now heading in. 1988 also saw the release of

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:46.140
Pool of Radiance the first in a long line of Gold Box Dungeons and Dragons

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:49.500
RPGs where after years of video games taking

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:53.340
inspiration from D&D they were now finally starting to make that

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:57.580
relationship official. With home computers continuing to

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.260
become more affordable PC gaming ended the decade in a promising

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.540
place. Its early years should perhaps best be

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:09.100
remembered as a time of innovation and enthusiasm.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:14.060
The computer gaming market started small. Popularity was created through word of

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:18.780
mouth and sharing between friends. Creators enjoyed unprecedented levels

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:22.540
of creative freedom and monetization was often a distant

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:26.140
afterthought. Yet many of the games produced from this

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:30.300
era were just as impressive as their console and arcade rivals

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:36.060
albeit often in very different ways. Regardless the impact of these games on

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:40.380
the industry was considerable and gaming wasn't the only thing

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.140
they impacted. In a time where the personal computer

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:48.380
was a brand new invention computer games also played a significant role

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.140
in showcasing just what this new piece of technology could do

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:56.140
and in popularizing the idea that a computer could be more than just a

01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:00.460
machine for work. And so even if the history of computer

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.660
games stands somewhat separate to the rest of the industry

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:07.420
it still played a vital role and its importance would only grow

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.540
as the years went by.

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:20.300
Gaming's early years were tumultuous with lawsuits bankruptcy and corporate

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.980
takeovers coming alongside innovations and breakthroughs

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.180
all while technology progressed at breakneck speeds

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:30.220
leaving both software and hardware behind

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:35.340
after only a few years. Within this chaos the video game industry

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:40.860
rose fell rose fell and then finally rose again

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.820
and each time there was a connection to the quality of the games.

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.500
First with the novelty of Pong before the industry got smothered in an

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.260
abundance of Pong clones then with the golden age of the arcade

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.380
and Atari's move to bring that golden age to consoles

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.780
before a massive low quality cheaply produced games once more sunk Atari

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:04.780
and much of the industry with them and then finally with Nintendo

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:08.380
bringing new life to the industry with their higher standard of quality

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:13.980
and groundbreaking flagship series. The evolution of the gaming industry

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.500
wasn't exactly smooth but by the end of the 80s

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:25.420
video games had come a long way. In 1972 there was Pong. In 1989

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.340
Prince of Persia on the Apple II used rotoscoping technology to reduce

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:34.140
smooth true-to-life animations. Shadow of the Beast on the Amiga combined

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:37.100
detailed sprite work with parallax scrolling

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:40.860
to create stunning backgrounds. Final fight on arcades

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.140
up the level of detail and the amount of things on screen at once

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:48.460
to seriously impressive levels and even on consoles

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:52.540
the new generation of 16-bit systems was starting to really show what those 16

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.660
bits could do with games like Golden Axe providing much

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:58.700
better visuals than was seen in the last generation

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:03.660
and it wasn't just graphics. On the NES developers experience with

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:07.020
designing games and their familiarity with the system

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:11.820
was also showing dividends. Take the opening of the famously difficult

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:19.580
action platformer Ninja Gaiden.

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:52.700
Sound, visuals and cinematic style are all combined masterfully here to create

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:57.020
some really compelling storytelling that draws players in and contextualizes

01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:03.260
what you actually do in game and it does all this in less than a minute.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.780
Meanwhile on PC games like the City Builder

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:12.620
SimCity or God Game Populous for once more treading new ground and creating

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:17.180
new genres that challenged how people thought about video games.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:20.700
Still if you really want to see how far games have come

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:25.420
no single title illustrated it better than the latest entry in Nintendo's

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.860
most iconic series.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:33.820
Widely considered one of the greatest games ever made

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.780
and as close to perfect as a sequel can be

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:41.100
Super Mario Bros 3 is the pinnacle of the NES library

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.460
and it still holds up all these years later.

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:48.060
Where some NES sequels went in bold new directions

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:52.620
not always with the best results the third game in the Super Mario series

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:55.820
instead takes everything which worked about the first title

01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:01.580
and does it bigger and better. From the new overworld to multiple new power-ups

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:05.420
new enemies larger levels enhanced visuals an expanded moveset

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:10.540
multiplayer and a much longer runtime it was a game which did quite a bit to

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:14.220
impress but what shined brightest of all was its

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:18.460
creative level design. Every world had its own theme

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:22.540
every stage felt distinct and new things were introduced constantly

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:26.460
with the player never quite sure what to expect next.

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:29.260
Somehow in just three years since the first game

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:33.980
the team behind Super Mario Bros 3 worked out how to make the perfect 2D

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:41.020
Mario game and then they did it. Games had come a long way

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:45.180
but in the grand scheme of things they were just getting started

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:48.860
and the next decade would bring even more progress

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:53.020
more change and more drama.

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:04.300
By the start of the 90s the gaming industry was well and truly established.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:07.500
With the launch of the Game Boy Nintendo had cemented their status as the

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.940
market leader but the aging Nintendo entertainment system

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:15.420
was now facing tough competition from Sega's next generation Genesis

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:19.900
setting the stage for one of gaming's most legendary rivalries.

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.700
Meanwhile the increasing affordability of the personal computer

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.060
was making PC games a more serious part of the industry

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.900
while gaming itself was moving ever towards the mainstream

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:34.780
with bigger budgets bigger names and bigger controversies.

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:39.260
Overall though the 90s was a time of rapid technological progress.

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:43.980
A bit of a decade the 8-bit NES a third generation console

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:47.740
was the best selling on the market yet by the decades close

01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:52.300
consoles were entering their sixth generation with 128 bits of computing

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:56.620
power inside much more advanced systems. Graphics

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:59.340
would transition from 2D sprites and pixel based

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:03.020
to the brave new three-dimensional world of polygons.

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.700
Cartridges were replaced by the much higher capacity CD-ROM.

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:11.260
Multiple new genres of games emerged including the most popular of all time.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:15.100
Massive franchises were established including the most successful of all

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.780
time and game design experienced its own evolution

01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:23.500
as developers raced to keep up with the continually changing times.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:27.500
Before all this however the decade began with action

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.700
and while the fighting between consoles might be what's most remembered

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:35.180
about the 90s arcades also had some important fighting of their own to do

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:41.260
first.

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:45.980
Arcade growth came to a stop following the crash of 1983

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:49.340
but arcades still made up a large part of the market afterwards

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.940
and they still continue to offer the definitive video game experience by way

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:58.380
of graphics and immersion for those who had the quarters to play.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:02.620
By the start of the 16-bit era however their technological edge was narrowing

01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:06.460
and even arcade heavyweight sega had started to move away from marketing

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:09.980
itself as the company that brought the arcade experience home

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:14.460
due to the perception of arcades losing relevance within the industry.

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:18.300
Most people probably expected the 90s to be the decade where arcade games

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:22.300
quietly disappeared and maybe that would have happened

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:33.740
if not for the arrival of one game that changed everything.

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:37.100
Street Fighter 2 wasn't technically the first fighting game

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:42.380
but you'd be forgiven for thinking it was. Reaching arcades in 1991 it

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:46.380
represented a massive evolution from Capcom's 1987 predecessor

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:49.660
and brought many of the staples people have come to expect from the genre

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.580
including combo mechanics, precise joystick controls

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:58.620
and a focus on face-to-face player versus player action.

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.900
Before Street Fighter 2 competitive video games were about

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:05.740
high scores and so the competition was indirect

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.340
but Street Fighter 2 allowed players to go head-to-head

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:14.460
making competition more active, exciting and genuine.

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:17.660
This was a major step for gaming and paved the way for the concept of death

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:21.100
matches as well as more serious competitive tournaments

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:26.460
and games as a form of esports. For arcades though fighting games was

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:31.340
simply a match made in heaven and they instantly brought new life to the scene.

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.860
The social nature of arcades was a perfect fit for a genre that was about

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:38.940
being the best and winning in style and the popularity of Street Fighter was

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:42.380
explosive causing a significant resurgence in arcades

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:45.500
before soon going on to be one of the highest selling console games of the

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:50.940
next generation and leaving an immediate impact on pop culture.

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:53.900
Street Fighter 2 was soon met with competition itself

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:58.780
first from SNK's Fatal Fury in late 91 then from Midway's

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:03.980
infamously violent Mortal Kombat in 92 before arcades once more cemented

01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:06.620
themselves as the leaders of video game technology

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:11.260
with the cutting-edge 3D of Virtua Fighter from Sega in 93

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:15.820
and Namco's Tekken in 94 with a whole host of other smaller names

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:19.820
springing up along the way. For a time fighting games were the hottest

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:23.580
genre in gaming and they made a lot of money in the process

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:26.780
with Electronic Gaming Monthly reporting that in Japan

01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:30.780
fighting games accounted for 80% of all gaming sales

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:35.420
in 1996. Other important advancements in arcades

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:40.220
came from the move to 3D technology which preceded the jump to 3D seen in the

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:44.300
next generation of consoles and was in large part the result of a rivalry

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:49.740
between Sega and Namco. This can be seen in Virtua Fighter and Tekken

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.020
as well as a number of notable racing and light gun games

01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:59.500
including Virtua Racing, Daytona USA, Virtua Cop and House of the Dead from Sega

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:04.540
and Ridge Racer, Point Blank and Time Crisis from Namco.

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:07.980
Konami's highly original rhythm-based Dance Dance Revolution

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:13.900
in 1998 also proved highly influential. Still while arcades might have seen a

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:18.060
renaissance in the early and mid 90s this was ultimately only

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:21.740
enough to delay the inevitable and as the decade grew to a close

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:26.460
amidst a surging console market arcades once more entered into a period of

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:32.220
decline as the era of the arcade gradually came to an end.

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.300
Today arcades mostly exist as a nostalgic relic of the past

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:40.300
but their importance on gaming history was enormous.

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:44.460
For years arcades were the largest and most technologically advanced section of

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:47.980
the industry and in addition to producing many of gaming's greatest

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:52.620
titles they also left an enduring impact on gaming culture.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.060
Still while arcades might have kicked off the decade's action

01:26:56.060 --> 01:27:01.820
it would be consoles that would take the fighting to a whole other level.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:08.620
Sega Shot First

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:12.380
In addition to beating Nintendo out the gates in entering the fourth generation

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.060
Sega was also responsible for making things personal by deliberately

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:21.100
targeting Nintendo in their marketing.

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.580
Conventional wisdom might suggest that naming and by extension giving publicity

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:29.020
to your main competitor in your own marketing

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:32.540
isn't the best strategy yet conventional wisdom

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:38.220
isn't always correct. Genesis does may be the most famous gaming commercial of

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:43.020
all time and it exemplified the spirit of the fourth generation.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:46.620
Taking shots at Nintendo wasn't the only part of Sega of America's grand

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.180
strategy however they also sought to create a

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:52.860
strong library of unique games which would appeal to western audiences

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:57.740
and help make the Genesis stand out. Early examples of this can be seen with

01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:01.660
Michael Jackson's Moonwalker and several celebrity-induced sports games

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:05.420
like Joe Montana Football or Pat Riley Basketball.

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:09.020
These still didn't provide Sega with a true system salary needed though

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:13.180
and to make matters worse their head start only lasted so long

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.380
as in November of 1990 Nintendo's much anticipated 16-bit system finally

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:23.020
launched in Japan alongside the latest entry of one of gaming's now most

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:27.340
iconic series Super Mario World. In a head-to-head

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:30.540
comparison there wasn't a lot to differentiate the two competing pieces

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:33.740
of hardware. The Genesis did have an advantage in

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:37.500
pure CPU power but the Super Nintendo boasted more RAM,

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:43.020
better sound quality, more on-screen colors and more detailed sprites.

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:47.180
The systems were also similarly priced meaning it was games that would be the

01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:51.420
ultimate deciding factor and it was here that Sega was about

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:56.940
to make their most important play yet. Mario had launched Nintendo into the

01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:01.100
home console market and was seen as central to Nintendo's success

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.580
so Sega decided they needed their own Mario.

01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:09.260
Work on the character design started all the way back in 1988

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:13.580
and went through multiple revisions with Sega Japan and Sega America working

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:17.580
together and often disagreeing over the direction.

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:20.780
Central to the design was the decision to emphasize speed

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:25.260
and to appeal to Western audiences with designer Naoto Oshima

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:30.380
even going to New York to ask locals in Central Park their opinion on the design

01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:34.060
which ultimately led to a blue hedgehog by the name

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:38.540
of Sonic. The emphasis on speed carried over to game design

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:42.380
with the team wanting Sonic's default speed to be equal to Mario's running

01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:45.980
speed and for his running speed to be a great deal

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:49.820
faster. This led to many animation and frame rate

01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:52.300
problems but the team stuck with the idea

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:57.100
not wanting to compromise their desire for players to go fast.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:00.860
Levels were then designed to be large and non-linear to take advantage of the

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:04.700
main character's enhanced movement while also once again being seen as a

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.540
straight upgrade to the levels seen in Mario.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:12.380
Finally vibrant colors and a laid-back soundtrack were used to give the game a

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:16.220
strong sense of identity and in summer 1991

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:19.660
the project was complete with Sonic the Hedgehog

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:23.500
releasing worldwide about two months before the North American release of

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:30.300
the Super Nintendo and so at long last Sega had their killer app.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.820
Gotta go. Hey guy you're the first serious gamer I've seen all morning check

01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:38.060
this out brand new 16-bit Super Nintendo in Super Mario World!

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:43.020
Wow! What's this one? Oh this is a Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega Genesis.

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.940
Look at these radical colors huh? Wow Sonic's fast too.

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:50.620
Over here! I like Genesis and it costs a lot less.

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.620
Look here! I'll take Sonic and Genesis.

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:58.300
Sonic was an immediate success and with it the Genesis outsold the Super

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:02.860
Nintendo 2 to 1 in the 1991 US holiday season

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:07.980
with Sega taking a 65% share of the 16-bit market.

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:11.500
Meanwhile in Europe Sega performed even better as the Super Nintendo

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.980
wouldn't see an EU release until mid 1992.

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:19.660
This was one of the major differences between Nintendo and Sega at the time

01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:23.340
as while Sega were pioneering the idea of a global release for systems

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:27.020
and software Nintendo were by contrast much slower

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:30.860
at bringing their products to other markets. In the end

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:34.540
this paid off for Sega and allowed them to take a clear lead over their rival

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:38.940
for the very first time and this wasn't the only advantage

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:43.340
Sega now had. Their greatest weakness in the last generation

01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:46.860
third-party support would no longer be a problem after Sega

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:50.380
entered the market early and offered publishers much more favorable license

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:54.300
in terms than Nintendo. They also worked hard to stay on top of

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:59.340
hardware developments releasing the Sega CD or Mega CD in 1992

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:04.140
as an add-on for the Genesis. The Sega CD wasn't cheap and its sales

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.660
numbers were relatively modest but it did offer a more high-end

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:11.340
product to those who wanted it and the new CD technology provided much

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:14.780
greater storage capacity allowing for more detailed audio

01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:19.900
and entirely new types of games like Bose focused on full motion video.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.700
Lastly Sega also didn't slow down with their aggressive marketing.

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.220
The Sega Genesis has blast processing. Super Nintendo

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.460
doesn't. So what's blast processing do?

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:47.100
And uh what if you don't have blast processing?

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:58.540
It is debatable whether blast processing is even real

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:02.940
but one thing everyone can agree on is that the Super Nintendo

01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:07.740
doesn't have it. I mean sure technically the Super Nintendo was the more

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:11.820
advanced system but technically the Genesis did have

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:17.180
faster processing so Sega made sure that's what they focused on

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:21.980
and it worked. Still even if Nintendo didn't have blast

01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:25.020
processing there was something they did have

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:32.700
which some might even say is more important. Games. The Legend of Zelda

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.300
a link to the past released in America in 1992

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.620
and did for Zelda what Super Mario Bros 3 did for Mario.

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:45.020
As a near perfect sequel and one of the best games of the 16-bit era

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.340
a link to the past expanded the overworld, expanded links moveset,

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:52.860
expanded the dungeon design and then added an entire

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:56.460
parallel dark world for the player to travel between that was similar and

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.500
yet completely different to the world they knew.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.260
The result was a landmark action adventure game that set a standard for

01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:10.140
2D Zelda still not surpassed to this day and Nintendo didn't stop there.

01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:14.300
Sequels were expected but Nintendo had new ideas too

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:18.220
and they still had one of the best people around for the job.

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.300
Shigeru Miyamoto worked on several of the Super Nintendo's early first party

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:26.140
titles including the new futuristic racing game F-Zero

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.900
and the technologically groundbreaking rail shooter Star Fox,

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:32.780
the first Nintendo game to feature polygonal graphics

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:37.820
through the use of an additional graphics chip included in the game's cartridge.

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:42.380
Released in early 93 Star Fox went on to become one of the console's best-selling

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.100
games although it was still surpassed by another new

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:50.300
Nintendo franchise, 1992's Super Mario Kart which

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:53.820
brought Mario and friends into the world of kart racing

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:57.660
kicking off their own subgenre in the process.

01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.740
Still Nintendo weren't the only one making good games.

01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:05.260
Sega may have courted many third-party publishers but some of the most

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:10.700
important stayed loyal to Nintendo and brought a number of impressive sequels with them.

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:14.140
Square released Final Fantasy 4 known then as 2

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:19.020
outside Japan, Enix released Dragon Quest V which sold millions of copies

01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:23.820
even as a Japan-only title, Konami released Super Castlevania 4

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.940
allowing players to once more take the fight to Dracula

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:32.540
but most important of all was Capcom who were at the time holding the rights to

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.300
the hottest game in the world, Street Fighter 2.

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:39.660
And while this game would eventually find its way to both systems

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:43.580
it still came to the Super NES first giving Nintendo

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.660
a head start of more than a year on what would go on to be the best-selling

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:53.020
third-party title of the generation and with Street Fighter

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:59.420
Nintendo had the edge they needed. Holiday season 1992 and this time Nintendo

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.620
was selling more systems allowing them to climb back into first

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:07.660
place in 93. Sega weren't done yet though and the

01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:12.860
battle was about to get even messier. Wasting no time after the success of

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:17.020
their new best-selling game of all time Sega released the sequel to Sonic in late

01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:20.940
92 featuring even faster gameplay alongside

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:26.700
reoccurring series Sidekick Tales but it was their more adult titles that

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:32.700
would truly define the next year. Two major features of this era of console

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.940
warfare were the idea that Sega had the more mature system and games

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:41.740
than the family-friendly Nintendo and debates over which version of specific

01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:45.900
games were better. These days exclusives are what people

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:49.340
most remember but plenty of titles came to both systems

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:53.340
sometimes with completely different variants kicking off endless arguments

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:57.340
between fans over which system had the superior version

01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:01.500
Contra 3 Alien Wars vs Contra Hardcore

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:05.100
Super Castlevania vs Castlevania Bloodlines

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:10.060
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in Time vs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:16.060
The Hyperstone Heist and on it went. Sometimes two competing titles would be

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:19.100
pretty much identical but there were other times when there were big

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:24.860
differences and clear winners and losers. For example with Street Fighter 2

01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:29.100
the Super Nintendo was king with not only a year head start but also a more

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:33.500
suitable controller that had four face buttons alongside two shoulder buttons

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:37.900
compared to just three face buttons on the original Genesis controller.

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:42.780
Other times though the Genesis reigned supreme like with 1993's Aladdin

01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:46.380
where the Genesis version was aided by real Disney animators

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:50.540
and went on to be one of the system's best-selling games.

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:55.020
And then there was Mortal Kombat a game which combined

01:37:55.020 --> 01:38:00.060
arguments over Sega's more adult nature and arguments over which system had the

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:04.540
superior version and ended with Sega and Nintendo

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:08.220
sitting in front of a US congressional hearing on the dangers

01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:10.780
of violence in video games.

01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:17.100
Violence and violent images permeate more and more aspects of our lives

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:21.420
and I think it's time to draw the line. I know that one place

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:27.580
parents want us to draw the line is with violence in video games. The fact is that

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:32.300
a new generation of video games crosses that line containing the most

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.220
horrible depictions of graphic violence and sex

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.180
including particularly violence against women.

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:44.220
You see much like Street Fighter before it Mortal Kombat was a big success

01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:49.420
but its graphic depictions of violence and brutal post-victory fatalities

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:54.140
attracted more attention than from just players kicking off a media frenzy

01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:58.860
and national conversation on the role of violence in video games.

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:02.220
When Mortal Kombat made its way from arcades to consoles

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:06.060
Nintendo opted to tone down the violence by removing the blood effects

01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:09.980
but Sega instead left them in as an unlockable option

01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:13.420
making the Genesis version the most desirable.

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:16.060
Knowing that controversy might be on its way

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:20.220
Sega created their own internal rating system ahead of Mortal Kombat's console

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.180
release but this didn't prove to be enough

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:27.820
and by the end of 1993 the national conversation on video game violence

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:31.980
had reached US Congress with both Sega and Nintendo

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:35.420
being called up to answer some difficult questions.

01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:38.780
A number of advocacy groups and senators spoke on the issue

01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:42.860
presenting a united front while focusing heavily on Mortal Kombat

01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:46.780
and the strange Sega CD-FMB game Night Trap

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:50.300
and claiming that there had been a systemic failure of the gaming industry

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:55.500
to police itself. When it came to those speaking in favor of the gaming industry

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.260
however those present were anything but united

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.980
with Nintendo getting the chance to speak first

01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:07.740
and wasting no time in putting the blame squarely on Sega's lack of internal policy.

01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:12.700
In the past years some very violent and offensive games have reached the market

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:16.300
and of course I'm speaking about Mortal Kombat and Night Trap

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:21.260
and let me say that for the record I want to state that Night Trap will never

01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:26.700
appear on a Nintendo system. Obviously it would not pass our guidelines.

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:32.940
This game which as you've indicated promotes violence against women

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:37.420
simply has no place in our society. Meanwhile Sega began by defending

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:41.260
itself in the way that Sega fans at the time defended their favorite gaming

01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:46.140
system on school playgrounds i.e. by reminding those in attendance

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:50.700
that the Genesis unlike its competition wasn't made for kids.

01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:54.620
In recent days the glare of the media spotlight on this issue

01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:59.900
has resulted in the circulation of a number of distorted and inaccurate claims.

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:02.860
The most damaging of these distortions in my view

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:07.900
is the notion that Sega are only in the business of selling games to children.

01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:12.220
This is not the case. Sega also highlighted their new rating system

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:16.380
but this received a lot of pushback including from Nintendo's representative

01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:19.500
who seemed much more interested in attacking Sega

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:23.340
than defending the gaming industry. Let me make it just a couple of other

01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:27.420
points. I can't sit here and allow you to be told

01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:31.980
that somehow the video game business has been transformed today

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:36.860
from children to adults. It hasn't been and Mr. White who is a former Nintendo

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:39.900
employee knows the demographics as well as I do.

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:44.620
Furthermore I can't let you sit here and by this nonsense that this

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:49.900
Sega Night Trap game was somehow only meant for adults. The fact of the

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:53.420
matter is this is a copy of the packaging.

01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:57.660
There was no rating on this game at all when the game was introduced.

01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:01.900
Small children bought this at Toys R Us and he knows that as well as I do.

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:05.660
Ultimately the senators seemed unimpressed by gaming's great console war

01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:09.660
and decided to treat Sega and Nintendo in much the same way that a teacher

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:14.700
might treat two squabbling children. By giving them both a slap on the wrist

01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:19.180
and telling them they better start working together to make things right.

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:23.420
So gaming's fiercest rivals came together with other representatives from

01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:26.540
the industry to create the Interactive Digital

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:29.900
Software Association which soon led to the creation of the

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:35.900
Entertainment Software Rating Board or ESRB who would produce a unified set of

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.820
age ratings for all commercial video games that retailers would then opt into

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.380
enforcing. Something that has since become common

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:46.140
practice across many different regions.

01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:49.500
In the congressional hearing Sega came under the heaviest attack

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:53.020
and following public outcry many retailers pulled the controversial

01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:58.140
night trap from their shelves. However when it came to actual video game

01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:02.460
players this didn't seem to damage Sega's reputation at all

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:08.700
and instead helped cement their status as the cooler more mature gaming company

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:15.740
ultimately leading to sales going up. Holiday season 1993 and Sega came out

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:22.220
on top retaking the overall lead in 94 with 55 percent of the market.

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:27.020
By 1994 Sega and Nintendo weren't the only ones dealing with controversy

01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:30.220
though as in the world of the personal computer

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:33.740
another violent video game was exploding in popularity

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:38.460
and leaving its own mark on gaming history.

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:45.980
In the early 90s consoles might have received the most attention

01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:49.420
and made the most money but PC was still the place to be

01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:53.420
the innovation and it saw a number of big releases of its own.

01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:57.660
LucasArts 1990 pirate themed The Secret of Monkey Island

01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:01.180
set a new standard for the graphical adventure genre with its user-friendly

01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:05.740
interface sharp comedic writing and a more open game design but removed any

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:09.500
sort of fail state and ensured players could never be locked out of puzzles or

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:13.900
the means to progress the game. In 1991 Sidmir's

01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:17.980
civilization popularized the 4x genre of strategy games

01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:23.340
where you explored expanded exploited and exterminated your opposition

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:27.500
while guiding a human civilization over the course of several millennia

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:30.700
a concept that proved as expansive and original

01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:35.340
as it was addictive. Delphine software's strikingly cinematic

01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:38.540
action adventure game Another World also released that year

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:41.740
leaving a lasting impression on many who played it.

01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:45.500
Featuring a scientist fighting for survival on an alien planet

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.940
it placed a heavy emphasis on presentation and told its story

01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:53.100
entirely without dialogue creating a game that felt years ahead of its time

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:56.300
and would influence a number of important future titles including

01:44:56.300 --> 01:45:03.020
Ico, Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill. In 1992 Westwood Studios created the

01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:07.740
first real-time strategy game with Dune 2 combining resource gathering

01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:12.780
base building and small-scale warfare into an addictive new formula.

01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:16.700
Dune 2 would be followed by Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft Orcs and

01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:20.380
Humans in 1994 and Westwood's Alternative History

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:25.180
Command and Conquer in 1995 which together established the RTS as an

01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:29.980
important genre within gaming. 92 also saw the birth of the survival

01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:33.580
horror genre with infograms alone in the dark.

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:36.780
A game that went beyond embracing horror as an aesthetic

01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:39.980
by deliberately disempowering the player to heighten the tension

01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:44.860
and create a sense of dread. Its haunted mansion setting and cinematic

01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:49.740
camera would also greatly influence future titles of the genre.

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:53.900
Meanwhile in the world of role-playing games the Ultima series continued strongly

01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:57.740
with its highly acclaimed seventh entry The Black Gate

01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.260
but it was a spin-off from the main series that proved to be the most

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:06.300
innovative RPG that year. Looking Glass Studios Ultima Underworld

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:10.060
was the first role-playing game to feature first-person action in a 3D

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:14.060
environment. Described as a dungeon simulation by its

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.780
creators, Ultima Underworld combined the dungeon

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.540
crawling of genre grandfathers like Wizardry with cutting-edge action

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:24.540
gameplay and environmental design to create a brand new type of action

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:28.780
RPG that would pave the way for the immersive sim genre and many future

01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:33.180
titles. 1993 also saw the release of the visually

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:36.780
stunning graphic adventure game Mist from Cyan Inc.

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:40.620
which took full advantage of the vastly expanded storage capacity

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:46.300
of Benoo CD-ROM to create its iconic picturesque 3D island while helping to

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:50.860
popularize the adoption of CD drivers in the process.

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:55.900
Mist's puzzle-solving gameplay was quite slow but its graphics were far beyond

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:59.580
anything else at the time leading it to become one of the best-selling PC

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:05.740
games of all time. Finally in 1994, Mythos Games sci-fi

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:09.820
strategy game XCOM UFO Defense combined turn-based tactical

01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:13.740
battles with real-time management to create a surprisingly deep

01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:17.900
earth defense simulation unlike any other game before it.

01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:21.500
While Origin System's ambitious latest entry into the Space Combat

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:25.580
Wing Commander series included extensive live action FMV cutscenes

01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:29.820
that featured big Hollywood names like Mark Hamill and Malcolm McDowell

01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:34.220
represent in a major step of PC gaming towards the mainstream.

01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:38.220
Still as important as each of these games were none of them are what the early

01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:42.540
90s are best remembered for. For that we need to go back to the start

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.260
of the decade where a small group of 20-something year old

01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:49.500
developers were working for software company Softisk in an office

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:53.420
in Shreveport, Louisiana. It was here that 20-year-old

01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:57.340
university dropout John Carmack was thinking about a well-known problem

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:02.060
in PC game development. How to achieve side-scrolling graphics

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:06.300
on a computer. You see while computers were powerful

01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:09.500
in certain ways they weren't designed specifically for gaming

01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:12.780
meaning there were some things consoles were just better at

01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:18.300
like allowing for faster refresh rates. This meant PC struggled to redraw an

01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:22.780
entire screen at the same speed as a console making the iconic side-scrolling

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.420
seen in so many of the most popular video games

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:32.460
impossible until Carmack had an idea why redraw everything on screen

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:37.260
when you could instead only redraw the parts that actually change.

01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:41.340
This became known as adaptive tile refresh and with it

01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:45.900
Carmack was about to change the world of PC gaming.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:49.260
First Carmack and friends recreated Super Mario Bros 3

01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:52.460
step by step something people thought couldn't be done

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:56.140
on PC. They then sent the end result to Nintendo

01:48:56.140 --> 01:49:00.380
who were admittedly impressed but told them they didn't want Nintendo games

01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:04.620
on anything except Nintendo hardware meaning all their hard work

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:09.900
had been for nothing. So next they decided to make their own

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:13.740
game instead. With no corporate backing or funding

01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:17.180
they decided to team up with shareware distributor Apogee Software

01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:21.580
to create the side-scrolling platformer Commander Keen.

01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:25.740
It was completed in just a few months and saw great success through the shareware

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.260
model. Then once the first royalty check arrived

01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:33.420
John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack and Tom Hall

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:37.500
decided to quit their jobs at Softisk to found their own company

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:41.500
id Software. Carmack soon turned his attention to

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:45.740
gaming's new frontier 3D and once more encountered a similar

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:48.700
problem to before which was that computers of the time

01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:53.660
were just too slow to allow for fast action in 3D environments.

01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:57.020
id Software continued to create more shareware distributor games

01:49:57.020 --> 01:50:01.580
while experimenting with 3D which allowed Carmack to iterate on his new 3D

01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:04.780
engine by restricting the viewpoint to increase speed

01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:09.260
using sprites and texture mapping to save space and so on.

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:15.660
The end result was Wolfenstein 3D which released in summer 1992 and allowed

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.860
players to mow down hordes of Nazis from a first person

01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:24.620
perspective in 3D environments. Wolfenstein was the first true first

01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:28.460
person shooter and its fast pace and smooth action

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:32.380
made it hugely successful but it would soon be overshadowed

01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:36.780
by an even more impressive game.

01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:45.100
Released in late 1993 Doom was a game which changed gaming.

01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:49.340
Bigger, faster and more violent than Wolfenstein with visuals that looked years

01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:53.500
ahead of its predecessor Doom was an instant classic.

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:58.300
For years there was no FPS genre there were only Doom clones.

01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:01.580
It invented the deathmatch while helping to pioneer the concept of networked

01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:04.300
multiplayer. It spawned one of the most active mod

01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:07.980
scenes of all time while greatly popularizing the concept of modding

01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:13.100
and it was estimated that by late 1995 it was installed on more computers

01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:18.140
worldwide than Microsoft's latest Windows operating system.

01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:22.300
Doom was a gaming phenomenon and it only achieved that level of success

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:26.780
because underneath its demon-infested exterior and innovative technology

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:31.180
was a really well made game that used fast action

01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:34.780
varied enemy encounters and complex level design full of secrets

01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:39.100
to create a formula that still holds up all these years later.

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:42.940
Doom also served as a perfect representation of what made PC gaming

01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:47.820
so different to consoles in the early 90s. While Sega was desperately trying to

01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:51.020
market itself as the mature alternative to Nintendo

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:54.540
games like Doom were providing a genuine mature alternative

01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:59.020
without even really meaning to and while consoles were embroiled in a clash

01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:02.940
of corporate giants and spending tens of millions on marketing every year

01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:06.380
Doom was self-published, distributed through shareware

01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:10.620
and made by initially just five guys with two more coming on to help near the

01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:14.380
end. And despite this humble background

01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:19.020
it was still the most impressive 3d game the industry had ever seen

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.940
and it helped to create the most successful genre in gaming.

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:26.380
There have been independent games that have been phenomenally successful since

01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:29.900
Doom but it is truly rare for an independent game

01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:33.340
to be so successful while also being technologically

01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:37.260
years ahead of its competition. The shareware distribution model can

01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:40.940
also be seen as a forerunner to digital distribution.

01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:44.860
It worked by offering part of the game as a free trial that anyone could download

01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:49.100
and play and then asking players to pay to purchase the rest.

01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:53.740
With no retailer or possibly publisher it meant games sold this way had much more

01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:56.620
limited reach but the lack of any middlemen also

01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:01.900
meant lower prices for consumers and a larger cut of revenue for the developer.

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.820
And so it should come as no surprise then but Doom's success

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:09.420
quickly turned its creators into multi-millionaires.

01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:12.860
Six months after Doom's release John Carmack owned two

01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:17.500
Ferraris. He was 23 years old at the time.

01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:21.260
Its software would follow Doom with a sequel in 1994

01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:25.180
before creating an even more powerful engine to reduce their fully 3d Doom

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:29.900
successor Quake in 1996 which took multiplayer to

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:33.900
soaring new heights with far more modes and built in 16 player

01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:38.540
online capability. Quake was another big hit and with it

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:42.700
the era of online first-person shooter domination had arrived.

01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:47.100
But for consoles the mid 90s would also bring the next generation of systems

01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:52.780
and it didn't exactly play out as most people expected.

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:02.460
1994 was a big year for the gaming industry but its start was still dominated

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:06.380
by the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo and the fallout from the

01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:11.020
violent video game debate. Sega had now edged back into the lead

01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:14.860
and this period would see several of the Genesis best exclusive titles

01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:17.740
such as the beat em up classic Streets of Rage 2,

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:20.620
the side-scrolling platformer Rocket Knight Adventure

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:24.940
and the action-packed running and gunning Gunstar Heroes.

01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:29.420
1994 would also see the release of not one but two new entries into Sega's

01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:33.420
hottest series after Sonic 3 became so large during development

01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:37.100
that it could no longer fit into a single cartridge causing it to be split

01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:41.660
into Sonic 3 and the separate Sonic and Knuckles.

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:47.740
Nintendo had plenty of games of their own however. 1993's Super Mario All-Stars

01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:52.860
remade the first three entries into the Super Mario Bros series with Super Nintendo level graphics

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:56.460
and is noticeable as not only one of the system's best-selling titles

01:54:56.460 --> 01:55:00.460
but also one of the first examples of a massively successful video game remake.

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:06.540
In 1994 Nintendo would raise one of the Super Nintendo's most highly acclaimed titles with

01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:10.140
Super Metroid which upgraded the formula of the original game

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:13.980
while retaining its rich sci-fi atmosphere and focus on exploration.

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:19.340
Still, Nintendo's biggest game that year came at the hands of another developer.

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.460
Due to concerns about falling behind Sega, Nintendo began looking for other studios

01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:28.620
to bring on board, leading them to approach the UK-based Studio Rare

01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:31.980
who had impressed them with their latest 3D model rendering technology.

01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:37.020
Nintendo suggested they use these pre-rendered graphics to make a platformer

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:40.860
and gave them permission to use one of their oldest IPs to do it.

01:55:41.180 --> 01:56:10.140
Even before Donkey Kong Country released in late 1994,

01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:12.940
its unique visual style brought it a lot of attention

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:16.540
and convinced Nintendo to heavily back it with a generous marketing campaign.

01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:23.180
Even so, the game still exceeded expectations, setting the record for the fastest-selling game

01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:26.940
of all time and going on to become the third best-selling game on the system.

01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:33.420
It also wowed critics, impressing with its creative level design and timeless soundtrack

01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.100
in addition to the striking visuals.

01:56:36.060 --> 01:56:40.460
Donkey Kong Country was the edge Nintendo needed to pull back into the lead

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:45.660
following a strong holiday season in 1994, but while high-quality new titles

01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:48.380
ensured the Super Nintendo was still going strong,

01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:52.460
by this point Sega was starting to turn their attention to future systems.

01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:57.340
The fifth console generation started early and saw heavy competition.

01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:03.580
The 3DO released in America in late 1993 and boasted some seriously impressive technical

01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:08.620
specifications, becoming the first system to fully take advantage of new CD-ROM technology.

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:17.980
It also launched with a retail price of $700, which is $1,400 after inflation and struggled

01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:23.020
to build a library of solid exclusives, meaning it ultimately struggled to compete with later,

01:57:23.020 --> 01:57:25.660
better-known systems despite its strong launch.

01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:32.940
And as for those later systems, two would go head-to-head in Japan in late 1994,

01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:36.540
but this time, Nintendo wouldn't be one of them.

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:42.220
Sega began work on the next system early after realizing the importance of CD-ROMs

01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:45.420
and having had promising results with 3D technology in arcades.

01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:51.260
At the same time as this, they tried to maintain support for the Genesis by creating a second add-on

01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:57.500
in addition to the Sega CD called the 32X that would bridge the gap between the two generations

01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:00.300
and offer a cheaper entry into the 32-bit era.

01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:06.380
Unfortunately, Sega struggled to produce enough games for either the Sega CD or the 32X to

01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:11.660
really justify their high costs, meaning both pieces of hardware ended up as commercial failures

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:16.140
and might have damaged Sega's reputation with fans who did buy these add-ons due to their

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:22.140
perceived lack of support. Still, it was the next generation where the battle would truly be decided

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:27.260
and so Sega went all out on developing a new system that could meet their lofty expectations.

01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:32.220
While Sega was working on a 32-bit system of their own, however, a new entrant into the

01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:37.500
video game scene was doing the same and getting ready to change the console landscape forever more.

01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:43.580
Sony was an electronics company founded after World War II and best known for their music

01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:49.900
products like the Sony Walkman. Their first foray into gaming hadn't turned out very well.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:55.340
A joint venture with Nintendo led to them producing the sound chip used in the Super Nintendo,

01:58:55.660 --> 01:59:02.140
but they also worked with Nintendo on a CD-ROM add-on for the system. Before it could be completed,

01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:07.580
however, Nintendo got cold feet over how much control the terms of the deal gave Sony and instead

01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:14.300
went to negotiate a more favorable deal with Sony's main rival, Philips. Not knowing this,

01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:19.980
Sony went on to announce their Super Nintendo add-on at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1991.

01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:26.860
It was called the PlayStation, and the very next day, Nintendo got up on stage themselves

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:32.540
and announced their new partnership with Philips, declaring the PlayStation dead in the process.

01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:38.860
For Sony, this was a serious blow and an even more serious betrayal,

01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:42.300
something not taken lightly in Japan's honor-based business culture.

01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:47.820
They responded by severing all ties with Nintendo, with many executives at Sony wanting

01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:52.140
to end all activity connected to the gaming industry, which they had come to view as too

01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:57.180
close to the toy industry to fit with Sony's established brand, in addition to being apparently

01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:03.180
highly unreliable. Ken Kutaragi, the man in charge of the PlayStation's development,

02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:09.340
wanted the opposite, however. Kutaragi was confident in his technology and proposed Sony

02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:14.060
go it alone and create a standalone console, while using the company's poor treatment from

02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:17.820
Nintendo to support his argument for why they shouldn't give up on the idea.

02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:25.980
In the end, Kutaragi got his way, but he still had a problem. Not only was developing their own

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:31.020
system considerably risky, but Sony also had no actual experience in game development.

02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:37.020
In the past, consoles had lived and died on the strength of their first party support,

02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:42.940
which for Sony didn't even exist. So, not knowing anything about game development,

02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:47.420
the team decided to stick with what they did know, hardware and business.

02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:53.660
To this end, they designed the system from the ground up with a focus on 3D polygon graphics

02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:57.100
and also set out to secure their desperately needed third party support.

02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:02.540
To do this, they formed partnerships with established Japanese developers like Namco and

02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:08.140
Konami, while purchasing the UK-based Cygnosis, who were best known for their widely popular puzzle

02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:15.180
game Lemmings. This gave Sony their first in-house team, and it was through this that they would

02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:21.100
stumble into their big break. Developers at Cygnosis found the current workstation-based

02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:26.460
development kits to be overly expensive and impractical, and so they persuaded Sony to

02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:31.740
instead use a PC-based development system, thus marking a major turning point for the

02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:35.420
console industry, which had largely ignored PCs until then.

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:42.300
PC-based development was not only cheaper and more efficient, it also streamlined the process

02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:48.300
for third parties, while making porting games between PC and Sony's new system much easier

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:54.140
than before, something which proved crucial in allowing Sony to compete with their more established

02:01:54.140 --> 02:02:00.060
rivals. As the console neared completion, Sony decided to break from the tradition of using

02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:04.460
the company's name in the title of the system due to upper management's fear that failure could

02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:11.980
damage the company's brand, and so the console would keep its original name. And in December 1994,

02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:17.580
the PlayStation launched in Japan, just one week after release of another new console,

02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:19.100
the Sega Saturn.

02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:48.140
The two systems were similarly priced,

02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:52.700
and offered similar performance, but it was Sega who proved to be the early favorite,

02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:57.500
thanks in large part to the hugely popular Virtua Fighter, which sold at a near one-to-one

02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:03.820
ratio with the Saturn at release. For the PlayStation, it was Sega's big arcade rival Namco

02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:08.380
that would be the console's most important developer in its first year, with Ridge Racer

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:13.020
proving the most successful launch title and Tekken soon following to give the PlayStation

02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:19.260
a 3D fighting game of its own. Still, exclusives wouldn't be the most important factor in the

02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:25.900
new system's first years. As both systems prepared for their global release, both companies came up

02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:31.180
with a plan to give them the edge over the other, which they would reveal at the first-ever Electronic

02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:38.220
Entertainment Expo in 1995, where 40,000 eager attendees packed the Los Angeles Convention Center

02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:44.540
to get a glimpse of the next generation of gaming. Sega went first and took to the stage

02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:51.100
to announce that, due to high consumer demand, the Saturn would release immediately, that very day,

02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:56.700
at select retailers. This was four months before the expected September release date,

02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:02.540
and Sega hoped this headstart would give them the advantage. Unfortunately for them, however,

02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:07.100
other retailers responded to this surprise announcement very negatively, with KB toys

02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:12.460
even dropping Sega from its lineup, and the early release also left the Saturn's launch lineup

02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:19.020
rather light on games. Things quickly went from bad to worse, though, because Sony followed with

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:24.780
a surprise announcement of their own, which came when SCE President of America, Steve Race, took

02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:28.940
to the stage to give one of gaming's all-time greatest speeches.

02:04:55.100 --> 02:05:06.540
$299 was $100 less than the Saturn, meaning the systems were no longer similarly priced,

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:11.820
and it turned out that while Sega's gamble backfired, Sony's instead paid off.

02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:19.500
The PlayStation released on the 9th of September 1995. Two days later, it had sold more units than

02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:25.420
the Saturn had in the last four months. The PlayStation's launch was huge, and what's more,

02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:30.380
their easier-to-develop for system was about to start proving its worth, as a number of former

02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:37.180
PC developers soon started releasing games for Sony's new console. Notable examples include

02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:43.660
Platformer Rayman from Ubisoft in 95, Naughty Dog's soon-to-be-iconic Crash Bandicoot in 96,

02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:48.380
which gave the PlayStation its first real mascot, and Tomb Raider from Core Design,

02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:52.940
a graphically impressive action-adventure game featuring one of gaming's most recognisable

02:05:52.940 --> 02:06:00.060
female leads. 96 also saw the release of another landmark PlayStation title from Capcom with

02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:05.020
Resident Evil, which may be the single most influential survival horror game of all time.

02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:10.460
All of these titles were big commercial hits, with Resident Evil, Crash Bandicoot,

02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:13.980
and Tomb Raider each going on to sell over 5 million copies.

02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:20.300
The Saturn did have games of its own, with several high-quality arcade ports, alongside some strong

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:27.100
new first-party titles like Night's Into Dreams and Panzer Jagoons. Sony, however, increasingly

02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:32.300
seemed to have the rest of the gaming industry on their side, and in time, Sony's initial victory

02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:38.060
would turn into a slaughter. For years, Sega tried to set themselves apart from Nintendo

02:06:38.060 --> 02:06:43.180
by appealing to an older demographic and marketing their system as the more mature option,

02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:47.420
but now Sony was doing the same, and beating Sega at their own game.

02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:53.660
In 96, Sega responded to the growing pressure with the release of the Saturn Model 2,

02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:58.780
which aimed to lower the retail price and cost of manufacturing. Sony, however,

02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:05.740
replied by cutting the price of the PlayStation to $199, ensuring their lead just kept growing.

02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:11.980
For Sega, the situation was starting to look desperate, and the competition would only increase

02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:15.660
as an old friend of theirs would soon release a console of their own.

02:07:17.180 --> 02:07:21.900
While the fifth console generation was getting off to an explosive start, Nintendo were quietly

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:27.260
enjoying the Super Nintendo's finest years. After a drawn-out and tightly fought competition

02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:32.220
with the Genesis, where Sega had often come out on top, in its later years, the supply of

02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:38.140
new Genesis games slowed up, allowing Nintendo to finally pull comfortably ahead in a 16-bit market

02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:44.940
that was still going surprisingly strong. This may have been partly because 1995-96

02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:51.100
saw some of the Super Nintendo's best games. Super Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island, saw Mario

02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:57.100
return with a stunning new art style and fresh Yoshi-focused gameplay. Rare followed up the

02:07:57.100 --> 02:08:03.100
monstrously successful Donkey Kong Country with not one, but two more sequels that almost matched

02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:08.940
the first in sales. And RPG fans were spoiled for choice, with the cult classic Earthbound's

02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:14.220
idiosyncratic take on modern America offering a setting unlike anything players had seen before,

02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:20.140
Square and Nintendo's collaborative Super Mario RPG offering a Mario game unlike anything

02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:26.140
players had seen before, and Final Fantasy's latest entry, 6 or 3 depending on region,

02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:29.980
providing the series' highest rated and best-selling title to date.

02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:35.820
Lastly, there was also Chrono Trigger, which was developed by a dream team that included

02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:40.620
the creator of the Final Fantasy series, the creator of the Dragon Quest series, and the creator of

02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:46.300
the Dragon Ball Manga. Chrono Trigger featured a time-travelling adventure with multiple endings,

02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:52.380
lots of reactivity, and some of the best visuals and music of a 16-bit era, and it's often considered

02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:59.180
to be one of the best JRPGs of all time. Still, as strong as the Super Nintendo's last years were,

02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:04.060
nothing can last forever, at least not in the always-evolving gaming industry,

02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:09.820
and development of Nintendo's next console started as far back as early 1993.

02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:16.140
After their development of a CD-based system failed to work out with either Sony or Philips,

02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:20.060
Nintendo formed a new partnership with Silicon Graphics to bring their powerful

02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:26.940
supercomputer technology to the world of consoles. The final product released in 1996,

02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:35.180
with the name Nintendo 64 to emphasize its 64 bits of computing. But as powerful as Nintendo's

02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:40.860
new system might have been, it was about to face heavy competition, and its main rival had a head

02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:54.300
start alongside one other key advantage. Nintendo arrived late, but the N64 did have some things

02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:59.580
in its favor. Nintendo's continued focus on affordability meant the system was able to match

02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:04.060
for new prices of Saturn and PlayStation, while offering much more powerful hardware.

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:10.300
We've doubled the PlayStation's RAM at three times faster CPU, and a much higher polygon count

02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:14.540
that 3D graphics of the N64 were simply a step above any of their competitors.

02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:20.060
Nintendo also innovated with their controller by adding a thumb-controlled analog stick,

02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:25.900
reminiscent of the joysticks of older gaming systems. The overall design might seem clunky by

02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:30.460
today's standards, but it was an important step for the time, and analog controls greatly

02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:36.700
complemented the move to 3D. The N64 also came with four controller ports, which was two more

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:42.940
than its rivals, and made it a great system for multiplayer games. Nintendo's launch lineup

02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:48.220
initially looked less promising, with only two games available for the North American release.

02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:55.020
This lack of games was what delayed the release to 1996, and for most consoles, two titles would

02:10:55.020 --> 02:11:01.180
never be enough. Luckily for Nintendo, however, one of those games was capable of doing some rather

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.380
heavy lifting.

02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:34.460
Super Mario 64 didn't just bring Nintendo's popular mascot into the realm of 3D, it also

02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:39.980
shattered expectations for what a 3D platformer could be. Before it, games of the genre had

02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:46.780
used fixed cameras, or just suffered from loose, imprecise controls. But using the new analog stick,

02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:52.460
Mario was given full 360-degree movement with a detached adjustable camera and a rich array of

02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:58.620
movement options. Levels were big and inviting, begging players to explore and experiment,

02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:04.300
and the cartoony visual style was a great fit for showcasing the N64's high polygon count.

02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:12.060
Basically, it was as strong a launch title as Nintendo could have asked for, but it still

02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:19.340
wouldn't be enough. Because as impressive as the N64 and Mario were, there was one thing the

02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:27.580
PlayStation did, which Nintendo didn't. And that was used CDs. Nintendo's console was more

02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:34.300
powerful. It did have a higher polygon count and shorter load times, but CDs had higher capacity,

02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.980
and for many developers, this was the most important factor. The best known example of this

02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:45.340
was RPG Veteran Square, who had been a loyal ally to Nintendo and had originally begun work on

02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:50.940
their next Final Fantasy game on the Super Nintendo. As development progressed, Square soon

02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:55.020
realised they wanted to use pre-rendered video and backgrounds, something that would only be

02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:59.260
possible with the larger capacity of the CD, meaning creating the game for Nintendo's new

02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:05.340
console was no longer possible. As development continued, Square invested more and more resources

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:10.140
into the project, resulting in an estimated development budget of more than $14 million,

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:17.420
making it the most expensive game ever made at the time, and it turned out, Square's investment

02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:19.500
paid off.

02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:57.420
Final Fantasy VII released in 1997, and was unbelievably successful. Its use of full-motion

02:13:57.420 --> 02:14:02.780
video and pre-rendered CG gave it a cinematic style which wowed audiences and critics alike.

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:08.540
Its setting and characters felt fresh and exciting in an era years before anime had found

02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:13.980
mainstream popularity, and when most Japanese RPGs still didn't even get released outside Japan,

02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:18.540
and its story and sense of adventure resonated with players at the time

02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:24.860
in a way that few other games ever had. Final Fantasy VII sold over 10 million copies,

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:28.460
eventually going on to become the PlayStation's joint best-selling game of all time.

02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:34.780
For Sony, it was the PlayStation's killer app, and they didn't even need to do anything to get it.

02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:41.260
The higher capacity of CDs allowed for the use of FMV, as well as higher quality sound,

02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:48.300
and even more realistic and detailed textures. And so, the N64 was the more powerful system,

02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:54.380
in all ways except for the one which mattered the most. Nintendo weren't out of the competition

02:14:54.380 --> 02:15:00.140
yet though, because there was something they could do which Sony couldn't. Make their own games.

02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:06.700
The N64 couldn't match the PlayStation's early sales, but it still got off to a solid start,

02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:11.580
thanks in large part to Nintendo's strong pre-established reputation, and more games

02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:20.780
were soon on the way. At the end of 1996, Mario 64 was joined by Mario Kart 64, bringing kart racing

02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:27.180
to the third dimension, and giving the system its second best-selling game. In 97, Nintendo continued

02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:33.580
venue naming convention with the well-received Star Fox 64, and gave Mario Sidekick Yoshi

02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:40.300
his own standalone title with Yoshi's Story. They also received invaluable support from the then

02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:46.460
second-party developer Rare, who were about to give the console one of the era's most iconic games.

02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:22.460
Goldeneye 007 single-handedly proved that first-person shooters could work on consoles,

02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:28.540
and they could work well. Taking inspiration from Doom, but opting for a more realistic approach,

02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:33.100
Goldeneye featured a memorable single-player campaign that did an admirable job of providing a

02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:38.860
James Bond-like experience, complete with a rich story, varied levels and stealth elements,

02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:44.380
but it was multiplayer that the game is best remembered for. By bringing the fun of the

02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:49.740
deathmatch to consoles, Goldeneye proved to be a massive success, and went on to sell over 8

02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:56.380
million copies, putting it only behind Mario 64 and Mario Kart as the system's best-selling game.

02:16:56.780 --> 02:17:03.420
And the hits from Rare didn't stop at Goldeneye. They also gave the system a second popular

02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:08.220
kart racer with Diddy Kong Racing, before kicking off a new critically-acclaimed platforming series

02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:14.700
with Banjo-Kazooie, before following this with Donkey Kong's successful 3D debut in Donkey Kong 64,

02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:20.300
and finally by providing worthy successors to both Goldeneye and Banjo-Kazooie in 2000

02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:25.900
with Perfect Dark and Banjo 2e. Nintendo also had more important games of their own,

02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:29.820
with two in particular going on to help define the fifth console generation.

02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:35.420
The first would see the return of Nintendo's other flagship series and produced what may be

02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:41.260
the most critically-acclaimed game of all time. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:47.740
released in late 1998 and made the transition to 3D while retaining the series' focus on exploration

02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:54.460
and adventure. With intuitive combat, intricate dungeon design and a huge world full of secrets,

02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:59.580
Ocarina of Time was a staggeringly well-made game, but what truly elevated it to one of

02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:06.540
gaming's all-time greats was its sense of atmosphere and weight. At times, dark, somber,

02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:11.900
and even surreal, Link's quest to the feet Ganondorf felt as epic as it was enchanting,

02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:18.380
in a way rarely matched in the medium before or since. Nintendo also gave the world a new take

02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:25.580
on the fighting genre in 1999 with Super Smash Bros. Featuring an all-star cast of classic Nintendo

02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:30.860
characters, Smash moved the focus away from character-specific combos to create a more

02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:35.740
approachable but no less enjoyable fighting game that was unlike anything else on the market.

02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:41.660
Still, as impressive as Nintendo's first and second-party titles were in this period,

02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:44.540
they still weren't enough to match the PlayStation's ever-growing lineup.

02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:49.420
With so many developers favouring Sony's system because of its ease of development

02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:54.380
and the advantages of CDs, Nintendo was left with little third-party support,

02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:59.500
and the more the PlayStation user base grew, the more developers wanted their games to be on it.

02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:05.900
Sony finished the decades strongly. They took inspiration from Nintendo to produce

02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:11.260
their own dual analog controller in 1997. They transitioned their marketing from targeting

02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:16.060
Sega towards directly targeting Nintendo after Nintendo became the main competition,

02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:21.180
and with each new year they saw multiple major titles but ensured the PlayStation's dominant

02:19:21.180 --> 02:19:28.940
position grew and grew. 1997 brought well-received sequels to Tomb Raider and Crash Bandicoot,

02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:33.500
alongside the only other game that could match Final Fantasy and Sales numbers, Gran Turismo.

02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:39.420
Produced by Polyphony Digital, a new Japanese-based first-party studio within Sony,

02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:44.540
Gran Turismo received universal acclaim and set a new bar for graphics and realism in a driving

02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:49.740
game, surpassing even arcade competition in a somewhat symbolic step for the industry.

02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:57.980
In 1998, Sony's lineup was arguably even stronger, with widely successful sequels to Resident Evil,

02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:03.340
Tekken, Crash Bandicoot and Tomb Raider that would be joined by high-selling new series,

02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:08.860
like Insomniac's Spiroba Dragon. Perhaps the year's biggest surprise came from

02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:14.300
another ex-Nintendo ally when Konami released their latest entry into the Metal Gear series.

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:20.860
Much like Final Fantasy VII before it, Metal Gear Solid wowed players with its cinematic focus,

02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:27.100
this time produced through in-engine cutscenes, alongside full voice acting and an unusually

02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:33.180
mature and complicated storyline. The result was one of the most story-focused and cinematic

02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:40.300
experiences ever seen in a game, and it too would receive universal acclaim alongside 7 million copies

02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:48.460
sold. 1999 was once more a packed year with even more sequels, this time to Final Fantasy,

02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:55.180
Resident Evil, Spiro, Tomb Raider and Gran Turismo, alongside a new survival horror game from Konami

02:20:55.180 --> 02:21:00.700
in Silent Hill and a kart racer to compete with Nintendo in the form of Crash Team Racing.

02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:07.020
As the console generation progressed, the reality of the situation became clear. Sony's lineup of

02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:11.500
games was simply too strong, and it allowed the PlayStation to maintain the dominant lead on

02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:17.900
its competition from its release all the way to its discontinuation 12 years later. In the process,

02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:23.340
the PlayStation became the first console in history to surpass 100 million units sold,

02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:27.580
which was more than twice that of the previous generation's leader, the Super Nintendo,

02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:35.500
and almost 70 million more than Sony's closest competition, the N64. By contrast, the Saturn

02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:43.500
sold only 9.2 million, leaving Sega a distant third place and in serious trouble. During this

02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:47.980
period, disagreements over the company's future between the Japanese and American divisions were

02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:53.580
reported to be frequent. Ultimately, the rapidly declining profits led the company to discontinue

02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:59.260
the Saturn in 1998 in favour of focusing on the next generation, where they hoped to get a head

02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:04.620
start on the competition. Throughout the development of their next console, Sega tried to learn from

02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:09.500
their mistakes with the Saturn by paying close attention to production costs and trying to select

02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:16.060
hardware components similar to personal computers to assist software development. The system also

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:21.020
used a custom version of Windows operating system to further help with porting games between PC

02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:27.100
and was the first console to include a built-in modular modem to enable internet access and

02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:33.580
online play. In the end, the console was completed while the fifth generation was still going strong,

02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:39.420
and in November 1998, it released in Japan, with a global release coming one year later.

02:22:51.180 --> 02:23:13.020
The Dreamcast got off to a slow but steady start. Pre-orders in Japan were high,

02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:17.500
but hardware shortages meant Sega couldn't keep up with demand, meaning they failed to meet their

02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:23.180
initial sales goals. The American launch went smoother, however, and the first year sales seemed

02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:29.180
promising. The launch lineup included a number of first-party titles, but its two big early stars

02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:36.380
would be Sonic Adventures and Soul Calibur. The first represented Sonic's first true 3D debut

02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:40.540
and quickly became the system's best-selling game, while Namco's Soul Calibur was one of the

02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:45.580
most highly acclaimed fighting games of all time and is notable as being graphically superior to

02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:52.460
its arcade counterpart and showcasing just how much next-gen systems could do. Still,

02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:56.940
early sales were one thing, but the true test for Sega would be when their competition joined the

02:23:56.940 --> 02:24:03.820
sixth generation, and for that, they wouldn't need to wait long. And so, the decade came to a

02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:09.820
close where after years of intense neck-and-neck battle between Sega and Nintendo, it was Sony

02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:17.100
who ultimately came out as the winner, and they won by some way. For Nintendo, the end of the 90s

02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:22.300
weren't all bad, however, because there was one area where they remained firmly on top.

02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:34.300
The Game Boy released in 1989 and quickly surpassed its technologically superior competition.

02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:39.580
Nintendo supported their new handheld system with a number of first-party continuations of

02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:47.020
classic Nintendo series. This meant more Mario, with Super Mario Land 2 before new series antagonist

02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:54.300
Wario got his first game in Wario Land Super Mario Land 3. The Game Boy also got a sequel to Metroid,

02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:59.580
with Metroid 2 Return of Samus, as well as a new 2D Zelda with Link's Awakening.

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:06.460
Other notable early Game Boy games include Puzzle Game Dr. Mario, Kirby's First Ever Outing in

02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:11.980
Kirby's Dreamland, and a continuation of the original Donkey Kong series, as well as a portable

02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:18.540
title from Rare called Donkey Kong Land. These games were all well received and helped the Game Boy

02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:24.460
to continue strong, but it would be a new series which came to define handheld gaming in the 90s.

02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:30.300
Before that, Nintendo would release the highly experimental and rather disastrous

02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:36.380
Virtual Boy in 1995, a 32-bit technically portable headset and controller.

02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:42.140
The Virtual Boy was the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D,

02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:47.260
although it was only in red and black, and there were concerns about long-term use,

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:52.940
causing permanent eye damage. It was also pushed to market before it was truly ready

02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:58.220
and received negative reviews for its high price, uncomfortable design, and weak selection of games

02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:04.540
that struggled to use its novel 3D effect in interesting ways. Ultimately, the Virtual Boy

02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:09.900
ended as a clear failure, and was discontinued less than a year after its launch before even

02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:16.540
receiving a European release, but it was at least one of gaming's more innovative and unique failures.

02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:22.700
For Nintendo, this appointment wouldn't last long, however, because they were about to stumble

02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:26.300
onto a game that would single-handedly conquer the world.

02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:51.500
Pokemon released in 1996 in Japan, 1998 in America, and 1999 in Europe. It was inspired by creator

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:57.020
Satoshi Tajiri's childhood hobby of collecting insects, but upon hearing the idea for the game,

02:26:57.020 --> 02:27:02.860
Nintendo were initially skeptical. In the end, it was support from Shigeru Miyamoto

02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:07.740
that helped get the game off the ground, with the Game Boy's link cable enabled multiplayer

02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:12.460
acting as a major influence in creating a game focused on collecting and trading,

02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:18.460
rather than being a more traditional RPG. The idea to have different versions of the same

02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:23.580
game with exclusive Pokemon came from Miyamoto, who thought it would encourage the game's social

02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:32.060
aspects. And in the end, Miyamoto and Tajiri would be proving right, but success didn't happen overnight.

02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:38.700
After a long and problematic development, Pocket Monsters Red and Green released in

02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:44.860
Japan to decent but not remarkable sales. By the end of its first year, the game sold over

02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:50.220
1 million copies in Japan alone, but then, instead of slowing down like most releases,

02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:57.500
Pocket Monsters did the opposite. With a blue and yellow version released later to renew interest

02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:02.860
and strong word of mouth as a result of the game's social aspects, sales just continued to grow,

02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:11.020
with 3.65 million copies sold in Japan in 1997. To put this in perspective, the total lifetime

02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:17.420
sales for the Game Boy in the region at this time was only 7 million, but then Game Boy sales

02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:24.300
started to shoot up as well. By the end of a slow localization process, Nintendo and Game Freak

02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:29.980
had finally started to realize the potential value of what they had their hands on, and so they decided

02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:35.100
to increase the game's marketing, tying the game's promotion to the upcoming anime and the series

02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:43.660
mascot, Pikachu. Across America and Europe, Pokemon Red and Blue broke sales record after sales

02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:51.420
record, with 31 million copies sold worldwide, or 46 million including all versions. It was later

02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:57.180
described as the most successful video game of all time and received the world record for best

02:28:57.180 --> 02:29:03.900
selling video game excluding bundle sales. In short, Pokemon was a phenomenon unlike anything

02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:09.660
seen before in the history of gaming, and it was a phenomenon that didn't stop at the games.

02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:17.660
An anime, a card game, merchandise, accessories, movies, spinoffs, sequels and more, all in mere

02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:22.540
months as the franchise grew and grew, with children all around the world doing whatever

02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:29.100
they could to get their hands on anything and everything Pokemon. For a short period of time,

02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:33.820
the world seemed to stand still, gripped in the midst of a genuine Pokemonia.

02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:40.060
It was possibly the biggest cultural phenomenon the modern world has seen, and it's hard to

02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:47.180
think of any one thing that has matched it since. To this day, Pokemon is the highest grossing media

02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:54.300
franchise in the world, surpassing Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Marvel, and it doesn't

02:29:54.380 --> 02:30:00.140
look like anything will be catching up with it anytime soon. If there were any doubts still

02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:05.500
about the gaming industry's mainstream potential by the late 90s, they didn't survive the arrival

02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:12.700
of Pokemon, and all this, every bit of it, was kicked off on the back of one simple game.

02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:18.620
When people talk about the greatest games of all time, there are a lot of obvious choices,

02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:21.740
but Pokemon Red and Blue might be one of the most overlooked.

02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:27.580
Aimed primarily at children, with a legacy that has far outgrown the original titles,

02:30:27.580 --> 02:30:32.540
it's easy to forget how fresh and addictively enjoyable Pokemon's concept of combining role

02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:39.020
playing mechanics with monster collection truly was to players at the time. It provided a perfect

02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:44.460
introduction to the RPG genre, but it also added excitement and personality to the experience,

02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:48.060
with players feeling a strong sense of attachment to their pocket companions,

02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:51.900
and always wanting to see what new creatures awaited them in the next location,

02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:57.820
or which Pokemon might evolve next, or what secrets that might be out there in the world

02:30:57.820 --> 02:31:03.900
waiting to be uncovered. The multiplayer aspects and growth of the franchise beyond gaming then

02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:08.620
helped turn Pokemon into the unprecedented craze that it became, but that wouldn't have been

02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:14.060
possible if not for the strength of the original games, which makes them seem worthy of a special

02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:20.220
place in gaming's history. And as for the Game Boy, it soon received an updated model with the

02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:27.500
Game Boy Color, which released globally in late 1998. Its best-selling game was, unsurprisingly,

02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:31.900
the next entry into the Pokemon series, but it included full backwards compatibility with the

02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:36.940
Game Boy's existing library, allowing Game Boy Color owners to not only play their old games,

02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:43.340
but also play them in color. Amidst surging Pokemonia, the new Game Boy sold well,

02:31:43.340 --> 02:31:49.420
with combined sales with the original reaching over 118 million units, making it the fourth

02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:55.260
best-selling system of all time. It was also surprisingly long-lasting, with the Game Boy's

02:31:55.260 --> 02:32:02.380
lifespan starting in 1989 and lasting until 2003, which wasn't bad for a system that released

02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:08.940
already far behind its competition in terms of technological power. And as for that competition,

02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:15.260
by the mid-90s it barely existed, although the Japanese-only Wonderswan from Bandai did mean

02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:21.020
there was at least one other system out there at the end of the decade. Regardless, when it came

02:32:21.020 --> 02:32:27.420
to handhelds, the 90s was a period of absolute Nintendo domination, to a degree rarely seen

02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:35.020
in the industry before or since. Still, the Game Boy wasn't the only system that ended the decade well.

02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:46.140
On computers, the second half of the 90s are best remembered for the growing presence of online

02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:52.540
gaming and for the large number of critically acclaimed genre-defining titles. PC gaming experienced

02:32:52.540 --> 02:32:57.180
slower growth than consoles during this period, but the PlayStation itself marked a move towards

02:32:57.180 --> 02:33:02.220
more PC-friendly development and many of the console's best-selling games like Tomb Raider,

02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:08.220
Final Fantasy and Resident Evil were also released on Windows. The PC still had plenty

02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:12.780
of exclusives of its own though, and it still led the way in a number of key genres.

02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:19.740
1997 kicked off with Blizzard's Action RPG Diablo, which took the role-playing genre in a new

02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:26.060
direction and reached new levels of commercial success as a result. Before Diablo, computer RPGs

02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:31.180
were known for their complexity and were often seen as rather niche, but Diablo's isometric

02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:37.340
action stripped away some of the depth to instead place a heavier focus on atmosphere, combat and

02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:44.540
item progression, going on to sell over 2 million copies as a result. If action didn't appeal to

02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:51.420
you, 1997 also saw the release of a major step for more traditional RPGs with Interplay's Fallout,

02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:56.860
which featured a bleak post-apocalyptic setting and a morally ambiguous choice-driven storyline

02:33:56.860 --> 02:34:04.060
to provide a fresh take on the role-playing genre. 1997 also saw a landmark real-time strategy game

02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:08.940
with Ensemble Studios Age of Empires, which proved to be a popular historical take on the

02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:16.220
genre and featured impressive online and network play integration. Its sequel in 1999 was even

02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:22.620
more successful and has retained an active multiplayer community to this day. Growing

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:27.980
access to online connectivity also paved the way for one of the year's most important releases

02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:34.300
in Origin System's Ultima Online, which became the first game to create a multiplayer online

02:34:34.300 --> 02:34:41.660
RPG on a genuinely massive scale. Building on what was started with mods many years earlier,

02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:48.700
Ultima Online offered an open-ended player-driven experience with up to 2,500 simultaneous players

02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:54.460
in a single virtual world, which far surpassed any other game of the time and popularized the

02:34:54.460 --> 02:35:01.740
idea of the MMO. 1998 saw the focus on online gaming continue with the arrival of Blizzard's

02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:08.220
next major series. StarCraft featured a well-made campaign and a rich sci-fi setting, but what truly

02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:14.380
set it apart was the popularity of its multiplayer. Using Blizzard's integrated Battle.net service,

02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:20.540
StarCraft offered fast and efficient matchmaking and its highly distinctive yet well-balanced factions

02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:26.220
were a perfect fit for competitive multiplayer. This led to it becoming the best-selling RTS game

02:35:26.220 --> 02:35:32.700
of all time, with 11 million copies sold by 2009. It also did much to establish the modern

02:35:32.700 --> 02:35:37.740
esports scene as we know it today, particularly with its popularity in South Korea, where televised

02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:46.220
commentated tournaments began as early as December 1999. Other important games of 1998 include Grim

02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:50.700
Fandango, a highly original point-and-click adventure game from genre veteran's LucasArts,

02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:56.780
Thief the Dark Project, a first-person stealth game from Looking Glass Studios known for its

02:35:56.780 --> 02:36:02.940
immersive design and vast player freedom, and BioWare's Baldur's Gate, a fancy RPG that set a

02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:07.500
new standard for Dungeons & Dragons based video games and marked the start of a new era for the

02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:14.940
genre. 1998 would also see Valve make their gaming debut with their genre defining Half-Life.

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:21.020
With its immersive, seamless story, regular integration of puzzles,

02:36:21.020 --> 02:36:26.620
and humble, scientist protagonist, Half-Life was almost the polar opposite of Doom,

02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:30.700
and it showcased the genre's potential for storytelling while proving that first-person

02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:38.140
shooters could be much more than just Doom clones. In 1999, Ultimate Online was joined by another

02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:45.500
massive MMO by way of EverQuest from Sony Online Entertainment. EverQuest soon surpassed

02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:51.100
Ultimate Online's player count and established the formula of leveling, partying, dungeon running,

02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:55.900
and gearing that would come to define so much of the genre and would be copied by so many future

02:36:55.900 --> 02:37:02.380
games. 1999 also saw the release of Heroes of Might and Magic 3, which gave turn-based strategy

02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:06.700
fans a cult classic title but is still one of the best examples of its genre to this day.

02:37:07.660 --> 02:37:12.620
System Shock 2, which combined role-playing with first-person shooting and survival horror elements

02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:18.860
to create a sci-fi cyberpunk classic, and Planescape Torment, which gave the decade one of its most

02:37:18.860 --> 02:37:24.060
memorable RPGs while winning much praise for its mature story, intelligent writing, and thematic

02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:30.780
depth. The 90s would close out in fitting fashion, with two multiplayer-focused FPS games going head

02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:37.740
to head for the title of best online shooter. The first was Quake 3 Arena, the latest game from

02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:44.700
id Software, and the other was Unreal Tournament from Epic Games. Both games were multiplayer-only

02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:51.500
arena shooters, and both games offered impressive 3D graphics and lightning-fast action. Unreal

02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:55.820
stood out for its greater variety of guns and gamemodes, while Quake was often considered the

02:37:55.820 --> 02:38:01.020
game of choice for traditionalists, but regardless of individual allegiance, collectively the two

02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:06.220
games represented the pinnacle of arena shooters at a time when arena shooters were the undisputed

02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:12.460
kings of the FPS genre. Amongst the already mentioned games were a number of other successful

02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:18.460
series and sequels, including a number of popular simulation and strategy games. Together, these

02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:24.380
gave the PC a rather diverse lineup of games, and this was a time when PC gaming was still largely

02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:30.540
distinct from that seen on consoles. In the end, though, the 90s were the decade where PC gaming

02:38:30.540 --> 02:38:35.260
moved towards the mainstream while still managing to maintain much of what originally made it unique.

02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:39.500
From talented young developers making industry-changing breakthroughs

02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:43.580
to the long-running focus on depth and complexity in game design,

02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:47.260
or the general tendency of catering to more mature audiences.

02:38:48.540 --> 02:38:53.500
The 90s was also the decade that online gaming made its big breakthrough, which can be seen in

02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:59.100
the popularity of new genres like MMOs, real-time strategy games, and first-person shooters.

02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:04.140
With time, online gaming played a greater and greater role in the industry,

02:39:04.700 --> 02:39:10.540
but it was PC that led the charge while providing a glimpse at gaming's future in the process.

02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:23.980
The 90s was the decade where gaming grew up. It began with all our war between Sega and Nintendo,

02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:29.820
but in the end, it was Sony who emerged victorious, and for once, it wasn't because of game design.

02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:35.900
This marked a changing point for the industry. Atari succeeded because they were the ones who

02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:41.020
first brought high-quality arcade games to consoles. Nintendo brought console gaming back

02:39:41.020 --> 02:39:46.060
from the brink with being Nintendo's seal of approval and a focus on high-quality first-party

02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:52.540
titles. Sega finally managed to match Nintendo only after their own Landmark series arrived by

02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:58.300
way of Sonic, and the Game Boy flourished thanks in large part to Tetris and later Pokémon.

02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:05.020
Sony, however, achieved victory through business and hardware, leaving most of the game design to

02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:10.060
those who already knew how and instead placing their focus on effective marketing and designing

02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:15.100
a system that appealed to developers through ease of development. This showed the growing

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:21.580
importance of third parties, who had come a long way since Activision first broke away from Atari

02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:28.300
to get the recognition they felt they deserved. Now, third parties were no longer just an annoyance

02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:33.980
and they were no longer optional. Nintendo filled in a great lineup of first-party titles in the

02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:38.300
fifth generation, with several being remembered as some of the greatest games of all time,

02:40:38.940 --> 02:40:45.100
but the Nintendo 64 had a total of 388 licensed games released in its lifespan

02:40:45.100 --> 02:40:52.860
compared to over 3,000 for the PlayStation. The 90s also saw rapid evolution of technology

02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:59.020
and might be the single most transformative decade in gaming. The move to 3D was a major

02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:04.460
part of this, with arcades leading the way in the early 90s alongside certain pioneering PC

02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:10.380
and console releases. By the end of the 90s, however, the entire industry had embraced 3D

02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:14.780
technology and the advancements being made within just a few years were staggering.

02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:21.980
Alongside 3D, the 90s was also the decade of the CD, which paved the way for full-motion video,

02:41:21.980 --> 02:41:27.260
realistic audio and more detailed textures, and the decade where online gaming and competitive

02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:31.580
multiplayer found their footing, with several new genres being established which would only

02:41:31.580 --> 02:41:38.220
grow in importance in the years to come. Finally, for game design, the 90s was the decade where

02:41:38.220 --> 02:41:44.860
games started to go big and to shed their arcade origins. If someone were to try to pinpoint the

02:41:44.860 --> 02:41:52.700
start of AAA gaming, it might have to be Final Fantasy VII. With a huge budget, a massive marketing

02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:58.300
campaign and a development staff of over 100 people, it was simply a different kind of game

02:41:58.300 --> 02:42:04.060
to what was being produced at the start of the decade. For comparison, many of Nintendo's most

02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:10.780
iconic 16-bit games had development teams of around 10 to 20, but with new technology came

02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:16.620
higher demands on game developers and by the end of the 90s, games in general were becoming bigger

02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:23.260
and more expensive to create. The 90s also saw a substantial move towards the cinematic

02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:28.060
and the idea of games as a unique medium to tell stories rather than just as a set of challenges

02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:33.660
for players to overcome. This can be seen in titles like Metal Gear Solid and Half-Life

02:42:33.660 --> 02:42:37.340
and their popularity clearly showed that this approach resonated with players.

02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:43.260
While at the same time as this, traditional arcade features like high scores and lives

02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:46.620
were starting to disappear amongst gaming's most popular titles.

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:53.260
Overall though, the 90s was an exciting time for gaming, with fierce rivalries, impressive

02:42:53.260 --> 02:43:00.060
technological progress and many new emerging genres. But as a new millennium beckoned,

02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:04.220
the industry was getting ready to experience rapid change all over again.

02:43:11.340 --> 02:43:14.140
The 2000s were a massive decade for video games.

02:43:15.100 --> 02:43:21.420
Technological innovations of the 90s matured with rapid advances in 3D and online. The console

02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:26.940
wars continued with the arrival of the next and final major player, followed by a seventh generation

02:43:26.940 --> 02:43:32.060
that no one could have predicted. And game development moved further towards the AAA,

02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:36.940
at the same time that new areas of the industry started to arrive, changing gaming forever more.

02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:43.340
Still, at the dawn of the new millennium, the gaming industry was defined by uncertainty.

02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:49.660
After months of panic about a Y2K computing apocalypse that in the end didn't happen,

02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:55.500
the industry then ran headfirst into a much realer crisis when the dot-com bubble burst,

02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:59.740
leading to a stock market crash that hit the tech industry particularly hard,

02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:04.540
all of while gamers around the world held their breath in anticipation of the next generation

02:44:04.540 --> 02:44:11.340
of consoles. Many questions were on people's minds. How would Sony follow up the most successful

02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:16.220
console of all time? How would Nintendo respond to losing the top spot in the previous generation?

02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:21.900
Would Sega be able to do enough to survive? And what would be the impact of the computing

02:44:21.900 --> 02:44:26.060
giant Microsoft throwing their hat into the increasingly crowded arena?

02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:31.580
Before the next wave of systems could really get going, however, the previous generation

02:44:31.580 --> 02:44:36.620
enjoyed one of its finest years, as developers pushed fifth-gen consoles to their limits,

02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:43.660
and PC saw the arrival of its best-selling game yet. Highlights on the Nintendo 64

02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:48.220
include the surreal sequel to Ocarina of Time, a legend of Zelda Majora's Mask,

02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:53.500
which featured a time loop mechanic alongside a surprisingly dark tone to create an experience

02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:59.980
just as memorable as its predecessor and almost as universally acclaimed. Perfect Dark from N64

02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:04.460
Heavyweight Rare, which was a spiritual successor to GoldenEye that built upon the landmark Shooters

02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:08.940
gameplay while adding a multitude more options to create the fifth generation's definitive

02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:15.020
first-person shooter, and Paper Mario, which continued the Mario RPG tradition established

02:45:15.020 --> 02:45:19.580
on the Super Nintendo with a new take on the concept and a new two-dimensional art style.

02:45:21.260 --> 02:45:25.500
On the PlayStation, Final Fantasy continued its strong critical and commercial run with Final

02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:30.940
Fantasy 9, which featured a return to the more traditional fancy settings of older games alongside

02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:36.380
some of the most spectacular pre-rendered graphics on the system. 2000 was also a year that Final

02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:41.820
Fantasy was joined by the 32-bit debut of its great rival in Dragon Quest 7, which quickly

02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:46.940
went on to become the best-selling PlayStation game of all time in Japan despite its late release.

02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:53.660
And finally, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 refined the formula of its 1999 predecessor to become one

02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:59.500
of the most critically acclaimed games ever made. It might be tempting to see Tony Hawk's as just

02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:04.700
a series of well-made skating games, but to do so would be a great injustice, as they were clear

02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:09.900
examples of games so good they transcended their genre with simple yet addictively enjoyable

02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:14.380
gameplay that helped them secure an immortal place within early 2000s gaming culture.

02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:21.100
The PC also saw its share of big releases, with RPG fans in particular being spoilt for choice.

02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:27.180
Bioware's follow-up to Baldur's Gate provided an expansive and deep sequel that still remains

02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:32.380
as one of the best examples of its genre to this day. Ion Storm's cyberpunk conspiracy

02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:37.100
thriller Deus Ex impressed with its open-ended mission design and high level of player choice,

02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:43.340
and Blizzard's loop-filled action RPG series Diablo returned in its second entry with improvements

02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:49.420
to gameplay and a story that made it even more popular than its predecessor. 2000s would also

02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:54.140
see the release of another important FPS that offered something markedly different from the

02:46:54.140 --> 02:47:00.380
popular arena shooters of the time. Originally a mod for Half-Life, Counter-Strike placed a

02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:05.180
greater focus on realism and the tactical side of the genre and quickly received plenty of attention

02:47:05.180 --> 02:47:10.620
online including from Half-Life creators Valve who offered to buy the intellectual property

02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:16.460
and hire the mods creator before releasing the game officially. Counter-Strike helped create

02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:21.500
an enduring esports scene as well as a number of hugely successful sequels and showed the

02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:26.220
innovative nature and potential benefits of a game supporting modding, something that has

02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:32.780
become increasingly rare in games as times went on. Of course none of the games mentioned so far

02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:39.340
come close to matching the impact of the year's biggest release. From Maxis and SimCity creator

02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:46.540
Will Wright, The Sims was like nothing else before it. As a social simulation with impressive

02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:52.380
building tools, Sims turned life itself into a video game and wowed players with the amount of

02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:58.300
freedom it gave them and the level of detail it managed to include. From carefully guiding your

02:47:58.300 --> 02:48:03.980
Sims up the corporate ladder and finally purchasing the local mega mansion to turning their life into

02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:10.620
an inescapable never-ending hell, The Sims was a massive hit with players and received 7 expansions

02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:17.100
which was a huge amount for the time. It also sold over 11 million copies making it the best

02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:22.140
selling PC game of all time until it was overtaken several years later by its sequel.

02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:29.180
Much like Pac-Man or Tetris before it, The Sims was a game which found unprecedented levels of

02:48:29.180 --> 02:48:35.900
success by appealing to people who may not have typically played video games. By 2000 personal

02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:41.260
computers were starting to become a common household item and The Sims universally understandable

02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:46.860
concept and general accessibility made it the perfect gateway to the medium for those who may

02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:51.900
not have been swayed by the fast paced deathmatches of Quake or the advanced Dungeons and Dragons

02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:59.580
of computer RPGs. Accessibility and broadened appeal would be a major part of the decade but

02:48:59.580 --> 02:49:04.780
not before the next generation of console wars got underway in fittingly dramatic fashion.

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:15.820
The Dreamcast got off to a solid start and its launch lineup was followed by a number of memorable

02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:21.340
titles. The most important was Shenmue which Sega hoped to be the system's killer app.

02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:28.540
Featuring advanced 3D graphics and FMV cutscenes alongside a detailed open world complete with

02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:34.300
NPC schedules, variable weather effects and a day-night cycle Shenmue was a major step forward

02:49:34.300 --> 02:49:40.460
for open world game design. Ambitious, innovative and technologically impressive it received much

02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:48.300
critical praise and sold well although unfortunately not well enough. With development costs of around

02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:54.300
50 million dollars Shenmue was one of the most expensive games ever made and its sales of 1.2

02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:59.820
million weren't enough to recoup such a high investment. It also didn't become the major

02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:05.420
system seller Sega hoped it would be meaning for the Dreamcast there was still more work that needed

02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:12.540
to be done. Other strong early performers on the system included Crazy Taxi, an arcade infused

02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:18.940
action packed racing game, Jet Set Radio a skating action hybrid that embodied counterculture and was

02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:24.780
one of the first games to feature the use of cell shading and Fantasy Star Online a continuation of

02:50:24.780 --> 02:50:32.700
Sega's popular fantasy star series and the first ever online RPG to appear on consoles. Fantasy Star

02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:38.220
Online showcased the Dreamcast's impressive online capabilities and was particularly successful

02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:44.780
with Japanese audiences where online PC gaming still hadn't really caught on. In the end though

02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:50.940
the Dreamcast's fate would be decided more by its competition than its games and 2000

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:55.260
was the year that Sony's next gen successor was ready to make its debut.

02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:15.580
Following the tremendous success of the PlayStation many were left wondering how Sony would top the

02:51:15.580 --> 02:51:22.140
best selling games console of all time. Sony's answer was to leave people wondering meaning

02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:27.020
information about the PlayStation 2's development was kept as secret as possible with Sony refusing

02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:33.420
to even confirm that they were working on a new system. Secrecy wouldn't last forever though and

02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:40.620
at the Tokyo Game Show in September of 1999 the PlayStation 2 was revealed with demos for Gran Turismo

02:51:40.620 --> 02:51:46.540
and Tekken to show off its next gen graphical capability. It wasn't the games or graphics

02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:51.020
that impressed the audience the most though but rather two specific design features.

02:51:52.220 --> 02:51:56.940
The first was full backwards compatibility that covered the entire PlayStation 1 library

02:51:56.940 --> 02:52:02.220
as well as some of its accessories like its controllers. At the time backwards compatibility

02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:07.740
was an often requested feature yet the only other console to provide it without additional add-ons

02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:15.260
had been the otherwise disappointing Atari 7800. And if backwards compatibility alone wasn't enough

02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:21.340
the PlayStation 2 also included a built-in DVD player. This was when DVD players were still

02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:28.220
relatively new and standalone units could often cost more than the PS2's 299 launch price which

02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:33.900
made it seem like great value for money and helped its reputation as being more than just a games console.

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:39.420
When this was combined with the strong momentum behind Sony's brand after the success of their

02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:45.020
last system it was enough to ensure the PlayStation 2's launch was a big success with the new console

02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:51.740
selling out in Japan and later America as Sony struggled to meet the high demand. The launch

02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:56.780
lineup was also noticeably weak with few heavy hitters outside of perhaps Tekken tag tournament

02:52:56.780 --> 02:53:03.420
from Namco and low first party titles from Sony but in the end this didn't matter too much as in

02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:09.820
October 2000 the PlayStation 2 finally arrived in America and quickly became the public's most

02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:12.860
wanted games console.

02:53:40.460 --> 02:53:46.540
For Sega the impact was immediate and amidst now rapidly declining Dreamcast sales

02:53:46.540 --> 02:53:52.060
and yearly losses of over 400 million dollars the discontinuation of a Dreamcast was announced

02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:59.980
on the 31st of January 2001. This would be the end of the line for Sega's hardware aspirations

02:53:59.980 --> 02:54:06.300
but they would live on as a third party developer and publisher and in March 2003 the company finally

02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:12.940
had a profitable year again after five years of consecutive losses. As for Sony having collected

02:54:12.940 --> 02:54:18.300
one scalp already they turned their attention to those who remained and prepared themselves

02:54:18.300 --> 02:54:22.300
for what would go on to be one of the biggest years in video game history.

02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:44.700
Microsoft unveiled their debut gaming system at the consumer electronic show in January 2001

02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:49.900
and right from the start Microsoft wanted the world to know how seriously they were taking

02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:54.620
the industry with major marketing campaigns being launched alongside offers to acquire

02:54:54.620 --> 02:55:02.620
several big players including Nintendo, Square and EA. The decision to enter the console space came

02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:08.300
after seeing the PlayStation success in the last generation with then-CEO Bill Gates worried that

02:55:08.300 --> 02:55:13.740
an unopposed Sony could become so dominant that they might threaten Microsoft's line of Windows

02:55:13.740 --> 02:55:20.300
PCs. Microsoft had also seen the way the PlayStation's PC focus development kits had won them third

02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:27.420
party support which led to the idea of just creating a console using PC hardware and DirectX

02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:34.220
programming interfaces with the use of DirectX being what led to the console being named Xbox.

02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:41.100
The result was a powerful system with technical specifications notably beyond any of its competitors.

02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:47.900
The console included a built-in DVD player just like the PS2 as well as a hard drive and impressive

02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:57.260
online support but Microsoft was called MicroSoft for a reason i.e. they were a software company

02:55:57.580 --> 02:56:01.660
meaning that at the time they had no actual experience in manufacturing hardware.

02:56:02.860 --> 02:56:08.860
This led to expensive development and manufacturing costs with Microsoft ultimately making a loss

02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:15.020
on each unit sold. Still luckily for them if there was one thing Microsoft did have available

02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:22.300
it was money and in November 2001 the Xbox released in America three days before the

02:56:22.300 --> 02:56:44.940
arrival of the sixth gen's final contender. Nintendo might have been down after their last

02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:50.300
gen defeat in the PlayStation but unlike Sega they were far from out with dominance still in the

02:56:50.300 --> 02:56:57.100
handheld market and a strong selection of established first party series. For their next system

02:56:57.100 --> 02:57:02.540
Nintendo's priority was to avoid the mistakes which cost them with their last console. This

02:57:02.540 --> 02:57:08.220
meant no more cartridges although they didn't opt for a DVD based system either and instead used the

02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:14.300
more data limited mini-disc. They also tried to ensure the system was easier to develop for

02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:17.420
and that it didn't release significantly later than the rest of the competition.

02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:24.940
Nintendo did try out several more experimental features including stereoscopic 3D, motion controls,

02:57:24.940 --> 02:57:30.940
portability and microphone support but for now these ideas played little role in the final console.

02:57:31.980 --> 02:57:37.580
And so Nintendo's GameCube was a fairly traditional system that was less powerful than

02:57:37.580 --> 02:57:44.220
Microsoft's Xbox but with a slight technological edge over Sony's PS2 in CPU and graphics card.

02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:49.500
The marketing focused on Nintendo's reputation and first party success

02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:55.820
making use of the catchphrase the Nintendo difference but one thing which did remain the same

02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:59.980
was a lack of effort on Nintendo's part to entice third party exclusives.

02:58:01.260 --> 02:58:06.380
Nintendo also weren't able to meet their initial target of the holiday season in the year 2000

02:58:06.380 --> 02:58:11.180
which would have seen their new console launch alongside Sony's but at least this time they

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:18.220
wouldn't be quite so far behind and at E3 2001 the system was fully unveiled with Shigeru Miyamoto

02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:22.860
himself taking to the stage to announce the release date and launch lineup with a later

02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:29.420
price reveal putting the GameCube at $199, 100 less than its two rivals.

02:58:30.940 --> 02:58:36.940
Unlike every Nintendo console before it however something or someone was noticeably absent

02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:42.220
as for the first time Nintendo would be launching their system without a Mario game to support it.

02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:49.340
In Mario's place was his brother in Luigi's Mansion which went on to receive positive reviews

02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:53.740
but was a far cry from the generational defining Mario titles of earlier consoles.

02:58:55.180 --> 02:59:00.540
Luckily for Nintendo though even if Luigi wasn't able to develop to his big brother's big reputation

02:59:00.540 --> 02:59:03.820
Nintendo did have another title mere months away which could.

02:59:04.780 --> 02:59:12.140
Super Smash Bros. Melee tipped the formula of its predecessor and ran with it featuring more characters,

02:59:12.140 --> 02:59:17.660
more stages, more gameplay modes, more music and updated multiplayer but ensured it would

02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:23.500
be a hit with fans and critics alike even decades later. Melee went on to be the GameCube's best

02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:28.780
selling title and acted as a fantastic showcase of what Nintendo were bringing to the sixth generation.

02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:34.780
Microsoft however had a killer app of their own to mark their entry into the console space.

02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:40.220
Most of Microsoft's early efforts to buy third party developers weren't successful

02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:45.020
but one company they did acquire was a relatively unknown yet still successful

02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:52.380
Macintosh developer by the name of Bungie. The studio's sci-fi FPS series Marathon was exactly

02:59:52.380 --> 02:59:57.660
the type of game that might appeal to western audiences but its Mac only status had previously

02:59:57.660 --> 03:00:03.820
limited its reach. In the late 90s Bungie had begun work on a follow-up to Marathon and after

03:00:03.820 --> 03:00:11.260
it was unveiled at 1999's Mac World Expo by none other than Apple CEO Steve Jobs, Microsoft decided

03:00:11.260 --> 03:00:16.220
to swoop in and make their move, impressing the team at Bungie with their commitment to the gaming

03:00:16.220 --> 03:00:22.380
industry and securing the studio and their new title exclusively for Xbox in the process.

03:00:22.460 --> 03:00:28.380
With this Microsoft had now found their tempo title to centre the Xbox's launch around but for

03:00:28.380 --> 03:00:34.620
Bungie things would be far from simple. The switch from computer to console brought a number of

03:00:34.620 --> 03:00:39.900
development challenges. The team's deadline was incredibly tight and the weight of an entire new

03:00:39.900 --> 03:00:47.100
console was being placed quite squarely on their game's shoulders. In the end though Halo proved

03:00:48.060 --> 03:00:53.820
up to the task launching alongside the Xbox and becoming an instant critical and commercial success.

03:00:55.020 --> 03:01:01.660
Halo was a very ambitious game. The biggest surprise then might be that in the end all its

03:01:01.660 --> 03:01:08.540
ambitions seemed to pay off. Featuring vehicle combat alongside massive open world like environments

03:01:08.540 --> 03:01:15.660
with impressive enemy variety, AI behaviour and encounter design Halo was a fantastic game but

03:01:15.660 --> 03:01:21.820
even more impressive was how well it played on console. Bungie added subtle auto-aim to

03:01:21.820 --> 03:01:26.940
accommodate for the use of a gamepad over a mouse and used a system of input buffering to make

03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:33.100
movements feel smoother and more precise. The result was a huge step forward for the console

03:01:33.100 --> 03:01:42.460
FPS genre and the creation of Xbox's first true blockbuster title. But while Nintendo had Melee

03:01:42.460 --> 03:01:49.340
and Microsoft had Halo, Sony on the other hand had what might be the single greatest year of

03:01:49.340 --> 03:01:58.620
console exclusives in all of video game history. 2001 was massive for the PlayStation 2. Many of

03:01:58.620 --> 03:02:05.260
the PS1's best-selling series would see sequels with Gran Turismo 3, A-Spec, Final Fantasy 10 and

03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:11.500
Metal Gear Solid 2 each releasing to universal acclaim and incredible sales. What's more each

03:02:11.500 --> 03:02:16.220
of these games showcased outstanding graphics making the difference in the new generation

03:02:16.220 --> 03:02:22.940
crystal clear to potential buyers. Alongside these was another important title that would leave a

03:02:22.940 --> 03:02:29.500
lasting impact on game design and would kick off the PS2's best-selling series Rockstars

03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:37.260
Grand Theft Auto 3. This wasn't the first Grand Theft Auto game but it was the first in 3D and

03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:42.540
its fully open world and emphasis on player freedom was unlike anything that came before it.

03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:48.140
It remains a landmark open world game and did much to change people's conception of what

03:02:48.140 --> 03:02:53.980
video games could achieve and this was still just one of many major titles releasing on the

03:02:53.980 --> 03:03:01.340
PlayStation 2 that year. Looking back today the most impressive thing about the PS2's 2001 release

03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:07.900
lineup is surely its diversity with different genres and tastes being catered to and innovative

03:03:07.900 --> 03:03:14.300
new titles coming alongside the more expected big sequels. Ico gave players something original,

03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:20.220
mature and creative. Capcom's Devil May Cry brought arcade inspired action and created its own

03:03:20.220 --> 03:03:25.660
new genre in the process. Konami's Silent Hill 2 gave the console one of the greatest horror games

03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:30.940
ever made. Naughty Dogs Jack and Daxter brought Sony a major new series and offered something

03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:37.260
a little more lighthearted and there are other games that could be mentioned here too. The PlayStation

03:03:37.260 --> 03:03:43.740
2's lineup was stacked and this was exactly what Sony needed to keep them on top amidst the launch

03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:50.060
of their rivals new consoles. Still even if the PlayStation 2 would end the year ahead,

03:03:50.060 --> 03:03:55.820
both the Xbox and Gamecube did see strong initial sales with many retailers selling out of the

03:03:55.820 --> 03:04:02.700
systems. Each console also had its own clear advantage with the Gamecube being the cheapest

03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:09.900
and the Xbox being the most technologically advanced and so in 2002 Sony set out to take

03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:16.940
those advantages away. To do this they cut the price of the PS2 to $199 to bring it in line with

03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:22.540
the Gamecube and set about creating a PlayStation Network adapter add on alongside several first

03:04:22.540 --> 03:04:28.940
party online focus titles like Socom to compete with Microsoft soon to be launching Xbox Live.

03:04:30.380 --> 03:04:35.980
2002 would also bring a number of PS2 exclusives with the three biggest being Square's latest

03:04:35.980 --> 03:04:41.420
action RPG Kingdom Hearts which combined Final Fantasy characters with massive Disney franchises,

03:04:41.980 --> 03:04:46.460
Insomniac Games Ratchet and Clank, an important action platformer that would get a number of

03:04:46.460 --> 03:04:53.020
sequels on the system and Rockstar's Grand 5th Auto Vice City which followed on from GTA 3

03:04:53.020 --> 03:04:58.860
by bringing the series to a new city and new decade and found even greater success in the process.

03:05:00.380 --> 03:05:05.100
Nintendo and Microsoft had other important titles in the following years as well but each

03:05:05.100 --> 03:05:11.420
company would also experience their own third party struggles. Nintendo did finally receive

03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:16.140
the Mario game they needed with Super Mario Sunshine which featured a tropical setting

03:05:16.140 --> 03:05:22.620
and a new spin on 3D Mario gameplay. Other classic Nintendo series would also get new entries

03:05:22.620 --> 03:05:27.980
with Metroid Prime seeing Metroid make its 3D debut in an atmospheric and immersive take on

03:05:27.980 --> 03:05:33.900
earlier games that retained much of what made the original special. Zelda returned with Wind Waker

03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:38.700
which saw players take to the ocean and explore many islands in a new cell shaded art style

03:05:38.700 --> 03:05:44.060
that was a dramatic departure from the previous games. Mario Kart returned with Double Dash

03:05:44.060 --> 03:05:49.740
which replaced the sprite to be N64 version with full 3D and allowed two riders per kart

03:05:49.740 --> 03:05:55.740
to provide a new take on co-op gameplay. Animal Crossing and Pikmin made their debuts giving

03:05:55.740 --> 03:06:01.740
players a relaxed open-ended life sim alongside a highly original real-time strategy puzzle game

03:06:02.380 --> 03:06:07.980
and other Nintendo series like Mario Party rounded out what was admittedly a strong first

03:06:07.980 --> 03:06:15.180
party lineup. When it came to third party support however Nintendo were once more at a disadvantage

03:06:15.180 --> 03:06:19.820
after having done little to secure exclusive third party titles in the lead up to the sixth

03:06:19.820 --> 03:06:26.140
generation. What's more rare a developer who had done more to support Nintendo than any other in

03:06:26.140 --> 03:06:31.420
the last two generations started to experience financial difficulties and were forced to look

03:06:31.420 --> 03:06:37.020
for a buyer. Nintendo already had a significant stake in the company and could have purchased the

03:06:37.020 --> 03:06:43.420
rest but they instead declined leaving room for other interested parties like Nintendo's newest

03:06:43.420 --> 03:06:50.060
rival Microsoft. While rare did release one Gamecube title before this their acquisition

03:06:50.060 --> 03:06:55.660
by Microsoft still left Nintendo's already lacklustre third party support even more lacking.

03:06:57.180 --> 03:07:01.420
In a strange twist of fate one of Nintendo's most prominent third party developers in this

03:07:01.420 --> 03:07:07.820
period was none other than Sega who brought a number of series to the Gamecube including Sonic

03:07:07.820 --> 03:07:14.700
and Fantasy Star. The only other notable third party that provided exclusives was Capcom who

03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:19.980
would bring a number of Resident Evil games including timed exclusivity on Resident Evil 4

03:07:19.980 --> 03:07:27.500
alongside some new IPs. Still while the Gamecube did have exclusives it also found itself left out

03:07:27.500 --> 03:07:34.220
of certain multi-platform releases as the generations stretched on. Some examples include

03:07:34.220 --> 03:07:41.260
Burnout 3, Black, Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2, certain entries into the Pro Evolution

03:07:41.260 --> 03:07:47.340
Soccer series, Hitman contracts and Blood Money, Binlight Club 2 and so on.

03:07:48.380 --> 03:07:53.100
Individually none of these titles may have been deal breakers but the cumulative effect

03:07:53.180 --> 03:07:57.660
meant the Gamecube had the smallest library and came to be seen as the worst system for

03:07:57.660 --> 03:08:04.060
multi-platform games. Microsoft would also eventually bring Grand 5th Auto over to Xbox

03:08:04.060 --> 03:08:09.020
once more leaving Nintendo out of what was arguably the biggest series in gaming at the time.

03:08:10.380 --> 03:08:14.620
To make matters worse Nintendo were also increasingly finding that they were developing

03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:20.300
an image problem in Western markets. Amidst the gaming industry that was putting out more and

03:08:20.300 --> 03:08:26.300
more mature titles and marketing from Sony and Microsoft aimed at securing older audiences,

03:08:26.300 --> 03:08:31.020
Nintendo's Gamecube came to be seen as the console for younger audiences.

03:08:32.460 --> 03:08:37.820
This reputation had been developing since their showdown with Sega but now it was starting to do

03:08:37.820 --> 03:08:43.580
real damage, particularly with teenagers who might place a lot of value on how a gaming system is

03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:51.260
seen by their peers. It may no longer be true today but in the early to mid 2000s Gamecube

03:08:51.260 --> 03:08:59.420
just wasn't cool and this had an impact on sales. Meanwhile with the Xbox, Microsoft also faced

03:08:59.420 --> 03:09:06.140
problems as they struggled to provide Master Chief with any backup. Attempts were made though,

03:09:06.140 --> 03:09:10.300
Project Gotham Racing received strong reviews but failed to come close to matching the sales of

03:09:10.300 --> 03:09:16.300
Sony's mega hit Gran Turismo. Blinks the Time Sweeper would see key star from the Sonic series

03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:21.500
creating an Xbox exclusive platformer but it too failed to make a major impact

03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:27.340
and new acquisition Rare failed to live up to their past heights with games like Grabbed by

03:09:27.340 --> 03:09:33.740
the Goolies and Conquer Live and Reloaded. Microsoft's most prominent third party support

03:09:33.740 --> 03:09:39.020
came from Japanese publisher Tecmo who made a deal early on with Microsoft and contributed

03:09:39.020 --> 03:09:45.980
the popular fighting series Dead or Alive and the 3D action debut of Ninja Gaiden as well as from

03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:53.020
several former PC developers who brought a number of RPGs to the console. These included Bethesda's

03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:59.740
breakthrough open world RPG The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind, Lionhead's ambitious new IP Fable

03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:05.340
and BioWare's popular Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire.

03:10:05.580 --> 03:10:09.980
These RPGs would go on to be some of the most highly acclaimed titles on the system and further

03:10:09.980 --> 03:10:15.980
cemented Xbox's growing reputation with Western audiences. But compared to the PlayStation 2's

03:10:15.980 --> 03:10:20.860
continually expanding library, the Xbox still had a lot less to offer by comparison.

03:10:22.060 --> 03:10:28.220
As a result, Microsoft placed great hope on their upcoming online service Xbox Live which

03:10:29.180 --> 03:10:33.180
launched one year after the console in November 2002.

03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:41.260
Xbox Live was an impressive service for its time, featuring friends lists, voice communication

03:10:41.260 --> 03:10:46.620
and fast matchmaking while making use of an ethernet port and the faster broadband connection

03:10:46.620 --> 03:10:53.020
over the still popular dial up. Its flagship launch title was Epic's Unreal Championship,

03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:57.660
but a disagreement with Electronic Arts over the terms of the new service led to EA

03:10:57.660 --> 03:11:01.500
withholding all of their games from Xbox Live for its first few years.

03:11:02.780 --> 03:11:08.060
Still, Xbox's online system was a success and launched before Sony's alternative

03:11:08.060 --> 03:11:14.060
without the need for any additional hardware. Its impact on the industry hadn't been quite

03:11:14.060 --> 03:11:19.340
as dramatic as Microsoft had hoped for though, or at least it wasn't, until the services

03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:36.140
killer app arrived in 2004. Halo 2's campaign was a solid follow up from the first game,

03:11:36.140 --> 03:11:42.940
but this wasn't the main thing it came to be known for. With Halo 2, Microsoft's best series

03:11:42.940 --> 03:11:48.620
was able to take advantage of their console's best feature and it turned out to be a match made

03:11:48.620 --> 03:11:54.140
in heaven. Halo 1's multiplayer had already impressed, but for many players this would

03:11:54.140 --> 03:12:00.460
be their first experience moving from split screen to online and the improvement was dramatic.

03:12:01.580 --> 03:12:06.060
Halo 2 quickly became the console's best selling game and the most popular thing on

03:12:06.060 --> 03:12:11.820
Xbox Live, vindicating Microsoft's decision to prioritize online features on their console

03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:16.700
while also creating one of the most fondly remembered multiplayer experiences of all time.

03:12:17.980 --> 03:12:25.500
But as successful as Halo 2 was, it wasn't the best selling game in 2004. In fact, it wasn't even

03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:31.500
close, as just when Xbox fans finally had a real reason to celebrate their console's superiority,

03:12:31.500 --> 03:12:37.900
the PlayStation 2 would see the arrival of its own best selling game with Grand Theft Auto San

03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:46.300
Andreas, which would go on to reach an unprecedented 17 million copies sold on PlayStation 2 alone.

03:12:47.580 --> 03:12:52.140
San Andreas took the open world design of the previous games and drastically increased the

03:12:52.140 --> 03:12:57.980
scale, featuring three distinct cities instead of one alongside many new features that improved

03:12:57.980 --> 03:13:03.820
immersion and customization. The game did come alongside controversy, particularly after the

03:13:03.820 --> 03:13:08.780
modern community were able to uncover a hidden code left in the game's files but enabled a crude

03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:15.260
sex minigame which led to outrage and a revision of the game's rating from the ESRB to the very

03:13:15.260 --> 03:13:21.260
rarely used adult only rating. Still, this wasn't enough to stop it from becoming one of the most

03:13:21.260 --> 03:13:27.740
successful games of all time and Sony's PlayStation 2 flourished alongside it, receiving an updated

03:13:27.740 --> 03:13:33.020
slim model the month before its release and promptly selling out again during the holiday season.

03:13:34.300 --> 03:13:39.020
The final years of the sixth generation would see Sony continuing to add to their already

03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:46.380
strong lineup of games with high selling sequels to Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy,

03:13:46.380 --> 03:13:52.700
Tekken and Kingdom Hearts alongside an impressive new action series in Santa Monica Studios God of War.

03:13:53.980 --> 03:13:58.860
Unique titles came alongside the bigger names as well, with games like Team Icos visually

03:13:58.860 --> 03:14:04.220
stunning and emotionally evocative Shadow of the Colossus or the weird and wonderful Katamari

03:14:04.220 --> 03:14:12.140
Damacy from Namco. Truthfully, neither the Xbox or GameCube had bad lineups of games,

03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:18.460
the PlayStation 2 was just on another level and this would ultimately be reflected in its sales.

03:14:19.820 --> 03:14:26.620
Over its long, long life, the PlayStation 2 sold over 155 million units worldwide,

03:14:27.260 --> 03:14:32.780
making it the best-selling gaming system of all time, a title it still holds to this day.

03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:41.180
By contrast, the Xbox and GameCube sold 24 million and 21.7 million units respectively,

03:14:41.740 --> 03:14:47.260
making this the most decisive victory of any console generation since the Nintendo Entertainment

03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:53.580
System brought the home video game market back from the dead. Sony benefited from strong third

03:14:53.580 --> 03:15:00.140
party support, the built-in DVD player, backwards compatibility, a highly competitive price and

03:15:00.140 --> 03:15:06.380
a growing reputation of excellence in the console market. For both Microsoft and Nintendo,

03:15:06.380 --> 03:15:11.740
there would be silver linings however. The Xbox successfully forged itself a place within the

03:15:11.740 --> 03:15:17.260
console market, took second place in a highly competitive generation and found great success

03:15:17.260 --> 03:15:23.820
with Halo and Xbox Live, two things which showed much promise for the future as online gaming and

03:15:23.820 --> 03:15:30.380
home broadband both continued to become more and more widely adopted. Meanwhile for Nintendo,

03:15:30.380 --> 03:15:35.100
they continued to build on their established first-party series while cementing their reputation

03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:40.540
for making quality games. The GameCube may have suffered due to its perception as being for

03:15:40.540 --> 03:15:47.820
younger audiences, but Nintendo may not have. Younger gamers will one day grow up and by staying

03:15:47.820 --> 03:15:53.180
true to their vision and creating great games for all ages, Nintendo continued to create franchises

03:15:53.180 --> 03:15:58.380
with strong nostalgic appeal and sometimes nostalgia can have great dividends in the future.

03:15:59.740 --> 03:16:04.780
In the end, it seems fitting that the GameCube's best-selling game would be the crossover title

03:16:04.780 --> 03:16:10.460
Super Smash Bros. Melee as no other game better represented the system's appeal or Nintendo's

03:16:10.460 --> 03:16:16.060
strengths. Nintendo's different approach also allowed them to set themselves apart from the

03:16:16.060 --> 03:16:22.300
competition and while that isn't always the best strategy to win, it can sometimes help you survive.

03:16:23.580 --> 03:16:32.860
And ultimately, survive they did, as did Microsoft and while Sony's lead may have looked insurmountable,

03:16:33.420 --> 03:16:37.100
gaming has always been an industry where things can change quickly.

03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:43.820
Before a new wave of consoles could go head-to-head however, the handheld market would finally get

03:16:43.820 --> 03:16:55.580
to experience a console war of its own. Nintendo had dominated the handheld market since as far

03:16:55.580 --> 03:17:01.340
back as the original Game and Watch in 1980 and after the Game Boy beat out a number of rivals in

03:17:01.340 --> 03:17:08.860
the early 90s, Nintendo spent years being virtually unopposed. Their reign continued in the early 2000s

03:17:08.860 --> 03:17:16.140
with long-awaited Game Boy Advance, which released worldwide in 2001. The system still lacked a

03:17:16.140 --> 03:17:22.460
backlit screen, a feature other handhelds had included as early as the Atari Lynx in 1989,

03:17:23.020 --> 03:17:29.500
but otherwise it launched at an affordable $99 and compared to the now seriously dated Game Boy,

03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:36.620
it provided a decent step up. The original Game Boy was technically inferior to the 8-bit NES,

03:17:36.620 --> 03:17:42.220
whereas outside of the smaller screen resolution, the Game Boy Advance was technically superior

03:17:42.220 --> 03:17:49.100
to the 16-bit Super Nintendo. This had clear benefits for games so long as you could see them

03:17:49.100 --> 03:17:54.380
on the poorly illuminated screen that once more got to haunt a new generation of children.

03:17:55.340 --> 03:18:01.500
Nintendo would follow the Game Boy Advance with the Advance SP two years later, which updated the

03:18:01.500 --> 03:18:08.940
model and finally included a light source. And now that Game Boy owners could at last see what games

03:18:08.940 --> 03:18:14.140
they were actually playing, they were in for a treat because the Game Boy Advance had an extensive

03:18:14.140 --> 03:18:20.060
library on top of backwards compatibility with the original Game Boy's cartridges. The system's

03:18:20.060 --> 03:18:26.300
best-selling game was Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, its second best-selling game was Pokemon Fire Red

03:18:26.300 --> 03:18:32.300
and Leaf Green, and its third best-selling game was Pokemon Emerald. But it had successful games

03:18:32.300 --> 03:18:38.220
outside of Pokemon as well as all the Nintendo series you'd expect, with plenty of ports of

03:18:38.220 --> 03:18:44.620
Super Nintendo classics. One thing it didn't have was an original Mario title of its own,

03:18:44.620 --> 03:18:50.220
but without any competition that hardly mattered, and the Game Boy Advance and Advance SP were

03:18:50.220 --> 03:18:57.340
highly successful, with sales of over 81 million units. Still, Nintendo's era of free reign wouldn't

03:18:57.340 --> 03:19:04.460
last forever, and at E3 2003 it was reeled that they would face new competition from the same

03:19:04.460 --> 03:19:10.300
company who had just beaten them twice in the home console market. PlayStation Portable will allow

03:19:10.300 --> 03:19:16.940
consumers to enjoy 3D gaming similar to the experience delivered on PlayStation 2. It also

03:19:16.940 --> 03:19:22.780
has the ability to deliver high-quality movies, music, and video as well as other forms of digital

03:19:22.780 --> 03:19:29.660
entertainment content through one central device. And all of this is made possible through cutting

03:19:29.660 --> 03:19:37.740
edge technologies aimed at helping us explore the future in new ways. Sony had dabbled in the handheld

03:19:37.820 --> 03:19:43.260
space already with the Pocket Station, a portable add-on for the PlayStation 1 that released in

03:19:43.260 --> 03:19:50.780
1999 exclusively in Japan. Their next attempt would be rather more ambitious, and the announcement

03:19:50.780 --> 03:19:56.460
showed off some impressively powerful technical specifications alongside a heavy focus on multimedia

03:19:56.460 --> 03:20:05.500
support, with movies, music, and online web browsing. Sony's plan was simple, do for handhelds

03:20:05.500 --> 03:20:11.340
what they did for consoles through following the same approach, i.e. good hardware, disk-based

03:20:11.340 --> 03:20:19.260
operating, functionality outside of games, and strong third-party support. And, as for that hardware,

03:20:19.260 --> 03:20:25.820
Sony were keen to highlight just how similar it was to the still mid-cycle PlayStation 2,

03:20:25.820 --> 03:20:30.860
at a time when Nintendo's current handheld was only on the level of a two-generations-old

03:20:30.860 --> 03:20:37.020
Super Nintendo, and their next handheld was being developed in line with the last gen N64.

03:20:38.300 --> 03:20:44.140
Basically, Sony was planning to skip ahead and deliver a product a whole generation more advanced

03:20:44.140 --> 03:20:51.980
than their rival. For Nintendo, however, power wasn't the main priority. The idea for their next

03:20:51.980 --> 03:20:59.820
system came from Hiroshi Yamauchi, a man who served as Nintendo president for an incredible 53 years.

03:21:00.860 --> 03:21:05.740
The dual screens were similar to certain models of the game and watch, and Nintendo wanted to use

03:21:05.740 --> 03:21:10.620
their new system as a chance to innovate and move away from the conservative image that they were

03:21:10.620 --> 03:21:16.860
worried they'd started to develop. Nintendo were still taking the handheld market seriously, though.

03:21:16.860 --> 03:21:21.740
In fact, after the mediocre sales of the GameCube, the next generation of handhelds came to be seen

03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:27.260
as more important than ever, with President Yamauchi famously saying that if the new system

03:21:27.340 --> 03:21:32.380
succeeds, we will rise to heaven, but if it fails, we will sink to hell.

03:21:33.660 --> 03:21:39.740
And so, Sony's PlayStation Portable and Nintendo's DS went head-to-head.

03:21:40.780 --> 03:21:44.860
Both systems launched at a similar time in Japan in 2004,

03:21:44.860 --> 03:21:50.780
although the DS had a four-to-five-month head start in other regions. The DS also had a lower

03:21:50.780 --> 03:21:58.940
retail price of $150 to the PSP's $250. Meanwhile, the PSP had a clear advantage in hardware,

03:21:58.940 --> 03:22:05.420
with a larger display, higher resolution, and a much more powerful CPU. This translated to far

03:22:05.420 --> 03:22:11.340
better graphics, with the PSP succeeding at coming close to PS2 level, minus the smaller

03:22:11.340 --> 03:22:18.060
resolution, whereas the DS was still clearly one generation behind. Nintendo's new system

03:22:18.060 --> 03:22:22.780
did come with a touchscreen, however, and this was several years before the arrival of smartphones,

03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:29.420
meaning few people had seen this technology before. The combination of two screens and

03:22:29.420 --> 03:22:35.740
touch-based controls did make the DS stand out, but it wasn't initially clear to prospective buyers

03:22:35.740 --> 03:22:39.420
just how big an impact this would have on their gaming experiences.

03:22:40.620 --> 03:22:46.140
And so, as both systems launched, the PSP was the one generating the most hype,

03:22:46.220 --> 03:22:51.100
with reviewers impressed by the system's power and with Sony riding high off the momentum

03:22:51.100 --> 03:22:57.340
of two record-breaking home consoles. In Japan, both systems got off to strong starts,

03:22:57.340 --> 03:23:02.540
with the PSP selling out faster, but the DS selling more units due to greater supply.

03:23:03.820 --> 03:23:08.860
In America, the PSP released later and performed below Sony's expectations,

03:23:08.860 --> 03:23:14.540
while the DS surpassed Nintendo's. Europe saw more or less the opposite though,

03:23:14.620 --> 03:23:19.500
as while the PSP again arrived late, this time it sold out at record speeds,

03:23:19.500 --> 03:23:25.260
quickly surpassing the earlier numbers of the DS. And so, in their first year,

03:23:25.260 --> 03:23:30.540
the two systems seemed to be neck and neck, and attention then turned to the games.

03:23:31.580 --> 03:23:35.980
In the console market, Sony had always excelled at attracting third parties,

03:23:35.980 --> 03:23:41.100
but when it came to handhelds, they were still a newcomer, whereas Nintendo had been working

03:23:41.100 --> 03:23:47.340
with third parties on handheld games for many years. As a result, both systems received plenty

03:23:47.340 --> 03:23:54.380
of third-party support, but Sony no longer had the clear advantage. The PSP looked to continue

03:23:54.380 --> 03:23:59.020
the success of its less portable cousins through continuations of many of Sony's best-selling

03:23:59.020 --> 03:24:05.740
series. Its biggest success would be Grand 5th Auto Liberty City Stories, and this would be followed

03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:11.020
by a spin-off to Jack and Daxter, a new Tekken title with Dark Resurrection, a second Grand 5th

03:24:11.020 --> 03:24:16.540
Auto with Vice City Stories, multiple Metal Gear Solid titles with tactical card game Metal Gear

03:24:16.540 --> 03:24:22.460
Acid, and the more traditional Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, and a new Ratchet and Clank game

03:24:22.460 --> 03:24:28.300
in Size Matters. Later releases would see new entries into the Final Fantasy series with Crisis

03:24:28.300 --> 03:24:34.300
Core and Decidia, a Kingdom Hearts prequel with Birth by Sleep, entries into the Gran Turismo and

03:24:34.300 --> 03:24:40.140
God of War series, and several games from Capcom's new Monster Hunter series, which proved hugely

03:24:40.140 --> 03:24:46.220
popular in Japan. The PSP was further helped by the addition of a miniature analog stick,

03:24:46.220 --> 03:24:51.420
which was a feature the DS didn't have, which helped the PSP's reputation as a more serious

03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:58.060
gaming system. Meanwhile, over on the DS, there would also be continuations of popular series,

03:24:58.060 --> 03:25:04.140
with the first new 2D Mario since the Super Nintendo in New Super Mario Bros,

03:25:04.140 --> 03:25:11.980
as well as Mario Kart DS, a port of Super Mario 64, Animal Crossing Wildwood, Mario Party DS,

03:25:11.980 --> 03:25:18.380
and for Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass. However, alongside these more familiar names,

03:25:18.380 --> 03:25:23.020
the DS would also find success with several new series that were deliberately designed around

03:25:23.020 --> 03:25:28.860
the system's touchscreen. One of the most popular of these was Petsim, Nintendogs,

03:25:28.860 --> 03:25:35.180
which released early on and quickly became a big hit. But amongst the DS's best-selling games

03:25:35.180 --> 03:25:40.140
were a number of other names that didn't seem to resemble the usual gaming topsellers.

03:25:41.260 --> 03:25:48.380
These included Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, Professor Kakayama's Maths Training,

03:25:48.380 --> 03:25:55.260
the 100 Cell Calculation Method, Big Brain Academy, Flash Focus Vision Training in Minutes a Day,

03:25:55.820 --> 03:26:03.260
and English Training Have Fun Improving Your Skills. If you want to know just what a big deal

03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:08.940
Brain Age Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day was, all you need to know is that it sold more copies

03:26:08.940 --> 03:26:16.300
than any Pokemon game released on the DS. The game was inspired by a popular Japanese book,

03:26:16.300 --> 03:26:22.780
Train Your Brain 60 Days to a Better Brain, and after a new president of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata,

03:26:22.780 --> 03:26:27.260
met with the author, a decision was made to implement the book's thesis in a new game

03:26:27.260 --> 03:26:33.020
for Nintendo's upcoming handheld that they hoped might appeal to casual gamers. And it did.

03:26:34.060 --> 03:26:38.860
Nintendo released a number of semi-educational puzzle games over the DS's lifespan,

03:26:38.860 --> 03:26:42.300
and this became a major contributor to the success of its software sales.

03:26:42.300 --> 03:26:48.300
Sony targeted core gamers by doing something similar to its existing consoles and found

03:26:48.300 --> 03:26:54.140
success with the teenage and young adult markets, but Nintendo found considerable success with both

03:26:54.140 --> 03:26:59.660
younger and older demographics, including people who may not traditionally have had much experience

03:26:59.660 --> 03:27:05.660
with gaming. And so, just like with the design of their system, both companies had radically

03:27:05.660 --> 03:27:11.740
different approaches with their gaming lineups, and with time, one started to perform better than

03:27:11.740 --> 03:27:17.740
the other. The DS saw consistently stronger software sales and was able to maintain its

03:27:17.740 --> 03:27:24.300
momentum through a number of redesigns, starting with the DS Lite in 2006, then the DSi in early

03:27:24.300 --> 03:27:32.140
2009, and lastly with the DSi XO one year later. These redesigns weren't universally applauded,

03:27:32.140 --> 03:27:36.940
with the DSi's removal of backwards compatibility with Game Boy games and its introduction of

03:27:36.940 --> 03:27:42.220
digital cameras being seen as questionable, but the DS Lite in particular helped the console

03:27:42.220 --> 03:27:49.900
maintain sales. Meanwhile, the PSP also saw hardware updates with the PSP 2000 and 3000

03:27:49.900 --> 03:27:56.060
reducing the size and improving the screen, and the later PSP Go, providing a total model redesign

03:27:56.060 --> 03:28:01.660
alongside a move to digital only. Still, the Go retained the system's high price,

03:28:01.660 --> 03:28:06.940
and over time, interest in the PSP dwindled, while the DS pulled further and further ahead.

03:28:08.300 --> 03:28:13.020
This might be because while the PSP came close to matching the PS2's best titles in terms of

03:28:13.020 --> 03:28:17.660
graphics, its game still felt consistently inferior to their console inspirations.

03:28:18.780 --> 03:28:23.740
Early Metal Gear titles in particular seemed to mark a dropping quality, but even the PSP's

03:28:23.740 --> 03:28:28.060
best-selling Grand Theft Auto titles were still widely considered to be worse than the games

03:28:28.060 --> 03:28:34.060
which inspired them. Then, as the next generation of consoles arrived with high-definition graphics,

03:28:34.060 --> 03:28:39.580
the PSP's visuals were no longer quite so impressive, and with neither graphical prowess

03:28:39.580 --> 03:28:44.860
or must-have games to sell the system, and competition from newly arriving smartphones

03:28:44.860 --> 03:28:49.260
diminishing the PSP's role as a multimedia device, the system was left struggling.

03:28:50.540 --> 03:28:57.260
Meanwhile, the DS was different in both gameplay experiences and audience, and so it was able to

03:28:57.260 --> 03:29:02.940
maintain its more unique place within the gaming market over time. In the end, the Nintendo DS

03:29:02.940 --> 03:29:09.420
sold over 154 million units, making it the best-selling handheld and second best-selling

03:29:09.420 --> 03:29:15.980
system in history, only behind the PlayStation 2. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portable sold

03:29:15.980 --> 03:29:21.980
around 18 million units, making it an impressive debut by Sony even if it still ultimately fell

03:29:21.980 --> 03:29:28.140
well behind its competition. For handhelds overall, however, this may have been the greatest

03:29:28.140 --> 03:29:34.540
generation in gaming history, with record numbers of titles, genuine innovation from Nintendo,

03:29:34.540 --> 03:29:40.460
impressive power from Sony, and overall sales figures far beyond anything which came before

03:29:40.460 --> 03:29:47.020
or after. By the end of the decade, smartphones were well on their way, bringing the new frontier

03:29:47.020 --> 03:29:51.740
of mobile gaming with them and creating fresh competition for dedicated handheld systems.

03:29:52.780 --> 03:29:58.780
Still, for a while, the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable put handhelds on top of the gaming world,

03:29:59.420 --> 03:30:04.940
and with two very different systems to choose from, consumers were arguably the biggest winners

03:30:04.940 --> 03:30:11.580
of gaming's miniature console war. Nothing lasts forever though, and the arrival of mobile gaming

03:30:11.580 --> 03:30:17.020
would come to mark the beginning of the end for handhelds, and this wasn't the only part of the

03:30:17.020 --> 03:30:28.540
industry where things were changing. For many years, PC gaming had been a place of new innovations

03:30:28.540 --> 03:30:34.380
and independent development, but by the start of the 21st century, the divide between PC gaming

03:30:34.380 --> 03:30:41.100
and consoles wasn't quite so clear anymore. The PlayStation 1's use of PC-based development kits

03:30:41.100 --> 03:30:46.940
made porting between computers and consoles easier than ever, and as a result, many PC developers

03:30:46.940 --> 03:30:52.380
started to bring their games to consoles as well. This trend continued into the next generation,

03:30:52.380 --> 03:30:56.780
as all major console players now took the importance of porting and cross-platform games

03:30:56.780 --> 03:31:02.380
into consideration. At the same time, the console market had seen rapid growth since the launch

03:31:02.380 --> 03:31:08.060
of the PlayStation 1, making it a more lucrative market than ever, and then Microsoft entered

03:31:08.060 --> 03:31:13.740
the console space as well, making PC gaming and consoles even more closely connected.

03:31:14.940 --> 03:31:20.700
The result of all this was that PC gaming wasn't really as important in the 2000s as it was in

03:31:20.700 --> 03:31:25.740
the previous decades, and several notable PC developers started to design their games with

03:31:25.740 --> 03:31:33.340
consoles in mind, and maybe even as a priority. One of the best examples of this is Bioware,

03:31:33.420 --> 03:31:38.060
whose Baldur's Gate series had helped define the computer role-playing genre in the late 90s.

03:31:38.940 --> 03:31:44.940
Then, after another PC-focused RPG in Neverwinter Night since 2002, they made Star Wars Knights of

03:31:44.940 --> 03:31:51.020
the Old Republic for PC and Xbox, a game with a more console-focused design than earlier titles,

03:31:51.020 --> 03:31:57.500
and then their next two games, Jade Empire and Mass Effect, continued the console-focused design

03:31:57.500 --> 03:32:03.820
and released exclusively on Xbox and Xbox 360, while only later coming to PC.

03:32:05.260 --> 03:32:10.860
And so, while PC games did continue to release in this period, for developers, this was a time

03:32:10.860 --> 03:32:17.980
when consoles were often more important. The 2000s would also see certain classic PC gaming

03:32:17.980 --> 03:32:22.860
genres start to fall out of fashion, either because of changing consumer interests,

03:32:22.940 --> 03:32:27.980
or changing trends in game design, or just the impact of console growth over PC.

03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:35.020
Examples include point-and-click adventure games, dungeon crawlers, turn-based RPGs,

03:32:35.020 --> 03:32:39.820
arena shooters, certain simulation games, and even real-time strategy games.

03:32:41.020 --> 03:32:46.700
Some series that did see substantial PC success this decade include the already mentioned Sims,

03:32:46.700 --> 03:32:53.740
which received sequels in 2004 and 2009, the Total War series, which started with Shogun Total War

03:32:53.740 --> 03:33:00.060
in 2000 and received four more sequels over the next ten years, and the Civilization series,

03:33:00.060 --> 03:33:06.860
which saw its third entry in 2001 with further sequels in 2005 and 2010.

03:33:08.220 --> 03:33:14.060
Perhaps the PC's most standout release in this period was Valve's Half-Life 2 in 2004.

03:33:14.300 --> 03:33:19.260
Built on the studio's brand new source engine, its graphics alone were a whole generation ahead

03:33:19.260 --> 03:33:24.300
of anything on console at the time, and when combined with the engine's advanced new physics

03:33:24.300 --> 03:33:29.500
simulation, the game offered one of the most realistic and immersive experiences anyone had

03:33:29.500 --> 03:33:35.900
ever seen. Still, Half-Life 2 was more than just the graphical showcase. It used its new

03:33:35.900 --> 03:33:40.620
higher level of detail to craft effective environmental storytelling. Its physics were

03:33:41.580 --> 03:33:45.420
incorporated into puzzle design and allowed for the addition of a new gravity gun,

03:33:45.980 --> 03:33:51.420
and it combined varied gameplay, evocative worldbuilding, and an immersive, seamless story

03:33:51.420 --> 03:33:55.740
to create one of the most enduring single-player FPS experiences of all time.

03:33:56.940 --> 03:34:01.020
Half-Life 2 is one of the most highly acclaimed games of the 21st century,

03:34:01.020 --> 03:34:07.820
and it sold over 12 million copies. At a time when big PC exclusives seemed to be dying out,

03:34:07.900 --> 03:34:12.140
Half-Life 2 was a game which came to symbolize the system and its player base,

03:34:13.180 --> 03:34:16.460
even if it did still release on consoles a few years later.

03:34:17.580 --> 03:34:23.020
Still, even if the PC might have been past its golden age, there was one area where it continued

03:34:23.020 --> 03:34:27.580
to innovate, and it was an area which was only growing in importance.

03:34:28.940 --> 03:34:33.660
Online Online gaming may have started in the 90s,

03:34:33.660 --> 03:34:39.580
but the 2000s was when it exploded. The biggest contributor to this was the adoption of Broadband.

03:34:40.300 --> 03:34:46.940
In 2000, only 3% of American homes had Broadband, but by 2010, that number had increased to 66%,

03:34:47.820 --> 03:34:55.180
and Broadband meant convenient, high-speed internet access, which was perfect for playing online games.

03:34:55.420 --> 03:35:03.100
In 2001, Dynamix's Tribes 2 upped the scale of online shooters to a staggering 128 players

03:35:03.100 --> 03:35:11.260
in fast-paced jetpack-fuelled action. In 2002, EA's Battlefield 1942 offered a rather different

03:35:11.260 --> 03:35:16.860
kind of large-scale multiplayer warfare with up to 64 players in an impressive simulation

03:35:16.860 --> 03:35:24.300
of a realistic battle. Alongside EA's Medal of Honor and Activision's Call of Duty in 2003,

03:35:25.020 --> 03:35:29.180
these three series established the modern military shooter, something that would play a

03:35:29.180 --> 03:35:35.340
massive part in the gaming industry for years to come. In 2004, Valve released Counter-Strike

03:35:35.340 --> 03:35:40.940
Source, ensuring the popular round-based shooter continued to stay relevant, and in 2007,

03:35:40.940 --> 03:35:46.380
Valve released Team Fortress 2, a class and objective-based FPS that has continued to

03:35:46.380 --> 03:35:52.140
remain active and popular to this day. Online shooters were making their way to consoles

03:35:52.140 --> 03:35:57.900
as early as Unreal Championship in 2002, but for many people, PC was still the best place to

03:35:57.900 --> 03:36:04.060
experience them, with custom matchmaking, dedicated servers, and loyal communities all shaping an

03:36:04.060 --> 03:36:10.300
experience unlike the one on the more tightly controlled consoles. But online gaming wasn't

03:36:10.300 --> 03:36:15.420
just about shooting other people. One of the biggest trends of the decade was the growth of

03:36:15.420 --> 03:36:22.940
massively multiplayer online RPGs, with games like Dark Age of Camelot, RuneScape, Ragnarok Online,

03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:27.980
Final Fantasy XI, and Star Wars Galaxies all following on from what Ultima Online and EverQuest

03:36:27.980 --> 03:36:34.220
started in the late 90s. Still, when it came to MMOs, there was one game which reigned supreme

03:36:34.220 --> 03:36:41.660
over all others. Released in late 2004, World of Warcraft took Blizzard's popular fantasy series

03:36:41.660 --> 03:36:48.700
online in a massive way. With a staggeringly large open world, distinct factions, classes,

03:36:48.700 --> 03:36:54.140
and races, and more attention than previous MMOs to accessibility and leveling, World of Warcraft

03:36:54.140 --> 03:37:00.780
quickly became hugely popular. By 2010, it was well into its second expansion and had over 12

03:37:00.780 --> 03:37:07.580
million concurrent subscribers, all paying monthly fees. In a time before microtransactions,

03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:13.500
loot boxes, or DLC, this represented a serious amount of continuous income on a scale which

03:37:13.500 --> 03:37:20.140
the gaming industry had never really seen before. 12 million players also meant a serious amount of

03:37:20.140 --> 03:37:26.540
time was being invested into Warcraft's virtual world. As more and more players followed, the

03:37:26.540 --> 03:37:32.780
reputation of a genre as something life-consuming, addictive, and dangerous grew as those outside

03:37:32.780 --> 03:37:38.700
the gaming community tried to make sense of this new, growing phenomenon. In reality, some of the

03:37:38.700 --> 03:37:44.460
panic this led to was overblown, but there was an element of truth to it as well. For some people,

03:37:44.460 --> 03:37:51.020
MMOs really were addictive. The escapist promised of another world to lose yourself in, the competitive

03:37:51.020 --> 03:37:55.580
nature of player-vs-player combat and end-game raiding, and the social bonds that come from

03:37:55.580 --> 03:38:00.460
spending so much time with other players in a shared world all contributed to an experience

03:38:00.460 --> 03:38:06.380
still new to many people that could provide hours of fun, but could also be hard to turn away from.

03:38:08.140 --> 03:38:13.340
World of Warcraft would be followed by many other MMOs, most of which took heavy inspiration from its

03:38:13.340 --> 03:38:19.020
success, but in the end, the genre's growth didn't last, and rather than going on to conquer the

03:38:19.020 --> 03:38:24.620
entire gaming world, the genre instead seemed to peak at the decade's end as more and more online

03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:30.300
games started to emerge. For a time, however, World of Warcraft really did stand at the top of the

03:38:30.300 --> 03:38:37.180
gaming world, and it became an important part of 2000's gaming culture in the process. Still,

03:38:37.180 --> 03:38:42.380
while World of Warcraft might have been the biggest online game of the 2000s, it certainly wasn't the

03:38:42.380 --> 03:38:48.300
only one that left a lasting mark on the industry, and in fact, it wasn't even the only one to come

03:38:48.300 --> 03:38:56.220
from the Warcraft series. Warcraft 3 released in 2002, and was an important online game in its

03:38:56.220 --> 03:39:00.780
own right, with an active modding and competitive scene that were aided by the game's inclusion

03:39:00.780 --> 03:39:06.540
of a world editor. This allowed players to create custom scenarios or maps for the game,

03:39:06.540 --> 03:39:12.220
and many of these found popularity online, but one map in particular would go a whole lot further.

03:39:13.180 --> 03:39:17.820
Defense of the Ancients took inspiration from an earlier custom map in Starcraft,

03:39:17.820 --> 03:39:23.100
and shifted Warcraft's more traditional RTS focus towards hero vs hero action.

03:39:24.380 --> 03:39:29.500
Dota proved to be a big hit, and would continue to get updated over the course of the decade,

03:39:29.500 --> 03:39:34.460
with a dedicated community being built around its competitive play, which soon started appearing

03:39:34.460 --> 03:39:40.380
at esport events. By the end of the decade, Dota was starting to attract serious commercial

03:39:40.460 --> 03:39:47.100
attention, and in 2009, one of its original developers, alongside the recently formed Riot Games,

03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:52.940
would launch their own take on a standalone Dota-like experience called League of Legends.

03:39:54.220 --> 03:39:59.980
In time, the genre's name would change from Dota-like to MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle

03:39:59.980 --> 03:40:05.580
Arena, and in a little more time, this would become one of the most popular genres in the world.

03:40:06.540 --> 03:40:14.140
And it all started with a single custom map for Warcraft 3. Counter-Strike and Team Fortress

03:40:14.140 --> 03:40:19.180
were also games which started life as player-created mods, and between them, they proved that the

03:40:19.180 --> 03:40:24.460
innovative and independent side of PC gaming, where developers could change the entire industry with

03:40:24.460 --> 03:40:31.260
a few lines of code written in their bedroom, was still alive, even in the console-dominated 2000s.

03:40:32.220 --> 03:40:38.540
And speaking of console domination, the mid-2000s also brought the arrival of a new generation

03:40:38.540 --> 03:40:43.020
alongside the greatest fall from grace since the collapse of Atari.

03:40:48.780 --> 03:40:53.260
With the PlayStation 2, Sony achieved the unthinkable, and they were set to enter the

03:40:53.260 --> 03:40:58.940
7th generation of consoles with a huge lead in market share and a near flawless reputation

03:40:59.180 --> 03:41:04.780
with the public. One year after the release of their next system, however, they would find

03:41:04.780 --> 03:41:10.700
themselves firmly in last place in sales while making a significant loss on each unit sold,

03:41:10.700 --> 03:41:14.780
with onlookers questioning if they were witnessing the beginning of the end

03:41:14.780 --> 03:41:21.740
of the once-immortal PlayStation. For 10 years, Sony dominated the console market

03:41:21.740 --> 03:41:27.100
without any competitor coming close. For 10 years, they looked unbeatable.

03:41:28.140 --> 03:41:30.860
Until, suddenly, things changed.

03:41:32.780 --> 03:41:39.980
The story of how this happened began at E3 2005. For years, gamers the world over had been

03:41:39.980 --> 03:41:44.380
eagerly awaiting the next generation of gaming, and it was here that they were finally going to

03:41:44.380 --> 03:41:50.460
get to see it, with Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo showing off their new consoles officially for the

03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:57.500
very first time. For Nintendo, the reveal was still rather secretive. The console was named

03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:01.900
The Revolution, due to Nintendo's belief that it would revolutionize the industry,

03:42:01.900 --> 03:42:07.180
but the reason for that revolution wasn't yet made clear, and other than a look at the prototype

03:42:07.180 --> 03:42:11.900
model, some technical details, and a brief showing of some next-generation Metroid,

03:42:11.900 --> 03:42:15.100
the audience was ultimately left with more questions than answers.

03:42:15.500 --> 03:42:22.540
For Microsoft, the event meant details. The already-announced Xbox 360 was set to launch

03:42:22.540 --> 03:42:27.020
later that year ahead of its competition, and Microsoft showed off upcoming games,

03:42:27.020 --> 03:42:31.820
provided technical specifications, and emphasized the new online interconnectivity,

03:42:31.820 --> 03:42:36.460
with in-game messaging, downloadable games, and further online support being planned.

03:42:37.740 --> 03:42:43.260
Sony, however, wasn't as close to their console's release date, and so the event came to be about

03:42:43.500 --> 03:42:51.260
the future. Sony's main announcement was the Cell multi-core microprocessor that would be powering

03:42:51.260 --> 03:42:57.900
their new upcoming system. This was being built in collaboration with IBM and Toshiba, and used

03:42:57.900 --> 03:43:03.340
genuine supercomputer technology, making it a promising piece of hardware that could put Sony's

03:43:03.340 --> 03:43:09.820
system a clear step above its competition in terms of pure power. Sony spent far longer showcasing

03:43:09.820 --> 03:43:15.420
the Cell processor than any company would normally spend on such a subject, with both tech demos

03:43:15.420 --> 03:43:22.540
and games designed to show off its capabilities. Some of what was shown was genuinely mind-blowing.

03:43:23.340 --> 03:43:27.740
It can be hard to tell on lower-resolution video footage after years of further technological

03:43:27.740 --> 03:43:33.980
advances, but for the time, the quality of certain games was far beyond anything people had seen

03:43:33.980 --> 03:43:40.700
before, beyond Microsoft's recent 360 showcase, and beyond what many people thought was even possible.

03:43:41.900 --> 03:43:46.860
For example, Killzone featured animations, physics, and lighting effects that are still

03:43:46.860 --> 03:43:53.020
difficult to achieve today, 18 years later, including explosions casting shadows in real time.

03:43:54.220 --> 03:43:59.020
For people who knew a little about gaming hardware, this could only mean one of two

03:43:59.020 --> 03:44:03.580
possibilities, and arguments were quick to break out online about which one was true.

03:44:04.780 --> 03:44:09.340
Either Sony was about to obliterate the competition and dominate a third console

03:44:09.340 --> 03:44:16.300
generation in a row with their far superior system, or the games shown were fake,

03:44:17.580 --> 03:44:23.340
i.e pre-rendered videos that were only posing as games, or at best actual games that were

03:44:23.340 --> 03:44:30.620
instead running on top-of-the-line PC hardware. In the end, time would tell, but not before the

03:44:30.620 --> 03:44:41.500
Xbox 360 launched. The 360 released in November 2005 at $299 or $399, depending on model,

03:44:41.500 --> 03:44:47.740
and it received a positive critical reception. Sales started strong, but manufacturing problems

03:44:47.740 --> 03:44:52.860
limited supply, leading to the system selling out in all regions except Japan, while not

03:44:52.860 --> 03:44:58.780
selling as many units as was originally hoped. The launch lineup was nothing remarkable,

03:44:58.780 --> 03:45:04.140
with Call of Duty 2 and Perfect Dark Zero being the best selling titles, yet Niber represented

03:45:04.140 --> 03:45:11.100
a true system seller. And so, with one console released, the field was wide open, with everything

03:45:11.100 --> 03:45:18.220
still to play for. 2006 saw the PlayStation 3 being delayed from its earlier release date of spring

03:45:18.220 --> 03:45:24.060
to later in the year, while the 360 continued strong, adding more exclusive games to its library,

03:45:24.060 --> 03:45:29.900
including the Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion, Dead Rising, and Saints Row. Meanwhile,

03:45:29.900 --> 03:45:36.620
E3 that year brought Nintendo's big reveal, and reactions were mixed. The new name, The We,

03:45:36.620 --> 03:45:41.980
was widely mocked, and the showcasing of the new motion controls left audiences uncertain.

03:45:42.940 --> 03:45:48.140
For Nintendo and the gaming industry, this was a bold new direction, and no one seemed quite

03:45:48.140 --> 03:45:54.300
sure yet what the impact of this would be. One thing it did make clear, however, was that Nintendo

03:45:54.300 --> 03:45:58.460
wouldn't be in the competition for the most powerful next-gen system anymore, and would

03:45:58.460 --> 03:46:06.220
instead be finding success or failure through forging their own path. And so, attention returned to

03:46:06.220 --> 03:46:11.020
Sony, who were about to have a conference that would live in infamy ever since.

03:46:11.820 --> 03:46:15.820
Our development teams all around the world, in all of our studios,

03:46:15.820 --> 03:46:21.100
have been hard at work converting that technology and vision into magic.

03:46:25.580 --> 03:46:31.820
Whoops. Another exciting aspect is the ability for consumers to make microtransactions, 599 US

03:46:31.820 --> 03:46:36.220
dollars, and we've been digging deeper and discovering what kind of muscle this machine really has.

03:46:39.420 --> 03:46:43.500
And you can see from all of the games that we have up and running on PlayStation 3 that we're

03:46:43.500 --> 03:46:50.940
really starting to push what this machine is capable of. Real-time weapon change, it's exhilarating.

03:46:53.820 --> 03:46:57.340
What they're creating for the PlayStation 3 is inspiring.

03:47:00.300 --> 03:47:07.660
So, that sums up our playable section. When E3 began in the 90s, it was something

03:47:07.660 --> 03:47:12.540
aimed primarily at investors and industry professionals, and it came alongside boring

03:47:12.540 --> 03:47:19.260
PowerPoint presentations full of sales figures and bar charts. As time went by, E3 became more and

03:47:19.260 --> 03:47:24.620
more about media coverage and consumer outreach, with it becoming the number one place to make

03:47:24.620 --> 03:47:32.460
gaming announcements, while also drawing heavy consumer scrutiny. By 2006, E3 was starting to

03:47:32.460 --> 03:47:37.820
attract more consumer attention, and Sony's presentation wasn't exactly convincing.

03:47:38.700 --> 03:47:43.900
Making fun of E3 conferences has gone on to become a recurring part of online gaming culture,

03:47:44.540 --> 03:47:47.260
but this was where that tradition started.

03:47:47.820 --> 03:47:49.660
And we're certainly not interested in gimmicks.

03:47:49.660 --> 03:47:57.260
So, you can position this next to your TV screen and see for yourself what is coming up behind you.

03:47:57.260 --> 03:47:59.580
And we're certainly not interested in conventional thinking.

03:48:00.540 --> 03:48:06.860
Genji 2 is an ashen game, which is based on Japanese history. The stages of the game will

03:48:06.860 --> 03:48:11.900
also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.

03:48:13.580 --> 03:48:16.220
So, here's this giant enemy crab.

03:48:16.220 --> 03:48:24.460
It's Ridge Racer. Ridge Racer. It requires huge financial investment, 599 US dollars,

03:48:24.460 --> 03:48:28.060
but we must take risks to reap the rewards.

03:48:28.060 --> 03:48:33.580
Still, as the dust settled, on-stage awkwardness and giant enemy crabs were the least of Sony's

03:48:33.580 --> 03:48:40.860
worries. A retail price of 599 dollars, or 499 for a model with a smaller hard drive

03:48:40.860 --> 03:48:46.780
and several missing features, was a staggering amount of money, well beyond the competition,

03:48:46.780 --> 03:48:48.300
or what anyone expected.

03:48:49.500 --> 03:48:54.060
The system would include a Blu-ray player, which helped Sony promote the Blu-ray format,

03:48:54.060 --> 03:48:59.740
but unlike the DVD player of the PS2, for most consumers, this did little to make up for the

03:48:59.740 --> 03:49:04.060
system's high price, as the Blu-ray format was still rarely being used at the time.

03:49:05.180 --> 03:49:09.580
Sony, however, justified the high price on the basis that the power of their system

03:49:09.580 --> 03:49:16.300
made it worth it. They were Sony, they made the best consoles, and the higher price was

03:49:16.300 --> 03:49:21.980
reflective of their far more powerful hardware. Sony didn't see the problem with this logic,

03:49:22.700 --> 03:49:24.060
but other people did.

03:49:24.380 --> 03:49:29.820
Alongside the price, release date, and lessons on Japanese history, Sony also showcased several

03:49:29.820 --> 03:49:34.780
upcoming games, yet most of them didn't look as impressive as what Sony had shown the year

03:49:34.780 --> 03:49:39.500
before. What's more, they also didn't look especially different to the already released

03:49:39.500 --> 03:49:46.060
games on the Xbox 360. Sony did have a more powerful system, but it seemed they didn't

03:49:46.060 --> 03:49:52.060
have much to show for it. Of course, some people disagreed with arguments ranging online about

03:49:53.020 --> 03:49:57.100
the console's graphics, and people possibly seeing whatever they wanted to see.

03:49:58.380 --> 03:50:05.100
In the end, time would once more tell the true story, and in November 2006, the PlayStation 3

03:50:05.100 --> 03:50:10.300
released in America and Japan, with a last-minute delay leading to the European release being

03:50:10.300 --> 03:50:18.060
pushed to early 2007. Regardless of the price, the system did still sell, with stock shortages

03:50:18.060 --> 03:50:24.220
and online scalpers causing controversy. The PS3 launch lineup also didn't have too much to offer,

03:50:24.220 --> 03:50:28.460
and featured fewer games than the 360 had at release, with the best-selling game being

03:50:28.460 --> 03:50:34.540
Resistance Full of Man. Still, by this point, the Xbox 360 had been out for a year already,

03:50:34.540 --> 03:50:39.660
and in that time, its library had grown considerably, with the month of the PS3's launch

03:50:39.660 --> 03:50:45.500
just happening to coincide with Microsoft's latest big exclusive, Gears of War, a third-person

03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:51.980
shooter from Epic Games. Gears was a major critical and commercial hit. Its heavy focus on

03:50:51.980 --> 03:50:56.780
cover-based combat was seen as a fresh take on the shooter genre, and it was the perfect game to

03:50:56.780 --> 03:51:03.660
fill a space left open by the 360's absence of a new halo. What's more, its Unreal Engine-powered

03:51:03.660 --> 03:51:09.740
graphics wowed critics and showcased what the 360 was capable of, and it seemed that what the 360

03:51:09.740 --> 03:51:15.500
was capable of was keeping up with the supposedly more powerful PlayStation 3.

03:51:16.940 --> 03:51:22.460
Of course, arguments about graphics still raged online, but by this point, for most people,

03:51:22.460 --> 03:51:27.100
it was clear that if the PS3 did have an advantage, it wasn't a big enough one to win

03:51:27.100 --> 03:51:33.420
them the console generation outright. At this point, you may be wondering what the hell was

03:51:33.420 --> 03:51:39.260
going on inside the PlayStation 3, and whether the system even was more powerful to begin with,

03:51:40.060 --> 03:51:43.660
and this was a question many people asked throughout the seventh generation.

03:51:44.700 --> 03:51:50.700
The simple answer is that the cell processor famously used by the PS3 was more powerful,

03:51:50.700 --> 03:51:56.300
but it was also more complicated, which made it harder for developers to actually utilize its power.

03:51:57.500 --> 03:52:03.580
Meanwhile, the 360 had a solid CPU itself, while also having a small edge when it came to GPU power

03:52:03.580 --> 03:52:09.260
and a more convenient shared memory system. In the end, though, any difference in power

03:52:09.260 --> 03:52:13.260
didn't really matter. The key decider was third parties.

03:52:14.620 --> 03:52:18.860
Sony hoped that they'd continue to lead the industry, and that developers would prioritize

03:52:18.860 --> 03:52:25.260
developing for their more powerful system as a result. In reality, however, the Xbox 360 quickly

03:52:25.260 --> 03:52:30.380
gained a sizable share of the market, and so developers' priority became making sure their

03:52:30.380 --> 03:52:35.660
games were available on both systems, with some developers even going as far as to publicly

03:52:35.660 --> 03:52:42.780
criticize Sony's more difficult to develop for hardware. But as the 360 was easier to develop

03:52:42.780 --> 03:52:48.940
for, most multi-platform games were developed primarily for the Xbox 360 and then ported to the

03:52:48.940 --> 03:52:55.500
PS3, meaning not only did the PlayStation 3 lack a graphical advantage, but in many multi-platform

03:52:55.500 --> 03:53:03.180
games the PlayStation version either looked or ran worse. The PS3 did produce some great looking

03:53:03.180 --> 03:53:08.060
exclusives, particularly later in its life once developers had more time to get used to the system's

03:53:08.060 --> 03:53:13.580
architecture. But its reputation for having inferior versions of multi-platform games,

03:53:13.580 --> 03:53:17.180
at a time when multi-platform games were becoming more important,

03:53:17.180 --> 03:53:22.060
did damage the system's sales, with Microsoft often seeing much better software sales for

03:53:22.060 --> 03:53:28.860
multi-platform titles. It also damaged Sony's brand, and without a graphical edge or many

03:53:29.100 --> 03:53:35.340
exclusive games early in its life, the PlayStation 3 fell behind the 360, while the Xbox's library

03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:41.980
continued to grow. 2007 brought more exclusives to Microsoft's system, including Crackdown,

03:53:41.980 --> 03:53:48.780
Forza Motorsports 2, BioShock, and Mass Effect. The biggest of these, though, was the much

03:53:48.780 --> 03:53:55.020
anticipated Halo 3, which promised players the chance to finish the fight in what was to be

03:53:55.020 --> 03:54:01.980
Master Chief's final game. Halo was huge. It went on to sell over 14 million copies

03:54:01.980 --> 03:54:06.140
in what many considered to be the best game of the 7th generation up until that point.

03:54:07.260 --> 03:54:11.980
Sony would have some exclusives of their own that year, but the likes of a new Ratchet & Clank,

03:54:11.980 --> 03:54:17.500
Uncharted Drake's Fortune, and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue weren't enough to match the 360's

03:54:17.500 --> 03:54:22.620
superior offerings. What's more, many of the series that once made the PlayStation,

03:54:22.620 --> 03:54:30.300
the console king, were going, or had already went, multi-platform. From Grand Theft Auto to Devil

03:54:30.300 --> 03:54:36.220
May Cry, Tomb Raider, or Tekken, Sony's list of exclusives seemed to be getting smaller and smaller,

03:54:36.220 --> 03:54:43.100
and at E3 2008, it was announced that even Final Fantasy, a series more important to Sony's early

03:54:43.100 --> 03:54:49.900
success than any other, would be coming to both systems. Microsoft did face some of their own

03:54:49.900 --> 03:54:55.580
problems, the most expensive being high rates of hardware failure, and the infamous Red Ring of

03:54:55.580 --> 03:55:01.740
Death. Reports of technical problems appeared early in the 360's life, but the true extent of the

03:55:01.740 --> 03:55:06.780
issue wasn't made apparent until a year or two after its launch, as more and more systems continued

03:55:06.780 --> 03:55:13.100
to fail. In the end, Microsoft was forced to make an official response to the situation, alongside

03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:20.540
offering all Xbox owners a full three-year warranty covering repairs and shipping. This was estimated

03:55:20.540 --> 03:55:26.140
to cost over $1 billion, and slowed the Xbox's momentum at a time when Microsoft would have

03:55:26.140 --> 03:55:32.540
loved to instead have been pulling further ahead. As the decade grew to a close, the PlayStation

03:55:32.540 --> 03:55:39.740
3's outlook was finally starting to look more positive. Consecutive $100 price cuts in 2007,

03:55:39.740 --> 03:55:48.380
2008, and 2009 finally brought the system to an affordable price. Several early 360 exclusives,

03:55:48.380 --> 03:55:54.140
like the Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion and Bioshock, turned out to only have timed exclusivity and

03:55:54.140 --> 03:55:59.420
made their way to Sony's system as well. And as the generation continued, the PlayStation 3 was

03:55:59.420 --> 03:56:05.180
able to add more and more exclusives of its own, including LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid 4,

03:56:05.740 --> 03:56:14.460
Killzone 2, Infamous, God of War 3, and Gran Turismo 5. Meanwhile, the exclusives on the 360

03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:20.780
started to come slower, with highlights including Fable 2, Left 4 Dead, and sequels to Halo and

03:56:20.780 --> 03:56:27.420
Gears of War. The decade would end with Microsoft still in the lead, but with Sony working hard to

03:56:27.420 --> 03:56:32.540
make amends for their mistakes by taking heavy losses on systems sold after price cuts as they

03:56:32.540 --> 03:56:37.660
tried to foster an image of appealing to core gamers and creating strong first-party titles.

03:56:39.020 --> 03:56:44.620
Still, for Microsoft, the seventh generation can only be interpreted as victory, whereas for Sony,

03:56:44.620 --> 03:56:50.060
they went from being untouchable to having to fight for their life. When Sony launched the

03:56:50.060 --> 03:56:55.500
PlayStation 1, they found record success through the system's affordable price, its ease to develop

03:56:55.500 --> 03:57:01.820
for, and its great third-party support that led to many exclusive titles. Ten years later,

03:57:01.820 --> 03:57:06.380
they seem to have ignored all of these factors and were instead relying on name recognition to

03:57:06.380 --> 03:57:11.340
sell their system no matter the price, and to bring developers to their side no matter the

03:57:11.340 --> 03:57:17.340
challenge of development. Yet, while it might seem like Sony's downfall was brought about by

03:57:17.340 --> 03:57:23.820
arrogance, it might be fairer to say that they were simply over-ambitious. The man responsible

03:57:23.820 --> 03:57:29.740
for many of the decisions involving the PlayStation 3 was then Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO

03:57:29.740 --> 03:57:36.300
Ken Kutaragi, who is sometimes described as the father of PlayStation. For Kutaragi,

03:57:36.300 --> 03:57:40.780
this was to be his last direct involvement with Sony's gaming division, which was something he

03:57:40.780 --> 03:57:47.260
had once done so much to help create, and he truly believed in the power of the cell processor and

03:57:47.260 --> 03:57:53.740
had hopes its technology could be used in other Sony products. In the end, this wasn't to be,

03:57:53.740 --> 03:57:59.260
but Kutaragi had taken gambles with the PlayStation 1 and 2 as well, and in the past,

03:57:59.260 --> 03:58:02.940
this was a big part of what helped turn Sony into the leader of the industry.

03:58:03.980 --> 03:58:09.900
This time, however, he simply got it wrong. Still, Sony weren't the only ones who took

03:58:09.900 --> 03:58:15.740
a gamble in the 7th generation, and while the PS3 and 360 were in fierce competition for the

03:58:15.740 --> 03:58:19.980
core gaming market, Nintendo were finding success elsewhere.

03:58:20.940 --> 03:58:27.500
The Wii wasn't like its peers.

03:58:28.540 --> 03:58:34.140
Where Sony and Microsoft moved to high definition, Nintendo's system remained at the 480p of the

03:58:34.140 --> 03:58:38.940
previous generation, breaking the long-running convention of new consoles being more powerful

03:58:38.940 --> 03:58:45.100
than their predecessors. Instead, Nintendo opted to avoid direct competition and to target a broader

03:58:45.100 --> 03:58:51.660
demographic in what has sometimes been called the Blue Ocean business strategy, which asserts

03:58:51.660 --> 03:58:58.140
finding value in less contested market spaces. To this end, Nintendo set out with the goal to

03:58:58.140 --> 03:59:03.500
innovate, taking inspiration from the success of the Nintendo DS, as well as the popular arcade

03:59:03.500 --> 03:59:08.460
rhythm game, Dance Dance Revolution, and new advancements in motion sensing technology.

03:59:08.620 --> 03:59:14.860
The end result released in November 2006, mere days after the PlayStation 3.

03:59:15.740 --> 03:59:23.020
Unlike the PS3, however, the Wii cost the mere $250, and it quickly sold out, beating the combined

03:59:23.020 --> 03:59:27.740
sales of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in most regions during its launch.

03:59:29.020 --> 03:59:34.300
The Wii offered something genuinely new, and people seemed eager to try it out for themselves.

03:59:35.260 --> 03:59:41.100
By September 2007, the Wii had overtaken the 360, despite releasing a year later,

03:59:41.100 --> 03:59:45.980
and it continued to sell well in 2010 when it started to experience a rapid decline

03:59:45.980 --> 03:59:51.900
amidst increased competition. For many people though, the Wii was the perfect family console.

03:59:52.860 --> 03:59:57.340
Its advertising targeted a wide audience, including mothers and grandmothers,

03:59:57.340 --> 04:00:02.300
and its wealth of party games and simple pickup and playability led to many people who may not

04:00:02.380 --> 04:00:08.380
have usually played video games being willing to give it a go. Its best-selling titles reflect

04:00:08.380 --> 04:00:15.500
this broader appeal, with the bundled Wii Sports selling and impressive 82.9 million copies.

04:00:16.620 --> 04:00:21.180
Wii Sports didn't receive the strongest critical reception, mostly due to the gameplay's lack of

04:00:21.180 --> 04:00:26.460
depth, but its simplicity worked well as an introduction to motion control and as a way to

04:00:26.460 --> 04:00:33.660
attract those new to gaming. Other new first-party motion control games like Wii Play, Wii Fit,

04:00:33.660 --> 04:00:39.260
Wii Party, and Wii Sports Resort also sold impressive numbers, with Nintendo managing

04:00:39.260 --> 04:00:44.300
to showcase various creative ways to use their new technology, particularly through the combination

04:00:44.300 --> 04:00:50.780
of exercise and gaming in Wii Fit. Alongside these were many of the classic series people

04:00:50.780 --> 04:00:56.220
have come to expect from Nintendo, with Mario Kart Wii and new Super Mario Bros Wii being the

04:00:56.220 --> 04:01:02.300
best-selling titles, and Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Smash Bros Brawl,

04:01:02.300 --> 04:01:05.900
and for Legends of Zelda Twilight Princess being its most highly acclaimed.

04:01:07.100 --> 04:01:12.220
Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 stood out in particular for once more offering a fresh take on the 3D

04:01:12.220 --> 04:01:17.420
Mario formula, this time with a space theme and lots of creative level design focused on

04:01:17.420 --> 04:01:23.100
different uses of gravity. Much of the Wii's library focused on its motion controls however,

04:01:23.100 --> 04:01:28.780
and on this aspect opinions varied, with some seeing it as a bold new step for gaming and

04:01:28.780 --> 04:01:34.460
others seeing it as more of an imprecise gimmick. The legacy of the Wii is also hard to judge.

04:01:35.180 --> 04:01:40.140
It was the best-selling system of its generation, and yet in its later years its sales fell

04:01:40.140 --> 04:01:46.300
consistently behind both its rivals in hardware and software, and this severe loss of momentum

04:01:46.300 --> 04:01:51.340
may have went on to hurt Nintendo's next console. For a time it looked like the system

04:01:51.340 --> 04:01:56.780
would live up to its early codename, but in the end the motion control revolution didn't really

04:01:56.780 --> 04:02:01.900
amount to much, suggesting that the success of the system might have been more down to novelty

04:02:01.900 --> 04:02:07.340
than the inherent value that motion control provided. There were also problems beyond the

04:02:07.340 --> 04:02:13.420
system's less impressive graphics, with poor online support, poor audio, and a plethora of

04:02:13.420 --> 04:02:18.460
lower quality titles that seemed designed to purely cash in on the latest craze with little

04:02:18.460 --> 04:02:24.780
regard to quality. This came alongside a lack of long-term third-party support from more established

04:02:24.780 --> 04:02:29.820
video game developers, who often stated they found motion controls difficult to implement and develop

04:02:29.820 --> 04:02:35.660
for. The Wii would also miss out on many multi-platform games due to the difficulty of porting to a

04:02:35.660 --> 04:02:42.220
system with lower technical specifications. Yet at the same time, the Nintendo Wii was one of the

04:02:42.220 --> 04:02:48.380
most unique and daring consoles the gaming industry has ever seen, and it remains an iconic part of

04:02:48.380 --> 04:02:55.340
gaming in the 2000s. And while motion controls may not have been the future for mainstream gaming,

04:02:55.900 --> 04:03:02.860
appealing to wider demographics may well have been. The 2000s would see another trend come and go

04:03:02.860 --> 04:03:08.860
in the form of accessory-based rhythm games. Across different systems and different titles,

04:03:08.860 --> 04:03:15.020
the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series saw hugely impressive sales, and while this sub-genre soon

04:03:15.020 --> 04:03:19.980
fell away, this was around the same time but smartphones and mobile gaming were starting

04:03:19.980 --> 04:03:25.420
to explode and conquer the casual market as well as a big chunk of the entire industry in the process.

04:03:26.860 --> 04:03:30.620
In this sense, the Wii may have been ahead of its time in making inroads

04:03:30.620 --> 04:03:37.180
into new, more casual audiences. But it would soon find itself outgunned in the great casual war

04:03:37.180 --> 04:03:42.620
by the rapidly growing mobile market. Mobile gaming wasn't the only thing on the rise at

04:03:42.620 --> 04:03:47.020
the end of the decade, however, as while console gaming was increasingly going big,

04:03:47.660 --> 04:03:50.860
some developers started to take a rather different approach.

04:03:57.340 --> 04:04:03.180
The 2000s can be seen as the decade where AAA gaming came to dominate, with bigger budgets,

04:04:03.260 --> 04:04:08.540
better graphics and longer development cycles at the same time that certain styles or genres of

04:04:08.540 --> 04:04:14.780
games were increasingly being pushed out of the limelight. But in the shadow of this increased

04:04:14.780 --> 04:04:20.300
focus on blockbuster titles at the expense of all else, something else started to appear in the

04:04:20.300 --> 04:04:26.460
decade's second half. Independent game development had long played a vital role in PC gaming,

04:04:27.420 --> 04:04:32.380
from pioneering students in the 70s to bedroom coders in the 80s to shareware

04:04:32.380 --> 04:04:36.860
successes in the 90s and even modding innovations at the turn of the decade,

04:04:36.860 --> 04:04:41.100
independent development was around since the industry's beginning, and it never stopped

04:04:41.100 --> 04:04:47.740
being important. Still, throughout the 90s and 2000s, the technological gap between what small

04:04:47.740 --> 04:04:54.060
independent teams and big commercial studios could do grew and grew, moving the industry

04:04:54.060 --> 04:04:59.740
further and further away from independent development. In the early 2000s, however,

04:04:59.820 --> 04:05:03.740
several factors would align that helped give rise to a new form of indie game development.

04:05:04.780 --> 04:05:09.580
The first was the internet, which paved the way for more effective online distribution

04:05:09.580 --> 04:05:15.180
without the need for retailers or publishers. The internet also saw the start of browser-based

04:05:15.180 --> 04:05:21.660
gaming, which was made possible through programs like Java and Adobe Flash. This would give rise

04:05:21.660 --> 04:05:26.620
to a wealth of user-generated content, with hosting sites like Newgrounds seeing massive

04:05:26.620 --> 04:05:32.060
amounts of traffic over the decades, proving the popularity of even much more limited games,

04:05:32.060 --> 04:05:37.820
with some browser-based games quickly becoming successful enough to get full PC retail releases,

04:05:37.820 --> 04:05:45.900
like with PopCap's 2001 match 3 game Bejewelled. At the same time as this, new dedicated software

04:05:45.900 --> 04:05:52.780
like Game Maker Studio and new unified game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine were starting to lower

04:05:52.780 --> 04:05:59.580
the programming barrier to entry in game development. Finally, in 2004 Half-Life 2 released,

04:05:59.580 --> 04:06:07.100
and indie gaming would never be the same. Because despite being very far from an indie game itself,

04:06:07.100 --> 04:06:12.700
Half-Life 2 was the first game to be offered on and required the installation of Steam.

04:06:14.220 --> 04:06:19.420
The Half-Life community wasn't exactly happy about this, but the Half-Life community didn't

04:06:19.420 --> 04:06:27.100
have a choice, and Half-Life 2 was a difficult game to resist. In 2005, Steam would release its first

04:06:27.100 --> 04:06:32.620
third-party games on the platform, including independent titles like Ragdoll Kong Fu and

04:06:32.620 --> 04:06:39.660
Darwinia. And as Steam's digital distribution model cut out retailers and manufacturing costs,

04:06:39.660 --> 04:06:44.780
it gave developers a higher profit margin, meaning that once Valve proved the model could work,

04:06:44.780 --> 04:06:50.620
they were able to start attracting bigger names, including id Software, Idos and Capcom,

04:06:50.620 --> 04:06:56.220
leading to further growth for the platform. This came alongside the rise of the term

04:06:56.220 --> 04:07:02.060
indie game. Once upon a time, there were no distinctions between games on the basis of developer

04:07:02.060 --> 04:07:07.980
status or budget, but as the industry grew, people eventually started to differentiate between

04:07:07.980 --> 04:07:13.900
small, cheaper, independent titles and the more traditional full-priced commercial releases.

04:07:15.180 --> 04:07:20.620
One of the first games to help create this distinction was Cave Story, which was developed

04:07:20.620 --> 04:07:28.300
by one man, Daisuke Amaya, over a five-year period starting when he was in college. Amaya was inspired

04:07:28.300 --> 04:07:34.300
by the games he played growing up, like Metroid, and so he made a 2D platforming adventure game

04:07:34.300 --> 04:07:41.340
with a retro visual style. Cave Story was finished in late 2004, with Amaya making it available

04:07:41.340 --> 04:07:46.460
online for free. The reason he didn't charge anything was because he thought the shareware

04:07:46.460 --> 04:07:51.900
model would be too much hassle to implement, and he just wanted more people to play his game

04:07:51.900 --> 04:07:58.860
after working on it for so long. And people did play his game, with several western media outlets

04:07:58.860 --> 04:08:03.580
reporting on and praising it soon after its release, and showing amazement that such a game

04:08:03.580 --> 04:08:10.780
could come from just one single developer. But as Cave Story released for free in a time before

04:08:10.780 --> 04:08:16.140
most people had ever heard the term indie game, it didn't find mainstream success, and Amaya

04:08:16.140 --> 04:08:21.260
simply continued working his full-time job at a printing company until six years later when

04:08:21.260 --> 04:08:26.060
Cave Story released on Nintendo's WiiWare service and finally became a commercial success.

04:08:27.420 --> 04:08:33.260
Cave Story has been described as the quintessential indie game and it would inspire others to follow

04:08:33.260 --> 04:08:39.020
in its wake, while digital distribution and new development tools made doing so more and more

04:08:39.020 --> 04:08:45.740
achievable. The next major step for indie games would once again come from Valve and a non-indie

04:08:45.740 --> 04:08:53.180
game however. Portal, released in 2007 and its creative puzzle design and memorable story made

04:08:53.180 --> 04:08:59.660
it one of the year's most critically acclaimed games. Portal was only about three hours long however,

04:08:59.660 --> 04:09:05.420
which seemed far too short for a normal full-priced commercial release. As a result,

04:09:05.420 --> 04:09:11.340
Valve got around this by selling it alongside Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 in a retail

04:09:11.340 --> 04:09:18.140
compilation called The Orange Box. Still, Portal's high quality and widespread popularity clearly

04:09:18.140 --> 04:09:23.820
highlighted the potential of smaller, more focused games. At the same time as this,

04:09:23.820 --> 04:09:28.300
Microsoft were looking to promote their own Xbox-focused digital distribution store,

04:09:28.300 --> 04:09:34.140
Xbox Live Arcade, which was a perfect place for indie games due to their smaller download sizes.

04:09:35.100 --> 04:09:41.340
And so, Microsoft began the Xbox Live Arcade Wednesdays program, which promised a new arcade

04:09:41.340 --> 04:09:47.260
game to be released each week over summer, as well as the Xbox Live Arcade unplugged compilation

04:09:47.260 --> 04:09:54.780
discs to promote Xbox Live Arcade games to normal retail consumers. This was followed by the Xbox

04:09:54.780 --> 04:10:00.700
Live Summer of Arcade, which began in 2008 and saw Microsoft heavily promote a series of newly

04:10:00.780 --> 04:10:06.540
releasing indie games each summer. The first year's lineup included Castle Crashers,

04:10:06.540 --> 04:10:13.740
Bionic Commando Rearmed, Gallagher Legions, Geometry Wars 2, and Braid. And this proved

04:10:13.740 --> 04:10:18.220
to be a big success, which helped establish the concept of indie games with general audiences.

04:10:19.340 --> 04:10:24.220
By 2009, promising indie titles were starting to become a common occurrence even outside of

04:10:24.220 --> 04:10:30.940
Xbox's Summer of Arcade and Steam. Spelunky, from Derrick U, combined platforming gameplay with

04:10:30.940 --> 04:10:36.140
the procedural generation of roguelikes to create a new type of non-traditional roguelike design

04:10:36.140 --> 04:10:42.460
that many future games would emulate. Flower, from Back Game Company, released on PSN and took

04:10:42.460 --> 04:10:47.180
players on a calm and emotional journey that contrasted sharply from the violence of most

04:10:47.180 --> 04:10:53.340
mainstream games. And World of Goo, from 2D Boy, released on PC and Wii and impressed with its

04:10:53.340 --> 04:11:00.620
simple yet challenging puzzle design and memorable presentation. And so, by 2010, indie games in the

04:11:00.620 --> 04:11:05.500
form that we think of them today had arrived and they were just starting to become an important

04:11:05.500 --> 04:11:17.020
force within an industry that was otherwise moving in the opposite direction. At the start of the

04:11:17.020 --> 04:11:21.980
decade, Sony were at the top of the industry and were preparing for the release of a console that

04:11:21.980 --> 04:11:28.380
would soon be even more successful. By the end of the decade, they were in last place and trying

04:11:28.380 --> 04:11:33.340
desperately to rebuild their damage reputation. At the start of the decade, Microsoft was still

04:11:33.340 --> 04:11:37.740
yet to formally enter the gaming space, yet by the decade's end, they were in the strongest

04:11:37.740 --> 04:11:42.380
position they would ever find themselves in, with the Xbox looking increasingly like the

04:11:42.380 --> 04:11:49.180
core gaming console of choice. At the start of the decade, Nintendo were THE company for classic

04:11:49.180 --> 04:11:55.500
console gaming, yet by its end, they were finding new levels of success by appealing to new audiences

04:11:55.500 --> 04:12:02.140
with new types of technology. Things change fast in the gaming industry, and in just a few more

04:12:02.140 --> 04:12:09.020
years, everything just mentioned would end up changing again. But it wasn't just the fates

04:12:09.020 --> 04:12:15.340
of the major players that were in flux in the 2000s. Game design itself would see major evolution

04:12:15.340 --> 04:12:19.180
as mainstream gaming moved further and further towards a triple-A approach.

04:12:20.140 --> 04:12:25.100
The jump from the 6th to 7th console generation would be the last time that new consoles would

04:12:25.100 --> 04:12:31.340
bring a really noticeable upgrade in graphics, as games went from 480 to 720 resolution,

04:12:31.900 --> 04:12:37.660
but even this came at a cost, as the average frame rate of console games dropped as a result

04:12:37.660 --> 04:12:44.460
from 60 FPS down to 30. For years, gaming graphics had steadily increased,

04:12:44.460 --> 04:12:49.260
but now, the industry was starting to see diminishing returns, with sacrifices having to

04:12:49.260 --> 04:12:55.660
be made to performance to make continued advancement possible. And yet, the best-selling

04:12:55.660 --> 04:13:00.460
and most critically acclaimed games were, without doubt, the ones that looked the best.

04:13:01.500 --> 04:13:08.220
In 2009, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 broke records for sales, and Uncharted 2 broke records

04:13:08.220 --> 04:13:14.300
for Game of the Year awards, with both games putting a huge focus on linear cinematic set pieces

04:13:14.300 --> 04:13:17.820
and the highest levels of presentation that technology would allow.

04:13:18.780 --> 04:13:24.220
And yet, while mainstream gaming was getting noticeably more expensive and less diverse,

04:13:24.220 --> 04:13:29.740
it was other areas of gaming that would see the largest growth. At the end of 2009,

04:13:29.740 --> 04:13:35.740
rovio entertainment's Angry Birds and Pop Caps, Plants vs Zombies had just released,

04:13:35.740 --> 04:13:40.460
as smartphone-fuelled mobile gaming was becoming a larger and larger section of the industry.

04:13:41.260 --> 04:13:46.220
Sony and Microsoft were both preparing for the release of their own motion-controlled devices

04:13:46.220 --> 04:13:51.500
to try to replicate Nintendo's success with casual audiences, and a little indie game by

04:13:51.500 --> 04:13:56.940
the name of Minecraft was starting to make waves online after its first release to the public,

04:13:56.940 --> 04:14:01.980
while a little multiplayer game called League of Legends was just coming to the end of its beta.

04:14:03.180 --> 04:14:09.660
Gaming was changing, just like it always does, and the changes of the next decade

04:14:09.660 --> 04:14:16.300
would see some of the industry's toughest challenges yet, alongside some of its best and worst moments.

04:14:23.260 --> 04:14:28.940
The console wars would continue in the 2010s, but the first battle was fought over motion controls.

04:14:29.900 --> 04:14:33.980
Nintendo had responded to criticism of the original Wii Remote's poor precision

04:14:33.980 --> 04:14:40.940
with the Wii Motion Plus in 2009. This new add-on upped the accuracy, but only in games developed

04:14:40.940 --> 04:14:45.900
with it in mind, and it would be required for certain later titles like Wii Sports Resort

04:14:45.900 --> 04:14:51.900
and The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword. Still, both Sony and Microsoft focused their marketing

04:14:51.900 --> 04:14:55.180
on why their new devices were better than the Wii.

04:15:03.980 --> 04:15:08.460
Sony boasted about their accuracy, pointing to the little glowing plastic ball on the end of

04:15:08.460 --> 04:15:13.820
the PlayStation Move Remote as proof that the device is special, and making liberal use of

04:15:13.820 --> 04:15:20.300
terms like accelerometer, inertial sensors, synergistic processing units, and internal

04:15:20.300 --> 04:15:24.860
magnetometers. And no, I did not make any of both terms up just now.

04:15:26.060 --> 04:15:30.780
Microsoft, on the other hand, decided the best marketing strategy was to freak everyone out

04:15:30.780 --> 04:15:35.100
with their surreal virtual child simulator, Project Milo, in 2009.

04:16:01.740 --> 04:16:12.460
Unfortunately, while it may have apparently worked that day, one year later, when Microsoft

04:16:12.460 --> 04:16:16.780
returned to showcase the Kinect again, it was rather less impressive, being something more

04:16:16.780 --> 04:16:21.980
in line with the earlier PlayStation Eye toy. Meanwhile, the child Milo was never seen again.

04:16:23.260 --> 04:16:28.300
For gaming fans that were happy using normal controllers, this was a strange time to be alive.

04:16:29.260 --> 04:16:35.100
Both E3 and gaming media were dominated by the new upcoming battle for motion control supremacy.

04:16:35.980 --> 04:16:41.660
For a time, the question of who would win between Kinect, the Move, and the Wii was treated with

04:16:41.660 --> 04:16:46.860
the utmost importance, as if we were only now about to see the real battle that would determine

04:16:46.860 --> 04:16:52.380
gaming's future. In the end, though, it turned out gaming's future had other plans.

04:16:53.340 --> 04:16:58.780
The PlayStation Move, released in September 2010, received positive reviews for accuracy

04:16:58.780 --> 04:17:03.980
and responsiveness, particularly when compared to the Wii, and then produced disappointing sales,

04:17:03.980 --> 04:17:08.380
as the more serious gaming audience Sony were targeting at the time showed little interest.

04:17:09.260 --> 04:17:13.500
A disappointing selection of games to support it certainly didn't help either,

04:17:13.500 --> 04:17:15.980
and in three years' time, it was all but forgotten.

04:17:16.140 --> 04:17:23.020
Microsoft's Kinect, on the other hand, released in November 2010 for a higher price and received

04:17:23.020 --> 04:17:27.420
worse reviews, and then it broke the world records for the fastest-selling consumer

04:17:27.420 --> 04:17:33.020
electronic device, while easily surpassing the Move in the process, probably because it was

04:17:33.020 --> 04:17:37.740
marketed heavily towards a more casual audience and the controller-free experience it offered

04:17:37.740 --> 04:17:44.300
was something different to the already widespread Wii. Reviewers criticised input lag and the lack

04:17:44.300 --> 04:17:49.980
of depth in games on offer, but did praise the Kinect's innovativeness. Three years later,

04:17:49.980 --> 04:17:56.140
and the Kinect was far from forgotten, but we'll get to that later. Around this time,

04:17:56.140 --> 04:18:00.620
the Wii would also see its sales slow, as the motion control craze seemed to be coming to

04:18:00.620 --> 04:18:06.700
its natural conclusion after the novelty started to wear off. Still, while motion control might

04:18:06.700 --> 04:18:10.860
have dominated the news at that time, something else was dominating sales.

04:18:11.340 --> 04:18:16.700
In 2009, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 broke sales records for biggest entertainment launch

04:18:16.700 --> 04:18:24.300
in history, across all media. In 2010, Call of Duty Black Ops broke the same records,

04:18:24.300 --> 04:18:31.020
surpassing Modern Warfare 2. In 2011, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 broke records again,

04:18:31.020 --> 04:18:36.860
surpassing Black Ops, and in 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 broke records again,

04:18:37.020 --> 04:18:43.740
surpassing Modern Warfare 3. Call of Duty's reign of terror would not last forever,

04:18:43.740 --> 04:18:50.300
but at the start of the 2010s, it certainly seemed like it might. Put simply, Call of Duty was the

04:18:50.300 --> 04:18:55.740
biggest thing in gaming at the time, with release after release, easily managing to sell over 20

04:18:55.740 --> 04:19:02.620
million copies, and there was a new release every single year. The multiplayer formula established

04:19:02.620 --> 04:19:08.300
by Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare proved incredibly popular with players, and Activision was happy

04:19:08.300 --> 04:19:14.380
to do everything they could to cash in on this. And so, in a time when there was less online

04:19:14.380 --> 04:19:21.900
shooter competition, Call of Duty became the undisputed king. Amidst the soaring popularity of

04:19:21.900 --> 04:19:27.900
mobile games, the yearly domination of Call of Duty, and the newly arriving motion control devices,

04:19:27.900 --> 04:19:33.900
there was a sense at this time that older, or core gaming audiences, might be being left behind

04:19:33.900 --> 04:19:38.940
in an industry that didn't seem to need them anymore. This would play a major role in the

04:19:38.940 --> 04:19:43.980
next console generation, but there were still well-received games being released in this period,

04:19:43.980 --> 04:19:48.540
and amongst them, a new trend was on the rise. The Open World

04:19:49.660 --> 04:19:54.380
After the record success of Grand Theft Auto on the PlayStation 2, it's no surprise that more

04:19:54.380 --> 04:19:59.580
games would try to copy its approach to Open World design, but while the 2000s would see a large

04:19:59.580 --> 04:20:05.740
number of Grand Theft Auto clones, few of them ended up leaving a lasting impact. Things would

04:20:05.740 --> 04:20:10.300
change at the start of the next decade, however, as developers started to look beyond Grand Theft

04:20:10.300 --> 04:20:18.940
Auto for Open World inspiration. Games like Fallout 3 in 2008, Assassin's Creed II in 2009, Red Dead

04:20:18.940 --> 04:20:26.060
Redemption and Fallout New Vegas in 2010, Batman, Arkham City and the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim in 2011,

04:20:26.060 --> 04:20:32.460
and Far Cry 3 in 2012 all achieved critical and commercial success to help popularise the

04:20:32.460 --> 04:20:37.580
Open World as a concept that would soon come to be used more broadly in mainstream game design.

04:20:38.780 --> 04:20:43.980
And as the decade continued, more and more games made the transition to Open World,

04:20:44.060 --> 04:20:50.460
including most of the biggest series in gaming, like Metal Gear Solid, The Witcher, Dragon Age,

04:20:50.460 --> 04:20:58.540
Final Fantasy, Mass Effect, Forza, The Legend of Zelda, Halo and Pokemon, alongside many of the

04:20:58.540 --> 04:21:06.060
decade's biggest new IPs. This fit the established gaming industry trends of trying to make bigger

04:21:06.060 --> 04:21:11.180
and better games to continually one up what came before, where Open World seemed to represent

04:21:11.180 --> 04:21:15.980
the next step in this while also providing an opportunity to breathe new life into established

04:21:15.980 --> 04:21:21.980
franchises. The move towards Open World brought benefits like increased immersion and player

04:21:21.980 --> 04:21:27.340
freedom, but it would also lead to criticism about repetition and game experiences being drawn out

04:21:27.340 --> 04:21:32.620
or padded, with the term Open World Fatigue sometimes being used as the decade continued.

04:21:33.820 --> 04:21:39.020
Still, at the start of the decade, Open Worlds were relatively fresh, and early examples like

04:21:39.020 --> 04:21:43.500
Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim were some of the most highly praised and best-selling games

04:21:43.500 --> 04:21:49.420
of their respective years. Still, while much of gaming at this time was moving in certain

04:21:49.420 --> 04:21:54.380
recognizable directions, there were two games which stood out for doing something different.

04:21:55.660 --> 04:22:02.540
The first was Dark Souls, which released in 2011 on consoles and 2012 on PC.

04:22:02.780 --> 04:22:08.220
From Software had already impressed players with Demon's Souls in 2009, but Dark Souls was where

04:22:08.220 --> 04:22:12.940
they would reach a much wider audience, and the game quickly developed a reputation for its high

04:22:12.940 --> 04:22:19.340
difficulty and unforgiving design. What really made Dark Souls stand out however was how different

04:22:19.340 --> 04:22:25.340
it felt from so many other games of its era. Since the days of arcades, video games had been

04:22:25.340 --> 04:22:30.620
becoming easier and more accessible year after year, to the point where increasing accessibility

04:22:30.860 --> 04:22:38.060
was seen as a fundamental part of good game design. The general consensus was that older

04:22:38.060 --> 04:22:44.380
games were often far too punishing, so developers added things like regenerating health and regular

04:22:44.380 --> 04:22:51.580
checkpoints. Or that old games were too vague and confusing, so developers added more tutorials,

04:22:51.580 --> 04:22:58.380
guidance, and features like mini-maps. Or that old games were too simple and video-gamey,

04:22:58.380 --> 04:23:03.740
so developers focused more on the cinematic side with action set pieces and cutscenes.

04:23:04.940 --> 04:23:12.540
And then, Dark Souls came along and ignored all of this. It punished players for mistakes,

04:23:12.540 --> 04:23:18.220
even taking away their valuable experience points. It gave players minimal direction and made a world

04:23:18.220 --> 04:23:24.380
where it was easy to get lost, and it told its story almost entirely indirectly, leaving 99%

04:23:24.460 --> 04:23:30.620
of the experience as pure gameplay. Dark Souls broke all the rules about how a modern game

04:23:30.620 --> 04:23:36.940
should be designed, and in doing so, it created something unique which many players fell in love

04:23:36.940 --> 04:23:43.020
with. With time, Dark Souls developed one of the most enduring legacies of any game from the

04:23:43.020 --> 04:23:49.660
modern era, although its reception at release was more modest. It was only the 32nd highest

04:23:49.660 --> 04:23:56.940
reviewed game from 2011, and it was widely ignored by Game of the Year awards. Yet, it was also a

04:23:56.940 --> 04:24:03.020
game which people kept playing and talking about, and soon its influence was hard to deny. Every

04:24:03.020 --> 04:24:08.540
difficult game would come to be compared to it. Countless indie games would directly copy it,

04:24:08.540 --> 04:24:14.380
and even mainstream games would start to indirectly copy it, all while its reputation kept growing.

04:24:14.620 --> 04:24:20.860
In short, from combat design, to the lack of handholding, to the use of difficulty, or its

04:24:20.860 --> 04:24:26.220
approach to storytelling, Dark Souls was a title which made the industry re-evaluate what good

04:24:26.220 --> 04:24:33.420
game design truly meant, and yet, it arguably wasn't even the most important game released that year.

04:24:34.860 --> 04:24:37.660
If Dark Souls challenged how people fought about game design,

04:24:38.220 --> 04:24:43.420
Minecraft challenged how people fought about video games. Beginning at the hands of a single

04:24:43.420 --> 04:24:48.940
developer, Marcus Notch Pearson, Minecraft would go on to become the best-selling game of all time,

04:24:48.940 --> 04:24:55.020
with a staggering 238 million copies sold, a number which is still rising.

04:24:56.380 --> 04:25:02.220
Notch took inspiration from the ambitious ColonySim, Dwarf Fortress, and the block-based mining game

04:25:02.220 --> 04:25:07.980
Infiniminer to create a procedurally generated block-building sandbox that was made available

04:25:07.980 --> 04:25:13.420
to the public online in 2009, and received regular updates over the next two years.

04:25:14.780 --> 04:25:21.500
In 2011, it received its official release, and in 2014, Minecraft was bought by Microsoft for

04:25:21.500 --> 04:25:28.620
$2.5 billion, with the game still receiving regular updates to this day. Beyond simply being one of

04:25:28.620 --> 04:25:34.380
the most played games ever made, Minecraft popularized the concept of early access, where players

04:25:34.380 --> 04:25:39.260
paid to access a game that's still in development, and continuous development, where a game is

04:25:39.260 --> 04:25:45.340
continually expanded over time with no specific planned ending. It also challenged the perceived

04:25:45.340 --> 04:25:50.860
importance of graphics in gaming. For years, graphics had been getting better and better,

04:25:50.860 --> 04:25:56.380
and becoming a larger and larger priority, even as this caused development time and costs to

04:25:56.380 --> 04:26:02.780
continually increase. Then, Minecraft came along with pixelated blocky visuals that looked

04:26:02.780 --> 04:26:07.180
several generations old, and became the most successful game in history.

04:26:08.460 --> 04:26:14.300
In doing so, Minecraft proved that not only are high quality graphics not needed for a game to be

04:26:14.300 --> 04:26:21.500
successful, but also that graphics might sometimes be holding gaming back. Minecraft's popularity

04:26:21.500 --> 04:26:26.780
was a result of the freedom it provided players to create and explore and do more than most other

04:26:26.780 --> 04:26:32.140
games allowed, and this level of freedom was only made possible by the simpler visual style,

04:26:32.140 --> 04:26:37.420
where not every asset needed thousands and thousands of polygons or multiple dedicated artists.

04:26:38.620 --> 04:26:43.660
At a time when the gaming industry was fully embracing AAA design and indie games were still

04:26:43.660 --> 04:26:50.620
finding their footing, Minecraft was a monumental statement about what video games could and maybe

04:26:50.620 --> 04:26:58.460
should be. And between Minecraft, Dark Souls, the open world trend, yearly call of duties,

04:26:58.460 --> 04:27:03.820
and unwanted motion controls, you have a great representation of what the next decade in gaming

04:27:03.820 --> 04:27:10.700
would be all about. Video games were changing just like they always were, but now conflicts and

04:27:10.700 --> 04:27:15.660
divisions were starting to be more obvious as the industry continued to grow and expand.

04:27:16.700 --> 04:27:21.900
Within this, multiple distinct battles can be identified, like mainstream versus indie,

04:27:22.460 --> 04:27:29.820
conventional game design versus counterculture, core gaming versus casual, maximizing monetization

04:27:29.820 --> 04:27:36.140
versus preserving a franchise, and so on. And it was these divisions that would truly define

04:27:36.140 --> 04:27:40.540
the next decade, including the next generation of console warfare.

04:27:40.780 --> 04:27:50.220
In the 7th generation, Sony shocked the world by losing.

04:27:51.260 --> 04:27:57.980
After years of PlayStation domination, Sony looked unstoppable, but a high price,

04:27:57.980 --> 04:28:02.860
complicated system architecture, and the loss of key exclusives allowed Microsoft to close the

04:28:02.860 --> 04:28:07.900
gap with core gamers while Nintendo thrived for appealing to new and more casual audiences.

04:28:08.860 --> 04:28:12.140
The fate of all three of these companies would soon change though,

04:28:12.140 --> 04:28:15.340
and this started before the next generation even arrived.

04:28:16.540 --> 04:28:22.620
After years of leading the pack, the Wii sales fell behind both the 360 and PS3 at the same time

04:28:22.620 --> 04:28:26.860
that new motion control competition arrived and consumer interest seemed to wane.

04:28:27.980 --> 04:28:33.900
Microsoft saw its lead over Sony dwindle and eventually disappear as the 360 lost momentum

04:28:33.980 --> 04:28:39.980
amidst few new exclusives, and Sony's system saw its finest years after price cuts and model

04:28:39.980 --> 04:28:45.980
revisions turned around sales. Sony's strong end to the generation would be complete with the release

04:28:45.980 --> 04:28:52.620
of The Last of Us in summer 2013, which was heralded as one of the finest games of the generation,

04:28:52.620 --> 04:28:58.140
at the same time that the PS3 finally managed to overtake the 360's total lifetime sales.

04:28:58.140 --> 04:29:04.540
Focus then turned to the next generation, which had officially begun in 2012.

04:29:29.100 --> 04:29:37.260
This was the world first reveal of Nintendo's new console as shown at E3 2011.

04:29:38.460 --> 04:29:41.900
You may notice a heavy emphasis on the word controller.

04:29:42.860 --> 04:29:48.700
This trailer is 3 minutes long and that word shows up on screen 12 different times.

04:29:49.900 --> 04:29:55.340
The word console isn't used once and the Wii U console isn't even shown.

04:29:55.340 --> 04:30:01.980
The Wii U was one of Nintendo's greatest failures and much of that failure is often said to be down

04:30:01.980 --> 04:30:08.460
to consumers failing to understand what the system even was. Looking at the reveal trailer shows how

04:30:08.460 --> 04:30:15.260
this might have happened and even among gaming media this caused some confusion. Amongst general

04:30:15.260 --> 04:30:21.020
consumers who may not follow gaming news closely, i.e. much of the Wii's new player base, it would

04:30:21.020 --> 04:30:27.180
have been easy to mistake this device as just an expensive add-on or a new Nintendo themed tablet

04:30:27.180 --> 04:30:34.220
and this poor marketing decision surely hurt the system's sales. This isn't the whole story however

04:30:34.220 --> 04:30:39.500
and even during its development the Wii U experienced a bit of an identity crisis that went on to

04:30:39.500 --> 04:30:46.860
follow it for the rest of its life. The Wii exceeded Nintendo's expectations and excelled with casual

04:30:46.860 --> 04:30:52.300
gamers but Nintendo started to worry that if they appealed too much to casual audiences it might hurt

04:30:52.300 --> 04:30:58.620
their reputation with more core audiences. As a result, Nintendo made bridging the gap between

04:30:58.620 --> 04:31:05.180
the two groups a priority for their next system and so they decided on HD graphics as this was

04:31:05.180 --> 04:31:10.700
expected from core audiences and that it should also include a new innovative feature that could

04:31:10.700 --> 04:31:17.740
appeal to families and Wii fans hence the tablet like controller. This controller wasn't as

04:31:17.740 --> 04:31:22.540
revolutionary as the Wii's motion controller bin though as tablet computers were already gaining

04:31:22.540 --> 04:31:29.820
popularity at this time. The controller was also heavy and bulky in design, had a short battery life

04:31:29.820 --> 04:31:35.340
and needed to be in range of the Wii U console to be used making it more limited than an actual tablet.

04:31:36.540 --> 04:31:39.980
Nintendo also struggled to show off the advantages this hybrid approach brought to

04:31:39.980 --> 04:31:45.740
game design whereas the Wii's motion control was simple to understand and easily demonstrated.

04:31:47.180 --> 04:31:55.580
Still, in November 2012 the Wii U launched to the public for $299 or $349. The critical

04:31:55.580 --> 04:32:00.780
reception was mostly positive with praise given to its backwards compatibility with Wii games and

04:32:00.780 --> 04:32:07.020
peripherals as well as the potential of its unique controller. Initial sales were lower than Nintendo

04:32:07.020 --> 04:32:12.540
expected though and the launch lineup had few must-play titles with the best sellers being a new

04:32:12.540 --> 04:32:19.580
new Super Mario Bros and the party game Nintendo Land. As time went on Nintendo would release more

04:32:19.580 --> 04:32:25.100
games on the system including new entries into most of the series people expected like Mario Kart

04:32:25.100 --> 04:32:29.580
and Smash Bros although the importance of these games may have been diminished by the fact that

04:32:29.580 --> 04:32:36.220
many also released on Nintendo's latest handheld the 3DS. The Wii U's biggest problem however would

04:32:36.220 --> 04:32:42.780
once again be third party support. At the start of the Wii U's life it was on par with the still

04:32:42.780 --> 04:32:49.500
current PS3 and Xbox 360 meaning titles could be ported between these systems and these ports made

04:32:49.500 --> 04:32:55.180
up a big part of the Wii U's early lineup. These games rarely made interesting use of the Wii U's

04:32:55.180 --> 04:33:00.060
unique controller and sometimes ran worse than the older generation versions due to differences

04:33:00.060 --> 04:33:04.860
with the system's hardware but this was still a lot better than what was to follow.

04:33:06.300 --> 04:33:11.020
Once the next generation of consoles arrived the Wii U once again became technically inferior

04:33:11.020 --> 04:33:15.900
to its rivals causing great difficulty for third parties when porting multi-platform games to the

04:33:15.900 --> 04:33:22.220
system and as the Wii U got off to a slow start which led to a small user base third parties

04:33:22.220 --> 04:33:28.060
then had even less incentive to bring their games to the system at all. Less than one year after its

04:33:28.060 --> 04:33:34.460
release EA and Bethesda both publicly stated that they had little plans for future Wii U games and

04:33:34.460 --> 04:33:40.620
this problem only grew over time. By the end of the Wii U's life the only game amongst its best

04:33:40.620 --> 04:33:47.340
selling titles that didn't come directly from Nintendo was Minecraft and so for the fourth

04:33:47.340 --> 04:33:53.420
generation in a row Nintendo's console was the worst place to be for third party games and this

04:33:53.420 --> 04:33:59.500
time the problem was bigger than ever. Nintendo designed the Wii U as a system that would appeal

04:33:59.500 --> 04:34:05.260
to both casual and core audiences but with little third party support and few games which made

04:34:05.260 --> 04:34:11.020
interesting use of the controller the Wii U failed to pull in many core gamers and with confusing

04:34:11.020 --> 04:34:16.460
marketing a high price and the lack of a strong new gimmick it failed to replicate the Wii success

04:34:16.460 --> 04:34:24.140
with casual gamers and so the Wii U was a complete failure and dumped Nintendo firmly into last place

04:34:24.140 --> 04:34:31.100
as soon as its competitors arrived. But as disappointing for Nintendo as this must have been

04:34:31.100 --> 04:34:36.220
at least they could soon console themselves but they weren't the only one who dropped the ball

04:34:36.220 --> 04:34:40.780
in the eighth generation. Introducing Xbox One.

04:35:06.780 --> 04:35:31.580
To understand how the eighth generation was won you have to keep in mind what had been happening

04:35:31.580 --> 04:35:36.860
leading up to it. The biggest trends over the last five or six years had been the success of

04:35:36.860 --> 04:35:42.540
the Wii and motion control, the huge growth in the mobile market and call of duty continuing

04:35:42.540 --> 04:35:49.180
to break every sales record under the sun. People may not have admitted it but the truth was core

04:35:49.180 --> 04:35:55.020
gamers were starting to feel like they were being forgotten. The industry was growing but it was

04:35:55.020 --> 04:35:59.340
growing away from what made many people like games in the first place and the only thing big

04:35:59.340 --> 04:36:04.380
company seemed to care about now was finding new ways to reach the more lucrative casual market.

04:36:05.660 --> 04:36:11.260
And so as the next generation was about to be revealed there was never a more important moment

04:36:11.260 --> 04:36:19.340
to put the focus squarely back on high quality games. Then came the official Xbox One reveal show

04:36:19.900 --> 04:36:25.100
which was the first look at Microsoft's new system and a moment Xbox fans had been waiting for

04:36:25.100 --> 04:36:35.820
for years and the only thing being mentioned was TV. It took 33 minutes almost all of which was

04:36:35.820 --> 04:36:42.380
focused on TV before a single video game was shown and when it was it was just a highlight reel for

04:36:42.380 --> 04:36:48.620
the next yearly installment of multi-platform EA sports titles. This was followed by the more

04:36:48.620 --> 04:36:56.380
promising Forza 5 then a newly announced confusing game TV show hybrid called Quantum Break and then

04:36:56.380 --> 04:37:02.780
it was back to actual TV coverage. Halo made an appearance as a newly announced TV show,

04:37:03.340 --> 04:37:09.260
Steven Spielberg made an appearance to talk about TV, American football made an appearance as something

04:37:09.260 --> 04:37:14.620
you can apparently watch on TV and then the show finished with Microsoft's biggest reveal.

04:37:15.580 --> 04:37:24.300
Call of Duty will appear on Xbox later that year just as it had for the last six years because

04:37:24.300 --> 04:37:31.660
it was a multi-platform yearly series and then the show was over. This was how Microsoft threw away

04:37:31.660 --> 04:37:38.380
all the goodwill they had slowly built with core audiences over the last 10 years. At a time when

04:37:38.380 --> 04:37:43.180
gamers were worried about how the industry was changing Microsoft used the one moment where

04:37:43.180 --> 04:37:49.660
everyone was watching them to prove that all of people's fears were true. The reception to this

04:37:49.660 --> 04:37:57.260
reveal was universally negative but things would soon get a whole lot worse. Three weeks later at

04:37:57.260 --> 04:38:03.180
E3 2013 Microsoft had one last chance to make a big impression before their system's release

04:38:04.220 --> 04:38:10.300
and the show ended up dominated by news that the Xbox One would be an always online system

04:38:10.300 --> 04:38:14.940
that owners couldn't play games on it without an internet connection but people could no longer

04:38:14.940 --> 04:38:21.260
sell or share used games due to new DRM measures and that the built-in Kinect would be always on,

04:38:21.260 --> 04:38:26.700
watching you, recording your daily activities for storage in Microsoft database in case of any

04:38:26.700 --> 04:38:32.860
future bad behaviour. That last part may have been added more by the public than Microsoft

04:38:32.860 --> 04:38:38.220
themselves and Microsoft were a little unfortunate to be holding their press conference one week

04:38:38.220 --> 04:38:43.260
after Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing unlawful surveillance by global security agencies.

04:38:44.220 --> 04:38:47.820
Still for the most part Microsoft did it to themselves.

04:39:03.260 --> 04:39:07.180
At this point victory was being handed to Sony on a silver platter

04:39:07.180 --> 04:39:11.020
and all they had to do was mention video games a few times

04:39:11.020 --> 04:39:14.300
and remind people that at least they're not Microsoft.

04:39:15.260 --> 04:39:21.500
In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4 were equally focused on

04:39:21.500 --> 04:39:27.820
delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.

04:39:28.700 --> 04:39:34.460
For instance PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PS4 gamers.

04:39:41.340 --> 04:39:42.380
Guess that's a good thing.

04:39:44.780 --> 04:39:50.380
We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.

04:39:50.940 --> 04:39:56.940
Just heard you there. When a gamer buys a PS4 disc they have the rights to use that copy of the game.

04:39:56.940 --> 04:40:03.500
They can trade in the game at retail sell it to another person lend it to a friend or keep it forever.

04:40:15.660 --> 04:40:21.500
In addition PlayStation 4 disc based games don't need to be connected online to play.

04:40:27.340 --> 04:40:39.500
And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.

04:40:41.980 --> 04:40:44.620
Sony's best announcement was still to come however.

04:40:45.260 --> 04:40:51.500
I'm very proud to announce that PlayStation 4 will be available at $399.

04:40:57.660 --> 04:41:04.540
This meant the PlayStation 4 would be $100 cheaper than the Xbox One and it wasn't

04:41:04.540 --> 04:41:10.300
because of less powerful hardware. In fact if anything the PlayStation 4 seemed to be the most

04:41:10.300 --> 04:41:15.980
powerful system. The reason for the Xbox's higher price was the built-in connect device

04:41:15.980 --> 04:41:20.540
a feature but offered several benefits yet was highly disliked by many in gaming communities.

04:41:21.660 --> 04:41:25.580
For Microsoft the reveal and its follow-up were a disaster.

04:41:26.540 --> 04:41:31.180
One week after E3 they announced that the new DRM policy would be scrapped,

04:41:31.180 --> 04:41:35.740
that the system would no longer require an internet connection and that owners would even be allowed

04:41:35.740 --> 04:41:41.820
to unplug the connect and still use the console. President of Microsoft's interactive entertainment

04:41:41.820 --> 04:41:47.420
business Von Matrick departed shortly after but by this point the damage was already done

04:41:47.420 --> 04:41:53.980
and the high price still remained. In November 2013 both consoles released to the public with

04:41:54.060 --> 04:41:59.980
the PlayStation 4 quickly selling out. By the end of the year it had sold 1.2 million more units

04:41:59.980 --> 04:42:05.820
than the Xbox One and with time this lead grew until in 2015 Microsoft announced that they would

04:42:05.820 --> 04:42:11.340
no longer be publishing sales figures. Microsoft may have hoped that after the release of the

04:42:11.340 --> 04:42:17.180
Xbox One their reputation might improve due to the quality of the system but unfortunately for them

04:42:17.180 --> 04:42:22.700
this too was not to be because while the two consoles were similar in specs and architecture

04:42:22.700 --> 04:42:27.260
it was the PlayStation 4 which seemed to have the edge and was consistently performing better

04:42:27.260 --> 04:42:32.700
when it came to multi-platform games. For Microsoft there was little they could do but

04:42:32.700 --> 04:42:42.220
dig in repair their damaged reputation and prepare for the future. At E3 2014 they revealed a $399

04:42:42.220 --> 04:42:47.900
connect free version of the console to bring the system in line with the PlayStation. The TV focused

04:42:47.900 --> 04:42:53.260
Xbox entertainment studios was also closed later that year and focus for the future shifted

04:42:53.260 --> 04:42:59.020
more towards video games with Microsoft purchasing several studios including Mojang the creators

04:42:59.020 --> 04:43:03.900
of Minecraft which Microsoft continued to allow on Sony systems in what they hoped would be seen

04:43:03.900 --> 04:43:11.100
as a pro consumer move. For Sony their lead over both Microsoft and Nintendo never seemed to be

04:43:11.100 --> 04:43:17.180
any doubt and while in time Microsoft did succeed at distancing themselves from past controversies

04:43:17.180 --> 04:43:21.980
the PlayStation 4 continued to be a well-received and well-liked system that offered a far more

04:43:21.980 --> 04:43:29.660
impressive list of exclusive titles. This lineup was admittedly slow to get going but later included

04:43:29.660 --> 04:43:37.020
Marvel's Spider-Man, God of War, Uncharted 4, The Last of Us Part 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghosts of

04:43:37.020 --> 04:43:44.380
Tsushima, Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Bloodborne. Meanwhile the Xbox One had few highly reviewed

04:43:44.380 --> 04:43:51.500
exclusives outside of Halo, Years of War and Forza. Still by this point exclusive titles played a much

04:43:51.500 --> 04:43:56.060
smaller role in determining a console's fate than they had in the past with most games being

04:43:56.060 --> 04:44:01.740
multi-platform and with console exclusives increasingly being released on PC by all parties

04:44:01.740 --> 04:44:08.540
except Nintendo. There can be no mistake however that the PlayStation 4 won the eighth generation.

04:44:09.260 --> 04:44:15.980
The most recent sales figures show that Sony's system sold over 117 million units which is more

04:44:15.980 --> 04:44:23.660
than twice as many as the Xbox One and vastly more than the 13.5 million of the Wii U. For Nintendo

04:44:23.660 --> 04:44:29.740
the battle was lost before it even began. For Microsoft, inferior multi-platform performance,

04:44:29.740 --> 04:44:34.220
few exclusives and a higher launch price are what ultimately doomed the Xbox One

04:44:34.220 --> 04:44:39.340
although the damage done by the poor handling of the initial reveal and the heavy focus on TV

04:44:39.340 --> 04:44:42.700
made sure that the system got off to the worst possible start.

04:44:44.380 --> 04:44:49.740
Microsoft had found some success at targeting casual audiences with the release of the Kinect in

04:44:49.740 --> 04:44:55.420
2010 and they presumably hoped to continue this by including the Kinect with their new console and

04:44:55.420 --> 04:45:01.660
focusing heavily on multimedia. We wanted to bring new audiences into Xbox. People that were outside

04:45:01.660 --> 04:45:05.980
of what traditionally was thought of as our core gaming audience that was really the intent at the time.

04:45:06.620 --> 04:45:11.820
Within the company there's always a sense of do more and grow but I think Don was looking for like

04:45:11.820 --> 04:45:18.140
what's that next big leap after Kinect and I think there was a sense that TV could be that thing.

04:45:18.140 --> 04:45:22.460
Like Nintendo finding that the Wii U had to compete with real tablets though,

04:45:22.460 --> 04:45:28.060
smart TVs were also readily available by the time the Xbox One launched which made much of the

04:45:28.060 --> 04:45:34.060
system's multimedia utility less impressive. Their biggest mistake however was simply failing

04:45:34.060 --> 04:45:40.460
to consider their core audience when designing their system and marketing it. If they'd focused on

04:45:40.460 --> 04:45:45.980
TV in addition to video games the reaction wouldn't have been so negative but instead

04:45:45.980 --> 04:45:51.980
all they had to show alongside their TV related announcements were anti-consumer features like

04:45:51.980 --> 04:45:58.380
Always Online and DRM and a high price that was a result of a feature most people didn't even want.

04:45:59.820 --> 04:46:05.340
When gamers were worried about being abandoned by the industry Microsoft did exactly that

04:46:05.980 --> 04:46:14.860
and it cost them. Still like others before them Microsoft and Nintendo were down but not out

04:46:14.860 --> 04:46:20.300
and things do change quickly in gaming as the rest of the industry was making clear.

04:46:22.940 --> 04:46:31.900
When the DS and PSP went head to head in the mid-2000s Nintendo was the clear winner but the

04:46:31.900 --> 04:46:36.860
PlayStation portable was far from a failure and as the next generation of handhelds was revealed

04:46:36.860 --> 04:46:42.460
at the start of the 2010s it looked like history might repeat with both companies sticking to a

04:46:42.460 --> 04:46:48.860
similar approach. Sony doubled down on power boasting of near PlayStation 3 level graphics

04:46:48.940 --> 04:46:54.540
and Nintendo introduced a new unique feature to complement their dual screen design by way of

04:46:54.540 --> 04:47:01.740
stereoscopic 3D. This is something Nintendo had been flirting with for years. First with the Japan

04:47:01.740 --> 04:47:08.620
only Famicom 3D system in the 80s then with the universally panned virtual boy in the 90s and even

04:47:08.620 --> 04:47:15.900
with an unreleased LCD attachment for the GameCube in the early 2000s. This time however 3D was the

04:47:15.900 --> 04:47:21.340
main attraction and with a relatively low cost and no need for additional glasses it was a feature

04:47:21.340 --> 04:47:31.420
that got people talking. The Nintendo 3DS released in March 2011 for $250. Reviews were positive

04:47:31.420 --> 04:47:36.380
with praise given to the addition of a new circle pad analog controller, backwards compatibility

04:47:36.380 --> 04:47:42.140
with DS games and the improved user interface while criticism was directed towards low battery life.

04:47:43.100 --> 04:47:48.860
The main talking point though was unsurprisingly the 3D effect with reactions varying widely

04:47:48.860 --> 04:47:54.860
and these reactions were more important than usual as the 3D effect didn't pick up on camera making

04:47:54.860 --> 04:48:01.020
it hard for Nintendo to show off. Still some people were blown away by the effect, some saw it as

04:48:01.020 --> 04:48:07.820
nothing but a gimmick and some complained about it inducing nausea and headaches. It also required

04:48:07.900 --> 04:48:13.500
rather precise positioning of the system or the effect with blur which was a little impractical

04:48:13.500 --> 04:48:20.220
for a handheld device. The 3D effect did at least make the system stand out to something new but

04:48:20.220 --> 04:48:25.660
in the end this didn't translate well to sales with Nintendo struggling to sell many units outside

04:48:25.660 --> 04:48:33.180
Japan leading to a surprise price cut of $70 only four months after launch. After this sales increased

04:48:33.180 --> 04:48:37.980
but it was a significant sacrifice for Nintendo to make just to get the device off the ground.

04:48:39.260 --> 04:48:44.780
The PlayStation Beta on the other hand launched at the end of 2011 in Japan and in February 2012

04:48:44.780 --> 04:48:51.900
outside Japan meaning it took almost one year longer to release than its rival. Its price of $250

04:48:51.900 --> 04:48:58.860
put it in line with the 3DS's launch price but behind its updated price. Reviews for Sony system

04:48:58.860 --> 04:49:05.740
were also positive with the improved performance, impressive display, rear touchpad and second analog

04:49:05.740 --> 04:49:10.460
stick all helping to make the system stand out as a significant step up from the original PlayStation

04:49:10.460 --> 04:49:16.860
portable. The main criticism was the memory card requirements which created an additional and

04:49:16.860 --> 04:49:21.420
necessary further cost that was made worse by the fact that only Sony brand memory cards worked

04:49:21.420 --> 04:49:27.100
with the device meaning users had no choice but to buy Sony's expensive cards even if they already

04:49:27.100 --> 04:49:33.100
owned other memory cards. Still the Vita did its best to get off to a strong start and boasted a

04:49:33.100 --> 04:49:38.700
relatively big launch lineup of 25 titles which was more than most consoles or handhelds in this

04:49:38.700 --> 04:49:47.260
era. Those games included Uncharted Golden Abyss, Wipeout 2048, FIFA 12 and Rayman Origins.

04:49:48.300 --> 04:49:52.540
The Vita's first year would also see more major releases such as Little Big Planet,

04:49:52.540 --> 04:49:59.100
Persona 4 Golden, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation and Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified as Sony

04:49:59.100 --> 04:50:04.700
tried hard to establish the system's reputation with core gamers. At first this looked like it

04:50:04.700 --> 04:50:10.220
might work with the Vita seeing promising sales at launch but these numbers soon declined and by

04:50:10.220 --> 04:50:18.300
the end of 2012 it had only sold 4 million units well below Sony's expectations and with slow sales

04:50:18.300 --> 04:50:22.940
came a loss of interest from many third-party studios causing Sony to abandon their strategy

04:50:22.940 --> 04:50:27.980
of trying to sell the system through big releases and instead adopt a more indie-centric approach

04:50:27.980 --> 04:50:32.780
where they reached out to mobile and PC developers to try to bring as many promising smaller titles

04:50:32.780 --> 04:50:39.980
to the platform as possible. In August 2013 Sony also dropped the price by $50 alongside a reduction

04:50:39.980 --> 04:50:44.780
in memory cards and in conjunction with the more successful indie focus and the system's strong

04:50:44.780 --> 04:50:51.180
sales in Japan the Vita was able to survive but it never came close to matching its predecessor

04:50:51.180 --> 04:50:58.620
or the 3DS. As for Nintendo they would launch an updated 3DS Excel model in summer 2012 followed

04:50:58.620 --> 04:51:04.220
by a model without the 3D display named the 2DS one year later followed by a new more powerful

04:51:04.220 --> 04:51:11.580
version called the New 3DS in late 2014. Alongside Nintendo's characteristic strong first-party

04:51:11.580 --> 04:51:16.940
lineup and decent third-party support from companies like Square Enix, Konami and Capcom

04:51:16.940 --> 04:51:21.900
this helped keep sales far beyond the Vita. The 3DS would even see the release of a new

04:51:21.900 --> 04:51:26.300
Monster Hunter game from Capcom which had long been one of the PSP's best-selling series.

04:51:27.340 --> 04:51:33.500
Still as dominant as the 3DS was over the Vita it still fell far short of the original DS

04:51:33.500 --> 04:51:41.180
with less than half of its total lifetime sales. The reality was that both the 3DS and Vita were

04:51:41.180 --> 04:51:47.020
solid handheld devices that made significant improvements on their predecessors. The 3DS's

04:51:47.020 --> 04:51:52.220
much-tounted 3D struggled to prove its value in the long term with many players simply turning

04:51:52.220 --> 04:51:56.700
it off for most games once the novelty wore off and the Vita shot itself in the foot with

04:51:56.700 --> 04:52:02.140
how it handled memory cards but in a different era it's easy to imagine both systems finding

04:52:02.140 --> 04:52:08.940
strong commercial success. Still in the end it wasn't a different era and in the 2010s the

04:52:09.020 --> 04:52:13.100
3DS and Vita combined wouldn't even come close to matching the mobile market.

04:52:14.300 --> 04:52:18.380
The harsh reality was that in a world where most people already had smartphones

04:52:18.380 --> 04:52:25.660
dedicated handhelds simply seemed to have too much competition and so for Sony and Nintendo

04:52:25.660 --> 04:52:32.140
this would be the final handheld generation. Nintendo dominated the handheld market for decades

04:52:32.140 --> 04:52:36.620
often with a staggering market share but nothing lasts forever.

04:52:37.260 --> 04:52:42.540
As for mobile gaming it revealed an entirely different side of the industry

04:52:42.540 --> 04:52:47.340
one with different monetization models, different games and different dominant regions.

04:52:48.380 --> 04:52:53.020
For most observers of this the biggest takeaway was the industry's size and growth.

04:52:54.140 --> 04:52:59.740
At the start of the 2010s the mobile industry was still well behind consoles or PC but as the

04:52:59.740 --> 04:53:05.340
decade continued it soon caught up and by the decade's end it was considerably larger than

04:53:05.340 --> 04:53:12.620
all other types of gaming combined. Most mobile games made money through in-app purchases or in-app

04:53:12.620 --> 04:53:17.740
advertising rather than the more traditional buy-to-play model and the amount of money individual

04:53:17.740 --> 04:53:25.020
games could make was staggering. The game with the highest revenue was Arena of Valor also known as

04:53:25.020 --> 04:53:31.260
Honor of Kings in China which is a MOBA made by Chinese gaming giant Tencent that's brought in

04:53:31.260 --> 04:53:40.540
over $14.6 billion since its release in 2015. If numbers that large seem a bit abstract to you

04:53:40.540 --> 04:53:46.780
I like to use the currency called the Bethesda. Microsoft bought Bethesda and the IPs for $7.5

04:53:46.780 --> 04:53:54.220
billion so Arena of Valor's revenue is about 2 Bethesdas. Other high grossing mobile games of

04:53:54.220 --> 04:54:01.100
the decade include the RPG physics game hybrid Monster Strike, Supercell's fantasy themed strategy

04:54:01.100 --> 04:54:08.300
game Clash of Clans, the Battle Royale focused PUBG Mobile, the match 3 RPG hybrid Puzzle and

04:54:08.300 --> 04:54:15.900
Dragons, the more traditional match 3 game Candy Crush Saga and Pokemon Go, an augmented reality

04:54:15.900 --> 04:54:20.300
based Pokemon game from Neantic that received a lot of mainstream attention during its release in

04:54:20.300 --> 04:54:28.540
2016 for its unparalleled ability at making gamers touch grass. It also caused Nintendo's stock to

04:54:28.540 --> 04:54:35.980
increase by 50% in the space of a week. It can be difficult to talk about mobile games without the

04:54:35.980 --> 04:54:41.260
conversation eventually leading back to money whether it's the growth of the industry, the revenue

04:54:41.260 --> 04:54:47.260
of individual games or the methods of monetization that are commonly used. Still for many people

04:54:47.260 --> 04:54:51.420
mobile gaming is about the convenience of games that can be played in short bursts

04:54:51.420 --> 04:54:57.660
wherever you happen to be with little barrier of entry. As the industry is growing to be so large

04:54:57.660 --> 04:55:02.380
it's developed a lot of choice and diversity and as smartphones have continued to become more

04:55:02.380 --> 04:55:07.820
powerful what can be achieved on them has increased at the same time. In the end though

04:55:07.820 --> 04:55:12.780
regardless of people's various opinions on mobile gaming it's impossible to deny the industry

04:55:12.780 --> 04:55:18.780
significance particularly as the trends seen in the mobile industry would soon make their way into

04:55:18.780 --> 04:55:29.900
the gaming mainstream. Online gaming has been steadily growing since the early 90s and the

04:55:29.900 --> 04:55:36.380
2010s were no exception. What would change this decade though was the way online games made money.

04:55:37.580 --> 04:55:42.540
World of Warcraft was a hugely important game not just because it had 12 million active players

04:55:42.540 --> 04:55:46.620
but because those 12 million players were each paying a monthly subscription fee.

04:55:47.660 --> 04:55:52.940
Compared to a more traditional one-time purchase monthly fees were massive but when it came to

04:55:52.940 --> 04:56:00.140
further monetization this was only the beginning. The one-time purchase business model didn't fit

04:56:00.140 --> 04:56:05.820
well with online games that were being continually updated and emphasized long-term engagement and

04:56:05.820 --> 04:56:12.460
so change was inevitable. One of the earliest and most significant examples was Team Fortress 2

04:56:13.020 --> 04:56:16.860
which maintained a steady active player base after its release in 2007

04:56:16.860 --> 04:56:23.340
while receiving regular free updates adding additional content. In 2010 one such update

04:56:23.340 --> 04:56:29.900
allowed players to buy and sell in-game items like hats and the game's revenue immediately

04:56:29.900 --> 04:56:36.460
quadrupled. In 2011 the game was updated to be completely free to play as revenue from

04:56:36.460 --> 04:56:41.820
in-game transactions had come to far exceed those of people purchasing the game and after

04:56:41.820 --> 04:56:48.220
Team Fortress 2 went free to play revenue went up again and the industry took notice.

04:56:49.660 --> 04:56:54.220
At the same time as this new online games like League of Legends were also starting to draw

04:56:54.220 --> 04:56:59.740
in lots of players while making a big profit. League of Legends was also free to play and

04:56:59.740 --> 04:57:05.980
made money through cosmetic skins and purchasable champions. Players could acquire these champions

04:57:05.980 --> 04:57:10.700
through slowly earning in-game currency as they played but many would choose to purchase them

04:57:10.700 --> 04:57:15.180
for real money with more champions and skins being added over time to ensure there was always

04:57:15.180 --> 04:57:21.340
something new to buy. At the time this business model was largely praised with the free to play

04:57:21.340 --> 04:57:26.700
aspect helping the player base grow and the earnable in-game currency providing an alternative

04:57:26.700 --> 04:57:32.780
to needing to spend real money. Of course players did still spend money and as the game's highly

04:57:32.780 --> 04:57:38.300
competitive nature ensured strong replayability the player base grew and grew alongside the game's

04:57:38.300 --> 04:57:43.740
revenue as League of Legends became one of the most played and most successful games of all time.

04:57:45.100 --> 04:57:49.340
Still changing monetization wasn't exclusive to multiplayer games.

04:57:50.860 --> 04:57:56.460
Once upon a time arcade games made big money by making gamers pay to play but some games went

04:57:56.460 --> 04:58:01.820
even further like Double Dragon 3 which featured an in-game shop where players could purchase a

04:58:01.820 --> 04:58:08.860
range of items including new characters weapons and power-ups. This was widely criticized and

04:58:08.860 --> 04:58:14.860
arcades eventually lost popularity making the one-time purchase model of non-arcade games even more

04:58:14.860 --> 04:58:20.860
standard. Older PC games did often sell physical expansion packs that added additional content

04:58:20.860 --> 04:58:26.460
at less than full price and these were generally regarded quite positively as a fair way to expand

04:58:26.460 --> 04:58:32.940
existing games. Things advanced with the arrival of Xbox Live where some games started to provide

04:58:32.940 --> 04:58:39.100
bonus downloadable content usually for free. The Xbox Live marketplace been evolved with

04:58:39.100 --> 04:58:45.180
launch of the 360 and soon featured small pieces of downloadable content at small costs with one

04:58:45.180 --> 04:58:50.300
of the most infamous being the two and a half dollar cosmetic horse armor in the Elder Scrolls 4

04:58:50.300 --> 04:58:57.020
Oblivion. A similar practice was later adopted by Sony and Nintendo at the same time but music

04:58:57.020 --> 04:59:02.460
games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band were gaining popularity while making purchaseable downloadable

04:59:02.460 --> 04:59:10.460
songs a core part of their business model and so smaller or micro transactions were introduced

04:59:10.460 --> 04:59:17.420
to multi and single player games alike. Electronic Arts also introduced micro transactions via in-game

04:59:17.420 --> 04:59:24.300
stores into several existing series like The Sims with its third entry. EA would then add a form

04:59:24.300 --> 04:59:30.540
of luck based micro transaction in the 2009 edition of FIFA something that is now commonly referred

04:59:30.540 --> 04:59:37.100
to as loot boxes. Loot boxes would go on to be added to many other popular online games including

04:59:37.100 --> 04:59:45.900
Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, Battlefield, Call of Duty, League of Legends and more. In 2011

04:59:45.900 --> 04:59:51.180
Rockstar pioneered a new approach by selling content that didn't exist yet in the form of a

04:59:51.180 --> 04:59:57.980
Rockstar pass that could be purchased to unlock future content. Other games like Mortal Kombat and

04:59:57.980 --> 05:00:03.980
Call of Duty soon adopted this season pass approach as well and in Call of Duty this would split the

05:00:03.980 --> 05:00:11.900
player base between those with the season pass maps and those without. In 2012 Capcom's Street Fighter

05:00:11.900 --> 05:00:17.180
tech and crossover drew criticism after including future DLC files on the game's physical disc.

05:00:18.060 --> 05:00:24.060
While in 2013 Dead Space 3 again from EA became one of the first single player focused games to

05:00:24.060 --> 05:00:31.180
offer a purchasable weapon and resource pack to assist players in its campaign. Later games like

05:00:31.180 --> 05:00:36.460
Assassin's Creed Origins from Ubisoft and Middle Earth Shadow of War from Warner Bros would take

05:00:36.460 --> 05:00:43.100
paid advantages in campaigns significantly further and in time microtransactions, in-game stores,

05:00:43.100 --> 05:00:49.820
loot boxes and season passes would all become common practice in many big budget games. Although

05:00:49.820 --> 05:00:55.900
often not without criticism from players, the media and even governmental regulators who have

05:00:55.900 --> 05:01:00.540
likened loot boxes to gambling and raised concerns over their potential harmful impacts.

05:01:02.220 --> 05:01:05.980
Meanwhile gaming companies have often sought to defend these additions by claiming that their

05:01:05.980 --> 05:01:10.780
only providing players with more choice and that increases in video game budgets have occurred

05:01:10.780 --> 05:01:16.220
over time while game prices have stayed relatively flat, meaning further monetization methods have

05:01:16.220 --> 05:01:23.260
become necessary. Still regardless of whether any necessity does truly exist, more monetization

05:01:23.260 --> 05:01:30.300
means more money and businesses don't usually turn down a chance for extra profit. As single

05:01:30.380 --> 05:01:36.380
player focused games are less monetizable, a trend also began towards games as a service,

05:01:36.380 --> 05:01:42.780
or live service games, where AAA games tried to expand into online areas or just placed increased

05:01:42.780 --> 05:01:49.660
focus on future content updates to create continuous engagement from players. The king of live service

05:01:49.660 --> 05:01:55.980
games is unquestionably Grand Theft Auto V, which continued Rockstar's tradition of high quality

05:01:55.980 --> 05:02:01.980
and universally acclaimed open world titles in 2013, but then took things a step further with

05:02:01.980 --> 05:02:09.500
Grand Theft Auto Online. GTA Online allows up to 30 players to freely roam GTA V's world

05:02:09.500 --> 05:02:15.020
while completing lobby-based missions and earning experience points with a focus on general progression,

05:02:15.740 --> 05:02:20.460
and while it did originally have a rocky launch, it soon went on to be hugely successful.

05:02:20.940 --> 05:02:25.900
When Grand Theft Auto V released, it easily surpassed Call of Duty's sales records,

05:02:25.900 --> 05:02:33.660
selling 11.2 million copies in its first 24 hours. Unlike so many of the best selling games before

05:02:33.660 --> 05:02:39.980
it, however, Grand Theft Auto V continued to put out impressive sales figures year after year after

05:02:39.980 --> 05:02:47.020
year. This was partly because of future releases on next-gen consoles and PC, but it was also because

05:02:47.020 --> 05:02:55.180
of the impact and enduring popularity of Grand Theft Auto Online. And so, the gaming industry

05:02:55.180 --> 05:03:01.020
saw how blockbuster single player games could be transformed into blockbuster live service games,

05:03:01.580 --> 05:03:06.460
where they could not only continue to sell more copies due to staying relevant for longer,

05:03:06.460 --> 05:03:11.500
but could also tap into the unbelievably lucrative territory of multiplayer-fuelled

05:03:11.820 --> 05:03:18.620
microtransactions. One year after GTA V, Bungie released their new online-focused first-person

05:03:18.620 --> 05:03:23.020
shooter Destiny, which combined elements of the MMO genre with FPS gameplay.

05:03:24.140 --> 05:03:29.020
Destiny was also very profitable, with publisher Activision claiming it was the most successful

05:03:29.020 --> 05:03:35.420
new gaming franchise launch in history, and between the success of GTA Online and Destiny,

05:03:35.420 --> 05:03:39.180
the live service trend was established and proven beyond doubt.

05:03:40.300 --> 05:03:44.460
Others would soon follow, including several developers that have previously built reputations

05:03:44.460 --> 05:03:51.260
around creating single player games, such as Bioware with Anthem, Bethesda with Fallout 76,

05:03:51.260 --> 05:03:57.900
and Crystal Dynamics with Marvel Avengers. Clearly, not every live service game was a success,

05:03:57.900 --> 05:04:02.620
but for the biggest publishers in the industry, live service offered the biggest rewards,

05:04:02.620 --> 05:04:06.860
and the trend towards live service games is still very much alive today.

05:04:08.300 --> 05:04:13.420
Still, online gaming in the 2010s wasn't just defined by changes to monetization.

05:04:14.460 --> 05:04:18.620
The decade would also see a number of new genres and new takes on existing genres,

05:04:18.620 --> 05:04:25.420
as online gaming expanded upwards and outwards. In 2014, Blizzard's Half Stone achieved major

05:04:25.420 --> 05:04:29.900
success for its accessible and polished take on the digital collectible card game genre.

05:04:30.540 --> 05:04:36.380
In 2015, Rocket League from Xionics combined cars, rockets, and football to create one of

05:04:36.380 --> 05:04:42.060
the decade's freshest sports games. And in 2016, Blizzard's Overwatch received great

05:04:42.060 --> 05:04:47.260
critical acclaim for its team and hero-based FPS design that stood out from most other popular

05:04:47.260 --> 05:04:53.100
shooters at the time. The decade's most popular new genre would come once more from a mod,

05:04:53.660 --> 05:04:58.780
this time from Brendan Green, also known by his online alias, PlayerUnknown,

05:04:58.780 --> 05:05:04.780
who created DayZ Battle Royale, which itself was an offshoot of the DayZ mod for Armor 2.

05:05:06.060 --> 05:05:11.020
Taking inspiration from the Japanese film of the same name, the mod focused on player-vs-player

05:05:11.020 --> 05:05:16.860
combat with a large number of combatants on a big open map. The scale of the map and the

05:05:16.860 --> 05:05:21.500
random placement of weapons was intended to introduce an element of unpredictability,

05:05:21.500 --> 05:05:25.180
and the battleground was designed to get progressively smaller as the games went on

05:05:25.180 --> 05:05:30.860
to ensure regular action. The result turned out to be a hit and would eventually lead to the

05:05:30.860 --> 05:05:37.260
creation of the standalone PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in March 2017 that soon turned Battle

05:05:37.260 --> 05:05:44.220
Royale into a worldwide gaming phenomenon. Seeing the success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,

05:05:44.220 --> 05:05:49.260
Epic Games decided to create a Battle Royale mod for their upcoming construction shooter hybrid

05:05:49.260 --> 05:05:55.980
Fortnite to create Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017, and between the two games the

05:05:55.980 --> 05:06:02.540
gaming industry was never quite the same again. Fortnite and PUBG offered different takes on

05:06:02.540 --> 05:06:08.860
the same idea, with PUBG being more focused and prioritizing realism, and Fortnite standing out

05:06:08.860 --> 05:06:14.460
thanks to its building mechanics and more cartoony aesthetic. The games would also fare differently

05:06:14.460 --> 05:06:20.060
in different markets, with PUBG being a massive success in Asia and Fortnite finding dominance

05:06:20.060 --> 05:06:26.300
over school yards across America and Europe. Still, one thing both games had in common was

05:06:26.300 --> 05:06:32.460
being staggeringly successful. PUBG quickly broke the record for most concurrent players on Steam

05:06:32.460 --> 05:06:39.260
with over 3.2 million, which was about 2 million more than the next highest game on record, and soon

05:06:39.260 --> 05:06:44.460
Fortnite was able to boast even greater numbers. Many other Battle Royale games followed in their

05:06:44.460 --> 05:06:51.740
wake, some successful, some not, some higher budget, some low, some shooters, some anything but, and

05:06:51.740 --> 05:06:56.540
while most of these would not find long-term popularity, that didn't stop plenty of developers

05:06:56.540 --> 05:07:03.100
from trying anyway. The 2010s were also the decade where online gaming spread beyond games.

05:07:03.340 --> 05:07:08.220
Gaming tournaments had been around for a long time, and by the 90s some were even quite large,

05:07:08.220 --> 05:07:13.900
like the Nintendo World Championships in 1990, or the Evolution Championship Series for fighting

05:07:13.900 --> 05:07:21.580
games starting in 1996. In the 2000s, televised coverage started to be more popular, particularly

05:07:21.580 --> 05:07:26.460
in South Korea, where StarCraft was well on its way to becoming the new national religion.

05:07:26.620 --> 05:07:33.180
In the mid-2000s, esports history was made at EVO 2004, when Daigo Umehara, playing as Ken in

05:07:33.180 --> 05:07:36.780
Street Fighter III, performed the Daigo Parry.

05:07:56.860 --> 05:08:08.780
The 15-hit consecutive parry, with only one pixel of health remaining, into a comeback victory that

05:08:08.780 --> 05:08:14.300
would see Umehara through to the finals, has since been described as the most iconic moment in

05:08:14.300 --> 05:08:20.700
competitive gaming history. It was also a perfect showcase for the potential appeal of esports,

05:08:20.700 --> 05:08:27.900
and by 2010 that potential was quickly becoming reality. New online streaming services opened

05:08:27.900 --> 05:08:33.980
esports to a much wider audience, and with more popularity would come greater prize money and

05:08:33.980 --> 05:08:40.540
bigger stages, as StarCraft, Counter-Strike, League of Legends and Dota all helped push esports into

05:08:40.540 --> 05:08:46.780
the mainstream. With time, more and more games would follow as the numbers kept rising, and by

05:08:46.780 --> 05:08:53.900
2019, Dota 2's The International tournament had a total prize pool of over 34 million dollars,

05:08:53.900 --> 05:09:00.460
and League of Legends 2019 World Championships would see a peak of 44 million concurrent viewers.

05:09:01.820 --> 05:09:05.580
Over the course of the decade, esports became big business,

05:09:05.580 --> 05:09:08.540
but people weren't only watching competitive gaming.

05:09:09.980 --> 05:09:14.220
Livestreaming and Let's Plays, made possible by platforms like Twitch and YouTube,

05:09:14.220 --> 05:09:18.460
also rose to popularity in the first half of the decade, becoming a major new tool for

05:09:18.460 --> 05:09:22.780
video game marketing and drawing great amounts of attention to certain titles.

05:09:23.980 --> 05:09:29.260
Horror games like Amnesia the Dark Descent and Five Nights at Freddy's, or the social

05:09:29.260 --> 05:09:35.500
deduction game Among Us, stand out as examples of how small games with little marketing can still

05:09:35.500 --> 05:09:43.020
have massive impacts through this new online social media-fuelled ecosystem. Social media also

05:09:43.020 --> 05:09:49.340
brought a greater focus to various controversies. Video games and controversy have long been

05:09:49.340 --> 05:09:55.980
acquainted. For example, Mortal Kombat and Night Trap in 1993, Doom following the Columbine shooting

05:09:55.980 --> 05:10:01.740
in 1999, Grand 5th Auto San Andreas following the discovery of the hot coffee mod in 2005,

05:10:02.460 --> 05:10:07.420
Panic over the MMO genre following the success of World Warcraft, and Call of Duty Model

05:10:07.420 --> 05:10:13.980
Morpher 2's Civilian Killing No Russian Mission in 2009 all provide examples of major gaming

05:10:13.980 --> 05:10:20.220
controversies, but all of these past examples had one thing in common, which was that the

05:10:20.220 --> 05:10:27.180
controversy was caused by people outside of the gaming industry looking in. In the 2010s however,

05:10:27.180 --> 05:10:32.540
controversy started coming from within, while becoming more frequent and more intense.

05:10:32.540 --> 05:10:38.700
One of the earliest examples of this was the ending for Mass Effect 3, which fans viewed as

05:10:38.700 --> 05:10:43.420
disappointing for the similarity between different endings and for their failure to represent players'

05:10:43.420 --> 05:10:48.940
choices over the trilogy. The negative response led to an open letter from Bioware's founder,

05:10:49.500 --> 05:10:54.060
charity drives from fans, statements from the Federal Trade Commission and Better Business

05:10:54.060 --> 05:11:01.580
Bureau, a revised extended cut DLC, a significant number of cupcakes, and a disparaging parody

05:11:01.580 --> 05:11:22.380
from Weird Owl. For a disappointing game, this level of negative attention was unprecedented,

05:11:22.380 --> 05:11:25.580
but it turned out this was just a taste of what was to come.

05:11:25.660 --> 05:11:33.340
In 2014, gaming media and gaming communities embraced the political culture war with Gamergate,

05:11:33.340 --> 05:11:36.620
and both have been vigorously arguing about politics ever since.

05:11:37.900 --> 05:11:44.060
But there were also controversies over monetization, like with Middle Earth Shadow of War, Star Wars

05:11:44.060 --> 05:11:50.220
Battlefront 2 and Genshin Impact, controversies over the disappointing state games released in,

05:11:50.220 --> 05:11:57.900
like with No Man's Sky, Fallout 76 and Cyberpunk 2077, controversies over working conditions and

05:11:57.900 --> 05:12:05.100
crunch periods at studios, like with Bioware, Rockstar and Naughty Dog, controversies over sexual

05:12:05.100 --> 05:12:12.780
misconduct, like with Riot Games, Ubisoft and Blizzard, controversies over graphical downgrades,

05:12:12.780 --> 05:12:18.540
controversies over DRM, controversies over lack of accreditation, controversies over lack of

05:12:18.540 --> 05:12:23.340
difficulty options, controversies over games releasing too soon, controversies over games

05:12:23.340 --> 05:12:28.380
releasing too late, controversies over story decisions, controversies over censorship,

05:12:28.380 --> 05:12:33.820
controversies over translations, controversies over voice acting pay, controversies over cameos,

05:12:33.820 --> 05:12:37.980
controversies over original authors, controversies over political representation,

05:12:37.980 --> 05:12:43.580
gender representation, sexual representation, racial representation and religious representation,

05:12:43.580 --> 05:12:48.220
and controversies over controversy and controversies over a lack of controversy,

05:12:48.860 --> 05:12:53.420
and you could probably drag this section out even further if one were so inclined.

05:12:54.700 --> 05:12:59.180
It's worth keeping in mind that for media outlets and online content creators,

05:12:59.180 --> 05:13:03.260
controversy is one of the best ways to make money, and people are willing to do whatever

05:13:03.260 --> 05:13:08.860
they can to encourage it. More surprising though is how much consumers seem to have embraced this

05:13:08.860 --> 05:13:13.740
approach and how difficult it's become to avoid this constant focus on controversy

05:13:13.740 --> 05:13:20.540
within gaming communities as a result. And so, the 2010s were a decade where the internet changed

05:13:20.540 --> 05:13:27.740
many things, and video games were no exception. Still, while not all of these changes were positive,

05:13:27.740 --> 05:13:32.700
the internet did allow for one part of the industry to flourish like never before.

05:13:39.820 --> 05:13:45.820
After major breakthroughs in the 2000s, independent game development continued to thrive in the 2010s.

05:13:46.860 --> 05:13:51.580
This period saw mainstream games growing cost and development time, which often led studios to

05:13:51.580 --> 05:13:56.220
taking increasingly conservative approaches by sticking to proven genres and series.

05:13:57.340 --> 05:14:01.180
Meanwhile, the smaller budgets of indie games meant they only needed a fraction of the sales

05:14:01.180 --> 05:14:05.820
to be profitable, meaning developers could still succeed by appealing to niche audiences

05:14:05.820 --> 05:14:13.420
or through taking greater risks. The result was a huge amount of diversity, from genre to art style,

05:14:13.420 --> 05:14:18.940
to level of accessibility or more, as indie games brought variety at a time when the industry

05:14:18.940 --> 05:14:23.980
needed it the most, which can be shown clearly by looking back through some of the decades most

05:14:23.980 --> 05:14:30.780
critically and commercially successful titles. 2010 saw the release of Playdead's darkly atmospheric

05:14:30.780 --> 05:14:36.940
experiential puzzle game Limbo, and Team Meat's fast-paced and fiendishly difficult 2D platformer

05:14:36.940 --> 05:14:43.020
Super Meat Boy. 2011 would bring a new take on the rogue-like genre with the binding of Isaac,

05:14:43.020 --> 05:14:47.980
which added action gameplay and Zelda-inspired procedurally-generated dungeons as players helped

05:14:47.980 --> 05:14:54.380
Isaac escape his abusive mother. Relogix Terraria also released that year with the expansive 2D

05:14:54.380 --> 05:15:00.220
sandbox game going on to sell 44 million copies, making it one of the best-selling games of all

05:15:00.220 --> 05:15:06.540
time. In 2012, Journey from that game company impressed many with its striking use of visuals,

05:15:06.540 --> 05:15:10.540
audio and non-verbal storytelling that would help it win several Game of the Year awards,

05:15:11.180 --> 05:15:16.860
whereas Deniton Games' top-down shooter Hotline Miami came in hard with a mix of ultraviolence

05:15:16.860 --> 05:15:23.900
and surrealism to provide a somewhat contrasting experience. 2013's Paper's Please from Lucas

05:15:23.900 --> 05:15:28.860
Pope tested players' morality by putting them in the shoes of an immigration inspector at a border

05:15:28.860 --> 05:15:36.700
checkpoint in the glorious dystopia of Aristosca. In 2014, Yacht Club Games 8-bit side-scrolling

05:15:36.700 --> 05:15:42.060
platformer Shovel Knight paid homage to the gaming's past while impressing with cutting-edge controls

05:15:42.060 --> 05:15:49.420
and level design. 2015's Undertale from Toby Fox provided a clever twist on RPG conventions

05:15:49.420 --> 05:15:56.460
and created an enduring fandom alongside one of gaming's greatest soundtracks. In 2016,

05:15:56.460 --> 05:16:00.860
video game players that wanted to avoid going outside were positively spoilt for choice.

05:16:01.500 --> 05:16:06.540
Concerned Ape's Stardew Valley became a sensation for its open-ended and relaxing take on the farming

05:16:06.540 --> 05:16:12.380
sim genre. Plactorio from Woop Software gave players an endlessly deep factory and automation

05:16:12.380 --> 05:16:18.220
simulator while establishing its own genre in the process, and Rimworld from Ludeon Studios

05:16:18.220 --> 05:16:23.420
combined base-building and emergent storytelling in its addictive and relatively accessible take

05:16:23.420 --> 05:16:29.740
on the colony's sim genre. Meanwhile, 2017 seemed determined to test players' skills

05:16:29.740 --> 05:16:36.220
with the demanding and impeccably presented Cuphead from Studio MDHR that had players running,

05:16:36.220 --> 05:16:41.980
gunning and repeatedly dying to its many creative boss fights, and Hollow Knight from Team Cherry,

05:16:41.980 --> 05:16:47.020
an expansive and surprisingly epic Metroidvania that had players take on the role of a nameless

05:16:47.020 --> 05:16:53.980
knight as you explore the Fallen Kingdom of Hallownest. In 2018, Subset Games Into the Breach

05:16:53.980 --> 05:16:59.020
offered strategy fans something new by stripping away much of a genre to place all the focus on

05:16:59.020 --> 05:17:05.980
its rich, tactically engaging turn-based gameplay. 2019 would see the release of Megacrit's much

05:17:05.980 --> 05:17:11.340
copied yet never bested road-like deckbuilder Slay the Spire, as well as Mobius Digital's

05:17:11.340 --> 05:17:16.380
time-loop adventure game Outer Wilds that gave players complete freedom to explore its miniature

05:17:16.380 --> 05:17:23.180
solar system as they unraveled the mysteries of its unforgettable universe. Finally, in 2020,

05:17:23.180 --> 05:17:28.700
Supergiant Games wowed the world with the action-roke like Hades, a game with so much content

05:17:28.700 --> 05:17:33.340
and such high-quality presentation that it almost seems to have left the indie label behind.

05:17:34.780 --> 05:17:39.020
Indie games have come a long way, to the point where the term indie

05:17:39.020 --> 05:17:45.580
increasingly tells you very little. Once upon a time, the word seemed to imply certain characteristics,

05:17:45.580 --> 05:17:51.900
like games that are short, cheap, retro or artsy. Yet, by the end of the decade,

05:17:51.900 --> 05:17:58.300
indie could imply almost anything, with massive companies like Ubisoft, EA and Tencent all creating

05:17:58.300 --> 05:18:03.980
games in traditionally indie styles, all while independent developers increasingly create games

05:18:03.980 --> 05:18:10.700
with a level of ambition, size or presentation comparable to many big-name studios. It's also

05:18:10.700 --> 05:18:14.780
worth noting that there are many other games that could have been mentioned in this section as well,

05:18:14.780 --> 05:18:17.740
and it is a testament to the strength of the indie market,

05:18:17.740 --> 05:18:21.900
just how spoiled the choice you are when looking for high-quality games to highlight.

05:18:23.180 --> 05:18:26.700
Still, the vast number of indie games being developed over the past decade

05:18:26.700 --> 05:18:31.740
became a talking point in itself, with many raising concerns that so many indie games

05:18:31.740 --> 05:18:35.580
makes it harder and harder for indie developers to get noticed and find success.

05:18:36.940 --> 05:18:41.340
As the indie market seemed to be reaching a point of saturation in the later half of the decade,

05:18:41.340 --> 05:18:46.940
the term indie-pocalypse started to be used to refer to this situation, and yet while increased

05:18:46.940 --> 05:18:52.220
competition may have made success harder, there has been no sign of an indie market collapse,

05:18:52.220 --> 05:18:58.780
and good games continue to be released. This continued rise of indie gaming also brought

05:18:58.780 --> 05:19:04.620
a number of related trends. Minecraft paved the way for the concept of early access,

05:19:04.620 --> 05:19:09.100
where many indie games would release unfinished and receive continuous updates over time.

05:19:09.100 --> 05:19:15.260
This helped establish new genres, like survival games, while also aiding developers by assisting

05:19:15.260 --> 05:19:19.500
with funding during development and making it easier to incorporate player feedback.

05:19:20.540 --> 05:19:24.460
The downside of this system was that it could also lead to anti-consumer practices

05:19:24.460 --> 05:19:29.580
of misleading advertising, over-promising, or just abandoning games unfinished after

05:19:29.580 --> 05:19:35.740
receiving players' money. Still, for every standout early access disaster, it's easy to find

05:19:35.740 --> 05:19:42.700
other standout successes. Alongside early access, the 2010s also saw the rise of crowdfunding in

05:19:42.700 --> 05:19:48.540
game development, usually through the platform Kickstarter. This often involved respected

05:19:48.540 --> 05:19:53.500
figures within the industry wanting to bring back classic series or genres that publishers deemed

05:19:53.500 --> 05:19:59.420
too risky to fund, and crowdfunding games could vary between relatively big games from already

05:19:59.500 --> 05:20:03.820
well-established studios to much smaller projects from individual developers.

05:20:05.100 --> 05:20:09.980
With time, many crowdfunded games were released, and amongst them were many of the decades most

05:20:09.980 --> 05:20:15.900
acclaimed indie games, but there were also plenty of notable failures, from MMOs accused of being

05:20:15.900 --> 05:20:21.980
scams to games that critically bombed or just games that never released at all. Through the

05:20:21.980 --> 05:20:27.100
combination of crowdfunding and indie growth, the 2010s would see a lot of genre revivals,

05:20:27.100 --> 05:20:31.660
particularly from those once popular in the past that don't fit well with modern AAA game design.

05:20:32.780 --> 05:20:39.660
These included RTS games, point-and-click adventures, CRPGs, shoot-'em-ups, boomer-shooters,

05:20:39.660 --> 05:20:44.780
space sims, classic survival horror, beat-'em-ups, FMV games, and many more.

05:20:45.900 --> 05:20:51.180
Retro-inspired games in particular saw a resurgence in the 2010s, possibly because people who once

05:20:51.180 --> 05:20:55.900
grew up with older games were now old enough to create games themselves and took inspiration from

05:20:55.900 --> 05:21:01.420
their favourite games of the past, but also because the smaller budgets of indie games fit well

05:21:01.420 --> 05:21:07.420
with retro-inspired design. And developers weren't the only ones making games this decade.

05:21:08.300 --> 05:21:12.620
One of the most played games at the end of the decade, and one of the most confusing for older

05:21:12.620 --> 05:21:18.620
generations, was Roblox, a game creation platform that allows users to share their own games inside

05:21:18.620 --> 05:21:24.540
its engine. Roblox attained great popularity with younger generations, probably as much

05:21:24.540 --> 05:21:31.260
like Minecraft before it, it tapped into players' natural creativity. Finally, the 2010s would also

05:21:31.260 --> 05:21:36.700
see game development go global as indie development and digital distribution opened the industry up

05:21:36.700 --> 05:21:42.140
to more regions around the world. Still, as the ninth generation of consoles finally approached

05:21:42.140 --> 05:21:46.860
in the latter half of the decade, the attention would once more return to Japan.

05:21:55.100 --> 05:22:01.180
No company has more experience in the gaming industry than Nintendo. But in 2012,

05:22:01.180 --> 05:22:06.860
the gaming veteran experienced something new. As for the first time since entering the industry,

05:22:06.940 --> 05:22:14.700
Nintendo would see a financial loss for the year, of $366 million. In 2013,

05:22:14.700 --> 05:22:20.540
they would report similar losses, and in 2014, those losses would grow even greater.

05:22:21.580 --> 05:22:27.020
The Wii U was a failure, but for the first time, Nintendo was starting to fail as well.

05:22:28.460 --> 05:22:33.820
They had never been further behind in the console race. The once reliable handheld market was rapidly

05:22:33.820 --> 05:22:38.860
shrinking, and unlike certain other big names, they didn't have additional areas of business

05:22:38.860 --> 05:22:45.980
outside of gaming. Video games were basically everything to them. And this is the climate in

05:22:45.980 --> 05:22:52.940
which they would create their next and possibly last console. Nintendo's growing desperation

05:22:52.940 --> 05:22:58.700
was visible long before their next console would be ready. In 2014, the company headscrafted a new

05:22:58.700 --> 05:23:04.780
strategy to turn their finances around. A key part of this was to reverse their earliest stance

05:23:04.780 --> 05:23:10.060
on mobile gaming. Originally, Nintendo wanted to preserve the quality of their franchises,

05:23:10.060 --> 05:23:15.340
and continue their practice of only allowing Nintendo games on Nintendo hardware. But now,

05:23:15.340 --> 05:23:20.220
they were looking to enter the mobile market in an attempt to maximize their intellectual property,

05:23:20.860 --> 05:23:26.060
leading to core Nintendo series like Super Mario, Animal Crossing, and Mario Kart,

05:23:26.060 --> 05:23:31.580
making their mobile debuts. This was also the time that Nintendo launched Amiibo,

05:23:31.580 --> 05:23:35.820
a toys to life figure series that had built-in functionality with certain Nintendo games.

05:23:37.020 --> 05:23:42.700
Still, as useful as additional monetization might be, Nintendo still knew the deciding factor would

05:23:42.700 --> 05:23:51.500
always be their next console. So, how do you respond to record losses and your greatest ever failure?

05:23:51.500 --> 05:23:57.580
Well, Nintendo's answer was to double down and try the same thing again.

05:23:58.780 --> 05:24:04.700
And so, once more, Nintendo would avoid competing with their rivals in terms of power. Once more,

05:24:04.700 --> 05:24:09.420
they would focus the console around a portable screen, and once more, they would target the same

05:24:09.420 --> 05:24:14.380
audience with the same intent to bridge the gap between serious and more casual gamers.

05:24:15.740 --> 05:24:20.940
Still, far from creating a Wii U 2, this console would instead learn from the Wii U's mistakes

05:24:20.940 --> 05:24:25.740
and address its greatest shortcomings, providing true portability without needing to stay close

05:24:25.740 --> 05:24:31.180
to a console, as well as better battery life, a more comfortable and versatile design, and of

05:24:31.180 --> 05:24:39.020
course, less confusing marketing. Officially announced in October 2016 after years of fan rumors

05:24:39.020 --> 05:24:44.860
and released in March the following year, the Nintendo Switch was a gamble. By this point,

05:24:44.860 --> 05:24:48.700
many Nintendo fans were sick of being behind the competition in terms of power,

05:24:48.700 --> 05:24:54.620
and were frustrated by Nintendo's continued focus on gimmicks. The Nintendo Switch ignored this.

05:24:55.580 --> 05:24:59.420
Similarly, the Nintendo 3DS, while less successful than its predecessor,

05:24:59.420 --> 05:25:04.300
was still Nintendo's best-selling system at the time, and by creating a new portable device,

05:25:04.300 --> 05:25:09.180
Nintendo were risking competition with their own system, while also combining their two

05:25:09.180 --> 05:25:14.140
main existing revenue streams. What's more, after several disappointing years,

05:25:14.140 --> 05:25:18.140
Nintendo were fast approaching the point where they simply couldn't afford another

05:25:18.140 --> 05:25:23.260
lackluster launch, and following the reveal, plenty of onlookers were expressing doubts.

05:25:24.620 --> 05:25:30.060
But in the end, those doubts would not be founded. The Switch launched strong.

05:25:30.860 --> 05:25:36.620
By the end of March, it had sold 2.74 million units, exceeding Nintendo's expectations.

05:25:37.820 --> 05:25:43.580
Nintendo responded by increasing production capacity. The Switch responded by continuing to sell.

05:25:44.460 --> 05:25:48.700
Nintendo upped their forecast for the financial year, aiming for 10 million units sold,

05:25:48.700 --> 05:25:52.540
and the Switch then upped its sales again, meeting this target with months to spare.

05:25:53.500 --> 05:25:57.500
By the end of its first year, the scale of Nintendo's success was starting to be revealed.

05:25:58.220 --> 05:26:03.580
It would take the Switch less than 12 months to overtake for lifetime sales of the Wii U,

05:26:03.580 --> 05:26:08.300
and in the process, it became the fastest-selling games console in history.

05:26:08.380 --> 05:26:15.020
Things change quickly in the gaming industry, but sometimes they change in your favor.

05:26:16.220 --> 05:26:19.980
There is no single reason for the Switch's record-breaking success,

05:26:19.980 --> 05:26:24.060
and its reception from reviewers was no more positive than the Wii U before it.

05:26:25.100 --> 05:26:29.420
The portability of the system is a clear upgrade from its predecessor, and the Switch may have

05:26:29.420 --> 05:26:34.460
benefited more from a lack of handheld competition, as while smartphones were more common than ever,

05:26:34.540 --> 05:26:38.780
the Switch offered something much more traditional and substantial than mobile gaming did,

05:26:38.780 --> 05:26:40.700
which might have appealed to a different audience.

05:26:41.980 --> 05:26:44.780
It may also have benefited from the failure of the Wii U.

05:26:45.980 --> 05:26:50.540
Nintendo learned from the earlier system's hardware and marketing to make needed improvements

05:26:50.540 --> 05:26:55.420
on their second attempt, and the Wii U's underplayed library also gave Nintendo the

05:26:55.420 --> 05:27:00.220
perfect opportunity to port many of its best games over to their newer system to quickly

05:27:00.220 --> 05:27:03.740
expand the Switch's lineup and ensure the system got off to a strong start.

05:27:04.940 --> 05:27:10.940
And speaking of games, the Switch certainly had its share, including a launch title that

05:27:10.940 --> 05:27:14.620
may have been the first true killer app seen in more than a decade.

05:27:15.660 --> 05:27:20.700
The legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild, is one of the most highly acclaimed games in history.

05:27:21.740 --> 05:27:27.100
By taking Zelda Open World, it gave new life to the Zelda series and the Open World genre,

05:27:27.180 --> 05:27:32.060
with a more hands-off and exploration-driven approach to game design that many felt represented

05:27:32.060 --> 05:27:37.100
what had been lacking from many other games of the modern era. Breath of the Wild was a

05:27:37.100 --> 05:27:42.940
true system seller, and its sales clearly show this, as it accounted for almost 50% of the

05:27:42.940 --> 05:27:47.500
Switch's early software sales, with the game selling nearly one-to-one with the console.

05:27:48.940 --> 05:27:54.060
Launching with a mainline Zelda title, let alone one of the best-received Zelda titles in history,

05:27:54.060 --> 05:27:59.500
is always a significant advantage for a console, but the Switch's first year included more hits

05:27:59.500 --> 05:28:05.100
than just Breath of the Wild. Soon after its release, it would receive its all-time best-selling

05:28:05.100 --> 05:28:11.260
game by way of the ever-popular Mario Kart 8, which was an expanded version of the Wii U title,

05:28:11.260 --> 05:28:15.980
as well as a well-received sequel to third-person territory control game Splatoon,

05:28:15.980 --> 05:28:21.340
and even a new 3D Mario game in Super Mario Odyssey, which gave the Switch

05:28:21.340 --> 05:28:27.420
its second critically adored, must-own title. In a time when consoles were increasingly launching

05:28:27.420 --> 05:28:32.700
with weaker and weaker line-ups, and had less and less exclusive games, the Switch finished its

05:28:32.700 --> 05:28:39.180
first year looking like a true heavyweight, with plenty more still to come. And as the Nintendo

05:28:39.180 --> 05:28:43.500
Switch got off to a great start, it pretty much solved Nintendo's long-running third-party

05:28:43.500 --> 05:28:48.620
support problem, as many developers no longer wanted to miss out on the Switch's larger user base.

05:28:48.860 --> 05:28:55.100
But it wasn't just Nintendo who would have a good year in 2017, and it wasn't just Nintendo

05:28:55.100 --> 05:29:01.420
who needed such a year. After the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in 1985, Japan

05:29:01.420 --> 05:29:07.340
dominated the gaming industry for over 30 years, but as gaming moved to high definition,

05:29:07.340 --> 05:29:13.820
this quickly started to change. More and more of the best-selling and highest-reviewed games

05:29:14.780 --> 05:29:21.020
were coming to be from outside Japan, with major Japanese series like Final Fantasy and Gran Turismo

05:29:21.020 --> 05:29:26.060
seeming to experience longer, more drawn-out development periods and a decline in critical

05:29:26.060 --> 05:29:32.380
and fan reception. In this period, a new trend began of Japanese studios outsourcing established

05:29:32.380 --> 05:29:39.660
franchises to Western developers, something that was once almost unheard of. And this wasn't just

05:29:39.740 --> 05:29:47.020
small unknown series either, it included some big and beloved names like Resident Evil, Silent Hill,

05:29:47.020 --> 05:29:54.780
Devil May Cry, Dead Rising, Castlevania, Contra, and more. The worst part of his trend was that

05:29:54.780 --> 05:29:59.260
almost every one of these games was received far more poorly than the older Japanese-developed

05:29:59.260 --> 05:30:05.100
games of the same series. Meanwhile, other major Japanese publishers like Square Enix would make

05:30:05.180 --> 05:30:10.060
moves to acquire Western-based developers in order to adapt to the changing market demands.

05:30:11.100 --> 05:30:16.220
Konami went even further by going on to abandon games altogether in favour of focusing on

05:30:16.220 --> 05:30:21.980
gambling and the pachinko market, while industry giant Sony shifted their focus far more heavily

05:30:21.980 --> 05:30:28.700
towards Western developers and Western audiences. And this was more than just a change in where

05:30:28.700 --> 05:30:35.820
development was taking place. From 2007 to 2012, the Japanese gaming industry shrank for

05:30:35.820 --> 05:30:42.140
five years in a row, and the only major Japanese developer doing well in this period was Nintendo,

05:30:42.140 --> 05:30:49.260
who were about to release the Wii U. And so, as the Japanese gaming industry stumbled and fell,

05:30:49.260 --> 05:30:54.940
a lot of people started to take notice. The views of the general gaming populace were perhaps best

05:30:54.940 --> 05:31:01.340
summarised by once-popular indie developer Phil Fish when asked what he thought of recent Japanese games.

05:31:24.940 --> 05:31:40.860
As tone-deaf as this might now seem, at the time, Fish really was just saying something many people

05:31:40.860 --> 05:31:46.140
were thinking, and it wasn't just Western developers and journalists. Japanese developers

05:31:46.140 --> 05:31:50.940
were also highly critical, and it's not an exaggeration to say that the Japanese industry

05:31:50.940 --> 05:31:56.060
was experiencing a genuine crisis that was made even more dramatic by how much of a fool from

05:31:56.060 --> 05:32:04.780
grace it seemed to represent. But in 2017, this would finally change, as Japan took back its crown.

05:32:06.300 --> 05:32:12.620
It began before the year even started. At the very end of 2016, two games famous for being stuck in

05:32:12.620 --> 05:32:20.460
development hell finally released. Final Fantasy XV was first shown in 2006. The Last Guardian,

05:32:20.460 --> 05:32:26.380
the next game from the team behind Ico and Shadow of Colossus, was first announced in early 2007.

05:32:27.260 --> 05:32:33.020
Ten years later, after much anticipation, derision and desperation, these games finally made it to

05:32:33.020 --> 05:32:39.260
the public, and both were received positively. But this was only a taste of what was to come.

05:32:39.660 --> 05:32:45.660
January 2017, Resident Evil 7 released two critical acclaim after the previous mainline entry was

05:32:45.660 --> 05:32:51.740
widely panned, and achieved success by returning the series to its survival horror roots. The very

05:32:51.740 --> 05:32:57.180
same day, Yakuza Zero released in the West, becoming the most successful Yakuza game of all time,

05:32:57.180 --> 05:33:03.580
and popularizing the series outside Japan. In February, Neo released ending developer Ninja

05:33:04.540 --> 05:33:08.940
Theory's long run of poorly received titles, and becoming their most highly acclaimed game

05:33:08.940 --> 05:33:15.660
since Ninja Gaiden in 2004. March brought Neo Automata, which released a critical acclaim,

05:33:15.660 --> 05:33:20.700
becoming the first game from beloved oddball game director Yoko Taro to reach mainstream audiences.

05:33:21.500 --> 05:33:26.460
This was the same month that the Nintendo Switch and Breath of the Wild also made their debut.

05:33:27.740 --> 05:33:33.180
April continued with Persona 5, which became the most highly reviewed JRPG since Final Fantasy 9

05:33:33.260 --> 05:33:37.820
in 2000, while also making thousands of people online say the words,

05:33:37.820 --> 05:33:44.060
I don't usually like JRPGs, but... Something worth keeping in mind here is that

05:33:44.060 --> 05:33:50.700
Yakuza Zero, Neo, Neo Automata, and Persona 5 all released as PlayStation exclusives in the first

05:33:50.700 --> 05:34:00.140
half of 2017, all received great reviews, and all sold millions of copies. And yet, at E3 2016,

05:34:00.140 --> 05:34:05.500
Sony wouldn't promote any of these four games. They ended up as some of the best

05:34:05.500 --> 05:34:11.100
PlayStation exclusives in years on a console that was, at the time, light on exclusives,

05:34:11.100 --> 05:34:17.260
and yet Sony had refused to show any of them in favor of focusing on multi-platform games like

05:34:17.260 --> 05:34:24.860
Call of Duty, Modern Warfare Remastered, and LEGO Star Wars, The Force Awakens. This was probably

05:34:24.860 --> 05:34:30.700
because these games simply looked to Japanese, and despite being a Japanese company, Sony seemed

05:34:30.700 --> 05:34:36.460
to decide that showing such Japanese looking games could be bad for their brand. This was the

05:34:36.460 --> 05:34:41.820
situation Japanese games were in, at least this was the situation in the eyes of the biggest

05:34:41.820 --> 05:34:48.940
Japanese games company in the world, until 2017 happened. June brought the triumph in return of

05:34:48.940 --> 05:34:54.300
one of gaming's most iconic fighting series, Tekken, after an 8 year absence. July brought

05:34:54.300 --> 05:34:59.740
the release of Dragon Quest XI, only in Japan and yet Japan alone was enough to reach 5 million copies

05:34:59.740 --> 05:35:05.980
sold. August brought the return of 2D Sonic in Sonic Mania, a game not made by Japanese developers,

05:35:05.980 --> 05:35:10.620
but instead by several Sonic fans, and yet it went on to give the iconic Japanese series its best

05:35:10.620 --> 05:35:15.900
reviewed game since the Dreamcast. September brought the return of Metroid in Samus Returns,

05:35:15.900 --> 05:35:21.660
seven years after the last Metroid game, and 13 years since the last 2D Metroid. October brought

05:35:21.660 --> 05:35:26.220
Super Mario Odyssey, and December rounded the year off with Xenoblade Chronicles 2,

05:35:26.220 --> 05:35:30.300
the best selling game in the long running Xeno series, and another reason for Switch and

05:35:30.300 --> 05:35:36.620
JRPG fans to be happy that year. For video games, some years are better than others,

05:35:36.620 --> 05:35:42.780
and 2017 was without doubt one of the best of the modern era. There were good western and indie

05:35:42.780 --> 05:35:48.220
games released that year as well, but it was Japanese developers who stole the show, and the idea that

05:35:48.220 --> 05:35:54.620
the Japanese games industry was falling behind, or dying, would be permanently dispelled ever since.

05:35:55.820 --> 05:36:00.540
Nintendo and the Switch would find further success in the following years, with major titles like

05:36:00.540 --> 05:36:06.220
Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizon, and many many Pokemon games.

05:36:07.420 --> 05:36:12.620
Still, as the decade reached its end, attention would return once more to the other two major

05:36:12.620 --> 05:36:17.660
giants of gaming as their next generation of consoles were getting ready to finally release.

05:36:18.700 --> 05:36:33.100
The most interesting thing about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X is how uninteresting they are.

05:36:34.140 --> 05:36:38.300
Once upon a time, different gaming consoles were entirely distinct species,

05:36:38.300 --> 05:36:43.340
but look past for deceptively varied exteriors of Sony's and Microsoft's latest efforts,

05:36:43.340 --> 05:36:51.180
and you'll find near identical pieces of hardware. AMD 8 core Zen 2 CPUs, AMD Radeon

05:36:51.180 --> 05:36:57.180
R DNA GPUs, similar SSD drives, similar promises in resolution and frame rate,

05:36:57.180 --> 05:37:01.980
similar backwards compatibility, similar disc and digital only variants,

05:37:01.980 --> 05:37:06.700
similar prices, although the digital only Xbox is cheaper and less powerful,

05:37:06.700 --> 05:37:11.820
and a similar release date, which basically means, unless you're a tech enthusiast,

05:37:11.820 --> 05:37:18.060
a dedicated fanboy or girl, or a paid marketer, there isn't anything important separating the

05:37:18.060 --> 05:37:24.220
two machines at a technical level. The real proof of this is in multi-platform performance,

05:37:25.020 --> 05:37:31.740
where once the 360 beat the PS3, and then the PS4 beat the Xbox One, now there's no clear difference.

05:37:32.700 --> 05:37:36.940
Some games might perform better on one system over the other, but even then the differences

05:37:36.940 --> 05:37:42.700
tend to be small and don't always follow any general rule. This doesn't mean the launch of

05:37:42.700 --> 05:37:47.900
the two systems was uneventful, but even here, events of note had nothing to do with the systems.

05:37:48.940 --> 05:37:54.300
A global pandemic, combined with a global microchip shortage, led to supply issues and stock

05:37:54.300 --> 05:38:00.300
shortages for both companies, which then led to heavy scalping. For what it's worth,

05:38:00.300 --> 05:38:05.260
the PlayStation 5 got scalped harder and would eventually sell more, with recent

05:38:05.260 --> 05:38:13.500
figures putting the PS5 at 30 million units sold to the Xbox's 18.5 million, although even in 2022,

05:38:13.500 --> 05:38:20.060
hardware availability was still a limiting factor. Regardless, even if the console war has turned

05:38:20.060 --> 05:38:24.540
cold, there have still been major developments that will likely shape the future of gaming in

05:38:24.540 --> 05:38:30.700
the years to follow. The first is the emergence of virtual reality headsets, which would see a

05:38:30.700 --> 05:38:36.780
major breakthrough when 18 year old Palmer Lucky had the idea to use cheap lenses in place of older

05:38:36.780 --> 05:38:41.580
expensive lenses and instead tackle the problem of lens distortion through software,

05:38:42.220 --> 05:38:49.020
creating the potential for much lower cost systems. Lucky was joined by John Carmack of Doomfame,

05:38:49.020 --> 05:38:54.860
and together they created the company Oculus VR in 2012, which was then purchased by Facebook

05:38:54.940 --> 05:39:00.060
two years later. Sony and Valve would also start development of their own headsets,

05:39:00.060 --> 05:39:08.220
and in 2016 the Oculus Rift, the Vive from Valve and HTC, and PlayStation VR all launched to the

05:39:08.220 --> 05:39:15.420
public and received a mixed reception. Praise was given to the immersiveness and uniqueness of the

05:39:15.420 --> 05:39:21.580
experience, while criticism focused on the high prices, high latency, the practicality of space

05:39:21.660 --> 05:39:28.060
required, long-term comfort, and the possibility of motion sickness. In time, second generation

05:39:28.060 --> 05:39:33.740
headsets arrived that made significant improvements over their predecessors. The Oculus Quest 1 and 2

05:39:33.740 --> 05:39:39.020
provided standalone headsets that removed the problem of wires. The Valve Index provided

05:39:39.020 --> 05:39:44.140
impressive field of view and resolution while making improvements to comfort, albeit at an

05:39:44.140 --> 05:39:50.140
impressively high price, and recently the PlayStation VR 2 provided a high-end headset

05:39:50.140 --> 05:39:57.020
with an OLED screen and a strong price-to-performance ratio. Seven years after VR headsets first

05:39:57.020 --> 05:40:02.460
arrived, it's become clear that despite their rather lackluster start, VR technology is making

05:40:02.460 --> 05:40:09.340
impressive strides and still getting better every year. That said, truly widespread adoption still

05:40:09.340 --> 05:40:14.620
hasn't happened yet, and the experience provided by VR headsets has so far seemed to be more of an

05:40:14.700 --> 05:40:20.940
adjacent experience to traditional gaming than a replacement. As while VR does allow for completely

05:40:20.940 --> 05:40:26.780
new types of experiences, it also has significant disadvantages, like the limitations of controls

05:40:26.780 --> 05:40:32.860
or long-term comfort that make it a bad fit for some areas of gaming. Still, when it comes to the

05:40:32.860 --> 05:40:38.540
console war, Sony has established themselves as one of the best manufacturers in the VR industry

05:40:38.540 --> 05:40:44.380
and are placing more and more focus on VR games, while Nintendo have mostly stayed away

05:40:44.380 --> 05:40:49.900
and Microsoft has made some big moves in the past but have distanced themselves more recently,

05:40:49.900 --> 05:40:54.700
meaning if VR does become a larger part of the industry, it's Sony who looks like the one who

05:40:54.700 --> 05:41:00.140
benefit the most. And if the rate at which VR technology is improving remains steady,

05:41:00.140 --> 05:41:06.540
it's easy to imagine the VR industry seeing significant growth over the 2020s, as better tech

05:41:06.540 --> 05:41:12.700
leads to more users, which leads to more games, which leads to more users, as the positive feedback

05:41:12.700 --> 05:41:19.420
loop kicks in and VR finally becomes a core part of the industry alongside consoles, PC and mobiles.

05:41:20.940 --> 05:41:26.060
But while Sony might be winning at VR, Microsoft has seen growth in a different area.

05:41:27.420 --> 05:41:32.140
Game streaming has been around since the start of the decade, with companies like OnLive and

05:41:32.140 --> 05:41:37.340
Gaikai offering forms of cloud gaming, a service where you play games on a remote server,

05:41:37.340 --> 05:41:43.500
which is then streamed directly to a user's device. This removes costly hardware requirements,

05:41:43.500 --> 05:41:48.860
but also requires high-speed, low-latency internet connections and substantial data usage.

05:41:50.060 --> 05:41:55.980
Neither OnLive nor Gaikai would turn a profit and both would eventually be acquired by Sony,

05:41:55.980 --> 05:41:59.740
but in time other cloud-based streaming services would appear to take their place.

05:42:00.700 --> 05:42:05.980
Meanwhile, both Sony and Microsoft launched their own game subscription services, PlayStation Now

05:42:05.980 --> 05:42:11.180
and Xbox Game Pass, which would incorporate cloud gaming as well as provide access to a range of

05:42:11.180 --> 05:42:17.580
games that can be played for no additional cost. Of all subscription and streaming-based services,

05:42:17.580 --> 05:42:22.620
Xbox Game Pass has reached the most users, while seeing substantial uptake amongst PC players.

05:42:23.580 --> 05:42:28.140
It seems clear that the plan is to create something like a Netflix for video games,

05:42:28.140 --> 05:42:31.820
however despite heavy investment from Microsoft, they still haven't been able to reach their

05:42:31.820 --> 05:42:37.740
target numbers and are facing a lot of competition from other companies like Amazon and Nvidia.

05:42:39.100 --> 05:42:42.380
The full impact of game subscriptions and streaming remains to be seen.

05:42:43.180 --> 05:42:47.020
Some worry that widespread use of game subscriptions will move games further towards

05:42:47.020 --> 05:42:52.060
additional monetization methods like microtransactions, while widespread use of streaming

05:42:52.060 --> 05:42:57.100
could have an even more substantial impact as it threatens the existence of traditional console

05:42:57.100 --> 05:43:03.100
and PC gaming entirely, particularly in regions where people may already have less disposable income.

05:43:04.380 --> 05:43:08.780
Rumors also currently exist about a cloud gaming handheld device from Sony,

05:43:08.780 --> 05:43:13.340
and it seems possible that cloud gaming will come to play a much greater role in the industry

05:43:13.340 --> 05:43:19.020
in years to come. Game Pass hasn't been Microsoft's only recent investment, however.

05:43:19.740 --> 05:43:23.980
The final trend that seems to be defining the current generation is consolidation.

05:43:23.980 --> 05:43:29.740
When Microsoft announced its acquisition of five smaller studios at E3 2018,

05:43:29.740 --> 05:43:34.940
few questioned the move. Sony had been winning the exclusive war for years and showed no signs

05:43:34.940 --> 05:43:39.740
of stopping, so it made sense that Microsoft would look to acquire talented studios of their own

05:43:39.740 --> 05:43:44.060
to create dedicated first-party titles to help them keep up with the competition.

05:43:45.260 --> 05:43:51.420
Microsoft's acquisitions didn't end at E3 2018, however. First, there were more smaller

05:43:51.420 --> 05:43:55.980
studios announced. Then, there was the more surprising news of a deal to acquire Zenimax in

05:43:55.980 --> 05:44:03.020
2020 for $8.1 billion, which included Bethesda and big-name franchises like The Elder Scrolls and

05:44:03.020 --> 05:44:09.020
Fallout. Then, other large companies seemed to join in with major purchases, like EA acquiring

05:44:09.020 --> 05:44:16.460
Gloomobile for $2.4 billion, Take-Two acquiring Zynga for $12.7 billion, and Sony acquiring Bungie

05:44:16.460 --> 05:44:22.700
for $3.7 billion. Still, the biggest buyer would once again be Microsoft, who announced the deal

05:44:22.700 --> 05:44:30.940
to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2022. Activision Blizzard are the largest

05:44:30.940 --> 05:44:38.700
third-party publisher in gaming, and an acquisition of this size is unprecedented. This is different

05:44:38.700 --> 05:44:43.180
to buying talented studios, which is something large gaming companies have been doing for years.

05:44:43.980 --> 05:44:47.660
Instead, this is basically buying a significant chunk of the industry,

05:44:47.660 --> 05:44:53.020
and many, including regulatory bodies and antitrust agencies, have expressed concern

05:44:53.020 --> 05:44:57.340
about the potential negative impacts this may have, with the deal still currently facing

05:44:57.340 --> 05:45:02.300
significant challenge, particularly from the competition and markets authority in the United

05:45:02.300 --> 05:45:06.940
Kingdom. Whether this deal will ultimately go through, though, remains to be seen.

05:45:08.220 --> 05:45:12.620
Microsoft has been quietly losing the console war for years, and most believe

05:45:12.620 --> 05:45:18.060
competition between major gaming companies can only benefit consumers. Yet, whether these moves

05:45:18.060 --> 05:45:23.900
will make the console market more or less competitive is unclear, and this general trend

05:45:23.900 --> 05:45:30.860
towards consolidation certainly raises concerns. Still, this is hardly the only thing people have

05:45:30.860 --> 05:45:46.380
been critical of in recent years. The Romans had a saying that translates to,

05:45:46.380 --> 05:45:51.580
the past is always well remembered, and the Romans weren't alone in this belief.

05:45:52.940 --> 05:45:58.620
Sometimes, however, things really do get worse. So, what about video games?

05:45:59.580 --> 05:46:04.220
Everywhere you look online, you'll find people telling you about how bad games are now,

05:46:04.220 --> 05:46:10.140
and how much better they were in the past, but the internet is also addicted to negativity,

05:46:10.140 --> 05:46:17.660
and people are biased. So, what evidence is there for this belief, and what does gaming's 50 year

05:46:17.660 --> 05:46:25.820
history actually tell us? Well, for one thing, the future does raise concerns, but a worrying

05:46:25.900 --> 05:46:32.940
future isn't anything new. This is an industry of change, and change brings uncertainty.

05:46:33.740 --> 05:46:39.740
The gaming industry has crashed more than once. The console market almost died completely. The

05:46:39.740 --> 05:46:44.780
biggest gaming company in the world went bankrupt. Many other console manufacturers also exited the

05:46:44.780 --> 05:46:50.460
scene. Reliable companies have produced spectacular failures. Established companies have experienced

05:46:50.540 --> 05:46:56.140
tragic deaths. Y2K didn't happen, but multiple stock market crashes did. The most successful

05:46:56.140 --> 05:47:00.540
console of all time was followed by the company's greatest failure, and soon after this, every other

05:47:00.540 --> 05:47:06.060
major player also suffered their greatest failures. Motion controls threatened to take over, PC gaming

05:47:06.060 --> 05:47:10.780
threatened to become irrelevant, mobile gaming threatened to take over, indie gaming threatened

05:47:10.780 --> 05:47:17.180
to become apocalyptic, online gaming threatened to take over, and now, consolidation, monetization,

05:47:17.260 --> 05:47:23.820
and subscription services threaten gaming as we know it. And time will tell how things play out,

05:47:23.820 --> 05:47:29.260
but really, future concerns are a part of the gaming industry, and they always have been.

05:47:30.620 --> 05:47:36.860
So, what about the present? Well, one of the biggest trends in the last 10 years has been a

05:47:36.860 --> 05:47:44.380
growing abundance of remakes, remasters, reboots, and re-releases. On the one hand,

05:47:44.380 --> 05:47:48.940
old games don't always remain accessible, and so attempts to bring them to modern audiences

05:47:48.940 --> 05:47:54.940
makes sense. And as the passage of time creates more old games, it also makes sense that there

05:47:54.940 --> 05:48:00.460
might be more attempts to bring back older classics. This might also be representative

05:48:00.460 --> 05:48:04.780
of the changing demographics of gamers, where there's now a large portion of older people

05:48:04.780 --> 05:48:10.780
nostalgic for the games from their childhood, or younger gamers unwilling or unable to play older

05:48:10.780 --> 05:48:16.620
games who still want a way to feel included. Still, one thing that is hard to justify is the

05:48:16.620 --> 05:48:22.540
low quality of some of these newer additions. There are many remasters and remakes that could

05:48:22.540 --> 05:48:28.700
be criticized, but perhaps the single one most endemic of a bigger problem is Grand Theft Auto,

05:48:28.700 --> 05:48:34.300
The Trilogy, The Definitive Edition, a compilation of three of the best-selling games of the 2000s

05:48:34.300 --> 05:48:39.820
that was published by one of the most respected developers in gaming, and yet, the end result

05:48:39.900 --> 05:48:46.060
was appalling, being buggy, inauthentic, and an all-round visual downgrade, with missing

05:48:46.060 --> 05:48:52.220
animations, sound effects, and textures. The Definitive Edition received one of the lowest

05:48:52.220 --> 05:48:58.540
user scores of all time, and stands as a testament to just how bad an improved addition can be,

05:48:58.540 --> 05:49:03.900
with Rockstar making matters even worse by also removing the original games from stores at the

05:49:03.900 --> 05:49:11.340
same time. So, various re-releases have given companies a lazy and low-cost way to cash in on

05:49:11.340 --> 05:49:17.980
past games. Some remakes do receive considerably more effort, but even these display a deep lack

05:49:17.980 --> 05:49:23.260
of originality as companies are choosing to finance remakes of still readily accessible

05:49:23.260 --> 05:49:29.260
and enjoyable games in place of creating something new, and this practice seems to be becoming more

05:49:29.260 --> 05:49:38.540
common. So far in 2023, 90% of the highest-rated games are remasters and remakes. This is rather

05:49:38.540 --> 05:49:44.300
pathetic, but the high critical ratings and the fact these games continue to sell is proof that

05:49:44.300 --> 05:49:51.420
this is what many people want. One day, attitudes might change, but for now gaming companies just

05:49:51.420 --> 05:49:56.460
seem to be giving the people what they ask for, with the quality varying between attempts.

05:49:57.180 --> 05:50:03.100
Another trend of modern gaming has been additional monetization methods, such as loot boxes and in-game

05:50:03.100 --> 05:50:09.580
cash stores. For the mobile industry and many online games, these have been incredibly effective at

05:50:09.580 --> 05:50:15.420
increasing revenue, and this has come to extend to even some more traditional games, although some

05:50:15.420 --> 05:50:21.340
attempts have been met with considerable backlash. Still, much like with remasters and remakes,

05:50:21.420 --> 05:50:26.140
consumers again have a choice here, both in whether to play these games and whether to spend

05:50:26.140 --> 05:50:31.100
money on these services, and again, many people are making the choices that make additional

05:50:31.100 --> 05:50:37.820
monetization methods profitable. The gaming industry is a business, and if consumers allow it,

05:50:37.820 --> 05:50:45.180
companies will do what makes them the most money. Finally, another obvious trend has been a decline

05:50:45.180 --> 05:50:50.300
in the quality of AAA, with games seeming to take longer to release while taking less

05:50:51.260 --> 05:50:55.660
risks in their design and being more likely to launch unfinished and buggy.

05:50:56.860 --> 05:51:01.180
This is partly because advancements in game technology have slowed over time,

05:51:01.180 --> 05:51:05.660
alongside ever rising game development costs, which has meant graphical upgrades have become

05:51:05.660 --> 05:51:10.780
less noticeable, and impressing gamers through continually creating more spectacular games

05:51:10.780 --> 05:51:17.820
has become harder. As a result, games might be overambitious, or make sacrifices to gameplay

05:51:17.820 --> 05:51:24.060
or design, or take longer to release, or make sacrifices to quality in order to meet deadlines.

05:51:25.180 --> 05:51:29.820
Claiming that AAA games have got worse in recent years seems pretty reasonable though.

05:51:30.700 --> 05:51:34.700
The thing is, many of the highest-rated and best-selling games from recent years

05:51:34.700 --> 05:51:40.700
have still been the biggest budget and most visually impressive titles. Critics and consumers

05:51:40.700 --> 05:51:46.460
are like, want and reward AAA game design, and amongst these games there will be some that

05:51:46.460 --> 05:51:53.100
succeed, and some that fall short. It seems unrealistic to expect every game to meet the

05:51:53.100 --> 05:51:58.620
highest standards, or to criticise the industry for caring too much about budgets and presentation,

05:51:58.620 --> 05:52:01.980
while people continue to praise those same qualities in other games.

05:52:03.740 --> 05:52:09.100
A lot of the problems mentioned here do have some relation to greed, and the gaming industry,

05:52:09.100 --> 05:52:15.740
like other industries, can certainly be greedy. This also isn't anything new however.

05:52:16.540 --> 05:52:21.180
After the success of Pong, gaming companies made so many Pong clones, the industry collapsed.

05:52:21.900 --> 05:52:26.620
After the success of Atari, game developers made so many low-quality third-party games

05:52:26.620 --> 05:52:32.140
that the industry collapsed again. Space Invaders led to too many arcade space games,

05:52:32.140 --> 05:52:37.020
NES developers made too many action platformers, Doom led to too many Doom clones,

05:52:37.020 --> 05:52:42.380
Grand Theft Auto led to too many GTA clones, Guitar Hero led to too many plastic peripherals,

05:52:42.460 --> 05:52:47.660
The Wii led to too many motion control devices, and too many low-effort motion control games.

05:52:47.660 --> 05:52:52.620
Call of Duty led to too many Call of Duties, Minecraft led to too many Minecraft clones,

05:52:52.620 --> 05:52:57.980
Dark Souls led to too many Souls Likes, Skyrim and Far Cry 3 led to too many Open World games,

05:52:57.980 --> 05:53:02.540
Daisy led to too many Early Access Survival games, PUBG and Fortnite led to too many Battle

05:53:02.540 --> 05:53:07.500
Real games, Indie games led to too many Indie games, Slay the Spire led to too many Rogue-like

05:53:07.500 --> 05:53:13.180
deckbuilders and most recently, Vampire Survivors led to too many whatever the hell genre this is.

05:53:14.300 --> 05:53:20.540
The point is, success often leads to saturation, and it's been that way since the very start.

05:53:21.500 --> 05:53:26.860
And yet, at the same time, the industry has often rewarded those who go against the grain.

05:53:27.660 --> 05:53:34.380
Pac-Man, Tetris, Pokemon Red and Blue, Half-Life, The Sims, The DS, The Wii, Minecraft,

05:53:34.460 --> 05:53:41.100
Dark Souls, Daisy, Battle Real, Gaming History is littered with games that did something different

05:53:41.100 --> 05:53:46.940
and were rewarded for doing so. The point that I think everything comes down to in the end

05:53:47.740 --> 05:53:53.500
is choice. People do have a choice in who they support and how they spend their time,

05:53:54.140 --> 05:53:59.740
and sometimes the choices of gaming companies or the general public can be frustrating,

05:54:00.540 --> 05:54:04.140
but it is their choice to make and they do have their reasons.

05:54:05.500 --> 05:54:11.820
And after months of researching, thinking and writing about gaming history, I have come to the

05:54:11.820 --> 05:54:20.700
conclusion that nothing defines this present moment in time as much as choice does. It is a

05:54:20.700 --> 05:54:25.740
strange thing to try to write the history of the present, because so much of how we understand

05:54:25.740 --> 05:54:31.900
the period is shaped by how it looks from the future. That said, I don't think there is a crisis

05:54:31.900 --> 05:54:37.900
of modern gaming. I don't think the industry is in decline, and I don't think games are getting

05:54:37.900 --> 05:54:44.780
worse. And the reason is because currently, right now, we all have an abundance of choice.

05:54:45.980 --> 05:54:51.820
The industry has grown wider and become more accessible, but this is the result of growth,

05:54:52.540 --> 05:54:55.900
and traditional gaming hasn't been sacrificed to achieve this.

05:54:57.340 --> 05:55:00.940
Instead, within traditional gaming, we've seen a tremendous increase

05:55:00.940 --> 05:55:05.980
in the number and types of indie games being made, while through emulation,

05:55:05.980 --> 05:55:11.980
re-releases, community efforts, second-hand purchases, and official subscription services,

05:55:11.980 --> 05:55:17.660
older games have never been more available, and with the likes of cloud gaming and indie games,

05:55:17.660 --> 05:55:23.820
the barrier of entry into gaming has never been so low. The number of games being made

05:55:23.820 --> 05:55:31.500
has also increased, and for most people, older games are still out there. Everyone today has

05:55:31.500 --> 05:55:38.540
a great amount of choice, and that makes us rather lucky. I hope this abundance of choice

05:55:38.540 --> 05:55:45.660
remains in the future. In fact, I hope we get even more choice in the years to come, but this isn't

05:55:45.660 --> 05:55:53.900
guaranteed. One day, all old cartridges will stop working, CDs will rot, and old hardware

05:55:53.900 --> 05:56:00.380
will fail. One day, computers may struggle to be compatible with older software. One day,

05:56:00.380 --> 05:56:06.940
emulation might be shut down or strictly regulated. One day, fees may increase. One day,

05:56:06.940 --> 05:56:12.220
competition may disappear. One day, the indie market may collapse. One day, the console market

05:56:12.220 --> 05:56:18.940
may collapse. One day, the entire industry may collapse. It certainly has before. The future

05:56:18.940 --> 05:56:26.140
holds no guarantees, and this is an industry of change. But right now, things aren't as bad as

05:56:26.140 --> 05:56:32.620
many people might think they are. Good games are being made every single year, and goddamn,

05:56:32.620 --> 05:56:39.100
is there a lot of good games already out there. Video games have come a long way,

05:56:39.660 --> 05:56:47.420
and not every change has been for the better. But never before have people had so much choice.

05:56:49.020 --> 05:56:49.980
Use it wisely.

05:56:55.820 --> 05:57:08.940
This has been the entire history of video games. Thank you for watching.

05:57:09.500 --> 05:57:19.580
I promised myself I'd do a Patreon plug here, so here it is. The video is over. I hope you enjoyed

05:57:19.580 --> 05:57:26.940
it. It took a long time to make, but I think it was worth it. I've been making videos for five

05:57:26.940 --> 05:57:32.620
years now. In fact, this will probably be up almost exactly on the channel's five-year anniversary.

05:57:33.340 --> 05:57:39.020
And I am lucky to be in the position I'm in. But the channel growth has slowed a lot recently,

05:57:39.500 --> 05:57:43.500
and I'm feeling under a lot of pressure to try to satisfy the algorithm.

05:57:44.220 --> 05:57:49.980
And that's how YouTube goes. But I do feel very limited in what videos I can make.

05:57:50.700 --> 05:57:55.740
I'd love to make more time-consuming and unique videos, like deep dives into certain areas of

05:57:55.740 --> 05:58:01.740
the gaming industry. But it is a consistent worry for me how such videos will perform,

05:58:01.740 --> 05:58:06.540
and whether I can afford to spend hundreds of hours on projects, knowing that a bad

05:58:06.540 --> 05:58:10.860
Titan or thumbnail could doom the video for a bad click-through rate and so on.

05:58:12.300 --> 05:58:17.260
For this reason, I'm thinking of trying to promote the Patreon more to try to get myself

05:58:17.260 --> 05:58:23.100
a little more creative freedom. I've hardly mentioned the Patreon for the past year or so,

05:58:23.100 --> 05:58:27.820
but I'm going to start promoting it a bit more often, like at the end of videos,

05:58:27.820 --> 05:58:33.500
as I'm doing now. That's what this is. This is promotion. I don't have much to offer for

05:58:33.500 --> 05:58:39.740
patrons, but I've revamped the tiers a bit. For $6 you get your name in the credits for videos,

05:58:39.740 --> 05:58:45.180
but you can give less for that as well, and all patrons get all other benefits,

05:58:45.180 --> 05:58:52.140
which include detailed monthly updates, the occasional Patreon poll, and access to some

05:58:52.140 --> 05:58:57.820
unlisted videos which includes a few uncensored videos, a few older videos not on the channel

05:58:57.820 --> 05:59:07.500
anymore, and a few unique reviews. Other than that, all I can say is I work many hours on these videos,

05:59:07.500 --> 05:59:13.180
I work long hours, I rarely take breaks, I try my best to maintain a high level of quality,

05:59:13.180 --> 05:59:19.740
and I do everything on my own. And you don't need to give anything, but it would mean a lot to me

05:59:19.740 --> 05:59:29.740
if you did. Anyway, thank you for watching regardless, and I'll see you in the next video.
