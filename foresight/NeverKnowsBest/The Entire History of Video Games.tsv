0	6000	Video games have come a long way. From once being seen as a temporary fad, to
6000	11760	just toys for children, or immoral corruptors of the youth, today the gaming
11760	16800	industry easily surpasses the film and music industries combined and it's
16800	22160	still growing. Still, as tempting as it might be to draw comparisons to more
22160	26320	established industries, the reality is that video games have proved to be
26320	32040	something unique. No other industry has been so closely tied to technological
32040	38560	progress. No industry has ever grown so far so fast and no other industry has
38560	44000	experienced so much change in such a short time. With multi-billion dollar
44000	48520	companies rising and falling in the space for a few years and the entire gaming
48520	53520	landscape being radically changed more than once by a couple guys working out
53520	61040	of a garage. And all this in something that's only been around about 50 years.
61040	68480	Video games have come a long way and their evolution has been remarkable. Today
68480	72360	though, more and more people seem to be viewing the industry with pessimism and
72360	77720	despite continued growth, its future doesn't look quite as bright as it once
77720	82920	did, with companies and consumers alike increasingly seeming to be looking to the
82920	91240	past. So, let's talk about the past. All of it, from the very first game right up
91240	98120	to where we are today and every major event in between. This is the entire
98120	102640	history of video games and it begins with something that would end up as a bit of a
102640	107360	staple for the industry. War.
107360	118000	World War II was kind of a big deal. In addition to deciding the fate of a
118000	122520	global population and shaping the modern world as we know it, it also saw
122520	126440	rapid technological advancement that would pave the way for something equally
126440	132800	important. Video games. After building the first ever digital computers for the
132800	137240	purpose of numerical processing and code-breaking as part of the war effort,
137240	141360	this technology was subsequently commercialized and found its way to
141360	148600	several universities. And where computers go, video games soon follow. Of course,
148600	153320	they weren't exactly designed as video games so much as demonstrations to show
153320	157520	what computers could do or just experiments to further the field of
157520	162920	computer science. The first to be shown to the public was Bertie the Brain in
162920	170560	1950, who played Tic Tac Toe. Poor Bertie was apparently quite good, although
170560	174640	every photo seems to show him losing and he was dismantled two weeks after the
174640	180720	exhibition, as tended to be the case with these early computers. The first game to
180720	187200	be created as entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, a side-on simulation of
187200	191920	a game of tennis that ran on an analog computer and was created by William
191920	196320	Higginbotham, a man perhaps better known for his role in the creation of the
196320	204600	atomic bomb. Meanwhile in 1962, Space War, a two player 1v1 space battle
204600	210320	simulation created at MIT, became the first game to see wider distribution as
210320	216400	its source code was shared between students and institutions. As the 60s
216440	220640	continued, more games were created for the mainframe and mini computers of the
220640	225600	era, but their popularity was quite limited by the fact that the computers
225600	230760	needed to run these games cost thousands and thousands of dollars, something
230760	236560	affordable for a university but less so for the average family. Things would
236560	241080	change in the 1970s however as video games started to appear alongside
241160	248120	Pimble Machines and other mechanical games in arcades. The first arcade video
248120	254480	game was Computer Space in 1971 which took heavy inspiration from the earlier
254480	260840	Space War and was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Damby. Computer Space
260840	265200	saw limited success but its creators still believed in the potential of the
265200	272680	medium so they founded their own company, Atari. At the same time as this, new
272680	278360	breakthroughs were happening elsewhere as in 1972 the first ever home console was
278360	285400	released by electronics company Magnavox. It was called the Odyssey and its
285400	290480	development started six years earlier with the version finally released being
290480	295480	the seventh successive prototype. The main challenge for team faced was
295480	301400	affordability. The technology for a home console existed, it was just a question
301400	305320	of how to keep the price low enough that anyone would be willing to manufacture
305320	312520	or buy it. But eventually the team led by Ralph Bear found a way and so video
312520	318640	games at long last came to the American family home. This was an important
318640	323080	milestone although the Odyssey didn't exactly see the runaway success of later
323080	328920	consoles. Still its simple two-player table tennis game did provide the
328920	334400	inspiration for Atari's first game, a remarkably similar looking future
334400	342520	phenomenon Pong. Released in arcades in late 1972 Pong was a game that changed
342520	348920	gaming proving immensely popular in arcades and at 25 cent a game also
348920	357160	immensely profitable. By the end of 72 we did three and a half million dollars and
357160	364440	then we did 19 million then we did 35 million hockey stick. In fact Pong was
364440	370120	so popular that the first machine installed quickly stopped working. Atari
370120	373360	were called out to get it going again and found the problem was that the
373360	378000	cash box had overflowed from the vast amount of quarters leading the machine
378000	385920	to become jammed. And so arcades exploded in popularity as Pong proved gaming's
385920	392600	potential. Video games had arrived and at the birth of this exciting new medium
392600	399240	where the possibilities are endless how did everyone react you might wonder.
399480	406920	Well obviously they copied the one thing everyone knew already worked. Atari
406920	412280	made sequels and successors as well as their own dedicated home Pong console
412280	417040	and other companies made their own versions alongside their own sequels
417040	424000	and successors and dedicated home systems. Pong was everywhere as profit led
424000	430960	to proliferation and before long video games were in decline. By the mid 1970s
430960	436360	arcade growth slowed and then shrunk as the market became saturated with Pong
436360	440080	clones and brand new companies that had once rushed to cash in on this big new
440080	445760	thing started going under. Atari themselves fared better although they
445760	450280	had their own troubles by way of a lawsuit that came from Magna Box over
450280	456120	the striking similarities between Pong and their table tennis game. Atari
456120	460760	settled but they weren't the only ones being sued and Magna Box's winnings
460760	466840	ended up totaling over 100 million dollars. And so arcades were struggling
466840	472040	but thanks to technological advancements over the 70s a new prize was up for
472040	477240	grabs and the competition would be intense.
481280	486440	Arcades might have been where video games got their start but home consoles
486440	493200	offered an even greater opportunity and people were quick to realize it. In 1975
493200	497440	the year Atari's home Pong released there were seven other companies
497440	504640	releasing home video game consoles of their own. By 1977 there were at least
505000	511880	82 other companies with 160 different models being released in that year alone.
511880	517760	The consoles from this era were dedicated systems meaning they could only play
517760	523200	one or more built-in games that came included. A lot of these were simply
523200	527720	Pong clones with Atari even taking measures to make the cloning process
527720	533760	more difficult to hinder their rivals. We actually became quite diabolical about
533760	539920	seeing ways that we could just mess them up. We put a chip in and we purposefully
539920	546400	mismarked it so that when somebody copied us they put the wrong chip in. This
546400	550520	didn't stop the market from becoming saturated however but this time a
550520	556400	solution would come through innovation and once more it would be Atari who led
556400	557760	the way.
563760	570760	The Atari video computer system is 20 cartridges with 1300 game variations you
570760	572760	play on your own TV set.
576760	584960	The Atari video computer system later called the Atari 2600 released in 1977.
584960	590000	One year after the Fairchild Channel F became the first ever console to feature
590000	595520	interchangeable cartridges. Bushnell saw the advantages cartridges provided and
595520	600760	rushed to reduce a cartridge based system of his own but earlier problems with
600760	606400	lawsuits, increasing competition and decline in arcade sales meant Atari's
606400	611600	funds were getting low and so they made a deal with Warner Communications to sell
611600	617200	Atari for $28 million. The consequences of this deal would be seen most clearly
617200	621720	in the following years but for now it meant Atari had the money to finish
621720	626400	their new console to beat out their main rival Magnavox who had released their
626400	635560	own cartridge based system the Odyssey 2 in 1978. The Atari 2600 would be huge
635560	641040	with lifetime sales of over 30 million units a number that dwarfs any other
641040	648800	console of the era. Still this success came slowly and in late 1977 the entire
648800	656560	gaming industry experienced its first but by no means last crash. The combination
656560	661400	of a saturated market full of dedicated systems alongside new cartridge based
661400	666440	systems that proved far more desirable meant heaps of dedicated systems
666440	670720	suddenly stopped selling leaving retailers with a surplus of stock they
670720	674280	couldn't shift and causing game developers to cancel most dedicated
674280	678920	systems that were currently in development. The resulting downturn hit the
678920	683840	gaming industry hard leading economists and media figures to speculate whether
683840	688320	the entire gaming industry had simply been a short-lived craze that was now
688320	695040	coming to the end of its life cycle. Amidst this pessimism the Atari 2600
695040	701480	with its relatively high price point of $200 which is almost 1000 after
701480	707080	adjusting for inflation was seen as a tough sell and retailers and consumers
707080	711640	alike were hesitant to embrace it meaning Atari was only able to sell a
711640	717320	fraction of the systems they manufactured in its first few years. Further
717320	721680	competition would also come from other cartridge based systems including the
721720	728400	Intellivision from Mattel and the ColecoVision from Coleco but Atari would
728400	732600	soon find the killer app they needed that would not only get themselves back
732600	739520	in business but would also get the entire gaming industry back on track.
743640	750720	Space Invaders was created by Japanese developer Tomohiro Nishikado at Taito
750760	757400	in 1978 and it is easily one of the most important and influential games ever made.
757400	763280	Before Space Invaders different regions like America, Europe and Japan had
763280	768000	little crossover between them but Space Invaders quickly moved beyond regional
768000	773920	borders to become the first truly global gaming mega hit and that was by no
773920	780400	means its only achievement. Its gameplay may look relatively simple today but
780440	785600	in the 70s it was anything but. As a fixed shooter where the player takes on
785600	789880	rows of gradually descending aliens while hiding behind fully destructible
789880	793640	bunkers it was the first game to have enemies that shoot back at the player.
793640	799720	It helped pioneer the move away from timers over to lives-based systems. It
799720	803200	was the first game to feature a high score system giving it potentially
803200	807320	infinite replayability and it was the first game to feature continuous
807320	812560	background music. The background track itself was dynamic and increased in
812560	817120	tempo in time with the enemies increased movement speed as rounds progressed
817120	823400	giving the action a real sense of tension as the difficulty ramped up. This
823400	828960	iconic part of the game wasn't actually intentional. During its development
828960	833280	Nishikado found that the arcade processor struggled to handle so many
833280	838240	enemies on screen at once and yet as the player took out more and more of them
838240	845120	the render speed increased causing the aliens to move faster and faster. This
845120	849560	created a difficulty curve where the challenge rose and fell within each level
849560	854920	to create moments of higher and lower intensity a principle still seen in
854920	861360	game design to this day. Space Invaders also featured some semblance of a story.
861560	870520	Aliens were invading from space and you had to stop them. Okay it's not much but
870520	875120	compared to the more abstract Pong or Breakout it made the action feel much
875120	879160	more contextually meaningful and marked the beginning of arcade games paying
879160	885840	more attention to these kinds of aspects. And if all that wasn't enough there
885840	893280	was also the game's sales. By 1982 Space Invaders had grossed 3.8 billion
893280	899760	dollars which is over 13 billion after inflation meaning it was the then best
899760	906520	selling video game and highest grossing entertainment product of all time. For
906520	911880	the industry this meant video games were back and soon it wasn't just Space
911920	917840	Invaders. 1978 marked the beginning of what has since been named the golden age
917840	924960	of the arcade. 1979 saw the release of Asteroids from Atari which continued the
924960	929920	space battle theme this time in an asteroid field with more complex physics
929920	934560	based movement while also using cutting-edge vector graphics that utilized
934560	940080	lines instead of pixels to provide a crisp display unlike anything that could
940080	945640	be produced on a home TV screen. The trend of popular arcade games where you
945640	951320	shoot things continued in 1980 with Atari's 3D first-person tank sim
951320	956920	battle zone as well as their trackball controlled missile command which took
956920	961120	inspiration from the still ongoing Cold War to task players with defending
961120	967760	cities from intercontinental ballistic missiles. 1981 gave the world defender
967760	971920	from Williams Electronics which pioneered the side-scrolling shoot-em-up
971920	977840	genre and Gallagher from Namco a fixed shooter which featured complex enemy
977840	984080	patterns and power-ups both features that would define the genre moving forward.
984080	990200	Shooters weren't the only thing coming out of arcades though. In 1980 Namco's
990200	997560	Pac-Man gave the world its first gaming mascot Pac-Man well establishing the
997560	1003200	maze chased genre and being the first game to feature power-ups. As iconic as
1003200	1007400	he would go on to become however Pac-Man's path to success wasn't a
1007400	1012760	simple one. The game initially struggled to beat Namco's 1979 space shooter
1012760	1018080	Galaxian in Japan while in America publisher Midway was hesitant to
1018080	1023640	manufacture many units as they were unsure how it would perform. The reason for
1023640	1028600	this was that it didn't involve any shooting and so executives feared it
1028600	1033760	would be less popular with arcades mostly male player base. This was something
1033760	1038800	developer Toru Iwatani had also considered as he deliberately tried to
1038800	1043520	create a game that would appeal to women as well as men and offer something
1043520	1049200	different to war or sports hence the colorful design cute characters and
1049240	1056120	emphasis on eating rather than killing. Iwatani figured that girls like eating
1056120	1061960	things more than killing them and it seems he was on to something because in
1061960	1067160	the end players couldn't get enough of Pac-Man's addictive pellet eating action.
1067160	1071480	Within a year it had become the best-selling arcade game in both Japan
1071480	1080440	and America outgrossing even the 1977 film Star Wars in revenue. Pac-Man was
1080440	1085200	one of the first but by no means last times a video game found record
1085200	1091640	success through broader appeal and targeting new audiences. Its use of
1091640	1096040	vibrant color and its focus on a central titular character would also go on to
1096040	1100240	become video game staples and would soon be seen in other popular arcade
1100240	1109400	titles like Konami's 1981 Road and River Crossing hit Frogger. By 1982 color and
1109400	1114640	3D technology were being combined in even more impressive ways like in Namco's
1114640	1119960	visually striking racing simulator Pole Position and the arcade Golden Age was
1119960	1125040	in full swing with profits from games reaching new heights and Taito, Atari
1125080	1131880	and Namco establishing themselves as the three biggest developers around. Arcades
1131880	1136360	were more than just a place to play games however. Through features like high
1136360	1140600	scores, multiplayer and the ability to watch and compete in front of other
1140600	1146440	people arcades provided a social aspect to gaming that went beyond just playing.
1146440	1152080	Much like how Twitch allows people to watch, discuss and compete in various
1152120	1157200	games today arcades were the live streaming and esports of the 20th
1157200	1161440	century and they offered better gaming experiences than you could get in your
1161440	1166840	home with higher quality graphics, better sound and unique immersive elements
1166840	1172040	like wheels and pedals in racing game cabinets. Arcades would also have a
1172040	1177160	significant impact on future game design. Their quarter hungry monetization
1177160	1181680	method has sometimes led to criticism over their high difficulty with older
1181680	1185480	console games also sometimes coming under fire for inheriting that high
1185480	1190680	difficulty but popular arcade titles knew that if difficulty was the only
1190680	1194560	thing they had to offer players wouldn't have any reason to keep coming back
1194560	1199640	and so they learned how to make skill-based challenges fun and make
1199640	1205840	players want to improve and keep playing. Still as important as arcades were
1205840	1210040	Space Invaders legacy goes beyond just kicking off the Golden Age of arcades
1210320	1214960	and breaking sales records because it also turned things around for the home
1214960	1223360	video game market and Atari. In 1980 Space Invaders came to the 2600 allowing
1223360	1229480	people to play the arcade classic from the comfort of their home. This was the
1229480	1233680	first arcade to home console port and it wouldn't be the last.
1240040	1269040	Space Invaders for the 2600 became the first ever killer app or system
1269040	1275280	seller in video game history and it certainly sold systems with Atari's
1275280	1280800	consumer sales almost doubling to $200 million in the year it released before
1280800	1288000	skyrocketing to over 800 million in 1981 with Atari taking 65% of the global
1288000	1294040	market share and so the great console battle royale that had defined so much
1294040	1300760	of the 70s was over and Atari was the runaway winner. A victory that proved to
1300760	1304520	be surprisingly short-lived.
1308520	1316760	In 1982 Atari was the fastest growing company in American history yet by the
1316760	1322680	end of 1983 they were one of the fastest falling with yearly losses of over
1322680	1327960	$500 million amidst the slide in parent company Warner's stock of almost 70%.
1327960	1335560	In 1984 Atari was sold with Warner receiving no cash for the sale and
1335560	1345600	never again would Atari be a leader in the video game industry. So what happened?
1345600	1352520	Well there is an obvious answer but that only tells part of the story. To really
1352520	1358640	understand we need to rewind a bit and look at where Atari came from. When Nolan
1358640	1363000	Bushnell and Ted Danby decided to start a video game company together they both
1363000	1370360	pitched in $250 of their own money to get the company off the ground. By 1982
1370360	1377920	Atari had 10,000 employees and were bringing in $1.7 billion in operating
1377920	1384640	profit and this all happened in the space of around 10 years. Atari had a
1384640	1389960	colorful history and some important people once worked there including Steve
1389960	1395240	Jobs and Steve Wozniak who left after a few years to start their own company by
1395240	1401040	the name of Apple as well as a young programmer by the name of Bill Gates who
1401040	1406600	was fired for not doing enough work. Atari also had a bit of a reputation for
1406600	1412960	their relaxed office culture. You know flexible hours, informal dress code, the
1412960	1419080	usual sort of thing. As we had a lot of young people we would constantly offer to
1419080	1424320	throw a party if they hit quota and it turns out when you've got 18, 19, 20
1424320	1428080	year olds they're much more interested in the party than an extra you know 50
1428080	1433840	cents an hour. So we got known as a party company. There's a story that if you
1433840	1440680	walked by the Borega Street building and you breathed deeply by the air vents
1440680	1445120	you'd get stoned because the pot smoking inside of it was so heavy. This made
1445120	1450840	them a popular place to work but it didn't last. The gaming industry was at
1450840	1456960	the cutting edge of technology which meant to compete and to win funding was
1456960	1463100	necessary. Hence the move to become a subsidiary of Warner in 1976 which
1463100	1470240	brought in a 120 million dollar cash injection and made the 2600's 1977
1470240	1475740	release possible. Warner communications were a big business however meaning
1475740	1481340	they took a keen interest in how their new subsidiary was being run. To this end
1481340	1487180	Warner brought in an experienced business exec Ray Kassar in 1978 to help
1487180	1493140	with marketing and commercialization but as the influence of Warner grew so too
1493140	1497500	did conflict with then CEO Nolan Bushnell particularly over Bushnell's
1497500	1501340	desire to continue to invest in research and development for new
1501340	1506740	technologically superior consoles. This ultimately led to Bushnell's departure
1506740	1512740	in late 1978. He would go on to found American restaurant chain Chuck E Cheese
1512780	1518380	and Atari went on to soaring new heights now with a more professional work
1518380	1524500	culture under the oversight of Kassar. Conflict wouldn't end here however.
1524500	1530620	Atari was succeeding but they were also changing and not everyone was happy with
1530620	1536820	their new direction. In 1979 four experienced Atari programmers David
1536820	1542100	Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead resigned over Atari's policy
1542100	1547780	to not credit or provide royalties to the actual game developers. These
1547780	1551780	engineers would create a software program that would result in twenty thirty
1551780	1556060	million dollars in sales and they were making this a little paltry salary and
1556060	1561060	they figured gee I'd like to get a penny or two or three per each cartridge. So we
1561060	1564900	go to the president of Atari and point that out and he said to us and I'll
1564900	1570260	quote he said you are no more important to that game than the person on the
1570260	1574700	assembly line who puts it together. So they figured if they weren't going to
1574700	1580180	get credit for their work why do that work for someone else which led them to
1580180	1586220	form their own company. Activision the first ever third-party developer who
1586220	1592020	made sure to emphasize the role of game creators on their products. Atari
1592020	1596220	responded like the true corporate powerhouse they were at this time and
1596260	1600700	sued Activision but they weren't successful at preventing them from
1600700	1605020	producing games for Atari consoles and instead a deal was agreed where the
1605020	1609620	third-party company would pay a portion of their sales as a license fee to the
1609620	1615580	console owner a system that's existed ever since. Activision were only the
1615580	1620100	start of Atari's problems though. Other senior developers would also jump ship
1620100	1625940	but it was in early 1982 that marked the beginning of the end when Atari
1626180	1631220	tried to repeat the earlier magic of their space invaders and asteroids arcade
1631220	1639140	ports with Pac-Man for the 2600. The problem was Pac-Man was no space
1639140	1646940	invaders or asteroids. Released originally in 1980 it ran on 1980s arcade
1646940	1652820	technology with vibrant color smooth animations and high quality sound. All
1652900	1658940	things for now dated 2600 struggled with. The result is a port that will forever
1658940	1665300	live in infamy as one of the worst of all time a Pac-Man in name and not much
1665300	1671380	else. Still Atari's disappointments that year were only just getting started.
1671380	1677780	November saw the release of the 5200 Atari's next generation home system
1678020	1684380	which kicked off the 16-bit era. Unfortunately despite being early to the
1684380	1690300	market there wasn't much else the 5200 had going for it. Its initial price
1690300	1695460	point of $270 was high, it didn't originally come with backwards
1695460	1700900	compatibility, there were few new titles released for it and the controller was
1700900	1706180	widely criticized and while its graphics and hardware were a step up from the
1706500	1712060	2600 and other 8-bit systems the upgrade they provided was small and poorly
1712060	1716620	shown by the few titles the 5200 had available which tended to just be
1716620	1722940	ports of 2600 games. Nolan Bushnell is reported to have left Atari over
1722940	1726620	disagreements with the direction of future console technology and the
1726620	1733660	commercial failure of the Atari 5200 seemed to vindicate his stance. Finally
1733660	1740780	to top Atari's year off there was E.T. which released just in time for the holiday season.
1763660	1780220	E.T. has regularly been called the worst video game of all time. This may be
1780220	1786540	rather harsh but history is rarely known for its kindness. Still worst of all time
1786540	1791860	or not E.T. is certainly symbolic and it's a perfect example of a hubris that
1791860	1798020	brought Atari's downfall. Atari had acquired a license at high cost for an
1798020	1802220	E.T. game following the success of the movie but they wanted the game released
1802220	1807820	in time for Christmas to take advantage of increased holiday sales. This meant a
1807820	1812380	development time of only a few months and so they brought in experienced
1812380	1817420	developer Howard Scott Warshaw who had just completed the ambitious and
1817460	1823980	critically acclaimed Yars Revenge. Warshaw embraced a short development time as a unique
1823980	1830500	challenge and tried to do the miraculous. He failed and the result is a confusing
1830500	1834100	adventure game that had little connection to the original movie beyond its
1834100	1839860	strangely shaped protagonist. This didn't faze Atari however who skipped
1839860	1844820	audience testing to save time and produced an optimistic five million copies
1845180	1854300	for retailers only a fraction of which ended up selling. E.T. was a bad game but in this way it
1854300	1859700	wasn't unique. In fact after the success of Activision more and more developers
1859700	1864900	entered the third party space. This was before game developers needed a license
1864900	1869860	to publish games on consoles which created a free-for-all where quality was a
1869860	1874020	much smaller concern than profit and where accusations of industrial
1874060	1879940	espionage and reverse engineering became rampant due to third party developers lack
1879940	1885540	of familiarity with the hardware of the system they were designing games for. By
1885540	1890700	the start of 1983 at least 100 different companies were developing games for the
1890700	1897900	2600 in a rush to cash in on the now booming video game craze. In the process
1897900	1903100	quality control was often ignored and in this period consumers had few ways to
1903140	1909900	differentiate between good and bad games before it was already too late. As the
1909900	1913740	market continued to become increasingly saturated with low quality games
1913740	1918740	retailers were forced to discount stock to try to get rid of these games
1918740	1924420	encouraging consumers to continue purchasing the now discounted bad games
1924420	1929860	leading to a loss of consumer confidence which even video game Titan Atari
1930100	1936580	wasn't exempt from. In fact Atari likely deserved more of the blame than anyone.
1937700	1944740	Pac-Man for the 2600 was a bad game but it was also the best selling video game
1944740	1950260	of all time and even then Atari still produced far more copies than they
1950260	1957300	ultimately sold. And so with a saturated market little quality control rapidly
1957420	1961660	depleting consumer confidence and even more emergent competition from the
1961660	1967180	home computer market the gaming industry did the inevitable and sunk
1967180	1972660	spectacularly in the great gaming crash of 1983.
1972660	1977580	Video game sales have gone tilt the boom simply isn't booming anymore.
1977580	1982980	If Pac-Man, ET and Raiders of the Lost Ark aren't selling what will.
1983260	1989420	To understand the scale of this disaster it helps to look at the numbers. In 1983
1989420	1997900	home video game revenues peaked at 3.2 billion dollars. By 1985 this number
1997900	2007220	had fallen to 100 million a decrease of almost 97%. Once quarterly earnings
2007220	2011500	started to reveal the degree to which games had stopped selling investors
2011660	2016140	started panicking cashing out their gaming stock and effectively ending the
2016140	2021420	supply of new money that had previously supported the once growing market. As a
2021420	2027260	result many newer gaming companies went bankrupt. Mattel, Coleco and Magnavox
2027260	2032780	all discontinued their gaming lines entirely and Atari was sold for almost
2032780	2037220	nothing with hundreds of thousands of on-soul games being famously dumped
2037220	2043740	and buried in a landfill in New Mexico. Arcades still saw some popularity but
2043740	2047900	they once more entered into a period of decline with the golden age having now
2047900	2055580	come to an abrupt end. And so video games were officially over being once more
2055580	2060100	seen as nothing but a short-lived fad not so different from other popular
2060100	2064780	toy lines that burn bright and then burn out once consumers get bored of them.
2065540	2071060	And this is how they would continue to be seen in America for the next two years
2071060	2083260	until a new name entered the scene. While the American gaming industry crashed
2083260	2089660	and burned in 1983 across the Pacific in gaming's second largest market the year
2089660	2093740	would be remembered for a different reason. The release of the Nintendo
2093740	2100900	family computer also known as the Famicom. It wasn't until 1985 that
2100900	2104540	Nintendo would bring their new console across the Pacific and rescue the
2104540	2109940	American gaming industry but for Nintendo the story starts much earlier.
2109940	2116660	Founded in 1889 Nintendo began life as a playing card manufacturer before
2116660	2122580	diversifying into tabletop games and eventually electronic toys. Their first
2122620	2128940	foray into video games came from making light gun accessories but in 1977 they
2128940	2134140	went a step further with the release of the Color TV game a Japanese only
2134140	2139300	dedicated home console inspired by the success of Magnavox and Atari which
2139300	2148300	contained Pong in six different variants. In Nintendo's defense at least they paid
2148340	2155740	Magnavox for a license unlike most. The Color TV game sold well thanks in part to
2155740	2161140	its modest price and Nintendo went on to reduce several more variants all for
2161140	2165700	their home market of Japan. They also entered the arcade space with a game
2165700	2170980	based on the board game of Fellow. It was during this period but a fresh faced
2170980	2176820	25 year old by the name of Shigeru Miyamoto joined the company but Miyamoto
2176860	2182260	would not be Nintendo's first gaming superstar. That honor belongs to one
2182260	2187100	Gunpei Yokoi head of Nintendo's research and development one division and
2187100	2193900	creator of the iconic handheld game and watch. Apparently inspired by Yokoi
2193900	2198460	watching a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator on a train the
2198460	2203180	game and watch was an early dedicated handheld with an LCD display and fixed
2203220	2210420	animations. It also pioneered the D-pad. In expensive and long running the game
2210420	2214260	and watch's sales blew most early handheld competition out of the water
2214260	2220140	selling more units than even Atari's 2600 over the course of its lifetime but
2220140	2225900	Nintendo was only just getting started. After several less successful arcade
2225900	2233060	attempts the company's next big break came with 1981's Donkey Kong designed by
2233260	2237260	Miyamoto with the oversight of Yokoi it was originally developed as a way to
2237260	2241540	reuse old cabinets of Miyamoto's previous and rather less successful
2241540	2248300	radar scope. Donkey Kong took inspiration from Popeye and featured the titular
2248300	2252660	ape as the game's barrel-throwing antagonist alongside the player controlled
2252660	2257620	jump man who would go on to become one of the most recognizable characters in
2257620	2263940	the world after he was renamed to Mario. Donkey Kong was one of the earliest
2263940	2269020	platformers and the first game to feature jumping. It also broke new ground
2269020	2273700	in narrative design featuring a complete storyline told entirely on screen
2273700	2278300	with Donkey Kong kidnapping Mario's girlfriend who the player then works to
2278300	2284340	rescue before finally watching the two be reunited. It was also a massive hit
2284700	2288540	establishing Nintendo's name internationally and creating a bid and war
2288540	2294860	between console rivals Atari and Coleco over the rights to publish it. Nintendo
2294860	2299580	would follow Donkey Kong with multiple sequels but it was their return to home
2299580	2309220	consoles that would change the gaming industry forever. At first glance the
2309220	2315180	Famicom didn't look that remarkable. It was an 8-bit system in a time when Atari
2315180	2319700	had already given the world 16 bits of power and home computers were quickly
2319700	2325300	becoming more powerful still. Yet the Famicom did have a dedicated picture
2325300	2331260	processing unit in addition to its CPU as well as a reasonable launch price of
2331260	2336980	just under 15,000 yen. Its greatest asset would eventually be its game
2337020	2341540	selection but an impressive library took time and the Famicom's first year on
2341540	2347020	the Japanese market saw it get off to a slow start. It would pick up momentum
2347020	2352300	eventually however and the great gaming crash of 1983 didn't have nearly as
2352300	2357300	large an impact on Japan as it did America meaning by the end of 1984
2357300	2361620	Nintendo's family computer had become the best-selling console in Japan and
2361780	2368500	was well on its way to becoming Nintendo's greatest success yet. This still
2368500	2374620	left Nintendo's toughest challenge though America which in 1985 was still
2374620	2378980	reeling from the earlier crash with confidence in video games at an all-time
2378980	2384740	low. To get retailers to even stock their console Nintendo had to make buyback
2384740	2389500	deals in case of poor sales but that still left the even bigger problem of
2389860	2395740	selling the console in the first place. I mean how do you sell a gaming console to
2395740	2401340	a country that doesn't want anything to do with video games? Well Nintendo's
2401340	2404940	answer was to pretend that it was something different.
2419540	2425100	The extraordinary video robot he follows the commands you put on screen to help
2425100	2429380	you tackle even the toughest challenge. Will you be the first to raise the
2429380	2434380	incredibly accurate zapper and play games like Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. The
2434380	2439700	first to build a library of game packs like Kung Fu and Golf. Even games like
2439700	2444140	Excitebite that you program yourself. Will you be the first to get all this in
2444140	2449500	one package? The Nintendo Entertainment System where video technology is more
2449500	2455300	than a game. Enter the Nintendo Entertainment System not just a
2455300	2460340	video game console but something brand new and it wasn't just about the name.
2460340	2465260	The NES was designed to look like a video cassette recorder rather than a
2465260	2470980	console. Its cartridges were rebranded as game packs and it shipped with several
2470980	2477420	accessories like the robotic operating buddy Rob and the iconic light gun which
2477420	2482780	marketing made sure to emphasize as much as possible. Nintendo's work didn't
2482780	2488020	stop here though as they had an entire gaming market to rebuild and so the
2488020	2493660	number one priority became restoring consumer trust in video games. To do
2493660	2497940	this they strictly controlled third-party development putting limitations on
2497940	2503460	companies to avoid the oversaturation that have plagued Atari. In Japan this
2503460	2508380	led to a growing bootleg market so with the NES Nintendo added a special
2508380	2513660	lockout chip to combat this while creating an official Nintendo seal of
2513660	2519980	approval to allow buyers to identify Nintendo licensed products. And as for
2519980	2524620	those products Nintendo also paved the way for their console launch with arcade
2524620	2531340	releases of the same games through the Nintendo versus system in 1984 which was
2531340	2536620	built on similar hardware to the Famicom. This not only helped spread Nintendo's
2536620	2541260	name before the release of the NES but also established a trend of console
2541260	2546260	titles matching the quality of their arcade counterparts to try to repair the
2546260	2553740	damage of games like Pac-Man for the 2600. Nintendo even shifted to using in-game
2553780	2559180	like box art in place of the detailed yet dissimilar artwork of so many earlier
2559180	2566140	games. All this had an impact but Nintendo had one final ace up their sleeve
2566140	2571420	which came once more from the mind of Shigeru Miyamoto and would mark the
2571420	2580180	arrival of gaming's next killer app. Released in the same year as the NES
2580220	2586500	Super Mario Bros set a new standard. For years players had grown accustomed to
2586500	2592820	games taking place on a single screen and then in came Mario with side-scrolling
2592820	2598620	platforming action across multiple screens, multiple levels, multiple
2598620	2603660	environments and all with different power-ups, boss fights and jaw-dropping
2603660	2609100	hidden secrets. To top it all off Super Mario featured precise controls that took
2609140	2615060	full advantage of Nintendo's new D-pad controllers alongside detailed vibrant
2615060	2620140	visuals and one of the most iconic soundtracks in video game history from
2620140	2626420	composer Koji Kondo. Mario even had a strong sense of identity. By this point
2626420	2631460	in time a lot of games had featured space combat, sport simulations and fighting
2631460	2638180	but Mario offered something genuinely unique. You played as a shape-changing
2638380	2643900	mushroom-eating turtle-stomping Italian plumber who warped between worlds while
2643900	2649700	searching for a princess and somehow the concept worked with a childlike charm
2649700	2656820	that appealed to all ages. And so Super Mario Bros was a landmark title that
2656820	2661780	kicked off the greatest selling video game franchise of all time but it's not
2661780	2668380	like the NES only had Mario. In fact only a year and a half later the Nintendo
2668380	2673300	entertainment system would see the arrival of another gaming legend once
2673300	2684060	more from the mind of Miyamoto. The legend of Zelda did to action adventure games
2684060	2689540	what Super Mario Bros did to platformers. With a massive fantasy world fully
2689580	2694300	open to players and packed with secrets Zelda offered a sense of adventure and
2694300	2700100	freedom to explore never before seen in a console game. It was also the first
2700100	2704940	console game to feature a save system thanks to battery-powered memory built
2704940	2710540	into the game's cartridge which helped support its more ambitious design. And
2710540	2718500	once more the legend of Zelda was a huge critical and commercial success. As time
2718540	2723660	went on the NES's impressive library grew and grew launching many of gaming's
2723660	2727660	most loved series and establishing many of the rules of game design that would
2727660	2732580	continue to be seen for years to come. Castlevania brought action-packed Gothic
2732580	2738180	horror, Metroid brought atmospheric sci-fi, Mega Man offered alternative high
2738180	2742860	quality platforming action, Metal Gear helped popularize the stealth genre and
2742860	2748020	Dragon Quest and for later Final Fantasy established the Japanese console
2748020	2752900	role-playing genre. The NES was also well supported by high quality arcade
2752900	2759860	ports like Ghosts and Goblins, Contra and Double Dragon as well as a range of
2759860	2766420	Nintendo original sports games providing even more diversity. Basically the NES
2766420	2771140	had everything and it conquered the American and later European console
2771140	2777740	markets getting the gaming industry back in business in the process. This didn't
2777740	2781900	happen overnight and the damage done to the American market really was
2781900	2788020	significant but by 1989 the console market had finally bounced back close to
2788020	2794100	earlier levels with consumer confidence largely restored. Over its lifetime the
2794100	2799940	NES and Famicom sold around 62 million units which was more than double the
2799940	2804780	Atari 2600 making the NES the best-selling console of the time and
2804820	2809740	still one of the best-selling to this day. And with Nintendo's console
2809740	2813580	supremacy and so many American companies having exited the market
2813580	2818100	following the earlier crash, Japan was able to take center stage of the gaming
2818100	2824740	industry with Nintendo's name becoming synonymous with video games. Still even if
2824740	2829100	Nintendo had taken a sizable lead they wouldn't remain unchallenged for long
2829100	2834540	as another Japanese company was about to make their attempt at beating Nintendo
2834900	2836100	at their own game.
2843100	2847980	Sega was a big name in arcades. They entered the Japanese home console market
2847980	2852180	at the same time as Nintendo when the arcade Golden Age was starting to wind
2852180	2859700	down. Their first console the SG-1000 released in 1983 on the very same day
2860180	2864740	as Nintendo's Famicom but it would struggle to compete with Nintendo's
2864740	2869180	superior system likely as a result of Sega's inexperience with console
2869180	2876700	development. In 1985 it was redesigned as the Sega Mark 3 which released in
2876700	2881300	North America in 1986 as the Sega Master System.
2889700	2915620	The Master System went head-to-head with the NES while copying much of its
2915620	2920900	marketing strategy. In terms of hardware it had a clear advantage with a wider
2920900	2925860	color palette and a small edge in raw power but this wouldn't be enough to
2925860	2932660	make up for its biggest weakness its lack of third-party support. To publish games
2932660	2938820	on the NES licensees had to agree to a strict two-year non-compete clause that
2938820	2944460	didn't allow them to bring their titles to Nintendo's competition. This left the
2944460	2948980	Master System with a much smaller library and while Sega were able to bring
2948980	2953420	their own first-party arcade titles including the fast-paced rail shooter
2953420	2958420	Space Harrier and iconic racing game Outrun two of the best arcade titles of
2958420	2963180	the mid-80s this ultimately didn't prove to be enough and even these games
2963180	2969300	were still inferior on console than as arcade originals. This ensured that
2969300	2974220	Sega failed to come close to matching Nintendo in Japan or North America
2974220	2978820	although they did do enough to overtake a flagging Atari who under new
2978820	2984780	management had released their own third-generation console the 7800 a system
2984780	2990740	notable for its innovative backwards compatibility and little else. Still by
2990740	2996220	this point gaming was global and so Sega turned their attention to other markets.
2996820	3001540	In Europe the NES had failed to achieve the same level of success as in America
3001540	3006500	with Nintendo taking a more hands-off approach and leaving the distribution to
3006500	3012300	other companies. It also arrived notably late with most countries not seeing the
3012300	3018780	NES until 1987. This was the same year Sega brought over the Master System and
3018780	3023620	with no more head start and Sega's strong reputation as an arcade developer
3023620	3031060	Sega started to beat Nintendo for the very first time. By 1990 the Master
3031060	3037060	System was Europe's best-selling console and Sega didn't stop at Europe. In fact
3037060	3042100	a deal with toy and electronics company Tectoy saw Brazil become the Master
3042100	3048860	System's single best-selling country after its release in 1989. By contrast the
3048860	3055140	NES didn't come to Brazil until 1993 giving Sega a unique chance to capture a
3055140	3060340	by no means insignificant market. Sega wouldn't be the only new challenger
3060340	3065380	amidst the now once more growing gaming industry however.
3078860	3103420	Hudson Soft and NEC's Turbografics 16 released in 1987 in Japan under the name
3103420	3110740	PC Engine and in 1989 in America and Europe. The console was so eager to let
3110740	3115100	consumers know that it was a 16-bit rather than 8-bit system that it
3115100	3121060	included it in the name kicking off what is sometimes referred to as the Bit Wars
3121060	3127300	as well as the fourth generation of home consoles. As the first truly next-gen
3127300	3131620	system the Turbografics did boast some impressive hardware with a higher
3131660	3138420	resolution and expanded color palette to go alongside its 16-bit GPU. This was
3138420	3142580	matched with some impressive sales in its home region of Japan with the system
3142580	3146340	getting off to a flying start and beating out the NES in its year of
3146340	3150940	release. Unfortunately this strong performance wasn't replicated in other
3150940	3155420	regions with poor marketing and a delayed release leading to commercial
3155420	3161900	failure in North America and cancelled plans in Europe. Still for Sega this new
3161900	3167060	competition represented a clear threat and so in response they immediately began
3167060	3173740	working on their own 16-bit system. It was finished one year later long before
3173740	3178300	Nintendo would have a 16-bit system themselves and it turned out to be
3178300	3180420	Sega's best console yet.
3209300	3216260	The Sega Genesis otherwise known as the Mega Drive outside America released in
3216260	3224900	1988 in Japan, 1989 in America and 1990 in other regions and with it Sega now had
3224900	3230020	a system powerful enough to do justice to their expansive arcade library as well
3230020	3236820	as a clear technological lead on their main rival Nintendo. They even had a new
3236940	3238940	marketing slogan.
3257940	3263660	And so heading into the next decade the console war was finally heating up with
3263660	3269660	one of gaming's greatest rivalries about one-fold. The only thing Sega still
3269660	3274980	needed was a killer app of their own that could finally go head-to-head with
3274980	3281300	Nintendo's popular mascot Mario. But for Nintendo there was no reason to panic
3281300	3286740	just yet as the end of the 80s saw them release a new system of their own one
3286740	3290940	that would go on to outsell all of their previous systems combined.
3297940	3303940	Nintendo's Game & Watch was a success but its LCD technology limited it to one
3303940	3309700	game per system. For Gunpei Yokoi's next console he wanted to create a handheld
3309700	3314740	device with interchangeable games that offered an NES-like experience on the
3314740	3316740	go. This was the result.
3345740	3352620	The Game Boy released in 1989 and was around in various iterations for the
3352620	3358500	next 20 years during which Nintendo dominated the handheld market the
3358500	3365140	entire time. It did require four AA batteries but this was a price players
3365140	3371220	were more than happy to pay. It also lacked a backlight which was more of an
3371220	3375500	issue. A contrast dial was included but this still meant the system was
3375500	3380380	unplayable without a light source and even in a well-lit environment the gray
3380380	3387220	and green color scheme didn't provide the best clarity or general aesthetic. To
3387220	3391380	make matters worse the Game Boy released against heavy competition with three
3391380	3396220	other handhelds also vying for dominance at the same time. Atari's Lynx,
3396220	3404220	Sega's Game Gear and NEC's Turbo Express. All three of these rivals blew the
3404220	3410060	Game Boy away in technical capabilities featuring not only a backlit screen but
3410060	3415740	also full-color and far more impressive graphics. By comparison the drab
3415740	3420860	grays and greens of the Game Boy must have seemed rather pathetic. A sentiment
3420860	3425900	held by many even at Nintendo during its development where the Game Boy had earned
3425900	3434300	the nickname DUMMER GAME a pun which basically translates to BAD GAME. In the
3434300	3438460	end though the Game Boy wound up punching far above its weight and easily
3438460	3443140	surpassed all competition proving that in the constantly advancing battleground
3443140	3447980	of cutting-edge technology that is the gaming industry sometimes having the
3447980	3453020	best specs isn't what matters the most. You see in return for a less
3453100	3457100	technologically advanced product Nintendo offered something at a more
3457100	3462460	affordable price with a much longer battery life and a durable more
3462460	3468700	child-proof design. If success was down to critics the Game Boy would have come
3468700	3474380	last. In reality however success is decided by the consumer which in this
3474380	3480860	case often meant parents and it turned out that in this example practicality
3480860	3487260	and affordability beat superior technology and it wasn't even close. For
3487260	3491100	Gunpei Yokoi this must have been the ultimate vindication of his design
3491100	3495740	philosophy which has been translated as lateral thinking with
3495740	3501100	withered technology i.e achieving success through finding new and
3501100	3507980	innovative ways to use cheap or mature technology. In an industry obsessed with
3507980	3511980	the cutting-edge this has been successfully employed by Nintendo
3511980	3517180	time and time again and despite Yokoi's unfortunate death in 1997
3517180	3522140	his philosophy can still be seen within the company to this day.
3522140	3526300	Of course this is only part of the Game Boy's success story
3526300	3531900	because it also had another advantage over the competition.
3531900	3537020	Designed inside the Soviet Union by Alexey Pachinov in 1984
3537020	3542860	Tetris began life as more of a benchmark than an actual video game.
3542860	3546700	In a time long before anyone could ask can it play crisis
3546700	3550700	computer engineer Pachinov had to settle for developing his own games
3550700	3555100	as a way to test the capabilities of the latest hardware.
3555100	3558700	The idea for Tetris came from trying to recreate the puzzle game
3558700	3564700	Pentominos when Pachinov had the idea to make the pieces descend vertically.
3564700	3569260	The lack of a graphical interface on the Electronica 60 Pachinov was working on
3569260	3574140	did pose a slight problem but it wasn't enough to stop Tetris's core idea from
3574140	3577740	being enjoyable and soon Pachinov was sharing his
3577740	3582700	creation with his friends and eventually making an IBM PC version
3582700	3587180	with the help of a talented 16 year old school student.
3587180	3590460	From here Tetris spread like a contagious virus
3590460	3594940	first infecting Pachinov's office then the whole Academy of Science
3594940	3599020	before moving across Moscow and then beyond
3599020	3602220	doing what few Soviet citizens of the time could do
3602220	3607020	and crossing the Iron Curtain. This kicked off a race from multiple eager
3607020	3611580	parties to acquire the rights of the game for broader distribution in the west.
3611580	3615660	The only problem with the situation was that the Soviet Union
3615660	3618780	didn't really believe in copyright law
3618780	3622700	outside of everything should be controlled by the state
3622700	3625500	leading to confusion over who owned the rights of the game
3625500	3628700	and a complicated battle between different competing parties
3628700	3632220	with plenty of buying and selling of rights that sellers
3632220	3637980	didn't actually own. The ultimate winner was game designer Henk Rogers
3637980	3643740	who acquired the rights for Nintendo. The original plan for the Game Boy was to
3643740	3647820	sell it alongside the new Mario title Super Mario Land
3647820	3651900	but Nintendo was so impressed by Tetris after Rogers showed it to them
3651900	3655580	that they followed his advice to use it instead
3655580	3658380	in the hopes that its simple addictive nature
3658380	3662540	could transcend experience age and gender barriers
3662540	3667420	to be a game that everyone could enjoy and it was.
3667420	3671340	At first glance Tetris might seem similar to popular arcade games of 10
3671420	3675340	years earlier but with no concerns about maximizing quarters
3675340	3678540	Tetris considerably lowered the initial difficulty
3678540	3682700	and this did result in a game that anyone could play
3682700	3686860	as it eased people into the experience while naturally building tension and
3686860	3690940	excitement as the game progressed. Tetris required
3690940	3693980	fast moment-to-moment reactions as well as broader
3693980	3697580	more strategic planning and when players made a mistake
3697580	3702140	it was obvious where they went wrong and what they could do better next time.
3702140	3705660	For the pick up and play Game Boy it was a perfect match
3705660	3708940	and it went on to sell tens of millions of copies
3708940	3714060	on Nintendo's new system alone as well as many millions more
3714060	3718460	across PC NES and later mobile versions
3718460	3722540	making it potentially the best selling game ever made
3722620	3728220	even to this day. This helped the Game Boy get off to a strong start right from its
3728220	3732140	launch which meant as the 80s grew to a close
3732140	3736700	Nintendo retained their dominant position as leaders of the gaming industry
3736700	3742780	having far surpassed Atari and held off the new challenge presented by Sega.
3742780	3747340	All this time however as console and arcade giants froze and fell
3747340	3751260	another section of the industry experienced its own story
3751260	3755180	one with a different starting place, different games
3755180	3759660	and a very different impact on the future.
3763740	3770060	World War II was kind of a big deal. In addition to deciding the fate of a
3770060	3773900	global population and shaping the modern world as we know it
3773900	3777500	it also saw rapid technological advancement that would pave the way for
3777500	3782860	something equally important, the home computer.
3782860	3787740	Originally computer game development was limited to only the most enthusiastic
3787740	3792060	hobbyists. This started in the early 70s with one
3792060	3797820	of the first and most well-known examples being 1971's Star Trek a
3797820	3801180	text-based strategy game where players took control of the USS
3801180	3805500	enterprise to hunt down Klingon warships.
3805500	3811180	Other early examples include Oregon Trail a text-based strategy game best known
3811180	3816300	via its later incarnations 1976's Colossal Cave Adventure
3816300	3819900	a text-based adventure game inspired by real-life caving
3819900	3825900	and Dungeons and Dragons 1977's Empire a turn-based war game
3825900	3832540	inspired by the board game Risk Zork also in 1977 and also a text-based
3832540	3835980	adventure game inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure
3835980	3839820	and Mud or Multi-User Dungeon a text-based
3839820	3847660	real-time multiplayer role-playing game that helped pioneer the MMO genre in 1978.
3847660	3852060	Of these six examples all except Colossal Cave Adventure
3852060	3858300	were created by students. In fact Star Trek was created by a high school
3858300	3862140	student who had started hanging around the University of California Irving's
3862140	3867820	computer lab in his free time. So for computer games it was teenagers who
3867820	3870540	led the way maybe due to the younger generation's
3870540	3874220	inherent creativity but also because computers were so expensive
3874220	3878220	that university students were some of the only people who had reliable access
3878220	3882380	to them. This started to change in 1977
3882380	3887020	with the arrival of not one but three more affordable home computers
3887020	3892060	the Commodore PET, the TRS-80 and the Apple II.
3892060	3895020	If you want to know what affordable means
3895020	3898620	in numerical form well the most successful of these
3898620	3908860	the Apple II cost $1,298 at release which is over $6,400 after inflation.
3908860	3914220	So maybe not affordable for most but it was a start.
3914220	3918300	These early computers tended to ship with some games included
3918300	3924060	but they also came with something else. Basic, a general purpose programming
3924060	3928380	language that gave computer owners not just the ability to play games
3928380	3933340	but also to make them themselves and they did.
3933340	3936380	The best known example of this is Sierra Online
3936380	3940300	founded by husband and wife duo Ken and Roberta Williams
3940300	3943900	after playing Colossal Cave Adventure and deciding to make their own
3943900	3948220	similar game on a family member's borrowed Apple II.
3948220	3951580	The result was the first ever graphical adventure game
3951580	3955340	Mystery House, a murder mystery focused game
3955340	3959980	inspired by Agatha Christie novels and one of the earliest examples of both
3959980	3965180	graphics in a PC game and horror in any video game.
3965180	3968620	Sierra Online went on to have numerous hits including
3968620	3974140	King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry and Quest for Glory.
3974140	3978940	Another example is a Calabeth, the first ever computer role-playing game
3978940	3983580	made by a teenage Richard Garriott in 1979
3983580	3987900	originally on his school's mainframe pc and finished on an Apple II
3987900	3992060	bought by his father. Garriott sold the game at his local
3992060	3997740	computer store in a ziplock bag with a cover sheet drawn by his mom
3997820	4001580	until a copy of the game made it to California Pacific Computer Company
4001580	4004620	who signed the deal with Garriott to take over publication
4004620	4010460	and sold 30,000 copies. The founders of Codemasters, the Darling Brothers, have a
4010460	4014700	similar story where they became wealthy and established game
4014700	4020620	developers by the ripe old age of 16 and 17 selling
4020620	4026700	games by mail order from their bedroom. Arcade and console gaming became
4026700	4029580	corporate almost as soon as it came into existence
4029580	4033980	but by contrast the computer gaming industry was heavily grass roots
4033980	4038220	with hobbyists, bedroom coders and literal children
4038220	4042540	often leading the way laying the foundations for the entire industry
4042540	4046860	and proving just what these new home computers were capable of.
4046860	4051660	This did mean the PC scene was much slower to monetize their efforts
4051660	4055500	with piracy known at the time as sharing
4055500	4058860	being such common practice that many people weren't even aware it could be
4058860	4062460	considered wrong and what started as sharing between
4062460	4066300	friends quickly evolved into selling bootleg copies for a fraction of the
4066300	4070460	original price. The differences between computer
4070460	4073740	and console gaming doesn't stop here though
4073740	4078220	from the higher age of the average player to the higher price of the systems
4078220	4082220	to the vastly different control schemes to regional differences
4082220	4085900	with PC gaming particularly flourishing in Europe the same region where
4085900	4090700	consoles caught on the slowest. PC gaming basically grew up independently
4090700	4094940	to the rest of the gaming industry and nowhere is this more evident
4094940	4100700	than in actual game design. Arcade games started off simple.
4100700	4103740	They were highly replayable and fiendishly challenging
4103740	4107740	in large part due to their monetization and they tended to focus
4107740	4113260	on skill-based gameplay experiences that came alongside arcade specific features
4113260	4119260	like high scores and lives. Console games then grew out of this foundation
4119260	4124220	with Atari and Sega owing much of their console success to their arcade ports
4124220	4127660	and the NES's library being packed with games which
4127660	4132300	emulated many aspects of popular arcade titles of the era.
4132300	4136140	PC games however were quick to embrace complexity.
4136140	4140460	Text adventures like Zork gave players a staggering amount of freedom in their
4140460	4144620	text inputs while mods did similar while adding in
4144620	4150140	other human players as well. 1980s genre pioneer Rogue
4150140	4154300	offered a huge randomly generated world for players to progress through.
4154300	4158220	Groundbreaking RPGs like 1981's Wizardry or
4158220	4161740	Ultima provided deep dungeon-crawling overworld
4161740	4167420	spanning adventures with plenty of statistics, classes and items.
4167420	4170620	In many of these titles gameplay seemed to take a backseat
4170620	4176220	to trying to simulate a rich virtual world for players to become immersed in.
4176220	4178940	Many of these games were still highly challenging
4178940	4182140	but less emphasis was placed on constant fail states
4182140	4186940	and replayability with difficulty instead often coming from
4186940	4191980	depth and low fidelity visuals be they text,
4191980	4197420	ASCII or spreadsheet were often embraced as a way to provide greater freedom
4197420	4200700	and maybe as a way for programmers to avoid learning to draw
4200700	4206460	or hiring artists. In time many of these differentiators would become less clear
4206460	4210620	as the borders between PC and console would gradually erode
4210620	4213900	with Japanese role-playing games being an obvious example of
4213900	4218300	cross-pollination but this process occurred slowly
4218300	4221420	and many of these same differences between computer games
4221420	4225980	and their console cousins are still evident today.
4225980	4229820	Still as the 80s evolved so too did the home computer
4229820	4234460	with systems becoming more affordable amidst rising competition.
4234460	4237660	It seems everybody is interested now in home computers
4237660	4241020	well so far home computers are just a fraction
4241020	4244380	a small fraction of those being sold in the United States
4244380	4247980	but because our technology is growing by leaps and bounds
4247980	4251180	computers can help us with a lot of household items
4251180	4254860	for grown-ups as well as for the kids. The next generation of computers would
4254860	4259740	include the ZX series from Sinclair, NEC's PC series,
4259740	4265980	the Atari 8-bit family, the BBC Micro and the Amstrad CPC.
4266060	4269660	The best selling of these was the Commodore 64
4269660	4274620	which released just under $600 and holds the world record as the highest
4274620	4278460	selling single computer model of all time.
4278460	4281900	At the same time as this computing heavyweight IBM
4281900	4285900	launched their now iconic personal computer series
4285900	4291580	popularizing the term PC. These came with Microsoft's DOS operating
4291580	4296620	system and supported open software development for the first time.
4296620	4300700	Before this all home computers were incompatible systems
4300700	4303660	meaning all programs had to be ported to specific systems
4303660	4307420	to meet the individual hardware requirements of each one.
4307420	4311020	The IBM PC and its many subsequent clones
4311020	4314140	instead allowed software to be ported much more easily
4314140	4318540	which ultimately greatly benefited game development.
4318620	4321980	Hardware wasn't the only thing improving in this period though.
4321980	4326780	By the mid-80s PC games were also making impressive strides.
4326780	4330700	1984's King Quest from Sierra showed the evolution of the graphic adventure
4330700	4335100	genre with an animated protagonist and interactive world.
4335100	4339820	Space Sim Elite broke new ground by adding advanced 3D graphics
4339820	4345340	and action gameplay into an incredibly deep and open space sandbox.
4345340	4349420	Ultima 4 in 1985 set a new standard for role-playing games
4349420	4352860	by moving them beyond their established dungeon crawler formula
4352860	4356940	with a more expansive world, a richer more nuanced story
4356940	4360860	and a new moral choice-driven approach to game design.
4360860	4365100	1987's Dungeon Master on the other hand evolved the dungeon crawler
4365100	4370300	into the realm of 3D with added real-time combat elements.
4370300	4374380	The 80s also saw the merging of entertainment and education
4374380	4379020	in several fondly remembered edutainment games.
4379020	4384140	The 1985 version of the Oregon Trail taught children history
4384140	4389020	as well as the dangers of dysentery, typhoid and rivers.
4389020	4394140	While the also released in 1985 where in the world is Carmen San Diego
4394140	4399020	taught geography and the dangers of art theft.
4399020	4402140	Of course the Oregon Trail was also an enjoyable strategy game
4402140	4406460	with genuine emergent storytelling and rogue-like random generation
4406460	4411420	years before rogue even existed and where in the world is Carmen San Diego
4411420	4416540	was a very well made adventure game with strong replayability.
4416540	4420220	In some ways the educational elements of such games were light
4420220	4423500	but that didn't stop them showing up in thousands of schools
4423500	4427180	tricking children into learning or tricking teachers
4427180	4432060	into letting children play games during school depending on your perspective.
4432540	4436060	Ultimately edutainment computer games were a trend which
4436060	4439500	didn't really catch on but they still serve as a valuable reminder
4439500	4443500	of a time when gaming was in its infancy and developers were exploring
4443500	4447580	novel applications of this new exciting medium.
4447580	4451100	By the end of the 80s the era of bedroom coders
4451100	4455900	was coming to a close with husband and wife duos and pioneering teenagers
4455900	4460700	soon being replaced or going on to found legitimate development teams
4460780	4466540	with professional work environments. One such company, Electronic Arts, would
4466540	4470860	see a major breakthrough within 1988 John Madden Football
4470860	4473900	a game which would not only kick off one of the industry's largest sports
4473900	4476700	series but also showed the more mainstream direction
4476700	4481900	PC games were now heading in. 1988 also saw the release of
4481900	4486140	Pool of Radiance the first in a long line of Gold Box Dungeons and Dragons
4486140	4489500	RPGs where after years of video games taking
4489500	4493340	inspiration from D&D they were now finally starting to make that
4493340	4497580	relationship official. With home computers continuing to
4497580	4501260	become more affordable PC gaming ended the decade in a promising
4501260	4504540	place. Its early years should perhaps best be
4504540	4509100	remembered as a time of innovation and enthusiasm.
4509100	4514060	The computer gaming market started small. Popularity was created through word of
4514060	4518780	mouth and sharing between friends. Creators enjoyed unprecedented levels
4518780	4522540	of creative freedom and monetization was often a distant
4522540	4526140	afterthought. Yet many of the games produced from this
4526140	4530300	era were just as impressive as their console and arcade rivals
4530300	4536060	albeit often in very different ways. Regardless the impact of these games on
4536060	4540380	the industry was considerable and gaming wasn't the only thing
4540380	4544140	they impacted. In a time where the personal computer
4544140	4548380	was a brand new invention computer games also played a significant role
4548380	4552140	in showcasing just what this new piece of technology could do
4552140	4556140	and in popularizing the idea that a computer could be more than just a
4556140	4560460	machine for work. And so even if the history of computer
4560460	4563660	games stands somewhat separate to the rest of the industry
4563660	4567420	it still played a vital role and its importance would only grow
4567420	4570540	as the years went by.
4570940	4580300	Gaming's early years were tumultuous with lawsuits bankruptcy and corporate
4580300	4583980	takeovers coming alongside innovations and breakthroughs
4583980	4587180	all while technology progressed at breakneck speeds
4587180	4590220	leaving both software and hardware behind
4590220	4595340	after only a few years. Within this chaos the video game industry
4595420	4600860	rose fell rose fell and then finally rose again
4600860	4605820	and each time there was a connection to the quality of the games.
4605820	4609500	First with the novelty of Pong before the industry got smothered in an
4609500	4613260	abundance of Pong clones then with the golden age of the arcade
4613260	4616380	and Atari's move to bring that golden age to consoles
4616380	4620780	before a massive low quality cheaply produced games once more sunk Atari
4620780	4624780	and much of the industry with them and then finally with Nintendo
4624780	4628380	bringing new life to the industry with their higher standard of quality
4628380	4633980	and groundbreaking flagship series. The evolution of the gaming industry
4633980	4637500	wasn't exactly smooth but by the end of the 80s
4637500	4645420	video games had come a long way. In 1972 there was Pong. In 1989
4645420	4649340	Prince of Persia on the Apple II used rotoscoping technology to reduce
4649340	4654140	smooth true-to-life animations. Shadow of the Beast on the Amiga combined
4654140	4657100	detailed sprite work with parallax scrolling
4657100	4660860	to create stunning backgrounds. Final fight on arcades
4660860	4664140	up the level of detail and the amount of things on screen at once
4664140	4668460	to seriously impressive levels and even on consoles
4668460	4672540	the new generation of 16-bit systems was starting to really show what those 16
4672540	4675660	bits could do with games like Golden Axe providing much
4675660	4678700	better visuals than was seen in the last generation
4678700	4683660	and it wasn't just graphics. On the NES developers experience with
4683660	4687020	designing games and their familiarity with the system
4687020	4691820	was also showing dividends. Take the opening of the famously difficult
4691820	4699580	action platformer Ninja Gaiden.
4713820	4732700	Sound, visuals and cinematic style are all combined masterfully here to create
4732700	4737020	some really compelling storytelling that draws players in and contextualizes
4737020	4743260	what you actually do in game and it does all this in less than a minute.
4743260	4746780	Meanwhile on PC games like the City Builder
4746780	4752620	SimCity or God Game Populous for once more treading new ground and creating
4752620	4757180	new genres that challenged how people thought about video games.
4757180	4760700	Still if you really want to see how far games have come
4760700	4765420	no single title illustrated it better than the latest entry in Nintendo's
4765420	4768860	most iconic series.
4769660	4773820	Widely considered one of the greatest games ever made
4773820	4776780	and as close to perfect as a sequel can be
4776780	4781100	Super Mario Bros 3 is the pinnacle of the NES library
4781100	4784460	and it still holds up all these years later.
4784460	4788060	Where some NES sequels went in bold new directions
4788060	4792620	not always with the best results the third game in the Super Mario series
4792620	4795820	instead takes everything which worked about the first title
4795820	4801580	and does it bigger and better. From the new overworld to multiple new power-ups
4801580	4805420	new enemies larger levels enhanced visuals an expanded moveset
4805420	4810540	multiplayer and a much longer runtime it was a game which did quite a bit to
4810540	4814220	impress but what shined brightest of all was its
4814220	4818460	creative level design. Every world had its own theme
4818460	4822540	every stage felt distinct and new things were introduced constantly
4822540	4826460	with the player never quite sure what to expect next.
4826460	4829260	Somehow in just three years since the first game
4829260	4833980	the team behind Super Mario Bros 3 worked out how to make the perfect 2D
4833980	4841020	Mario game and then they did it. Games had come a long way
4841020	4845180	but in the grand scheme of things they were just getting started
4845180	4848860	and the next decade would bring even more progress
4848860	4853020	more change and more drama.
4859660	4864300	By the start of the 90s the gaming industry was well and truly established.
4864300	4867500	With the launch of the Game Boy Nintendo had cemented their status as the
4867500	4870940	market leader but the aging Nintendo entertainment system
4870940	4875420	was now facing tough competition from Sega's next generation Genesis
4875420	4879900	setting the stage for one of gaming's most legendary rivalries.
4879900	4882700	Meanwhile the increasing affordability of the personal computer
4882700	4886060	was making PC games a more serious part of the industry
4886060	4889900	while gaming itself was moving ever towards the mainstream
4889900	4894780	with bigger budgets bigger names and bigger controversies.
4894780	4899260	Overall though the 90s was a time of rapid technological progress.
4899260	4903980	A bit of a decade the 8-bit NES a third generation console
4903980	4907740	was the best selling on the market yet by the decades close
4907740	4912300	consoles were entering their sixth generation with 128 bits of computing
4912300	4916620	power inside much more advanced systems. Graphics
4916620	4919340	would transition from 2D sprites and pixel based
4919340	4923020	to the brave new three-dimensional world of polygons.
4923020	4926700	Cartridges were replaced by the much higher capacity CD-ROM.
4926700	4931260	Multiple new genres of games emerged including the most popular of all time.
4931260	4935100	Massive franchises were established including the most successful of all
4935100	4938780	time and game design experienced its own evolution
4938780	4943500	as developers raced to keep up with the continually changing times.
4943500	4947500	Before all this however the decade began with action
4947500	4950700	and while the fighting between consoles might be what's most remembered
4950700	4955180	about the 90s arcades also had some important fighting of their own to do
4955180	4961260	first.
4961980	4965980	Arcade growth came to a stop following the crash of 1983
4965980	4969340	but arcades still made up a large part of the market afterwards
4969340	4972940	and they still continue to offer the definitive video game experience by way
4972940	4978380	of graphics and immersion for those who had the quarters to play.
4978380	4982620	By the start of the 16-bit era however their technological edge was narrowing
4982620	4986460	and even arcade heavyweight sega had started to move away from marketing
4986460	4989980	itself as the company that brought the arcade experience home
4989980	4994460	due to the perception of arcades losing relevance within the industry.
4994460	4998300	Most people probably expected the 90s to be the decade where arcade games
4998300	5002300	quietly disappeared and maybe that would have happened
5002300	5013740	if not for the arrival of one game that changed everything.
5013740	5017100	Street Fighter 2 wasn't technically the first fighting game
5017100	5022380	but you'd be forgiven for thinking it was. Reaching arcades in 1991 it
5022380	5026380	represented a massive evolution from Capcom's 1987 predecessor
5026380	5029660	and brought many of the staples people have come to expect from the genre
5029660	5033580	including combo mechanics, precise joystick controls
5033580	5038620	and a focus on face-to-face player versus player action.
5038620	5041900	Before Street Fighter 2 competitive video games were about
5041900	5045740	high scores and so the competition was indirect
5045740	5049340	but Street Fighter 2 allowed players to go head-to-head
5049340	5054460	making competition more active, exciting and genuine.
5054460	5057660	This was a major step for gaming and paved the way for the concept of death
5057660	5061100	matches as well as more serious competitive tournaments
5061100	5066460	and games as a form of esports. For arcades though fighting games was
5066460	5071340	simply a match made in heaven and they instantly brought new life to the scene.
5071340	5074860	The social nature of arcades was a perfect fit for a genre that was about
5074860	5078940	being the best and winning in style and the popularity of Street Fighter was
5078940	5082380	explosive causing a significant resurgence in arcades
5082380	5085500	before soon going on to be one of the highest selling console games of the
5085500	5090940	next generation and leaving an immediate impact on pop culture.
5090940	5093900	Street Fighter 2 was soon met with competition itself
5093900	5098780	first from SNK's Fatal Fury in late 91 then from Midway's
5098780	5103980	infamously violent Mortal Kombat in 92 before arcades once more cemented
5103980	5106620	themselves as the leaders of video game technology
5106620	5111260	with the cutting-edge 3D of Virtua Fighter from Sega in 93
5111260	5115820	and Namco's Tekken in 94 with a whole host of other smaller names
5115820	5119820	springing up along the way. For a time fighting games were the hottest
5119820	5123580	genre in gaming and they made a lot of money in the process
5123580	5126780	with Electronic Gaming Monthly reporting that in Japan
5126780	5130780	fighting games accounted for 80% of all gaming sales
5130780	5135420	in 1996. Other important advancements in arcades
5135420	5140220	came from the move to 3D technology which preceded the jump to 3D seen in the
5140220	5144300	next generation of consoles and was in large part the result of a rivalry
5144300	5149740	between Sega and Namco. This can be seen in Virtua Fighter and Tekken
5149740	5153020	as well as a number of notable racing and light gun games
5153020	5159500	including Virtua Racing, Daytona USA, Virtua Cop and House of the Dead from Sega
5159500	5164540	and Ridge Racer, Point Blank and Time Crisis from Namco.
5164540	5167980	Konami's highly original rhythm-based Dance Dance Revolution
5167980	5173900	in 1998 also proved highly influential. Still while arcades might have seen a
5173900	5178060	renaissance in the early and mid 90s this was ultimately only
5178060	5181740	enough to delay the inevitable and as the decade grew to a close
5181740	5186460	amidst a surging console market arcades once more entered into a period of
5186460	5192220	decline as the era of the arcade gradually came to an end.
5192220	5196300	Today arcades mostly exist as a nostalgic relic of the past
5196300	5200300	but their importance on gaming history was enormous.
5200300	5204460	For years arcades were the largest and most technologically advanced section of
5204460	5207980	the industry and in addition to producing many of gaming's greatest
5207980	5212620	titles they also left an enduring impact on gaming culture.
5212620	5216060	Still while arcades might have kicked off the decade's action
5216060	5221820	it would be consoles that would take the fighting to a whole other level.
5222620	5228620	Sega Shot First
5228620	5232380	In addition to beating Nintendo out the gates in entering the fourth generation
5232380	5236060	Sega was also responsible for making things personal by deliberately
5236060	5241100	targeting Nintendo in their marketing.
5241100	5245580	Conventional wisdom might suggest that naming and by extension giving publicity
5245580	5249020	to your main competitor in your own marketing
5249020	5252540	isn't the best strategy yet conventional wisdom
5252540	5258220	isn't always correct. Genesis does may be the most famous gaming commercial of
5258220	5263020	all time and it exemplified the spirit of the fourth generation.
5263020	5266620	Taking shots at Nintendo wasn't the only part of Sega of America's grand
5266620	5269180	strategy however they also sought to create a
5269180	5272860	strong library of unique games which would appeal to western audiences
5272860	5277740	and help make the Genesis stand out. Early examples of this can be seen with
5277740	5281660	Michael Jackson's Moonwalker and several celebrity-induced sports games
5281660	5285420	like Joe Montana Football or Pat Riley Basketball.
5285420	5289020	These still didn't provide Sega with a true system salary needed though
5289020	5293180	and to make matters worse their head start only lasted so long
5293180	5298380	as in November of 1990 Nintendo's much anticipated 16-bit system finally
5298380	5303020	launched in Japan alongside the latest entry of one of gaming's now most
5303020	5307340	iconic series Super Mario World. In a head-to-head
5307340	5310540	comparison there wasn't a lot to differentiate the two competing pieces
5310540	5313740	of hardware. The Genesis did have an advantage in
5313740	5317500	pure CPU power but the Super Nintendo boasted more RAM,
5317500	5323020	better sound quality, more on-screen colors and more detailed sprites.
5323020	5327180	The systems were also similarly priced meaning it was games that would be the
5327180	5331420	ultimate deciding factor and it was here that Sega was about
5331420	5336940	to make their most important play yet. Mario had launched Nintendo into the
5336940	5341100	home console market and was seen as central to Nintendo's success
5341100	5345580	so Sega decided they needed their own Mario.
5345580	5349260	Work on the character design started all the way back in 1988
5349260	5353580	and went through multiple revisions with Sega Japan and Sega America working
5353580	5357580	together and often disagreeing over the direction.
5357580	5360780	Central to the design was the decision to emphasize speed
5360780	5365260	and to appeal to Western audiences with designer Naoto Oshima
5365260	5370380	even going to New York to ask locals in Central Park their opinion on the design
5370380	5374060	which ultimately led to a blue hedgehog by the name
5374060	5378540	of Sonic. The emphasis on speed carried over to game design
5378540	5382380	with the team wanting Sonic's default speed to be equal to Mario's running
5382380	5385980	speed and for his running speed to be a great deal
5385980	5389820	faster. This led to many animation and frame rate
5389820	5392300	problems but the team stuck with the idea
5392300	5397100	not wanting to compromise their desire for players to go fast.
5397100	5400860	Levels were then designed to be large and non-linear to take advantage of the
5400860	5404700	main character's enhanced movement while also once again being seen as a
5404700	5408540	straight upgrade to the levels seen in Mario.
5408540	5412380	Finally vibrant colors and a laid-back soundtrack were used to give the game a
5412380	5416220	strong sense of identity and in summer 1991
5416220	5419660	the project was complete with Sonic the Hedgehog
5419660	5423500	releasing worldwide about two months before the North American release of
5423500	5430300	the Super Nintendo and so at long last Sega had their killer app.
5430300	5433820	Gotta go. Hey guy you're the first serious gamer I've seen all morning check
5433820	5438060	this out brand new 16-bit Super Nintendo in Super Mario World!
5438060	5443020	Wow! What's this one? Oh this is a Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega Genesis.
5443020	5446940	Look at these radical colors huh? Wow Sonic's fast too.
5447260	5450620	Over here! I like Genesis and it costs a lot less.
5450620	5454620	Look here! I'll take Sonic and Genesis.
5454620	5458300	Sonic was an immediate success and with it the Genesis outsold the Super
5458300	5462860	Nintendo 2 to 1 in the 1991 US holiday season
5462860	5467980	with Sega taking a 65% share of the 16-bit market.
5467980	5471500	Meanwhile in Europe Sega performed even better as the Super Nintendo
5471500	5475980	wouldn't see an EU release until mid 1992.
5475980	5479660	This was one of the major differences between Nintendo and Sega at the time
5479660	5483340	as while Sega were pioneering the idea of a global release for systems
5483340	5487020	and software Nintendo were by contrast much slower
5487020	5490860	at bringing their products to other markets. In the end
5490860	5494540	this paid off for Sega and allowed them to take a clear lead over their rival
5494540	5498940	for the very first time and this wasn't the only advantage
5498940	5503340	Sega now had. Their greatest weakness in the last generation
5503340	5506860	third-party support would no longer be a problem after Sega
5506860	5510380	entered the market early and offered publishers much more favorable license
5510380	5514300	in terms than Nintendo. They also worked hard to stay on top of
5514300	5519340	hardware developments releasing the Sega CD or Mega CD in 1992
5519340	5524140	as an add-on for the Genesis. The Sega CD wasn't cheap and its sales
5524140	5527660	numbers were relatively modest but it did offer a more high-end
5527660	5531340	product to those who wanted it and the new CD technology provided much
5531340	5534780	greater storage capacity allowing for more detailed audio
5534780	5539900	and entirely new types of games like Bose focused on full motion video.
5539900	5544700	Lastly Sega also didn't slow down with their aggressive marketing.
5544700	5548220	The Sega Genesis has blast processing. Super Nintendo
5548220	5552460	doesn't. So what's blast processing do?
5562300	5567100	And uh what if you don't have blast processing?
5574300	5578540	It is debatable whether blast processing is even real
5578540	5582940	but one thing everyone can agree on is that the Super Nintendo
5582940	5587740	doesn't have it. I mean sure technically the Super Nintendo was the more
5587740	5591820	advanced system but technically the Genesis did have
5591820	5597180	faster processing so Sega made sure that's what they focused on
5597180	5601980	and it worked. Still even if Nintendo didn't have blast
5601980	5605020	processing there was something they did have
5605020	5612700	which some might even say is more important. Games. The Legend of Zelda
5612700	5616300	a link to the past released in America in 1992
5616300	5620620	and did for Zelda what Super Mario Bros 3 did for Mario.
5620620	5625020	As a near perfect sequel and one of the best games of the 16-bit era
5625020	5629340	a link to the past expanded the overworld, expanded links moveset,
5629340	5632860	expanded the dungeon design and then added an entire
5632860	5636460	parallel dark world for the player to travel between that was similar and
5636460	5639500	yet completely different to the world they knew.
5639500	5643260	The result was a landmark action adventure game that set a standard for
5643260	5650140	2D Zelda still not surpassed to this day and Nintendo didn't stop there.
5650140	5654300	Sequels were expected but Nintendo had new ideas too
5654300	5658220	and they still had one of the best people around for the job.
5658220	5662300	Shigeru Miyamoto worked on several of the Super Nintendo's early first party
5662300	5666140	titles including the new futuristic racing game F-Zero
5666140	5669900	and the technologically groundbreaking rail shooter Star Fox,
5669900	5672780	the first Nintendo game to feature polygonal graphics
5672780	5677820	through the use of an additional graphics chip included in the game's cartridge.
5677820	5682380	Released in early 93 Star Fox went on to become one of the console's best-selling
5682380	5685100	games although it was still surpassed by another new
5685100	5690300	Nintendo franchise, 1992's Super Mario Kart which
5690300	5693820	brought Mario and friends into the world of kart racing
5693820	5697660	kicking off their own subgenre in the process.
5697660	5701740	Still Nintendo weren't the only one making good games.
5701820	5705260	Sega may have courted many third-party publishers but some of the most
5705260	5710700	important stayed loyal to Nintendo and brought a number of impressive sequels with them.
5710700	5714140	Square released Final Fantasy 4 known then as 2
5714140	5719020	outside Japan, Enix released Dragon Quest V which sold millions of copies
5719020	5723820	even as a Japan-only title, Konami released Super Castlevania 4
5723820	5726940	allowing players to once more take the fight to Dracula
5726940	5732540	but most important of all was Capcom who were at the time holding the rights to
5732540	5736300	the hottest game in the world, Street Fighter 2.
5736300	5739660	And while this game would eventually find its way to both systems
5739660	5743580	it still came to the Super NES first giving Nintendo
5743580	5747660	a head start of more than a year on what would go on to be the best-selling
5747660	5753020	third-party title of the generation and with Street Fighter
5753020	5759420	Nintendo had the edge they needed. Holiday season 1992 and this time Nintendo
5759420	5762620	was selling more systems allowing them to climb back into first
5762620	5767660	place in 93. Sega weren't done yet though and the
5767660	5772860	battle was about to get even messier. Wasting no time after the success of
5772860	5777020	their new best-selling game of all time Sega released the sequel to Sonic in late
5777020	5780940	92 featuring even faster gameplay alongside
5780940	5786700	reoccurring series Sidekick Tales but it was their more adult titles that
5786700	5792700	would truly define the next year. Two major features of this era of console
5792700	5796940	warfare were the idea that Sega had the more mature system and games
5796940	5801740	than the family-friendly Nintendo and debates over which version of specific
5801740	5805900	games were better. These days exclusives are what people
5805900	5809340	most remember but plenty of titles came to both systems
5809340	5813340	sometimes with completely different variants kicking off endless arguments
5813340	5817340	between fans over which system had the superior version
5817340	5821500	Contra 3 Alien Wars vs Contra Hardcore
5821500	5825100	Super Castlevania vs Castlevania Bloodlines
5825100	5830060	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in Time vs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
5830060	5836060	The Hyperstone Heist and on it went. Sometimes two competing titles would be
5836060	5839100	pretty much identical but there were other times when there were big
5839100	5844860	differences and clear winners and losers. For example with Street Fighter 2
5844860	5849100	the Super Nintendo was king with not only a year head start but also a more
5849100	5853500	suitable controller that had four face buttons alongside two shoulder buttons
5853500	5857900	compared to just three face buttons on the original Genesis controller.
5857900	5862780	Other times though the Genesis reigned supreme like with 1993's Aladdin
5862780	5866380	where the Genesis version was aided by real Disney animators
5866380	5870540	and went on to be one of the system's best-selling games.
5870540	5875020	And then there was Mortal Kombat a game which combined
5875020	5880060	arguments over Sega's more adult nature and arguments over which system had the
5880060	5884540	superior version and ended with Sega and Nintendo
5884540	5888220	sitting in front of a US congressional hearing on the dangers
5888220	5890780	of violence in video games.
5890780	5897100	Violence and violent images permeate more and more aspects of our lives
5897100	5901420	and I think it's time to draw the line. I know that one place
5901420	5907580	parents want us to draw the line is with violence in video games. The fact is that
5907580	5912300	a new generation of video games crosses that line containing the most
5912300	5916220	horrible depictions of graphic violence and sex
5916300	5919180	including particularly violence against women.
5919180	5924220	You see much like Street Fighter before it Mortal Kombat was a big success
5924220	5929420	but its graphic depictions of violence and brutal post-victory fatalities
5929420	5934140	attracted more attention than from just players kicking off a media frenzy
5934140	5938860	and national conversation on the role of violence in video games.
5938860	5942220	When Mortal Kombat made its way from arcades to consoles
5942220	5946060	Nintendo opted to tone down the violence by removing the blood effects
5946060	5949980	but Sega instead left them in as an unlockable option
5949980	5953420	making the Genesis version the most desirable.
5953420	5956060	Knowing that controversy might be on its way
5956060	5960220	Sega created their own internal rating system ahead of Mortal Kombat's console
5960220	5963180	release but this didn't prove to be enough
5963180	5967820	and by the end of 1993 the national conversation on video game violence
5967820	5971980	had reached US Congress with both Sega and Nintendo
5971980	5975420	being called up to answer some difficult questions.
5975420	5978780	A number of advocacy groups and senators spoke on the issue
5978780	5982860	presenting a united front while focusing heavily on Mortal Kombat
5982860	5986780	and the strange Sega CD-FMB game Night Trap
5986780	5990300	and claiming that there had been a systemic failure of the gaming industry
5990300	5995500	to police itself. When it came to those speaking in favor of the gaming industry
5995500	5999260	however those present were anything but united
5999260	6001980	with Nintendo getting the chance to speak first
6001980	6007740	and wasting no time in putting the blame squarely on Sega's lack of internal policy.
6007740	6012700	In the past years some very violent and offensive games have reached the market
6012700	6016300	and of course I'm speaking about Mortal Kombat and Night Trap
6016300	6021260	and let me say that for the record I want to state that Night Trap will never
6021260	6026700	appear on a Nintendo system. Obviously it would not pass our guidelines.
6026700	6032940	This game which as you've indicated promotes violence against women
6032940	6037420	simply has no place in our society. Meanwhile Sega began by defending
6037420	6041260	itself in the way that Sega fans at the time defended their favorite gaming
6041260	6046140	system on school playgrounds i.e. by reminding those in attendance
6046140	6050700	that the Genesis unlike its competition wasn't made for kids.
6050700	6054620	In recent days the glare of the media spotlight on this issue
6054620	6059900	has resulted in the circulation of a number of distorted and inaccurate claims.
6059900	6062860	The most damaging of these distortions in my view
6062860	6067900	is the notion that Sega are only in the business of selling games to children.
6067900	6072220	This is not the case. Sega also highlighted their new rating system
6072220	6076380	but this received a lot of pushback including from Nintendo's representative
6076380	6079500	who seemed much more interested in attacking Sega
6079500	6083340	than defending the gaming industry. Let me make it just a couple of other
6083340	6087420	points. I can't sit here and allow you to be told
6087420	6091980	that somehow the video game business has been transformed today
6091980	6096860	from children to adults. It hasn't been and Mr. White who is a former Nintendo
6096860	6099900	employee knows the demographics as well as I do.
6099900	6104620	Furthermore I can't let you sit here and by this nonsense that this
6104620	6109900	Sega Night Trap game was somehow only meant for adults. The fact of the
6109900	6113420	matter is this is a copy of the packaging.
6113420	6117660	There was no rating on this game at all when the game was introduced.
6117660	6121900	Small children bought this at Toys R Us and he knows that as well as I do.
6121900	6125660	Ultimately the senators seemed unimpressed by gaming's great console war
6125660	6129660	and decided to treat Sega and Nintendo in much the same way that a teacher
6129660	6134700	might treat two squabbling children. By giving them both a slap on the wrist
6134700	6139180	and telling them they better start working together to make things right.
6139180	6143420	So gaming's fiercest rivals came together with other representatives from
6143420	6146540	the industry to create the Interactive Digital
6146540	6149900	Software Association which soon led to the creation of the
6149900	6155900	Entertainment Software Rating Board or ESRB who would produce a unified set of
6155900	6159820	age ratings for all commercial video games that retailers would then opt into
6159820	6162380	enforcing. Something that has since become common
6162380	6166140	practice across many different regions.
6166140	6169500	In the congressional hearing Sega came under the heaviest attack
6169500	6173020	and following public outcry many retailers pulled the controversial
6173020	6178140	night trap from their shelves. However when it came to actual video game
6178140	6182460	players this didn't seem to damage Sega's reputation at all
6182460	6188700	and instead helped cement their status as the cooler more mature gaming company
6188700	6195740	ultimately leading to sales going up. Holiday season 1993 and Sega came out
6195740	6202220	on top retaking the overall lead in 94 with 55 percent of the market.
6202220	6207020	By 1994 Sega and Nintendo weren't the only ones dealing with controversy
6207020	6210220	though as in the world of the personal computer
6210220	6213740	another violent video game was exploding in popularity
6213740	6218460	and leaving its own mark on gaming history.
6219020	6225980	In the early 90s consoles might have received the most attention
6225980	6229420	and made the most money but PC was still the place to be
6229420	6233420	the innovation and it saw a number of big releases of its own.
6233420	6237660	LucasArts 1990 pirate themed The Secret of Monkey Island
6237660	6241180	set a new standard for the graphical adventure genre with its user-friendly
6241180	6245740	interface sharp comedic writing and a more open game design but removed any
6245740	6249500	sort of fail state and ensured players could never be locked out of puzzles or
6249500	6253900	the means to progress the game. In 1991 Sidmir's
6253900	6257980	civilization popularized the 4x genre of strategy games
6257980	6263340	where you explored expanded exploited and exterminated your opposition
6263340	6267500	while guiding a human civilization over the course of several millennia
6267500	6270700	a concept that proved as expansive and original
6270700	6275340	as it was addictive. Delphine software's strikingly cinematic
6275340	6278540	action adventure game Another World also released that year
6278540	6281740	leaving a lasting impression on many who played it.
6281740	6285500	Featuring a scientist fighting for survival on an alien planet
6285500	6288940	it placed a heavy emphasis on presentation and told its story
6288940	6293100	entirely without dialogue creating a game that felt years ahead of its time
6293100	6296300	and would influence a number of important future titles including
6296300	6303020	Ico, Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill. In 1992 Westwood Studios created the
6303020	6307740	first real-time strategy game with Dune 2 combining resource gathering
6307740	6312780	base building and small-scale warfare into an addictive new formula.
6312780	6316700	Dune 2 would be followed by Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft Orcs and
6316700	6320380	Humans in 1994 and Westwood's Alternative History
6320380	6325180	Command and Conquer in 1995 which together established the RTS as an
6325180	6329980	important genre within gaming. 92 also saw the birth of the survival
6329980	6333580	horror genre with infograms alone in the dark.
6333580	6336780	A game that went beyond embracing horror as an aesthetic
6336780	6339980	by deliberately disempowering the player to heighten the tension
6339980	6344860	and create a sense of dread. Its haunted mansion setting and cinematic
6344860	6349740	camera would also greatly influence future titles of the genre.
6349740	6353900	Meanwhile in the world of role-playing games the Ultima series continued strongly
6353900	6357740	with its highly acclaimed seventh entry The Black Gate
6357740	6361260	but it was a spin-off from the main series that proved to be the most
6361260	6366300	innovative RPG that year. Looking Glass Studios Ultima Underworld
6366300	6370060	was the first role-playing game to feature first-person action in a 3D
6370060	6374060	environment. Described as a dungeon simulation by its
6374060	6376780	creators, Ultima Underworld combined the dungeon
6376780	6380540	crawling of genre grandfathers like Wizardry with cutting-edge action
6380540	6384540	gameplay and environmental design to create a brand new type of action
6384540	6388780	RPG that would pave the way for the immersive sim genre and many future
6388780	6393180	titles. 1993 also saw the release of the visually
6393180	6396780	stunning graphic adventure game Mist from Cyan Inc.
6396780	6400620	which took full advantage of the vastly expanded storage capacity
6400620	6406300	of Benoo CD-ROM to create its iconic picturesque 3D island while helping to
6406300	6410860	popularize the adoption of CD drivers in the process.
6410860	6415900	Mist's puzzle-solving gameplay was quite slow but its graphics were far beyond
6415900	6419580	anything else at the time leading it to become one of the best-selling PC
6419580	6425740	games of all time. Finally in 1994, Mythos Games sci-fi
6425740	6429820	strategy game XCOM UFO Defense combined turn-based tactical
6429820	6433740	battles with real-time management to create a surprisingly deep
6433740	6437900	earth defense simulation unlike any other game before it.
6437900	6441500	While Origin System's ambitious latest entry into the Space Combat
6441500	6445580	Wing Commander series included extensive live action FMV cutscenes
6445580	6449820	that featured big Hollywood names like Mark Hamill and Malcolm McDowell
6449820	6454220	represent in a major step of PC gaming towards the mainstream.
6454220	6458220	Still as important as each of these games were none of them are what the early
6458220	6462540	90s are best remembered for. For that we need to go back to the start
6462540	6465260	of the decade where a small group of 20-something year old
6465260	6469500	developers were working for software company Softisk in an office
6469500	6473420	in Shreveport, Louisiana. It was here that 20-year-old
6473420	6477340	university dropout John Carmack was thinking about a well-known problem
6477340	6482060	in PC game development. How to achieve side-scrolling graphics
6482060	6486300	on a computer. You see while computers were powerful
6486300	6489500	in certain ways they weren't designed specifically for gaming
6489500	6492780	meaning there were some things consoles were just better at
6492780	6498300	like allowing for faster refresh rates. This meant PC struggled to redraw an
6498300	6502780	entire screen at the same speed as a console making the iconic side-scrolling
6502780	6505420	seen in so many of the most popular video games
6505420	6512460	impossible until Carmack had an idea why redraw everything on screen
6512460	6517260	when you could instead only redraw the parts that actually change.
6517260	6521340	This became known as adaptive tile refresh and with it
6521340	6525900	Carmack was about to change the world of PC gaming.
6525900	6529260	First Carmack and friends recreated Super Mario Bros 3
6529260	6532460	step by step something people thought couldn't be done
6532460	6536140	on PC. They then sent the end result to Nintendo
6536140	6540380	who were admittedly impressed but told them they didn't want Nintendo games
6540380	6544620	on anything except Nintendo hardware meaning all their hard work
6544700	6549900	had been for nothing. So next they decided to make their own
6549900	6553740	game instead. With no corporate backing or funding
6553740	6557180	they decided to team up with shareware distributor Apogee Software
6557180	6561580	to create the side-scrolling platformer Commander Keen.
6561580	6565740	It was completed in just a few months and saw great success through the shareware
6565740	6569260	model. Then once the first royalty check arrived
6569260	6573420	John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack and Tom Hall
6573420	6577500	decided to quit their jobs at Softisk to found their own company
6577500	6581500	id Software. Carmack soon turned his attention to
6581500	6585740	gaming's new frontier 3D and once more encountered a similar
6585740	6588700	problem to before which was that computers of the time
6588700	6593660	were just too slow to allow for fast action in 3D environments.
6593660	6597020	id Software continued to create more shareware distributor games
6597020	6601580	while experimenting with 3D which allowed Carmack to iterate on his new 3D
6601580	6604780	engine by restricting the viewpoint to increase speed
6604780	6609260	using sprites and texture mapping to save space and so on.
6609260	6615660	The end result was Wolfenstein 3D which released in summer 1992 and allowed
6615660	6618860	players to mow down hordes of Nazis from a first person
6618860	6624620	perspective in 3D environments. Wolfenstein was the first true first
6624620	6628460	person shooter and its fast pace and smooth action
6628460	6632380	made it hugely successful but it would soon be overshadowed
6632380	6636780	by an even more impressive game.
6638940	6645100	Released in late 1993 Doom was a game which changed gaming.
6645100	6649340	Bigger, faster and more violent than Wolfenstein with visuals that looked years
6649340	6653500	ahead of its predecessor Doom was an instant classic.
6653500	6658300	For years there was no FPS genre there were only Doom clones.
6658300	6661580	It invented the deathmatch while helping to pioneer the concept of networked
6661580	6664300	multiplayer. It spawned one of the most active mod
6664300	6667980	scenes of all time while greatly popularizing the concept of modding
6667980	6673100	and it was estimated that by late 1995 it was installed on more computers
6673100	6678140	worldwide than Microsoft's latest Windows operating system.
6678140	6682300	Doom was a gaming phenomenon and it only achieved that level of success
6682300	6686780	because underneath its demon-infested exterior and innovative technology
6686780	6691180	was a really well made game that used fast action
6691180	6694780	varied enemy encounters and complex level design full of secrets
6694780	6699100	to create a formula that still holds up all these years later.
6699100	6702940	Doom also served as a perfect representation of what made PC gaming
6702940	6707820	so different to consoles in the early 90s. While Sega was desperately trying to
6707820	6711020	market itself as the mature alternative to Nintendo
6711020	6714540	games like Doom were providing a genuine mature alternative
6714540	6719020	without even really meaning to and while consoles were embroiled in a clash
6719020	6722940	of corporate giants and spending tens of millions on marketing every year
6722940	6726380	Doom was self-published, distributed through shareware
6726380	6730620	and made by initially just five guys with two more coming on to help near the
6730620	6734380	end. And despite this humble background
6734380	6739020	it was still the most impressive 3d game the industry had ever seen
6739020	6742940	and it helped to create the most successful genre in gaming.
6742940	6746380	There have been independent games that have been phenomenally successful since
6746380	6749900	Doom but it is truly rare for an independent game
6749900	6753340	to be so successful while also being technologically
6753340	6757260	years ahead of its competition. The shareware distribution model can
6757260	6760940	also be seen as a forerunner to digital distribution.
6760940	6764860	It worked by offering part of the game as a free trial that anyone could download
6764860	6769100	and play and then asking players to pay to purchase the rest.
6769100	6773740	With no retailer or possibly publisher it meant games sold this way had much more
6773740	6776620	limited reach but the lack of any middlemen also
6776620	6781900	meant lower prices for consumers and a larger cut of revenue for the developer.
6781900	6785820	And so it should come as no surprise then but Doom's success
6785820	6789420	quickly turned its creators into multi-millionaires.
6789420	6792860	Six months after Doom's release John Carmack owned two
6792860	6797500	Ferraris. He was 23 years old at the time.
6797580	6801260	Its software would follow Doom with a sequel in 1994
6801260	6805180	before creating an even more powerful engine to reduce their fully 3d Doom
6805180	6809900	successor Quake in 1996 which took multiplayer to
6809900	6813900	soaring new heights with far more modes and built in 16 player
6813900	6818540	online capability. Quake was another big hit and with it
6818540	6822700	the era of online first-person shooter domination had arrived.
6822700	6827100	But for consoles the mid 90s would also bring the next generation of systems
6827180	6832780	and it didn't exactly play out as most people expected.
6837420	6842460	1994 was a big year for the gaming industry but its start was still dominated
6842460	6846380	by the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo and the fallout from the
6846380	6851020	violent video game debate. Sega had now edged back into the lead
6851020	6854860	and this period would see several of the Genesis best exclusive titles
6854860	6857740	such as the beat em up classic Streets of Rage 2,
6857740	6860620	the side-scrolling platformer Rocket Knight Adventure
6860620	6864940	and the action-packed running and gunning Gunstar Heroes.
6864940	6869420	1994 would also see the release of not one but two new entries into Sega's
6869420	6873420	hottest series after Sonic 3 became so large during development
6873420	6877100	that it could no longer fit into a single cartridge causing it to be split
6877100	6881660	into Sonic 3 and the separate Sonic and Knuckles.
6881660	6887740	Nintendo had plenty of games of their own however. 1993's Super Mario All-Stars
6887740	6892860	remade the first three entries into the Super Mario Bros series with Super Nintendo level graphics
6892860	6896460	and is noticeable as not only one of the system's best-selling titles
6896460	6900460	but also one of the first examples of a massively successful video game remake.
6901900	6906540	In 1994 Nintendo would raise one of the Super Nintendo's most highly acclaimed titles with
6906540	6910140	Super Metroid which upgraded the formula of the original game
6910140	6913980	while retaining its rich sci-fi atmosphere and focus on exploration.
6914860	6919340	Still, Nintendo's biggest game that year came at the hands of another developer.
6920220	6924460	Due to concerns about falling behind Sega, Nintendo began looking for other studios
6924460	6928620	to bring on board, leading them to approach the UK-based Studio Rare
6928620	6931980	who had impressed them with their latest 3D model rendering technology.
6933020	6937020	Nintendo suggested they use these pre-rendered graphics to make a platformer
6937020	6940860	and gave them permission to use one of their oldest IPs to do it.
6941180	6970140	Even before Donkey Kong Country released in late 1994,
6970140	6972940	its unique visual style brought it a lot of attention
6972940	6976540	and convinced Nintendo to heavily back it with a generous marketing campaign.
6977580	6983180	Even so, the game still exceeded expectations, setting the record for the fastest-selling game
6983180	6986940	of all time and going on to become the third best-selling game on the system.
6988060	6993420	It also wowed critics, impressing with its creative level design and timeless soundtrack
6993420	6995100	in addition to the striking visuals.
6996060	7000460	Donkey Kong Country was the edge Nintendo needed to pull back into the lead
7000460	7005660	following a strong holiday season in 1994, but while high-quality new titles
7005660	7008380	ensured the Super Nintendo was still going strong,
7008380	7012460	by this point Sega was starting to turn their attention to future systems.
7013660	7017340	The fifth console generation started early and saw heavy competition.
7018140	7023580	The 3DO released in America in late 1993 and boasted some seriously impressive technical
7023660	7028620	specifications, becoming the first system to fully take advantage of new CD-ROM technology.
7029580	7037980	It also launched with a retail price of $700, which is $1,400 after inflation and struggled
7037980	7043020	to build a library of solid exclusives, meaning it ultimately struggled to compete with later,
7043020	7045660	better-known systems despite its strong launch.
7046940	7052940	And as for those later systems, two would go head-to-head in Japan in late 1994,
7053580	7056540	but this time, Nintendo wouldn't be one of them.
7057660	7062220	Sega began work on the next system early after realizing the importance of CD-ROMs
7062220	7065420	and having had promising results with 3D technology in arcades.
7066380	7071260	At the same time as this, they tried to maintain support for the Genesis by creating a second add-on
7071260	7077500	in addition to the Sega CD called the 32X that would bridge the gap between the two generations
7077500	7080300	and offer a cheaper entry into the 32-bit era.
7081260	7086380	Unfortunately, Sega struggled to produce enough games for either the Sega CD or the 32X to
7086380	7091660	really justify their high costs, meaning both pieces of hardware ended up as commercial failures
7091660	7096140	and might have damaged Sega's reputation with fans who did buy these add-ons due to their
7096140	7102140	perceived lack of support. Still, it was the next generation where the battle would truly be decided
7102140	7107260	and so Sega went all out on developing a new system that could meet their lofty expectations.
7107580	7112220	While Sega was working on a 32-bit system of their own, however, a new entrant into the
7112220	7117500	video game scene was doing the same and getting ready to change the console landscape forever more.
7118780	7123580	Sony was an electronics company founded after World War II and best known for their music
7123580	7129900	products like the Sony Walkman. Their first foray into gaming hadn't turned out very well.
7130540	7135340	A joint venture with Nintendo led to them producing the sound chip used in the Super Nintendo,
7135660	7142140	but they also worked with Nintendo on a CD-ROM add-on for the system. Before it could be completed,
7142140	7147580	however, Nintendo got cold feet over how much control the terms of the deal gave Sony and instead
7147580	7154300	went to negotiate a more favorable deal with Sony's main rival, Philips. Not knowing this,
7154300	7159980	Sony went on to announce their Super Nintendo add-on at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1991.
7160940	7166860	It was called the PlayStation, and the very next day, Nintendo got up on stage themselves
7166860	7172540	and announced their new partnership with Philips, declaring the PlayStation dead in the process.
7174060	7178860	For Sony, this was a serious blow and an even more serious betrayal,
7178860	7182300	something not taken lightly in Japan's honor-based business culture.
7183420	7187820	They responded by severing all ties with Nintendo, with many executives at Sony wanting
7187820	7192140	to end all activity connected to the gaming industry, which they had come to view as too
7192140	7197180	close to the toy industry to fit with Sony's established brand, in addition to being apparently
7197180	7203180	highly unreliable. Ken Kutaragi, the man in charge of the PlayStation's development,
7203180	7209340	wanted the opposite, however. Kutaragi was confident in his technology and proposed Sony
7209340	7214060	go it alone and create a standalone console, while using the company's poor treatment from
7214060	7217820	Nintendo to support his argument for why they shouldn't give up on the idea.
7219100	7225980	In the end, Kutaragi got his way, but he still had a problem. Not only was developing their own
7225980	7231020	system considerably risky, but Sony also had no actual experience in game development.
7232140	7237020	In the past, consoles had lived and died on the strength of their first party support,
7237020	7242940	which for Sony didn't even exist. So, not knowing anything about game development,
7243020	7247420	the team decided to stick with what they did know, hardware and business.
7248620	7253660	To this end, they designed the system from the ground up with a focus on 3D polygon graphics
7253660	7257100	and also set out to secure their desperately needed third party support.
7258380	7262540	To do this, they formed partnerships with established Japanese developers like Namco and
7262540	7268140	Konami, while purchasing the UK-based Cygnosis, who were best known for their widely popular puzzle
7268140	7275180	game Lemmings. This gave Sony their first in-house team, and it was through this that they would
7275180	7281100	stumble into their big break. Developers at Cygnosis found the current workstation-based
7281100	7286460	development kits to be overly expensive and impractical, and so they persuaded Sony to
7286460	7291740	instead use a PC-based development system, thus marking a major turning point for the
7292060	7295420	console industry, which had largely ignored PCs until then.
7296700	7302300	PC-based development was not only cheaper and more efficient, it also streamlined the process
7302300	7308300	for third parties, while making porting games between PC and Sony's new system much easier
7308300	7314140	than before, something which proved crucial in allowing Sony to compete with their more established
7314140	7320060	rivals. As the console neared completion, Sony decided to break from the tradition of using
7320140	7324460	the company's name in the title of the system due to upper management's fear that failure could
7324460	7331980	damage the company's brand, and so the console would keep its original name. And in December 1994,
7331980	7337580	the PlayStation launched in Japan, just one week after release of another new console,
7337580	7339100	the Sega Saturn.
7339420	7368140	The two systems were similarly priced,
7368140	7372700	and offered similar performance, but it was Sega who proved to be the early favorite,
7372700	7377500	thanks in large part to the hugely popular Virtua Fighter, which sold at a near one-to-one
7377500	7383820	ratio with the Saturn at release. For the PlayStation, it was Sega's big arcade rival Namco
7383820	7388380	that would be the console's most important developer in its first year, with Ridge Racer
7388380	7393020	proving the most successful launch title and Tekken soon following to give the PlayStation
7393020	7399260	a 3D fighting game of its own. Still, exclusives wouldn't be the most important factor in the
7399260	7405900	new system's first years. As both systems prepared for their global release, both companies came up
7405900	7411180	with a plan to give them the edge over the other, which they would reveal at the first-ever Electronic
7411180	7418220	Entertainment Expo in 1995, where 40,000 eager attendees packed the Los Angeles Convention Center
7418300	7424540	to get a glimpse of the next generation of gaming. Sega went first and took to the stage
7424540	7431100	to announce that, due to high consumer demand, the Saturn would release immediately, that very day,
7431100	7436700	at select retailers. This was four months before the expected September release date,
7436700	7442540	and Sega hoped this headstart would give them the advantage. Unfortunately for them, however,
7442540	7447100	other retailers responded to this surprise announcement very negatively, with KB toys
7447100	7452460	even dropping Sega from its lineup, and the early release also left the Saturn's launch lineup
7452460	7459020	rather light on games. Things quickly went from bad to worse, though, because Sony followed with
7459020	7464780	a surprise announcement of their own, which came when SCE President of America, Steve Race, took
7464780	7468940	to the stage to give one of gaming's all-time greatest speeches.
7495100	7506540	$299 was $100 less than the Saturn, meaning the systems were no longer similarly priced,
7507100	7511820	and it turned out that while Sega's gamble backfired, Sony's instead paid off.
7512860	7519500	The PlayStation released on the 9th of September 1995. Two days later, it had sold more units than
7519500	7525420	the Saturn had in the last four months. The PlayStation's launch was huge, and what's more,
7525420	7530380	their easier-to-develop for system was about to start proving its worth, as a number of former
7530380	7537180	PC developers soon started releasing games for Sony's new console. Notable examples include
7537180	7543660	Platformer Rayman from Ubisoft in 95, Naughty Dog's soon-to-be-iconic Crash Bandicoot in 96,
7543660	7548380	which gave the PlayStation its first real mascot, and Tomb Raider from Core Design,
7548460	7552940	a graphically impressive action-adventure game featuring one of gaming's most recognisable
7552940	7560060	female leads. 96 also saw the release of another landmark PlayStation title from Capcom with
7560060	7565020	Resident Evil, which may be the single most influential survival horror game of all time.
7566220	7570460	All of these titles were big commercial hits, with Resident Evil, Crash Bandicoot,
7570460	7573980	and Tomb Raider each going on to sell over 5 million copies.
7574060	7580300	The Saturn did have games of its own, with several high-quality arcade ports, alongside some strong
7580300	7587100	new first-party titles like Night's Into Dreams and Panzer Jagoons. Sony, however, increasingly
7587100	7592300	seemed to have the rest of the gaming industry on their side, and in time, Sony's initial victory
7592300	7598060	would turn into a slaughter. For years, Sega tried to set themselves apart from Nintendo
7598060	7603180	by appealing to an older demographic and marketing their system as the more mature option,
7603180	7607420	but now Sony was doing the same, and beating Sega at their own game.
7608620	7613660	In 96, Sega responded to the growing pressure with the release of the Saturn Model 2,
7613660	7618780	which aimed to lower the retail price and cost of manufacturing. Sony, however,
7618780	7625740	replied by cutting the price of the PlayStation to $199, ensuring their lead just kept growing.
7627020	7631980	For Sega, the situation was starting to look desperate, and the competition would only increase
7631980	7635660	as an old friend of theirs would soon release a console of their own.
7637180	7641900	While the fifth console generation was getting off to an explosive start, Nintendo were quietly
7641900	7647260	enjoying the Super Nintendo's finest years. After a drawn-out and tightly fought competition
7647260	7652220	with the Genesis, where Sega had often come out on top, in its later years, the supply of
7652220	7658140	new Genesis games slowed up, allowing Nintendo to finally pull comfortably ahead in a 16-bit market
7658140	7664940	that was still going surprisingly strong. This may have been partly because 1995-96
7664940	7671100	saw some of the Super Nintendo's best games. Super Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island, saw Mario
7671100	7677100	return with a stunning new art style and fresh Yoshi-focused gameplay. Rare followed up the
7677100	7683100	monstrously successful Donkey Kong Country with not one, but two more sequels that almost matched
7683100	7688940	the first in sales. And RPG fans were spoiled for choice, with the cult classic Earthbound's
7688940	7694220	idiosyncratic take on modern America offering a setting unlike anything players had seen before,
7694940	7700140	Square and Nintendo's collaborative Super Mario RPG offering a Mario game unlike anything
7700140	7706140	players had seen before, and Final Fantasy's latest entry, 6 or 3 depending on region,
7706140	7709980	providing the series' highest rated and best-selling title to date.
7710940	7715820	Lastly, there was also Chrono Trigger, which was developed by a dream team that included
7715820	7720620	the creator of the Final Fantasy series, the creator of the Dragon Quest series, and the creator of
7720620	7726300	the Dragon Ball Manga. Chrono Trigger featured a time-travelling adventure with multiple endings,
7726300	7732380	lots of reactivity, and some of the best visuals and music of a 16-bit era, and it's often considered
7732380	7739180	to be one of the best JRPGs of all time. Still, as strong as the Super Nintendo's last years were,
7739260	7744060	nothing can last forever, at least not in the always-evolving gaming industry,
7744060	7749820	and development of Nintendo's next console started as far back as early 1993.
7750940	7756140	After their development of a CD-based system failed to work out with either Sony or Philips,
7756140	7760060	Nintendo formed a new partnership with Silicon Graphics to bring their powerful
7760060	7766940	supercomputer technology to the world of consoles. The final product released in 1996,
7766940	7775180	with the name Nintendo 64 to emphasize its 64 bits of computing. But as powerful as Nintendo's
7775180	7780860	new system might have been, it was about to face heavy competition, and its main rival had a head
7780860	7794300	start alongside one other key advantage. Nintendo arrived late, but the N64 did have some things
7794300	7799580	in its favor. Nintendo's continued focus on affordability meant the system was able to match
7799580	7804060	for new prices of Saturn and PlayStation, while offering much more powerful hardware.
7805100	7810300	We've doubled the PlayStation's RAM at three times faster CPU, and a much higher polygon count
7810300	7814540	that 3D graphics of the N64 were simply a step above any of their competitors.
7815500	7820060	Nintendo also innovated with their controller by adding a thumb-controlled analog stick,
7820140	7825900	reminiscent of the joysticks of older gaming systems. The overall design might seem clunky by
7825900	7830460	today's standards, but it was an important step for the time, and analog controls greatly
7830460	7836700	complemented the move to 3D. The N64 also came with four controller ports, which was two more
7836700	7842940	than its rivals, and made it a great system for multiplayer games. Nintendo's launch lineup
7842940	7848220	initially looked less promising, with only two games available for the North American release.
7849180	7855020	This lack of games was what delayed the release to 1996, and for most consoles, two titles would
7855020	7861180	never be enough. Luckily for Nintendo, however, one of those games was capable of doing some rather
7861180	7862380	heavy lifting.
7878460	7894460	Super Mario 64 didn't just bring Nintendo's popular mascot into the realm of 3D, it also
7894460	7899980	shattered expectations for what a 3D platformer could be. Before it, games of the genre had
7899980	7906780	used fixed cameras, or just suffered from loose, imprecise controls. But using the new analog stick,
7906780	7912460	Mario was given full 360-degree movement with a detached adjustable camera and a rich array of
7912460	7918620	movement options. Levels were big and inviting, begging players to explore and experiment,
7919180	7924300	and the cartoony visual style was a great fit for showcasing the N64's high polygon count.
7925500	7932060	Basically, it was as strong a launch title as Nintendo could have asked for, but it still
7932140	7939340	wouldn't be enough. Because as impressive as the N64 and Mario were, there was one thing the
7939340	7947580	PlayStation did, which Nintendo didn't. And that was used CDs. Nintendo's console was more
7947580	7954300	powerful. It did have a higher polygon count and shorter load times, but CDs had higher capacity,
7954300	7959980	and for many developers, this was the most important factor. The best known example of this
7959980	7965340	was RPG Veteran Square, who had been a loyal ally to Nintendo and had originally begun work on
7965340	7970940	their next Final Fantasy game on the Super Nintendo. As development progressed, Square soon
7970940	7975020	realised they wanted to use pre-rendered video and backgrounds, something that would only be
7975020	7979260	possible with the larger capacity of the CD, meaning creating the game for Nintendo's new
7979260	7985340	console was no longer possible. As development continued, Square invested more and more resources
7985340	7990140	into the project, resulting in an estimated development budget of more than $14 million,
7991340	7997420	making it the most expensive game ever made at the time, and it turned out, Square's investment
7997420	7999500	paid off.
8028060	8037420	Final Fantasy VII released in 1997, and was unbelievably successful. Its use of full-motion
8037420	8042780	video and pre-rendered CG gave it a cinematic style which wowed audiences and critics alike.
8043660	8048540	Its setting and characters felt fresh and exciting in an era years before anime had found
8048540	8053980	mainstream popularity, and when most Japanese RPGs still didn't even get released outside Japan,
8054700	8058540	and its story and sense of adventure resonated with players at the time
8058540	8064860	in a way that few other games ever had. Final Fantasy VII sold over 10 million copies,
8064860	8068460	eventually going on to become the PlayStation's joint best-selling game of all time.
8069500	8074780	For Sony, it was the PlayStation's killer app, and they didn't even need to do anything to get it.
8075900	8081260	The higher capacity of CDs allowed for the use of FMV, as well as higher quality sound,
8081340	8088300	and even more realistic and detailed textures. And so, the N64 was the more powerful system,
8088300	8094380	in all ways except for the one which mattered the most. Nintendo weren't out of the competition
8094380	8100140	yet though, because there was something they could do which Sony couldn't. Make their own games.
8101500	8106700	The N64 couldn't match the PlayStation's early sales, but it still got off to a solid start,
8106700	8111580	thanks in large part to Nintendo's strong pre-established reputation, and more games
8111580	8120780	were soon on the way. At the end of 1996, Mario 64 was joined by Mario Kart 64, bringing kart racing
8120780	8127180	to the third dimension, and giving the system its second best-selling game. In 97, Nintendo continued
8127180	8133580	venue naming convention with the well-received Star Fox 64, and gave Mario Sidekick Yoshi
8133580	8140300	his own standalone title with Yoshi's Story. They also received invaluable support from the then
8140300	8146460	second-party developer Rare, who were about to give the console one of the era's most iconic games.
8163660	8182460	Goldeneye 007 single-handedly proved that first-person shooters could work on consoles,
8182460	8188540	and they could work well. Taking inspiration from Doom, but opting for a more realistic approach,
8188540	8193100	Goldeneye featured a memorable single-player campaign that did an admirable job of providing a
8193100	8198860	James Bond-like experience, complete with a rich story, varied levels and stealth elements,
8198860	8204380	but it was multiplayer that the game is best remembered for. By bringing the fun of the
8204380	8209740	deathmatch to consoles, Goldeneye proved to be a massive success, and went on to sell over 8
8209740	8216380	million copies, putting it only behind Mario 64 and Mario Kart as the system's best-selling game.
8216780	8223420	And the hits from Rare didn't stop at Goldeneye. They also gave the system a second popular
8223420	8228220	kart racer with Diddy Kong Racing, before kicking off a new critically-acclaimed platforming series
8228220	8234700	with Banjo-Kazooie, before following this with Donkey Kong's successful 3D debut in Donkey Kong 64,
8234700	8240300	and finally by providing worthy successors to both Goldeneye and Banjo-Kazooie in 2000
8240300	8245900	with Perfect Dark and Banjo 2e. Nintendo also had more important games of their own,
8245980	8249820	with two in particular going on to help define the fifth console generation.
8250940	8255420	The first would see the return of Nintendo's other flagship series and produced what may be
8255420	8261260	the most critically-acclaimed game of all time. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
8261260	8267740	released in late 1998 and made the transition to 3D while retaining the series' focus on exploration
8267740	8274460	and adventure. With intuitive combat, intricate dungeon design and a huge world full of secrets,
8274540	8279580	Ocarina of Time was a staggeringly well-made game, but what truly elevated it to one of
8279580	8286540	gaming's all-time greats was its sense of atmosphere and weight. At times, dark, somber,
8286540	8291900	and even surreal, Link's quest to the feet Ganondorf felt as epic as it was enchanting,
8291900	8298380	in a way rarely matched in the medium before or since. Nintendo also gave the world a new take
8298380	8305580	on the fighting genre in 1999 with Super Smash Bros. Featuring an all-star cast of classic Nintendo
8305580	8310860	characters, Smash moved the focus away from character-specific combos to create a more
8310860	8315740	approachable but no less enjoyable fighting game that was unlike anything else on the market.
8317020	8321660	Still, as impressive as Nintendo's first and second-party titles were in this period,
8321660	8324540	they still weren't enough to match the PlayStation's ever-growing lineup.
8325500	8329420	With so many developers favouring Sony's system because of its ease of development
8329420	8334380	and the advantages of CDs, Nintendo was left with little third-party support,
8334380	8339500	and the more the PlayStation user base grew, the more developers wanted their games to be on it.
8340940	8345900	Sony finished the decades strongly. They took inspiration from Nintendo to produce
8345900	8351260	their own dual analog controller in 1997. They transitioned their marketing from targeting
8351260	8356060	Sega towards directly targeting Nintendo after Nintendo became the main competition,
8356620	8361180	and with each new year they saw multiple major titles but ensured the PlayStation's dominant
8361180	8368940	position grew and grew. 1997 brought well-received sequels to Tomb Raider and Crash Bandicoot,
8368940	8373500	alongside the only other game that could match Final Fantasy and Sales numbers, Gran Turismo.
8374380	8379420	Produced by Polyphony Digital, a new Japanese-based first-party studio within Sony,
8379420	8384540	Gran Turismo received universal acclaim and set a new bar for graphics and realism in a driving
8384540	8389740	game, surpassing even arcade competition in a somewhat symbolic step for the industry.
8391100	8397980	In 1998, Sony's lineup was arguably even stronger, with widely successful sequels to Resident Evil,
8397980	8403340	Tekken, Crash Bandicoot and Tomb Raider that would be joined by high-selling new series,
8403340	8408860	like Insomniac's Spiroba Dragon. Perhaps the year's biggest surprise came from
8408860	8414300	another ex-Nintendo ally when Konami released their latest entry into the Metal Gear series.
8415660	8420860	Much like Final Fantasy VII before it, Metal Gear Solid wowed players with its cinematic focus,
8421420	8427100	this time produced through in-engine cutscenes, alongside full voice acting and an unusually
8427100	8433180	mature and complicated storyline. The result was one of the most story-focused and cinematic
8433180	8440300	experiences ever seen in a game, and it too would receive universal acclaim alongside 7 million copies
8440300	8448460	sold. 1999 was once more a packed year with even more sequels, this time to Final Fantasy,
8448460	8455180	Resident Evil, Spiro, Tomb Raider and Gran Turismo, alongside a new survival horror game from Konami
8455180	8460700	in Silent Hill and a kart racer to compete with Nintendo in the form of Crash Team Racing.
8461660	8467020	As the console generation progressed, the reality of the situation became clear. Sony's lineup of
8467020	8471500	games was simply too strong, and it allowed the PlayStation to maintain the dominant lead on
8471500	8477900	its competition from its release all the way to its discontinuation 12 years later. In the process,
8477900	8483340	the PlayStation became the first console in history to surpass 100 million units sold,
8483340	8487580	which was more than twice that of the previous generation's leader, the Super Nintendo,
8487660	8495500	and almost 70 million more than Sony's closest competition, the N64. By contrast, the Saturn
8495500	8503500	sold only 9.2 million, leaving Sega a distant third place and in serious trouble. During this
8503500	8507980	period, disagreements over the company's future between the Japanese and American divisions were
8507980	8513580	reported to be frequent. Ultimately, the rapidly declining profits led the company to discontinue
8513660	8519260	the Saturn in 1998 in favour of focusing on the next generation, where they hoped to get a head
8519260	8524620	start on the competition. Throughout the development of their next console, Sega tried to learn from
8524620	8529500	their mistakes with the Saturn by paying close attention to production costs and trying to select
8529500	8536060	hardware components similar to personal computers to assist software development. The system also
8536060	8541020	used a custom version of Windows operating system to further help with porting games between PC
8541580	8547100	and was the first console to include a built-in modular modem to enable internet access and
8547100	8553580	online play. In the end, the console was completed while the fifth generation was still going strong,
8553580	8559420	and in November 1998, it released in Japan, with a global release coming one year later.
8571180	8593020	The Dreamcast got off to a slow but steady start. Pre-orders in Japan were high,
8593020	8597500	but hardware shortages meant Sega couldn't keep up with demand, meaning they failed to meet their
8597500	8603180	initial sales goals. The American launch went smoother, however, and the first year sales seemed
8603180	8609180	promising. The launch lineup included a number of first-party titles, but its two big early stars
8609180	8616380	would be Sonic Adventures and Soul Calibur. The first represented Sonic's first true 3D debut
8616380	8620540	and quickly became the system's best-selling game, while Namco's Soul Calibur was one of the
8620540	8625580	most highly acclaimed fighting games of all time and is notable as being graphically superior to
8625660	8632460	its arcade counterpart and showcasing just how much next-gen systems could do. Still,
8632460	8636940	early sales were one thing, but the true test for Sega would be when their competition joined the
8636940	8643820	sixth generation, and for that, they wouldn't need to wait long. And so, the decade came to a
8643820	8649820	close where after years of intense neck-and-neck battle between Sega and Nintendo, it was Sony
8649820	8657100	who ultimately came out as the winner, and they won by some way. For Nintendo, the end of the 90s
8657100	8662300	weren't all bad, however, because there was one area where they remained firmly on top.
8668780	8674300	The Game Boy released in 1989 and quickly surpassed its technologically superior competition.
8675420	8679580	Nintendo supported their new handheld system with a number of first-party continuations of
8679660	8687020	classic Nintendo series. This meant more Mario, with Super Mario Land 2 before new series antagonist
8687020	8694300	Wario got his first game in Wario Land Super Mario Land 3. The Game Boy also got a sequel to Metroid,
8694300	8699580	with Metroid 2 Return of Samus, as well as a new 2D Zelda with Link's Awakening.
8700540	8706460	Other notable early Game Boy games include Puzzle Game Dr. Mario, Kirby's First Ever Outing in
8706460	8711980	Kirby's Dreamland, and a continuation of the original Donkey Kong series, as well as a portable
8711980	8718540	title from Rare called Donkey Kong Land. These games were all well received and helped the Game Boy
8718540	8724460	to continue strong, but it would be a new series which came to define handheld gaming in the 90s.
8725420	8730300	Before that, Nintendo would release the highly experimental and rather disastrous
8730300	8736380	Virtual Boy in 1995, a 32-bit technically portable headset and controller.
8737500	8742140	The Virtual Boy was the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D,
8742140	8747260	although it was only in red and black, and there were concerns about long-term use,
8747260	8752940	causing permanent eye damage. It was also pushed to market before it was truly ready
8752940	8758220	and received negative reviews for its high price, uncomfortable design, and weak selection of games
8758220	8764540	that struggled to use its novel 3D effect in interesting ways. Ultimately, the Virtual Boy
8764540	8769900	ended as a clear failure, and was discontinued less than a year after its launch before even
8769900	8776540	receiving a European release, but it was at least one of gaming's more innovative and unique failures.
8778060	8782700	For Nintendo, this appointment wouldn't last long, however, because they were about to stumble
8782700	8786300	onto a game that would single-handedly conquer the world.
8802940	8811500	Pokemon released in 1996 in Japan, 1998 in America, and 1999 in Europe. It was inspired by creator
8811500	8817020	Satoshi Tajiri's childhood hobby of collecting insects, but upon hearing the idea for the game,
8817020	8822860	Nintendo were initially skeptical. In the end, it was support from Shigeru Miyamoto
8822860	8827740	that helped get the game off the ground, with the Game Boy's link cable enabled multiplayer
8827740	8832460	acting as a major influence in creating a game focused on collecting and trading,
8832460	8838460	rather than being a more traditional RPG. The idea to have different versions of the same
8838460	8843580	game with exclusive Pokemon came from Miyamoto, who thought it would encourage the game's social
8843580	8852060	aspects. And in the end, Miyamoto and Tajiri would be proving right, but success didn't happen overnight.
8853420	8858700	After a long and problematic development, Pocket Monsters Red and Green released in
8858700	8864860	Japan to decent but not remarkable sales. By the end of its first year, the game sold over
8864860	8870220	1 million copies in Japan alone, but then, instead of slowing down like most releases,
8870220	8877500	Pocket Monsters did the opposite. With a blue and yellow version released later to renew interest
8877500	8882860	and strong word of mouth as a result of the game's social aspects, sales just continued to grow,
8882860	8891020	with 3.65 million copies sold in Japan in 1997. To put this in perspective, the total lifetime
8891020	8897420	sales for the Game Boy in the region at this time was only 7 million, but then Game Boy sales
8897420	8904300	started to shoot up as well. By the end of a slow localization process, Nintendo and Game Freak
8904300	8909980	had finally started to realize the potential value of what they had their hands on, and so they decided
8909980	8915100	to increase the game's marketing, tying the game's promotion to the upcoming anime and the series
8915580	8923660	mascot, Pikachu. Across America and Europe, Pokemon Red and Blue broke sales record after sales
8923660	8931420	record, with 31 million copies sold worldwide, or 46 million including all versions. It was later
8931420	8937180	described as the most successful video game of all time and received the world record for best
8937180	8943900	selling video game excluding bundle sales. In short, Pokemon was a phenomenon unlike anything
8943900	8949660	seen before in the history of gaming, and it was a phenomenon that didn't stop at the games.
8950860	8957660	An anime, a card game, merchandise, accessories, movies, spinoffs, sequels and more, all in mere
8957660	8962540	months as the franchise grew and grew, with children all around the world doing whatever
8962540	8969100	they could to get their hands on anything and everything Pokemon. For a short period of time,
8969100	8973820	the world seemed to stand still, gripped in the midst of a genuine Pokemonia.
8974940	8980060	It was possibly the biggest cultural phenomenon the modern world has seen, and it's hard to
8980060	8987180	think of any one thing that has matched it since. To this day, Pokemon is the highest grossing media
8987180	8994300	franchise in the world, surpassing Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Marvel, and it doesn't
8994380	9000140	look like anything will be catching up with it anytime soon. If there were any doubts still
9000140	9005500	about the gaming industry's mainstream potential by the late 90s, they didn't survive the arrival
9005500	9012700	of Pokemon, and all this, every bit of it, was kicked off on the back of one simple game.
9013980	9018620	When people talk about the greatest games of all time, there are a lot of obvious choices,
9018700	9021740	but Pokemon Red and Blue might be one of the most overlooked.
9022940	9027580	Aimed primarily at children, with a legacy that has far outgrown the original titles,
9027580	9032540	it's easy to forget how fresh and addictively enjoyable Pokemon's concept of combining role
9032540	9039020	playing mechanics with monster collection truly was to players at the time. It provided a perfect
9039020	9044460	introduction to the RPG genre, but it also added excitement and personality to the experience,
9044540	9048060	with players feeling a strong sense of attachment to their pocket companions,
9048060	9051900	and always wanting to see what new creatures awaited them in the next location,
9052460	9057820	or which Pokemon might evolve next, or what secrets that might be out there in the world
9057820	9063900	waiting to be uncovered. The multiplayer aspects and growth of the franchise beyond gaming then
9063900	9068620	helped turn Pokemon into the unprecedented craze that it became, but that wouldn't have been
9068620	9074060	possible if not for the strength of the original games, which makes them seem worthy of a special
9074060	9080220	place in gaming's history. And as for the Game Boy, it soon received an updated model with the
9080220	9087500	Game Boy Color, which released globally in late 1998. Its best-selling game was, unsurprisingly,
9087500	9091900	the next entry into the Pokemon series, but it included full backwards compatibility with the
9091900	9096940	Game Boy's existing library, allowing Game Boy Color owners to not only play their old games,
9096940	9103340	but also play them in color. Amidst surging Pokemonia, the new Game Boy sold well,
9103340	9109420	with combined sales with the original reaching over 118 million units, making it the fourth
9109420	9115260	best-selling system of all time. It was also surprisingly long-lasting, with the Game Boy's
9115260	9122380	lifespan starting in 1989 and lasting until 2003, which wasn't bad for a system that released
9122380	9128940	already far behind its competition in terms of technological power. And as for that competition,
9129500	9135260	by the mid-90s it barely existed, although the Japanese-only Wonderswan from Bandai did mean
9135260	9141020	there was at least one other system out there at the end of the decade. Regardless, when it came
9141020	9147420	to handhelds, the 90s was a period of absolute Nintendo domination, to a degree rarely seen
9147420	9155020	in the industry before or since. Still, the Game Boy wasn't the only system that ended the decade well.
9159580	9166140	On computers, the second half of the 90s are best remembered for the growing presence of online
9166140	9172540	gaming and for the large number of critically acclaimed genre-defining titles. PC gaming experienced
9172540	9177180	slower growth than consoles during this period, but the PlayStation itself marked a move towards
9177180	9182220	more PC-friendly development and many of the console's best-selling games like Tomb Raider,
9182220	9188220	Final Fantasy and Resident Evil were also released on Windows. The PC still had plenty
9188300	9192780	of exclusives of its own though, and it still led the way in a number of key genres.
9194220	9199740	1997 kicked off with Blizzard's Action RPG Diablo, which took the role-playing genre in a new
9199740	9206060	direction and reached new levels of commercial success as a result. Before Diablo, computer RPGs
9206060	9211180	were known for their complexity and were often seen as rather niche, but Diablo's isometric
9211180	9217340	action stripped away some of the depth to instead place a heavier focus on atmosphere, combat and
9217340	9224540	item progression, going on to sell over 2 million copies as a result. If action didn't appeal to
9224540	9231420	you, 1997 also saw the release of a major step for more traditional RPGs with Interplay's Fallout,
9231420	9236860	which featured a bleak post-apocalyptic setting and a morally ambiguous choice-driven storyline
9236860	9244060	to provide a fresh take on the role-playing genre. 1997 also saw a landmark real-time strategy game
9244140	9248940	with Ensemble Studios Age of Empires, which proved to be a popular historical take on the
9248940	9256220	genre and featured impressive online and network play integration. Its sequel in 1999 was even
9256220	9262620	more successful and has retained an active multiplayer community to this day. Growing
9262620	9267980	access to online connectivity also paved the way for one of the year's most important releases
9267980	9274300	in Origin System's Ultima Online, which became the first game to create a multiplayer online
9274300	9281660	RPG on a genuinely massive scale. Building on what was started with mods many years earlier,
9281660	9288700	Ultima Online offered an open-ended player-driven experience with up to 2,500 simultaneous players
9288700	9294460	in a single virtual world, which far surpassed any other game of the time and popularized the
9294460	9301740	idea of the MMO. 1998 saw the focus on online gaming continue with the arrival of Blizzard's
9301740	9308220	next major series. StarCraft featured a well-made campaign and a rich sci-fi setting, but what truly
9308220	9314380	set it apart was the popularity of its multiplayer. Using Blizzard's integrated Battle.net service,
9314380	9320540	StarCraft offered fast and efficient matchmaking and its highly distinctive yet well-balanced factions
9320540	9326220	were a perfect fit for competitive multiplayer. This led to it becoming the best-selling RTS game
9326220	9332700	of all time, with 11 million copies sold by 2009. It also did much to establish the modern
9332700	9337740	esports scene as we know it today, particularly with its popularity in South Korea, where televised
9337740	9346220	commentated tournaments began as early as December 1999. Other important games of 1998 include Grim
9346220	9350700	Fandango, a highly original point-and-click adventure game from genre veteran's LucasArts,
9351580	9356780	Thief the Dark Project, a first-person stealth game from Looking Glass Studios known for its
9356780	9362940	immersive design and vast player freedom, and BioWare's Baldur's Gate, a fancy RPG that set a
9362940	9367500	new standard for Dungeons & Dragons based video games and marked the start of a new era for the
9367500	9374940	genre. 1998 would also see Valve make their gaming debut with their genre defining Half-Life.
9376300	9381020	With its immersive, seamless story, regular integration of puzzles,
9381020	9386620	and humble, scientist protagonist, Half-Life was almost the polar opposite of Doom,
9386620	9390700	and it showcased the genre's potential for storytelling while proving that first-person
9390700	9398140	shooters could be much more than just Doom clones. In 1999, Ultimate Online was joined by another
9398140	9405500	massive MMO by way of EverQuest from Sony Online Entertainment. EverQuest soon surpassed
9405500	9411100	Ultimate Online's player count and established the formula of leveling, partying, dungeon running,
9411100	9415900	and gearing that would come to define so much of the genre and would be copied by so many future
9415900	9422380	games. 1999 also saw the release of Heroes of Might and Magic 3, which gave turn-based strategy
9422380	9426700	fans a cult classic title but is still one of the best examples of its genre to this day.
9427660	9432620	System Shock 2, which combined role-playing with first-person shooting and survival horror elements
9432620	9438860	to create a sci-fi cyberpunk classic, and Planescape Torment, which gave the decade one of its most
9438860	9444060	memorable RPGs while winning much praise for its mature story, intelligent writing, and thematic
9444060	9450780	depth. The 90s would close out in fitting fashion, with two multiplayer-focused FPS games going head
9450780	9457740	to head for the title of best online shooter. The first was Quake 3 Arena, the latest game from
9457740	9464700	id Software, and the other was Unreal Tournament from Epic Games. Both games were multiplayer-only
9464700	9471500	arena shooters, and both games offered impressive 3D graphics and lightning-fast action. Unreal
9471500	9475820	stood out for its greater variety of guns and gamemodes, while Quake was often considered the
9475820	9481020	game of choice for traditionalists, but regardless of individual allegiance, collectively the two
9481020	9486220	games represented the pinnacle of arena shooters at a time when arena shooters were the undisputed
9486220	9492460	kings of the FPS genre. Amongst the already mentioned games were a number of other successful
9492460	9498460	series and sequels, including a number of popular simulation and strategy games. Together, these
9498460	9504380	gave the PC a rather diverse lineup of games, and this was a time when PC gaming was still largely
9504380	9510540	distinct from that seen on consoles. In the end, though, the 90s were the decade where PC gaming
9510540	9515260	moved towards the mainstream while still managing to maintain much of what originally made it unique.
9515900	9519500	From talented young developers making industry-changing breakthroughs
9519500	9523580	to the long-running focus on depth and complexity in game design,
9523580	9527260	or the general tendency of catering to more mature audiences.
9528540	9533500	The 90s was also the decade that online gaming made its big breakthrough, which can be seen in
9533500	9539100	the popularity of new genres like MMOs, real-time strategy games, and first-person shooters.
9540060	9544140	With time, online gaming played a greater and greater role in the industry,
9544700	9550540	but it was PC that led the charge while providing a glimpse at gaming's future in the process.
9557100	9563980	The 90s was the decade where gaming grew up. It began with all our war between Sega and Nintendo,
9564060	9569820	but in the end, it was Sony who emerged victorious, and for once, it wasn't because of game design.
9571100	9575900	This marked a changing point for the industry. Atari succeeded because they were the ones who
9575900	9581020	first brought high-quality arcade games to consoles. Nintendo brought console gaming back
9581020	9586060	from the brink with being Nintendo's seal of approval and a focus on high-quality first-party
9586060	9592540	titles. Sega finally managed to match Nintendo only after their own Landmark series arrived by
9592540	9598300	way of Sonic, and the Game Boy flourished thanks in large part to Tetris and later Pokémon.
9599500	9605020	Sony, however, achieved victory through business and hardware, leaving most of the game design to
9605020	9610060	those who already knew how and instead placing their focus on effective marketing and designing
9610060	9615100	a system that appealed to developers through ease of development. This showed the growing
9615100	9621580	importance of third parties, who had come a long way since Activision first broke away from Atari
9621580	9628300	to get the recognition they felt they deserved. Now, third parties were no longer just an annoyance
9628300	9633980	and they were no longer optional. Nintendo filled in a great lineup of first-party titles in the
9633980	9638300	fifth generation, with several being remembered as some of the greatest games of all time,
9638940	9645100	but the Nintendo 64 had a total of 388 licensed games released in its lifespan
9645100	9652860	compared to over 3,000 for the PlayStation. The 90s also saw rapid evolution of technology
9652860	9659020	and might be the single most transformative decade in gaming. The move to 3D was a major
9659020	9664460	part of this, with arcades leading the way in the early 90s alongside certain pioneering PC
9664460	9670380	and console releases. By the end of the 90s, however, the entire industry had embraced 3D
9670380	9674780	technology and the advancements being made within just a few years were staggering.
9676060	9681980	Alongside 3D, the 90s was also the decade of the CD, which paved the way for full-motion video,
9681980	9687260	realistic audio and more detailed textures, and the decade where online gaming and competitive
9687260	9691580	multiplayer found their footing, with several new genres being established which would only
9691580	9698220	grow in importance in the years to come. Finally, for game design, the 90s was the decade where
9698220	9704860	games started to go big and to shed their arcade origins. If someone were to try to pinpoint the
9704860	9712700	start of AAA gaming, it might have to be Final Fantasy VII. With a huge budget, a massive marketing
9712700	9718300	campaign and a development staff of over 100 people, it was simply a different kind of game
9718300	9724060	to what was being produced at the start of the decade. For comparison, many of Nintendo's most
9724060	9730780	iconic 16-bit games had development teams of around 10 to 20, but with new technology came
9730780	9736620	higher demands on game developers and by the end of the 90s, games in general were becoming bigger
9736620	9743260	and more expensive to create. The 90s also saw a substantial move towards the cinematic
9743260	9748060	and the idea of games as a unique medium to tell stories rather than just as a set of challenges
9748060	9753660	for players to overcome. This can be seen in titles like Metal Gear Solid and Half-Life
9753660	9757340	and their popularity clearly showed that this approach resonated with players.
9757900	9763260	While at the same time as this, traditional arcade features like high scores and lives
9763260	9766620	were starting to disappear amongst gaming's most popular titles.
9768140	9773260	Overall though, the 90s was an exciting time for gaming, with fierce rivalries, impressive
9773260	9780060	technological progress and many new emerging genres. But as a new millennium beckoned,
9780060	9784220	the industry was getting ready to experience rapid change all over again.
9791340	9794140	The 2000s were a massive decade for video games.
9795100	9801420	Technological innovations of the 90s matured with rapid advances in 3D and online. The console
9801420	9806940	wars continued with the arrival of the next and final major player, followed by a seventh generation
9806940	9812060	that no one could have predicted. And game development moved further towards the AAA,
9812060	9816940	at the same time that new areas of the industry started to arrive, changing gaming forever more.
9818140	9823340	Still, at the dawn of the new millennium, the gaming industry was defined by uncertainty.
9824380	9829660	After months of panic about a Y2K computing apocalypse that in the end didn't happen,
9830220	9835500	the industry then ran headfirst into a much realer crisis when the dot-com bubble burst,
9835500	9839740	leading to a stock market crash that hit the tech industry particularly hard,
9839740	9844540	all of while gamers around the world held their breath in anticipation of the next generation
9844540	9851340	of consoles. Many questions were on people's minds. How would Sony follow up the most successful
9851340	9856220	console of all time? How would Nintendo respond to losing the top spot in the previous generation?
9856860	9861900	Would Sega be able to do enough to survive? And what would be the impact of the computing
9861900	9866060	giant Microsoft throwing their hat into the increasingly crowded arena?
9867420	9871580	Before the next wave of systems could really get going, however, the previous generation
9871580	9876620	enjoyed one of its finest years, as developers pushed fifth-gen consoles to their limits,
9876620	9883660	and PC saw the arrival of its best-selling game yet. Highlights on the Nintendo 64
9883660	9888220	include the surreal sequel to Ocarina of Time, a legend of Zelda Majora's Mask,
9888220	9893500	which featured a time loop mechanic alongside a surprisingly dark tone to create an experience
9893500	9899980	just as memorable as its predecessor and almost as universally acclaimed. Perfect Dark from N64
9899980	9904460	Heavyweight Rare, which was a spiritual successor to GoldenEye that built upon the landmark Shooters
9904460	9908940	gameplay while adding a multitude more options to create the fifth generation's definitive
9908940	9915020	first-person shooter, and Paper Mario, which continued the Mario RPG tradition established
9915020	9919580	on the Super Nintendo with a new take on the concept and a new two-dimensional art style.
9921260	9925500	On the PlayStation, Final Fantasy continued its strong critical and commercial run with Final
9925500	9930940	Fantasy 9, which featured a return to the more traditional fancy settings of older games alongside
9930940	9936380	some of the most spectacular pre-rendered graphics on the system. 2000 was also a year that Final
9936380	9941820	Fantasy was joined by the 32-bit debut of its great rival in Dragon Quest 7, which quickly
9941820	9946940	went on to become the best-selling PlayStation game of all time in Japan despite its late release.
9947500	9953660	And finally, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 refined the formula of its 1999 predecessor to become one
9953660	9959500	of the most critically acclaimed games ever made. It might be tempting to see Tony Hawk's as just
9959500	9964700	a series of well-made skating games, but to do so would be a great injustice, as they were clear
9964700	9969900	examples of games so good they transcended their genre with simple yet addictively enjoyable
9969900	9974380	gameplay that helped them secure an immortal place within early 2000s gaming culture.
9975740	9981100	The PC also saw its share of big releases, with RPG fans in particular being spoilt for choice.
9982220	9987180	Bioware's follow-up to Baldur's Gate provided an expansive and deep sequel that still remains
9987180	9992380	as one of the best examples of its genre to this day. Ion Storm's cyberpunk conspiracy
9992380	9997100	thriller Deus Ex impressed with its open-ended mission design and high level of player choice,
9997820	10003340	and Blizzard's loop-filled action RPG series Diablo returned in its second entry with improvements
10003340	10009420	to gameplay and a story that made it even more popular than its predecessor. 2000s would also
10009420	10014140	see the release of another important FPS that offered something markedly different from the
10014140	10020380	popular arena shooters of the time. Originally a mod for Half-Life, Counter-Strike placed a
10020380	10025180	greater focus on realism and the tactical side of the genre and quickly received plenty of attention
10025180	10030620	online including from Half-Life creators Valve who offered to buy the intellectual property
10030620	10036460	and hire the mods creator before releasing the game officially. Counter-Strike helped create
10036460	10041500	an enduring esports scene as well as a number of hugely successful sequels and showed the
10041500	10046220	innovative nature and potential benefits of a game supporting modding, something that has
10046220	10052780	become increasingly rare in games as times went on. Of course none of the games mentioned so far
10052780	10059340	come close to matching the impact of the year's biggest release. From Maxis and SimCity creator
10059340	10066540	Will Wright, The Sims was like nothing else before it. As a social simulation with impressive
10066540	10072380	building tools, Sims turned life itself into a video game and wowed players with the amount of
10072380	10078300	freedom it gave them and the level of detail it managed to include. From carefully guiding your
10078300	10083980	Sims up the corporate ladder and finally purchasing the local mega mansion to turning their life into
10083980	10090620	an inescapable never-ending hell, The Sims was a massive hit with players and received 7 expansions
10090620	10097100	which was a huge amount for the time. It also sold over 11 million copies making it the best
10097100	10102140	selling PC game of all time until it was overtaken several years later by its sequel.
10103100	10109180	Much like Pac-Man or Tetris before it, The Sims was a game which found unprecedented levels of
10109180	10115900	success by appealing to people who may not have typically played video games. By 2000 personal
10115900	10121260	computers were starting to become a common household item and The Sims universally understandable
10121260	10126860	concept and general accessibility made it the perfect gateway to the medium for those who may
10126860	10131900	not have been swayed by the fast paced deathmatches of Quake or the advanced Dungeons and Dragons
10131900	10139580	of computer RPGs. Accessibility and broadened appeal would be a major part of the decade but
10139580	10144780	not before the next generation of console wars got underway in fittingly dramatic fashion.
10150940	10155820	The Dreamcast got off to a solid start and its launch lineup was followed by a number of memorable
10155820	10161340	titles. The most important was Shenmue which Sega hoped to be the system's killer app.
10162460	10168540	Featuring advanced 3D graphics and FMV cutscenes alongside a detailed open world complete with
10168540	10174300	NPC schedules, variable weather effects and a day-night cycle Shenmue was a major step forward
10174300	10180460	for open world game design. Ambitious, innovative and technologically impressive it received much
10180460	10188300	critical praise and sold well although unfortunately not well enough. With development costs of around
10188300	10194300	50 million dollars Shenmue was one of the most expensive games ever made and its sales of 1.2
10194300	10199820	million weren't enough to recoup such a high investment. It also didn't become the major
10199820	10205420	system seller Sega hoped it would be meaning for the Dreamcast there was still more work that needed
10205420	10212540	to be done. Other strong early performers on the system included Crazy Taxi, an arcade infused
10212540	10218940	action packed racing game, Jet Set Radio a skating action hybrid that embodied counterculture and was
10218940	10224780	one of the first games to feature the use of cell shading and Fantasy Star Online a continuation of
10224780	10232700	Sega's popular fantasy star series and the first ever online RPG to appear on consoles. Fantasy Star
10232700	10238220	Online showcased the Dreamcast's impressive online capabilities and was particularly successful
10238220	10244780	with Japanese audiences where online PC gaming still hadn't really caught on. In the end though
10244780	10250940	the Dreamcast's fate would be decided more by its competition than its games and 2000
10250940	10255260	was the year that Sony's next gen successor was ready to make its debut.
10268460	10275580	Following the tremendous success of the PlayStation many were left wondering how Sony would top the
10275580	10282140	best selling games console of all time. Sony's answer was to leave people wondering meaning
10282140	10287020	information about the PlayStation 2's development was kept as secret as possible with Sony refusing
10287020	10293420	to even confirm that they were working on a new system. Secrecy wouldn't last forever though and
10293420	10300620	at the Tokyo Game Show in September of 1999 the PlayStation 2 was revealed with demos for Gran Turismo
10300620	10306540	and Tekken to show off its next gen graphical capability. It wasn't the games or graphics
10306540	10311020	that impressed the audience the most though but rather two specific design features.
10312220	10316940	The first was full backwards compatibility that covered the entire PlayStation 1 library
10316940	10322220	as well as some of its accessories like its controllers. At the time backwards compatibility
10322220	10327740	was an often requested feature yet the only other console to provide it without additional add-ons
10327740	10335260	had been the otherwise disappointing Atari 7800. And if backwards compatibility alone wasn't enough
10335260	10341340	the PlayStation 2 also included a built-in DVD player. This was when DVD players were still
10341340	10348220	relatively new and standalone units could often cost more than the PS2's 299 launch price which
10348300	10353900	made it seem like great value for money and helped its reputation as being more than just a games console.
10355180	10359420	When this was combined with the strong momentum behind Sony's brand after the success of their
10359420	10365020	last system it was enough to ensure the PlayStation 2's launch was a big success with the new console
10365020	10371740	selling out in Japan and later America as Sony struggled to meet the high demand. The launch
10371740	10376780	lineup was also noticeably weak with few heavy hitters outside of perhaps Tekken tag tournament
10376780	10383420	from Namco and low first party titles from Sony but in the end this didn't matter too much as in
10383420	10389820	October 2000 the PlayStation 2 finally arrived in America and quickly became the public's most
10389820	10392860	wanted games console.
10420460	10426540	For Sega the impact was immediate and amidst now rapidly declining Dreamcast sales
10426540	10432060	and yearly losses of over 400 million dollars the discontinuation of a Dreamcast was announced
10432060	10439980	on the 31st of January 2001. This would be the end of the line for Sega's hardware aspirations
10439980	10446300	but they would live on as a third party developer and publisher and in March 2003 the company finally
10446380	10452940	had a profitable year again after five years of consecutive losses. As for Sony having collected
10452940	10458300	one scalp already they turned their attention to those who remained and prepared themselves
10458300	10462300	for what would go on to be one of the biggest years in video game history.
10477260	10484700	Microsoft unveiled their debut gaming system at the consumer electronic show in January 2001
10485340	10489900	and right from the start Microsoft wanted the world to know how seriously they were taking
10489900	10494620	the industry with major marketing campaigns being launched alongside offers to acquire
10494620	10502620	several big players including Nintendo, Square and EA. The decision to enter the console space came
10502620	10508300	after seeing the PlayStation success in the last generation with then-CEO Bill Gates worried that
10508300	10513740	an unopposed Sony could become so dominant that they might threaten Microsoft's line of Windows
10513740	10520300	PCs. Microsoft had also seen the way the PlayStation's PC focus development kits had won them third
10520300	10527420	party support which led to the idea of just creating a console using PC hardware and DirectX
10527420	10534220	programming interfaces with the use of DirectX being what led to the console being named Xbox.
10535660	10541100	The result was a powerful system with technical specifications notably beyond any of its competitors.
10542060	10547900	The console included a built-in DVD player just like the PS2 as well as a hard drive and impressive
10547900	10557260	online support but Microsoft was called MicroSoft for a reason i.e. they were a software company
10557580	10561660	meaning that at the time they had no actual experience in manufacturing hardware.
10562860	10568860	This led to expensive development and manufacturing costs with Microsoft ultimately making a loss
10568860	10575020	on each unit sold. Still luckily for them if there was one thing Microsoft did have available
10575580	10582300	it was money and in November 2001 the Xbox released in America three days before the
10582300	10604940	arrival of the sixth gen's final contender. Nintendo might have been down after their last
10604940	10610300	gen defeat in the PlayStation but unlike Sega they were far from out with dominance still in the
10610300	10617100	handheld market and a strong selection of established first party series. For their next system
10617100	10622540	Nintendo's priority was to avoid the mistakes which cost them with their last console. This
10622540	10628220	meant no more cartridges although they didn't opt for a DVD based system either and instead used the
10628220	10634300	more data limited mini-disc. They also tried to ensure the system was easier to develop for
10634300	10637420	and that it didn't release significantly later than the rest of the competition.
10638380	10644940	Nintendo did try out several more experimental features including stereoscopic 3D, motion controls,
10644940	10650940	portability and microphone support but for now these ideas played little role in the final console.
10651980	10657580	And so Nintendo's GameCube was a fairly traditional system that was less powerful than
10657580	10664220	Microsoft's Xbox but with a slight technological edge over Sony's PS2 in CPU and graphics card.
10665180	10669500	The marketing focused on Nintendo's reputation and first party success
10669500	10675820	making use of the catchphrase the Nintendo difference but one thing which did remain the same
10675820	10679980	was a lack of effort on Nintendo's part to entice third party exclusives.
10681260	10686380	Nintendo also weren't able to meet their initial target of the holiday season in the year 2000
10686380	10691180	which would have seen their new console launch alongside Sony's but at least this time they
10691180	10698220	wouldn't be quite so far behind and at E3 2001 the system was fully unveiled with Shigeru Miyamoto
10698220	10702860	himself taking to the stage to announce the release date and launch lineup with a later
10702860	10709420	price reveal putting the GameCube at $199, 100 less than its two rivals.
10710940	10716940	Unlike every Nintendo console before it however something or someone was noticeably absent
10716940	10722220	as for the first time Nintendo would be launching their system without a Mario game to support it.
10723340	10729340	In Mario's place was his brother in Luigi's Mansion which went on to receive positive reviews
10729340	10733740	but was a far cry from the generational defining Mario titles of earlier consoles.
10735180	10740540	Luckily for Nintendo though even if Luigi wasn't able to develop to his big brother's big reputation
10740540	10743820	Nintendo did have another title mere months away which could.
10744780	10752140	Super Smash Bros. Melee tipped the formula of its predecessor and ran with it featuring more characters,
10752140	10757660	more stages, more gameplay modes, more music and updated multiplayer but ensured it would
10757660	10763500	be a hit with fans and critics alike even decades later. Melee went on to be the GameCube's best
10763500	10768780	selling title and acted as a fantastic showcase of what Nintendo were bringing to the sixth generation.
10769500	10774780	Microsoft however had a killer app of their own to mark their entry into the console space.
10775820	10780220	Most of Microsoft's early efforts to buy third party developers weren't successful
10780220	10785020	but one company they did acquire was a relatively unknown yet still successful
10785020	10792380	Macintosh developer by the name of Bungie. The studio's sci-fi FPS series Marathon was exactly
10792380	10797660	the type of game that might appeal to western audiences but its Mac only status had previously
10797660	10803820	limited its reach. In the late 90s Bungie had begun work on a follow-up to Marathon and after
10803820	10811260	it was unveiled at 1999's Mac World Expo by none other than Apple CEO Steve Jobs, Microsoft decided
10811260	10816220	to swoop in and make their move, impressing the team at Bungie with their commitment to the gaming
10816220	10822380	industry and securing the studio and their new title exclusively for Xbox in the process.
10822460	10828380	With this Microsoft had now found their tempo title to centre the Xbox's launch around but for
10828380	10834620	Bungie things would be far from simple. The switch from computer to console brought a number of
10834620	10839900	development challenges. The team's deadline was incredibly tight and the weight of an entire new
10839900	10847100	console was being placed quite squarely on their game's shoulders. In the end though Halo proved
10848060	10853820	up to the task launching alongside the Xbox and becoming an instant critical and commercial success.
10855020	10861660	Halo was a very ambitious game. The biggest surprise then might be that in the end all its
10861660	10868540	ambitions seemed to pay off. Featuring vehicle combat alongside massive open world like environments
10868540	10875660	with impressive enemy variety, AI behaviour and encounter design Halo was a fantastic game but
10875660	10881820	even more impressive was how well it played on console. Bungie added subtle auto-aim to
10881820	10886940	accommodate for the use of a gamepad over a mouse and used a system of input buffering to make
10886940	10893100	movements feel smoother and more precise. The result was a huge step forward for the console
10893100	10902460	FPS genre and the creation of Xbox's first true blockbuster title. But while Nintendo had Melee
10902460	10909340	and Microsoft had Halo, Sony on the other hand had what might be the single greatest year of
10909340	10918620	console exclusives in all of video game history. 2001 was massive for the PlayStation 2. Many of
10918620	10925260	the PS1's best-selling series would see sequels with Gran Turismo 3, A-Spec, Final Fantasy 10 and
10925260	10931500	Metal Gear Solid 2 each releasing to universal acclaim and incredible sales. What's more each
10931500	10936220	of these games showcased outstanding graphics making the difference in the new generation
10936220	10942940	crystal clear to potential buyers. Alongside these was another important title that would leave a
10942940	10949500	lasting impact on game design and would kick off the PS2's best-selling series Rockstars
10949500	10957260	Grand Theft Auto 3. This wasn't the first Grand Theft Auto game but it was the first in 3D and
10957260	10962540	its fully open world and emphasis on player freedom was unlike anything that came before it.
10963580	10968140	It remains a landmark open world game and did much to change people's conception of what
10968140	10973980	video games could achieve and this was still just one of many major titles releasing on the
10973980	10981340	PlayStation 2 that year. Looking back today the most impressive thing about the PS2's 2001 release
10981340	10987900	lineup is surely its diversity with different genres and tastes being catered to and innovative
10987900	10994300	new titles coming alongside the more expected big sequels. Ico gave players something original,
10994300	11000220	mature and creative. Capcom's Devil May Cry brought arcade inspired action and created its own
11000220	11005660	new genre in the process. Konami's Silent Hill 2 gave the console one of the greatest horror games
11005660	11010940	ever made. Naughty Dogs Jack and Daxter brought Sony a major new series and offered something
11010940	11017260	a little more lighthearted and there are other games that could be mentioned here too. The PlayStation
11017260	11023740	2's lineup was stacked and this was exactly what Sony needed to keep them on top amidst the launch
11023740	11030060	of their rivals new consoles. Still even if the PlayStation 2 would end the year ahead,
11030060	11035820	both the Xbox and Gamecube did see strong initial sales with many retailers selling out of the
11035820	11042700	systems. Each console also had its own clear advantage with the Gamecube being the cheapest
11042700	11049900	and the Xbox being the most technologically advanced and so in 2002 Sony set out to take
11049900	11056940	those advantages away. To do this they cut the price of the PS2 to $199 to bring it in line with
11056940	11062540	the Gamecube and set about creating a PlayStation Network adapter add on alongside several first
11062540	11068940	party online focus titles like Socom to compete with Microsoft soon to be launching Xbox Live.
11070380	11075980	2002 would also bring a number of PS2 exclusives with the three biggest being Square's latest
11075980	11081420	action RPG Kingdom Hearts which combined Final Fantasy characters with massive Disney franchises,
11081980	11086460	Insomniac Games Ratchet and Clank, an important action platformer that would get a number of
11086460	11093020	sequels on the system and Rockstar's Grand 5th Auto Vice City which followed on from GTA 3
11093020	11098860	by bringing the series to a new city and new decade and found even greater success in the process.
11100380	11105100	Nintendo and Microsoft had other important titles in the following years as well but each
11105100	11111420	company would also experience their own third party struggles. Nintendo did finally receive
11111500	11116140	the Mario game they needed with Super Mario Sunshine which featured a tropical setting
11116140	11122620	and a new spin on 3D Mario gameplay. Other classic Nintendo series would also get new entries
11122620	11127980	with Metroid Prime seeing Metroid make its 3D debut in an atmospheric and immersive take on
11127980	11133900	earlier games that retained much of what made the original special. Zelda returned with Wind Waker
11133900	11138700	which saw players take to the ocean and explore many islands in a new cell shaded art style
11138700	11144060	that was a dramatic departure from the previous games. Mario Kart returned with Double Dash
11144060	11149740	which replaced the sprite to be N64 version with full 3D and allowed two riders per kart
11149740	11155740	to provide a new take on co-op gameplay. Animal Crossing and Pikmin made their debuts giving
11155740	11161740	players a relaxed open-ended life sim alongside a highly original real-time strategy puzzle game
11162380	11167980	and other Nintendo series like Mario Party rounded out what was admittedly a strong first
11167980	11175180	party lineup. When it came to third party support however Nintendo were once more at a disadvantage
11175180	11179820	after having done little to secure exclusive third party titles in the lead up to the sixth
11179820	11186140	generation. What's more rare a developer who had done more to support Nintendo than any other in
11186140	11191420	the last two generations started to experience financial difficulties and were forced to look
11191420	11197020	for a buyer. Nintendo already had a significant stake in the company and could have purchased the
11197020	11203420	rest but they instead declined leaving room for other interested parties like Nintendo's newest
11203420	11210060	rival Microsoft. While rare did release one Gamecube title before this their acquisition
11210060	11215660	by Microsoft still left Nintendo's already lacklustre third party support even more lacking.
11217180	11221420	In a strange twist of fate one of Nintendo's most prominent third party developers in this
11221420	11227820	period was none other than Sega who brought a number of series to the Gamecube including Sonic
11227820	11234700	and Fantasy Star. The only other notable third party that provided exclusives was Capcom who
11234700	11239980	would bring a number of Resident Evil games including timed exclusivity on Resident Evil 4
11239980	11247500	alongside some new IPs. Still while the Gamecube did have exclusives it also found itself left out
11247500	11254220	of certain multi-platform releases as the generations stretched on. Some examples include
11254220	11261260	Burnout 3, Black, Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2, certain entries into the Pro Evolution
11261260	11267340	Soccer series, Hitman contracts and Blood Money, Binlight Club 2 and so on.
11268380	11273100	Individually none of these titles may have been deal breakers but the cumulative effect
11273180	11277660	meant the Gamecube had the smallest library and came to be seen as the worst system for
11277660	11284060	multi-platform games. Microsoft would also eventually bring Grand 5th Auto over to Xbox
11284060	11289020	once more leaving Nintendo out of what was arguably the biggest series in gaming at the time.
11290380	11294620	To make matters worse Nintendo were also increasingly finding that they were developing
11294620	11300300	an image problem in Western markets. Amidst the gaming industry that was putting out more and
11300300	11306300	more mature titles and marketing from Sony and Microsoft aimed at securing older audiences,
11306300	11311020	Nintendo's Gamecube came to be seen as the console for younger audiences.
11312460	11317820	This reputation had been developing since their showdown with Sega but now it was starting to do
11317820	11323580	real damage, particularly with teenagers who might place a lot of value on how a gaming system is
11323580	11331260	seen by their peers. It may no longer be true today but in the early to mid 2000s Gamecube
11331260	11339420	just wasn't cool and this had an impact on sales. Meanwhile with the Xbox, Microsoft also faced
11339420	11346140	problems as they struggled to provide Master Chief with any backup. Attempts were made though,
11346140	11350300	Project Gotham Racing received strong reviews but failed to come close to matching the sales of
11350300	11356300	Sony's mega hit Gran Turismo. Blinks the Time Sweeper would see key star from the Sonic series
11356300	11361500	creating an Xbox exclusive platformer but it too failed to make a major impact
11362220	11367340	and new acquisition Rare failed to live up to their past heights with games like Grabbed by
11367340	11373740	the Goolies and Conquer Live and Reloaded. Microsoft's most prominent third party support
11373740	11379020	came from Japanese publisher Tecmo who made a deal early on with Microsoft and contributed
11379020	11385980	the popular fighting series Dead or Alive and the 3D action debut of Ninja Gaiden as well as from
11385980	11393020	several former PC developers who brought a number of RPGs to the console. These included Bethesda's
11393020	11399740	breakthrough open world RPG The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind, Lionhead's ambitious new IP Fable
11400540	11405340	and BioWare's popular Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire.
11405580	11409980	These RPGs would go on to be some of the most highly acclaimed titles on the system and further
11409980	11415980	cemented Xbox's growing reputation with Western audiences. But compared to the PlayStation 2's
11415980	11420860	continually expanding library, the Xbox still had a lot less to offer by comparison.
11422060	11428220	As a result, Microsoft placed great hope on their upcoming online service Xbox Live which
11429180	11433180	launched one year after the console in November 2002.
11434780	11441260	Xbox Live was an impressive service for its time, featuring friends lists, voice communication
11441260	11446620	and fast matchmaking while making use of an ethernet port and the faster broadband connection
11446620	11453020	over the still popular dial up. Its flagship launch title was Epic's Unreal Championship,
11453020	11457660	but a disagreement with Electronic Arts over the terms of the new service led to EA
11457660	11461500	withholding all of their games from Xbox Live for its first few years.
11462780	11468060	Still, Xbox's online system was a success and launched before Sony's alternative
11468060	11474060	without the need for any additional hardware. Its impact on the industry hadn't been quite
11474060	11479340	as dramatic as Microsoft had hoped for though, or at least it wasn't, until the services
11479340	11496140	killer app arrived in 2004. Halo 2's campaign was a solid follow up from the first game,
11496140	11502940	but this wasn't the main thing it came to be known for. With Halo 2, Microsoft's best series
11502940	11508620	was able to take advantage of their console's best feature and it turned out to be a match made
11508620	11514140	in heaven. Halo 1's multiplayer had already impressed, but for many players this would
11514140	11520460	be their first experience moving from split screen to online and the improvement was dramatic.
11521580	11526060	Halo 2 quickly became the console's best selling game and the most popular thing on
11526060	11531820	Xbox Live, vindicating Microsoft's decision to prioritize online features on their console
11531900	11536700	while also creating one of the most fondly remembered multiplayer experiences of all time.
11537980	11545500	But as successful as Halo 2 was, it wasn't the best selling game in 2004. In fact, it wasn't even
11545500	11551500	close, as just when Xbox fans finally had a real reason to celebrate their console's superiority,
11551500	11557900	the PlayStation 2 would see the arrival of its own best selling game with Grand Theft Auto San
11557900	11566300	Andreas, which would go on to reach an unprecedented 17 million copies sold on PlayStation 2 alone.
11567580	11572140	San Andreas took the open world design of the previous games and drastically increased the
11572140	11577980	scale, featuring three distinct cities instead of one alongside many new features that improved
11577980	11583820	immersion and customization. The game did come alongside controversy, particularly after the
11583820	11588780	modern community were able to uncover a hidden code left in the game's files but enabled a crude
11588780	11595260	sex minigame which led to outrage and a revision of the game's rating from the ESRB to the very
11595260	11601260	rarely used adult only rating. Still, this wasn't enough to stop it from becoming one of the most
11601260	11607740	successful games of all time and Sony's PlayStation 2 flourished alongside it, receiving an updated
11607740	11613020	slim model the month before its release and promptly selling out again during the holiday season.
11614300	11619020	The final years of the sixth generation would see Sony continuing to add to their already
11619020	11626380	strong lineup of games with high selling sequels to Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy,
11626380	11632700	Tekken and Kingdom Hearts alongside an impressive new action series in Santa Monica Studios God of War.
11633980	11638860	Unique titles came alongside the bigger names as well, with games like Team Icos visually
11638860	11644220	stunning and emotionally evocative Shadow of the Colossus or the weird and wonderful Katamari
11644220	11652140	Damacy from Namco. Truthfully, neither the Xbox or GameCube had bad lineups of games,
11652140	11658460	the PlayStation 2 was just on another level and this would ultimately be reflected in its sales.
11659820	11666620	Over its long, long life, the PlayStation 2 sold over 155 million units worldwide,
11667260	11672780	making it the best-selling gaming system of all time, a title it still holds to this day.
11674060	11681180	By contrast, the Xbox and GameCube sold 24 million and 21.7 million units respectively,
11681740	11687260	making this the most decisive victory of any console generation since the Nintendo Entertainment
11687260	11693580	System brought the home video game market back from the dead. Sony benefited from strong third
11693580	11700140	party support, the built-in DVD player, backwards compatibility, a highly competitive price and
11700140	11706380	a growing reputation of excellence in the console market. For both Microsoft and Nintendo,
11706380	11711740	there would be silver linings however. The Xbox successfully forged itself a place within the
11711740	11717260	console market, took second place in a highly competitive generation and found great success
11717260	11723820	with Halo and Xbox Live, two things which showed much promise for the future as online gaming and
11723820	11730380	home broadband both continued to become more and more widely adopted. Meanwhile for Nintendo,
11730380	11735100	they continued to build on their established first-party series while cementing their reputation
11735100	11740540	for making quality games. The GameCube may have suffered due to its perception as being for
11740540	11747820	younger audiences, but Nintendo may not have. Younger gamers will one day grow up and by staying
11747820	11753180	true to their vision and creating great games for all ages, Nintendo continued to create franchises
11753180	11758380	with strong nostalgic appeal and sometimes nostalgia can have great dividends in the future.
11759740	11764780	In the end, it seems fitting that the GameCube's best-selling game would be the crossover title
11764780	11770460	Super Smash Bros. Melee as no other game better represented the system's appeal or Nintendo's
11770460	11776060	strengths. Nintendo's different approach also allowed them to set themselves apart from the
11776060	11782300	competition and while that isn't always the best strategy to win, it can sometimes help you survive.
11783580	11792860	And ultimately, survive they did, as did Microsoft and while Sony's lead may have looked insurmountable,
11793420	11797100	gaming has always been an industry where things can change quickly.
11798620	11803820	Before a new wave of consoles could go head-to-head however, the handheld market would finally get
11803820	11815580	to experience a console war of its own. Nintendo had dominated the handheld market since as far
11815580	11821340	back as the original Game and Watch in 1980 and after the Game Boy beat out a number of rivals in
11821340	11828860	the early 90s, Nintendo spent years being virtually unopposed. Their reign continued in the early 2000s
11828860	11836140	with long-awaited Game Boy Advance, which released worldwide in 2001. The system still lacked a
11836140	11842460	backlit screen, a feature other handhelds had included as early as the Atari Lynx in 1989,
11843020	11849500	but otherwise it launched at an affordable $99 and compared to the now seriously dated Game Boy,
11849500	11856620	it provided a decent step up. The original Game Boy was technically inferior to the 8-bit NES,
11856620	11862220	whereas outside of the smaller screen resolution, the Game Boy Advance was technically superior
11862220	11869100	to the 16-bit Super Nintendo. This had clear benefits for games so long as you could see them
11869100	11874380	on the poorly illuminated screen that once more got to haunt a new generation of children.
11875340	11881500	Nintendo would follow the Game Boy Advance with the Advance SP two years later, which updated the
11881500	11888940	model and finally included a light source. And now that Game Boy owners could at last see what games
11888940	11894140	they were actually playing, they were in for a treat because the Game Boy Advance had an extensive
11894140	11900060	library on top of backwards compatibility with the original Game Boy's cartridges. The system's
11900060	11906300	best-selling game was Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, its second best-selling game was Pokemon Fire Red
11906300	11912300	and Leaf Green, and its third best-selling game was Pokemon Emerald. But it had successful games
11912300	11918220	outside of Pokemon as well as all the Nintendo series you'd expect, with plenty of ports of
11918220	11924620	Super Nintendo classics. One thing it didn't have was an original Mario title of its own,
11924620	11930220	but without any competition that hardly mattered, and the Game Boy Advance and Advance SP were
11930220	11937340	highly successful, with sales of over 81 million units. Still, Nintendo's era of free reign wouldn't
11937340	11944460	last forever, and at E3 2003 it was reeled that they would face new competition from the same
11944460	11950300	company who had just beaten them twice in the home console market. PlayStation Portable will allow
11950300	11956940	consumers to enjoy 3D gaming similar to the experience delivered on PlayStation 2. It also
11956940	11962780	has the ability to deliver high-quality movies, music, and video as well as other forms of digital
11962780	11969660	entertainment content through one central device. And all of this is made possible through cutting
11969660	11977740	edge technologies aimed at helping us explore the future in new ways. Sony had dabbled in the handheld
11977820	11983260	space already with the Pocket Station, a portable add-on for the PlayStation 1 that released in
11983260	11990780	1999 exclusively in Japan. Their next attempt would be rather more ambitious, and the announcement
11990780	11996460	showed off some impressively powerful technical specifications alongside a heavy focus on multimedia
11996460	12005500	support, with movies, music, and online web browsing. Sony's plan was simple, do for handhelds
12005500	12011340	what they did for consoles through following the same approach, i.e. good hardware, disk-based
12011340	12019260	operating, functionality outside of games, and strong third-party support. And, as for that hardware,
12019260	12025820	Sony were keen to highlight just how similar it was to the still mid-cycle PlayStation 2,
12025820	12030860	at a time when Nintendo's current handheld was only on the level of a two-generations-old
12030860	12037020	Super Nintendo, and their next handheld was being developed in line with the last gen N64.
12038300	12044140	Basically, Sony was planning to skip ahead and deliver a product a whole generation more advanced
12044140	12051980	than their rival. For Nintendo, however, power wasn't the main priority. The idea for their next
12051980	12059820	system came from Hiroshi Yamauchi, a man who served as Nintendo president for an incredible 53 years.
12060860	12065740	The dual screens were similar to certain models of the game and watch, and Nintendo wanted to use
12065740	12070620	their new system as a chance to innovate and move away from the conservative image that they were
12070620	12076860	worried they'd started to develop. Nintendo were still taking the handheld market seriously, though.
12076860	12081740	In fact, after the mediocre sales of the GameCube, the next generation of handhelds came to be seen
12081740	12087260	as more important than ever, with President Yamauchi famously saying that if the new system
12087340	12092380	succeeds, we will rise to heaven, but if it fails, we will sink to hell.
12093660	12099740	And so, Sony's PlayStation Portable and Nintendo's DS went head-to-head.
12100780	12104860	Both systems launched at a similar time in Japan in 2004,
12104860	12110780	although the DS had a four-to-five-month head start in other regions. The DS also had a lower
12110780	12118940	retail price of $150 to the PSP's $250. Meanwhile, the PSP had a clear advantage in hardware,
12118940	12125420	with a larger display, higher resolution, and a much more powerful CPU. This translated to far
12125420	12131340	better graphics, with the PSP succeeding at coming close to PS2 level, minus the smaller
12131340	12138060	resolution, whereas the DS was still clearly one generation behind. Nintendo's new system
12138060	12142780	did come with a touchscreen, however, and this was several years before the arrival of smartphones,
12143340	12149420	meaning few people had seen this technology before. The combination of two screens and
12149420	12155740	touch-based controls did make the DS stand out, but it wasn't initially clear to prospective buyers
12155740	12159420	just how big an impact this would have on their gaming experiences.
12160620	12166140	And so, as both systems launched, the PSP was the one generating the most hype,
12166220	12171100	with reviewers impressed by the system's power and with Sony riding high off the momentum
12171100	12177340	of two record-breaking home consoles. In Japan, both systems got off to strong starts,
12177340	12182540	with the PSP selling out faster, but the DS selling more units due to greater supply.
12183820	12188860	In America, the PSP released later and performed below Sony's expectations,
12188860	12194540	while the DS surpassed Nintendo's. Europe saw more or less the opposite though,
12194620	12199500	as while the PSP again arrived late, this time it sold out at record speeds,
12199500	12205260	quickly surpassing the earlier numbers of the DS. And so, in their first year,
12205260	12210540	the two systems seemed to be neck and neck, and attention then turned to the games.
12211580	12215980	In the console market, Sony had always excelled at attracting third parties,
12215980	12221100	but when it came to handhelds, they were still a newcomer, whereas Nintendo had been working
12221100	12227340	with third parties on handheld games for many years. As a result, both systems received plenty
12227340	12234380	of third-party support, but Sony no longer had the clear advantage. The PSP looked to continue
12234380	12239020	the success of its less portable cousins through continuations of many of Sony's best-selling
12239020	12245740	series. Its biggest success would be Grand 5th Auto Liberty City Stories, and this would be followed
12245740	12251020	by a spin-off to Jack and Daxter, a new Tekken title with Dark Resurrection, a second Grand 5th
12251020	12256540	Auto with Vice City Stories, multiple Metal Gear Solid titles with tactical card game Metal Gear
12256540	12262460	Acid, and the more traditional Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, and a new Ratchet and Clank game
12262460	12268300	in Size Matters. Later releases would see new entries into the Final Fantasy series with Crisis
12268300	12274300	Core and Decidia, a Kingdom Hearts prequel with Birth by Sleep, entries into the Gran Turismo and
12274300	12280140	God of War series, and several games from Capcom's new Monster Hunter series, which proved hugely
12280140	12286220	popular in Japan. The PSP was further helped by the addition of a miniature analog stick,
12286220	12291420	which was a feature the DS didn't have, which helped the PSP's reputation as a more serious
12291420	12298060	gaming system. Meanwhile, over on the DS, there would also be continuations of popular series,
12298060	12304140	with the first new 2D Mario since the Super Nintendo in New Super Mario Bros,
12304140	12311980	as well as Mario Kart DS, a port of Super Mario 64, Animal Crossing Wildwood, Mario Party DS,
12311980	12318380	and for Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass. However, alongside these more familiar names,
12318380	12323020	the DS would also find success with several new series that were deliberately designed around
12323020	12328860	the system's touchscreen. One of the most popular of these was Petsim, Nintendogs,
12328860	12335180	which released early on and quickly became a big hit. But amongst the DS's best-selling games
12335180	12340140	were a number of other names that didn't seem to resemble the usual gaming topsellers.
12341260	12348380	These included Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, Professor Kakayama's Maths Training,
12348380	12355260	the 100 Cell Calculation Method, Big Brain Academy, Flash Focus Vision Training in Minutes a Day,
12355820	12363260	and English Training Have Fun Improving Your Skills. If you want to know just what a big deal
12363260	12368940	Brain Age Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day was, all you need to know is that it sold more copies
12368940	12376300	than any Pokemon game released on the DS. The game was inspired by a popular Japanese book,
12376300	12382780	Train Your Brain 60 Days to a Better Brain, and after a new president of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata,
12382780	12387260	met with the author, a decision was made to implement the book's thesis in a new game
12387260	12393020	for Nintendo's upcoming handheld that they hoped might appeal to casual gamers. And it did.
12394060	12398860	Nintendo released a number of semi-educational puzzle games over the DS's lifespan,
12398860	12402300	and this became a major contributor to the success of its software sales.
12402300	12408300	Sony targeted core gamers by doing something similar to its existing consoles and found
12408300	12414140	success with the teenage and young adult markets, but Nintendo found considerable success with both
12414140	12419660	younger and older demographics, including people who may not traditionally have had much experience
12419660	12425660	with gaming. And so, just like with the design of their system, both companies had radically
12425660	12431740	different approaches with their gaming lineups, and with time, one started to perform better than
12431740	12437740	the other. The DS saw consistently stronger software sales and was able to maintain its
12437740	12444300	momentum through a number of redesigns, starting with the DS Lite in 2006, then the DSi in early
12444300	12452140	2009, and lastly with the DSi XO one year later. These redesigns weren't universally applauded,
12452140	12456940	with the DSi's removal of backwards compatibility with Game Boy games and its introduction of
12456940	12462220	digital cameras being seen as questionable, but the DS Lite in particular helped the console
12462220	12469900	maintain sales. Meanwhile, the PSP also saw hardware updates with the PSP 2000 and 3000
12469900	12476060	reducing the size and improving the screen, and the later PSP Go, providing a total model redesign
12476060	12481660	alongside a move to digital only. Still, the Go retained the system's high price,
12481660	12486940	and over time, interest in the PSP dwindled, while the DS pulled further and further ahead.
12488300	12493020	This might be because while the PSP came close to matching the PS2's best titles in terms of
12493020	12497660	graphics, its game still felt consistently inferior to their console inspirations.
12498780	12503740	Early Metal Gear titles in particular seemed to mark a dropping quality, but even the PSP's
12503740	12508060	best-selling Grand Theft Auto titles were still widely considered to be worse than the games
12508060	12514060	which inspired them. Then, as the next generation of consoles arrived with high-definition graphics,
12514060	12519580	the PSP's visuals were no longer quite so impressive, and with neither graphical prowess
12519580	12524860	or must-have games to sell the system, and competition from newly arriving smartphones
12524860	12529260	diminishing the PSP's role as a multimedia device, the system was left struggling.
12530540	12537260	Meanwhile, the DS was different in both gameplay experiences and audience, and so it was able to
12537260	12542940	maintain its more unique place within the gaming market over time. In the end, the Nintendo DS
12542940	12549420	sold over 154 million units, making it the best-selling handheld and second best-selling
12549420	12555980	system in history, only behind the PlayStation 2. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portable sold
12555980	12561980	around 18 million units, making it an impressive debut by Sony even if it still ultimately fell
12561980	12568140	well behind its competition. For handhelds overall, however, this may have been the greatest
12568140	12574540	generation in gaming history, with record numbers of titles, genuine innovation from Nintendo,
12574540	12580460	impressive power from Sony, and overall sales figures far beyond anything which came before
12580460	12587020	or after. By the end of the decade, smartphones were well on their way, bringing the new frontier
12587020	12591740	of mobile gaming with them and creating fresh competition for dedicated handheld systems.
12592780	12598780	Still, for a while, the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable put handhelds on top of the gaming world,
12599420	12604940	and with two very different systems to choose from, consumers were arguably the biggest winners
12604940	12611580	of gaming's miniature console war. Nothing lasts forever though, and the arrival of mobile gaming
12611580	12617020	would come to mark the beginning of the end for handhelds, and this wasn't the only part of the
12617020	12628540	industry where things were changing. For many years, PC gaming had been a place of new innovations
12628540	12634380	and independent development, but by the start of the 21st century, the divide between PC gaming
12634380	12641100	and consoles wasn't quite so clear anymore. The PlayStation 1's use of PC-based development kits
12641100	12646940	made porting between computers and consoles easier than ever, and as a result, many PC developers
12646940	12652380	started to bring their games to consoles as well. This trend continued into the next generation,
12652380	12656780	as all major console players now took the importance of porting and cross-platform games
12656780	12662380	into consideration. At the same time, the console market had seen rapid growth since the launch
12662380	12668060	of the PlayStation 1, making it a more lucrative market than ever, and then Microsoft entered
12668060	12673740	the console space as well, making PC gaming and consoles even more closely connected.
12674940	12680700	The result of all this was that PC gaming wasn't really as important in the 2000s as it was in
12680700	12685740	the previous decades, and several notable PC developers started to design their games with
12685740	12693340	consoles in mind, and maybe even as a priority. One of the best examples of this is Bioware,
12693420	12698060	whose Baldur's Gate series had helped define the computer role-playing genre in the late 90s.
12698940	12704940	Then, after another PC-focused RPG in Neverwinter Night since 2002, they made Star Wars Knights of
12704940	12711020	the Old Republic for PC and Xbox, a game with a more console-focused design than earlier titles,
12711020	12717500	and then their next two games, Jade Empire and Mass Effect, continued the console-focused design
12717500	12723820	and released exclusively on Xbox and Xbox 360, while only later coming to PC.
12725260	12730860	And so, while PC games did continue to release in this period, for developers, this was a time
12730860	12737980	when consoles were often more important. The 2000s would also see certain classic PC gaming
12737980	12742860	genres start to fall out of fashion, either because of changing consumer interests,
12742940	12747980	or changing trends in game design, or just the impact of console growth over PC.
12749260	12755020	Examples include point-and-click adventure games, dungeon crawlers, turn-based RPGs,
12755020	12759820	arena shooters, certain simulation games, and even real-time strategy games.
12761020	12766700	Some series that did see substantial PC success this decade include the already mentioned Sims,
12766700	12773740	which received sequels in 2004 and 2009, the Total War series, which started with Shogun Total War
12773740	12780060	in 2000 and received four more sequels over the next ten years, and the Civilization series,
12780060	12786860	which saw its third entry in 2001 with further sequels in 2005 and 2010.
12788220	12794060	Perhaps the PC's most standout release in this period was Valve's Half-Life 2 in 2004.
12794300	12799260	Built on the studio's brand new source engine, its graphics alone were a whole generation ahead
12799260	12804300	of anything on console at the time, and when combined with the engine's advanced new physics
12804300	12809500	simulation, the game offered one of the most realistic and immersive experiences anyone had
12809500	12815900	ever seen. Still, Half-Life 2 was more than just the graphical showcase. It used its new
12815900	12820620	higher level of detail to craft effective environmental storytelling. Its physics were
12821580	12825420	incorporated into puzzle design and allowed for the addition of a new gravity gun,
12825980	12831420	and it combined varied gameplay, evocative worldbuilding, and an immersive, seamless story
12831420	12835740	to create one of the most enduring single-player FPS experiences of all time.
12836940	12841020	Half-Life 2 is one of the most highly acclaimed games of the 21st century,
12841020	12847820	and it sold over 12 million copies. At a time when big PC exclusives seemed to be dying out,
12847900	12852140	Half-Life 2 was a game which came to symbolize the system and its player base,
12853180	12856460	even if it did still release on consoles a few years later.
12857580	12863020	Still, even if the PC might have been past its golden age, there was one area where it continued
12863020	12867580	to innovate, and it was an area which was only growing in importance.
12868940	12873660	Online Online gaming may have started in the 90s,
12873660	12879580	but the 2000s was when it exploded. The biggest contributor to this was the adoption of Broadband.
12880300	12886940	In 2000, only 3% of American homes had Broadband, but by 2010, that number had increased to 66%,
12887820	12895180	and Broadband meant convenient, high-speed internet access, which was perfect for playing online games.
12895420	12903100	In 2001, Dynamix's Tribes 2 upped the scale of online shooters to a staggering 128 players
12903100	12911260	in fast-paced jetpack-fuelled action. In 2002, EA's Battlefield 1942 offered a rather different
12911260	12916860	kind of large-scale multiplayer warfare with up to 64 players in an impressive simulation
12916860	12924300	of a realistic battle. Alongside EA's Medal of Honor and Activision's Call of Duty in 2003,
12925020	12929180	these three series established the modern military shooter, something that would play a
12929180	12935340	massive part in the gaming industry for years to come. In 2004, Valve released Counter-Strike
12935340	12940940	Source, ensuring the popular round-based shooter continued to stay relevant, and in 2007,
12940940	12946380	Valve released Team Fortress 2, a class and objective-based FPS that has continued to
12946380	12952140	remain active and popular to this day. Online shooters were making their way to consoles
12952140	12957900	as early as Unreal Championship in 2002, but for many people, PC was still the best place to
12957900	12964060	experience them, with custom matchmaking, dedicated servers, and loyal communities all shaping an
12964060	12970300	experience unlike the one on the more tightly controlled consoles. But online gaming wasn't
12970300	12975420	just about shooting other people. One of the biggest trends of the decade was the growth of
12975420	12982940	massively multiplayer online RPGs, with games like Dark Age of Camelot, RuneScape, Ragnarok Online,
12982940	12987980	Final Fantasy XI, and Star Wars Galaxies all following on from what Ultima Online and EverQuest
12987980	12994220	started in the late 90s. Still, when it came to MMOs, there was one game which reigned supreme
12994220	13001660	over all others. Released in late 2004, World of Warcraft took Blizzard's popular fantasy series
13001660	13008700	online in a massive way. With a staggeringly large open world, distinct factions, classes,
13008700	13014140	and races, and more attention than previous MMOs to accessibility and leveling, World of Warcraft
13014140	13020780	quickly became hugely popular. By 2010, it was well into its second expansion and had over 12
13020780	13027580	million concurrent subscribers, all paying monthly fees. In a time before microtransactions,
13027660	13033500	loot boxes, or DLC, this represented a serious amount of continuous income on a scale which
13033500	13040140	the gaming industry had never really seen before. 12 million players also meant a serious amount of
13040140	13046540	time was being invested into Warcraft's virtual world. As more and more players followed, the
13046540	13052780	reputation of a genre as something life-consuming, addictive, and dangerous grew as those outside
13052780	13058700	the gaming community tried to make sense of this new, growing phenomenon. In reality, some of the
13058700	13064460	panic this led to was overblown, but there was an element of truth to it as well. For some people,
13064460	13071020	MMOs really were addictive. The escapist promised of another world to lose yourself in, the competitive
13071020	13075580	nature of player-vs-player combat and end-game raiding, and the social bonds that come from
13075580	13080460	spending so much time with other players in a shared world all contributed to an experience
13080460	13086380	still new to many people that could provide hours of fun, but could also be hard to turn away from.
13088140	13093340	World of Warcraft would be followed by many other MMOs, most of which took heavy inspiration from its
13093340	13099020	success, but in the end, the genre's growth didn't last, and rather than going on to conquer the
13099020	13104620	entire gaming world, the genre instead seemed to peak at the decade's end as more and more online
13104620	13110300	games started to emerge. For a time, however, World of Warcraft really did stand at the top of the
13110300	13117180	gaming world, and it became an important part of 2000's gaming culture in the process. Still,
13117180	13122380	while World of Warcraft might have been the biggest online game of the 2000s, it certainly wasn't the
13122380	13128300	only one that left a lasting mark on the industry, and in fact, it wasn't even the only one to come
13128300	13136220	from the Warcraft series. Warcraft 3 released in 2002, and was an important online game in its
13136220	13140780	own right, with an active modding and competitive scene that were aided by the game's inclusion
13140780	13146540	of a world editor. This allowed players to create custom scenarios or maps for the game,
13146540	13152220	and many of these found popularity online, but one map in particular would go a whole lot further.
13153180	13157820	Defense of the Ancients took inspiration from an earlier custom map in Starcraft,
13157820	13163100	and shifted Warcraft's more traditional RTS focus towards hero vs hero action.
13164380	13169500	Dota proved to be a big hit, and would continue to get updated over the course of the decade,
13169500	13174460	with a dedicated community being built around its competitive play, which soon started appearing
13174460	13180380	at esport events. By the end of the decade, Dota was starting to attract serious commercial
13180460	13187100	attention, and in 2009, one of its original developers, alongside the recently formed Riot Games,
13187100	13192940	would launch their own take on a standalone Dota-like experience called League of Legends.
13194220	13199980	In time, the genre's name would change from Dota-like to MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle
13199980	13205580	Arena, and in a little more time, this would become one of the most popular genres in the world.
13206540	13214140	And it all started with a single custom map for Warcraft 3. Counter-Strike and Team Fortress
13214140	13219180	were also games which started life as player-created mods, and between them, they proved that the
13219180	13224460	innovative and independent side of PC gaming, where developers could change the entire industry with
13224460	13231260	a few lines of code written in their bedroom, was still alive, even in the console-dominated 2000s.
13232220	13238540	And speaking of console domination, the mid-2000s also brought the arrival of a new generation
13238540	13243020	alongside the greatest fall from grace since the collapse of Atari.
13248780	13253260	With the PlayStation 2, Sony achieved the unthinkable, and they were set to enter the
13253260	13258940	7th generation of consoles with a huge lead in market share and a near flawless reputation
13259180	13264780	with the public. One year after the release of their next system, however, they would find
13264780	13270700	themselves firmly in last place in sales while making a significant loss on each unit sold,
13270700	13274780	with onlookers questioning if they were witnessing the beginning of the end
13274780	13281740	of the once-immortal PlayStation. For 10 years, Sony dominated the console market
13281740	13287100	without any competitor coming close. For 10 years, they looked unbeatable.
13288140	13290860	Until, suddenly, things changed.
13292780	13299980	The story of how this happened began at E3 2005. For years, gamers the world over had been
13299980	13304380	eagerly awaiting the next generation of gaming, and it was here that they were finally going to
13304380	13310460	get to see it, with Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo showing off their new consoles officially for the
13310460	13317500	very first time. For Nintendo, the reveal was still rather secretive. The console was named
13317500	13321900	The Revolution, due to Nintendo's belief that it would revolutionize the industry,
13321900	13327180	but the reason for that revolution wasn't yet made clear, and other than a look at the prototype
13327180	13331900	model, some technical details, and a brief showing of some next-generation Metroid,
13331900	13335100	the audience was ultimately left with more questions than answers.
13335500	13342540	For Microsoft, the event meant details. The already-announced Xbox 360 was set to launch
13342540	13347020	later that year ahead of its competition, and Microsoft showed off upcoming games,
13347020	13351820	provided technical specifications, and emphasized the new online interconnectivity,
13351820	13356460	with in-game messaging, downloadable games, and further online support being planned.
13357740	13363260	Sony, however, wasn't as close to their console's release date, and so the event came to be about
13363500	13371260	the future. Sony's main announcement was the Cell multi-core microprocessor that would be powering
13371260	13377900	their new upcoming system. This was being built in collaboration with IBM and Toshiba, and used
13377900	13383340	genuine supercomputer technology, making it a promising piece of hardware that could put Sony's
13383340	13389820	system a clear step above its competition in terms of pure power. Sony spent far longer showcasing
13389820	13395420	the Cell processor than any company would normally spend on such a subject, with both tech demos
13395420	13402540	and games designed to show off its capabilities. Some of what was shown was genuinely mind-blowing.
13403340	13407740	It can be hard to tell on lower-resolution video footage after years of further technological
13407740	13413980	advances, but for the time, the quality of certain games was far beyond anything people had seen
13413980	13420700	before, beyond Microsoft's recent 360 showcase, and beyond what many people thought was even possible.
13421900	13426860	For example, Killzone featured animations, physics, and lighting effects that are still
13426860	13433020	difficult to achieve today, 18 years later, including explosions casting shadows in real time.
13434220	13439020	For people who knew a little about gaming hardware, this could only mean one of two
13439020	13443580	possibilities, and arguments were quick to break out online about which one was true.
13444780	13449340	Either Sony was about to obliterate the competition and dominate a third console
13449340	13456300	generation in a row with their far superior system, or the games shown were fake,
13457580	13463340	i.e pre-rendered videos that were only posing as games, or at best actual games that were
13463340	13470620	instead running on top-of-the-line PC hardware. In the end, time would tell, but not before the
13470620	13481500	Xbox 360 launched. The 360 released in November 2005 at $299 or $399, depending on model,
13481500	13487740	and it received a positive critical reception. Sales started strong, but manufacturing problems
13487740	13492860	limited supply, leading to the system selling out in all regions except Japan, while not
13492860	13498780	selling as many units as was originally hoped. The launch lineup was nothing remarkable,
13498780	13504140	with Call of Duty 2 and Perfect Dark Zero being the best selling titles, yet Niber represented
13504140	13511100	a true system seller. And so, with one console released, the field was wide open, with everything
13511100	13518220	still to play for. 2006 saw the PlayStation 3 being delayed from its earlier release date of spring
13518220	13524060	to later in the year, while the 360 continued strong, adding more exclusive games to its library,
13524060	13529900	including the Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion, Dead Rising, and Saints Row. Meanwhile,
13529900	13536620	E3 that year brought Nintendo's big reveal, and reactions were mixed. The new name, The We,
13536620	13541980	was widely mocked, and the showcasing of the new motion controls left audiences uncertain.
13542940	13548140	For Nintendo and the gaming industry, this was a bold new direction, and no one seemed quite
13548140	13554300	sure yet what the impact of this would be. One thing it did make clear, however, was that Nintendo
13554300	13558460	wouldn't be in the competition for the most powerful next-gen system anymore, and would
13558460	13566220	instead be finding success or failure through forging their own path. And so, attention returned to
13566220	13571020	Sony, who were about to have a conference that would live in infamy ever since.
13571820	13575820	Our development teams all around the world, in all of our studios,
13575820	13581100	have been hard at work converting that technology and vision into magic.
13585580	13591820	Whoops. Another exciting aspect is the ability for consumers to make microtransactions, 599 US
13591820	13596220	dollars, and we've been digging deeper and discovering what kind of muscle this machine really has.
13599420	13603500	And you can see from all of the games that we have up and running on PlayStation 3 that we're
13603500	13610940	really starting to push what this machine is capable of. Real-time weapon change, it's exhilarating.
13613820	13617340	What they're creating for the PlayStation 3 is inspiring.
13620300	13627660	So, that sums up our playable section. When E3 began in the 90s, it was something
13627660	13632540	aimed primarily at investors and industry professionals, and it came alongside boring
13632540	13639260	PowerPoint presentations full of sales figures and bar charts. As time went by, E3 became more and
13639260	13644620	more about media coverage and consumer outreach, with it becoming the number one place to make
13644620	13652460	gaming announcements, while also drawing heavy consumer scrutiny. By 2006, E3 was starting to
13652460	13657820	attract more consumer attention, and Sony's presentation wasn't exactly convincing.
13658700	13663900	Making fun of E3 conferences has gone on to become a recurring part of online gaming culture,
13664540	13667260	but this was where that tradition started.
13667820	13669660	And we're certainly not interested in gimmicks.
13669660	13677260	So, you can position this next to your TV screen and see for yourself what is coming up behind you.
13677260	13679580	And we're certainly not interested in conventional thinking.
13680540	13686860	Genji 2 is an ashen game, which is based on Japanese history. The stages of the game will
13686860	13691900	also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
13693580	13696220	So, here's this giant enemy crab.
13696220	13704460	It's Ridge Racer. Ridge Racer. It requires huge financial investment, 599 US dollars,
13704460	13708060	but we must take risks to reap the rewards.
13708060	13713580	Still, as the dust settled, on-stage awkwardness and giant enemy crabs were the least of Sony's
13713580	13720860	worries. A retail price of 599 dollars, or 499 for a model with a smaller hard drive
13720860	13726780	and several missing features, was a staggering amount of money, well beyond the competition,
13726780	13728300	or what anyone expected.
13729500	13734060	The system would include a Blu-ray player, which helped Sony promote the Blu-ray format,
13734060	13739740	but unlike the DVD player of the PS2, for most consumers, this did little to make up for the
13739740	13744060	system's high price, as the Blu-ray format was still rarely being used at the time.
13745180	13749580	Sony, however, justified the high price on the basis that the power of their system
13749580	13756300	made it worth it. They were Sony, they made the best consoles, and the higher price was
13756300	13761980	reflective of their far more powerful hardware. Sony didn't see the problem with this logic,
13762700	13764060	but other people did.
13764380	13769820	Alongside the price, release date, and lessons on Japanese history, Sony also showcased several
13769820	13774780	upcoming games, yet most of them didn't look as impressive as what Sony had shown the year
13774780	13779500	before. What's more, they also didn't look especially different to the already released
13779500	13786060	games on the Xbox 360. Sony did have a more powerful system, but it seemed they didn't
13786060	13792060	have much to show for it. Of course, some people disagreed with arguments ranging online about
13793020	13797100	the console's graphics, and people possibly seeing whatever they wanted to see.
13798380	13805100	In the end, time would once more tell the true story, and in November 2006, the PlayStation 3
13805100	13810300	released in America and Japan, with a last-minute delay leading to the European release being
13810300	13818060	pushed to early 2007. Regardless of the price, the system did still sell, with stock shortages
13818060	13824220	and online scalpers causing controversy. The PS3 launch lineup also didn't have too much to offer,
13824220	13828460	and featured fewer games than the 360 had at release, with the best-selling game being
13828460	13834540	Resistance Full of Man. Still, by this point, the Xbox 360 had been out for a year already,
13834540	13839660	and in that time, its library had grown considerably, with the month of the PS3's launch
13839660	13845500	just happening to coincide with Microsoft's latest big exclusive, Gears of War, a third-person
13845500	13851980	shooter from Epic Games. Gears was a major critical and commercial hit. Its heavy focus on
13851980	13856780	cover-based combat was seen as a fresh take on the shooter genre, and it was the perfect game to
13856780	13863660	fill a space left open by the 360's absence of a new halo. What's more, its Unreal Engine-powered
13863660	13869740	graphics wowed critics and showcased what the 360 was capable of, and it seemed that what the 360
13869740	13875500	was capable of was keeping up with the supposedly more powerful PlayStation 3.
13876940	13882460	Of course, arguments about graphics still raged online, but by this point, for most people,
13882460	13887100	it was clear that if the PS3 did have an advantage, it wasn't a big enough one to win
13887100	13893420	them the console generation outright. At this point, you may be wondering what the hell was
13893420	13899260	going on inside the PlayStation 3, and whether the system even was more powerful to begin with,
13900060	13903660	and this was a question many people asked throughout the seventh generation.
13904700	13910700	The simple answer is that the cell processor famously used by the PS3 was more powerful,
13910700	13916300	but it was also more complicated, which made it harder for developers to actually utilize its power.
13917500	13923580	Meanwhile, the 360 had a solid CPU itself, while also having a small edge when it came to GPU power
13923580	13929260	and a more convenient shared memory system. In the end, though, any difference in power
13929260	13933260	didn't really matter. The key decider was third parties.
13934620	13938860	Sony hoped that they'd continue to lead the industry, and that developers would prioritize
13938860	13945260	developing for their more powerful system as a result. In reality, however, the Xbox 360 quickly
13945260	13950380	gained a sizable share of the market, and so developers' priority became making sure their
13950380	13955660	games were available on both systems, with some developers even going as far as to publicly
13955660	13962780	criticize Sony's more difficult to develop for hardware. But as the 360 was easier to develop
13962780	13968940	for, most multi-platform games were developed primarily for the Xbox 360 and then ported to the
13968940	13975500	PS3, meaning not only did the PlayStation 3 lack a graphical advantage, but in many multi-platform
13975500	13983180	games the PlayStation version either looked or ran worse. The PS3 did produce some great looking
13983180	13988060	exclusives, particularly later in its life once developers had more time to get used to the system's
13988060	13993580	architecture. But its reputation for having inferior versions of multi-platform games,
13993580	13997180	at a time when multi-platform games were becoming more important,
13997180	14002060	did damage the system's sales, with Microsoft often seeing much better software sales for
14002060	14008860	multi-platform titles. It also damaged Sony's brand, and without a graphical edge or many
14009100	14015340	exclusive games early in its life, the PlayStation 3 fell behind the 360, while the Xbox's library
14015340	14021980	continued to grow. 2007 brought more exclusives to Microsoft's system, including Crackdown,
14021980	14028780	Forza Motorsports 2, BioShock, and Mass Effect. The biggest of these, though, was the much
14028780	14035020	anticipated Halo 3, which promised players the chance to finish the fight in what was to be
14035020	14041980	Master Chief's final game. Halo was huge. It went on to sell over 14 million copies
14041980	14046140	in what many considered to be the best game of the 7th generation up until that point.
14047260	14051980	Sony would have some exclusives of their own that year, but the likes of a new Ratchet & Clank,
14051980	14057500	Uncharted Drake's Fortune, and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue weren't enough to match the 360's
14057500	14062620	superior offerings. What's more, many of the series that once made the PlayStation,
14062620	14070300	the console king, were going, or had already went, multi-platform. From Grand Theft Auto to Devil
14070300	14076220	May Cry, Tomb Raider, or Tekken, Sony's list of exclusives seemed to be getting smaller and smaller,
14076220	14083100	and at E3 2008, it was announced that even Final Fantasy, a series more important to Sony's early
14083100	14089900	success than any other, would be coming to both systems. Microsoft did face some of their own
14089900	14095580	problems, the most expensive being high rates of hardware failure, and the infamous Red Ring of
14095580	14101740	Death. Reports of technical problems appeared early in the 360's life, but the true extent of the
14101740	14106780	issue wasn't made apparent until a year or two after its launch, as more and more systems continued
14106780	14113100	to fail. In the end, Microsoft was forced to make an official response to the situation, alongside
14113100	14120540	offering all Xbox owners a full three-year warranty covering repairs and shipping. This was estimated
14120540	14126140	to cost over $1 billion, and slowed the Xbox's momentum at a time when Microsoft would have
14126140	14132540	loved to instead have been pulling further ahead. As the decade grew to a close, the PlayStation
14132540	14139740	3's outlook was finally starting to look more positive. Consecutive $100 price cuts in 2007,
14139740	14148380	2008, and 2009 finally brought the system to an affordable price. Several early 360 exclusives,
14148380	14154140	like the Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion and Bioshock, turned out to only have timed exclusivity and
14154140	14159420	made their way to Sony's system as well. And as the generation continued, the PlayStation 3 was
14159420	14165180	able to add more and more exclusives of its own, including LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid 4,
14165740	14174460	Killzone 2, Infamous, God of War 3, and Gran Turismo 5. Meanwhile, the exclusives on the 360
14174460	14180780	started to come slower, with highlights including Fable 2, Left 4 Dead, and sequels to Halo and
14180780	14187420	Gears of War. The decade would end with Microsoft still in the lead, but with Sony working hard to
14187420	14192540	make amends for their mistakes by taking heavy losses on systems sold after price cuts as they
14192540	14197660	tried to foster an image of appealing to core gamers and creating strong first-party titles.
14199020	14204620	Still, for Microsoft, the seventh generation can only be interpreted as victory, whereas for Sony,
14204620	14210060	they went from being untouchable to having to fight for their life. When Sony launched the
14210060	14215500	PlayStation 1, they found record success through the system's affordable price, its ease to develop
14215500	14221820	for, and its great third-party support that led to many exclusive titles. Ten years later,
14221820	14226380	they seem to have ignored all of these factors and were instead relying on name recognition to
14226380	14231340	sell their system no matter the price, and to bring developers to their side no matter the
14231340	14237340	challenge of development. Yet, while it might seem like Sony's downfall was brought about by
14237340	14243820	arrogance, it might be fairer to say that they were simply over-ambitious. The man responsible
14243820	14249740	for many of the decisions involving the PlayStation 3 was then Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO
14249740	14256300	Ken Kutaragi, who is sometimes described as the father of PlayStation. For Kutaragi,
14256300	14260780	this was to be his last direct involvement with Sony's gaming division, which was something he
14260780	14267260	had once done so much to help create, and he truly believed in the power of the cell processor and
14267260	14273740	had hopes its technology could be used in other Sony products. In the end, this wasn't to be,
14273740	14279260	but Kutaragi had taken gambles with the PlayStation 1 and 2 as well, and in the past,
14279260	14282940	this was a big part of what helped turn Sony into the leader of the industry.
14283980	14289900	This time, however, he simply got it wrong. Still, Sony weren't the only ones who took
14289900	14295740	a gamble in the 7th generation, and while the PS3 and 360 were in fierce competition for the
14295740	14299980	core gaming market, Nintendo were finding success elsewhere.
14300940	14307500	The Wii wasn't like its peers.
14308540	14314140	Where Sony and Microsoft moved to high definition, Nintendo's system remained at the 480p of the
14314140	14318940	previous generation, breaking the long-running convention of new consoles being more powerful
14318940	14325100	than their predecessors. Instead, Nintendo opted to avoid direct competition and to target a broader
14325100	14331660	demographic in what has sometimes been called the Blue Ocean business strategy, which asserts
14331660	14338140	finding value in less contested market spaces. To this end, Nintendo set out with the goal to
14338140	14343500	innovate, taking inspiration from the success of the Nintendo DS, as well as the popular arcade
14343500	14348460	rhythm game, Dance Dance Revolution, and new advancements in motion sensing technology.
14348620	14354860	The end result released in November 2006, mere days after the PlayStation 3.
14355740	14363020	Unlike the PS3, however, the Wii cost the mere $250, and it quickly sold out, beating the combined
14363020	14367740	sales of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in most regions during its launch.
14369020	14374300	The Wii offered something genuinely new, and people seemed eager to try it out for themselves.
14375260	14381100	By September 2007, the Wii had overtaken the 360, despite releasing a year later,
14381100	14385980	and it continued to sell well in 2010 when it started to experience a rapid decline
14385980	14391900	amidst increased competition. For many people though, the Wii was the perfect family console.
14392860	14397340	Its advertising targeted a wide audience, including mothers and grandmothers,
14397340	14402300	and its wealth of party games and simple pickup and playability led to many people who may not
14402380	14408380	have usually played video games being willing to give it a go. Its best-selling titles reflect
14408380	14415500	this broader appeal, with the bundled Wii Sports selling and impressive 82.9 million copies.
14416620	14421180	Wii Sports didn't receive the strongest critical reception, mostly due to the gameplay's lack of
14421180	14426460	depth, but its simplicity worked well as an introduction to motion control and as a way to
14426460	14433660	attract those new to gaming. Other new first-party motion control games like Wii Play, Wii Fit,
14433660	14439260	Wii Party, and Wii Sports Resort also sold impressive numbers, with Nintendo managing
14439260	14444300	to showcase various creative ways to use their new technology, particularly through the combination
14444300	14450780	of exercise and gaming in Wii Fit. Alongside these were many of the classic series people
14450780	14456220	have come to expect from Nintendo, with Mario Kart Wii and new Super Mario Bros Wii being the
14456220	14462300	best-selling titles, and Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Smash Bros Brawl,
14462300	14465900	and for Legends of Zelda Twilight Princess being its most highly acclaimed.
14467100	14472220	Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 stood out in particular for once more offering a fresh take on the 3D
14472220	14477420	Mario formula, this time with a space theme and lots of creative level design focused on
14477420	14483100	different uses of gravity. Much of the Wii's library focused on its motion controls however,
14483100	14488780	and on this aspect opinions varied, with some seeing it as a bold new step for gaming and
14488780	14494460	others seeing it as more of an imprecise gimmick. The legacy of the Wii is also hard to judge.
14495180	14500140	It was the best-selling system of its generation, and yet in its later years its sales fell
14500140	14506300	consistently behind both its rivals in hardware and software, and this severe loss of momentum
14506300	14511340	may have went on to hurt Nintendo's next console. For a time it looked like the system
14511340	14516780	would live up to its early codename, but in the end the motion control revolution didn't really
14516780	14521900	amount to much, suggesting that the success of the system might have been more down to novelty
14521900	14527340	than the inherent value that motion control provided. There were also problems beyond the
14527340	14533420	system's less impressive graphics, with poor online support, poor audio, and a plethora of
14533420	14538460	lower quality titles that seemed designed to purely cash in on the latest craze with little
14538460	14544780	regard to quality. This came alongside a lack of long-term third-party support from more established
14544780	14549820	video game developers, who often stated they found motion controls difficult to implement and develop
14549820	14555660	for. The Wii would also miss out on many multi-platform games due to the difficulty of porting to a
14555660	14562220	system with lower technical specifications. Yet at the same time, the Nintendo Wii was one of the
14562220	14568380	most unique and daring consoles the gaming industry has ever seen, and it remains an iconic part of
14568380	14575340	gaming in the 2000s. And while motion controls may not have been the future for mainstream gaming,
14575900	14582860	appealing to wider demographics may well have been. The 2000s would see another trend come and go
14582860	14588860	in the form of accessory-based rhythm games. Across different systems and different titles,
14588860	14595020	the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series saw hugely impressive sales, and while this sub-genre soon
14595020	14599980	fell away, this was around the same time but smartphones and mobile gaming were starting
14599980	14605420	to explode and conquer the casual market as well as a big chunk of the entire industry in the process.
14606860	14610620	In this sense, the Wii may have been ahead of its time in making inroads
14610620	14617180	into new, more casual audiences. But it would soon find itself outgunned in the great casual war
14617180	14622620	by the rapidly growing mobile market. Mobile gaming wasn't the only thing on the rise at
14622620	14627020	the end of the decade, however, as while console gaming was increasingly going big,
14627660	14630860	some developers started to take a rather different approach.
14637340	14643180	The 2000s can be seen as the decade where AAA gaming came to dominate, with bigger budgets,
14643260	14648540	better graphics and longer development cycles at the same time that certain styles or genres of
14648540	14654780	games were increasingly being pushed out of the limelight. But in the shadow of this increased
14654780	14660300	focus on blockbuster titles at the expense of all else, something else started to appear in the
14660300	14666460	decade's second half. Independent game development had long played a vital role in PC gaming,
14667420	14672380	from pioneering students in the 70s to bedroom coders in the 80s to shareware
14672380	14676860	successes in the 90s and even modding innovations at the turn of the decade,
14676860	14681100	independent development was around since the industry's beginning, and it never stopped
14681100	14687740	being important. Still, throughout the 90s and 2000s, the technological gap between what small
14687740	14694060	independent teams and big commercial studios could do grew and grew, moving the industry
14694060	14699740	further and further away from independent development. In the early 2000s, however,
14699820	14703740	several factors would align that helped give rise to a new form of indie game development.
14704780	14709580	The first was the internet, which paved the way for more effective online distribution
14709580	14715180	without the need for retailers or publishers. The internet also saw the start of browser-based
14715180	14721660	gaming, which was made possible through programs like Java and Adobe Flash. This would give rise
14721660	14726620	to a wealth of user-generated content, with hosting sites like Newgrounds seeing massive
14726620	14732060	amounts of traffic over the decades, proving the popularity of even much more limited games,
14732060	14737820	with some browser-based games quickly becoming successful enough to get full PC retail releases,
14737820	14745900	like with PopCap's 2001 match 3 game Bejewelled. At the same time as this, new dedicated software
14745900	14752780	like Game Maker Studio and new unified game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine were starting to lower
14752780	14759580	the programming barrier to entry in game development. Finally, in 2004 Half-Life 2 released,
14759580	14767100	and indie gaming would never be the same. Because despite being very far from an indie game itself,
14767100	14772700	Half-Life 2 was the first game to be offered on and required the installation of Steam.
14774220	14779420	The Half-Life community wasn't exactly happy about this, but the Half-Life community didn't
14779420	14787100	have a choice, and Half-Life 2 was a difficult game to resist. In 2005, Steam would release its first
14787100	14792620	third-party games on the platform, including independent titles like Ragdoll Kong Fu and
14792620	14799660	Darwinia. And as Steam's digital distribution model cut out retailers and manufacturing costs,
14799660	14804780	it gave developers a higher profit margin, meaning that once Valve proved the model could work,
14804780	14810620	they were able to start attracting bigger names, including id Software, Idos and Capcom,
14810620	14816220	leading to further growth for the platform. This came alongside the rise of the term
14816220	14822060	indie game. Once upon a time, there were no distinctions between games on the basis of developer
14822060	14827980	status or budget, but as the industry grew, people eventually started to differentiate between
14827980	14833900	small, cheaper, independent titles and the more traditional full-priced commercial releases.
14835180	14840620	One of the first games to help create this distinction was Cave Story, which was developed
14840620	14848300	by one man, Daisuke Amaya, over a five-year period starting when he was in college. Amaya was inspired
14848300	14854300	by the games he played growing up, like Metroid, and so he made a 2D platforming adventure game
14854300	14861340	with a retro visual style. Cave Story was finished in late 2004, with Amaya making it available
14861340	14866460	online for free. The reason he didn't charge anything was because he thought the shareware
14866460	14871900	model would be too much hassle to implement, and he just wanted more people to play his game
14871900	14878860	after working on it for so long. And people did play his game, with several western media outlets
14878860	14883580	reporting on and praising it soon after its release, and showing amazement that such a game
14883580	14890780	could come from just one single developer. But as Cave Story released for free in a time before
14890780	14896140	most people had ever heard the term indie game, it didn't find mainstream success, and Amaya
14896140	14901260	simply continued working his full-time job at a printing company until six years later when
14901260	14906060	Cave Story released on Nintendo's WiiWare service and finally became a commercial success.
14907420	14913260	Cave Story has been described as the quintessential indie game and it would inspire others to follow
14913260	14919020	in its wake, while digital distribution and new development tools made doing so more and more
14919020	14925740	achievable. The next major step for indie games would once again come from Valve and a non-indie
14925740	14933180	game however. Portal, released in 2007 and its creative puzzle design and memorable story made
14933180	14939660	it one of the year's most critically acclaimed games. Portal was only about three hours long however,
14939660	14945420	which seemed far too short for a normal full-priced commercial release. As a result,
14945420	14951340	Valve got around this by selling it alongside Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 in a retail
14951340	14958140	compilation called The Orange Box. Still, Portal's high quality and widespread popularity clearly
14958140	14963820	highlighted the potential of smaller, more focused games. At the same time as this,
14963820	14968300	Microsoft were looking to promote their own Xbox-focused digital distribution store,
14968300	14974140	Xbox Live Arcade, which was a perfect place for indie games due to their smaller download sizes.
14975100	14981340	And so, Microsoft began the Xbox Live Arcade Wednesdays program, which promised a new arcade
14981340	14987260	game to be released each week over summer, as well as the Xbox Live Arcade unplugged compilation
14987260	14994780	discs to promote Xbox Live Arcade games to normal retail consumers. This was followed by the Xbox
14994780	15000700	Live Summer of Arcade, which began in 2008 and saw Microsoft heavily promote a series of newly
15000780	15006540	releasing indie games each summer. The first year's lineup included Castle Crashers,
15006540	15013740	Bionic Commando Rearmed, Gallagher Legions, Geometry Wars 2, and Braid. And this proved
15013740	15018220	to be a big success, which helped establish the concept of indie games with general audiences.
15019340	15024220	By 2009, promising indie titles were starting to become a common occurrence even outside of
15024220	15030940	Xbox's Summer of Arcade and Steam. Spelunky, from Derrick U, combined platforming gameplay with
15030940	15036140	the procedural generation of roguelikes to create a new type of non-traditional roguelike design
15036140	15042460	that many future games would emulate. Flower, from Back Game Company, released on PSN and took
15042460	15047180	players on a calm and emotional journey that contrasted sharply from the violence of most
15047180	15053340	mainstream games. And World of Goo, from 2D Boy, released on PC and Wii and impressed with its
15053340	15060620	simple yet challenging puzzle design and memorable presentation. And so, by 2010, indie games in the
15060620	15065500	form that we think of them today had arrived and they were just starting to become an important
15065500	15077020	force within an industry that was otherwise moving in the opposite direction. At the start of the
15077020	15081980	decade, Sony were at the top of the industry and were preparing for the release of a console that
15081980	15088380	would soon be even more successful. By the end of the decade, they were in last place and trying
15088380	15093340	desperately to rebuild their damage reputation. At the start of the decade, Microsoft was still
15093340	15097740	yet to formally enter the gaming space, yet by the decade's end, they were in the strongest
15097740	15102380	position they would ever find themselves in, with the Xbox looking increasingly like the
15102380	15109180	core gaming console of choice. At the start of the decade, Nintendo were THE company for classic
15109180	15115500	console gaming, yet by its end, they were finding new levels of success by appealing to new audiences
15115500	15122140	with new types of technology. Things change fast in the gaming industry, and in just a few more
15122140	15129020	years, everything just mentioned would end up changing again. But it wasn't just the fates
15129020	15135340	of the major players that were in flux in the 2000s. Game design itself would see major evolution
15135340	15139180	as mainstream gaming moved further and further towards a triple-A approach.
15140140	15145100	The jump from the 6th to 7th console generation would be the last time that new consoles would
15145100	15151340	bring a really noticeable upgrade in graphics, as games went from 480 to 720 resolution,
15151900	15157660	but even this came at a cost, as the average frame rate of console games dropped as a result
15157660	15164460	from 60 FPS down to 30. For years, gaming graphics had steadily increased,
15164460	15169260	but now, the industry was starting to see diminishing returns, with sacrifices having to
15169260	15175660	be made to performance to make continued advancement possible. And yet, the best-selling
15175660	15180460	and most critically acclaimed games were, without doubt, the ones that looked the best.
15181500	15188220	In 2009, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 broke records for sales, and Uncharted 2 broke records
15188220	15194300	for Game of the Year awards, with both games putting a huge focus on linear cinematic set pieces
15194300	15197820	and the highest levels of presentation that technology would allow.
15198780	15204220	And yet, while mainstream gaming was getting noticeably more expensive and less diverse,
15204220	15209740	it was other areas of gaming that would see the largest growth. At the end of 2009,
15209740	15215740	rovio entertainment's Angry Birds and Pop Caps, Plants vs Zombies had just released,
15215740	15220460	as smartphone-fuelled mobile gaming was becoming a larger and larger section of the industry.
15221260	15226220	Sony and Microsoft were both preparing for the release of their own motion-controlled devices
15226220	15231500	to try to replicate Nintendo's success with casual audiences, and a little indie game by
15231500	15236940	the name of Minecraft was starting to make waves online after its first release to the public,
15236940	15241980	while a little multiplayer game called League of Legends was just coming to the end of its beta.
15243180	15249660	Gaming was changing, just like it always does, and the changes of the next decade
15249660	15256300	would see some of the industry's toughest challenges yet, alongside some of its best and worst moments.
15263260	15268940	The console wars would continue in the 2010s, but the first battle was fought over motion controls.
15269900	15273980	Nintendo had responded to criticism of the original Wii Remote's poor precision
15273980	15280940	with the Wii Motion Plus in 2009. This new add-on upped the accuracy, but only in games developed
15280940	15285900	with it in mind, and it would be required for certain later titles like Wii Sports Resort
15285900	15291900	and The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword. Still, both Sony and Microsoft focused their marketing
15291900	15295180	on why their new devices were better than the Wii.
15303980	15308460	Sony boasted about their accuracy, pointing to the little glowing plastic ball on the end of
15308460	15313820	the PlayStation Move Remote as proof that the device is special, and making liberal use of
15313820	15320300	terms like accelerometer, inertial sensors, synergistic processing units, and internal
15320300	15324860	magnetometers. And no, I did not make any of both terms up just now.
15326060	15330780	Microsoft, on the other hand, decided the best marketing strategy was to freak everyone out
15330780	15335100	with their surreal virtual child simulator, Project Milo, in 2009.
15361740	15372460	Unfortunately, while it may have apparently worked that day, one year later, when Microsoft
15372460	15376780	returned to showcase the Kinect again, it was rather less impressive, being something more
15376780	15381980	in line with the earlier PlayStation Eye toy. Meanwhile, the child Milo was never seen again.
15383260	15388300	For gaming fans that were happy using normal controllers, this was a strange time to be alive.
15389260	15395100	Both E3 and gaming media were dominated by the new upcoming battle for motion control supremacy.
15395980	15401660	For a time, the question of who would win between Kinect, the Move, and the Wii was treated with
15401660	15406860	the utmost importance, as if we were only now about to see the real battle that would determine
15406860	15412380	gaming's future. In the end, though, it turned out gaming's future had other plans.
15413340	15418780	The PlayStation Move, released in September 2010, received positive reviews for accuracy
15418780	15423980	and responsiveness, particularly when compared to the Wii, and then produced disappointing sales,
15423980	15428380	as the more serious gaming audience Sony were targeting at the time showed little interest.
15429260	15433500	A disappointing selection of games to support it certainly didn't help either,
15433500	15435980	and in three years' time, it was all but forgotten.
15436140	15443020	Microsoft's Kinect, on the other hand, released in November 2010 for a higher price and received
15443020	15447420	worse reviews, and then it broke the world records for the fastest-selling consumer
15447420	15453020	electronic device, while easily surpassing the Move in the process, probably because it was
15453020	15457740	marketed heavily towards a more casual audience and the controller-free experience it offered
15457740	15464300	was something different to the already widespread Wii. Reviewers criticised input lag and the lack
15464300	15469980	of depth in games on offer, but did praise the Kinect's innovativeness. Three years later,
15469980	15476140	and the Kinect was far from forgotten, but we'll get to that later. Around this time,
15476140	15480620	the Wii would also see its sales slow, as the motion control craze seemed to be coming to
15480620	15486700	its natural conclusion after the novelty started to wear off. Still, while motion control might
15486700	15490860	have dominated the news at that time, something else was dominating sales.
15491340	15496700	In 2009, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 broke sales records for biggest entertainment launch
15496700	15504300	in history, across all media. In 2010, Call of Duty Black Ops broke the same records,
15504300	15511020	surpassing Modern Warfare 2. In 2011, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 broke records again,
15511020	15516860	surpassing Black Ops, and in 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 broke records again,
15517020	15523740	surpassing Modern Warfare 3. Call of Duty's reign of terror would not last forever,
15523740	15530300	but at the start of the 2010s, it certainly seemed like it might. Put simply, Call of Duty was the
15530300	15535740	biggest thing in gaming at the time, with release after release, easily managing to sell over 20
15535740	15542620	million copies, and there was a new release every single year. The multiplayer formula established
15542620	15548300	by Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare proved incredibly popular with players, and Activision was happy
15548300	15554380	to do everything they could to cash in on this. And so, in a time when there was less online
15554380	15561900	shooter competition, Call of Duty became the undisputed king. Amidst the soaring popularity of
15561900	15567900	mobile games, the yearly domination of Call of Duty, and the newly arriving motion control devices,
15567900	15573900	there was a sense at this time that older, or core gaming audiences, might be being left behind
15573900	15578940	in an industry that didn't seem to need them anymore. This would play a major role in the
15578940	15583980	next console generation, but there were still well-received games being released in this period,
15583980	15588540	and amongst them, a new trend was on the rise. The Open World
15589660	15594380	After the record success of Grand Theft Auto on the PlayStation 2, it's no surprise that more
15594380	15599580	games would try to copy its approach to Open World design, but while the 2000s would see a large
15599580	15605740	number of Grand Theft Auto clones, few of them ended up leaving a lasting impact. Things would
15605740	15610300	change at the start of the next decade, however, as developers started to look beyond Grand Theft
15610300	15618940	Auto for Open World inspiration. Games like Fallout 3 in 2008, Assassin's Creed II in 2009, Red Dead
15618940	15626060	Redemption and Fallout New Vegas in 2010, Batman, Arkham City and the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim in 2011,
15626060	15632460	and Far Cry 3 in 2012 all achieved critical and commercial success to help popularise the
15632460	15637580	Open World as a concept that would soon come to be used more broadly in mainstream game design.
15638780	15643980	And as the decade continued, more and more games made the transition to Open World,
15644060	15650460	including most of the biggest series in gaming, like Metal Gear Solid, The Witcher, Dragon Age,
15650460	15658540	Final Fantasy, Mass Effect, Forza, The Legend of Zelda, Halo and Pokemon, alongside many of the
15658540	15666060	decade's biggest new IPs. This fit the established gaming industry trends of trying to make bigger
15666060	15671180	and better games to continually one up what came before, where Open World seemed to represent
15671180	15675980	the next step in this while also providing an opportunity to breathe new life into established
15675980	15681980	franchises. The move towards Open World brought benefits like increased immersion and player
15681980	15687340	freedom, but it would also lead to criticism about repetition and game experiences being drawn out
15687340	15692620	or padded, with the term Open World Fatigue sometimes being used as the decade continued.
15693820	15699020	Still, at the start of the decade, Open Worlds were relatively fresh, and early examples like
15699020	15703500	Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim were some of the most highly praised and best-selling games
15703500	15709420	of their respective years. Still, while much of gaming at this time was moving in certain
15709420	15714380	recognizable directions, there were two games which stood out for doing something different.
15715660	15722540	The first was Dark Souls, which released in 2011 on consoles and 2012 on PC.
15722780	15728220	From Software had already impressed players with Demon's Souls in 2009, but Dark Souls was where
15728220	15732940	they would reach a much wider audience, and the game quickly developed a reputation for its high
15732940	15739340	difficulty and unforgiving design. What really made Dark Souls stand out however was how different
15739340	15745340	it felt from so many other games of its era. Since the days of arcades, video games had been
15745340	15750620	becoming easier and more accessible year after year, to the point where increasing accessibility
15750860	15758060	was seen as a fundamental part of good game design. The general consensus was that older
15758060	15764380	games were often far too punishing, so developers added things like regenerating health and regular
15764380	15771580	checkpoints. Or that old games were too vague and confusing, so developers added more tutorials,
15771580	15778380	guidance, and features like mini-maps. Or that old games were too simple and video-gamey,
15778380	15783740	so developers focused more on the cinematic side with action set pieces and cutscenes.
15784940	15792540	And then, Dark Souls came along and ignored all of this. It punished players for mistakes,
15792540	15798220	even taking away their valuable experience points. It gave players minimal direction and made a world
15798220	15804380	where it was easy to get lost, and it told its story almost entirely indirectly, leaving 99%
15804460	15810620	of the experience as pure gameplay. Dark Souls broke all the rules about how a modern game
15810620	15816940	should be designed, and in doing so, it created something unique which many players fell in love
15816940	15823020	with. With time, Dark Souls developed one of the most enduring legacies of any game from the
15823020	15829660	modern era, although its reception at release was more modest. It was only the 32nd highest
15829660	15836940	reviewed game from 2011, and it was widely ignored by Game of the Year awards. Yet, it was also a
15836940	15843020	game which people kept playing and talking about, and soon its influence was hard to deny. Every
15843020	15848540	difficult game would come to be compared to it. Countless indie games would directly copy it,
15848540	15854380	and even mainstream games would start to indirectly copy it, all while its reputation kept growing.
15854620	15860860	In short, from combat design, to the lack of handholding, to the use of difficulty, or its
15860860	15866220	approach to storytelling, Dark Souls was a title which made the industry re-evaluate what good
15866220	15873420	game design truly meant, and yet, it arguably wasn't even the most important game released that year.
15874860	15877660	If Dark Souls challenged how people fought about game design,
15878220	15883420	Minecraft challenged how people fought about video games. Beginning at the hands of a single
15883420	15888940	developer, Marcus Notch Pearson, Minecraft would go on to become the best-selling game of all time,
15888940	15895020	with a staggering 238 million copies sold, a number which is still rising.
15896380	15902220	Notch took inspiration from the ambitious ColonySim, Dwarf Fortress, and the block-based mining game
15902220	15907980	Infiniminer to create a procedurally generated block-building sandbox that was made available
15907980	15913420	to the public online in 2009, and received regular updates over the next two years.
15914780	15921500	In 2011, it received its official release, and in 2014, Minecraft was bought by Microsoft for
15921500	15928620	$2.5 billion, with the game still receiving regular updates to this day. Beyond simply being one of
15928620	15934380	the most played games ever made, Minecraft popularized the concept of early access, where players
15934380	15939260	paid to access a game that's still in development, and continuous development, where a game is
15939260	15945340	continually expanded over time with no specific planned ending. It also challenged the perceived
15945340	15950860	importance of graphics in gaming. For years, graphics had been getting better and better,
15950860	15956380	and becoming a larger and larger priority, even as this caused development time and costs to
15956380	15962780	continually increase. Then, Minecraft came along with pixelated blocky visuals that looked
15962780	15967180	several generations old, and became the most successful game in history.
15968460	15974300	In doing so, Minecraft proved that not only are high quality graphics not needed for a game to be
15974300	15981500	successful, but also that graphics might sometimes be holding gaming back. Minecraft's popularity
15981500	15986780	was a result of the freedom it provided players to create and explore and do more than most other
15986780	15992140	games allowed, and this level of freedom was only made possible by the simpler visual style,
15992140	15997420	where not every asset needed thousands and thousands of polygons or multiple dedicated artists.
15998620	16003660	At a time when the gaming industry was fully embracing AAA design and indie games were still
16003660	16010620	finding their footing, Minecraft was a monumental statement about what video games could and maybe
16010620	16018460	should be. And between Minecraft, Dark Souls, the open world trend, yearly call of duties,
16018460	16023820	and unwanted motion controls, you have a great representation of what the next decade in gaming
16023820	16030700	would be all about. Video games were changing just like they always were, but now conflicts and
16030700	16035660	divisions were starting to be more obvious as the industry continued to grow and expand.
16036700	16041900	Within this, multiple distinct battles can be identified, like mainstream versus indie,
16042460	16049820	conventional game design versus counterculture, core gaming versus casual, maximizing monetization
16049820	16056140	versus preserving a franchise, and so on. And it was these divisions that would truly define
16056140	16060540	the next decade, including the next generation of console warfare.
16060780	16070220	In the 7th generation, Sony shocked the world by losing.
16071260	16077980	After years of PlayStation domination, Sony looked unstoppable, but a high price,
16077980	16082860	complicated system architecture, and the loss of key exclusives allowed Microsoft to close the
16082860	16087900	gap with core gamers while Nintendo thrived for appealing to new and more casual audiences.
16088860	16092140	The fate of all three of these companies would soon change though,
16092140	16095340	and this started before the next generation even arrived.
16096540	16102620	After years of leading the pack, the Wii sales fell behind both the 360 and PS3 at the same time
16102620	16106860	that new motion control competition arrived and consumer interest seemed to wane.
16107980	16113900	Microsoft saw its lead over Sony dwindle and eventually disappear as the 360 lost momentum
16113980	16119980	amidst few new exclusives, and Sony's system saw its finest years after price cuts and model
16119980	16125980	revisions turned around sales. Sony's strong end to the generation would be complete with the release
16125980	16132620	of The Last of Us in summer 2013, which was heralded as one of the finest games of the generation,
16132620	16138140	at the same time that the PS3 finally managed to overtake the 360's total lifetime sales.
16138140	16144540	Focus then turned to the next generation, which had officially begun in 2012.
16169100	16177260	This was the world first reveal of Nintendo's new console as shown at E3 2011.
16178460	16181900	You may notice a heavy emphasis on the word controller.
16182860	16188700	This trailer is 3 minutes long and that word shows up on screen 12 different times.
16189900	16195340	The word console isn't used once and the Wii U console isn't even shown.
16195340	16201980	The Wii U was one of Nintendo's greatest failures and much of that failure is often said to be down
16201980	16208460	to consumers failing to understand what the system even was. Looking at the reveal trailer shows how
16208460	16215260	this might have happened and even among gaming media this caused some confusion. Amongst general
16215260	16221020	consumers who may not follow gaming news closely, i.e. much of the Wii's new player base, it would
16221020	16227180	have been easy to mistake this device as just an expensive add-on or a new Nintendo themed tablet
16227180	16234220	and this poor marketing decision surely hurt the system's sales. This isn't the whole story however
16234220	16239500	and even during its development the Wii U experienced a bit of an identity crisis that went on to
16239500	16246860	follow it for the rest of its life. The Wii exceeded Nintendo's expectations and excelled with casual
16246860	16252300	gamers but Nintendo started to worry that if they appealed too much to casual audiences it might hurt
16252300	16258620	their reputation with more core audiences. As a result, Nintendo made bridging the gap between
16258620	16265180	the two groups a priority for their next system and so they decided on HD graphics as this was
16265180	16270700	expected from core audiences and that it should also include a new innovative feature that could
16270700	16277740	appeal to families and Wii fans hence the tablet like controller. This controller wasn't as
16277740	16282540	revolutionary as the Wii's motion controller bin though as tablet computers were already gaining
16282540	16289820	popularity at this time. The controller was also heavy and bulky in design, had a short battery life
16289820	16295340	and needed to be in range of the Wii U console to be used making it more limited than an actual tablet.
16296540	16299980	Nintendo also struggled to show off the advantages this hybrid approach brought to
16299980	16305740	game design whereas the Wii's motion control was simple to understand and easily demonstrated.
16307180	16315580	Still, in November 2012 the Wii U launched to the public for $299 or $349. The critical
16315580	16320780	reception was mostly positive with praise given to its backwards compatibility with Wii games and
16320780	16327020	peripherals as well as the potential of its unique controller. Initial sales were lower than Nintendo
16327020	16332540	expected though and the launch lineup had few must-play titles with the best sellers being a new
16332540	16339580	new Super Mario Bros and the party game Nintendo Land. As time went on Nintendo would release more
16339580	16345100	games on the system including new entries into most of the series people expected like Mario Kart
16345100	16349580	and Smash Bros although the importance of these games may have been diminished by the fact that
16349580	16356220	many also released on Nintendo's latest handheld the 3DS. The Wii U's biggest problem however would
16356220	16362780	once again be third party support. At the start of the Wii U's life it was on par with the still
16362780	16369500	current PS3 and Xbox 360 meaning titles could be ported between these systems and these ports made
16369500	16375180	up a big part of the Wii U's early lineup. These games rarely made interesting use of the Wii U's
16375180	16380060	unique controller and sometimes ran worse than the older generation versions due to differences
16380060	16384860	with the system's hardware but this was still a lot better than what was to follow.
16386300	16391020	Once the next generation of consoles arrived the Wii U once again became technically inferior
16391020	16395900	to its rivals causing great difficulty for third parties when porting multi-platform games to the
16395900	16402220	system and as the Wii U got off to a slow start which led to a small user base third parties
16402220	16408060	then had even less incentive to bring their games to the system at all. Less than one year after its
16408060	16414460	release EA and Bethesda both publicly stated that they had little plans for future Wii U games and
16414460	16420620	this problem only grew over time. By the end of the Wii U's life the only game amongst its best
16420620	16427340	selling titles that didn't come directly from Nintendo was Minecraft and so for the fourth
16427340	16433420	generation in a row Nintendo's console was the worst place to be for third party games and this
16433420	16439500	time the problem was bigger than ever. Nintendo designed the Wii U as a system that would appeal
16439500	16445260	to both casual and core audiences but with little third party support and few games which made
16445260	16451020	interesting use of the controller the Wii U failed to pull in many core gamers and with confusing
16451020	16456460	marketing a high price and the lack of a strong new gimmick it failed to replicate the Wii success
16456460	16464140	with casual gamers and so the Wii U was a complete failure and dumped Nintendo firmly into last place
16464140	16471100	as soon as its competitors arrived. But as disappointing for Nintendo as this must have been
16471100	16476220	at least they could soon console themselves but they weren't the only one who dropped the ball
16476220	16480780	in the eighth generation. Introducing Xbox One.
16506780	16531580	To understand how the eighth generation was won you have to keep in mind what had been happening
16531580	16536860	leading up to it. The biggest trends over the last five or six years had been the success of
16536860	16542540	the Wii and motion control, the huge growth in the mobile market and call of duty continuing
16542540	16549180	to break every sales record under the sun. People may not have admitted it but the truth was core
16549180	16555020	gamers were starting to feel like they were being forgotten. The industry was growing but it was
16555020	16559340	growing away from what made many people like games in the first place and the only thing big
16559340	16564380	company seemed to care about now was finding new ways to reach the more lucrative casual market.
16565660	16571260	And so as the next generation was about to be revealed there was never a more important moment
16571260	16579340	to put the focus squarely back on high quality games. Then came the official Xbox One reveal show
16579900	16585100	which was the first look at Microsoft's new system and a moment Xbox fans had been waiting for
16585100	16595820	for years and the only thing being mentioned was TV. It took 33 minutes almost all of which was
16595820	16602380	focused on TV before a single video game was shown and when it was it was just a highlight reel for
16602380	16608620	the next yearly installment of multi-platform EA sports titles. This was followed by the more
16608620	16616380	promising Forza 5 then a newly announced confusing game TV show hybrid called Quantum Break and then
16616380	16622780	it was back to actual TV coverage. Halo made an appearance as a newly announced TV show,
16623340	16629260	Steven Spielberg made an appearance to talk about TV, American football made an appearance as something
16629260	16634620	you can apparently watch on TV and then the show finished with Microsoft's biggest reveal.
16635580	16644300	Call of Duty will appear on Xbox later that year just as it had for the last six years because
16644300	16651660	it was a multi-platform yearly series and then the show was over. This was how Microsoft threw away
16651660	16658380	all the goodwill they had slowly built with core audiences over the last 10 years. At a time when
16658380	16663180	gamers were worried about how the industry was changing Microsoft used the one moment where
16663180	16669660	everyone was watching them to prove that all of people's fears were true. The reception to this
16669660	16677260	reveal was universally negative but things would soon get a whole lot worse. Three weeks later at
16677260	16683180	E3 2013 Microsoft had one last chance to make a big impression before their system's release
16684220	16690300	and the show ended up dominated by news that the Xbox One would be an always online system
16690300	16694940	that owners couldn't play games on it without an internet connection but people could no longer
16694940	16701260	sell or share used games due to new DRM measures and that the built-in Kinect would be always on,
16701260	16706700	watching you, recording your daily activities for storage in Microsoft database in case of any
16706700	16712860	future bad behaviour. That last part may have been added more by the public than Microsoft
16712860	16718220	themselves and Microsoft were a little unfortunate to be holding their press conference one week
16718220	16723260	after Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing unlawful surveillance by global security agencies.
16724220	16727820	Still for the most part Microsoft did it to themselves.
16743260	16747180	At this point victory was being handed to Sony on a silver platter
16747180	16751020	and all they had to do was mention video games a few times
16751020	16754300	and remind people that at least they're not Microsoft.
16755260	16761500	In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4 were equally focused on
16761500	16767820	delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.
16768700	16774460	For instance PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PS4 gamers.
16781340	16782380	Guess that's a good thing.
16784780	16790380	We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.
16790940	16796940	Just heard you there. When a gamer buys a PS4 disc they have the rights to use that copy of the game.
16796940	16803500	They can trade in the game at retail sell it to another person lend it to a friend or keep it forever.
16815660	16821500	In addition PlayStation 4 disc based games don't need to be connected online to play.
16827340	16839500	And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.
16841980	16844620	Sony's best announcement was still to come however.
16845260	16851500	I'm very proud to announce that PlayStation 4 will be available at $399.
16857660	16864540	This meant the PlayStation 4 would be $100 cheaper than the Xbox One and it wasn't
16864540	16870300	because of less powerful hardware. In fact if anything the PlayStation 4 seemed to be the most
16870300	16875980	powerful system. The reason for the Xbox's higher price was the built-in connect device
16875980	16880540	a feature but offered several benefits yet was highly disliked by many in gaming communities.
16881660	16885580	For Microsoft the reveal and its follow-up were a disaster.
16886540	16891180	One week after E3 they announced that the new DRM policy would be scrapped,
16891180	16895740	that the system would no longer require an internet connection and that owners would even be allowed
16895740	16901820	to unplug the connect and still use the console. President of Microsoft's interactive entertainment
16901820	16907420	business Von Matrick departed shortly after but by this point the damage was already done
16907420	16913980	and the high price still remained. In November 2013 both consoles released to the public with
16914060	16919980	the PlayStation 4 quickly selling out. By the end of the year it had sold 1.2 million more units
16919980	16925820	than the Xbox One and with time this lead grew until in 2015 Microsoft announced that they would
16925820	16931340	no longer be publishing sales figures. Microsoft may have hoped that after the release of the
16931340	16937180	Xbox One their reputation might improve due to the quality of the system but unfortunately for them
16937180	16942700	this too was not to be because while the two consoles were similar in specs and architecture
16942700	16947260	it was the PlayStation 4 which seemed to have the edge and was consistently performing better
16947260	16952700	when it came to multi-platform games. For Microsoft there was little they could do but
16952700	16962220	dig in repair their damaged reputation and prepare for the future. At E3 2014 they revealed a $399
16962220	16967900	connect free version of the console to bring the system in line with the PlayStation. The TV focused
16967900	16973260	Xbox entertainment studios was also closed later that year and focus for the future shifted
16973260	16979020	more towards video games with Microsoft purchasing several studios including Mojang the creators
16979020	16983900	of Minecraft which Microsoft continued to allow on Sony systems in what they hoped would be seen
16983900	16991100	as a pro consumer move. For Sony their lead over both Microsoft and Nintendo never seemed to be
16991100	16997180	any doubt and while in time Microsoft did succeed at distancing themselves from past controversies
16997180	17001980	the PlayStation 4 continued to be a well-received and well-liked system that offered a far more
17001980	17009660	impressive list of exclusive titles. This lineup was admittedly slow to get going but later included
17009660	17017020	Marvel's Spider-Man, God of War, Uncharted 4, The Last of Us Part 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghosts of
17017020	17024380	Tsushima, Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Bloodborne. Meanwhile the Xbox One had few highly reviewed
17024380	17031500	exclusives outside of Halo, Years of War and Forza. Still by this point exclusive titles played a much
17031500	17036060	smaller role in determining a console's fate than they had in the past with most games being
17036060	17041740	multi-platform and with console exclusives increasingly being released on PC by all parties
17041740	17048540	except Nintendo. There can be no mistake however that the PlayStation 4 won the eighth generation.
17049260	17055980	The most recent sales figures show that Sony's system sold over 117 million units which is more
17055980	17063660	than twice as many as the Xbox One and vastly more than the 13.5 million of the Wii U. For Nintendo
17063660	17069740	the battle was lost before it even began. For Microsoft, inferior multi-platform performance,
17069740	17074220	few exclusives and a higher launch price are what ultimately doomed the Xbox One
17074220	17079340	although the damage done by the poor handling of the initial reveal and the heavy focus on TV
17079340	17082700	made sure that the system got off to the worst possible start.
17084380	17089740	Microsoft had found some success at targeting casual audiences with the release of the Kinect in
17089740	17095420	2010 and they presumably hoped to continue this by including the Kinect with their new console and
17095420	17101660	focusing heavily on multimedia. We wanted to bring new audiences into Xbox. People that were outside
17101660	17105980	of what traditionally was thought of as our core gaming audience that was really the intent at the time.
17106620	17111820	Within the company there's always a sense of do more and grow but I think Don was looking for like
17111820	17118140	what's that next big leap after Kinect and I think there was a sense that TV could be that thing.
17118140	17122460	Like Nintendo finding that the Wii U had to compete with real tablets though,
17122460	17128060	smart TVs were also readily available by the time the Xbox One launched which made much of the
17128060	17134060	system's multimedia utility less impressive. Their biggest mistake however was simply failing
17134060	17140460	to consider their core audience when designing their system and marketing it. If they'd focused on
17140460	17145980	TV in addition to video games the reaction wouldn't have been so negative but instead
17145980	17151980	all they had to show alongside their TV related announcements were anti-consumer features like
17151980	17158380	Always Online and DRM and a high price that was a result of a feature most people didn't even want.
17159820	17165340	When gamers were worried about being abandoned by the industry Microsoft did exactly that
17165980	17174860	and it cost them. Still like others before them Microsoft and Nintendo were down but not out
17174860	17180300	and things do change quickly in gaming as the rest of the industry was making clear.
17182940	17191900	When the DS and PSP went head to head in the mid-2000s Nintendo was the clear winner but the
17191900	17196860	PlayStation portable was far from a failure and as the next generation of handhelds was revealed
17196860	17202460	at the start of the 2010s it looked like history might repeat with both companies sticking to a
17202460	17208860	similar approach. Sony doubled down on power boasting of near PlayStation 3 level graphics
17208940	17214540	and Nintendo introduced a new unique feature to complement their dual screen design by way of
17214540	17221740	stereoscopic 3D. This is something Nintendo had been flirting with for years. First with the Japan
17221740	17228620	only Famicom 3D system in the 80s then with the universally panned virtual boy in the 90s and even
17228620	17235900	with an unreleased LCD attachment for the GameCube in the early 2000s. This time however 3D was the
17235900	17241340	main attraction and with a relatively low cost and no need for additional glasses it was a feature
17241340	17251420	that got people talking. The Nintendo 3DS released in March 2011 for $250. Reviews were positive
17251420	17256380	with praise given to the addition of a new circle pad analog controller, backwards compatibility
17256380	17262140	with DS games and the improved user interface while criticism was directed towards low battery life.
17263100	17268860	The main talking point though was unsurprisingly the 3D effect with reactions varying widely
17268860	17274860	and these reactions were more important than usual as the 3D effect didn't pick up on camera making
17274860	17281020	it hard for Nintendo to show off. Still some people were blown away by the effect, some saw it as
17281020	17287820	nothing but a gimmick and some complained about it inducing nausea and headaches. It also required
17287900	17293500	rather precise positioning of the system or the effect with blur which was a little impractical
17293500	17300220	for a handheld device. The 3D effect did at least make the system stand out to something new but
17300220	17305660	in the end this didn't translate well to sales with Nintendo struggling to sell many units outside
17305660	17313180	Japan leading to a surprise price cut of $70 only four months after launch. After this sales increased
17313180	17317980	but it was a significant sacrifice for Nintendo to make just to get the device off the ground.
17319260	17324780	The PlayStation Beta on the other hand launched at the end of 2011 in Japan and in February 2012
17324780	17331900	outside Japan meaning it took almost one year longer to release than its rival. Its price of $250
17331900	17338860	put it in line with the 3DS's launch price but behind its updated price. Reviews for Sony system
17338860	17345740	were also positive with the improved performance, impressive display, rear touchpad and second analog
17345740	17350460	stick all helping to make the system stand out as a significant step up from the original PlayStation
17350460	17356860	portable. The main criticism was the memory card requirements which created an additional and
17356860	17361420	necessary further cost that was made worse by the fact that only Sony brand memory cards worked
17361420	17367100	with the device meaning users had no choice but to buy Sony's expensive cards even if they already
17367100	17373100	owned other memory cards. Still the Vita did its best to get off to a strong start and boasted a
17373100	17378700	relatively big launch lineup of 25 titles which was more than most consoles or handhelds in this
17378700	17387260	era. Those games included Uncharted Golden Abyss, Wipeout 2048, FIFA 12 and Rayman Origins.
17388300	17392540	The Vita's first year would also see more major releases such as Little Big Planet,
17392540	17399100	Persona 4 Golden, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation and Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified as Sony
17399100	17404700	tried hard to establish the system's reputation with core gamers. At first this looked like it
17404700	17410220	might work with the Vita seeing promising sales at launch but these numbers soon declined and by
17410220	17418300	the end of 2012 it had only sold 4 million units well below Sony's expectations and with slow sales
17418300	17422940	came a loss of interest from many third-party studios causing Sony to abandon their strategy
17422940	17427980	of trying to sell the system through big releases and instead adopt a more indie-centric approach
17427980	17432780	where they reached out to mobile and PC developers to try to bring as many promising smaller titles
17432780	17439980	to the platform as possible. In August 2013 Sony also dropped the price by $50 alongside a reduction
17439980	17444780	in memory cards and in conjunction with the more successful indie focus and the system's strong
17444780	17451180	sales in Japan the Vita was able to survive but it never came close to matching its predecessor
17451180	17458620	or the 3DS. As for Nintendo they would launch an updated 3DS Excel model in summer 2012 followed
17458620	17464220	by a model without the 3D display named the 2DS one year later followed by a new more powerful
17464220	17471580	version called the New 3DS in late 2014. Alongside Nintendo's characteristic strong first-party
17471580	17476940	lineup and decent third-party support from companies like Square Enix, Konami and Capcom
17476940	17481900	this helped keep sales far beyond the Vita. The 3DS would even see the release of a new
17481900	17486300	Monster Hunter game from Capcom which had long been one of the PSP's best-selling series.
17487340	17493500	Still as dominant as the 3DS was over the Vita it still fell far short of the original DS
17493500	17501180	with less than half of its total lifetime sales. The reality was that both the 3DS and Vita were
17501180	17507020	solid handheld devices that made significant improvements on their predecessors. The 3DS's
17507020	17512220	much-tounted 3D struggled to prove its value in the long term with many players simply turning
17512220	17516700	it off for most games once the novelty wore off and the Vita shot itself in the foot with
17516700	17522140	how it handled memory cards but in a different era it's easy to imagine both systems finding
17522140	17528940	strong commercial success. Still in the end it wasn't a different era and in the 2010s the
17529020	17533100	3DS and Vita combined wouldn't even come close to matching the mobile market.
17534300	17538380	The harsh reality was that in a world where most people already had smartphones
17538380	17545660	dedicated handhelds simply seemed to have too much competition and so for Sony and Nintendo
17545660	17552140	this would be the final handheld generation. Nintendo dominated the handheld market for decades
17552140	17556620	often with a staggering market share but nothing lasts forever.
17557260	17562540	As for mobile gaming it revealed an entirely different side of the industry
17562540	17567340	one with different monetization models, different games and different dominant regions.
17568380	17573020	For most observers of this the biggest takeaway was the industry's size and growth.
17574140	17579740	At the start of the 2010s the mobile industry was still well behind consoles or PC but as the
17579740	17585340	decade continued it soon caught up and by the decade's end it was considerably larger than
17585340	17592620	all other types of gaming combined. Most mobile games made money through in-app purchases or in-app
17592620	17597740	advertising rather than the more traditional buy-to-play model and the amount of money individual
17597740	17605020	games could make was staggering. The game with the highest revenue was Arena of Valor also known as
17605020	17611260	Honor of Kings in China which is a MOBA made by Chinese gaming giant Tencent that's brought in
17611260	17620540	over $14.6 billion since its release in 2015. If numbers that large seem a bit abstract to you
17620540	17626780	I like to use the currency called the Bethesda. Microsoft bought Bethesda and the IPs for $7.5
17626780	17634220	billion so Arena of Valor's revenue is about 2 Bethesdas. Other high grossing mobile games of
17634220	17641100	the decade include the RPG physics game hybrid Monster Strike, Supercell's fantasy themed strategy
17641100	17648300	game Clash of Clans, the Battle Royale focused PUBG Mobile, the match 3 RPG hybrid Puzzle and
17648300	17655900	Dragons, the more traditional match 3 game Candy Crush Saga and Pokemon Go, an augmented reality
17655900	17660300	based Pokemon game from Neantic that received a lot of mainstream attention during its release in
17660300	17668540	2016 for its unparalleled ability at making gamers touch grass. It also caused Nintendo's stock to
17668540	17675980	increase by 50% in the space of a week. It can be difficult to talk about mobile games without the
17675980	17681260	conversation eventually leading back to money whether it's the growth of the industry, the revenue
17681260	17687260	of individual games or the methods of monetization that are commonly used. Still for many people
17687260	17691420	mobile gaming is about the convenience of games that can be played in short bursts
17691420	17697660	wherever you happen to be with little barrier of entry. As the industry is growing to be so large
17697660	17702380	it's developed a lot of choice and diversity and as smartphones have continued to become more
17702380	17707820	powerful what can be achieved on them has increased at the same time. In the end though
17707820	17712780	regardless of people's various opinions on mobile gaming it's impossible to deny the industry
17712780	17718780	significance particularly as the trends seen in the mobile industry would soon make their way into
17718780	17729900	the gaming mainstream. Online gaming has been steadily growing since the early 90s and the
17729900	17736380	2010s were no exception. What would change this decade though was the way online games made money.
17737580	17742540	World of Warcraft was a hugely important game not just because it had 12 million active players
17742540	17746620	but because those 12 million players were each paying a monthly subscription fee.
17747660	17752940	Compared to a more traditional one-time purchase monthly fees were massive but when it came to
17752940	17760140	further monetization this was only the beginning. The one-time purchase business model didn't fit
17760140	17765820	well with online games that were being continually updated and emphasized long-term engagement and
17765820	17772460	so change was inevitable. One of the earliest and most significant examples was Team Fortress 2
17773020	17776860	which maintained a steady active player base after its release in 2007
17776860	17783340	while receiving regular free updates adding additional content. In 2010 one such update
17783340	17789900	allowed players to buy and sell in-game items like hats and the game's revenue immediately
17789900	17796460	quadrupled. In 2011 the game was updated to be completely free to play as revenue from
17796460	17801820	in-game transactions had come to far exceed those of people purchasing the game and after
17801820	17808220	Team Fortress 2 went free to play revenue went up again and the industry took notice.
17809660	17814220	At the same time as this new online games like League of Legends were also starting to draw
17814220	17819740	in lots of players while making a big profit. League of Legends was also free to play and
17819740	17825980	made money through cosmetic skins and purchasable champions. Players could acquire these champions
17825980	17830700	through slowly earning in-game currency as they played but many would choose to purchase them
17830700	17835180	for real money with more champions and skins being added over time to ensure there was always
17835180	17841340	something new to buy. At the time this business model was largely praised with the free to play
17841340	17846700	aspect helping the player base grow and the earnable in-game currency providing an alternative
17846700	17852780	to needing to spend real money. Of course players did still spend money and as the game's highly
17852780	17858300	competitive nature ensured strong replayability the player base grew and grew alongside the game's
17858300	17863740	revenue as League of Legends became one of the most played and most successful games of all time.
17865100	17869340	Still changing monetization wasn't exclusive to multiplayer games.
17870860	17876460	Once upon a time arcade games made big money by making gamers pay to play but some games went
17876460	17881820	even further like Double Dragon 3 which featured an in-game shop where players could purchase a
17881820	17888860	range of items including new characters weapons and power-ups. This was widely criticized and
17888860	17894860	arcades eventually lost popularity making the one-time purchase model of non-arcade games even more
17894860	17900860	standard. Older PC games did often sell physical expansion packs that added additional content
17900860	17906460	at less than full price and these were generally regarded quite positively as a fair way to expand
17906460	17912940	existing games. Things advanced with the arrival of Xbox Live where some games started to provide
17912940	17919100	bonus downloadable content usually for free. The Xbox Live marketplace been evolved with
17919100	17925180	launch of the 360 and soon featured small pieces of downloadable content at small costs with one
17925180	17930300	of the most infamous being the two and a half dollar cosmetic horse armor in the Elder Scrolls 4
17930300	17937020	Oblivion. A similar practice was later adopted by Sony and Nintendo at the same time but music
17937020	17942460	games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band were gaining popularity while making purchaseable downloadable
17942460	17950460	songs a core part of their business model and so smaller or micro transactions were introduced
17950460	17957420	to multi and single player games alike. Electronic Arts also introduced micro transactions via in-game
17957420	17964300	stores into several existing series like The Sims with its third entry. EA would then add a form
17964300	17970540	of luck based micro transaction in the 2009 edition of FIFA something that is now commonly referred
17970540	17977100	to as loot boxes. Loot boxes would go on to be added to many other popular online games including
17977100	17985900	Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, Battlefield, Call of Duty, League of Legends and more. In 2011
17985900	17991180	Rockstar pioneered a new approach by selling content that didn't exist yet in the form of a
17991180	17997980	Rockstar pass that could be purchased to unlock future content. Other games like Mortal Kombat and
17997980	18003980	Call of Duty soon adopted this season pass approach as well and in Call of Duty this would split the
18003980	18011900	player base between those with the season pass maps and those without. In 2012 Capcom's Street Fighter
18011900	18017180	tech and crossover drew criticism after including future DLC files on the game's physical disc.
18018060	18024060	While in 2013 Dead Space 3 again from EA became one of the first single player focused games to
18024060	18031180	offer a purchasable weapon and resource pack to assist players in its campaign. Later games like
18031180	18036460	Assassin's Creed Origins from Ubisoft and Middle Earth Shadow of War from Warner Bros would take
18036460	18043100	paid advantages in campaigns significantly further and in time microtransactions, in-game stores,
18043100	18049820	loot boxes and season passes would all become common practice in many big budget games. Although
18049820	18055900	often not without criticism from players, the media and even governmental regulators who have
18055900	18060540	likened loot boxes to gambling and raised concerns over their potential harmful impacts.
18062220	18065980	Meanwhile gaming companies have often sought to defend these additions by claiming that their
18065980	18070780	only providing players with more choice and that increases in video game budgets have occurred
18070780	18076220	over time while game prices have stayed relatively flat, meaning further monetization methods have
18076220	18083260	become necessary. Still regardless of whether any necessity does truly exist, more monetization
18083260	18090300	means more money and businesses don't usually turn down a chance for extra profit. As single
18090380	18096380	player focused games are less monetizable, a trend also began towards games as a service,
18096380	18102780	or live service games, where AAA games tried to expand into online areas or just placed increased
18102780	18109660	focus on future content updates to create continuous engagement from players. The king of live service
18109660	18115980	games is unquestionably Grand Theft Auto V, which continued Rockstar's tradition of high quality
18115980	18121980	and universally acclaimed open world titles in 2013, but then took things a step further with
18121980	18129500	Grand Theft Auto Online. GTA Online allows up to 30 players to freely roam GTA V's world
18129500	18135020	while completing lobby-based missions and earning experience points with a focus on general progression,
18135740	18140460	and while it did originally have a rocky launch, it soon went on to be hugely successful.
18140940	18145900	When Grand Theft Auto V released, it easily surpassed Call of Duty's sales records,
18145900	18153660	selling 11.2 million copies in its first 24 hours. Unlike so many of the best selling games before
18153660	18159980	it, however, Grand Theft Auto V continued to put out impressive sales figures year after year after
18159980	18167020	year. This was partly because of future releases on next-gen consoles and PC, but it was also because
18167020	18175180	of the impact and enduring popularity of Grand Theft Auto Online. And so, the gaming industry
18175180	18181020	saw how blockbuster single player games could be transformed into blockbuster live service games,
18181580	18186460	where they could not only continue to sell more copies due to staying relevant for longer,
18186460	18191500	but could also tap into the unbelievably lucrative territory of multiplayer-fuelled
18191820	18198620	microtransactions. One year after GTA V, Bungie released their new online-focused first-person
18198620	18203020	shooter Destiny, which combined elements of the MMO genre with FPS gameplay.
18204140	18209020	Destiny was also very profitable, with publisher Activision claiming it was the most successful
18209020	18215420	new gaming franchise launch in history, and between the success of GTA Online and Destiny,
18215420	18219180	the live service trend was established and proven beyond doubt.
18220300	18224460	Others would soon follow, including several developers that have previously built reputations
18224460	18231260	around creating single player games, such as Bioware with Anthem, Bethesda with Fallout 76,
18231260	18237900	and Crystal Dynamics with Marvel Avengers. Clearly, not every live service game was a success,
18237900	18242620	but for the biggest publishers in the industry, live service offered the biggest rewards,
18242620	18246860	and the trend towards live service games is still very much alive today.
18248300	18253420	Still, online gaming in the 2010s wasn't just defined by changes to monetization.
18254460	18258620	The decade would also see a number of new genres and new takes on existing genres,
18258620	18265420	as online gaming expanded upwards and outwards. In 2014, Blizzard's Half Stone achieved major
18265420	18269900	success for its accessible and polished take on the digital collectible card game genre.
18270540	18276380	In 2015, Rocket League from Xionics combined cars, rockets, and football to create one of
18276380	18282060	the decade's freshest sports games. And in 2016, Blizzard's Overwatch received great
18282060	18287260	critical acclaim for its team and hero-based FPS design that stood out from most other popular
18287260	18293100	shooters at the time. The decade's most popular new genre would come once more from a mod,
18293660	18298780	this time from Brendan Green, also known by his online alias, PlayerUnknown,
18298780	18304780	who created DayZ Battle Royale, which itself was an offshoot of the DayZ mod for Armor 2.
18306060	18311020	Taking inspiration from the Japanese film of the same name, the mod focused on player-vs-player
18311020	18316860	combat with a large number of combatants on a big open map. The scale of the map and the
18316860	18321500	random placement of weapons was intended to introduce an element of unpredictability,
18321500	18325180	and the battleground was designed to get progressively smaller as the games went on
18325180	18330860	to ensure regular action. The result turned out to be a hit and would eventually lead to the
18330860	18337260	creation of the standalone PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in March 2017 that soon turned Battle
18337260	18344220	Royale into a worldwide gaming phenomenon. Seeing the success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,
18344220	18349260	Epic Games decided to create a Battle Royale mod for their upcoming construction shooter hybrid
18349260	18355980	Fortnite to create Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017, and between the two games the
18355980	18362540	gaming industry was never quite the same again. Fortnite and PUBG offered different takes on
18362540	18368860	the same idea, with PUBG being more focused and prioritizing realism, and Fortnite standing out
18368860	18374460	thanks to its building mechanics and more cartoony aesthetic. The games would also fare differently
18374460	18380060	in different markets, with PUBG being a massive success in Asia and Fortnite finding dominance
18380060	18386300	over school yards across America and Europe. Still, one thing both games had in common was
18386300	18392460	being staggeringly successful. PUBG quickly broke the record for most concurrent players on Steam
18392460	18399260	with over 3.2 million, which was about 2 million more than the next highest game on record, and soon
18399260	18404460	Fortnite was able to boast even greater numbers. Many other Battle Royale games followed in their
18404460	18411740	wake, some successful, some not, some higher budget, some low, some shooters, some anything but, and
18411740	18416540	while most of these would not find long-term popularity, that didn't stop plenty of developers
18416540	18423100	from trying anyway. The 2010s were also the decade where online gaming spread beyond games.
18423340	18428220	Gaming tournaments had been around for a long time, and by the 90s some were even quite large,
18428220	18433900	like the Nintendo World Championships in 1990, or the Evolution Championship Series for fighting
18433900	18441580	games starting in 1996. In the 2000s, televised coverage started to be more popular, particularly
18441580	18446460	in South Korea, where StarCraft was well on its way to becoming the new national religion.
18446620	18453180	In the mid-2000s, esports history was made at EVO 2004, when Daigo Umehara, playing as Ken in
18453180	18456780	Street Fighter III, performed the Daigo Parry.
18476860	18488780	The 15-hit consecutive parry, with only one pixel of health remaining, into a comeback victory that
18488780	18494300	would see Umehara through to the finals, has since been described as the most iconic moment in
18494300	18500700	competitive gaming history. It was also a perfect showcase for the potential appeal of esports,
18500700	18507900	and by 2010 that potential was quickly becoming reality. New online streaming services opened
18507900	18513980	esports to a much wider audience, and with more popularity would come greater prize money and
18513980	18520540	bigger stages, as StarCraft, Counter-Strike, League of Legends and Dota all helped push esports into
18520540	18526780	the mainstream. With time, more and more games would follow as the numbers kept rising, and by
18526780	18533900	2019, Dota 2's The International tournament had a total prize pool of over 34 million dollars,
18533900	18540460	and League of Legends 2019 World Championships would see a peak of 44 million concurrent viewers.
18541820	18545580	Over the course of the decade, esports became big business,
18545580	18548540	but people weren't only watching competitive gaming.
18549980	18554220	Livestreaming and Let's Plays, made possible by platforms like Twitch and YouTube,
18554220	18558460	also rose to popularity in the first half of the decade, becoming a major new tool for
18558460	18562780	video game marketing and drawing great amounts of attention to certain titles.
18563980	18569260	Horror games like Amnesia the Dark Descent and Five Nights at Freddy's, or the social
18569260	18575500	deduction game Among Us, stand out as examples of how small games with little marketing can still
18575500	18583020	have massive impacts through this new online social media-fuelled ecosystem. Social media also
18583020	18589340	brought a greater focus to various controversies. Video games and controversy have long been
18589340	18595980	acquainted. For example, Mortal Kombat and Night Trap in 1993, Doom following the Columbine shooting
18595980	18601740	in 1999, Grand 5th Auto San Andreas following the discovery of the hot coffee mod in 2005,
18602460	18607420	Panic over the MMO genre following the success of World Warcraft, and Call of Duty Model
18607420	18613980	Morpher 2's Civilian Killing No Russian Mission in 2009 all provide examples of major gaming
18613980	18620220	controversies, but all of these past examples had one thing in common, which was that the
18620220	18627180	controversy was caused by people outside of the gaming industry looking in. In the 2010s however,
18627180	18632540	controversy started coming from within, while becoming more frequent and more intense.
18632540	18638700	One of the earliest examples of this was the ending for Mass Effect 3, which fans viewed as
18638700	18643420	disappointing for the similarity between different endings and for their failure to represent players'
18643420	18648940	choices over the trilogy. The negative response led to an open letter from Bioware's founder,
18649500	18654060	charity drives from fans, statements from the Federal Trade Commission and Better Business
18654060	18661580	Bureau, a revised extended cut DLC, a significant number of cupcakes, and a disparaging parody
18661580	18682380	from Weird Owl. For a disappointing game, this level of negative attention was unprecedented,
18682380	18685580	but it turned out this was just a taste of what was to come.
18685660	18693340	In 2014, gaming media and gaming communities embraced the political culture war with Gamergate,
18693340	18696620	and both have been vigorously arguing about politics ever since.
18697900	18704060	But there were also controversies over monetization, like with Middle Earth Shadow of War, Star Wars
18704060	18710220	Battlefront 2 and Genshin Impact, controversies over the disappointing state games released in,
18710220	18717900	like with No Man's Sky, Fallout 76 and Cyberpunk 2077, controversies over working conditions and
18717900	18725100	crunch periods at studios, like with Bioware, Rockstar and Naughty Dog, controversies over sexual
18725100	18732780	misconduct, like with Riot Games, Ubisoft and Blizzard, controversies over graphical downgrades,
18732780	18738540	controversies over DRM, controversies over lack of accreditation, controversies over lack of
18738540	18743340	difficulty options, controversies over games releasing too soon, controversies over games
18743340	18748380	releasing too late, controversies over story decisions, controversies over censorship,
18748380	18753820	controversies over translations, controversies over voice acting pay, controversies over cameos,
18753820	18757980	controversies over original authors, controversies over political representation,
18757980	18763580	gender representation, sexual representation, racial representation and religious representation,
18763580	18768220	and controversies over controversy and controversies over a lack of controversy,
18768860	18773420	and you could probably drag this section out even further if one were so inclined.
18774700	18779180	It's worth keeping in mind that for media outlets and online content creators,
18779180	18783260	controversy is one of the best ways to make money, and people are willing to do whatever
18783260	18788860	they can to encourage it. More surprising though is how much consumers seem to have embraced this
18788860	18793740	approach and how difficult it's become to avoid this constant focus on controversy
18793740	18800540	within gaming communities as a result. And so, the 2010s were a decade where the internet changed
18800540	18807740	many things, and video games were no exception. Still, while not all of these changes were positive,
18807740	18812700	the internet did allow for one part of the industry to flourish like never before.
18819820	18825820	After major breakthroughs in the 2000s, independent game development continued to thrive in the 2010s.
18826860	18831580	This period saw mainstream games growing cost and development time, which often led studios to
18831580	18836220	taking increasingly conservative approaches by sticking to proven genres and series.
18837340	18841180	Meanwhile, the smaller budgets of indie games meant they only needed a fraction of the sales
18841180	18845820	to be profitable, meaning developers could still succeed by appealing to niche audiences
18845820	18853420	or through taking greater risks. The result was a huge amount of diversity, from genre to art style,
18853420	18858940	to level of accessibility or more, as indie games brought variety at a time when the industry
18858940	18863980	needed it the most, which can be shown clearly by looking back through some of the decades most
18863980	18870780	critically and commercially successful titles. 2010 saw the release of Playdead's darkly atmospheric
18870780	18876940	experiential puzzle game Limbo, and Team Meat's fast-paced and fiendishly difficult 2D platformer
18876940	18883020	Super Meat Boy. 2011 would bring a new take on the rogue-like genre with the binding of Isaac,
18883020	18887980	which added action gameplay and Zelda-inspired procedurally-generated dungeons as players helped
18887980	18894380	Isaac escape his abusive mother. Relogix Terraria also released that year with the expansive 2D
18894380	18900220	sandbox game going on to sell 44 million copies, making it one of the best-selling games of all
18900220	18906540	time. In 2012, Journey from that game company impressed many with its striking use of visuals,
18906540	18910540	audio and non-verbal storytelling that would help it win several Game of the Year awards,
18911180	18916860	whereas Deniton Games' top-down shooter Hotline Miami came in hard with a mix of ultraviolence
18916860	18923900	and surrealism to provide a somewhat contrasting experience. 2013's Paper's Please from Lucas
18923900	18928860	Pope tested players' morality by putting them in the shoes of an immigration inspector at a border
18928860	18936700	checkpoint in the glorious dystopia of Aristosca. In 2014, Yacht Club Games 8-bit side-scrolling
18936700	18942060	platformer Shovel Knight paid homage to the gaming's past while impressing with cutting-edge controls
18942060	18949420	and level design. 2015's Undertale from Toby Fox provided a clever twist on RPG conventions
18949420	18956460	and created an enduring fandom alongside one of gaming's greatest soundtracks. In 2016,
18956460	18960860	video game players that wanted to avoid going outside were positively spoilt for choice.
18961500	18966540	Concerned Ape's Stardew Valley became a sensation for its open-ended and relaxing take on the farming
18966540	18972380	sim genre. Plactorio from Woop Software gave players an endlessly deep factory and automation
18972380	18978220	simulator while establishing its own genre in the process, and Rimworld from Ludeon Studios
18978220	18983420	combined base-building and emergent storytelling in its addictive and relatively accessible take
18983420	18989740	on the colony's sim genre. Meanwhile, 2017 seemed determined to test players' skills
18989740	18996220	with the demanding and impeccably presented Cuphead from Studio MDHR that had players running,
18996220	19001980	gunning and repeatedly dying to its many creative boss fights, and Hollow Knight from Team Cherry,
19001980	19007020	an expansive and surprisingly epic Metroidvania that had players take on the role of a nameless
19007020	19013980	knight as you explore the Fallen Kingdom of Hallownest. In 2018, Subset Games Into the Breach
19013980	19019020	offered strategy fans something new by stripping away much of a genre to place all the focus on
19019020	19025980	its rich, tactically engaging turn-based gameplay. 2019 would see the release of Megacrit's much
19025980	19031340	copied yet never bested road-like deckbuilder Slay the Spire, as well as Mobius Digital's
19031340	19036380	time-loop adventure game Outer Wilds that gave players complete freedom to explore its miniature
19036380	19043180	solar system as they unraveled the mysteries of its unforgettable universe. Finally, in 2020,
19043180	19048700	Supergiant Games wowed the world with the action-roke like Hades, a game with so much content
19048700	19053340	and such high-quality presentation that it almost seems to have left the indie label behind.
19054780	19059020	Indie games have come a long way, to the point where the term indie
19059020	19065580	increasingly tells you very little. Once upon a time, the word seemed to imply certain characteristics,
19065580	19071900	like games that are short, cheap, retro or artsy. Yet, by the end of the decade,
19071900	19078300	indie could imply almost anything, with massive companies like Ubisoft, EA and Tencent all creating
19078300	19083980	games in traditionally indie styles, all while independent developers increasingly create games
19083980	19090700	with a level of ambition, size or presentation comparable to many big-name studios. It's also
19090700	19094780	worth noting that there are many other games that could have been mentioned in this section as well,
19094780	19097740	and it is a testament to the strength of the indie market,
19097740	19101900	just how spoiled the choice you are when looking for high-quality games to highlight.
19103180	19106700	Still, the vast number of indie games being developed over the past decade
19106700	19111740	became a talking point in itself, with many raising concerns that so many indie games
19111740	19115580	makes it harder and harder for indie developers to get noticed and find success.
19116940	19121340	As the indie market seemed to be reaching a point of saturation in the later half of the decade,
19121340	19126940	the term indie-pocalypse started to be used to refer to this situation, and yet while increased
19126940	19132220	competition may have made success harder, there has been no sign of an indie market collapse,
19132220	19138780	and good games continue to be released. This continued rise of indie gaming also brought
19138780	19144620	a number of related trends. Minecraft paved the way for the concept of early access,
19144620	19149100	where many indie games would release unfinished and receive continuous updates over time.
19149100	19155260	This helped establish new genres, like survival games, while also aiding developers by assisting
19155260	19159500	with funding during development and making it easier to incorporate player feedback.
19160540	19164460	The downside of this system was that it could also lead to anti-consumer practices
19164460	19169580	of misleading advertising, over-promising, or just abandoning games unfinished after
19169580	19175740	receiving players' money. Still, for every standout early access disaster, it's easy to find
19175740	19182700	other standout successes. Alongside early access, the 2010s also saw the rise of crowdfunding in
19182700	19188540	game development, usually through the platform Kickstarter. This often involved respected
19188540	19193500	figures within the industry wanting to bring back classic series or genres that publishers deemed
19193500	19199420	too risky to fund, and crowdfunding games could vary between relatively big games from already
19199500	19203820	well-established studios to much smaller projects from individual developers.
19205100	19209980	With time, many crowdfunded games were released, and amongst them were many of the decades most
19209980	19215900	acclaimed indie games, but there were also plenty of notable failures, from MMOs accused of being
19215900	19221980	scams to games that critically bombed or just games that never released at all. Through the
19221980	19227100	combination of crowdfunding and indie growth, the 2010s would see a lot of genre revivals,
19227100	19231660	particularly from those once popular in the past that don't fit well with modern AAA game design.
19232780	19239660	These included RTS games, point-and-click adventures, CRPGs, shoot-'em-ups, boomer-shooters,
19239660	19244780	space sims, classic survival horror, beat-'em-ups, FMV games, and many more.
19245900	19251180	Retro-inspired games in particular saw a resurgence in the 2010s, possibly because people who once
19251180	19255900	grew up with older games were now old enough to create games themselves and took inspiration from
19255900	19261420	their favourite games of the past, but also because the smaller budgets of indie games fit well
19261420	19267420	with retro-inspired design. And developers weren't the only ones making games this decade.
19268300	19272620	One of the most played games at the end of the decade, and one of the most confusing for older
19272620	19278620	generations, was Roblox, a game creation platform that allows users to share their own games inside
19278620	19284540	its engine. Roblox attained great popularity with younger generations, probably as much
19284540	19291260	like Minecraft before it, it tapped into players' natural creativity. Finally, the 2010s would also
19291260	19296700	see game development go global as indie development and digital distribution opened the industry up
19296700	19302140	to more regions around the world. Still, as the ninth generation of consoles finally approached
19302140	19306860	in the latter half of the decade, the attention would once more return to Japan.
19315100	19321180	No company has more experience in the gaming industry than Nintendo. But in 2012,
19321180	19326860	the gaming veteran experienced something new. As for the first time since entering the industry,
19326940	19334700	Nintendo would see a financial loss for the year, of $366 million. In 2013,
19334700	19340540	they would report similar losses, and in 2014, those losses would grow even greater.
19341580	19347020	The Wii U was a failure, but for the first time, Nintendo was starting to fail as well.
19348460	19353820	They had never been further behind in the console race. The once reliable handheld market was rapidly
19353820	19358860	shrinking, and unlike certain other big names, they didn't have additional areas of business
19358860	19365980	outside of gaming. Video games were basically everything to them. And this is the climate in
19365980	19372940	which they would create their next and possibly last console. Nintendo's growing desperation
19372940	19378700	was visible long before their next console would be ready. In 2014, the company headscrafted a new
19378700	19384780	strategy to turn their finances around. A key part of this was to reverse their earliest stance
19384780	19390060	on mobile gaming. Originally, Nintendo wanted to preserve the quality of their franchises,
19390060	19395340	and continue their practice of only allowing Nintendo games on Nintendo hardware. But now,
19395340	19400220	they were looking to enter the mobile market in an attempt to maximize their intellectual property,
19400860	19406060	leading to core Nintendo series like Super Mario, Animal Crossing, and Mario Kart,
19406060	19411580	making their mobile debuts. This was also the time that Nintendo launched Amiibo,
19411580	19415820	a toys to life figure series that had built-in functionality with certain Nintendo games.
19417020	19422700	Still, as useful as additional monetization might be, Nintendo still knew the deciding factor would
19422700	19431500	always be their next console. So, how do you respond to record losses and your greatest ever failure?
19431500	19437580	Well, Nintendo's answer was to double down and try the same thing again.
19438780	19444700	And so, once more, Nintendo would avoid competing with their rivals in terms of power. Once more,
19444700	19449420	they would focus the console around a portable screen, and once more, they would target the same
19449420	19454380	audience with the same intent to bridge the gap between serious and more casual gamers.
19455740	19460940	Still, far from creating a Wii U 2, this console would instead learn from the Wii U's mistakes
19460940	19465740	and address its greatest shortcomings, providing true portability without needing to stay close
19465740	19471180	to a console, as well as better battery life, a more comfortable and versatile design, and of
19471180	19479020	course, less confusing marketing. Officially announced in October 2016 after years of fan rumors
19479020	19484860	and released in March the following year, the Nintendo Switch was a gamble. By this point,
19484860	19488700	many Nintendo fans were sick of being behind the competition in terms of power,
19488700	19494620	and were frustrated by Nintendo's continued focus on gimmicks. The Nintendo Switch ignored this.
19495580	19499420	Similarly, the Nintendo 3DS, while less successful than its predecessor,
19499420	19504300	was still Nintendo's best-selling system at the time, and by creating a new portable device,
19504300	19509180	Nintendo were risking competition with their own system, while also combining their two
19509180	19514140	main existing revenue streams. What's more, after several disappointing years,
19514140	19518140	Nintendo were fast approaching the point where they simply couldn't afford another
19518140	19523260	lackluster launch, and following the reveal, plenty of onlookers were expressing doubts.
19524620	19530060	But in the end, those doubts would not be founded. The Switch launched strong.
19530860	19536620	By the end of March, it had sold 2.74 million units, exceeding Nintendo's expectations.
19537820	19543580	Nintendo responded by increasing production capacity. The Switch responded by continuing to sell.
19544460	19548700	Nintendo upped their forecast for the financial year, aiming for 10 million units sold,
19548700	19552540	and the Switch then upped its sales again, meeting this target with months to spare.
19553500	19557500	By the end of its first year, the scale of Nintendo's success was starting to be revealed.
19558220	19563580	It would take the Switch less than 12 months to overtake for lifetime sales of the Wii U,
19563580	19568300	and in the process, it became the fastest-selling games console in history.
19568380	19575020	Things change quickly in the gaming industry, but sometimes they change in your favor.
19576220	19579980	There is no single reason for the Switch's record-breaking success,
19579980	19584060	and its reception from reviewers was no more positive than the Wii U before it.
19585100	19589420	The portability of the system is a clear upgrade from its predecessor, and the Switch may have
19589420	19594460	benefited more from a lack of handheld competition, as while smartphones were more common than ever,
19594540	19598780	the Switch offered something much more traditional and substantial than mobile gaming did,
19598780	19600700	which might have appealed to a different audience.
19601980	19604780	It may also have benefited from the failure of the Wii U.
19605980	19610540	Nintendo learned from the earlier system's hardware and marketing to make needed improvements
19610540	19615420	on their second attempt, and the Wii U's underplayed library also gave Nintendo the
19615420	19620220	perfect opportunity to port many of its best games over to their newer system to quickly
19620220	19623740	expand the Switch's lineup and ensure the system got off to a strong start.
19624940	19630940	And speaking of games, the Switch certainly had its share, including a launch title that
19630940	19634620	may have been the first true killer app seen in more than a decade.
19635660	19640700	The legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild, is one of the most highly acclaimed games in history.
19641740	19647100	By taking Zelda Open World, it gave new life to the Zelda series and the Open World genre,
19647180	19652060	with a more hands-off and exploration-driven approach to game design that many felt represented
19652060	19657100	what had been lacking from many other games of the modern era. Breath of the Wild was a
19657100	19662940	true system seller, and its sales clearly show this, as it accounted for almost 50% of the
19662940	19667500	Switch's early software sales, with the game selling nearly one-to-one with the console.
19668940	19674060	Launching with a mainline Zelda title, let alone one of the best-received Zelda titles in history,
19674060	19679500	is always a significant advantage for a console, but the Switch's first year included more hits
19679500	19685100	than just Breath of the Wild. Soon after its release, it would receive its all-time best-selling
19685100	19691260	game by way of the ever-popular Mario Kart 8, which was an expanded version of the Wii U title,
19691260	19695980	as well as a well-received sequel to third-person territory control game Splatoon,
19695980	19701340	and even a new 3D Mario game in Super Mario Odyssey, which gave the Switch
19701340	19707420	its second critically adored, must-own title. In a time when consoles were increasingly launching
19707420	19712700	with weaker and weaker line-ups, and had less and less exclusive games, the Switch finished its
19712700	19719180	first year looking like a true heavyweight, with plenty more still to come. And as the Nintendo
19719180	19723500	Switch got off to a great start, it pretty much solved Nintendo's long-running third-party
19723500	19728620	support problem, as many developers no longer wanted to miss out on the Switch's larger user base.
19728860	19735100	But it wasn't just Nintendo who would have a good year in 2017, and it wasn't just Nintendo
19735100	19741420	who needed such a year. After the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in 1985, Japan
19741420	19747340	dominated the gaming industry for over 30 years, but as gaming moved to high definition,
19747340	19753820	this quickly started to change. More and more of the best-selling and highest-reviewed games
19754780	19761020	were coming to be from outside Japan, with major Japanese series like Final Fantasy and Gran Turismo
19761020	19766060	seeming to experience longer, more drawn-out development periods and a decline in critical
19766060	19772380	and fan reception. In this period, a new trend began of Japanese studios outsourcing established
19772380	19779660	franchises to Western developers, something that was once almost unheard of. And this wasn't just
19779740	19787020	small unknown series either, it included some big and beloved names like Resident Evil, Silent Hill,
19787020	19794780	Devil May Cry, Dead Rising, Castlevania, Contra, and more. The worst part of his trend was that
19794780	19799260	almost every one of these games was received far more poorly than the older Japanese-developed
19799260	19805100	games of the same series. Meanwhile, other major Japanese publishers like Square Enix would make
19805180	19810060	moves to acquire Western-based developers in order to adapt to the changing market demands.
19811100	19816220	Konami went even further by going on to abandon games altogether in favour of focusing on
19816220	19821980	gambling and the pachinko market, while industry giant Sony shifted their focus far more heavily
19821980	19828700	towards Western developers and Western audiences. And this was more than just a change in where
19828700	19835820	development was taking place. From 2007 to 2012, the Japanese gaming industry shrank for
19835820	19842140	five years in a row, and the only major Japanese developer doing well in this period was Nintendo,
19842140	19849260	who were about to release the Wii U. And so, as the Japanese gaming industry stumbled and fell,
19849260	19854940	a lot of people started to take notice. The views of the general gaming populace were perhaps best
19854940	19861340	summarised by once-popular indie developer Phil Fish when asked what he thought of recent Japanese games.
19884940	19900860	As tone-deaf as this might now seem, at the time, Fish really was just saying something many people
19900860	19906140	were thinking, and it wasn't just Western developers and journalists. Japanese developers
19906140	19910940	were also highly critical, and it's not an exaggeration to say that the Japanese industry
19910940	19916060	was experiencing a genuine crisis that was made even more dramatic by how much of a fool from
19916060	19924780	grace it seemed to represent. But in 2017, this would finally change, as Japan took back its crown.
19926300	19932620	It began before the year even started. At the very end of 2016, two games famous for being stuck in
19932620	19940460	development hell finally released. Final Fantasy XV was first shown in 2006. The Last Guardian,
19940460	19946380	the next game from the team behind Ico and Shadow of Colossus, was first announced in early 2007.
19947260	19953020	Ten years later, after much anticipation, derision and desperation, these games finally made it to
19953020	19959260	the public, and both were received positively. But this was only a taste of what was to come.
19959660	19965660	January 2017, Resident Evil 7 released two critical acclaim after the previous mainline entry was
19965660	19971740	widely panned, and achieved success by returning the series to its survival horror roots. The very
19971740	19977180	same day, Yakuza Zero released in the West, becoming the most successful Yakuza game of all time,
19977180	19983580	and popularizing the series outside Japan. In February, Neo released ending developer Ninja
19984540	19988940	Theory's long run of poorly received titles, and becoming their most highly acclaimed game
19988940	19995660	since Ninja Gaiden in 2004. March brought Neo Automata, which released a critical acclaim,
19995660	20000700	becoming the first game from beloved oddball game director Yoko Taro to reach mainstream audiences.
20001500	20006460	This was the same month that the Nintendo Switch and Breath of the Wild also made their debut.
20007740	20013180	April continued with Persona 5, which became the most highly reviewed JRPG since Final Fantasy 9
20013260	20017820	in 2000, while also making thousands of people online say the words,
20017820	20024060	I don't usually like JRPGs, but... Something worth keeping in mind here is that
20024060	20030700	Yakuza Zero, Neo, Neo Automata, and Persona 5 all released as PlayStation exclusives in the first
20030700	20040140	half of 2017, all received great reviews, and all sold millions of copies. And yet, at E3 2016,
20040140	20045500	Sony wouldn't promote any of these four games. They ended up as some of the best
20045500	20051100	PlayStation exclusives in years on a console that was, at the time, light on exclusives,
20051100	20057260	and yet Sony had refused to show any of them in favor of focusing on multi-platform games like
20057260	20064860	Call of Duty, Modern Warfare Remastered, and LEGO Star Wars, The Force Awakens. This was probably
20064860	20070700	because these games simply looked to Japanese, and despite being a Japanese company, Sony seemed
20070700	20076460	to decide that showing such Japanese looking games could be bad for their brand. This was the
20076460	20081820	situation Japanese games were in, at least this was the situation in the eyes of the biggest
20081820	20088940	Japanese games company in the world, until 2017 happened. June brought the triumph in return of
20088940	20094300	one of gaming's most iconic fighting series, Tekken, after an 8 year absence. July brought
20094300	20099740	the release of Dragon Quest XI, only in Japan and yet Japan alone was enough to reach 5 million copies
20099740	20105980	sold. August brought the return of 2D Sonic in Sonic Mania, a game not made by Japanese developers,
20105980	20110620	but instead by several Sonic fans, and yet it went on to give the iconic Japanese series its best
20110620	20115900	reviewed game since the Dreamcast. September brought the return of Metroid in Samus Returns,
20115900	20121660	seven years after the last Metroid game, and 13 years since the last 2D Metroid. October brought
20121660	20126220	Super Mario Odyssey, and December rounded the year off with Xenoblade Chronicles 2,
20126220	20130300	the best selling game in the long running Xeno series, and another reason for Switch and
20130300	20136620	JRPG fans to be happy that year. For video games, some years are better than others,
20136620	20142780	and 2017 was without doubt one of the best of the modern era. There were good western and indie
20142780	20148220	games released that year as well, but it was Japanese developers who stole the show, and the idea that
20148220	20154620	the Japanese games industry was falling behind, or dying, would be permanently dispelled ever since.
20155820	20160540	Nintendo and the Switch would find further success in the following years, with major titles like
20160540	20166220	Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizon, and many many Pokemon games.
20167420	20172620	Still, as the decade reached its end, attention would return once more to the other two major
20172620	20177660	giants of gaming as their next generation of consoles were getting ready to finally release.
20178700	20193100	The most interesting thing about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X is how uninteresting they are.
20194140	20198300	Once upon a time, different gaming consoles were entirely distinct species,
20198300	20203340	but look past for deceptively varied exteriors of Sony's and Microsoft's latest efforts,
20203340	20211180	and you'll find near identical pieces of hardware. AMD 8 core Zen 2 CPUs, AMD Radeon
20211180	20217180	R DNA GPUs, similar SSD drives, similar promises in resolution and frame rate,
20217180	20221980	similar backwards compatibility, similar disc and digital only variants,
20221980	20226700	similar prices, although the digital only Xbox is cheaper and less powerful,
20226700	20231820	and a similar release date, which basically means, unless you're a tech enthusiast,
20231820	20238060	a dedicated fanboy or girl, or a paid marketer, there isn't anything important separating the
20238060	20244220	two machines at a technical level. The real proof of this is in multi-platform performance,
20245020	20251740	where once the 360 beat the PS3, and then the PS4 beat the Xbox One, now there's no clear difference.
20252700	20256940	Some games might perform better on one system over the other, but even then the differences
20256940	20262700	tend to be small and don't always follow any general rule. This doesn't mean the launch of
20262700	20267900	the two systems was uneventful, but even here, events of note had nothing to do with the systems.
20268940	20274300	A global pandemic, combined with a global microchip shortage, led to supply issues and stock
20274300	20280300	shortages for both companies, which then led to heavy scalping. For what it's worth,
20280300	20285260	the PlayStation 5 got scalped harder and would eventually sell more, with recent
20285260	20293500	figures putting the PS5 at 30 million units sold to the Xbox's 18.5 million, although even in 2022,
20293500	20300060	hardware availability was still a limiting factor. Regardless, even if the console war has turned
20300060	20304540	cold, there have still been major developments that will likely shape the future of gaming in
20304540	20310700	the years to follow. The first is the emergence of virtual reality headsets, which would see a
20310700	20316780	major breakthrough when 18 year old Palmer Lucky had the idea to use cheap lenses in place of older
20316780	20321580	expensive lenses and instead tackle the problem of lens distortion through software,
20322220	20329020	creating the potential for much lower cost systems. Lucky was joined by John Carmack of Doomfame,
20329020	20334860	and together they created the company Oculus VR in 2012, which was then purchased by Facebook
20334940	20340060	two years later. Sony and Valve would also start development of their own headsets,
20340060	20348220	and in 2016 the Oculus Rift, the Vive from Valve and HTC, and PlayStation VR all launched to the
20348220	20355420	public and received a mixed reception. Praise was given to the immersiveness and uniqueness of the
20355420	20361580	experience, while criticism focused on the high prices, high latency, the practicality of space
20361660	20368060	required, long-term comfort, and the possibility of motion sickness. In time, second generation
20368060	20373740	headsets arrived that made significant improvements over their predecessors. The Oculus Quest 1 and 2
20373740	20379020	provided standalone headsets that removed the problem of wires. The Valve Index provided
20379020	20384140	impressive field of view and resolution while making improvements to comfort, albeit at an
20384140	20390140	impressively high price, and recently the PlayStation VR 2 provided a high-end headset
20390140	20397020	with an OLED screen and a strong price-to-performance ratio. Seven years after VR headsets first
20397020	20402460	arrived, it's become clear that despite their rather lackluster start, VR technology is making
20402460	20409340	impressive strides and still getting better every year. That said, truly widespread adoption still
20409340	20414620	hasn't happened yet, and the experience provided by VR headsets has so far seemed to be more of an
20414700	20420940	adjacent experience to traditional gaming than a replacement. As while VR does allow for completely
20420940	20426780	new types of experiences, it also has significant disadvantages, like the limitations of controls
20426780	20432860	or long-term comfort that make it a bad fit for some areas of gaming. Still, when it comes to the
20432860	20438540	console war, Sony has established themselves as one of the best manufacturers in the VR industry
20438540	20444380	and are placing more and more focus on VR games, while Nintendo have mostly stayed away
20444380	20449900	and Microsoft has made some big moves in the past but have distanced themselves more recently,
20449900	20454700	meaning if VR does become a larger part of the industry, it's Sony who looks like the one who
20454700	20460140	benefit the most. And if the rate at which VR technology is improving remains steady,
20460140	20466540	it's easy to imagine the VR industry seeing significant growth over the 2020s, as better tech
20466540	20472700	leads to more users, which leads to more games, which leads to more users, as the positive feedback
20472700	20479420	loop kicks in and VR finally becomes a core part of the industry alongside consoles, PC and mobiles.
20480940	20486060	But while Sony might be winning at VR, Microsoft has seen growth in a different area.
20487420	20492140	Game streaming has been around since the start of the decade, with companies like OnLive and
20492140	20497340	Gaikai offering forms of cloud gaming, a service where you play games on a remote server,
20497340	20503500	which is then streamed directly to a user's device. This removes costly hardware requirements,
20503500	20508860	but also requires high-speed, low-latency internet connections and substantial data usage.
20510060	20515980	Neither OnLive nor Gaikai would turn a profit and both would eventually be acquired by Sony,
20515980	20519740	but in time other cloud-based streaming services would appear to take their place.
20520700	20525980	Meanwhile, both Sony and Microsoft launched their own game subscription services, PlayStation Now
20525980	20531180	and Xbox Game Pass, which would incorporate cloud gaming as well as provide access to a range of
20531180	20537580	games that can be played for no additional cost. Of all subscription and streaming-based services,
20537580	20542620	Xbox Game Pass has reached the most users, while seeing substantial uptake amongst PC players.
20543580	20548140	It seems clear that the plan is to create something like a Netflix for video games,
20548140	20551820	however despite heavy investment from Microsoft, they still haven't been able to reach their
20551820	20557740	target numbers and are facing a lot of competition from other companies like Amazon and Nvidia.
20559100	20562380	The full impact of game subscriptions and streaming remains to be seen.
20563180	20567020	Some worry that widespread use of game subscriptions will move games further towards
20567020	20572060	additional monetization methods like microtransactions, while widespread use of streaming
20572060	20577100	could have an even more substantial impact as it threatens the existence of traditional console
20577100	20583100	and PC gaming entirely, particularly in regions where people may already have less disposable income.
20584380	20588780	Rumors also currently exist about a cloud gaming handheld device from Sony,
20588780	20593340	and it seems possible that cloud gaming will come to play a much greater role in the industry
20593340	20599020	in years to come. Game Pass hasn't been Microsoft's only recent investment, however.
20599740	20603980	The final trend that seems to be defining the current generation is consolidation.
20603980	20609740	When Microsoft announced its acquisition of five smaller studios at E3 2018,
20609740	20614940	few questioned the move. Sony had been winning the exclusive war for years and showed no signs
20614940	20619740	of stopping, so it made sense that Microsoft would look to acquire talented studios of their own
20619740	20624060	to create dedicated first-party titles to help them keep up with the competition.
20625260	20631420	Microsoft's acquisitions didn't end at E3 2018, however. First, there were more smaller
20631420	20635980	studios announced. Then, there was the more surprising news of a deal to acquire Zenimax in
20635980	20643020	2020 for $8.1 billion, which included Bethesda and big-name franchises like The Elder Scrolls and
20643020	20649020	Fallout. Then, other large companies seemed to join in with major purchases, like EA acquiring
20649020	20656460	Gloomobile for $2.4 billion, Take-Two acquiring Zynga for $12.7 billion, and Sony acquiring Bungie
20656460	20662700	for $3.7 billion. Still, the biggest buyer would once again be Microsoft, who announced the deal
20662700	20670940	to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2022. Activision Blizzard are the largest
20670940	20678700	third-party publisher in gaming, and an acquisition of this size is unprecedented. This is different
20678700	20683180	to buying talented studios, which is something large gaming companies have been doing for years.
20683980	20687660	Instead, this is basically buying a significant chunk of the industry,
20687660	20693020	and many, including regulatory bodies and antitrust agencies, have expressed concern
20693020	20697340	about the potential negative impacts this may have, with the deal still currently facing
20697340	20702300	significant challenge, particularly from the competition and markets authority in the United
20702300	20706940	Kingdom. Whether this deal will ultimately go through, though, remains to be seen.
20708220	20712620	Microsoft has been quietly losing the console war for years, and most believe
20712620	20718060	competition between major gaming companies can only benefit consumers. Yet, whether these moves
20718060	20723900	will make the console market more or less competitive is unclear, and this general trend
20723900	20730860	towards consolidation certainly raises concerns. Still, this is hardly the only thing people have
20730860	20746380	been critical of in recent years. The Romans had a saying that translates to,
20746380	20751580	the past is always well remembered, and the Romans weren't alone in this belief.
20752940	20758620	Sometimes, however, things really do get worse. So, what about video games?
20759580	20764220	Everywhere you look online, you'll find people telling you about how bad games are now,
20764220	20770140	and how much better they were in the past, but the internet is also addicted to negativity,
20770140	20777660	and people are biased. So, what evidence is there for this belief, and what does gaming's 50 year
20777660	20785820	history actually tell us? Well, for one thing, the future does raise concerns, but a worrying
20785900	20792940	future isn't anything new. This is an industry of change, and change brings uncertainty.
20793740	20799740	The gaming industry has crashed more than once. The console market almost died completely. The
20799740	20804780	biggest gaming company in the world went bankrupt. Many other console manufacturers also exited the
20804780	20810460	scene. Reliable companies have produced spectacular failures. Established companies have experienced
20810540	20816140	tragic deaths. Y2K didn't happen, but multiple stock market crashes did. The most successful
20816140	20820540	console of all time was followed by the company's greatest failure, and soon after this, every other
20820540	20826060	major player also suffered their greatest failures. Motion controls threatened to take over, PC gaming
20826060	20830780	threatened to become irrelevant, mobile gaming threatened to take over, indie gaming threatened
20830780	20837180	to become apocalyptic, online gaming threatened to take over, and now, consolidation, monetization,
20837260	20843820	and subscription services threaten gaming as we know it. And time will tell how things play out,
20843820	20849260	but really, future concerns are a part of the gaming industry, and they always have been.
20850620	20856860	So, what about the present? Well, one of the biggest trends in the last 10 years has been a
20856860	20864380	growing abundance of remakes, remasters, reboots, and re-releases. On the one hand,
20864380	20868940	old games don't always remain accessible, and so attempts to bring them to modern audiences
20868940	20874940	makes sense. And as the passage of time creates more old games, it also makes sense that there
20874940	20880460	might be more attempts to bring back older classics. This might also be representative
20880460	20884780	of the changing demographics of gamers, where there's now a large portion of older people
20884780	20890780	nostalgic for the games from their childhood, or younger gamers unwilling or unable to play older
20890780	20896620	games who still want a way to feel included. Still, one thing that is hard to justify is the
20896620	20902540	low quality of some of these newer additions. There are many remasters and remakes that could
20902540	20908700	be criticized, but perhaps the single one most endemic of a bigger problem is Grand Theft Auto,
20908700	20914300	The Trilogy, The Definitive Edition, a compilation of three of the best-selling games of the 2000s
20914300	20919820	that was published by one of the most respected developers in gaming, and yet, the end result
20919900	20926060	was appalling, being buggy, inauthentic, and an all-round visual downgrade, with missing
20926060	20932220	animations, sound effects, and textures. The Definitive Edition received one of the lowest
20932220	20938540	user scores of all time, and stands as a testament to just how bad an improved addition can be,
20938540	20943900	with Rockstar making matters even worse by also removing the original games from stores at the
20943900	20951340	same time. So, various re-releases have given companies a lazy and low-cost way to cash in on
20951340	20957980	past games. Some remakes do receive considerably more effort, but even these display a deep lack
20957980	20963260	of originality as companies are choosing to finance remakes of still readily accessible
20963260	20969260	and enjoyable games in place of creating something new, and this practice seems to be becoming more
20969260	20978540	common. So far in 2023, 90% of the highest-rated games are remasters and remakes. This is rather
20978540	20984300	pathetic, but the high critical ratings and the fact these games continue to sell is proof that
20984300	20991420	this is what many people want. One day, attitudes might change, but for now gaming companies just
20991420	20996460	seem to be giving the people what they ask for, with the quality varying between attempts.
20997180	21003100	Another trend of modern gaming has been additional monetization methods, such as loot boxes and in-game
21003100	21009580	cash stores. For the mobile industry and many online games, these have been incredibly effective at
21009580	21015420	increasing revenue, and this has come to extend to even some more traditional games, although some
21015420	21021340	attempts have been met with considerable backlash. Still, much like with remasters and remakes,
21021420	21026140	consumers again have a choice here, both in whether to play these games and whether to spend
21026140	21031100	money on these services, and again, many people are making the choices that make additional
21031100	21037820	monetization methods profitable. The gaming industry is a business, and if consumers allow it,
21037820	21045180	companies will do what makes them the most money. Finally, another obvious trend has been a decline
21045180	21050300	in the quality of AAA, with games seeming to take longer to release while taking less
21051260	21055660	risks in their design and being more likely to launch unfinished and buggy.
21056860	21061180	This is partly because advancements in game technology have slowed over time,
21061180	21065660	alongside ever rising game development costs, which has meant graphical upgrades have become
21065660	21070780	less noticeable, and impressing gamers through continually creating more spectacular games
21070780	21077820	has become harder. As a result, games might be overambitious, or make sacrifices to gameplay
21077820	21084060	or design, or take longer to release, or make sacrifices to quality in order to meet deadlines.
21085180	21089820	Claiming that AAA games have got worse in recent years seems pretty reasonable though.
21090700	21094700	The thing is, many of the highest-rated and best-selling games from recent years
21094700	21100700	have still been the biggest budget and most visually impressive titles. Critics and consumers
21100700	21106460	are like, want and reward AAA game design, and amongst these games there will be some that
21106460	21113100	succeed, and some that fall short. It seems unrealistic to expect every game to meet the
21113100	21118620	highest standards, or to criticise the industry for caring too much about budgets and presentation,
21118620	21121980	while people continue to praise those same qualities in other games.
21123740	21129100	A lot of the problems mentioned here do have some relation to greed, and the gaming industry,
21129100	21135740	like other industries, can certainly be greedy. This also isn't anything new however.
21136540	21141180	After the success of Pong, gaming companies made so many Pong clones, the industry collapsed.
21141900	21146620	After the success of Atari, game developers made so many low-quality third-party games
21146620	21152140	that the industry collapsed again. Space Invaders led to too many arcade space games,
21152140	21157020	NES developers made too many action platformers, Doom led to too many Doom clones,
21157020	21162380	Grand Theft Auto led to too many GTA clones, Guitar Hero led to too many plastic peripherals,
21162460	21167660	The Wii led to too many motion control devices, and too many low-effort motion control games.
21167660	21172620	Call of Duty led to too many Call of Duties, Minecraft led to too many Minecraft clones,
21172620	21177980	Dark Souls led to too many Souls Likes, Skyrim and Far Cry 3 led to too many Open World games,
21177980	21182540	Daisy led to too many Early Access Survival games, PUBG and Fortnite led to too many Battle
21182540	21187500	Real games, Indie games led to too many Indie games, Slay the Spire led to too many Rogue-like
21187500	21193180	deckbuilders and most recently, Vampire Survivors led to too many whatever the hell genre this is.
21194300	21200540	The point is, success often leads to saturation, and it's been that way since the very start.
21201500	21206860	And yet, at the same time, the industry has often rewarded those who go against the grain.
21207660	21214380	Pac-Man, Tetris, Pokemon Red and Blue, Half-Life, The Sims, The DS, The Wii, Minecraft,
21214460	21221100	Dark Souls, Daisy, Battle Real, Gaming History is littered with games that did something different
21221100	21226940	and were rewarded for doing so. The point that I think everything comes down to in the end
21227740	21233500	is choice. People do have a choice in who they support and how they spend their time,
21234140	21239740	and sometimes the choices of gaming companies or the general public can be frustrating,
21240540	21244140	but it is their choice to make and they do have their reasons.
21245500	21251820	And after months of researching, thinking and writing about gaming history, I have come to the
21251820	21260700	conclusion that nothing defines this present moment in time as much as choice does. It is a
21260700	21265740	strange thing to try to write the history of the present, because so much of how we understand
21265740	21271900	the period is shaped by how it looks from the future. That said, I don't think there is a crisis
21271900	21277900	of modern gaming. I don't think the industry is in decline, and I don't think games are getting
21277900	21284780	worse. And the reason is because currently, right now, we all have an abundance of choice.
21285980	21291820	The industry has grown wider and become more accessible, but this is the result of growth,
21292540	21295900	and traditional gaming hasn't been sacrificed to achieve this.
21297340	21300940	Instead, within traditional gaming, we've seen a tremendous increase
21300940	21305980	in the number and types of indie games being made, while through emulation,
21305980	21311980	re-releases, community efforts, second-hand purchases, and official subscription services,
21311980	21317660	older games have never been more available, and with the likes of cloud gaming and indie games,
21317660	21323820	the barrier of entry into gaming has never been so low. The number of games being made
21323820	21331500	has also increased, and for most people, older games are still out there. Everyone today has
21331500	21338540	a great amount of choice, and that makes us rather lucky. I hope this abundance of choice
21338540	21345660	remains in the future. In fact, I hope we get even more choice in the years to come, but this isn't
21345660	21353900	guaranteed. One day, all old cartridges will stop working, CDs will rot, and old hardware
21353900	21360380	will fail. One day, computers may struggle to be compatible with older software. One day,
21360380	21366940	emulation might be shut down or strictly regulated. One day, fees may increase. One day,
21366940	21372220	competition may disappear. One day, the indie market may collapse. One day, the console market
21372220	21378940	may collapse. One day, the entire industry may collapse. It certainly has before. The future
21378940	21386140	holds no guarantees, and this is an industry of change. But right now, things aren't as bad as
21386140	21392620	many people might think they are. Good games are being made every single year, and goddamn,
21392620	21399100	is there a lot of good games already out there. Video games have come a long way,
21399660	21407420	and not every change has been for the better. But never before have people had so much choice.
21409020	21409980	Use it wisely.
21415820	21428940	This has been the entire history of video games. Thank you for watching.
21429500	21439580	I promised myself I'd do a Patreon plug here, so here it is. The video is over. I hope you enjoyed
21439580	21446940	it. It took a long time to make, but I think it was worth it. I've been making videos for five
21446940	21452620	years now. In fact, this will probably be up almost exactly on the channel's five-year anniversary.
21453340	21459020	And I am lucky to be in the position I'm in. But the channel growth has slowed a lot recently,
21459500	21463500	and I'm feeling under a lot of pressure to try to satisfy the algorithm.
21464220	21469980	And that's how YouTube goes. But I do feel very limited in what videos I can make.
21470700	21475740	I'd love to make more time-consuming and unique videos, like deep dives into certain areas of
21475740	21481740	the gaming industry. But it is a consistent worry for me how such videos will perform,
21481740	21486540	and whether I can afford to spend hundreds of hours on projects, knowing that a bad
21486540	21490860	Titan or thumbnail could doom the video for a bad click-through rate and so on.
21492300	21497260	For this reason, I'm thinking of trying to promote the Patreon more to try to get myself
21497260	21503100	a little more creative freedom. I've hardly mentioned the Patreon for the past year or so,
21503100	21507820	but I'm going to start promoting it a bit more often, like at the end of videos,
21507820	21513500	as I'm doing now. That's what this is. This is promotion. I don't have much to offer for
21513500	21519740	patrons, but I've revamped the tiers a bit. For $6 you get your name in the credits for videos,
21519740	21525180	but you can give less for that as well, and all patrons get all other benefits,
21525180	21532140	which include detailed monthly updates, the occasional Patreon poll, and access to some
21532140	21537820	unlisted videos which includes a few uncensored videos, a few older videos not on the channel
21537820	21547500	anymore, and a few unique reviews. Other than that, all I can say is I work many hours on these videos,
21547500	21553180	I work long hours, I rarely take breaks, I try my best to maintain a high level of quality,
21553180	21559740	and I do everything on my own. And you don't need to give anything, but it would mean a lot to me
21559740	21569740	if you did. Anyway, thank you for watching regardless, and I'll see you in the next video.
