1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Video games have come a long way. From once being seen as a temporary fad, to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,760
just toys for children, or immoral corruptors of the youth, today the gaming

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,800
industry easily surpasses the film and music industries combined and it's

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,160
still growing. Still, as tempting as it might be to draw comparisons to more

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
established industries, the reality is that video games have proved to be

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,040
something unique. No other industry has been so closely tied to technological

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,560
progress. No industry has ever grown so far so fast and no other industry has

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,000
experienced so much change in such a short time. With multi-billion dollar

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,520
companies rising and falling in the space for a few years and the entire gaming

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,520
landscape being radically changed more than once by a couple guys working out

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,040
of a garage. And all this in something that's only been around about 50 years.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,480
Video games have come a long way and their evolution has been remarkable. Today

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,360
though, more and more people seem to be viewing the industry with pessimism and

14
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,720
despite continued growth, its future doesn't look quite as bright as it once

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,920
did, with companies and consumers alike increasingly seeming to be looking to the

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:31,240
past. So, let's talk about the past. All of it, from the very first game right up

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,120
to where we are today and every major event in between. This is the entire

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,640
history of video games and it begins with something that would end up as a bit of a

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,360
staple for the industry. War.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:58,000
World War II was kind of a big deal. In addition to deciding the fate of a

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,520
global population and shaping the modern world as we know it, it also saw

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,440
rapid technological advancement that would pave the way for something equally

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,800
important. Video games. After building the first ever digital computers for the

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,240
purpose of numerical processing and code-breaking as part of the war effort,

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,360
this technology was subsequently commercialized and found its way to

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,600
several universities. And where computers go, video games soon follow. Of course,

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,320
they weren't exactly designed as video games so much as demonstrations to show

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,520
what computers could do or just experiments to further the field of

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,920
computer science. The first to be shown to the public was Bertie the Brain in

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,560
1950, who played Tic Tac Toe. Poor Bertie was apparently quite good, although

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,640
every photo seems to show him losing and he was dismantled two weeks after the

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,720
exhibition, as tended to be the case with these early computers. The first game to

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,200
be created as entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, a side-on simulation of

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,920
a game of tennis that ran on an analog computer and was created by William

35
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,320
Higginbotham, a man perhaps better known for his role in the creation of the

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:24,600
atomic bomb. Meanwhile in 1962, Space War, a two player 1v1 space battle

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,320
simulation created at MIT, became the first game to see wider distribution as

38
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,400
its source code was shared between students and institutions. As the 60s

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,640
continued, more games were created for the mainframe and mini computers of the

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,600
era, but their popularity was quite limited by the fact that the computers

41
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,760
needed to run these games cost thousands and thousands of dollars, something

42
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,560
affordable for a university but less so for the average family. Things would

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,080
change in the 1970s however as video games started to appear alongside

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,120
Pimble Machines and other mechanical games in arcades. The first arcade video

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,480
game was Computer Space in 1971 which took heavy inspiration from the earlier

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,840
Space War and was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Damby. Computer Space

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,200
saw limited success but its creators still believed in the potential of the

48
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,680
medium so they founded their own company, Atari. At the same time as this, new

49
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,360
breakthroughs were happening elsewhere as in 1972 the first ever home console was

50
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,400
released by electronics company Magnavox. It was called the Odyssey and its

51
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,480
development started six years earlier with the version finally released being

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,480
the seventh successive prototype. The main challenge for team faced was

53
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,400
affordability. The technology for a home console existed, it was just a question

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,320
of how to keep the price low enough that anyone would be willing to manufacture

55
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,520
or buy it. But eventually the team led by Ralph Bear found a way and so video

56
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,640
games at long last came to the American family home. This was an important

57
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,080
milestone although the Odyssey didn't exactly see the runaway success of later

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,920
consoles. Still its simple two-player table tennis game did provide the

59
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,400
inspiration for Atari's first game, a remarkably similar looking future

60
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,520
phenomenon Pong. Released in arcades in late 1972 Pong was a game that changed

61
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,920
gaming proving immensely popular in arcades and at 25 cent a game also

62
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:57,160
immensely profitable. By the end of 72 we did three and a half million dollars and

63
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:04,440
then we did 19 million then we did 35 million hockey stick. In fact Pong was

64
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,120
so popular that the first machine installed quickly stopped working. Atari

65
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,360
were called out to get it going again and found the problem was that the

66
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
cash box had overflowed from the vast amount of quarters leading the machine

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,920
to become jammed. And so arcades exploded in popularity as Pong proved gaming's

68
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,600
potential. Video games had arrived and at the birth of this exciting new medium

69
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,240
where the possibilities are endless how did everyone react you might wonder.

70
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:46,920
Well obviously they copied the one thing everyone knew already worked. Atari

71
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:52,280
made sequels and successors as well as their own dedicated home Pong console

72
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,040
and other companies made their own versions alongside their own sequels

73
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:04,000
and successors and dedicated home systems. Pong was everywhere as profit led

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,960
to proliferation and before long video games were in decline. By the mid 1970s

75
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,360
arcade growth slowed and then shrunk as the market became saturated with Pong

76
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,080
clones and brand new companies that had once rushed to cash in on this big new

77
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,760
thing started going under. Atari themselves fared better although they

78
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,280
had their own troubles by way of a lawsuit that came from Magna Box over

79
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,120
the striking similarities between Pong and their table tennis game. Atari

80
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,760
settled but they weren't the only ones being sued and Magna Box's winnings

81
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,840
ended up totaling over 100 million dollars. And so arcades were struggling

82
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,040
but thanks to technological advancements over the 70s a new prize was up for

83
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,240
grabs and the competition would be intense.

84
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,440
Arcades might have been where video games got their start but home consoles

85
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:13,200
offered an even greater opportunity and people were quick to realize it. In 1975

86
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,440
the year Atari's home Pong released there were seven other companies

87
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,640
releasing home video game consoles of their own. By 1977 there were at least

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,880
82 other companies with 160 different models being released in that year alone.

89
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,760
The consoles from this era were dedicated systems meaning they could only play

90
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,200
one or more built-in games that came included. A lot of these were simply

91
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,720
Pong clones with Atari even taking measures to make the cloning process

92
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,760
more difficult to hinder their rivals. We actually became quite diabolical about

93
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,920
seeing ways that we could just mess them up. We put a chip in and we purposefully

94
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,400
mismarked it so that when somebody copied us they put the wrong chip in. This

95
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,520
didn't stop the market from becoming saturated however but this time a

96
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,400
solution would come through innovation and once more it would be Atari who led

97
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
the way.

98
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,760
The Atari video computer system is 20 cartridges with 1300 game variations you

99
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
play on your own TV set.

100
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:44,960
The Atari video computer system later called the Atari 2600 released in 1977.

101
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,000
One year after the Fairchild Channel F became the first ever console to feature

102
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,520
interchangeable cartridges. Bushnell saw the advantages cartridges provided and

103
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,760
rushed to reduce a cartridge based system of his own but earlier problems with

104
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,400
lawsuits, increasing competition and decline in arcade sales meant Atari's

105
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,600
funds were getting low and so they made a deal with Warner Communications to sell

106
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Atari for $28 million. The consequences of this deal would be seen most clearly

107
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,720
in the following years but for now it meant Atari had the money to finish

108
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,400
their new console to beat out their main rival Magnavox who had released their

109
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:35,560
own cartridge based system the Odyssey 2 in 1978. The Atari 2600 would be huge

110
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,040
with lifetime sales of over 30 million units a number that dwarfs any other

111
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,800
console of the era. Still this success came slowly and in late 1977 the entire

112
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,560
gaming industry experienced its first but by no means last crash. The combination

113
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,400
of a saturated market full of dedicated systems alongside new cartridge based

114
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,440
systems that proved far more desirable meant heaps of dedicated systems

115
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,720
suddenly stopped selling leaving retailers with a surplus of stock they

116
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,280
couldn't shift and causing game developers to cancel most dedicated

117
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,920
systems that were currently in development. The resulting downturn hit the

118
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,840
gaming industry hard leading economists and media figures to speculate whether

119
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,320
the entire gaming industry had simply been a short-lived craze that was now

120
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,040
coming to the end of its life cycle. Amidst this pessimism the Atari 2600

121
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,480
with its relatively high price point of $200 which is almost 1000 after

122
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,080
adjusting for inflation was seen as a tough sell and retailers and consumers

123
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,640
alike were hesitant to embrace it meaning Atari was only able to sell a

124
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,320
fraction of the systems they manufactured in its first few years. Further

125
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,680
competition would also come from other cartridge based systems including the

126
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,400
Intellivision from Mattel and the ColecoVision from Coleco but Atari would

127
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,600
soon find the killer app they needed that would not only get themselves back

128
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,520
in business but would also get the entire gaming industry back on track.

129
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,720
Space Invaders was created by Japanese developer Tomohiro Nishikado at Taito

130
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,400
in 1978 and it is easily one of the most important and influential games ever made.

131
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,280
Before Space Invaders different regions like America, Europe and Japan had

132
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,000
little crossover between them but Space Invaders quickly moved beyond regional

133
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,920
borders to become the first truly global gaming mega hit and that was by no

134
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,400
means its only achievement. Its gameplay may look relatively simple today but

135
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,600
in the 70s it was anything but. As a fixed shooter where the player takes on

136
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,880
rows of gradually descending aliens while hiding behind fully destructible

137
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,640
bunkers it was the first game to have enemies that shoot back at the player.

138
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,720
It helped pioneer the move away from timers over to lives-based systems. It

139
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,200
was the first game to feature a high score system giving it potentially

140
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,320
infinite replayability and it was the first game to feature continuous

141
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,560
background music. The background track itself was dynamic and increased in

142
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,120
tempo in time with the enemies increased movement speed as rounds progressed

143
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,400
giving the action a real sense of tension as the difficulty ramped up. This

144
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,960
iconic part of the game wasn't actually intentional. During its development

145
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,280
Nishikado found that the arcade processor struggled to handle so many

146
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,240
enemies on screen at once and yet as the player took out more and more of them

147
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,120
the render speed increased causing the aliens to move faster and faster. This

148
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,560
created a difficulty curve where the challenge rose and fell within each level

149
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,920
to create moments of higher and lower intensity a principle still seen in

150
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,360
game design to this day. Space Invaders also featured some semblance of a story.

151
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:30,520
Aliens were invading from space and you had to stop them. Okay it's not much but

152
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,120
compared to the more abstract Pong or Breakout it made the action feel much

153
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,160
more contextually meaningful and marked the beginning of arcade games paying

154
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,840
more attention to these kinds of aspects. And if all that wasn't enough there

155
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:53,280
was also the game's sales. By 1982 Space Invaders had grossed 3.8 billion

156
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,760
dollars which is over 13 billion after inflation meaning it was the then best

157
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,520
selling video game and highest grossing entertainment product of all time. For

158
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,880
the industry this meant video games were back and soon it wasn't just Space

159
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,840
Invaders. 1978 marked the beginning of what has since been named the golden age

160
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:24,960
of the arcade. 1979 saw the release of Asteroids from Atari which continued the

161
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,920
space battle theme this time in an asteroid field with more complex physics

162
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,560
based movement while also using cutting-edge vector graphics that utilized

163
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,080
lines instead of pixels to provide a crisp display unlike anything that could

164
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,640
be produced on a home TV screen. The trend of popular arcade games where you

165
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,320
shoot things continued in 1980 with Atari's 3D first-person tank sim

166
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,920
battle zone as well as their trackball controlled missile command which took

167
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,120
inspiration from the still ongoing Cold War to task players with defending

168
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,760
cities from intercontinental ballistic missiles. 1981 gave the world defender

169
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,920
from Williams Electronics which pioneered the side-scrolling shoot-em-up

170
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,840
genre and Gallagher from Namco a fixed shooter which featured complex enemy

171
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,080
patterns and power-ups both features that would define the genre moving forward.

172
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:30,200
Shooters weren't the only thing coming out of arcades though. In 1980 Namco's

173
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,560
Pac-Man gave the world its first gaming mascot Pac-Man well establishing the

174
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,200
maze chased genre and being the first game to feature power-ups. As iconic as

175
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,400
he would go on to become however Pac-Man's path to success wasn't a

176
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,760
simple one. The game initially struggled to beat Namco's 1979 space shooter

177
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,080
Galaxian in Japan while in America publisher Midway was hesitant to

178
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,640
manufacture many units as they were unsure how it would perform. The reason for

179
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,600
this was that it didn't involve any shooting and so executives feared it

180
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,760
would be less popular with arcades mostly male player base. This was something

181
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,800
developer Toru Iwatani had also considered as he deliberately tried to

182
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,520
create a game that would appeal to women as well as men and offer something

183
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,200
different to war or sports hence the colorful design cute characters and

184
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,120
emphasis on eating rather than killing. Iwatani figured that girls like eating

185
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,960
things more than killing them and it seems he was on to something because in

186
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,160
the end players couldn't get enough of Pac-Man's addictive pellet eating action.

187
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,480
Within a year it had become the best-selling arcade game in both Japan

188
00:17:51,480 --> 00:18:00,440
and America outgrossing even the 1977 film Star Wars in revenue. Pac-Man was

189
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,200
one of the first but by no means last times a video game found record

190
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,640
success through broader appeal and targeting new audiences. Its use of

191
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,040
vibrant color and its focus on a central titular character would also go on to

192
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,240
become video game staples and would soon be seen in other popular arcade

193
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:29,400
titles like Konami's 1981 Road and River Crossing hit Frogger. By 1982 color and

194
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,640
3D technology were being combined in even more impressive ways like in Namco's

195
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,960
visually striking racing simulator Pole Position and the arcade Golden Age was

196
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,040
in full swing with profits from games reaching new heights and Taito, Atari

197
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,880
and Namco establishing themselves as the three biggest developers around. Arcades

198
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,360
were more than just a place to play games however. Through features like high

199
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,600
scores, multiplayer and the ability to watch and compete in front of other

200
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,440
people arcades provided a social aspect to gaming that went beyond just playing.

201
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,080
Much like how Twitch allows people to watch, discuss and compete in various

202
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,200
games today arcades were the live streaming and esports of the 20th

203
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,440
century and they offered better gaming experiences than you could get in your

204
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,840
home with higher quality graphics, better sound and unique immersive elements

205
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,040
like wheels and pedals in racing game cabinets. Arcades would also have a

206
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,160
significant impact on future game design. Their quarter hungry monetization

207
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,680
method has sometimes led to criticism over their high difficulty with older

208
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,480
console games also sometimes coming under fire for inheriting that high

209
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,680
difficulty but popular arcade titles knew that if difficulty was the only

210
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,560
thing they had to offer players wouldn't have any reason to keep coming back

211
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,640
and so they learned how to make skill-based challenges fun and make

212
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,840
players want to improve and keep playing. Still as important as arcades were

213
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,040
Space Invaders legacy goes beyond just kicking off the Golden Age of arcades

214
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,960
and breaking sales records because it also turned things around for the home

215
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:23,360
video game market and Atari. In 1980 Space Invaders came to the 2600 allowing

216
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,480
people to play the arcade classic from the comfort of their home. This was the

217
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,680
first arcade to home console port and it wouldn't be the last.

218
00:20:40,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Space Invaders for the 2600 became the first ever killer app or system

219
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:15,280
seller in video game history and it certainly sold systems with Atari's

220
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,800
consumer sales almost doubling to $200 million in the year it released before

221
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:28,000
skyrocketing to over 800 million in 1981 with Atari taking 65% of the global

222
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,040
market share and so the great console battle royale that had defined so much

223
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,760
of the 70s was over and Atari was the runaway winner. A victory that proved to

224
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,520
be surprisingly short-lived.

225
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:56,760
In 1982 Atari was the fastest growing company in American history yet by the

226
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,680
end of 1983 they were one of the fastest falling with yearly losses of over

227
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,960
$500 million amidst the slide in parent company Warner's stock of almost 70%.

228
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,560
In 1984 Atari was sold with Warner receiving no cash for the sale and

229
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:25,600
never again would Atari be a leader in the video game industry. So what happened?

230
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,520
Well there is an obvious answer but that only tells part of the story. To really

231
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,640
understand we need to rewind a bit and look at where Atari came from. When Nolan

232
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,000
Bushnell and Ted Danby decided to start a video game company together they both

233
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,360
pitched in $250 of their own money to get the company off the ground. By 1982

234
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:57,920
Atari had 10,000 employees and were bringing in $1.7 billion in operating

235
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,640
profit and this all happened in the space of around 10 years. Atari had a

236
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,960
colorful history and some important people once worked there including Steve

237
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,240
Jobs and Steve Wozniak who left after a few years to start their own company by

238
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,040
the name of Apple as well as a young programmer by the name of Bill Gates who

239
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,600
was fired for not doing enough work. Atari also had a bit of a reputation for

240
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,960
their relaxed office culture. You know flexible hours, informal dress code, the

241
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,080
usual sort of thing. As we had a lot of young people we would constantly offer to

242
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,320
throw a party if they hit quota and it turns out when you've got 18, 19, 20

243
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,080
year olds they're much more interested in the party than an extra you know 50

244
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,840
cents an hour. So we got known as a party company. There's a story that if you

245
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,680
walked by the Borega Street building and you breathed deeply by the air vents

246
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,120
you'd get stoned because the pot smoking inside of it was so heavy. This made

247
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,840
them a popular place to work but it didn't last. The gaming industry was at

248
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,960
the cutting edge of technology which meant to compete and to win funding was

249
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,100
necessary. Hence the move to become a subsidiary of Warner in 1976 which

250
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:30,240
brought in a 120 million dollar cash injection and made the 2600's 1977

251
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,740
release possible. Warner communications were a big business however meaning

252
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,340
they took a keen interest in how their new subsidiary was being run. To this end

253
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,180
Warner brought in an experienced business exec Ray Kassar in 1978 to help

254
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:53,140
with marketing and commercialization but as the influence of Warner grew so too

255
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,500
did conflict with then CEO Nolan Bushnell particularly over Bushnell's

256
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,340
desire to continue to invest in research and development for new

257
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,740
technologically superior consoles. This ultimately led to Bushnell's departure

258
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,740
in late 1978. He would go on to found American restaurant chain Chuck E Cheese

259
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,380
and Atari went on to soaring new heights now with a more professional work

260
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,500
culture under the oversight of Kassar. Conflict wouldn't end here however.

261
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,620
Atari was succeeding but they were also changing and not everyone was happy with

262
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:36,820
their new direction. In 1979 four experienced Atari programmers David

263
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,100
Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead resigned over Atari's policy

264
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,780
to not credit or provide royalties to the actual game developers. These

265
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,780
engineers would create a software program that would result in twenty thirty

266
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,060
million dollars in sales and they were making this a little paltry salary and

267
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,060
they figured gee I'd like to get a penny or two or three per each cartridge. So we

268
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,900
go to the president of Atari and point that out and he said to us and I'll

269
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,260
quote he said you are no more important to that game than the person on the

270
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,700
assembly line who puts it together. So they figured if they weren't going to

271
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,180
get credit for their work why do that work for someone else which led them to

272
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:26,220
form their own company. Activision the first ever third-party developer who

273
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:32,020
made sure to emphasize the role of game creators on their products. Atari

274
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,220
responded like the true corporate powerhouse they were at this time and

275
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,700
sued Activision but they weren't successful at preventing them from

276
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,020
producing games for Atari consoles and instead a deal was agreed where the

277
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,620
third-party company would pay a portion of their sales as a license fee to the

278
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:55,580
console owner a system that's existed ever since. Activision were only the

279
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,100
start of Atari's problems though. Other senior developers would also jump ship

280
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,940
but it was in early 1982 that marked the beginning of the end when Atari

281
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,220
tried to repeat the earlier magic of their space invaders and asteroids arcade

282
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:19,140
ports with Pac-Man for the 2600. The problem was Pac-Man was no space

283
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:26,940
invaders or asteroids. Released originally in 1980 it ran on 1980s arcade

284
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,820
technology with vibrant color smooth animations and high quality sound. All

285
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:38,940
things for now dated 2600 struggled with. The result is a port that will forever

286
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:45,300
live in infamy as one of the worst of all time a Pac-Man in name and not much

287
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:51,380
else. Still Atari's disappointments that year were only just getting started.

288
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,780
November saw the release of the 5200 Atari's next generation home system

289
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:04,380
which kicked off the 16-bit era. Unfortunately despite being early to the

290
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,300
market there wasn't much else the 5200 had going for it. Its initial price

291
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,460
point of $270 was high, it didn't originally come with backwards

292
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,900
compatibility, there were few new titles released for it and the controller was

293
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,180
widely criticized and while its graphics and hardware were a step up from the

294
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,060
2600 and other 8-bit systems the upgrade they provided was small and poorly

295
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,620
shown by the few titles the 5200 had available which tended to just be

296
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:42,940
ports of 2600 games. Nolan Bushnell is reported to have left Atari over

297
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,620
disagreements with the direction of future console technology and the

298
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:53,660
commercial failure of the Atari 5200 seemed to vindicate his stance. Finally

299
00:28:53,660 --> 00:29:00,780
to top Atari's year off there was E.T. which released just in time for the holiday season.

300
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:40,220
E.T. has regularly been called the worst video game of all time. This may be

301
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,540
rather harsh but history is rarely known for its kindness. Still worst of all time

302
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,860
or not E.T. is certainly symbolic and it's a perfect example of a hubris that

303
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,020
brought Atari's downfall. Atari had acquired a license at high cost for an

304
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:02,220
E.T. game following the success of the movie but they wanted the game released

305
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,820
in time for Christmas to take advantage of increased holiday sales. This meant a

306
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,380
development time of only a few months and so they brought in experienced

307
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,420
developer Howard Scott Warshaw who had just completed the ambitious and

308
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,980
critically acclaimed Yars Revenge. Warshaw embraced a short development time as a unique

309
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:30,500
challenge and tried to do the miraculous. He failed and the result is a confusing

310
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,100
adventure game that had little connection to the original movie beyond its

311
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,860
strangely shaped protagonist. This didn't faze Atari however who skipped

312
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,820
audience testing to save time and produced an optimistic five million copies

313
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:54,300
for retailers only a fraction of which ended up selling. E.T. was a bad game but in this way it

314
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,700
wasn't unique. In fact after the success of Activision more and more developers

315
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,900
entered the third party space. This was before game developers needed a license

316
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,860
to publish games on consoles which created a free-for-all where quality was a

317
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,020
much smaller concern than profit and where accusations of industrial

318
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,940
espionage and reverse engineering became rampant due to third party developers lack

319
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,540
of familiarity with the hardware of the system they were designing games for. By

320
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,700
the start of 1983 at least 100 different companies were developing games for the

321
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:37,900
2600 in a rush to cash in on the now booming video game craze. In the process

322
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,100
quality control was often ignored and in this period consumers had few ways to

323
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,900
differentiate between good and bad games before it was already too late. As the

324
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,740
market continued to become increasingly saturated with low quality games

325
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,740
retailers were forced to discount stock to try to get rid of these games

326
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,420
encouraging consumers to continue purchasing the now discounted bad games

327
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,860
leading to a loss of consumer confidence which even video game Titan Atari

328
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,580
wasn't exempt from. In fact Atari likely deserved more of the blame than anyone.

329
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:24,740
Pac-Man for the 2600 was a bad game but it was also the best selling video game

330
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,260
of all time and even then Atari still produced far more copies than they

331
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:37,300
ultimately sold. And so with a saturated market little quality control rapidly

332
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,660
depleting consumer confidence and even more emergent competition from the

333
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,180
home computer market the gaming industry did the inevitable and sunk

334
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,660
spectacularly in the great gaming crash of 1983.

335
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,580
Video game sales have gone tilt the boom simply isn't booming anymore.

336
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,980
If Pac-Man, ET and Raiders of the Lost Ark aren't selling what will.

337
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,420
To understand the scale of this disaster it helps to look at the numbers. In 1983

338
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:17,900
home video game revenues peaked at 3.2 billion dollars. By 1985 this number

339
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:27,220
had fallen to 100 million a decrease of almost 97%. Once quarterly earnings

340
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,500
started to reveal the degree to which games had stopped selling investors

341
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,140
started panicking cashing out their gaming stock and effectively ending the

342
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,420
supply of new money that had previously supported the once growing market. As a

343
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:47,260
result many newer gaming companies went bankrupt. Mattel, Coleco and Magnavox

344
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,780
all discontinued their gaming lines entirely and Atari was sold for almost

345
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,220
nothing with hundreds of thousands of on-soul games being famously dumped

346
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:03,740
and buried in a landfill in New Mexico. Arcades still saw some popularity but

347
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,900
they once more entered into a period of decline with the golden age having now

348
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:15,580
come to an abrupt end. And so video games were officially over being once more

349
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,100
seen as nothing but a short-lived fad not so different from other popular

350
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,780
toy lines that burn bright and then burn out once consumers get bored of them.

351
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,060
And this is how they would continue to be seen in America for the next two years

352
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:43,260
until a new name entered the scene. While the American gaming industry crashed

353
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:49,660
and burned in 1983 across the Pacific in gaming's second largest market the year

354
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,740
would be remembered for a different reason. The release of the Nintendo

355
00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:00,900
family computer also known as the Famicom. It wasn't until 1985 that

356
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,540
Nintendo would bring their new console across the Pacific and rescue the

357
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,940
American gaming industry but for Nintendo the story starts much earlier.

358
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,660
Founded in 1889 Nintendo began life as a playing card manufacturer before

359
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,580
diversifying into tabletop games and eventually electronic toys. Their first

360
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,940
foray into video games came from making light gun accessories but in 1977 they

361
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,140
went a step further with the release of the Color TV game a Japanese only

362
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,300
dedicated home console inspired by the success of Magnavox and Atari which

363
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:48,300
contained Pong in six different variants. In Nintendo's defense at least they paid

364
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,740
Magnavox for a license unlike most. The Color TV game sold well thanks in part to

365
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,140
its modest price and Nintendo went on to reduce several more variants all for

366
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,700
their home market of Japan. They also entered the arcade space with a game

367
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,980
based on the board game of Fellow. It was during this period but a fresh faced

368
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,820
25 year old by the name of Shigeru Miyamoto joined the company but Miyamoto

369
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:22,260
would not be Nintendo's first gaming superstar. That honor belongs to one

370
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,100
Gunpei Yokoi head of Nintendo's research and development one division and

371
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:33,900
creator of the iconic handheld game and watch. Apparently inspired by Yokoi

372
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,460
watching a bored businessman playing with an LCD calculator on a train the

373
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,180
game and watch was an early dedicated handheld with an LCD display and fixed

374
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:50,420
animations. It also pioneered the D-pad. In expensive and long running the game

375
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,260
and watch's sales blew most early handheld competition out of the water

376
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,140
selling more units than even Atari's 2600 over the course of its lifetime but

377
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,900
Nintendo was only just getting started. After several less successful arcade

378
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:13,060
attempts the company's next big break came with 1981's Donkey Kong designed by

379
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,260
Miyamoto with the oversight of Yokoi it was originally developed as a way to

380
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,540
reuse old cabinets of Miyamoto's previous and rather less successful

381
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:28,300
radar scope. Donkey Kong took inspiration from Popeye and featured the titular

382
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,660
ape as the game's barrel-throwing antagonist alongside the player controlled

383
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,620
jump man who would go on to become one of the most recognizable characters in

384
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,940
the world after he was renamed to Mario. Donkey Kong was one of the earliest

385
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,020
platformers and the first game to feature jumping. It also broke new ground

386
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,700
in narrative design featuring a complete storyline told entirely on screen

387
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,300
with Donkey Kong kidnapping Mario's girlfriend who the player then works to

388
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:04,340
rescue before finally watching the two be reunited. It was also a massive hit

389
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,540
establishing Nintendo's name internationally and creating a bid and war

390
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,860
between console rivals Atari and Coleco over the rights to publish it. Nintendo

391
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,580
would follow Donkey Kong with multiple sequels but it was their return to home

392
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:29,220
consoles that would change the gaming industry forever. At first glance the

393
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:35,180
Famicom didn't look that remarkable. It was an 8-bit system in a time when Atari

394
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,700
had already given the world 16 bits of power and home computers were quickly

395
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,300
becoming more powerful still. Yet the Famicom did have a dedicated picture

396
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:51,260
processing unit in addition to its CPU as well as a reasonable launch price of

397
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,980
just under 15,000 yen. Its greatest asset would eventually be its game

398
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,540
selection but an impressive library took time and the Famicom's first year on

399
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:07,020
the Japanese market saw it get off to a slow start. It would pick up momentum

400
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,300
eventually however and the great gaming crash of 1983 didn't have nearly as

401
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,300
large an impact on Japan as it did America meaning by the end of 1984

402
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,620
Nintendo's family computer had become the best-selling console in Japan and

403
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:28,500
was well on its way to becoming Nintendo's greatest success yet. This still

404
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:34,620
left Nintendo's toughest challenge though America which in 1985 was still

405
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,980
reeling from the earlier crash with confidence in video games at an all-time

406
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:44,740
low. To get retailers to even stock their console Nintendo had to make buyback

407
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,500
deals in case of poor sales but that still left the even bigger problem of

408
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:55,740
selling the console in the first place. I mean how do you sell a gaming console to

409
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,340
a country that doesn't want anything to do with video games? Well Nintendo's

410
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,940
answer was to pretend that it was something different.

411
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,100
The extraordinary video robot he follows the commands you put on screen to help

412
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,380
you tackle even the toughest challenge. Will you be the first to raise the

413
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,380
incredibly accurate zapper and play games like Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley. The

414
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,700
first to build a library of game packs like Kung Fu and Golf. Even games like

415
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,140
Excitebite that you program yourself. Will you be the first to get all this in

416
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,500
one package? The Nintendo Entertainment System where video technology is more

417
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,300
than a game. Enter the Nintendo Entertainment System not just a

418
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,340
video game console but something brand new and it wasn't just about the name.

419
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,260
The NES was designed to look like a video cassette recorder rather than a

420
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,980
console. Its cartridges were rebranded as game packs and it shipped with several

421
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:17,420
accessories like the robotic operating buddy Rob and the iconic light gun which

422
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,780
marketing made sure to emphasize as much as possible. Nintendo's work didn't

423
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,020
stop here though as they had an entire gaming market to rebuild and so the

424
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,660
number one priority became restoring consumer trust in video games. To do

425
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,940
this they strictly controlled third-party development putting limitations on

426
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:43,460
companies to avoid the oversaturation that have plagued Atari. In Japan this

427
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,380
led to a growing bootleg market so with the NES Nintendo added a special

428
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,660
lockout chip to combat this while creating an official Nintendo seal of

429
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,980
approval to allow buyers to identify Nintendo licensed products. And as for

430
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,620
those products Nintendo also paved the way for their console launch with arcade

431
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:11,340
releases of the same games through the Nintendo versus system in 1984 which was

432
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,620
built on similar hardware to the Famicom. This not only helped spread Nintendo's

433
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,260
name before the release of the NES but also established a trend of console

434
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:26,260
titles matching the quality of their arcade counterparts to try to repair the

435
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:33,740
damage of games like Pac-Man for the 2600. Nintendo even shifted to using in-game

436
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,180
like box art in place of the detailed yet dissimilar artwork of so many earlier

437
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:46,140
games. All this had an impact but Nintendo had one final ace up their sleeve

438
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:51,420
which came once more from the mind of Shigeru Miyamoto and would mark the

439
00:42:51,420 --> 00:43:00,180
arrival of gaming's next killer app. Released in the same year as the NES

440
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:06,500
Super Mario Bros set a new standard. For years players had grown accustomed to

441
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,820
games taking place on a single screen and then in came Mario with side-scrolling

442
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:18,620
platforming action across multiple screens, multiple levels, multiple

443
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,660
environments and all with different power-ups, boss fights and jaw-dropping

444
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:29,100
hidden secrets. To top it all off Super Mario featured precise controls that took

445
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:35,060
full advantage of Nintendo's new D-pad controllers alongside detailed vibrant

446
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,140
visuals and one of the most iconic soundtracks in video game history from

447
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:46,420
composer Koji Kondo. Mario even had a strong sense of identity. By this point

448
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,460
in time a lot of games had featured space combat, sport simulations and fighting

449
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:58,180
but Mario offered something genuinely unique. You played as a shape-changing

450
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,900
mushroom-eating turtle-stomping Italian plumber who warped between worlds while

451
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,700
searching for a princess and somehow the concept worked with a childlike charm

452
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:16,820
that appealed to all ages. And so Super Mario Bros was a landmark title that

453
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,780
kicked off the greatest selling video game franchise of all time but it's not

454
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:28,380
like the NES only had Mario. In fact only a year and a half later the Nintendo

455
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,300
entertainment system would see the arrival of another gaming legend once

456
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:44,060
more from the mind of Miyamoto. The legend of Zelda did to action adventure games

457
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:49,540
what Super Mario Bros did to platformers. With a massive fantasy world fully

458
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:54,300
open to players and packed with secrets Zelda offered a sense of adventure and

459
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:00,100
freedom to explore never before seen in a console game. It was also the first

460
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,940
console game to feature a save system thanks to battery-powered memory built

461
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,540
into the game's cartridge which helped support its more ambitious design. And

462
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:18,500
once more the legend of Zelda was a huge critical and commercial success. As time

463
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,660
went on the NES's impressive library grew and grew launching many of gaming's

464
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,660
most loved series and establishing many of the rules of game design that would

465
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,580
continue to be seen for years to come. Castlevania brought action-packed Gothic

466
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:38,180
horror, Metroid brought atmospheric sci-fi, Mega Man offered alternative high

467
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,860
quality platforming action, Metal Gear helped popularize the stealth genre and

468
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:48,020
Dragon Quest and for later Final Fantasy established the Japanese console

469
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,900
role-playing genre. The NES was also well supported by high quality arcade

470
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:59,860
ports like Ghosts and Goblins, Contra and Double Dragon as well as a range of

471
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:06,420
Nintendo original sports games providing even more diversity. Basically the NES

472
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,140
had everything and it conquered the American and later European console

473
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:17,740
markets getting the gaming industry back in business in the process. This didn't

474
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,900
happen overnight and the damage done to the American market really was

475
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:28,020
significant but by 1989 the console market had finally bounced back close to

476
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:34,100
earlier levels with consumer confidence largely restored. Over its lifetime the

477
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,940
NES and Famicom sold around 62 million units which was more than double the

478
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,780
Atari 2600 making the NES the best-selling console of the time and

479
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,740
still one of the best-selling to this day. And with Nintendo's console

480
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,580
supremacy and so many American companies having exited the market

481
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,100
following the earlier crash, Japan was able to take center stage of the gaming

482
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:04,740
industry with Nintendo's name becoming synonymous with video games. Still even if

483
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,100
Nintendo had taken a sizable lead they wouldn't remain unchallenged for long

484
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:14,540
as another Japanese company was about to make their attempt at beating Nintendo

485
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,100
at their own game.

486
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,980
Sega was a big name in arcades. They entered the Japanese home console market

487
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,180
at the same time as Nintendo when the arcade Golden Age was starting to wind

488
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:39,700
down. Their first console the SG-1000 released in 1983 on the very same day

489
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,740
as Nintendo's Famicom but it would struggle to compete with Nintendo's

490
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,180
superior system likely as a result of Sega's inexperience with console

491
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:56,700
development. In 1985 it was redesigned as the Sega Mark 3 which released in

492
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,300
North America in 1986 as the Sega Master System.

493
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:35,620
The Master System went head-to-head with the NES while copying much of its

494
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,900
marketing strategy. In terms of hardware it had a clear advantage with a wider

495
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,860
color palette and a small edge in raw power but this wouldn't be enough to

496
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:52,660
make up for its biggest weakness its lack of third-party support. To publish games

497
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:58,820
on the NES licensees had to agree to a strict two-year non-compete clause that

498
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:04,460
didn't allow them to bring their titles to Nintendo's competition. This left the

499
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,980
Master System with a much smaller library and while Sega were able to bring

500
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,420
their own first-party arcade titles including the fast-paced rail shooter

501
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,420
Space Harrier and iconic racing game Outrun two of the best arcade titles of

502
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,180
the mid-80s this ultimately didn't prove to be enough and even these games

503
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:29,300
were still inferior on console than as arcade originals. This ensured that

504
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,220
Sega failed to come close to matching Nintendo in Japan or North America

505
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,820
although they did do enough to overtake a flagging Atari who under new

506
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:44,780
management had released their own third-generation console the 7800 a system

507
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:50,740
notable for its innovative backwards compatibility and little else. Still by

508
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:56,220
this point gaming was global and so Sega turned their attention to other markets.

509
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,540
In Europe the NES had failed to achieve the same level of success as in America

510
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:06,500
with Nintendo taking a more hands-off approach and leaving the distribution to

511
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:12,300
other companies. It also arrived notably late with most countries not seeing the

512
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:18,780
NES until 1987. This was the same year Sega brought over the Master System and

513
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,620
with no more head start and Sega's strong reputation as an arcade developer

514
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:31,060
Sega started to beat Nintendo for the very first time. By 1990 the Master

515
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:37,060
System was Europe's best-selling console and Sega didn't stop at Europe. In fact

516
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:42,100
a deal with toy and electronics company Tectoy saw Brazil become the Master

517
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:48,860
System's single best-selling country after its release in 1989. By contrast the

518
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:55,140
NES didn't come to Brazil until 1993 giving Sega a unique chance to capture a

519
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,340
by no means insignificant market. Sega wouldn't be the only new challenger

520
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,380
amidst the now once more growing gaming industry however.

521
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:43,420
Hudson Soft and NEC's Turbografics 16 released in 1987 in Japan under the name

522
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:50,740
PC Engine and in 1989 in America and Europe. The console was so eager to let

523
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:55,100
consumers know that it was a 16-bit rather than 8-bit system that it

524
00:51:55,100 --> 00:52:01,060
included it in the name kicking off what is sometimes referred to as the Bit Wars

525
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:07,300
as well as the fourth generation of home consoles. As the first truly next-gen

526
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,620
system the Turbografics did boast some impressive hardware with a higher

527
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:18,420
resolution and expanded color palette to go alongside its 16-bit GPU. This was

528
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,580
matched with some impressive sales in its home region of Japan with the system

529
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,340
getting off to a flying start and beating out the NES in its year of

530
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,940
release. Unfortunately this strong performance wasn't replicated in other

531
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,420
regions with poor marketing and a delayed release leading to commercial

532
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:41,900
failure in North America and cancelled plans in Europe. Still for Sega this new

533
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:47,060
competition represented a clear threat and so in response they immediately began

534
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:53,740
working on their own 16-bit system. It was finished one year later long before

535
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,300
Nintendo would have a 16-bit system themselves and it turned out to be

536
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,420
Sega's best console yet.

537
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:36,260
The Sega Genesis otherwise known as the Mega Drive outside America released in

538
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:44,900
1988 in Japan, 1989 in America and 1990 in other regions and with it Sega now had

539
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:50,020
a system powerful enough to do justice to their expansive arcade library as well

540
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:56,820
as a clear technological lead on their main rival Nintendo. They even had a new

541
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,940
marketing slogan.

542
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:23,660
And so heading into the next decade the console war was finally heating up with

543
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:29,660
one of gaming's greatest rivalries about one-fold. The only thing Sega still

544
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,980
needed was a killer app of their own that could finally go head-to-head with

545
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:41,300
Nintendo's popular mascot Mario. But for Nintendo there was no reason to panic

546
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:46,740
just yet as the end of the 80s saw them release a new system of their own one

547
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,940
that would go on to outsell all of their previous systems combined.

548
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:03,940
Nintendo's Game & Watch was a success but its LCD technology limited it to one

549
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:09,700
game per system. For Gunpei Yokoi's next console he wanted to create a handheld

550
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,740
device with interchangeable games that offered an NES-like experience on the

551
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,740
go. This was the result.

552
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:52,620
The Game Boy released in 1989 and was around in various iterations for the

553
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:58,500
next 20 years during which Nintendo dominated the handheld market the

554
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:05,140
entire time. It did require four AA batteries but this was a price players

555
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:11,220
were more than happy to pay. It also lacked a backlight which was more of an

556
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,500
issue. A contrast dial was included but this still meant the system was

557
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,380
unplayable without a light source and even in a well-lit environment the gray

558
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:27,220
and green color scheme didn't provide the best clarity or general aesthetic. To

559
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,380
make matters worse the Game Boy released against heavy competition with three

560
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,220
other handhelds also vying for dominance at the same time. Atari's Lynx,

561
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:44,220
Sega's Game Gear and NEC's Turbo Express. All three of these rivals blew the

562
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:50,060
Game Boy away in technical capabilities featuring not only a backlit screen but

563
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:55,740
also full-color and far more impressive graphics. By comparison the drab

564
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:00,860
grays and greens of the Game Boy must have seemed rather pathetic. A sentiment

565
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:05,900
held by many even at Nintendo during its development where the Game Boy had earned

566
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:14,300
the nickname DUMMER GAME a pun which basically translates to BAD GAME. In the

567
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,460
end though the Game Boy wound up punching far above its weight and easily

568
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,140
surpassed all competition proving that in the constantly advancing battleground

569
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:27,980
of cutting-edge technology that is the gaming industry sometimes having the

570
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:33,020
best specs isn't what matters the most. You see in return for a less

571
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,100
technologically advanced product Nintendo offered something at a more

572
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:42,460
affordable price with a much longer battery life and a durable more

573
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:48,700
child-proof design. If success was down to critics the Game Boy would have come

574
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:54,380
last. In reality however success is decided by the consumer which in this

575
00:57:54,380 --> 00:58:00,860
case often meant parents and it turned out that in this example practicality

576
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:07,260
and affordability beat superior technology and it wasn't even close. For

577
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,100
Gunpei Yokoi this must have been the ultimate vindication of his design

578
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,740
philosophy which has been translated as lateral thinking with

579
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:21,100
withered technology i.e achieving success through finding new and

580
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:27,980
innovative ways to use cheap or mature technology. In an industry obsessed with

581
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,980
the cutting-edge this has been successfully employed by Nintendo

582
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:37,180
time and time again and despite Yokoi's unfortunate death in 1997

583
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:42,140
his philosophy can still be seen within the company to this day.

584
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,300
Of course this is only part of the Game Boy's success story

585
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:51,900
because it also had another advantage over the competition.

586
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:57,020
Designed inside the Soviet Union by Alexey Pachinov in 1984

587
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:02,860
Tetris began life as more of a benchmark than an actual video game.

588
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,700
In a time long before anyone could ask can it play crisis

589
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,700
computer engineer Pachinov had to settle for developing his own games

590
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,100
as a way to test the capabilities of the latest hardware.

591
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,700
The idea for Tetris came from trying to recreate the puzzle game

592
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:24,700
Pentominos when Pachinov had the idea to make the pieces descend vertically.

593
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,260
The lack of a graphical interface on the Electronica 60 Pachinov was working on

594
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:34,140
did pose a slight problem but it wasn't enough to stop Tetris's core idea from

595
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,740
being enjoyable and soon Pachinov was sharing his

596
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:42,700
creation with his friends and eventually making an IBM PC version

597
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:47,180
with the help of a talented 16 year old school student.

598
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,460
From here Tetris spread like a contagious virus

599
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,940
first infecting Pachinov's office then the whole Academy of Science

600
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:59,020
before moving across Moscow and then beyond

601
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,220
doing what few Soviet citizens of the time could do

602
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,020
and crossing the Iron Curtain. This kicked off a race from multiple eager

603
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,580
parties to acquire the rights of the game for broader distribution in the west.

604
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,660
The only problem with the situation was that the Soviet Union

605
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,780
didn't really believe in copyright law

606
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,700
outside of everything should be controlled by the state

607
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,500
leading to confusion over who owned the rights of the game

608
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,700
and a complicated battle between different competing parties

609
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,220
with plenty of buying and selling of rights that sellers

610
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:37,980
didn't actually own. The ultimate winner was game designer Henk Rogers

611
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:43,740
who acquired the rights for Nintendo. The original plan for the Game Boy was to

612
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,820
sell it alongside the new Mario title Super Mario Land

613
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:51,900
but Nintendo was so impressed by Tetris after Rogers showed it to them

614
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,580
that they followed his advice to use it instead

615
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,380
in the hopes that its simple addictive nature

616
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,540
could transcend experience age and gender barriers

617
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:07,420
to be a game that everyone could enjoy and it was.

618
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,340
At first glance Tetris might seem similar to popular arcade games of 10

619
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:15,340
years earlier but with no concerns about maximizing quarters

620
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,540
Tetris considerably lowered the initial difficulty

621
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,700
and this did result in a game that anyone could play

622
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,860
as it eased people into the experience while naturally building tension and

623
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:30,940
excitement as the game progressed. Tetris required

624
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,980
fast moment-to-moment reactions as well as broader

625
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,580
more strategic planning and when players made a mistake

626
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:42,140
it was obvious where they went wrong and what they could do better next time.

627
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,660
For the pick up and play Game Boy it was a perfect match

628
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,940
and it went on to sell tens of millions of copies

629
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,060
on Nintendo's new system alone as well as many millions more

630
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:58,460
across PC NES and later mobile versions

631
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,540
making it potentially the best selling game ever made

632
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:08,220
even to this day. This helped the Game Boy get off to a strong start right from its

633
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,140
launch which meant as the 80s grew to a close

634
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:16,700
Nintendo retained their dominant position as leaders of the gaming industry

635
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:22,780
having far surpassed Atari and held off the new challenge presented by Sega.

636
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,340
All this time however as console and arcade giants froze and fell

637
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:31,260
another section of the industry experienced its own story

638
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:35,180
one with a different starting place, different games

639
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,660
and a very different impact on the future.

640
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:50,060
World War II was kind of a big deal. In addition to deciding the fate of a

641
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,900
global population and shaping the modern world as we know it

642
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,500
it also saw rapid technological advancement that would pave the way for

643
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:02,860
something equally important, the home computer.

644
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:07,740
Originally computer game development was limited to only the most enthusiastic

645
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,060
hobbyists. This started in the early 70s with one

646
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:17,820
of the first and most well-known examples being 1971's Star Trek a

647
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,180
text-based strategy game where players took control of the USS

648
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,500
enterprise to hunt down Klingon warships.

649
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:31,180
Other early examples include Oregon Trail a text-based strategy game best known

650
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:36,300
via its later incarnations 1976's Colossal Cave Adventure

651
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,900
a text-based adventure game inspired by real-life caving

652
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:45,900
and Dungeons and Dragons 1977's Empire a turn-based war game

653
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:52,540
inspired by the board game Risk Zork also in 1977 and also a text-based

654
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:55,980
adventure game inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure

655
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,820
and Mud or Multi-User Dungeon a text-based

656
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:07,660
real-time multiplayer role-playing game that helped pioneer the MMO genre in 1978.

657
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:12,060
Of these six examples all except Colossal Cave Adventure

658
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:18,300
were created by students. In fact Star Trek was created by a high school

659
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,140
student who had started hanging around the University of California Irving's

660
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:27,820
computer lab in his free time. So for computer games it was teenagers who

661
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,540
led the way maybe due to the younger generation's

662
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,220
inherent creativity but also because computers were so expensive

663
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:38,220
that university students were some of the only people who had reliable access

664
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,380
to them. This started to change in 1977

665
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:47,020
with the arrival of not one but three more affordable home computers

666
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:52,060
the Commodore PET, the TRS-80 and the Apple II.

667
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:55,020
If you want to know what affordable means

668
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,620
in numerical form well the most successful of these

669
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:08,860
the Apple II cost $1,298 at release which is over $6,400 after inflation.

670
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:14,220
So maybe not affordable for most but it was a start.

671
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:18,300
These early computers tended to ship with some games included

672
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:24,060
but they also came with something else. Basic, a general purpose programming

673
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:28,380
language that gave computer owners not just the ability to play games

674
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:33,340
but also to make them themselves and they did.

675
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,380
The best known example of this is Sierra Online

676
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:40,300
founded by husband and wife duo Ken and Roberta Williams

677
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,900
after playing Colossal Cave Adventure and deciding to make their own

678
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:48,220
similar game on a family member's borrowed Apple II.

679
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,580
The result was the first ever graphical adventure game

680
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,340
Mystery House, a murder mystery focused game

681
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:59,980
inspired by Agatha Christie novels and one of the earliest examples of both

682
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:05,180
graphics in a PC game and horror in any video game.

683
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,620
Sierra Online went on to have numerous hits including

684
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:14,140
King's Quest, Leisure Suit Larry and Quest for Glory.

685
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:18,940
Another example is a Calabeth, the first ever computer role-playing game

686
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:23,580
made by a teenage Richard Garriott in 1979

687
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,900
originally on his school's mainframe pc and finished on an Apple II

688
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:32,060
bought by his father. Garriott sold the game at his local

689
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:37,740
computer store in a ziplock bag with a cover sheet drawn by his mom

690
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:41,580
until a copy of the game made it to California Pacific Computer Company

691
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,620
who signed the deal with Garriott to take over publication

692
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:50,460
and sold 30,000 copies. The founders of Codemasters, the Darling Brothers, have a

693
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:54,700
similar story where they became wealthy and established game

694
01:06:54,700 --> 01:07:00,620
developers by the ripe old age of 16 and 17 selling

695
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:06,700
games by mail order from their bedroom. Arcade and console gaming became

696
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,580
corporate almost as soon as it came into existence

697
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,980
but by contrast the computer gaming industry was heavily grass roots

698
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,220
with hobbyists, bedroom coders and literal children

699
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:22,540
often leading the way laying the foundations for the entire industry

700
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,860
and proving just what these new home computers were capable of.

701
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:31,660
This did mean the PC scene was much slower to monetize their efforts

702
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,500
with piracy known at the time as sharing

703
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:38,860
being such common practice that many people weren't even aware it could be

704
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,460
considered wrong and what started as sharing between

705
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:46,300
friends quickly evolved into selling bootleg copies for a fraction of the

706
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,460
original price. The differences between computer

707
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,740
and console gaming doesn't stop here though

708
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:58,220
from the higher age of the average player to the higher price of the systems

709
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:02,220
to the vastly different control schemes to regional differences

710
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:05,900
with PC gaming particularly flourishing in Europe the same region where

711
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:10,700
consoles caught on the slowest. PC gaming basically grew up independently

712
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,940
to the rest of the gaming industry and nowhere is this more evident

713
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:20,700
than in actual game design. Arcade games started off simple.

714
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,740
They were highly replayable and fiendishly challenging

715
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:27,740
in large part due to their monetization and they tended to focus

716
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:33,260
on skill-based gameplay experiences that came alongside arcade specific features

717
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:39,260
like high scores and lives. Console games then grew out of this foundation

718
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:44,220
with Atari and Sega owing much of their console success to their arcade ports

719
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,660
and the NES's library being packed with games which

720
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:52,300
emulated many aspects of popular arcade titles of the era.

721
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,140
PC games however were quick to embrace complexity.

722
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:00,460
Text adventures like Zork gave players a staggering amount of freedom in their

723
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,620
text inputs while mods did similar while adding in

724
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:10,140
other human players as well. 1980s genre pioneer Rogue

725
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:14,300
offered a huge randomly generated world for players to progress through.

726
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:18,220
Groundbreaking RPGs like 1981's Wizardry or

727
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,740
Ultima provided deep dungeon-crawling overworld

728
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:27,420
spanning adventures with plenty of statistics, classes and items.

729
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,620
In many of these titles gameplay seemed to take a backseat

730
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:36,220
to trying to simulate a rich virtual world for players to become immersed in.

731
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,940
Many of these games were still highly challenging

732
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,140
but less emphasis was placed on constant fail states

733
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:46,940
and replayability with difficulty instead often coming from

734
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:51,980
depth and low fidelity visuals be they text,

735
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:57,420
ASCII or spreadsheet were often embraced as a way to provide greater freedom

736
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:00,700
and maybe as a way for programmers to avoid learning to draw

737
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:06,460
or hiring artists. In time many of these differentiators would become less clear

738
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:10,620
as the borders between PC and console would gradually erode

739
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,900
with Japanese role-playing games being an obvious example of

740
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:18,300
cross-pollination but this process occurred slowly

741
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,420
and many of these same differences between computer games

742
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,980
and their console cousins are still evident today.

743
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,820
Still as the 80s evolved so too did the home computer

744
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:34,460
with systems becoming more affordable amidst rising competition.

745
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,660
It seems everybody is interested now in home computers

746
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:41,020
well so far home computers are just a fraction

747
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,380
a small fraction of those being sold in the United States

748
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:47,980
but because our technology is growing by leaps and bounds

749
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,180
computers can help us with a lot of household items

750
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,860
for grown-ups as well as for the kids. The next generation of computers would

751
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:59,740
include the ZX series from Sinclair, NEC's PC series,

752
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:05,980
the Atari 8-bit family, the BBC Micro and the Amstrad CPC.

753
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:09,660
The best selling of these was the Commodore 64

754
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:14,620
which released just under $600 and holds the world record as the highest

755
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:18,460
selling single computer model of all time.

756
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:21,900
At the same time as this computing heavyweight IBM

757
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,900
launched their now iconic personal computer series

758
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:31,580
popularizing the term PC. These came with Microsoft's DOS operating

759
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:36,620
system and supported open software development for the first time.

760
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,700
Before this all home computers were incompatible systems

761
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,660
meaning all programs had to be ported to specific systems

762
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:47,420
to meet the individual hardware requirements of each one.

763
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:51,020
The IBM PC and its many subsequent clones

764
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:54,140
instead allowed software to be ported much more easily

765
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:58,540
which ultimately greatly benefited game development.

766
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,980
Hardware wasn't the only thing improving in this period though.

767
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:06,780
By the mid-80s PC games were also making impressive strides.

768
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,700
1984's King Quest from Sierra showed the evolution of the graphic adventure

769
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:15,100
genre with an animated protagonist and interactive world.

770
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:19,820
Space Sim Elite broke new ground by adding advanced 3D graphics

771
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:25,340
and action gameplay into an incredibly deep and open space sandbox.

772
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:29,420
Ultima 4 in 1985 set a new standard for role-playing games

773
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,860
by moving them beyond their established dungeon crawler formula

774
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:36,940
with a more expansive world, a richer more nuanced story

775
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:40,860
and a new moral choice-driven approach to game design.

776
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:45,100
1987's Dungeon Master on the other hand evolved the dungeon crawler

777
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:50,300
into the realm of 3D with added real-time combat elements.

778
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,380
The 80s also saw the merging of entertainment and education

779
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:59,020
in several fondly remembered edutainment games.

780
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:04,140
The 1985 version of the Oregon Trail taught children history

781
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,020
as well as the dangers of dysentery, typhoid and rivers.

782
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:14,140
While the also released in 1985 where in the world is Carmen San Diego

783
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:19,020
taught geography and the dangers of art theft.

784
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,140
Of course the Oregon Trail was also an enjoyable strategy game

785
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:26,460
with genuine emergent storytelling and rogue-like random generation

786
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,420
years before rogue even existed and where in the world is Carmen San Diego

787
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:36,540
was a very well made adventure game with strong replayability.

788
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,220
In some ways the educational elements of such games were light

789
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:43,500
but that didn't stop them showing up in thousands of schools

790
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:47,180
tricking children into learning or tricking teachers

791
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:52,060
into letting children play games during school depending on your perspective.

792
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:56,060
Ultimately edutainment computer games were a trend which

793
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:59,500
didn't really catch on but they still serve as a valuable reminder

794
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,500
of a time when gaming was in its infancy and developers were exploring

795
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,580
novel applications of this new exciting medium.

796
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:11,100
By the end of the 80s the era of bedroom coders

797
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,900
was coming to a close with husband and wife duos and pioneering teenagers

798
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:20,700
soon being replaced or going on to found legitimate development teams

799
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:26,540
with professional work environments. One such company, Electronic Arts, would

800
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,860
see a major breakthrough within 1988 John Madden Football

801
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,900
a game which would not only kick off one of the industry's largest sports

802
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,700
series but also showed the more mainstream direction

803
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,900
PC games were now heading in. 1988 also saw the release of

804
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:46,140
Pool of Radiance the first in a long line of Gold Box Dungeons and Dragons

805
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,500
RPGs where after years of video games taking

806
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:53,340
inspiration from D&D they were now finally starting to make that

807
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:57,580
relationship official. With home computers continuing to

808
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:01,260
become more affordable PC gaming ended the decade in a promising

809
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:04,540
place. Its early years should perhaps best be

810
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:09,100
remembered as a time of innovation and enthusiasm.

811
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:14,060
The computer gaming market started small. Popularity was created through word of

812
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:18,780
mouth and sharing between friends. Creators enjoyed unprecedented levels

813
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:22,540
of creative freedom and monetization was often a distant

814
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:26,140
afterthought. Yet many of the games produced from this

815
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:30,300
era were just as impressive as their console and arcade rivals

816
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:36,060
albeit often in very different ways. Regardless the impact of these games on

817
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:40,380
the industry was considerable and gaming wasn't the only thing

818
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:44,140
they impacted. In a time where the personal computer

819
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:48,380
was a brand new invention computer games also played a significant role

820
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:52,140
in showcasing just what this new piece of technology could do

821
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:56,140
and in popularizing the idea that a computer could be more than just a

822
01:15:56,140 --> 01:16:00,460
machine for work. And so even if the history of computer

823
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:03,660
games stands somewhat separate to the rest of the industry

824
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:07,420
it still played a vital role and its importance would only grow

825
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:10,540
as the years went by.

826
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:20,300
Gaming's early years were tumultuous with lawsuits bankruptcy and corporate

827
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,980
takeovers coming alongside innovations and breakthroughs

828
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:27,180
all while technology progressed at breakneck speeds

829
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:30,220
leaving both software and hardware behind

830
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:35,340
after only a few years. Within this chaos the video game industry

831
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:40,860
rose fell rose fell and then finally rose again

832
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:45,820
and each time there was a connection to the quality of the games.

833
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:49,500
First with the novelty of Pong before the industry got smothered in an

834
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,260
abundance of Pong clones then with the golden age of the arcade

835
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,380
and Atari's move to bring that golden age to consoles

836
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,780
before a massive low quality cheaply produced games once more sunk Atari

837
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:04,780
and much of the industry with them and then finally with Nintendo

838
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:08,380
bringing new life to the industry with their higher standard of quality

839
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:13,980
and groundbreaking flagship series. The evolution of the gaming industry

840
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,500
wasn't exactly smooth but by the end of the 80s

841
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:25,420
video games had come a long way. In 1972 there was Pong. In 1989

842
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:29,340
Prince of Persia on the Apple II used rotoscoping technology to reduce

843
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:34,140
smooth true-to-life animations. Shadow of the Beast on the Amiga combined

844
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,100
detailed sprite work with parallax scrolling

845
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,860
to create stunning backgrounds. Final fight on arcades

846
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,140
up the level of detail and the amount of things on screen at once

847
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:48,460
to seriously impressive levels and even on consoles

848
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:52,540
the new generation of 16-bit systems was starting to really show what those 16

849
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,660
bits could do with games like Golden Axe providing much

850
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:58,700
better visuals than was seen in the last generation

851
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:03,660
and it wasn't just graphics. On the NES developers experience with

852
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:07,020
designing games and their familiarity with the system

853
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:11,820
was also showing dividends. Take the opening of the famously difficult

854
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:19,580
action platformer Ninja Gaiden.

855
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:52,700
Sound, visuals and cinematic style are all combined masterfully here to create

856
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:57,020
some really compelling storytelling that draws players in and contextualizes

857
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:03,260
what you actually do in game and it does all this in less than a minute.

858
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,780
Meanwhile on PC games like the City Builder

859
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:12,620
SimCity or God Game Populous for once more treading new ground and creating

860
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:17,180
new genres that challenged how people thought about video games.

861
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:20,700
Still if you really want to see how far games have come

862
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:25,420
no single title illustrated it better than the latest entry in Nintendo's

863
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:28,860
most iconic series.

864
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:33,820
Widely considered one of the greatest games ever made

865
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:36,780
and as close to perfect as a sequel can be

866
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:41,100
Super Mario Bros 3 is the pinnacle of the NES library

867
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,460
and it still holds up all these years later.

868
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:48,060
Where some NES sequels went in bold new directions

869
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:52,620
not always with the best results the third game in the Super Mario series

870
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:55,820
instead takes everything which worked about the first title

871
01:19:55,820 --> 01:20:01,580
and does it bigger and better. From the new overworld to multiple new power-ups

872
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:05,420
new enemies larger levels enhanced visuals an expanded moveset

873
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:10,540
multiplayer and a much longer runtime it was a game which did quite a bit to

874
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:14,220
impress but what shined brightest of all was its

875
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:18,460
creative level design. Every world had its own theme

876
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:22,540
every stage felt distinct and new things were introduced constantly

877
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:26,460
with the player never quite sure what to expect next.

878
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,260
Somehow in just three years since the first game

879
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:33,980
the team behind Super Mario Bros 3 worked out how to make the perfect 2D

880
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:41,020
Mario game and then they did it. Games had come a long way

881
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:45,180
but in the grand scheme of things they were just getting started

882
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,860
and the next decade would bring even more progress

883
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:53,020
more change and more drama.

884
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:04,300
By the start of the 90s the gaming industry was well and truly established.

885
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,500
With the launch of the Game Boy Nintendo had cemented their status as the

886
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,940
market leader but the aging Nintendo entertainment system

887
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:15,420
was now facing tough competition from Sega's next generation Genesis

888
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:19,900
setting the stage for one of gaming's most legendary rivalries.

889
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,700
Meanwhile the increasing affordability of the personal computer

890
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,060
was making PC games a more serious part of the industry

891
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,900
while gaming itself was moving ever towards the mainstream

892
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:34,780
with bigger budgets bigger names and bigger controversies.

893
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:39,260
Overall though the 90s was a time of rapid technological progress.

894
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:43,980
A bit of a decade the 8-bit NES a third generation console

895
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,740
was the best selling on the market yet by the decades close

896
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:52,300
consoles were entering their sixth generation with 128 bits of computing

897
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:56,620
power inside much more advanced systems. Graphics

898
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,340
would transition from 2D sprites and pixel based

899
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,020
to the brave new three-dimensional world of polygons.

900
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,700
Cartridges were replaced by the much higher capacity CD-ROM.

901
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:11,260
Multiple new genres of games emerged including the most popular of all time.

902
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:15,100
Massive franchises were established including the most successful of all

903
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,780
time and game design experienced its own evolution

904
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:23,500
as developers raced to keep up with the continually changing times.

905
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Before all this however the decade began with action

906
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,700
and while the fighting between consoles might be what's most remembered

907
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:35,180
about the 90s arcades also had some important fighting of their own to do

908
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:41,260
first.

909
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:45,980
Arcade growth came to a stop following the crash of 1983

910
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:49,340
but arcades still made up a large part of the market afterwards

911
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,940
and they still continue to offer the definitive video game experience by way

912
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:58,380
of graphics and immersion for those who had the quarters to play.

913
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:02,620
By the start of the 16-bit era however their technological edge was narrowing

914
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:06,460
and even arcade heavyweight sega had started to move away from marketing

915
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,980
itself as the company that brought the arcade experience home

916
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:14,460
due to the perception of arcades losing relevance within the industry.

917
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,300
Most people probably expected the 90s to be the decade where arcade games

918
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,300
quietly disappeared and maybe that would have happened

919
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:33,740
if not for the arrival of one game that changed everything.

920
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:37,100
Street Fighter 2 wasn't technically the first fighting game

921
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:42,380
but you'd be forgiven for thinking it was. Reaching arcades in 1991 it

922
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:46,380
represented a massive evolution from Capcom's 1987 predecessor

923
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:49,660
and brought many of the staples people have come to expect from the genre

924
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:53,580
including combo mechanics, precise joystick controls

925
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:58,620
and a focus on face-to-face player versus player action.

926
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:01,900
Before Street Fighter 2 competitive video games were about

927
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,740
high scores and so the competition was indirect

928
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,340
but Street Fighter 2 allowed players to go head-to-head

929
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:14,460
making competition more active, exciting and genuine.

930
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:17,660
This was a major step for gaming and paved the way for the concept of death

931
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:21,100
matches as well as more serious competitive tournaments

932
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:26,460
and games as a form of esports. For arcades though fighting games was

933
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:31,340
simply a match made in heaven and they instantly brought new life to the scene.

934
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:34,860
The social nature of arcades was a perfect fit for a genre that was about

935
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:38,940
being the best and winning in style and the popularity of Street Fighter was

936
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:42,380
explosive causing a significant resurgence in arcades

937
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:45,500
before soon going on to be one of the highest selling console games of the

938
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:50,940
next generation and leaving an immediate impact on pop culture.

939
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,900
Street Fighter 2 was soon met with competition itself

940
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:58,780
first from SNK's Fatal Fury in late 91 then from Midway's

941
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:03,980
infamously violent Mortal Kombat in 92 before arcades once more cemented

942
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:06,620
themselves as the leaders of video game technology

943
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:11,260
with the cutting-edge 3D of Virtua Fighter from Sega in 93

944
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:15,820
and Namco's Tekken in 94 with a whole host of other smaller names

945
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,820
springing up along the way. For a time fighting games were the hottest

946
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:23,580
genre in gaming and they made a lot of money in the process

947
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:26,780
with Electronic Gaming Monthly reporting that in Japan

948
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:30,780
fighting games accounted for 80% of all gaming sales

949
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:35,420
in 1996. Other important advancements in arcades

950
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:40,220
came from the move to 3D technology which preceded the jump to 3D seen in the

951
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:44,300
next generation of consoles and was in large part the result of a rivalry

952
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:49,740
between Sega and Namco. This can be seen in Virtua Fighter and Tekken

953
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,020
as well as a number of notable racing and light gun games

954
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:59,500
including Virtua Racing, Daytona USA, Virtua Cop and House of the Dead from Sega

955
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:04,540
and Ridge Racer, Point Blank and Time Crisis from Namco.

956
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:07,980
Konami's highly original rhythm-based Dance Dance Revolution

957
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:13,900
in 1998 also proved highly influential. Still while arcades might have seen a

958
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,060
renaissance in the early and mid 90s this was ultimately only

959
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:21,740
enough to delay the inevitable and as the decade grew to a close

960
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:26,460
amidst a surging console market arcades once more entered into a period of

961
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:32,220
decline as the era of the arcade gradually came to an end.

962
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,300
Today arcades mostly exist as a nostalgic relic of the past

963
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:40,300
but their importance on gaming history was enormous.

964
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:44,460
For years arcades were the largest and most technologically advanced section of

965
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,980
the industry and in addition to producing many of gaming's greatest

966
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:52,620
titles they also left an enduring impact on gaming culture.

967
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:56,060
Still while arcades might have kicked off the decade's action

968
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:01,820
it would be consoles that would take the fighting to a whole other level.

969
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:08,620
Sega Shot First

970
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:12,380
In addition to beating Nintendo out the gates in entering the fourth generation

971
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:16,060
Sega was also responsible for making things personal by deliberately

972
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:21,100
targeting Nintendo in their marketing.

973
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,580
Conventional wisdom might suggest that naming and by extension giving publicity

974
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,020
to your main competitor in your own marketing

975
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:32,540
isn't the best strategy yet conventional wisdom

976
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:38,220
isn't always correct. Genesis does may be the most famous gaming commercial of

977
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:43,020
all time and it exemplified the spirit of the fourth generation.

978
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,620
Taking shots at Nintendo wasn't the only part of Sega of America's grand

979
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:49,180
strategy however they also sought to create a

980
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:52,860
strong library of unique games which would appeal to western audiences

981
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:57,740
and help make the Genesis stand out. Early examples of this can be seen with

982
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,660
Michael Jackson's Moonwalker and several celebrity-induced sports games

983
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,420
like Joe Montana Football or Pat Riley Basketball.

984
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:09,020
These still didn't provide Sega with a true system salary needed though

985
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:13,180
and to make matters worse their head start only lasted so long

986
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:18,380
as in November of 1990 Nintendo's much anticipated 16-bit system finally

987
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:23,020
launched in Japan alongside the latest entry of one of gaming's now most

988
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:27,340
iconic series Super Mario World. In a head-to-head

989
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,540
comparison there wasn't a lot to differentiate the two competing pieces

990
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,740
of hardware. The Genesis did have an advantage in

991
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:37,500
pure CPU power but the Super Nintendo boasted more RAM,

992
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:43,020
better sound quality, more on-screen colors and more detailed sprites.

993
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:47,180
The systems were also similarly priced meaning it was games that would be the

994
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:51,420
ultimate deciding factor and it was here that Sega was about

995
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:56,940
to make their most important play yet. Mario had launched Nintendo into the

996
01:28:56,940 --> 01:29:01,100
home console market and was seen as central to Nintendo's success

997
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:05,580
so Sega decided they needed their own Mario.

998
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:09,260
Work on the character design started all the way back in 1988

999
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:13,580
and went through multiple revisions with Sega Japan and Sega America working

1000
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:17,580
together and often disagreeing over the direction.

1001
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:20,780
Central to the design was the decision to emphasize speed

1002
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:25,260
and to appeal to Western audiences with designer Naoto Oshima

1003
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,380
even going to New York to ask locals in Central Park their opinion on the design

1004
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:34,060
which ultimately led to a blue hedgehog by the name

1005
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:38,540
of Sonic. The emphasis on speed carried over to game design

1006
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:42,380
with the team wanting Sonic's default speed to be equal to Mario's running

1007
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:45,980
speed and for his running speed to be a great deal

1008
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:49,820
faster. This led to many animation and frame rate

1009
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:52,300
problems but the team stuck with the idea

1010
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:57,100
not wanting to compromise their desire for players to go fast.

1011
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,860
Levels were then designed to be large and non-linear to take advantage of the

1012
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:04,700
main character's enhanced movement while also once again being seen as a

1013
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,540
straight upgrade to the levels seen in Mario.

1014
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:12,380
Finally vibrant colors and a laid-back soundtrack were used to give the game a

1015
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:16,220
strong sense of identity and in summer 1991

1016
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:19,660
the project was complete with Sonic the Hedgehog

1017
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:23,500
releasing worldwide about two months before the North American release of

1018
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:30,300
the Super Nintendo and so at long last Sega had their killer app.

1019
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,820
Gotta go. Hey guy you're the first serious gamer I've seen all morning check

1020
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:38,060
this out brand new 16-bit Super Nintendo in Super Mario World!

1021
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:43,020
Wow! What's this one? Oh this is a Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega Genesis.

1022
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,940
Look at these radical colors huh? Wow Sonic's fast too.

1023
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:50,620
Over here! I like Genesis and it costs a lot less.

1024
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:54,620
Look here! I'll take Sonic and Genesis.

1025
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:58,300
Sonic was an immediate success and with it the Genesis outsold the Super

1026
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:02,860
Nintendo 2 to 1 in the 1991 US holiday season

1027
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:07,980
with Sega taking a 65% share of the 16-bit market.

1028
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:11,500
Meanwhile in Europe Sega performed even better as the Super Nintendo

1029
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:15,980
wouldn't see an EU release until mid 1992.

1030
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:19,660
This was one of the major differences between Nintendo and Sega at the time

1031
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:23,340
as while Sega were pioneering the idea of a global release for systems

1032
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:27,020
and software Nintendo were by contrast much slower

1033
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,860
at bringing their products to other markets. In the end

1034
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:34,540
this paid off for Sega and allowed them to take a clear lead over their rival

1035
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:38,940
for the very first time and this wasn't the only advantage

1036
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:43,340
Sega now had. Their greatest weakness in the last generation

1037
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:46,860
third-party support would no longer be a problem after Sega

1038
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:50,380
entered the market early and offered publishers much more favorable license

1039
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:54,300
in terms than Nintendo. They also worked hard to stay on top of

1040
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:59,340
hardware developments releasing the Sega CD or Mega CD in 1992

1041
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:04,140
as an add-on for the Genesis. The Sega CD wasn't cheap and its sales

1042
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:07,660
numbers were relatively modest but it did offer a more high-end

1043
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:11,340
product to those who wanted it and the new CD technology provided much

1044
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:14,780
greater storage capacity allowing for more detailed audio

1045
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:19,900
and entirely new types of games like Bose focused on full motion video.

1046
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:24,700
Lastly Sega also didn't slow down with their aggressive marketing.

1047
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:28,220
The Sega Genesis has blast processing. Super Nintendo

1048
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:32,460
doesn't. So what's blast processing do?

1049
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:47,100
And uh what if you don't have blast processing?

1050
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:58,540
It is debatable whether blast processing is even real

1051
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:02,940
but one thing everyone can agree on is that the Super Nintendo

1052
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,740
doesn't have it. I mean sure technically the Super Nintendo was the more

1053
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:11,820
advanced system but technically the Genesis did have

1054
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:17,180
faster processing so Sega made sure that's what they focused on

1055
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:21,980
and it worked. Still even if Nintendo didn't have blast

1056
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:25,020
processing there was something they did have

1057
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:32,700
which some might even say is more important. Games. The Legend of Zelda

1058
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:36,300
a link to the past released in America in 1992

1059
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:40,620
and did for Zelda what Super Mario Bros 3 did for Mario.

1060
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:45,020
As a near perfect sequel and one of the best games of the 16-bit era

1061
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:49,340
a link to the past expanded the overworld, expanded links moveset,

1062
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:52,860
expanded the dungeon design and then added an entire

1063
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:56,460
parallel dark world for the player to travel between that was similar and

1064
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,500
yet completely different to the world they knew.

1065
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,260
The result was a landmark action adventure game that set a standard for

1066
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:10,140
2D Zelda still not surpassed to this day and Nintendo didn't stop there.

1067
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:14,300
Sequels were expected but Nintendo had new ideas too

1068
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:18,220
and they still had one of the best people around for the job.

1069
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:22,300
Shigeru Miyamoto worked on several of the Super Nintendo's early first party

1070
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:26,140
titles including the new futuristic racing game F-Zero

1071
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:29,900
and the technologically groundbreaking rail shooter Star Fox,

1072
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,780
the first Nintendo game to feature polygonal graphics

1073
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:37,820
through the use of an additional graphics chip included in the game's cartridge.

1074
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:42,380
Released in early 93 Star Fox went on to become one of the console's best-selling

1075
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,100
games although it was still surpassed by another new

1076
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:50,300
Nintendo franchise, 1992's Super Mario Kart which

1077
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,820
brought Mario and friends into the world of kart racing

1078
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:57,660
kicking off their own subgenre in the process.

1079
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:01,740
Still Nintendo weren't the only one making good games.

1080
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:05,260
Sega may have courted many third-party publishers but some of the most

1081
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:10,700
important stayed loyal to Nintendo and brought a number of impressive sequels with them.

1082
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:14,140
Square released Final Fantasy 4 known then as 2

1083
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:19,020
outside Japan, Enix released Dragon Quest V which sold millions of copies

1084
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:23,820
even as a Japan-only title, Konami released Super Castlevania 4

1085
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:26,940
allowing players to once more take the fight to Dracula

1086
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:32,540
but most important of all was Capcom who were at the time holding the rights to

1087
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:36,300
the hottest game in the world, Street Fighter 2.

1088
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,660
And while this game would eventually find its way to both systems

1089
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:43,580
it still came to the Super NES first giving Nintendo

1090
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:47,660
a head start of more than a year on what would go on to be the best-selling

1091
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:53,020
third-party title of the generation and with Street Fighter

1092
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:59,420
Nintendo had the edge they needed. Holiday season 1992 and this time Nintendo

1093
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,620
was selling more systems allowing them to climb back into first

1094
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:07,660
place in 93. Sega weren't done yet though and the

1095
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:12,860
battle was about to get even messier. Wasting no time after the success of

1096
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:17,020
their new best-selling game of all time Sega released the sequel to Sonic in late

1097
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:20,940
92 featuring even faster gameplay alongside

1098
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:26,700
reoccurring series Sidekick Tales but it was their more adult titles that

1099
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:32,700
would truly define the next year. Two major features of this era of console

1100
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:36,940
warfare were the idea that Sega had the more mature system and games

1101
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:41,740
than the family-friendly Nintendo and debates over which version of specific

1102
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:45,900
games were better. These days exclusives are what people

1103
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:49,340
most remember but plenty of titles came to both systems

1104
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:53,340
sometimes with completely different variants kicking off endless arguments

1105
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:57,340
between fans over which system had the superior version

1106
01:36:57,340 --> 01:37:01,500
Contra 3 Alien Wars vs Contra Hardcore

1107
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:05,100
Super Castlevania vs Castlevania Bloodlines

1108
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:10,060
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in Time vs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1109
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:16,060
The Hyperstone Heist and on it went. Sometimes two competing titles would be

1110
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:19,100
pretty much identical but there were other times when there were big

1111
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:24,860
differences and clear winners and losers. For example with Street Fighter 2

1112
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:29,100
the Super Nintendo was king with not only a year head start but also a more

1113
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:33,500
suitable controller that had four face buttons alongside two shoulder buttons

1114
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:37,900
compared to just three face buttons on the original Genesis controller.

1115
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:42,780
Other times though the Genesis reigned supreme like with 1993's Aladdin

1116
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:46,380
where the Genesis version was aided by real Disney animators

1117
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:50,540
and went on to be one of the system's best-selling games.

1118
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:55,020
And then there was Mortal Kombat a game which combined

1119
01:37:55,020 --> 01:38:00,060
arguments over Sega's more adult nature and arguments over which system had the

1120
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:04,540
superior version and ended with Sega and Nintendo

1121
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,220
sitting in front of a US congressional hearing on the dangers

1122
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:10,780
of violence in video games.

1123
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:17,100
Violence and violent images permeate more and more aspects of our lives

1124
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:21,420
and I think it's time to draw the line. I know that one place

1125
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:27,580
parents want us to draw the line is with violence in video games. The fact is that

1126
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:32,300
a new generation of video games crosses that line containing the most

1127
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,220
horrible depictions of graphic violence and sex

1128
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:39,180
including particularly violence against women.

1129
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:44,220
You see much like Street Fighter before it Mortal Kombat was a big success

1130
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:49,420
but its graphic depictions of violence and brutal post-victory fatalities

1131
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:54,140
attracted more attention than from just players kicking off a media frenzy

1132
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:58,860
and national conversation on the role of violence in video games.

1133
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:02,220
When Mortal Kombat made its way from arcades to consoles

1134
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:06,060
Nintendo opted to tone down the violence by removing the blood effects

1135
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:09,980
but Sega instead left them in as an unlockable option

1136
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:13,420
making the Genesis version the most desirable.

1137
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:16,060
Knowing that controversy might be on its way

1138
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:20,220
Sega created their own internal rating system ahead of Mortal Kombat's console

1139
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,180
release but this didn't prove to be enough

1140
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:27,820
and by the end of 1993 the national conversation on video game violence

1141
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:31,980
had reached US Congress with both Sega and Nintendo

1142
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:35,420
being called up to answer some difficult questions.

1143
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:38,780
A number of advocacy groups and senators spoke on the issue

1144
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:42,860
presenting a united front while focusing heavily on Mortal Kombat

1145
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:46,780
and the strange Sega CD-FMB game Night Trap

1146
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:50,300
and claiming that there had been a systemic failure of the gaming industry

1147
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:55,500
to police itself. When it came to those speaking in favor of the gaming industry

1148
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,260
however those present were anything but united

1149
01:39:59,260 --> 01:40:01,980
with Nintendo getting the chance to speak first

1150
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:07,740
and wasting no time in putting the blame squarely on Sega's lack of internal policy.

1151
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:12,700
In the past years some very violent and offensive games have reached the market

1152
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,300
and of course I'm speaking about Mortal Kombat and Night Trap

1153
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:21,260
and let me say that for the record I want to state that Night Trap will never

1154
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:26,700
appear on a Nintendo system. Obviously it would not pass our guidelines.

1155
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:32,940
This game which as you've indicated promotes violence against women

1156
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:37,420
simply has no place in our society. Meanwhile Sega began by defending

1157
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:41,260
itself in the way that Sega fans at the time defended their favorite gaming

1158
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:46,140
system on school playgrounds i.e. by reminding those in attendance

1159
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:50,700
that the Genesis unlike its competition wasn't made for kids.

1160
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:54,620
In recent days the glare of the media spotlight on this issue

1161
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:59,900
has resulted in the circulation of a number of distorted and inaccurate claims.

1162
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:02,860
The most damaging of these distortions in my view

1163
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:07,900
is the notion that Sega are only in the business of selling games to children.

1164
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:12,220
This is not the case. Sega also highlighted their new rating system

1165
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:16,380
but this received a lot of pushback including from Nintendo's representative

1166
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,500
who seemed much more interested in attacking Sega

1167
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,340
than defending the gaming industry. Let me make it just a couple of other

1168
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:27,420
points. I can't sit here and allow you to be told

1169
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:31,980
that somehow the video game business has been transformed today

1170
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:36,860
from children to adults. It hasn't been and Mr. White who is a former Nintendo

1171
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:39,900
employee knows the demographics as well as I do.

1172
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:44,620
Furthermore I can't let you sit here and by this nonsense that this

1173
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:49,900
Sega Night Trap game was somehow only meant for adults. The fact of the

1174
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:53,420
matter is this is a copy of the packaging.

1175
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:57,660
There was no rating on this game at all when the game was introduced.

1176
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:01,900
Small children bought this at Toys R Us and he knows that as well as I do.

1177
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:05,660
Ultimately the senators seemed unimpressed by gaming's great console war

1178
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:09,660
and decided to treat Sega and Nintendo in much the same way that a teacher

1179
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:14,700
might treat two squabbling children. By giving them both a slap on the wrist

1180
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:19,180
and telling them they better start working together to make things right.

1181
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:23,420
So gaming's fiercest rivals came together with other representatives from

1182
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:26,540
the industry to create the Interactive Digital

1183
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,900
Software Association which soon led to the creation of the

1184
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:35,900
Entertainment Software Rating Board or ESRB who would produce a unified set of

1185
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:39,820
age ratings for all commercial video games that retailers would then opt into

1186
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,380
enforcing. Something that has since become common

1187
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:46,140
practice across many different regions.

1188
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:49,500
In the congressional hearing Sega came under the heaviest attack

1189
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:53,020
and following public outcry many retailers pulled the controversial

1190
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:58,140
night trap from their shelves. However when it came to actual video game

1191
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:02,460
players this didn't seem to damage Sega's reputation at all

1192
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:08,700
and instead helped cement their status as the cooler more mature gaming company

1193
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:15,740
ultimately leading to sales going up. Holiday season 1993 and Sega came out

1194
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:22,220
on top retaking the overall lead in 94 with 55 percent of the market.

1195
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:27,020
By 1994 Sega and Nintendo weren't the only ones dealing with controversy

1196
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:30,220
though as in the world of the personal computer

1197
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:33,740
another violent video game was exploding in popularity

1198
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:38,460
and leaving its own mark on gaming history.

1199
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:45,980
In the early 90s consoles might have received the most attention

1200
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:49,420
and made the most money but PC was still the place to be

1201
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:53,420
the innovation and it saw a number of big releases of its own.

1202
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:57,660
LucasArts 1990 pirate themed The Secret of Monkey Island

1203
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:01,180
set a new standard for the graphical adventure genre with its user-friendly

1204
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:05,740
interface sharp comedic writing and a more open game design but removed any

1205
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:09,500
sort of fail state and ensured players could never be locked out of puzzles or

1206
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:13,900
the means to progress the game. In 1991 Sidmir's

1207
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:17,980
civilization popularized the 4x genre of strategy games

1208
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:23,340
where you explored expanded exploited and exterminated your opposition

1209
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:27,500
while guiding a human civilization over the course of several millennia

1210
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,700
a concept that proved as expansive and original

1211
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:35,340
as it was addictive. Delphine software's strikingly cinematic

1212
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:38,540
action adventure game Another World also released that year

1213
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:41,740
leaving a lasting impression on many who played it.

1214
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:45,500
Featuring a scientist fighting for survival on an alien planet

1215
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,940
it placed a heavy emphasis on presentation and told its story

1216
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:53,100
entirely without dialogue creating a game that felt years ahead of its time

1217
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:56,300
and would influence a number of important future titles including

1218
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:03,020
Ico, Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill. In 1992 Westwood Studios created the

1219
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:07,740
first real-time strategy game with Dune 2 combining resource gathering

1220
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:12,780
base building and small-scale warfare into an addictive new formula.

1221
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:16,700
Dune 2 would be followed by Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft Orcs and

1222
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:20,380
Humans in 1994 and Westwood's Alternative History

1223
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:25,180
Command and Conquer in 1995 which together established the RTS as an

1224
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:29,980
important genre within gaming. 92 also saw the birth of the survival

1225
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:33,580
horror genre with infograms alone in the dark.

1226
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:36,780
A game that went beyond embracing horror as an aesthetic

1227
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:39,980
by deliberately disempowering the player to heighten the tension

1228
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:44,860
and create a sense of dread. Its haunted mansion setting and cinematic

1229
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:49,740
camera would also greatly influence future titles of the genre.

1230
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:53,900
Meanwhile in the world of role-playing games the Ultima series continued strongly

1231
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:57,740
with its highly acclaimed seventh entry The Black Gate

1232
01:45:57,740 --> 01:46:01,260
but it was a spin-off from the main series that proved to be the most

1233
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:06,300
innovative RPG that year. Looking Glass Studios Ultima Underworld

1234
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:10,060
was the first role-playing game to feature first-person action in a 3D

1235
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:14,060
environment. Described as a dungeon simulation by its

1236
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:16,780
creators, Ultima Underworld combined the dungeon

1237
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:20,540
crawling of genre grandfathers like Wizardry with cutting-edge action

1238
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:24,540
gameplay and environmental design to create a brand new type of action

1239
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:28,780
RPG that would pave the way for the immersive sim genre and many future

1240
01:46:28,780 --> 01:46:33,180
titles. 1993 also saw the release of the visually

1241
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:36,780
stunning graphic adventure game Mist from Cyan Inc.

1242
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:40,620
which took full advantage of the vastly expanded storage capacity

1243
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:46,300
of Benoo CD-ROM to create its iconic picturesque 3D island while helping to

1244
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:50,860
popularize the adoption of CD drivers in the process.

1245
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:55,900
Mist's puzzle-solving gameplay was quite slow but its graphics were far beyond

1246
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:59,580
anything else at the time leading it to become one of the best-selling PC

1247
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:05,740
games of all time. Finally in 1994, Mythos Games sci-fi

1248
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:09,820
strategy game XCOM UFO Defense combined turn-based tactical

1249
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:13,740
battles with real-time management to create a surprisingly deep

1250
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:17,900
earth defense simulation unlike any other game before it.

1251
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:21,500
While Origin System's ambitious latest entry into the Space Combat

1252
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:25,580
Wing Commander series included extensive live action FMV cutscenes

1253
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:29,820
that featured big Hollywood names like Mark Hamill and Malcolm McDowell

1254
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:34,220
represent in a major step of PC gaming towards the mainstream.

1255
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:38,220
Still as important as each of these games were none of them are what the early

1256
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:42,540
90s are best remembered for. For that we need to go back to the start

1257
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:45,260
of the decade where a small group of 20-something year old

1258
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:49,500
developers were working for software company Softisk in an office

1259
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,420
in Shreveport, Louisiana. It was here that 20-year-old

1260
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:57,340
university dropout John Carmack was thinking about a well-known problem

1261
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:02,060
in PC game development. How to achieve side-scrolling graphics

1262
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:06,300
on a computer. You see while computers were powerful

1263
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:09,500
in certain ways they weren't designed specifically for gaming

1264
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,780
meaning there were some things consoles were just better at

1265
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:18,300
like allowing for faster refresh rates. This meant PC struggled to redraw an

1266
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:22,780
entire screen at the same speed as a console making the iconic side-scrolling

1267
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:25,420
seen in so many of the most popular video games

1268
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:32,460
impossible until Carmack had an idea why redraw everything on screen

1269
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:37,260
when you could instead only redraw the parts that actually change.

1270
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:41,340
This became known as adaptive tile refresh and with it

1271
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:45,900
Carmack was about to change the world of PC gaming.

1272
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:49,260
First Carmack and friends recreated Super Mario Bros 3

1273
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:52,460
step by step something people thought couldn't be done

1274
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:56,140
on PC. They then sent the end result to Nintendo

1275
01:48:56,140 --> 01:49:00,380
who were admittedly impressed but told them they didn't want Nintendo games

1276
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:04,620
on anything except Nintendo hardware meaning all their hard work

1277
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:09,900
had been for nothing. So next they decided to make their own

1278
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,740
game instead. With no corporate backing or funding

1279
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:17,180
they decided to team up with shareware distributor Apogee Software

1280
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:21,580
to create the side-scrolling platformer Commander Keen.

1281
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:25,740
It was completed in just a few months and saw great success through the shareware

1282
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:29,260
model. Then once the first royalty check arrived

1283
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:33,420
John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack and Tom Hall

1284
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:37,500
decided to quit their jobs at Softisk to found their own company

1285
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:41,500
id Software. Carmack soon turned his attention to

1286
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:45,740
gaming's new frontier 3D and once more encountered a similar

1287
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:48,700
problem to before which was that computers of the time

1288
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:53,660
were just too slow to allow for fast action in 3D environments.

1289
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:57,020
id Software continued to create more shareware distributor games

1290
01:49:57,020 --> 01:50:01,580
while experimenting with 3D which allowed Carmack to iterate on his new 3D

1291
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:04,780
engine by restricting the viewpoint to increase speed

1292
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:09,260
using sprites and texture mapping to save space and so on.

1293
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:15,660
The end result was Wolfenstein 3D which released in summer 1992 and allowed

1294
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:18,860
players to mow down hordes of Nazis from a first person

1295
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:24,620
perspective in 3D environments. Wolfenstein was the first true first

1296
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:28,460
person shooter and its fast pace and smooth action

1297
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:32,380
made it hugely successful but it would soon be overshadowed

1298
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:36,780
by an even more impressive game.

1299
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:45,100
Released in late 1993 Doom was a game which changed gaming.

1300
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:49,340
Bigger, faster and more violent than Wolfenstein with visuals that looked years

1301
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:53,500
ahead of its predecessor Doom was an instant classic.

1302
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:58,300
For years there was no FPS genre there were only Doom clones.

1303
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:01,580
It invented the deathmatch while helping to pioneer the concept of networked

1304
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:04,300
multiplayer. It spawned one of the most active mod

1305
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:07,980
scenes of all time while greatly popularizing the concept of modding

1306
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:13,100
and it was estimated that by late 1995 it was installed on more computers

1307
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:18,140
worldwide than Microsoft's latest Windows operating system.

1308
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:22,300
Doom was a gaming phenomenon and it only achieved that level of success

1309
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:26,780
because underneath its demon-infested exterior and innovative technology

1310
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:31,180
was a really well made game that used fast action

1311
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:34,780
varied enemy encounters and complex level design full of secrets

1312
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:39,100
to create a formula that still holds up all these years later.

1313
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:42,940
Doom also served as a perfect representation of what made PC gaming

1314
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:47,820
so different to consoles in the early 90s. While Sega was desperately trying to

1315
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:51,020
market itself as the mature alternative to Nintendo

1316
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:54,540
games like Doom were providing a genuine mature alternative

1317
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:59,020
without even really meaning to and while consoles were embroiled in a clash

1318
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:02,940
of corporate giants and spending tens of millions on marketing every year

1319
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:06,380
Doom was self-published, distributed through shareware

1320
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:10,620
and made by initially just five guys with two more coming on to help near the

1321
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:14,380
end. And despite this humble background

1322
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:19,020
it was still the most impressive 3d game the industry had ever seen

1323
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:22,940
and it helped to create the most successful genre in gaming.

1324
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:26,380
There have been independent games that have been phenomenally successful since

1325
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:29,900
Doom but it is truly rare for an independent game

1326
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:33,340
to be so successful while also being technologically

1327
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:37,260
years ahead of its competition. The shareware distribution model can

1328
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:40,940
also be seen as a forerunner to digital distribution.

1329
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:44,860
It worked by offering part of the game as a free trial that anyone could download

1330
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:49,100
and play and then asking players to pay to purchase the rest.

1331
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:53,740
With no retailer or possibly publisher it meant games sold this way had much more

1332
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:56,620
limited reach but the lack of any middlemen also

1333
01:52:56,620 --> 01:53:01,900
meant lower prices for consumers and a larger cut of revenue for the developer.

1334
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:05,820
And so it should come as no surprise then but Doom's success

1335
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:09,420
quickly turned its creators into multi-millionaires.

1336
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:12,860
Six months after Doom's release John Carmack owned two

1337
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:17,500
Ferraris. He was 23 years old at the time.

1338
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:21,260
Its software would follow Doom with a sequel in 1994

1339
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:25,180
before creating an even more powerful engine to reduce their fully 3d Doom

1340
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:29,900
successor Quake in 1996 which took multiplayer to

1341
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:33,900
soaring new heights with far more modes and built in 16 player

1342
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:38,540
online capability. Quake was another big hit and with it

1343
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:42,700
the era of online first-person shooter domination had arrived.

1344
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:47,100
But for consoles the mid 90s would also bring the next generation of systems

1345
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:52,780
and it didn't exactly play out as most people expected.

1346
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:02,460
1994 was a big year for the gaming industry but its start was still dominated

1347
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:06,380
by the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo and the fallout from the

1348
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:11,020
violent video game debate. Sega had now edged back into the lead

1349
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:14,860
and this period would see several of the Genesis best exclusive titles

1350
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:17,740
such as the beat em up classic Streets of Rage 2,

1351
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:20,620
the side-scrolling platformer Rocket Knight Adventure

1352
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:24,940
and the action-packed running and gunning Gunstar Heroes.

1353
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:29,420
1994 would also see the release of not one but two new entries into Sega's

1354
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:33,420
hottest series after Sonic 3 became so large during development

1355
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:37,100
that it could no longer fit into a single cartridge causing it to be split

1356
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:41,660
into Sonic 3 and the separate Sonic and Knuckles.

1357
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:47,740
Nintendo had plenty of games of their own however. 1993's Super Mario All-Stars

1358
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:52,860
remade the first three entries into the Super Mario Bros series with Super Nintendo level graphics

1359
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:56,460
and is noticeable as not only one of the system's best-selling titles

1360
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:00,460
but also one of the first examples of a massively successful video game remake.

1361
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:06,540
In 1994 Nintendo would raise one of the Super Nintendo's most highly acclaimed titles with

1362
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:10,140
Super Metroid which upgraded the formula of the original game

1363
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:13,980
while retaining its rich sci-fi atmosphere and focus on exploration.

1364
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:19,340
Still, Nintendo's biggest game that year came at the hands of another developer.

1365
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:24,460
Due to concerns about falling behind Sega, Nintendo began looking for other studios

1366
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:28,620
to bring on board, leading them to approach the UK-based Studio Rare

1367
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:31,980
who had impressed them with their latest 3D model rendering technology.

1368
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:37,020
Nintendo suggested they use these pre-rendered graphics to make a platformer

1369
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:40,860
and gave them permission to use one of their oldest IPs to do it.

1370
01:55:41,180 --> 01:56:10,140
Even before Donkey Kong Country released in late 1994,

1371
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:12,940
its unique visual style brought it a lot of attention

1372
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:16,540
and convinced Nintendo to heavily back it with a generous marketing campaign.

1373
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:23,180
Even so, the game still exceeded expectations, setting the record for the fastest-selling game

1374
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:26,940
of all time and going on to become the third best-selling game on the system.

1375
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:33,420
It also wowed critics, impressing with its creative level design and timeless soundtrack

1376
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,100
in addition to the striking visuals.

1377
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:40,460
Donkey Kong Country was the edge Nintendo needed to pull back into the lead

1378
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:45,660
following a strong holiday season in 1994, but while high-quality new titles

1379
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:48,380
ensured the Super Nintendo was still going strong,

1380
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:52,460
by this point Sega was starting to turn their attention to future systems.

1381
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:57,340
The fifth console generation started early and saw heavy competition.

1382
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:03,580
The 3DO released in America in late 1993 and boasted some seriously impressive technical

1383
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:08,620
specifications, becoming the first system to fully take advantage of new CD-ROM technology.

1384
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:17,980
It also launched with a retail price of $700, which is $1,400 after inflation and struggled

1385
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:23,020
to build a library of solid exclusives, meaning it ultimately struggled to compete with later,

1386
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:25,660
better-known systems despite its strong launch.

1387
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:32,940
And as for those later systems, two would go head-to-head in Japan in late 1994,

1388
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:36,540
but this time, Nintendo wouldn't be one of them.

1389
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:42,220
Sega began work on the next system early after realizing the importance of CD-ROMs

1390
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:45,420
and having had promising results with 3D technology in arcades.

1391
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:51,260
At the same time as this, they tried to maintain support for the Genesis by creating a second add-on

1392
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:57,500
in addition to the Sega CD called the 32X that would bridge the gap between the two generations

1393
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:00,300
and offer a cheaper entry into the 32-bit era.

1394
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:06,380
Unfortunately, Sega struggled to produce enough games for either the Sega CD or the 32X to

1395
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:11,660
really justify their high costs, meaning both pieces of hardware ended up as commercial failures

1396
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:16,140
and might have damaged Sega's reputation with fans who did buy these add-ons due to their

1397
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:22,140
perceived lack of support. Still, it was the next generation where the battle would truly be decided

1398
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:27,260
and so Sega went all out on developing a new system that could meet their lofty expectations.

1399
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:32,220
While Sega was working on a 32-bit system of their own, however, a new entrant into the

1400
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:37,500
video game scene was doing the same and getting ready to change the console landscape forever more.

1401
01:58:38,780 --> 01:58:43,580
Sony was an electronics company founded after World War II and best known for their music

1402
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:49,900
products like the Sony Walkman. Their first foray into gaming hadn't turned out very well.

1403
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:55,340
A joint venture with Nintendo led to them producing the sound chip used in the Super Nintendo,

1404
01:58:55,660 --> 01:59:02,140
but they also worked with Nintendo on a CD-ROM add-on for the system. Before it could be completed,

1405
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:07,580
however, Nintendo got cold feet over how much control the terms of the deal gave Sony and instead

1406
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:14,300
went to negotiate a more favorable deal with Sony's main rival, Philips. Not knowing this,

1407
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:19,980
Sony went on to announce their Super Nintendo add-on at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1991.

1408
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:26,860
It was called the PlayStation, and the very next day, Nintendo got up on stage themselves

1409
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:32,540
and announced their new partnership with Philips, declaring the PlayStation dead in the process.

1410
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:38,860
For Sony, this was a serious blow and an even more serious betrayal,

1411
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:42,300
something not taken lightly in Japan's honor-based business culture.

1412
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:47,820
They responded by severing all ties with Nintendo, with many executives at Sony wanting

1413
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:52,140
to end all activity connected to the gaming industry, which they had come to view as too

1414
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:57,180
close to the toy industry to fit with Sony's established brand, in addition to being apparently

1415
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:03,180
highly unreliable. Ken Kutaragi, the man in charge of the PlayStation's development,

1416
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:09,340
wanted the opposite, however. Kutaragi was confident in his technology and proposed Sony

1417
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:14,060
go it alone and create a standalone console, while using the company's poor treatment from

1418
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:17,820
Nintendo to support his argument for why they shouldn't give up on the idea.

1419
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:25,980
In the end, Kutaragi got his way, but he still had a problem. Not only was developing their own

1420
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:31,020
system considerably risky, but Sony also had no actual experience in game development.

1421
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:37,020
In the past, consoles had lived and died on the strength of their first party support,

1422
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:42,940
which for Sony didn't even exist. So, not knowing anything about game development,

1423
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:47,420
the team decided to stick with what they did know, hardware and business.

1424
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:53,660
To this end, they designed the system from the ground up with a focus on 3D polygon graphics

1425
02:00:53,660 --> 02:00:57,100
and also set out to secure their desperately needed third party support.

1426
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:02,540
To do this, they formed partnerships with established Japanese developers like Namco and

1427
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:08,140
Konami, while purchasing the UK-based Cygnosis, who were best known for their widely popular puzzle

1428
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:15,180
game Lemmings. This gave Sony their first in-house team, and it was through this that they would

1429
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:21,100
stumble into their big break. Developers at Cygnosis found the current workstation-based

1430
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:26,460
development kits to be overly expensive and impractical, and so they persuaded Sony to

1431
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:31,740
instead use a PC-based development system, thus marking a major turning point for the

1432
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:35,420
console industry, which had largely ignored PCs until then.

1433
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:42,300
PC-based development was not only cheaper and more efficient, it also streamlined the process

1434
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:48,300
for third parties, while making porting games between PC and Sony's new system much easier

1435
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:54,140
than before, something which proved crucial in allowing Sony to compete with their more established

1436
02:01:54,140 --> 02:02:00,060
rivals. As the console neared completion, Sony decided to break from the tradition of using

1437
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:04,460
the company's name in the title of the system due to upper management's fear that failure could

1438
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:11,980
damage the company's brand, and so the console would keep its original name. And in December 1994,

1439
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:17,580
the PlayStation launched in Japan, just one week after release of another new console,

1440
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:19,100
the Sega Saturn.

1441
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:48,140
The two systems were similarly priced,

1442
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:52,700
and offered similar performance, but it was Sega who proved to be the early favorite,

1443
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:57,500
thanks in large part to the hugely popular Virtua Fighter, which sold at a near one-to-one

1444
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:03,820
ratio with the Saturn at release. For the PlayStation, it was Sega's big arcade rival Namco

1445
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:08,380
that would be the console's most important developer in its first year, with Ridge Racer

1446
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:13,020
proving the most successful launch title and Tekken soon following to give the PlayStation

1447
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:19,260
a 3D fighting game of its own. Still, exclusives wouldn't be the most important factor in the

1448
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:25,900
new system's first years. As both systems prepared for their global release, both companies came up

1449
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:31,180
with a plan to give them the edge over the other, which they would reveal at the first-ever Electronic

1450
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:38,220
Entertainment Expo in 1995, where 40,000 eager attendees packed the Los Angeles Convention Center

1451
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:44,540
to get a glimpse of the next generation of gaming. Sega went first and took to the stage

1452
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:51,100
to announce that, due to high consumer demand, the Saturn would release immediately, that very day,

1453
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:56,700
at select retailers. This was four months before the expected September release date,

1454
02:03:56,700 --> 02:04:02,540
and Sega hoped this headstart would give them the advantage. Unfortunately for them, however,

1455
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:07,100
other retailers responded to this surprise announcement very negatively, with KB toys

1456
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:12,460
even dropping Sega from its lineup, and the early release also left the Saturn's launch lineup

1457
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:19,020
rather light on games. Things quickly went from bad to worse, though, because Sony followed with

1458
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:24,780
a surprise announcement of their own, which came when SCE President of America, Steve Race, took

1459
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:28,940
to the stage to give one of gaming's all-time greatest speeches.

1460
02:04:55,100 --> 02:05:06,540
$299 was $100 less than the Saturn, meaning the systems were no longer similarly priced,

1461
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:11,820
and it turned out that while Sega's gamble backfired, Sony's instead paid off.

1462
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:19,500
The PlayStation released on the 9th of September 1995. Two days later, it had sold more units than

1463
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:25,420
the Saturn had in the last four months. The PlayStation's launch was huge, and what's more,

1464
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:30,380
their easier-to-develop for system was about to start proving its worth, as a number of former

1465
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:37,180
PC developers soon started releasing games for Sony's new console. Notable examples include

1466
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:43,660
Platformer Rayman from Ubisoft in 95, Naughty Dog's soon-to-be-iconic Crash Bandicoot in 96,

1467
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:48,380
which gave the PlayStation its first real mascot, and Tomb Raider from Core Design,

1468
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:52,940
a graphically impressive action-adventure game featuring one of gaming's most recognisable

1469
02:05:52,940 --> 02:06:00,060
female leads. 96 also saw the release of another landmark PlayStation title from Capcom with

1470
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:05,020
Resident Evil, which may be the single most influential survival horror game of all time.

1471
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:10,460
All of these titles were big commercial hits, with Resident Evil, Crash Bandicoot,

1472
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:13,980
and Tomb Raider each going on to sell over 5 million copies.

1473
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:20,300
The Saturn did have games of its own, with several high-quality arcade ports, alongside some strong

1474
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:27,100
new first-party titles like Night's Into Dreams and Panzer Jagoons. Sony, however, increasingly

1475
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:32,300
seemed to have the rest of the gaming industry on their side, and in time, Sony's initial victory

1476
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:38,060
would turn into a slaughter. For years, Sega tried to set themselves apart from Nintendo

1477
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:43,180
by appealing to an older demographic and marketing their system as the more mature option,

1478
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:47,420
but now Sony was doing the same, and beating Sega at their own game.

1479
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:53,660
In 96, Sega responded to the growing pressure with the release of the Saturn Model 2,

1480
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:58,780
which aimed to lower the retail price and cost of manufacturing. Sony, however,

1481
02:06:58,780 --> 02:07:05,740
replied by cutting the price of the PlayStation to $199, ensuring their lead just kept growing.

1482
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:11,980
For Sega, the situation was starting to look desperate, and the competition would only increase

1483
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:15,660
as an old friend of theirs would soon release a console of their own.

1484
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:21,900
While the fifth console generation was getting off to an explosive start, Nintendo were quietly

1485
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:27,260
enjoying the Super Nintendo's finest years. After a drawn-out and tightly fought competition

1486
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:32,220
with the Genesis, where Sega had often come out on top, in its later years, the supply of

1487
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:38,140
new Genesis games slowed up, allowing Nintendo to finally pull comfortably ahead in a 16-bit market

1488
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:44,940
that was still going surprisingly strong. This may have been partly because 1995-96

1489
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:51,100
saw some of the Super Nintendo's best games. Super Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island, saw Mario

1490
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:57,100
return with a stunning new art style and fresh Yoshi-focused gameplay. Rare followed up the

1491
02:07:57,100 --> 02:08:03,100
monstrously successful Donkey Kong Country with not one, but two more sequels that almost matched

1492
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:08,940
the first in sales. And RPG fans were spoiled for choice, with the cult classic Earthbound's

1493
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:14,220
idiosyncratic take on modern America offering a setting unlike anything players had seen before,

1494
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:20,140
Square and Nintendo's collaborative Super Mario RPG offering a Mario game unlike anything

1495
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:26,140
players had seen before, and Final Fantasy's latest entry, 6 or 3 depending on region,

1496
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:29,980
providing the series' highest rated and best-selling title to date.

1497
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:35,820
Lastly, there was also Chrono Trigger, which was developed by a dream team that included

1498
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:40,620
the creator of the Final Fantasy series, the creator of the Dragon Quest series, and the creator of

1499
02:08:40,620 --> 02:08:46,300
the Dragon Ball Manga. Chrono Trigger featured a time-travelling adventure with multiple endings,

1500
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:52,380
lots of reactivity, and some of the best visuals and music of a 16-bit era, and it's often considered

1501
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:59,180
to be one of the best JRPGs of all time. Still, as strong as the Super Nintendo's last years were,

1502
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:04,060
nothing can last forever, at least not in the always-evolving gaming industry,

1503
02:09:04,060 --> 02:09:09,820
and development of Nintendo's next console started as far back as early 1993.

1504
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:16,140
After their development of a CD-based system failed to work out with either Sony or Philips,

1505
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:20,060
Nintendo formed a new partnership with Silicon Graphics to bring their powerful

1506
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:26,940
supercomputer technology to the world of consoles. The final product released in 1996,

1507
02:09:26,940 --> 02:09:35,180
with the name Nintendo 64 to emphasize its 64 bits of computing. But as powerful as Nintendo's

1508
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:40,860
new system might have been, it was about to face heavy competition, and its main rival had a head

1509
02:09:40,860 --> 02:09:54,300
start alongside one other key advantage. Nintendo arrived late, but the N64 did have some things

1510
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:59,580
in its favor. Nintendo's continued focus on affordability meant the system was able to match

1511
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:04,060
for new prices of Saturn and PlayStation, while offering much more powerful hardware.

1512
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:10,300
We've doubled the PlayStation's RAM at three times faster CPU, and a much higher polygon count

1513
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:14,540
that 3D graphics of the N64 were simply a step above any of their competitors.

1514
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:20,060
Nintendo also innovated with their controller by adding a thumb-controlled analog stick,

1515
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:25,900
reminiscent of the joysticks of older gaming systems. The overall design might seem clunky by

1516
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:30,460
today's standards, but it was an important step for the time, and analog controls greatly

1517
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:36,700
complemented the move to 3D. The N64 also came with four controller ports, which was two more

1518
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:42,940
than its rivals, and made it a great system for multiplayer games. Nintendo's launch lineup

1519
02:10:42,940 --> 02:10:48,220
initially looked less promising, with only two games available for the North American release.

1520
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:55,020
This lack of games was what delayed the release to 1996, and for most consoles, two titles would

1521
02:10:55,020 --> 02:11:01,180
never be enough. Luckily for Nintendo, however, one of those games was capable of doing some rather

1522
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:02,380
heavy lifting.

1523
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:34,460
Super Mario 64 didn't just bring Nintendo's popular mascot into the realm of 3D, it also

1524
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:39,980
shattered expectations for what a 3D platformer could be. Before it, games of the genre had

1525
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:46,780
used fixed cameras, or just suffered from loose, imprecise controls. But using the new analog stick,

1526
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:52,460
Mario was given full 360-degree movement with a detached adjustable camera and a rich array of

1527
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:58,620
movement options. Levels were big and inviting, begging players to explore and experiment,

1528
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:04,300
and the cartoony visual style was a great fit for showcasing the N64's high polygon count.

1529
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:12,060
Basically, it was as strong a launch title as Nintendo could have asked for, but it still

1530
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:19,340
wouldn't be enough. Because as impressive as the N64 and Mario were, there was one thing the

1531
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:27,580
PlayStation did, which Nintendo didn't. And that was used CDs. Nintendo's console was more

1532
02:12:27,580 --> 02:12:34,300
powerful. It did have a higher polygon count and shorter load times, but CDs had higher capacity,

1533
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:39,980
and for many developers, this was the most important factor. The best known example of this

1534
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:45,340
was RPG Veteran Square, who had been a loyal ally to Nintendo and had originally begun work on

1535
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:50,940
their next Final Fantasy game on the Super Nintendo. As development progressed, Square soon

1536
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:55,020
realised they wanted to use pre-rendered video and backgrounds, something that would only be

1537
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:59,260
possible with the larger capacity of the CD, meaning creating the game for Nintendo's new

1538
02:12:59,260 --> 02:13:05,340
console was no longer possible. As development continued, Square invested more and more resources

1539
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:10,140
into the project, resulting in an estimated development budget of more than $14 million,

1540
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:17,420
making it the most expensive game ever made at the time, and it turned out, Square's investment

1541
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:19,500
paid off.

1542
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:57,420
Final Fantasy VII released in 1997, and was unbelievably successful. Its use of full-motion

1543
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:02,780
video and pre-rendered CG gave it a cinematic style which wowed audiences and critics alike.

1544
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:08,540
Its setting and characters felt fresh and exciting in an era years before anime had found

1545
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:13,980
mainstream popularity, and when most Japanese RPGs still didn't even get released outside Japan,

1546
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:18,540
and its story and sense of adventure resonated with players at the time

1547
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:24,860
in a way that few other games ever had. Final Fantasy VII sold over 10 million copies,

1548
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:28,460
eventually going on to become the PlayStation's joint best-selling game of all time.

1549
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:34,780
For Sony, it was the PlayStation's killer app, and they didn't even need to do anything to get it.

1550
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:41,260
The higher capacity of CDs allowed for the use of FMV, as well as higher quality sound,

1551
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:48,300
and even more realistic and detailed textures. And so, the N64 was the more powerful system,

1552
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:54,380
in all ways except for the one which mattered the most. Nintendo weren't out of the competition

1553
02:14:54,380 --> 02:15:00,140
yet though, because there was something they could do which Sony couldn't. Make their own games.

1554
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:06,700
The N64 couldn't match the PlayStation's early sales, but it still got off to a solid start,

1555
02:15:06,700 --> 02:15:11,580
thanks in large part to Nintendo's strong pre-established reputation, and more games

1556
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:20,780
were soon on the way. At the end of 1996, Mario 64 was joined by Mario Kart 64, bringing kart racing

1557
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:27,180
to the third dimension, and giving the system its second best-selling game. In 97, Nintendo continued

1558
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:33,580
venue naming convention with the well-received Star Fox 64, and gave Mario Sidekick Yoshi

1559
02:15:33,580 --> 02:15:40,300
his own standalone title with Yoshi's Story. They also received invaluable support from the then

1560
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:46,460
second-party developer Rare, who were about to give the console one of the era's most iconic games.

1561
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:22,460
Goldeneye 007 single-handedly proved that first-person shooters could work on consoles,

1562
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:28,540
and they could work well. Taking inspiration from Doom, but opting for a more realistic approach,

1563
02:16:28,540 --> 02:16:33,100
Goldeneye featured a memorable single-player campaign that did an admirable job of providing a

1564
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:38,860
James Bond-like experience, complete with a rich story, varied levels and stealth elements,

1565
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:44,380
but it was multiplayer that the game is best remembered for. By bringing the fun of the

1566
02:16:44,380 --> 02:16:49,740
deathmatch to consoles, Goldeneye proved to be a massive success, and went on to sell over 8

1567
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:56,380
million copies, putting it only behind Mario 64 and Mario Kart as the system's best-selling game.

1568
02:16:56,780 --> 02:17:03,420
And the hits from Rare didn't stop at Goldeneye. They also gave the system a second popular

1569
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:08,220
kart racer with Diddy Kong Racing, before kicking off a new critically-acclaimed platforming series

1570
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:14,700
with Banjo-Kazooie, before following this with Donkey Kong's successful 3D debut in Donkey Kong 64,

1571
02:17:14,700 --> 02:17:20,300
and finally by providing worthy successors to both Goldeneye and Banjo-Kazooie in 2000

1572
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:25,900
with Perfect Dark and Banjo 2e. Nintendo also had more important games of their own,

1573
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:29,820
with two in particular going on to help define the fifth console generation.

1574
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:35,420
The first would see the return of Nintendo's other flagship series and produced what may be

1575
02:17:35,420 --> 02:17:41,260
the most critically-acclaimed game of all time. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

1576
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:47,740
released in late 1998 and made the transition to 3D while retaining the series' focus on exploration

1577
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:54,460
and adventure. With intuitive combat, intricate dungeon design and a huge world full of secrets,

1578
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:59,580
Ocarina of Time was a staggeringly well-made game, but what truly elevated it to one of

1579
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:06,540
gaming's all-time greats was its sense of atmosphere and weight. At times, dark, somber,

1580
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:11,900
and even surreal, Link's quest to the feet Ganondorf felt as epic as it was enchanting,

1581
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:18,380
in a way rarely matched in the medium before or since. Nintendo also gave the world a new take

1582
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:25,580
on the fighting genre in 1999 with Super Smash Bros. Featuring an all-star cast of classic Nintendo

1583
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:30,860
characters, Smash moved the focus away from character-specific combos to create a more

1584
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:35,740
approachable but no less enjoyable fighting game that was unlike anything else on the market.

1585
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:41,660
Still, as impressive as Nintendo's first and second-party titles were in this period,

1586
02:18:41,660 --> 02:18:44,540
they still weren't enough to match the PlayStation's ever-growing lineup.

1587
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:49,420
With so many developers favouring Sony's system because of its ease of development

1588
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:54,380
and the advantages of CDs, Nintendo was left with little third-party support,

1589
02:18:54,380 --> 02:18:59,500
and the more the PlayStation user base grew, the more developers wanted their games to be on it.

1590
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:05,900
Sony finished the decades strongly. They took inspiration from Nintendo to produce

1591
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:11,260
their own dual analog controller in 1997. They transitioned their marketing from targeting

1592
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:16,060
Sega towards directly targeting Nintendo after Nintendo became the main competition,

1593
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:21,180
and with each new year they saw multiple major titles but ensured the PlayStation's dominant

1594
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:28,940
position grew and grew. 1997 brought well-received sequels to Tomb Raider and Crash Bandicoot,

1595
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:33,500
alongside the only other game that could match Final Fantasy and Sales numbers, Gran Turismo.

1596
02:19:34,380 --> 02:19:39,420
Produced by Polyphony Digital, a new Japanese-based first-party studio within Sony,

1597
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:44,540
Gran Turismo received universal acclaim and set a new bar for graphics and realism in a driving

1598
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:49,740
game, surpassing even arcade competition in a somewhat symbolic step for the industry.

1599
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:57,980
In 1998, Sony's lineup was arguably even stronger, with widely successful sequels to Resident Evil,

1600
02:19:57,980 --> 02:20:03,340
Tekken, Crash Bandicoot and Tomb Raider that would be joined by high-selling new series,

1601
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:08,860
like Insomniac's Spiroba Dragon. Perhaps the year's biggest surprise came from

1602
02:20:08,860 --> 02:20:14,300
another ex-Nintendo ally when Konami released their latest entry into the Metal Gear series.

1603
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:20,860
Much like Final Fantasy VII before it, Metal Gear Solid wowed players with its cinematic focus,

1604
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:27,100
this time produced through in-engine cutscenes, alongside full voice acting and an unusually

1605
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:33,180
mature and complicated storyline. The result was one of the most story-focused and cinematic

1606
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:40,300
experiences ever seen in a game, and it too would receive universal acclaim alongside 7 million copies

1607
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:48,460
sold. 1999 was once more a packed year with even more sequels, this time to Final Fantasy,

1608
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:55,180
Resident Evil, Spiro, Tomb Raider and Gran Turismo, alongside a new survival horror game from Konami

1609
02:20:55,180 --> 02:21:00,700
in Silent Hill and a kart racer to compete with Nintendo in the form of Crash Team Racing.

1610
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:07,020
As the console generation progressed, the reality of the situation became clear. Sony's lineup of

1611
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:11,500
games was simply too strong, and it allowed the PlayStation to maintain the dominant lead on

1612
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:17,900
its competition from its release all the way to its discontinuation 12 years later. In the process,

1613
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:23,340
the PlayStation became the first console in history to surpass 100 million units sold,

1614
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:27,580
which was more than twice that of the previous generation's leader, the Super Nintendo,

1615
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:35,500
and almost 70 million more than Sony's closest competition, the N64. By contrast, the Saturn

1616
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:43,500
sold only 9.2 million, leaving Sega a distant third place and in serious trouble. During this

1617
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:47,980
period, disagreements over the company's future between the Japanese and American divisions were

1618
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:53,580
reported to be frequent. Ultimately, the rapidly declining profits led the company to discontinue

1619
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:59,260
the Saturn in 1998 in favour of focusing on the next generation, where they hoped to get a head

1620
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:04,620
start on the competition. Throughout the development of their next console, Sega tried to learn from

1621
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:09,500
their mistakes with the Saturn by paying close attention to production costs and trying to select

1622
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:16,060
hardware components similar to personal computers to assist software development. The system also

1623
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:21,020
used a custom version of Windows operating system to further help with porting games between PC

1624
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:27,100
and was the first console to include a built-in modular modem to enable internet access and

1625
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:33,580
online play. In the end, the console was completed while the fifth generation was still going strong,

1626
02:22:33,580 --> 02:22:39,420
and in November 1998, it released in Japan, with a global release coming one year later.

1627
02:22:51,180 --> 02:23:13,020
The Dreamcast got off to a slow but steady start. Pre-orders in Japan were high,

1628
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:17,500
but hardware shortages meant Sega couldn't keep up with demand, meaning they failed to meet their

1629
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:23,180
initial sales goals. The American launch went smoother, however, and the first year sales seemed

1630
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:29,180
promising. The launch lineup included a number of first-party titles, but its two big early stars

1631
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:36,380
would be Sonic Adventures and Soul Calibur. The first represented Sonic's first true 3D debut

1632
02:23:36,380 --> 02:23:40,540
and quickly became the system's best-selling game, while Namco's Soul Calibur was one of the

1633
02:23:40,540 --> 02:23:45,580
most highly acclaimed fighting games of all time and is notable as being graphically superior to

1634
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:52,460
its arcade counterpart and showcasing just how much next-gen systems could do. Still,

1635
02:23:52,460 --> 02:23:56,940
early sales were one thing, but the true test for Sega would be when their competition joined the

1636
02:23:56,940 --> 02:24:03,820
sixth generation, and for that, they wouldn't need to wait long. And so, the decade came to a

1637
02:24:03,820 --> 02:24:09,820
close where after years of intense neck-and-neck battle between Sega and Nintendo, it was Sony

1638
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:17,100
who ultimately came out as the winner, and they won by some way. For Nintendo, the end of the 90s

1639
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:22,300
weren't all bad, however, because there was one area where they remained firmly on top.

1640
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:34,300
The Game Boy released in 1989 and quickly surpassed its technologically superior competition.

1641
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:39,580
Nintendo supported their new handheld system with a number of first-party continuations of

1642
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:47,020
classic Nintendo series. This meant more Mario, with Super Mario Land 2 before new series antagonist

1643
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:54,300
Wario got his first game in Wario Land Super Mario Land 3. The Game Boy also got a sequel to Metroid,

1644
02:24:54,300 --> 02:24:59,580
with Metroid 2 Return of Samus, as well as a new 2D Zelda with Link's Awakening.

1645
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:06,460
Other notable early Game Boy games include Puzzle Game Dr. Mario, Kirby's First Ever Outing in

1646
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:11,980
Kirby's Dreamland, and a continuation of the original Donkey Kong series, as well as a portable

1647
02:25:11,980 --> 02:25:18,540
title from Rare called Donkey Kong Land. These games were all well received and helped the Game Boy

1648
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:24,460
to continue strong, but it would be a new series which came to define handheld gaming in the 90s.

1649
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:30,300
Before that, Nintendo would release the highly experimental and rather disastrous

1650
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:36,380
Virtual Boy in 1995, a 32-bit technically portable headset and controller.

1651
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:42,140
The Virtual Boy was the first console capable of displaying stereoscopic 3D,

1652
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:47,260
although it was only in red and black, and there were concerns about long-term use,

1653
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:52,940
causing permanent eye damage. It was also pushed to market before it was truly ready

1654
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:58,220
and received negative reviews for its high price, uncomfortable design, and weak selection of games

1655
02:25:58,220 --> 02:26:04,540
that struggled to use its novel 3D effect in interesting ways. Ultimately, the Virtual Boy

1656
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:09,900
ended as a clear failure, and was discontinued less than a year after its launch before even

1657
02:26:09,900 --> 02:26:16,540
receiving a European release, but it was at least one of gaming's more innovative and unique failures.

1658
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:22,700
For Nintendo, this appointment wouldn't last long, however, because they were about to stumble

1659
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:26,300
onto a game that would single-handedly conquer the world.

1660
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:51,500
Pokemon released in 1996 in Japan, 1998 in America, and 1999 in Europe. It was inspired by creator

1661
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:57,020
Satoshi Tajiri's childhood hobby of collecting insects, but upon hearing the idea for the game,

1662
02:26:57,020 --> 02:27:02,860
Nintendo were initially skeptical. In the end, it was support from Shigeru Miyamoto

1663
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:07,740
that helped get the game off the ground, with the Game Boy's link cable enabled multiplayer

1664
02:27:07,740 --> 02:27:12,460
acting as a major influence in creating a game focused on collecting and trading,

1665
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:18,460
rather than being a more traditional RPG. The idea to have different versions of the same

1666
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:23,580
game with exclusive Pokemon came from Miyamoto, who thought it would encourage the game's social

1667
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:32,060
aspects. And in the end, Miyamoto and Tajiri would be proving right, but success didn't happen overnight.

1668
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:38,700
After a long and problematic development, Pocket Monsters Red and Green released in

1669
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:44,860
Japan to decent but not remarkable sales. By the end of its first year, the game sold over

1670
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:50,220
1 million copies in Japan alone, but then, instead of slowing down like most releases,

1671
02:27:50,220 --> 02:27:57,500
Pocket Monsters did the opposite. With a blue and yellow version released later to renew interest

1672
02:27:57,500 --> 02:28:02,860
and strong word of mouth as a result of the game's social aspects, sales just continued to grow,

1673
02:28:02,860 --> 02:28:11,020
with 3.65 million copies sold in Japan in 1997. To put this in perspective, the total lifetime

1674
02:28:11,020 --> 02:28:17,420
sales for the Game Boy in the region at this time was only 7 million, but then Game Boy sales

1675
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:24,300
started to shoot up as well. By the end of a slow localization process, Nintendo and Game Freak

1676
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:29,980
had finally started to realize the potential value of what they had their hands on, and so they decided

1677
02:28:29,980 --> 02:28:35,100
to increase the game's marketing, tying the game's promotion to the upcoming anime and the series

1678
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:43,660
mascot, Pikachu. Across America and Europe, Pokemon Red and Blue broke sales record after sales

1679
02:28:43,660 --> 02:28:51,420
record, with 31 million copies sold worldwide, or 46 million including all versions. It was later

1680
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:57,180
described as the most successful video game of all time and received the world record for best

1681
02:28:57,180 --> 02:29:03,900
selling video game excluding bundle sales. In short, Pokemon was a phenomenon unlike anything

1682
02:29:03,900 --> 02:29:09,660
seen before in the history of gaming, and it was a phenomenon that didn't stop at the games.

1683
02:29:10,860 --> 02:29:17,660
An anime, a card game, merchandise, accessories, movies, spinoffs, sequels and more, all in mere

1684
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:22,540
months as the franchise grew and grew, with children all around the world doing whatever

1685
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:29,100
they could to get their hands on anything and everything Pokemon. For a short period of time,

1686
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:33,820
the world seemed to stand still, gripped in the midst of a genuine Pokemonia.

1687
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:40,060
It was possibly the biggest cultural phenomenon the modern world has seen, and it's hard to

1688
02:29:40,060 --> 02:29:47,180
think of any one thing that has matched it since. To this day, Pokemon is the highest grossing media

1689
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:54,300
franchise in the world, surpassing Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Marvel, and it doesn't

1690
02:29:54,380 --> 02:30:00,140
look like anything will be catching up with it anytime soon. If there were any doubts still

1691
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:05,500
about the gaming industry's mainstream potential by the late 90s, they didn't survive the arrival

1692
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:12,700
of Pokemon, and all this, every bit of it, was kicked off on the back of one simple game.

1693
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:18,620
When people talk about the greatest games of all time, there are a lot of obvious choices,

1694
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:21,740
but Pokemon Red and Blue might be one of the most overlooked.

1695
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:27,580
Aimed primarily at children, with a legacy that has far outgrown the original titles,

1696
02:30:27,580 --> 02:30:32,540
it's easy to forget how fresh and addictively enjoyable Pokemon's concept of combining role

1697
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:39,020
playing mechanics with monster collection truly was to players at the time. It provided a perfect

1698
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:44,460
introduction to the RPG genre, but it also added excitement and personality to the experience,

1699
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:48,060
with players feeling a strong sense of attachment to their pocket companions,

1700
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:51,900
and always wanting to see what new creatures awaited them in the next location,

1701
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:57,820
or which Pokemon might evolve next, or what secrets that might be out there in the world

1702
02:30:57,820 --> 02:31:03,900
waiting to be uncovered. The multiplayer aspects and growth of the franchise beyond gaming then

1703
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:08,620
helped turn Pokemon into the unprecedented craze that it became, but that wouldn't have been

1704
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:14,060
possible if not for the strength of the original games, which makes them seem worthy of a special

1705
02:31:14,060 --> 02:31:20,220
place in gaming's history. And as for the Game Boy, it soon received an updated model with the

1706
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:27,500
Game Boy Color, which released globally in late 1998. Its best-selling game was, unsurprisingly,

1707
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:31,900
the next entry into the Pokemon series, but it included full backwards compatibility with the

1708
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:36,940
Game Boy's existing library, allowing Game Boy Color owners to not only play their old games,

1709
02:31:36,940 --> 02:31:43,340
but also play them in color. Amidst surging Pokemonia, the new Game Boy sold well,

1710
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:49,420
with combined sales with the original reaching over 118 million units, making it the fourth

1711
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:55,260
best-selling system of all time. It was also surprisingly long-lasting, with the Game Boy's

1712
02:31:55,260 --> 02:32:02,380
lifespan starting in 1989 and lasting until 2003, which wasn't bad for a system that released

1713
02:32:02,380 --> 02:32:08,940
already far behind its competition in terms of technological power. And as for that competition,

1714
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:15,260
by the mid-90s it barely existed, although the Japanese-only Wonderswan from Bandai did mean

1715
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:21,020
there was at least one other system out there at the end of the decade. Regardless, when it came

1716
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:27,420
to handhelds, the 90s was a period of absolute Nintendo domination, to a degree rarely seen

1717
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:35,020
in the industry before or since. Still, the Game Boy wasn't the only system that ended the decade well.

1718
02:32:39,580 --> 02:32:46,140
On computers, the second half of the 90s are best remembered for the growing presence of online

1719
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:52,540
gaming and for the large number of critically acclaimed genre-defining titles. PC gaming experienced

1720
02:32:52,540 --> 02:32:57,180
slower growth than consoles during this period, but the PlayStation itself marked a move towards

1721
02:32:57,180 --> 02:33:02,220
more PC-friendly development and many of the console's best-selling games like Tomb Raider,

1722
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:08,220
Final Fantasy and Resident Evil were also released on Windows. The PC still had plenty

1723
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:12,780
of exclusives of its own though, and it still led the way in a number of key genres.

1724
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:19,740
1997 kicked off with Blizzard's Action RPG Diablo, which took the role-playing genre in a new

1725
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:26,060
direction and reached new levels of commercial success as a result. Before Diablo, computer RPGs

1726
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:31,180
were known for their complexity and were often seen as rather niche, but Diablo's isometric

1727
02:33:31,180 --> 02:33:37,340
action stripped away some of the depth to instead place a heavier focus on atmosphere, combat and

1728
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:44,540
item progression, going on to sell over 2 million copies as a result. If action didn't appeal to

1729
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:51,420
you, 1997 also saw the release of a major step for more traditional RPGs with Interplay's Fallout,

1730
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:56,860
which featured a bleak post-apocalyptic setting and a morally ambiguous choice-driven storyline

1731
02:33:56,860 --> 02:34:04,060
to provide a fresh take on the role-playing genre. 1997 also saw a landmark real-time strategy game

1732
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:08,940
with Ensemble Studios Age of Empires, which proved to be a popular historical take on the

1733
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:16,220
genre and featured impressive online and network play integration. Its sequel in 1999 was even

1734
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:22,620
more successful and has retained an active multiplayer community to this day. Growing

1735
02:34:22,620 --> 02:34:27,980
access to online connectivity also paved the way for one of the year's most important releases

1736
02:34:27,980 --> 02:34:34,300
in Origin System's Ultima Online, which became the first game to create a multiplayer online

1737
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:41,660
RPG on a genuinely massive scale. Building on what was started with mods many years earlier,

1738
02:34:41,660 --> 02:34:48,700
Ultima Online offered an open-ended player-driven experience with up to 2,500 simultaneous players

1739
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:54,460
in a single virtual world, which far surpassed any other game of the time and popularized the

1740
02:34:54,460 --> 02:35:01,740
idea of the MMO. 1998 saw the focus on online gaming continue with the arrival of Blizzard's

1741
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:08,220
next major series. StarCraft featured a well-made campaign and a rich sci-fi setting, but what truly

1742
02:35:08,220 --> 02:35:14,380
set it apart was the popularity of its multiplayer. Using Blizzard's integrated Battle.net service,

1743
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:20,540
StarCraft offered fast and efficient matchmaking and its highly distinctive yet well-balanced factions

1744
02:35:20,540 --> 02:35:26,220
were a perfect fit for competitive multiplayer. This led to it becoming the best-selling RTS game

1745
02:35:26,220 --> 02:35:32,700
of all time, with 11 million copies sold by 2009. It also did much to establish the modern

1746
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:37,740
esports scene as we know it today, particularly with its popularity in South Korea, where televised

1747
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:46,220
commentated tournaments began as early as December 1999. Other important games of 1998 include Grim

1748
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:50,700
Fandango, a highly original point-and-click adventure game from genre veteran's LucasArts,

1749
02:35:51,580 --> 02:35:56,780
Thief the Dark Project, a first-person stealth game from Looking Glass Studios known for its

1750
02:35:56,780 --> 02:36:02,940
immersive design and vast player freedom, and BioWare's Baldur's Gate, a fancy RPG that set a

1751
02:36:02,940 --> 02:36:07,500
new standard for Dungeons & Dragons based video games and marked the start of a new era for the

1752
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:14,940
genre. 1998 would also see Valve make their gaming debut with their genre defining Half-Life.

1753
02:36:16,300 --> 02:36:21,020
With its immersive, seamless story, regular integration of puzzles,

1754
02:36:21,020 --> 02:36:26,620
and humble, scientist protagonist, Half-Life was almost the polar opposite of Doom,

1755
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:30,700
and it showcased the genre's potential for storytelling while proving that first-person

1756
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:38,140
shooters could be much more than just Doom clones. In 1999, Ultimate Online was joined by another

1757
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:45,500
massive MMO by way of EverQuest from Sony Online Entertainment. EverQuest soon surpassed

1758
02:36:45,500 --> 02:36:51,100
Ultimate Online's player count and established the formula of leveling, partying, dungeon running,

1759
02:36:51,100 --> 02:36:55,900
and gearing that would come to define so much of the genre and would be copied by so many future

1760
02:36:55,900 --> 02:37:02,380
games. 1999 also saw the release of Heroes of Might and Magic 3, which gave turn-based strategy

1761
02:37:02,380 --> 02:37:06,700
fans a cult classic title but is still one of the best examples of its genre to this day.

1762
02:37:07,660 --> 02:37:12,620
System Shock 2, which combined role-playing with first-person shooting and survival horror elements

1763
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:18,860
to create a sci-fi cyberpunk classic, and Planescape Torment, which gave the decade one of its most

1764
02:37:18,860 --> 02:37:24,060
memorable RPGs while winning much praise for its mature story, intelligent writing, and thematic

1765
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:30,780
depth. The 90s would close out in fitting fashion, with two multiplayer-focused FPS games going head

1766
02:37:30,780 --> 02:37:37,740
to head for the title of best online shooter. The first was Quake 3 Arena, the latest game from

1767
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:44,700
id Software, and the other was Unreal Tournament from Epic Games. Both games were multiplayer-only

1768
02:37:44,700 --> 02:37:51,500
arena shooters, and both games offered impressive 3D graphics and lightning-fast action. Unreal

1769
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:55,820
stood out for its greater variety of guns and gamemodes, while Quake was often considered the

1770
02:37:55,820 --> 02:38:01,020
game of choice for traditionalists, but regardless of individual allegiance, collectively the two

1771
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:06,220
games represented the pinnacle of arena shooters at a time when arena shooters were the undisputed

1772
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:12,460
kings of the FPS genre. Amongst the already mentioned games were a number of other successful

1773
02:38:12,460 --> 02:38:18,460
series and sequels, including a number of popular simulation and strategy games. Together, these

1774
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:24,380
gave the PC a rather diverse lineup of games, and this was a time when PC gaming was still largely

1775
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:30,540
distinct from that seen on consoles. In the end, though, the 90s were the decade where PC gaming

1776
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:35,260
moved towards the mainstream while still managing to maintain much of what originally made it unique.

1777
02:38:35,900 --> 02:38:39,500
From talented young developers making industry-changing breakthroughs

1778
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:43,580
to the long-running focus on depth and complexity in game design,

1779
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:47,260
or the general tendency of catering to more mature audiences.

1780
02:38:48,540 --> 02:38:53,500
The 90s was also the decade that online gaming made its big breakthrough, which can be seen in

1781
02:38:53,500 --> 02:38:59,100
the popularity of new genres like MMOs, real-time strategy games, and first-person shooters.

1782
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:04,140
With time, online gaming played a greater and greater role in the industry,

1783
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:10,540
but it was PC that led the charge while providing a glimpse at gaming's future in the process.

1784
02:39:17,100 --> 02:39:23,980
The 90s was the decade where gaming grew up. It began with all our war between Sega and Nintendo,

1785
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:29,820
but in the end, it was Sony who emerged victorious, and for once, it wasn't because of game design.

1786
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:35,900
This marked a changing point for the industry. Atari succeeded because they were the ones who

1787
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:41,020
first brought high-quality arcade games to consoles. Nintendo brought console gaming back

1788
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:46,060
from the brink with being Nintendo's seal of approval and a focus on high-quality first-party

1789
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:52,540
titles. Sega finally managed to match Nintendo only after their own Landmark series arrived by

1790
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:58,300
way of Sonic, and the Game Boy flourished thanks in large part to Tetris and later Pokémon.

1791
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:05,020
Sony, however, achieved victory through business and hardware, leaving most of the game design to

1792
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:10,060
those who already knew how and instead placing their focus on effective marketing and designing

1793
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:15,100
a system that appealed to developers through ease of development. This showed the growing

1794
02:40:15,100 --> 02:40:21,580
importance of third parties, who had come a long way since Activision first broke away from Atari

1795
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:28,300
to get the recognition they felt they deserved. Now, third parties were no longer just an annoyance

1796
02:40:28,300 --> 02:40:33,980
and they were no longer optional. Nintendo filled in a great lineup of first-party titles in the

1797
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:38,300
fifth generation, with several being remembered as some of the greatest games of all time,

1798
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:45,100
but the Nintendo 64 had a total of 388 licensed games released in its lifespan

1799
02:40:45,100 --> 02:40:52,860
compared to over 3,000 for the PlayStation. The 90s also saw rapid evolution of technology

1800
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:59,020
and might be the single most transformative decade in gaming. The move to 3D was a major

1801
02:40:59,020 --> 02:41:04,460
part of this, with arcades leading the way in the early 90s alongside certain pioneering PC

1802
02:41:04,460 --> 02:41:10,380
and console releases. By the end of the 90s, however, the entire industry had embraced 3D

1803
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:14,780
technology and the advancements being made within just a few years were staggering.

1804
02:41:16,060 --> 02:41:21,980
Alongside 3D, the 90s was also the decade of the CD, which paved the way for full-motion video,

1805
02:41:21,980 --> 02:41:27,260
realistic audio and more detailed textures, and the decade where online gaming and competitive

1806
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:31,580
multiplayer found their footing, with several new genres being established which would only

1807
02:41:31,580 --> 02:41:38,220
grow in importance in the years to come. Finally, for game design, the 90s was the decade where

1808
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:44,860
games started to go big and to shed their arcade origins. If someone were to try to pinpoint the

1809
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:52,700
start of AAA gaming, it might have to be Final Fantasy VII. With a huge budget, a massive marketing

1810
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:58,300
campaign and a development staff of over 100 people, it was simply a different kind of game

1811
02:41:58,300 --> 02:42:04,060
to what was being produced at the start of the decade. For comparison, many of Nintendo's most

1812
02:42:04,060 --> 02:42:10,780
iconic 16-bit games had development teams of around 10 to 20, but with new technology came

1813
02:42:10,780 --> 02:42:16,620
higher demands on game developers and by the end of the 90s, games in general were becoming bigger

1814
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:23,260
and more expensive to create. The 90s also saw a substantial move towards the cinematic

1815
02:42:23,260 --> 02:42:28,060
and the idea of games as a unique medium to tell stories rather than just as a set of challenges

1816
02:42:28,060 --> 02:42:33,660
for players to overcome. This can be seen in titles like Metal Gear Solid and Half-Life

1817
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:37,340
and their popularity clearly showed that this approach resonated with players.

1818
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:43,260
While at the same time as this, traditional arcade features like high scores and lives

1819
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:46,620
were starting to disappear amongst gaming's most popular titles.

1820
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:53,260
Overall though, the 90s was an exciting time for gaming, with fierce rivalries, impressive

1821
02:42:53,260 --> 02:43:00,060
technological progress and many new emerging genres. But as a new millennium beckoned,

1822
02:43:00,060 --> 02:43:04,220
the industry was getting ready to experience rapid change all over again.

1823
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:14,140
The 2000s were a massive decade for video games.

1824
02:43:15,100 --> 02:43:21,420
Technological innovations of the 90s matured with rapid advances in 3D and online. The console

1825
02:43:21,420 --> 02:43:26,940
wars continued with the arrival of the next and final major player, followed by a seventh generation

1826
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:32,060
that no one could have predicted. And game development moved further towards the AAA,

1827
02:43:32,060 --> 02:43:36,940
at the same time that new areas of the industry started to arrive, changing gaming forever more.

1828
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:43,340
Still, at the dawn of the new millennium, the gaming industry was defined by uncertainty.

1829
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:49,660
After months of panic about a Y2K computing apocalypse that in the end didn't happen,

1830
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:55,500
the industry then ran headfirst into a much realer crisis when the dot-com bubble burst,

1831
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:59,740
leading to a stock market crash that hit the tech industry particularly hard,

1832
02:43:59,740 --> 02:44:04,540
all of while gamers around the world held their breath in anticipation of the next generation

1833
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:11,340
of consoles. Many questions were on people's minds. How would Sony follow up the most successful

1834
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:16,220
console of all time? How would Nintendo respond to losing the top spot in the previous generation?

1835
02:44:16,860 --> 02:44:21,900
Would Sega be able to do enough to survive? And what would be the impact of the computing

1836
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:26,060
giant Microsoft throwing their hat into the increasingly crowded arena?

1837
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:31,580
Before the next wave of systems could really get going, however, the previous generation

1838
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:36,620
enjoyed one of its finest years, as developers pushed fifth-gen consoles to their limits,

1839
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:43,660
and PC saw the arrival of its best-selling game yet. Highlights on the Nintendo 64

1840
02:44:43,660 --> 02:44:48,220
include the surreal sequel to Ocarina of Time, a legend of Zelda Majora's Mask,

1841
02:44:48,220 --> 02:44:53,500
which featured a time loop mechanic alongside a surprisingly dark tone to create an experience

1842
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:59,980
just as memorable as its predecessor and almost as universally acclaimed. Perfect Dark from N64

1843
02:44:59,980 --> 02:45:04,460
Heavyweight Rare, which was a spiritual successor to GoldenEye that built upon the landmark Shooters

1844
02:45:04,460 --> 02:45:08,940
gameplay while adding a multitude more options to create the fifth generation's definitive

1845
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:15,020
first-person shooter, and Paper Mario, which continued the Mario RPG tradition established

1846
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:19,580
on the Super Nintendo with a new take on the concept and a new two-dimensional art style.

1847
02:45:21,260 --> 02:45:25,500
On the PlayStation, Final Fantasy continued its strong critical and commercial run with Final

1848
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:30,940
Fantasy 9, which featured a return to the more traditional fancy settings of older games alongside

1849
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:36,380
some of the most spectacular pre-rendered graphics on the system. 2000 was also a year that Final

1850
02:45:36,380 --> 02:45:41,820
Fantasy was joined by the 32-bit debut of its great rival in Dragon Quest 7, which quickly

1851
02:45:41,820 --> 02:45:46,940
went on to become the best-selling PlayStation game of all time in Japan despite its late release.

1852
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:53,660
And finally, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 refined the formula of its 1999 predecessor to become one

1853
02:45:53,660 --> 02:45:59,500
of the most critically acclaimed games ever made. It might be tempting to see Tony Hawk's as just

1854
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:04,700
a series of well-made skating games, but to do so would be a great injustice, as they were clear

1855
02:46:04,700 --> 02:46:09,900
examples of games so good they transcended their genre with simple yet addictively enjoyable

1856
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:14,380
gameplay that helped them secure an immortal place within early 2000s gaming culture.

1857
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:21,100
The PC also saw its share of big releases, with RPG fans in particular being spoilt for choice.

1858
02:46:22,220 --> 02:46:27,180
Bioware's follow-up to Baldur's Gate provided an expansive and deep sequel that still remains

1859
02:46:27,180 --> 02:46:32,380
as one of the best examples of its genre to this day. Ion Storm's cyberpunk conspiracy

1860
02:46:32,380 --> 02:46:37,100
thriller Deus Ex impressed with its open-ended mission design and high level of player choice,

1861
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:43,340
and Blizzard's loop-filled action RPG series Diablo returned in its second entry with improvements

1862
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:49,420
to gameplay and a story that made it even more popular than its predecessor. 2000s would also

1863
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:54,140
see the release of another important FPS that offered something markedly different from the

1864
02:46:54,140 --> 02:47:00,380
popular arena shooters of the time. Originally a mod for Half-Life, Counter-Strike placed a

1865
02:47:00,380 --> 02:47:05,180
greater focus on realism and the tactical side of the genre and quickly received plenty of attention

1866
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:10,620
online including from Half-Life creators Valve who offered to buy the intellectual property

1867
02:47:10,620 --> 02:47:16,460
and hire the mods creator before releasing the game officially. Counter-Strike helped create

1868
02:47:16,460 --> 02:47:21,500
an enduring esports scene as well as a number of hugely successful sequels and showed the

1869
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:26,220
innovative nature and potential benefits of a game supporting modding, something that has

1870
02:47:26,220 --> 02:47:32,780
become increasingly rare in games as times went on. Of course none of the games mentioned so far

1871
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:39,340
come close to matching the impact of the year's biggest release. From Maxis and SimCity creator

1872
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:46,540
Will Wright, The Sims was like nothing else before it. As a social simulation with impressive

1873
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:52,380
building tools, Sims turned life itself into a video game and wowed players with the amount of

1874
02:47:52,380 --> 02:47:58,300
freedom it gave them and the level of detail it managed to include. From carefully guiding your

1875
02:47:58,300 --> 02:48:03,980
Sims up the corporate ladder and finally purchasing the local mega mansion to turning their life into

1876
02:48:03,980 --> 02:48:10,620
an inescapable never-ending hell, The Sims was a massive hit with players and received 7 expansions

1877
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:17,100
which was a huge amount for the time. It also sold over 11 million copies making it the best

1878
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:22,140
selling PC game of all time until it was overtaken several years later by its sequel.

1879
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:29,180
Much like Pac-Man or Tetris before it, The Sims was a game which found unprecedented levels of

1880
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:35,900
success by appealing to people who may not have typically played video games. By 2000 personal

1881
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:41,260
computers were starting to become a common household item and The Sims universally understandable

1882
02:48:41,260 --> 02:48:46,860
concept and general accessibility made it the perfect gateway to the medium for those who may

1883
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:51,900
not have been swayed by the fast paced deathmatches of Quake or the advanced Dungeons and Dragons

1884
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:59,580
of computer RPGs. Accessibility and broadened appeal would be a major part of the decade but

1885
02:48:59,580 --> 02:49:04,780
not before the next generation of console wars got underway in fittingly dramatic fashion.

1886
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:15,820
The Dreamcast got off to a solid start and its launch lineup was followed by a number of memorable

1887
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:21,340
titles. The most important was Shenmue which Sega hoped to be the system's killer app.

1888
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:28,540
Featuring advanced 3D graphics and FMV cutscenes alongside a detailed open world complete with

1889
02:49:28,540 --> 02:49:34,300
NPC schedules, variable weather effects and a day-night cycle Shenmue was a major step forward

1890
02:49:34,300 --> 02:49:40,460
for open world game design. Ambitious, innovative and technologically impressive it received much

1891
02:49:40,460 --> 02:49:48,300
critical praise and sold well although unfortunately not well enough. With development costs of around

1892
02:49:48,300 --> 02:49:54,300
50 million dollars Shenmue was one of the most expensive games ever made and its sales of 1.2

1893
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:59,820
million weren't enough to recoup such a high investment. It also didn't become the major

1894
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:05,420
system seller Sega hoped it would be meaning for the Dreamcast there was still more work that needed

1895
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:12,540
to be done. Other strong early performers on the system included Crazy Taxi, an arcade infused

1896
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:18,940
action packed racing game, Jet Set Radio a skating action hybrid that embodied counterculture and was

1897
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:24,780
one of the first games to feature the use of cell shading and Fantasy Star Online a continuation of

1898
02:50:24,780 --> 02:50:32,700
Sega's popular fantasy star series and the first ever online RPG to appear on consoles. Fantasy Star

1899
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:38,220
Online showcased the Dreamcast's impressive online capabilities and was particularly successful

1900
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:44,780
with Japanese audiences where online PC gaming still hadn't really caught on. In the end though

1901
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:50,940
the Dreamcast's fate would be decided more by its competition than its games and 2000

1902
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:55,260
was the year that Sony's next gen successor was ready to make its debut.

1903
02:51:08,460 --> 02:51:15,580
Following the tremendous success of the PlayStation many were left wondering how Sony would top the

1904
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:22,140
best selling games console of all time. Sony's answer was to leave people wondering meaning

1905
02:51:22,140 --> 02:51:27,020
information about the PlayStation 2's development was kept as secret as possible with Sony refusing

1906
02:51:27,020 --> 02:51:33,420
to even confirm that they were working on a new system. Secrecy wouldn't last forever though and

1907
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:40,620
at the Tokyo Game Show in September of 1999 the PlayStation 2 was revealed with demos for Gran Turismo

1908
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:46,540
and Tekken to show off its next gen graphical capability. It wasn't the games or graphics

1909
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:51,020
that impressed the audience the most though but rather two specific design features.

1910
02:51:52,220 --> 02:51:56,940
The first was full backwards compatibility that covered the entire PlayStation 1 library

1911
02:51:56,940 --> 02:52:02,220
as well as some of its accessories like its controllers. At the time backwards compatibility

1912
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:07,740
was an often requested feature yet the only other console to provide it without additional add-ons

1913
02:52:07,740 --> 02:52:15,260
had been the otherwise disappointing Atari 7800. And if backwards compatibility alone wasn't enough

1914
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:21,340
the PlayStation 2 also included a built-in DVD player. This was when DVD players were still

1915
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:28,220
relatively new and standalone units could often cost more than the PS2's 299 launch price which

1916
02:52:28,300 --> 02:52:33,900
made it seem like great value for money and helped its reputation as being more than just a games console.

1917
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:39,420
When this was combined with the strong momentum behind Sony's brand after the success of their

1918
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:45,020
last system it was enough to ensure the PlayStation 2's launch was a big success with the new console

1919
02:52:45,020 --> 02:52:51,740
selling out in Japan and later America as Sony struggled to meet the high demand. The launch

1920
02:52:51,740 --> 02:52:56,780
lineup was also noticeably weak with few heavy hitters outside of perhaps Tekken tag tournament

1921
02:52:56,780 --> 02:53:03,420
from Namco and low first party titles from Sony but in the end this didn't matter too much as in

1922
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:09,820
October 2000 the PlayStation 2 finally arrived in America and quickly became the public's most

1923
02:53:09,820 --> 02:53:12,860
wanted games console.

1924
02:53:40,460 --> 02:53:46,540
For Sega the impact was immediate and amidst now rapidly declining Dreamcast sales

1925
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:52,060
and yearly losses of over 400 million dollars the discontinuation of a Dreamcast was announced

1926
02:53:52,060 --> 02:53:59,980
on the 31st of January 2001. This would be the end of the line for Sega's hardware aspirations

1927
02:53:59,980 --> 02:54:06,300
but they would live on as a third party developer and publisher and in March 2003 the company finally

1928
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:12,940
had a profitable year again after five years of consecutive losses. As for Sony having collected

1929
02:54:12,940 --> 02:54:18,300
one scalp already they turned their attention to those who remained and prepared themselves

1930
02:54:18,300 --> 02:54:22,300
for what would go on to be one of the biggest years in video game history.

1931
02:54:37,260 --> 02:54:44,700
Microsoft unveiled their debut gaming system at the consumer electronic show in January 2001

1932
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:49,900
and right from the start Microsoft wanted the world to know how seriously they were taking

1933
02:54:49,900 --> 02:54:54,620
the industry with major marketing campaigns being launched alongside offers to acquire

1934
02:54:54,620 --> 02:55:02,620
several big players including Nintendo, Square and EA. The decision to enter the console space came

1935
02:55:02,620 --> 02:55:08,300
after seeing the PlayStation success in the last generation with then-CEO Bill Gates worried that

1936
02:55:08,300 --> 02:55:13,740
an unopposed Sony could become so dominant that they might threaten Microsoft's line of Windows

1937
02:55:13,740 --> 02:55:20,300
PCs. Microsoft had also seen the way the PlayStation's PC focus development kits had won them third

1938
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:27,420
party support which led to the idea of just creating a console using PC hardware and DirectX

1939
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:34,220
programming interfaces with the use of DirectX being what led to the console being named Xbox.

1940
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:41,100
The result was a powerful system with technical specifications notably beyond any of its competitors.

1941
02:55:42,060 --> 02:55:47,900
The console included a built-in DVD player just like the PS2 as well as a hard drive and impressive

1942
02:55:47,900 --> 02:55:57,260
online support but Microsoft was called MicroSoft for a reason i.e. they were a software company

1943
02:55:57,580 --> 02:56:01,660
meaning that at the time they had no actual experience in manufacturing hardware.

1944
02:56:02,860 --> 02:56:08,860
This led to expensive development and manufacturing costs with Microsoft ultimately making a loss

1945
02:56:08,860 --> 02:56:15,020
on each unit sold. Still luckily for them if there was one thing Microsoft did have available

1946
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:22,300
it was money and in November 2001 the Xbox released in America three days before the

1947
02:56:22,300 --> 02:56:44,940
arrival of the sixth gen's final contender. Nintendo might have been down after their last

1948
02:56:44,940 --> 02:56:50,300
gen defeat in the PlayStation but unlike Sega they were far from out with dominance still in the

1949
02:56:50,300 --> 02:56:57,100
handheld market and a strong selection of established first party series. For their next system

1950
02:56:57,100 --> 02:57:02,540
Nintendo's priority was to avoid the mistakes which cost them with their last console. This

1951
02:57:02,540 --> 02:57:08,220
meant no more cartridges although they didn't opt for a DVD based system either and instead used the

1952
02:57:08,220 --> 02:57:14,300
more data limited mini-disc. They also tried to ensure the system was easier to develop for

1953
02:57:14,300 --> 02:57:17,420
and that it didn't release significantly later than the rest of the competition.

1954
02:57:18,380 --> 02:57:24,940
Nintendo did try out several more experimental features including stereoscopic 3D, motion controls,

1955
02:57:24,940 --> 02:57:30,940
portability and microphone support but for now these ideas played little role in the final console.

1956
02:57:31,980 --> 02:57:37,580
And so Nintendo's GameCube was a fairly traditional system that was less powerful than

1957
02:57:37,580 --> 02:57:44,220
Microsoft's Xbox but with a slight technological edge over Sony's PS2 in CPU and graphics card.

1958
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:49,500
The marketing focused on Nintendo's reputation and first party success

1959
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:55,820
making use of the catchphrase the Nintendo difference but one thing which did remain the same

1960
02:57:55,820 --> 02:57:59,980
was a lack of effort on Nintendo's part to entice third party exclusives.

1961
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:06,380
Nintendo also weren't able to meet their initial target of the holiday season in the year 2000

1962
02:58:06,380 --> 02:58:11,180
which would have seen their new console launch alongside Sony's but at least this time they

1963
02:58:11,180 --> 02:58:18,220
wouldn't be quite so far behind and at E3 2001 the system was fully unveiled with Shigeru Miyamoto

1964
02:58:18,220 --> 02:58:22,860
himself taking to the stage to announce the release date and launch lineup with a later

1965
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:29,420
price reveal putting the GameCube at $199, 100 less than its two rivals.

1966
02:58:30,940 --> 02:58:36,940
Unlike every Nintendo console before it however something or someone was noticeably absent

1967
02:58:36,940 --> 02:58:42,220
as for the first time Nintendo would be launching their system without a Mario game to support it.

1968
02:58:43,340 --> 02:58:49,340
In Mario's place was his brother in Luigi's Mansion which went on to receive positive reviews

1969
02:58:49,340 --> 02:58:53,740
but was a far cry from the generational defining Mario titles of earlier consoles.

1970
02:58:55,180 --> 02:59:00,540
Luckily for Nintendo though even if Luigi wasn't able to develop to his big brother's big reputation

1971
02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:03,820
Nintendo did have another title mere months away which could.

1972
02:59:04,780 --> 02:59:12,140
Super Smash Bros. Melee tipped the formula of its predecessor and ran with it featuring more characters,

1973
02:59:12,140 --> 02:59:17,660
more stages, more gameplay modes, more music and updated multiplayer but ensured it would

1974
02:59:17,660 --> 02:59:23,500
be a hit with fans and critics alike even decades later. Melee went on to be the GameCube's best

1975
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:28,780
selling title and acted as a fantastic showcase of what Nintendo were bringing to the sixth generation.

1976
02:59:29,500 --> 02:59:34,780
Microsoft however had a killer app of their own to mark their entry into the console space.

1977
02:59:35,820 --> 02:59:40,220
Most of Microsoft's early efforts to buy third party developers weren't successful

1978
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:45,020
but one company they did acquire was a relatively unknown yet still successful

1979
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:52,380
Macintosh developer by the name of Bungie. The studio's sci-fi FPS series Marathon was exactly

1980
02:59:52,380 --> 02:59:57,660
the type of game that might appeal to western audiences but its Mac only status had previously

1981
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:03,820
limited its reach. In the late 90s Bungie had begun work on a follow-up to Marathon and after

1982
03:00:03,820 --> 03:00:11,260
it was unveiled at 1999's Mac World Expo by none other than Apple CEO Steve Jobs, Microsoft decided

1983
03:00:11,260 --> 03:00:16,220
to swoop in and make their move, impressing the team at Bungie with their commitment to the gaming

1984
03:00:16,220 --> 03:00:22,380
industry and securing the studio and their new title exclusively for Xbox in the process.

1985
03:00:22,460 --> 03:00:28,380
With this Microsoft had now found their tempo title to centre the Xbox's launch around but for

1986
03:00:28,380 --> 03:00:34,620
Bungie things would be far from simple. The switch from computer to console brought a number of

1987
03:00:34,620 --> 03:00:39,900
development challenges. The team's deadline was incredibly tight and the weight of an entire new

1988
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:47,100
console was being placed quite squarely on their game's shoulders. In the end though Halo proved

1989
03:00:48,060 --> 03:00:53,820
up to the task launching alongside the Xbox and becoming an instant critical and commercial success.

1990
03:00:55,020 --> 03:01:01,660
Halo was a very ambitious game. The biggest surprise then might be that in the end all its

1991
03:01:01,660 --> 03:01:08,540
ambitions seemed to pay off. Featuring vehicle combat alongside massive open world like environments

1992
03:01:08,540 --> 03:01:15,660
with impressive enemy variety, AI behaviour and encounter design Halo was a fantastic game but

1993
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:21,820
even more impressive was how well it played on console. Bungie added subtle auto-aim to

1994
03:01:21,820 --> 03:01:26,940
accommodate for the use of a gamepad over a mouse and used a system of input buffering to make

1995
03:01:26,940 --> 03:01:33,100
movements feel smoother and more precise. The result was a huge step forward for the console

1996
03:01:33,100 --> 03:01:42,460
FPS genre and the creation of Xbox's first true blockbuster title. But while Nintendo had Melee

1997
03:01:42,460 --> 03:01:49,340
and Microsoft had Halo, Sony on the other hand had what might be the single greatest year of

1998
03:01:49,340 --> 03:01:58,620
console exclusives in all of video game history. 2001 was massive for the PlayStation 2. Many of

1999
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:05,260
the PS1's best-selling series would see sequels with Gran Turismo 3, A-Spec, Final Fantasy 10 and

2000
03:02:05,260 --> 03:02:11,500
Metal Gear Solid 2 each releasing to universal acclaim and incredible sales. What's more each

2001
03:02:11,500 --> 03:02:16,220
of these games showcased outstanding graphics making the difference in the new generation

2002
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:22,940
crystal clear to potential buyers. Alongside these was another important title that would leave a

2003
03:02:22,940 --> 03:02:29,500
lasting impact on game design and would kick off the PS2's best-selling series Rockstars

2004
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:37,260
Grand Theft Auto 3. This wasn't the first Grand Theft Auto game but it was the first in 3D and

2005
03:02:37,260 --> 03:02:42,540
its fully open world and emphasis on player freedom was unlike anything that came before it.

2006
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:48,140
It remains a landmark open world game and did much to change people's conception of what

2007
03:02:48,140 --> 03:02:53,980
video games could achieve and this was still just one of many major titles releasing on the

2008
03:02:53,980 --> 03:03:01,340
PlayStation 2 that year. Looking back today the most impressive thing about the PS2's 2001 release

2009
03:03:01,340 --> 03:03:07,900
lineup is surely its diversity with different genres and tastes being catered to and innovative

2010
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:14,300
new titles coming alongside the more expected big sequels. Ico gave players something original,

2011
03:03:14,300 --> 03:03:20,220
mature and creative. Capcom's Devil May Cry brought arcade inspired action and created its own

2012
03:03:20,220 --> 03:03:25,660
new genre in the process. Konami's Silent Hill 2 gave the console one of the greatest horror games

2013
03:03:25,660 --> 03:03:30,940
ever made. Naughty Dogs Jack and Daxter brought Sony a major new series and offered something

2014
03:03:30,940 --> 03:03:37,260
a little more lighthearted and there are other games that could be mentioned here too. The PlayStation

2015
03:03:37,260 --> 03:03:43,740
2's lineup was stacked and this was exactly what Sony needed to keep them on top amidst the launch

2016
03:03:43,740 --> 03:03:50,060
of their rivals new consoles. Still even if the PlayStation 2 would end the year ahead,

2017
03:03:50,060 --> 03:03:55,820
both the Xbox and Gamecube did see strong initial sales with many retailers selling out of the

2018
03:03:55,820 --> 03:04:02,700
systems. Each console also had its own clear advantage with the Gamecube being the cheapest

2019
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:09,900
and the Xbox being the most technologically advanced and so in 2002 Sony set out to take

2020
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:16,940
those advantages away. To do this they cut the price of the PS2 to $199 to bring it in line with

2021
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:22,540
the Gamecube and set about creating a PlayStation Network adapter add on alongside several first

2022
03:04:22,540 --> 03:04:28,940
party online focus titles like Socom to compete with Microsoft soon to be launching Xbox Live.

2023
03:04:30,380 --> 03:04:35,980
2002 would also bring a number of PS2 exclusives with the three biggest being Square's latest

2024
03:04:35,980 --> 03:04:41,420
action RPG Kingdom Hearts which combined Final Fantasy characters with massive Disney franchises,

2025
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:46,460
Insomniac Games Ratchet and Clank, an important action platformer that would get a number of

2026
03:04:46,460 --> 03:04:53,020
sequels on the system and Rockstar's Grand 5th Auto Vice City which followed on from GTA 3

2027
03:04:53,020 --> 03:04:58,860
by bringing the series to a new city and new decade and found even greater success in the process.

2028
03:05:00,380 --> 03:05:05,100
Nintendo and Microsoft had other important titles in the following years as well but each

2029
03:05:05,100 --> 03:05:11,420
company would also experience their own third party struggles. Nintendo did finally receive

2030
03:05:11,500 --> 03:05:16,140
the Mario game they needed with Super Mario Sunshine which featured a tropical setting

2031
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:22,620
and a new spin on 3D Mario gameplay. Other classic Nintendo series would also get new entries

2032
03:05:22,620 --> 03:05:27,980
with Metroid Prime seeing Metroid make its 3D debut in an atmospheric and immersive take on

2033
03:05:27,980 --> 03:05:33,900
earlier games that retained much of what made the original special. Zelda returned with Wind Waker

2034
03:05:33,900 --> 03:05:38,700
which saw players take to the ocean and explore many islands in a new cell shaded art style

2035
03:05:38,700 --> 03:05:44,060
that was a dramatic departure from the previous games. Mario Kart returned with Double Dash

2036
03:05:44,060 --> 03:05:49,740
which replaced the sprite to be N64 version with full 3D and allowed two riders per kart

2037
03:05:49,740 --> 03:05:55,740
to provide a new take on co-op gameplay. Animal Crossing and Pikmin made their debuts giving

2038
03:05:55,740 --> 03:06:01,740
players a relaxed open-ended life sim alongside a highly original real-time strategy puzzle game

2039
03:06:02,380 --> 03:06:07,980
and other Nintendo series like Mario Party rounded out what was admittedly a strong first

2040
03:06:07,980 --> 03:06:15,180
party lineup. When it came to third party support however Nintendo were once more at a disadvantage

2041
03:06:15,180 --> 03:06:19,820
after having done little to secure exclusive third party titles in the lead up to the sixth

2042
03:06:19,820 --> 03:06:26,140
generation. What's more rare a developer who had done more to support Nintendo than any other in

2043
03:06:26,140 --> 03:06:31,420
the last two generations started to experience financial difficulties and were forced to look

2044
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:37,020
for a buyer. Nintendo already had a significant stake in the company and could have purchased the

2045
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:43,420
rest but they instead declined leaving room for other interested parties like Nintendo's newest

2046
03:06:43,420 --> 03:06:50,060
rival Microsoft. While rare did release one Gamecube title before this their acquisition

2047
03:06:50,060 --> 03:06:55,660
by Microsoft still left Nintendo's already lacklustre third party support even more lacking.

2048
03:06:57,180 --> 03:07:01,420
In a strange twist of fate one of Nintendo's most prominent third party developers in this

2049
03:07:01,420 --> 03:07:07,820
period was none other than Sega who brought a number of series to the Gamecube including Sonic

2050
03:07:07,820 --> 03:07:14,700
and Fantasy Star. The only other notable third party that provided exclusives was Capcom who

2051
03:07:14,700 --> 03:07:19,980
would bring a number of Resident Evil games including timed exclusivity on Resident Evil 4

2052
03:07:19,980 --> 03:07:27,500
alongside some new IPs. Still while the Gamecube did have exclusives it also found itself left out

2053
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:34,220
of certain multi-platform releases as the generations stretched on. Some examples include

2054
03:07:34,220 --> 03:07:41,260
Burnout 3, Black, Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2, certain entries into the Pro Evolution

2055
03:07:41,260 --> 03:07:47,340
Soccer series, Hitman contracts and Blood Money, Binlight Club 2 and so on.

2056
03:07:48,380 --> 03:07:53,100
Individually none of these titles may have been deal breakers but the cumulative effect

2057
03:07:53,180 --> 03:07:57,660
meant the Gamecube had the smallest library and came to be seen as the worst system for

2058
03:07:57,660 --> 03:08:04,060
multi-platform games. Microsoft would also eventually bring Grand 5th Auto over to Xbox

2059
03:08:04,060 --> 03:08:09,020
once more leaving Nintendo out of what was arguably the biggest series in gaming at the time.

2060
03:08:10,380 --> 03:08:14,620
To make matters worse Nintendo were also increasingly finding that they were developing

2061
03:08:14,620 --> 03:08:20,300
an image problem in Western markets. Amidst the gaming industry that was putting out more and

2062
03:08:20,300 --> 03:08:26,300
more mature titles and marketing from Sony and Microsoft aimed at securing older audiences,

2063
03:08:26,300 --> 03:08:31,020
Nintendo's Gamecube came to be seen as the console for younger audiences.

2064
03:08:32,460 --> 03:08:37,820
This reputation had been developing since their showdown with Sega but now it was starting to do

2065
03:08:37,820 --> 03:08:43,580
real damage, particularly with teenagers who might place a lot of value on how a gaming system is

2066
03:08:43,580 --> 03:08:51,260
seen by their peers. It may no longer be true today but in the early to mid 2000s Gamecube

2067
03:08:51,260 --> 03:08:59,420
just wasn't cool and this had an impact on sales. Meanwhile with the Xbox, Microsoft also faced

2068
03:08:59,420 --> 03:09:06,140
problems as they struggled to provide Master Chief with any backup. Attempts were made though,

2069
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:10,300
Project Gotham Racing received strong reviews but failed to come close to matching the sales of

2070
03:09:10,300 --> 03:09:16,300
Sony's mega hit Gran Turismo. Blinks the Time Sweeper would see key star from the Sonic series

2071
03:09:16,300 --> 03:09:21,500
creating an Xbox exclusive platformer but it too failed to make a major impact

2072
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:27,340
and new acquisition Rare failed to live up to their past heights with games like Grabbed by

2073
03:09:27,340 --> 03:09:33,740
the Goolies and Conquer Live and Reloaded. Microsoft's most prominent third party support

2074
03:09:33,740 --> 03:09:39,020
came from Japanese publisher Tecmo who made a deal early on with Microsoft and contributed

2075
03:09:39,020 --> 03:09:45,980
the popular fighting series Dead or Alive and the 3D action debut of Ninja Gaiden as well as from

2076
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:53,020
several former PC developers who brought a number of RPGs to the console. These included Bethesda's

2077
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:59,740
breakthrough open world RPG The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind, Lionhead's ambitious new IP Fable

2078
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:05,340
and BioWare's popular Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire.

2079
03:10:05,580 --> 03:10:09,980
These RPGs would go on to be some of the most highly acclaimed titles on the system and further

2080
03:10:09,980 --> 03:10:15,980
cemented Xbox's growing reputation with Western audiences. But compared to the PlayStation 2's

2081
03:10:15,980 --> 03:10:20,860
continually expanding library, the Xbox still had a lot less to offer by comparison.

2082
03:10:22,060 --> 03:10:28,220
As a result, Microsoft placed great hope on their upcoming online service Xbox Live which

2083
03:10:29,180 --> 03:10:33,180
launched one year after the console in November 2002.

2084
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:41,260
Xbox Live was an impressive service for its time, featuring friends lists, voice communication

2085
03:10:41,260 --> 03:10:46,620
and fast matchmaking while making use of an ethernet port and the faster broadband connection

2086
03:10:46,620 --> 03:10:53,020
over the still popular dial up. Its flagship launch title was Epic's Unreal Championship,

2087
03:10:53,020 --> 03:10:57,660
but a disagreement with Electronic Arts over the terms of the new service led to EA

2088
03:10:57,660 --> 03:11:01,500
withholding all of their games from Xbox Live for its first few years.

2089
03:11:02,780 --> 03:11:08,060
Still, Xbox's online system was a success and launched before Sony's alternative

2090
03:11:08,060 --> 03:11:14,060
without the need for any additional hardware. Its impact on the industry hadn't been quite

2091
03:11:14,060 --> 03:11:19,340
as dramatic as Microsoft had hoped for though, or at least it wasn't, until the services

2092
03:11:19,340 --> 03:11:36,140
killer app arrived in 2004. Halo 2's campaign was a solid follow up from the first game,

2093
03:11:36,140 --> 03:11:42,940
but this wasn't the main thing it came to be known for. With Halo 2, Microsoft's best series

2094
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:48,620
was able to take advantage of their console's best feature and it turned out to be a match made

2095
03:11:48,620 --> 03:11:54,140
in heaven. Halo 1's multiplayer had already impressed, but for many players this would

2096
03:11:54,140 --> 03:12:00,460
be their first experience moving from split screen to online and the improvement was dramatic.

2097
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:06,060
Halo 2 quickly became the console's best selling game and the most popular thing on

2098
03:12:06,060 --> 03:12:11,820
Xbox Live, vindicating Microsoft's decision to prioritize online features on their console

2099
03:12:11,900 --> 03:12:16,700
while also creating one of the most fondly remembered multiplayer experiences of all time.

2100
03:12:17,980 --> 03:12:25,500
But as successful as Halo 2 was, it wasn't the best selling game in 2004. In fact, it wasn't even

2101
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:31,500
close, as just when Xbox fans finally had a real reason to celebrate their console's superiority,

2102
03:12:31,500 --> 03:12:37,900
the PlayStation 2 would see the arrival of its own best selling game with Grand Theft Auto San

2103
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:46,300
Andreas, which would go on to reach an unprecedented 17 million copies sold on PlayStation 2 alone.

2104
03:12:47,580 --> 03:12:52,140
San Andreas took the open world design of the previous games and drastically increased the

2105
03:12:52,140 --> 03:12:57,980
scale, featuring three distinct cities instead of one alongside many new features that improved

2106
03:12:57,980 --> 03:13:03,820
immersion and customization. The game did come alongside controversy, particularly after the

2107
03:13:03,820 --> 03:13:08,780
modern community were able to uncover a hidden code left in the game's files but enabled a crude

2108
03:13:08,780 --> 03:13:15,260
sex minigame which led to outrage and a revision of the game's rating from the ESRB to the very

2109
03:13:15,260 --> 03:13:21,260
rarely used adult only rating. Still, this wasn't enough to stop it from becoming one of the most

2110
03:13:21,260 --> 03:13:27,740
successful games of all time and Sony's PlayStation 2 flourished alongside it, receiving an updated

2111
03:13:27,740 --> 03:13:33,020
slim model the month before its release and promptly selling out again during the holiday season.

2112
03:13:34,300 --> 03:13:39,020
The final years of the sixth generation would see Sony continuing to add to their already

2113
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:46,380
strong lineup of games with high selling sequels to Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy,

2114
03:13:46,380 --> 03:13:52,700
Tekken and Kingdom Hearts alongside an impressive new action series in Santa Monica Studios God of War.

2115
03:13:53,980 --> 03:13:58,860
Unique titles came alongside the bigger names as well, with games like Team Icos visually

2116
03:13:58,860 --> 03:14:04,220
stunning and emotionally evocative Shadow of the Colossus or the weird and wonderful Katamari

2117
03:14:04,220 --> 03:14:12,140
Damacy from Namco. Truthfully, neither the Xbox or GameCube had bad lineups of games,

2118
03:14:12,140 --> 03:14:18,460
the PlayStation 2 was just on another level and this would ultimately be reflected in its sales.

2119
03:14:19,820 --> 03:14:26,620
Over its long, long life, the PlayStation 2 sold over 155 million units worldwide,

2120
03:14:27,260 --> 03:14:32,780
making it the best-selling gaming system of all time, a title it still holds to this day.

2121
03:14:34,060 --> 03:14:41,180
By contrast, the Xbox and GameCube sold 24 million and 21.7 million units respectively,

2122
03:14:41,740 --> 03:14:47,260
making this the most decisive victory of any console generation since the Nintendo Entertainment

2123
03:14:47,260 --> 03:14:53,580
System brought the home video game market back from the dead. Sony benefited from strong third

2124
03:14:53,580 --> 03:15:00,140
party support, the built-in DVD player, backwards compatibility, a highly competitive price and

2125
03:15:00,140 --> 03:15:06,380
a growing reputation of excellence in the console market. For both Microsoft and Nintendo,

2126
03:15:06,380 --> 03:15:11,740
there would be silver linings however. The Xbox successfully forged itself a place within the

2127
03:15:11,740 --> 03:15:17,260
console market, took second place in a highly competitive generation and found great success

2128
03:15:17,260 --> 03:15:23,820
with Halo and Xbox Live, two things which showed much promise for the future as online gaming and

2129
03:15:23,820 --> 03:15:30,380
home broadband both continued to become more and more widely adopted. Meanwhile for Nintendo,

2130
03:15:30,380 --> 03:15:35,100
they continued to build on their established first-party series while cementing their reputation

2131
03:15:35,100 --> 03:15:40,540
for making quality games. The GameCube may have suffered due to its perception as being for

2132
03:15:40,540 --> 03:15:47,820
younger audiences, but Nintendo may not have. Younger gamers will one day grow up and by staying

2133
03:15:47,820 --> 03:15:53,180
true to their vision and creating great games for all ages, Nintendo continued to create franchises

2134
03:15:53,180 --> 03:15:58,380
with strong nostalgic appeal and sometimes nostalgia can have great dividends in the future.

2135
03:15:59,740 --> 03:16:04,780
In the end, it seems fitting that the GameCube's best-selling game would be the crossover title

2136
03:16:04,780 --> 03:16:10,460
Super Smash Bros. Melee as no other game better represented the system's appeal or Nintendo's

2137
03:16:10,460 --> 03:16:16,060
strengths. Nintendo's different approach also allowed them to set themselves apart from the

2138
03:16:16,060 --> 03:16:22,300
competition and while that isn't always the best strategy to win, it can sometimes help you survive.

2139
03:16:23,580 --> 03:16:32,860
And ultimately, survive they did, as did Microsoft and while Sony's lead may have looked insurmountable,

2140
03:16:33,420 --> 03:16:37,100
gaming has always been an industry where things can change quickly.

2141
03:16:38,620 --> 03:16:43,820
Before a new wave of consoles could go head-to-head however, the handheld market would finally get

2142
03:16:43,820 --> 03:16:55,580
to experience a console war of its own. Nintendo had dominated the handheld market since as far

2143
03:16:55,580 --> 03:17:01,340
back as the original Game and Watch in 1980 and after the Game Boy beat out a number of rivals in

2144
03:17:01,340 --> 03:17:08,860
the early 90s, Nintendo spent years being virtually unopposed. Their reign continued in the early 2000s

2145
03:17:08,860 --> 03:17:16,140
with long-awaited Game Boy Advance, which released worldwide in 2001. The system still lacked a

2146
03:17:16,140 --> 03:17:22,460
backlit screen, a feature other handhelds had included as early as the Atari Lynx in 1989,

2147
03:17:23,020 --> 03:17:29,500
but otherwise it launched at an affordable $99 and compared to the now seriously dated Game Boy,

2148
03:17:29,500 --> 03:17:36,620
it provided a decent step up. The original Game Boy was technically inferior to the 8-bit NES,

2149
03:17:36,620 --> 03:17:42,220
whereas outside of the smaller screen resolution, the Game Boy Advance was technically superior

2150
03:17:42,220 --> 03:17:49,100
to the 16-bit Super Nintendo. This had clear benefits for games so long as you could see them

2151
03:17:49,100 --> 03:17:54,380
on the poorly illuminated screen that once more got to haunt a new generation of children.

2152
03:17:55,340 --> 03:18:01,500
Nintendo would follow the Game Boy Advance with the Advance SP two years later, which updated the

2153
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:08,940
model and finally included a light source. And now that Game Boy owners could at last see what games

2154
03:18:08,940 --> 03:18:14,140
they were actually playing, they were in for a treat because the Game Boy Advance had an extensive

2155
03:18:14,140 --> 03:18:20,060
library on top of backwards compatibility with the original Game Boy's cartridges. The system's

2156
03:18:20,060 --> 03:18:26,300
best-selling game was Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, its second best-selling game was Pokemon Fire Red

2157
03:18:26,300 --> 03:18:32,300
and Leaf Green, and its third best-selling game was Pokemon Emerald. But it had successful games

2158
03:18:32,300 --> 03:18:38,220
outside of Pokemon as well as all the Nintendo series you'd expect, with plenty of ports of

2159
03:18:38,220 --> 03:18:44,620
Super Nintendo classics. One thing it didn't have was an original Mario title of its own,

2160
03:18:44,620 --> 03:18:50,220
but without any competition that hardly mattered, and the Game Boy Advance and Advance SP were

2161
03:18:50,220 --> 03:18:57,340
highly successful, with sales of over 81 million units. Still, Nintendo's era of free reign wouldn't

2162
03:18:57,340 --> 03:19:04,460
last forever, and at E3 2003 it was reeled that they would face new competition from the same

2163
03:19:04,460 --> 03:19:10,300
company who had just beaten them twice in the home console market. PlayStation Portable will allow

2164
03:19:10,300 --> 03:19:16,940
consumers to enjoy 3D gaming similar to the experience delivered on PlayStation 2. It also

2165
03:19:16,940 --> 03:19:22,780
has the ability to deliver high-quality movies, music, and video as well as other forms of digital

2166
03:19:22,780 --> 03:19:29,660
entertainment content through one central device. And all of this is made possible through cutting

2167
03:19:29,660 --> 03:19:37,740
edge technologies aimed at helping us explore the future in new ways. Sony had dabbled in the handheld

2168
03:19:37,820 --> 03:19:43,260
space already with the Pocket Station, a portable add-on for the PlayStation 1 that released in

2169
03:19:43,260 --> 03:19:50,780
1999 exclusively in Japan. Their next attempt would be rather more ambitious, and the announcement

2170
03:19:50,780 --> 03:19:56,460
showed off some impressively powerful technical specifications alongside a heavy focus on multimedia

2171
03:19:56,460 --> 03:20:05,500
support, with movies, music, and online web browsing. Sony's plan was simple, do for handhelds

2172
03:20:05,500 --> 03:20:11,340
what they did for consoles through following the same approach, i.e. good hardware, disk-based

2173
03:20:11,340 --> 03:20:19,260
operating, functionality outside of games, and strong third-party support. And, as for that hardware,

2174
03:20:19,260 --> 03:20:25,820
Sony were keen to highlight just how similar it was to the still mid-cycle PlayStation 2,

2175
03:20:25,820 --> 03:20:30,860
at a time when Nintendo's current handheld was only on the level of a two-generations-old

2176
03:20:30,860 --> 03:20:37,020
Super Nintendo, and their next handheld was being developed in line with the last gen N64.

2177
03:20:38,300 --> 03:20:44,140
Basically, Sony was planning to skip ahead and deliver a product a whole generation more advanced

2178
03:20:44,140 --> 03:20:51,980
than their rival. For Nintendo, however, power wasn't the main priority. The idea for their next

2179
03:20:51,980 --> 03:20:59,820
system came from Hiroshi Yamauchi, a man who served as Nintendo president for an incredible 53 years.

2180
03:21:00,860 --> 03:21:05,740
The dual screens were similar to certain models of the game and watch, and Nintendo wanted to use

2181
03:21:05,740 --> 03:21:10,620
their new system as a chance to innovate and move away from the conservative image that they were

2182
03:21:10,620 --> 03:21:16,860
worried they'd started to develop. Nintendo were still taking the handheld market seriously, though.

2183
03:21:16,860 --> 03:21:21,740
In fact, after the mediocre sales of the GameCube, the next generation of handhelds came to be seen

2184
03:21:21,740 --> 03:21:27,260
as more important than ever, with President Yamauchi famously saying that if the new system

2185
03:21:27,340 --> 03:21:32,380
succeeds, we will rise to heaven, but if it fails, we will sink to hell.

2186
03:21:33,660 --> 03:21:39,740
And so, Sony's PlayStation Portable and Nintendo's DS went head-to-head.

2187
03:21:40,780 --> 03:21:44,860
Both systems launched at a similar time in Japan in 2004,

2188
03:21:44,860 --> 03:21:50,780
although the DS had a four-to-five-month head start in other regions. The DS also had a lower

2189
03:21:50,780 --> 03:21:58,940
retail price of $150 to the PSP's $250. Meanwhile, the PSP had a clear advantage in hardware,

2190
03:21:58,940 --> 03:22:05,420
with a larger display, higher resolution, and a much more powerful CPU. This translated to far

2191
03:22:05,420 --> 03:22:11,340
better graphics, with the PSP succeeding at coming close to PS2 level, minus the smaller

2192
03:22:11,340 --> 03:22:18,060
resolution, whereas the DS was still clearly one generation behind. Nintendo's new system

2193
03:22:18,060 --> 03:22:22,780
did come with a touchscreen, however, and this was several years before the arrival of smartphones,

2194
03:22:23,340 --> 03:22:29,420
meaning few people had seen this technology before. The combination of two screens and

2195
03:22:29,420 --> 03:22:35,740
touch-based controls did make the DS stand out, but it wasn't initially clear to prospective buyers

2196
03:22:35,740 --> 03:22:39,420
just how big an impact this would have on their gaming experiences.

2197
03:22:40,620 --> 03:22:46,140
And so, as both systems launched, the PSP was the one generating the most hype,

2198
03:22:46,220 --> 03:22:51,100
with reviewers impressed by the system's power and with Sony riding high off the momentum

2199
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:57,340
of two record-breaking home consoles. In Japan, both systems got off to strong starts,

2200
03:22:57,340 --> 03:23:02,540
with the PSP selling out faster, but the DS selling more units due to greater supply.

2201
03:23:03,820 --> 03:23:08,860
In America, the PSP released later and performed below Sony's expectations,

2202
03:23:08,860 --> 03:23:14,540
while the DS surpassed Nintendo's. Europe saw more or less the opposite though,

2203
03:23:14,620 --> 03:23:19,500
as while the PSP again arrived late, this time it sold out at record speeds,

2204
03:23:19,500 --> 03:23:25,260
quickly surpassing the earlier numbers of the DS. And so, in their first year,

2205
03:23:25,260 --> 03:23:30,540
the two systems seemed to be neck and neck, and attention then turned to the games.

2206
03:23:31,580 --> 03:23:35,980
In the console market, Sony had always excelled at attracting third parties,

2207
03:23:35,980 --> 03:23:41,100
but when it came to handhelds, they were still a newcomer, whereas Nintendo had been working

2208
03:23:41,100 --> 03:23:47,340
with third parties on handheld games for many years. As a result, both systems received plenty

2209
03:23:47,340 --> 03:23:54,380
of third-party support, but Sony no longer had the clear advantage. The PSP looked to continue

2210
03:23:54,380 --> 03:23:59,020
the success of its less portable cousins through continuations of many of Sony's best-selling

2211
03:23:59,020 --> 03:24:05,740
series. Its biggest success would be Grand 5th Auto Liberty City Stories, and this would be followed

2212
03:24:05,740 --> 03:24:11,020
by a spin-off to Jack and Daxter, a new Tekken title with Dark Resurrection, a second Grand 5th

2213
03:24:11,020 --> 03:24:16,540
Auto with Vice City Stories, multiple Metal Gear Solid titles with tactical card game Metal Gear

2214
03:24:16,540 --> 03:24:22,460
Acid, and the more traditional Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops, and a new Ratchet and Clank game

2215
03:24:22,460 --> 03:24:28,300
in Size Matters. Later releases would see new entries into the Final Fantasy series with Crisis

2216
03:24:28,300 --> 03:24:34,300
Core and Decidia, a Kingdom Hearts prequel with Birth by Sleep, entries into the Gran Turismo and

2217
03:24:34,300 --> 03:24:40,140
God of War series, and several games from Capcom's new Monster Hunter series, which proved hugely

2218
03:24:40,140 --> 03:24:46,220
popular in Japan. The PSP was further helped by the addition of a miniature analog stick,

2219
03:24:46,220 --> 03:24:51,420
which was a feature the DS didn't have, which helped the PSP's reputation as a more serious

2220
03:24:51,420 --> 03:24:58,060
gaming system. Meanwhile, over on the DS, there would also be continuations of popular series,

2221
03:24:58,060 --> 03:25:04,140
with the first new 2D Mario since the Super Nintendo in New Super Mario Bros,

2222
03:25:04,140 --> 03:25:11,980
as well as Mario Kart DS, a port of Super Mario 64, Animal Crossing Wildwood, Mario Party DS,

2223
03:25:11,980 --> 03:25:18,380
and for Legend of Zelda, Phantom Hourglass. However, alongside these more familiar names,

2224
03:25:18,380 --> 03:25:23,020
the DS would also find success with several new series that were deliberately designed around

2225
03:25:23,020 --> 03:25:28,860
the system's touchscreen. One of the most popular of these was Petsim, Nintendogs,

2226
03:25:28,860 --> 03:25:35,180
which released early on and quickly became a big hit. But amongst the DS's best-selling games

2227
03:25:35,180 --> 03:25:40,140
were a number of other names that didn't seem to resemble the usual gaming topsellers.

2228
03:25:41,260 --> 03:25:48,380
These included Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, Professor Kakayama's Maths Training,

2229
03:25:48,380 --> 03:25:55,260
the 100 Cell Calculation Method, Big Brain Academy, Flash Focus Vision Training in Minutes a Day,

2230
03:25:55,820 --> 03:26:03,260
and English Training Have Fun Improving Your Skills. If you want to know just what a big deal

2231
03:26:03,260 --> 03:26:08,940
Brain Age Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day was, all you need to know is that it sold more copies

2232
03:26:08,940 --> 03:26:16,300
than any Pokemon game released on the DS. The game was inspired by a popular Japanese book,

2233
03:26:16,300 --> 03:26:22,780
Train Your Brain 60 Days to a Better Brain, and after a new president of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata,

2234
03:26:22,780 --> 03:26:27,260
met with the author, a decision was made to implement the book's thesis in a new game

2235
03:26:27,260 --> 03:26:33,020
for Nintendo's upcoming handheld that they hoped might appeal to casual gamers. And it did.

2236
03:26:34,060 --> 03:26:38,860
Nintendo released a number of semi-educational puzzle games over the DS's lifespan,

2237
03:26:38,860 --> 03:26:42,300
and this became a major contributor to the success of its software sales.

2238
03:26:42,300 --> 03:26:48,300
Sony targeted core gamers by doing something similar to its existing consoles and found

2239
03:26:48,300 --> 03:26:54,140
success with the teenage and young adult markets, but Nintendo found considerable success with both

2240
03:26:54,140 --> 03:26:59,660
younger and older demographics, including people who may not traditionally have had much experience

2241
03:26:59,660 --> 03:27:05,660
with gaming. And so, just like with the design of their system, both companies had radically

2242
03:27:05,660 --> 03:27:11,740
different approaches with their gaming lineups, and with time, one started to perform better than

2243
03:27:11,740 --> 03:27:17,740
the other. The DS saw consistently stronger software sales and was able to maintain its

2244
03:27:17,740 --> 03:27:24,300
momentum through a number of redesigns, starting with the DS Lite in 2006, then the DSi in early

2245
03:27:24,300 --> 03:27:32,140
2009, and lastly with the DSi XO one year later. These redesigns weren't universally applauded,

2246
03:27:32,140 --> 03:27:36,940
with the DSi's removal of backwards compatibility with Game Boy games and its introduction of

2247
03:27:36,940 --> 03:27:42,220
digital cameras being seen as questionable, but the DS Lite in particular helped the console

2248
03:27:42,220 --> 03:27:49,900
maintain sales. Meanwhile, the PSP also saw hardware updates with the PSP 2000 and 3000

2249
03:27:49,900 --> 03:27:56,060
reducing the size and improving the screen, and the later PSP Go, providing a total model redesign

2250
03:27:56,060 --> 03:28:01,660
alongside a move to digital only. Still, the Go retained the system's high price,

2251
03:28:01,660 --> 03:28:06,940
and over time, interest in the PSP dwindled, while the DS pulled further and further ahead.

2252
03:28:08,300 --> 03:28:13,020
This might be because while the PSP came close to matching the PS2's best titles in terms of

2253
03:28:13,020 --> 03:28:17,660
graphics, its game still felt consistently inferior to their console inspirations.

2254
03:28:18,780 --> 03:28:23,740
Early Metal Gear titles in particular seemed to mark a dropping quality, but even the PSP's

2255
03:28:23,740 --> 03:28:28,060
best-selling Grand Theft Auto titles were still widely considered to be worse than the games

2256
03:28:28,060 --> 03:28:34,060
which inspired them. Then, as the next generation of consoles arrived with high-definition graphics,

2257
03:28:34,060 --> 03:28:39,580
the PSP's visuals were no longer quite so impressive, and with neither graphical prowess

2258
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:44,860
or must-have games to sell the system, and competition from newly arriving smartphones

2259
03:28:44,860 --> 03:28:49,260
diminishing the PSP's role as a multimedia device, the system was left struggling.

2260
03:28:50,540 --> 03:28:57,260
Meanwhile, the DS was different in both gameplay experiences and audience, and so it was able to

2261
03:28:57,260 --> 03:29:02,940
maintain its more unique place within the gaming market over time. In the end, the Nintendo DS

2262
03:29:02,940 --> 03:29:09,420
sold over 154 million units, making it the best-selling handheld and second best-selling

2263
03:29:09,420 --> 03:29:15,980
system in history, only behind the PlayStation 2. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portable sold

2264
03:29:15,980 --> 03:29:21,980
around 18 million units, making it an impressive debut by Sony even if it still ultimately fell

2265
03:29:21,980 --> 03:29:28,140
well behind its competition. For handhelds overall, however, this may have been the greatest

2266
03:29:28,140 --> 03:29:34,540
generation in gaming history, with record numbers of titles, genuine innovation from Nintendo,

2267
03:29:34,540 --> 03:29:40,460
impressive power from Sony, and overall sales figures far beyond anything which came before

2268
03:29:40,460 --> 03:29:47,020
or after. By the end of the decade, smartphones were well on their way, bringing the new frontier

2269
03:29:47,020 --> 03:29:51,740
of mobile gaming with them and creating fresh competition for dedicated handheld systems.

2270
03:29:52,780 --> 03:29:58,780
Still, for a while, the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable put handhelds on top of the gaming world,

2271
03:29:59,420 --> 03:30:04,940
and with two very different systems to choose from, consumers were arguably the biggest winners

2272
03:30:04,940 --> 03:30:11,580
of gaming's miniature console war. Nothing lasts forever though, and the arrival of mobile gaming

2273
03:30:11,580 --> 03:30:17,020
would come to mark the beginning of the end for handhelds, and this wasn't the only part of the

2274
03:30:17,020 --> 03:30:28,540
industry where things were changing. For many years, PC gaming had been a place of new innovations

2275
03:30:28,540 --> 03:30:34,380
and independent development, but by the start of the 21st century, the divide between PC gaming

2276
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:41,100
and consoles wasn't quite so clear anymore. The PlayStation 1's use of PC-based development kits

2277
03:30:41,100 --> 03:30:46,940
made porting between computers and consoles easier than ever, and as a result, many PC developers

2278
03:30:46,940 --> 03:30:52,380
started to bring their games to consoles as well. This trend continued into the next generation,

2279
03:30:52,380 --> 03:30:56,780
as all major console players now took the importance of porting and cross-platform games

2280
03:30:56,780 --> 03:31:02,380
into consideration. At the same time, the console market had seen rapid growth since the launch

2281
03:31:02,380 --> 03:31:08,060
of the PlayStation 1, making it a more lucrative market than ever, and then Microsoft entered

2282
03:31:08,060 --> 03:31:13,740
the console space as well, making PC gaming and consoles even more closely connected.

2283
03:31:14,940 --> 03:31:20,700
The result of all this was that PC gaming wasn't really as important in the 2000s as it was in

2284
03:31:20,700 --> 03:31:25,740
the previous decades, and several notable PC developers started to design their games with

2285
03:31:25,740 --> 03:31:33,340
consoles in mind, and maybe even as a priority. One of the best examples of this is Bioware,

2286
03:31:33,420 --> 03:31:38,060
whose Baldur's Gate series had helped define the computer role-playing genre in the late 90s.

2287
03:31:38,940 --> 03:31:44,940
Then, after another PC-focused RPG in Neverwinter Night since 2002, they made Star Wars Knights of

2288
03:31:44,940 --> 03:31:51,020
the Old Republic for PC and Xbox, a game with a more console-focused design than earlier titles,

2289
03:31:51,020 --> 03:31:57,500
and then their next two games, Jade Empire and Mass Effect, continued the console-focused design

2290
03:31:57,500 --> 03:32:03,820
and released exclusively on Xbox and Xbox 360, while only later coming to PC.

2291
03:32:05,260 --> 03:32:10,860
And so, while PC games did continue to release in this period, for developers, this was a time

2292
03:32:10,860 --> 03:32:17,980
when consoles were often more important. The 2000s would also see certain classic PC gaming

2293
03:32:17,980 --> 03:32:22,860
genres start to fall out of fashion, either because of changing consumer interests,

2294
03:32:22,940 --> 03:32:27,980
or changing trends in game design, or just the impact of console growth over PC.

2295
03:32:29,260 --> 03:32:35,020
Examples include point-and-click adventure games, dungeon crawlers, turn-based RPGs,

2296
03:32:35,020 --> 03:32:39,820
arena shooters, certain simulation games, and even real-time strategy games.

2297
03:32:41,020 --> 03:32:46,700
Some series that did see substantial PC success this decade include the already mentioned Sims,

2298
03:32:46,700 --> 03:32:53,740
which received sequels in 2004 and 2009, the Total War series, which started with Shogun Total War

2299
03:32:53,740 --> 03:33:00,060
in 2000 and received four more sequels over the next ten years, and the Civilization series,

2300
03:33:00,060 --> 03:33:06,860
which saw its third entry in 2001 with further sequels in 2005 and 2010.

2301
03:33:08,220 --> 03:33:14,060
Perhaps the PC's most standout release in this period was Valve's Half-Life 2 in 2004.

2302
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:19,260
Built on the studio's brand new source engine, its graphics alone were a whole generation ahead

2303
03:33:19,260 --> 03:33:24,300
of anything on console at the time, and when combined with the engine's advanced new physics

2304
03:33:24,300 --> 03:33:29,500
simulation, the game offered one of the most realistic and immersive experiences anyone had

2305
03:33:29,500 --> 03:33:35,900
ever seen. Still, Half-Life 2 was more than just the graphical showcase. It used its new

2306
03:33:35,900 --> 03:33:40,620
higher level of detail to craft effective environmental storytelling. Its physics were

2307
03:33:41,580 --> 03:33:45,420
incorporated into puzzle design and allowed for the addition of a new gravity gun,

2308
03:33:45,980 --> 03:33:51,420
and it combined varied gameplay, evocative worldbuilding, and an immersive, seamless story

2309
03:33:51,420 --> 03:33:55,740
to create one of the most enduring single-player FPS experiences of all time.

2310
03:33:56,940 --> 03:34:01,020
Half-Life 2 is one of the most highly acclaimed games of the 21st century,

2311
03:34:01,020 --> 03:34:07,820
and it sold over 12 million copies. At a time when big PC exclusives seemed to be dying out,

2312
03:34:07,900 --> 03:34:12,140
Half-Life 2 was a game which came to symbolize the system and its player base,

2313
03:34:13,180 --> 03:34:16,460
even if it did still release on consoles a few years later.

2314
03:34:17,580 --> 03:34:23,020
Still, even if the PC might have been past its golden age, there was one area where it continued

2315
03:34:23,020 --> 03:34:27,580
to innovate, and it was an area which was only growing in importance.

2316
03:34:28,940 --> 03:34:33,660
Online Online gaming may have started in the 90s,

2317
03:34:33,660 --> 03:34:39,580
but the 2000s was when it exploded. The biggest contributor to this was the adoption of Broadband.

2318
03:34:40,300 --> 03:34:46,940
In 2000, only 3% of American homes had Broadband, but by 2010, that number had increased to 66%,

2319
03:34:47,820 --> 03:34:55,180
and Broadband meant convenient, high-speed internet access, which was perfect for playing online games.

2320
03:34:55,420 --> 03:35:03,100
In 2001, Dynamix's Tribes 2 upped the scale of online shooters to a staggering 128 players

2321
03:35:03,100 --> 03:35:11,260
in fast-paced jetpack-fuelled action. In 2002, EA's Battlefield 1942 offered a rather different

2322
03:35:11,260 --> 03:35:16,860
kind of large-scale multiplayer warfare with up to 64 players in an impressive simulation

2323
03:35:16,860 --> 03:35:24,300
of a realistic battle. Alongside EA's Medal of Honor and Activision's Call of Duty in 2003,

2324
03:35:25,020 --> 03:35:29,180
these three series established the modern military shooter, something that would play a

2325
03:35:29,180 --> 03:35:35,340
massive part in the gaming industry for years to come. In 2004, Valve released Counter-Strike

2326
03:35:35,340 --> 03:35:40,940
Source, ensuring the popular round-based shooter continued to stay relevant, and in 2007,

2327
03:35:40,940 --> 03:35:46,380
Valve released Team Fortress 2, a class and objective-based FPS that has continued to

2328
03:35:46,380 --> 03:35:52,140
remain active and popular to this day. Online shooters were making their way to consoles

2329
03:35:52,140 --> 03:35:57,900
as early as Unreal Championship in 2002, but for many people, PC was still the best place to

2330
03:35:57,900 --> 03:36:04,060
experience them, with custom matchmaking, dedicated servers, and loyal communities all shaping an

2331
03:36:04,060 --> 03:36:10,300
experience unlike the one on the more tightly controlled consoles. But online gaming wasn't

2332
03:36:10,300 --> 03:36:15,420
just about shooting other people. One of the biggest trends of the decade was the growth of

2333
03:36:15,420 --> 03:36:22,940
massively multiplayer online RPGs, with games like Dark Age of Camelot, RuneScape, Ragnarok Online,

2334
03:36:22,940 --> 03:36:27,980
Final Fantasy XI, and Star Wars Galaxies all following on from what Ultima Online and EverQuest

2335
03:36:27,980 --> 03:36:34,220
started in the late 90s. Still, when it came to MMOs, there was one game which reigned supreme

2336
03:36:34,220 --> 03:36:41,660
over all others. Released in late 2004, World of Warcraft took Blizzard's popular fantasy series

2337
03:36:41,660 --> 03:36:48,700
online in a massive way. With a staggeringly large open world, distinct factions, classes,

2338
03:36:48,700 --> 03:36:54,140
and races, and more attention than previous MMOs to accessibility and leveling, World of Warcraft

2339
03:36:54,140 --> 03:37:00,780
quickly became hugely popular. By 2010, it was well into its second expansion and had over 12

2340
03:37:00,780 --> 03:37:07,580
million concurrent subscribers, all paying monthly fees. In a time before microtransactions,

2341
03:37:07,660 --> 03:37:13,500
loot boxes, or DLC, this represented a serious amount of continuous income on a scale which

2342
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:20,140
the gaming industry had never really seen before. 12 million players also meant a serious amount of

2343
03:37:20,140 --> 03:37:26,540
time was being invested into Warcraft's virtual world. As more and more players followed, the

2344
03:37:26,540 --> 03:37:32,780
reputation of a genre as something life-consuming, addictive, and dangerous grew as those outside

2345
03:37:32,780 --> 03:37:38,700
the gaming community tried to make sense of this new, growing phenomenon. In reality, some of the

2346
03:37:38,700 --> 03:37:44,460
panic this led to was overblown, but there was an element of truth to it as well. For some people,

2347
03:37:44,460 --> 03:37:51,020
MMOs really were addictive. The escapist promised of another world to lose yourself in, the competitive

2348
03:37:51,020 --> 03:37:55,580
nature of player-vs-player combat and end-game raiding, and the social bonds that come from

2349
03:37:55,580 --> 03:38:00,460
spending so much time with other players in a shared world all contributed to an experience

2350
03:38:00,460 --> 03:38:06,380
still new to many people that could provide hours of fun, but could also be hard to turn away from.

2351
03:38:08,140 --> 03:38:13,340
World of Warcraft would be followed by many other MMOs, most of which took heavy inspiration from its

2352
03:38:13,340 --> 03:38:19,020
success, but in the end, the genre's growth didn't last, and rather than going on to conquer the

2353
03:38:19,020 --> 03:38:24,620
entire gaming world, the genre instead seemed to peak at the decade's end as more and more online

2354
03:38:24,620 --> 03:38:30,300
games started to emerge. For a time, however, World of Warcraft really did stand at the top of the

2355
03:38:30,300 --> 03:38:37,180
gaming world, and it became an important part of 2000's gaming culture in the process. Still,

2356
03:38:37,180 --> 03:38:42,380
while World of Warcraft might have been the biggest online game of the 2000s, it certainly wasn't the

2357
03:38:42,380 --> 03:38:48,300
only one that left a lasting mark on the industry, and in fact, it wasn't even the only one to come

2358
03:38:48,300 --> 03:38:56,220
from the Warcraft series. Warcraft 3 released in 2002, and was an important online game in its

2359
03:38:56,220 --> 03:39:00,780
own right, with an active modding and competitive scene that were aided by the game's inclusion

2360
03:39:00,780 --> 03:39:06,540
of a world editor. This allowed players to create custom scenarios or maps for the game,

2361
03:39:06,540 --> 03:39:12,220
and many of these found popularity online, but one map in particular would go a whole lot further.

2362
03:39:13,180 --> 03:39:17,820
Defense of the Ancients took inspiration from an earlier custom map in Starcraft,

2363
03:39:17,820 --> 03:39:23,100
and shifted Warcraft's more traditional RTS focus towards hero vs hero action.

2364
03:39:24,380 --> 03:39:29,500
Dota proved to be a big hit, and would continue to get updated over the course of the decade,

2365
03:39:29,500 --> 03:39:34,460
with a dedicated community being built around its competitive play, which soon started appearing

2366
03:39:34,460 --> 03:39:40,380
at esport events. By the end of the decade, Dota was starting to attract serious commercial

2367
03:39:40,460 --> 03:39:47,100
attention, and in 2009, one of its original developers, alongside the recently formed Riot Games,

2368
03:39:47,100 --> 03:39:52,940
would launch their own take on a standalone Dota-like experience called League of Legends.

2369
03:39:54,220 --> 03:39:59,980
In time, the genre's name would change from Dota-like to MOBA, or Multiplayer Online Battle

2370
03:39:59,980 --> 03:40:05,580
Arena, and in a little more time, this would become one of the most popular genres in the world.

2371
03:40:06,540 --> 03:40:14,140
And it all started with a single custom map for Warcraft 3. Counter-Strike and Team Fortress

2372
03:40:14,140 --> 03:40:19,180
were also games which started life as player-created mods, and between them, they proved that the

2373
03:40:19,180 --> 03:40:24,460
innovative and independent side of PC gaming, where developers could change the entire industry with

2374
03:40:24,460 --> 03:40:31,260
a few lines of code written in their bedroom, was still alive, even in the console-dominated 2000s.

2375
03:40:32,220 --> 03:40:38,540
And speaking of console domination, the mid-2000s also brought the arrival of a new generation

2376
03:40:38,540 --> 03:40:43,020
alongside the greatest fall from grace since the collapse of Atari.

2377
03:40:48,780 --> 03:40:53,260
With the PlayStation 2, Sony achieved the unthinkable, and they were set to enter the

2378
03:40:53,260 --> 03:40:58,940
7th generation of consoles with a huge lead in market share and a near flawless reputation

2379
03:40:59,180 --> 03:41:04,780
with the public. One year after the release of their next system, however, they would find

2380
03:41:04,780 --> 03:41:10,700
themselves firmly in last place in sales while making a significant loss on each unit sold,

2381
03:41:10,700 --> 03:41:14,780
with onlookers questioning if they were witnessing the beginning of the end

2382
03:41:14,780 --> 03:41:21,740
of the once-immortal PlayStation. For 10 years, Sony dominated the console market

2383
03:41:21,740 --> 03:41:27,100
without any competitor coming close. For 10 years, they looked unbeatable.

2384
03:41:28,140 --> 03:41:30,860
Until, suddenly, things changed.

2385
03:41:32,780 --> 03:41:39,980
The story of how this happened began at E3 2005. For years, gamers the world over had been

2386
03:41:39,980 --> 03:41:44,380
eagerly awaiting the next generation of gaming, and it was here that they were finally going to

2387
03:41:44,380 --> 03:41:50,460
get to see it, with Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo showing off their new consoles officially for the

2388
03:41:50,460 --> 03:41:57,500
very first time. For Nintendo, the reveal was still rather secretive. The console was named

2389
03:41:57,500 --> 03:42:01,900
The Revolution, due to Nintendo's belief that it would revolutionize the industry,

2390
03:42:01,900 --> 03:42:07,180
but the reason for that revolution wasn't yet made clear, and other than a look at the prototype

2391
03:42:07,180 --> 03:42:11,900
model, some technical details, and a brief showing of some next-generation Metroid,

2392
03:42:11,900 --> 03:42:15,100
the audience was ultimately left with more questions than answers.

2393
03:42:15,500 --> 03:42:22,540
For Microsoft, the event meant details. The already-announced Xbox 360 was set to launch

2394
03:42:22,540 --> 03:42:27,020
later that year ahead of its competition, and Microsoft showed off upcoming games,

2395
03:42:27,020 --> 03:42:31,820
provided technical specifications, and emphasized the new online interconnectivity,

2396
03:42:31,820 --> 03:42:36,460
with in-game messaging, downloadable games, and further online support being planned.

2397
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:43,260
Sony, however, wasn't as close to their console's release date, and so the event came to be about

2398
03:42:43,500 --> 03:42:51,260
the future. Sony's main announcement was the Cell multi-core microprocessor that would be powering

2399
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:57,900
their new upcoming system. This was being built in collaboration with IBM and Toshiba, and used

2400
03:42:57,900 --> 03:43:03,340
genuine supercomputer technology, making it a promising piece of hardware that could put Sony's

2401
03:43:03,340 --> 03:43:09,820
system a clear step above its competition in terms of pure power. Sony spent far longer showcasing

2402
03:43:09,820 --> 03:43:15,420
the Cell processor than any company would normally spend on such a subject, with both tech demos

2403
03:43:15,420 --> 03:43:22,540
and games designed to show off its capabilities. Some of what was shown was genuinely mind-blowing.

2404
03:43:23,340 --> 03:43:27,740
It can be hard to tell on lower-resolution video footage after years of further technological

2405
03:43:27,740 --> 03:43:33,980
advances, but for the time, the quality of certain games was far beyond anything people had seen

2406
03:43:33,980 --> 03:43:40,700
before, beyond Microsoft's recent 360 showcase, and beyond what many people thought was even possible.

2407
03:43:41,900 --> 03:43:46,860
For example, Killzone featured animations, physics, and lighting effects that are still

2408
03:43:46,860 --> 03:43:53,020
difficult to achieve today, 18 years later, including explosions casting shadows in real time.

2409
03:43:54,220 --> 03:43:59,020
For people who knew a little about gaming hardware, this could only mean one of two

2410
03:43:59,020 --> 03:44:03,580
possibilities, and arguments were quick to break out online about which one was true.

2411
03:44:04,780 --> 03:44:09,340
Either Sony was about to obliterate the competition and dominate a third console

2412
03:44:09,340 --> 03:44:16,300
generation in a row with their far superior system, or the games shown were fake,

2413
03:44:17,580 --> 03:44:23,340
i.e pre-rendered videos that were only posing as games, or at best actual games that were

2414
03:44:23,340 --> 03:44:30,620
instead running on top-of-the-line PC hardware. In the end, time would tell, but not before the

2415
03:44:30,620 --> 03:44:41,500
Xbox 360 launched. The 360 released in November 2005 at $299 or $399, depending on model,

2416
03:44:41,500 --> 03:44:47,740
and it received a positive critical reception. Sales started strong, but manufacturing problems

2417
03:44:47,740 --> 03:44:52,860
limited supply, leading to the system selling out in all regions except Japan, while not

2418
03:44:52,860 --> 03:44:58,780
selling as many units as was originally hoped. The launch lineup was nothing remarkable,

2419
03:44:58,780 --> 03:45:04,140
with Call of Duty 2 and Perfect Dark Zero being the best selling titles, yet Niber represented

2420
03:45:04,140 --> 03:45:11,100
a true system seller. And so, with one console released, the field was wide open, with everything

2421
03:45:11,100 --> 03:45:18,220
still to play for. 2006 saw the PlayStation 3 being delayed from its earlier release date of spring

2422
03:45:18,220 --> 03:45:24,060
to later in the year, while the 360 continued strong, adding more exclusive games to its library,

2423
03:45:24,060 --> 03:45:29,900
including the Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion, Dead Rising, and Saints Row. Meanwhile,

2424
03:45:29,900 --> 03:45:36,620
E3 that year brought Nintendo's big reveal, and reactions were mixed. The new name, The We,

2425
03:45:36,620 --> 03:45:41,980
was widely mocked, and the showcasing of the new motion controls left audiences uncertain.

2426
03:45:42,940 --> 03:45:48,140
For Nintendo and the gaming industry, this was a bold new direction, and no one seemed quite

2427
03:45:48,140 --> 03:45:54,300
sure yet what the impact of this would be. One thing it did make clear, however, was that Nintendo

2428
03:45:54,300 --> 03:45:58,460
wouldn't be in the competition for the most powerful next-gen system anymore, and would

2429
03:45:58,460 --> 03:46:06,220
instead be finding success or failure through forging their own path. And so, attention returned to

2430
03:46:06,220 --> 03:46:11,020
Sony, who were about to have a conference that would live in infamy ever since.

2431
03:46:11,820 --> 03:46:15,820
Our development teams all around the world, in all of our studios,

2432
03:46:15,820 --> 03:46:21,100
have been hard at work converting that technology and vision into magic.

2433
03:46:25,580 --> 03:46:31,820
Whoops. Another exciting aspect is the ability for consumers to make microtransactions, 599 US

2434
03:46:31,820 --> 03:46:36,220
dollars, and we've been digging deeper and discovering what kind of muscle this machine really has.

2435
03:46:39,420 --> 03:46:43,500
And you can see from all of the games that we have up and running on PlayStation 3 that we're

2436
03:46:43,500 --> 03:46:50,940
really starting to push what this machine is capable of. Real-time weapon change, it's exhilarating.

2437
03:46:53,820 --> 03:46:57,340
What they're creating for the PlayStation 3 is inspiring.

2438
03:47:00,300 --> 03:47:07,660
So, that sums up our playable section. When E3 began in the 90s, it was something

2439
03:47:07,660 --> 03:47:12,540
aimed primarily at investors and industry professionals, and it came alongside boring

2440
03:47:12,540 --> 03:47:19,260
PowerPoint presentations full of sales figures and bar charts. As time went by, E3 became more and

2441
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:24,620
more about media coverage and consumer outreach, with it becoming the number one place to make

2442
03:47:24,620 --> 03:47:32,460
gaming announcements, while also drawing heavy consumer scrutiny. By 2006, E3 was starting to

2443
03:47:32,460 --> 03:47:37,820
attract more consumer attention, and Sony's presentation wasn't exactly convincing.

2444
03:47:38,700 --> 03:47:43,900
Making fun of E3 conferences has gone on to become a recurring part of online gaming culture,

2445
03:47:44,540 --> 03:47:47,260
but this was where that tradition started.

2446
03:47:47,820 --> 03:47:49,660
And we're certainly not interested in gimmicks.

2447
03:47:49,660 --> 03:47:57,260
So, you can position this next to your TV screen and see for yourself what is coming up behind you.

2448
03:47:57,260 --> 03:47:59,580
And we're certainly not interested in conventional thinking.

2449
03:48:00,540 --> 03:48:06,860
Genji 2 is an ashen game, which is based on Japanese history. The stages of the game will

2450
03:48:06,860 --> 03:48:11,900
also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.

2451
03:48:13,580 --> 03:48:16,220
So, here's this giant enemy crab.

2452
03:48:16,220 --> 03:48:24,460
It's Ridge Racer. Ridge Racer. It requires huge financial investment, 599 US dollars,

2453
03:48:24,460 --> 03:48:28,060
but we must take risks to reap the rewards.

2454
03:48:28,060 --> 03:48:33,580
Still, as the dust settled, on-stage awkwardness and giant enemy crabs were the least of Sony's

2455
03:48:33,580 --> 03:48:40,860
worries. A retail price of 599 dollars, or 499 for a model with a smaller hard drive

2456
03:48:40,860 --> 03:48:46,780
and several missing features, was a staggering amount of money, well beyond the competition,

2457
03:48:46,780 --> 03:48:48,300
or what anyone expected.

2458
03:48:49,500 --> 03:48:54,060
The system would include a Blu-ray player, which helped Sony promote the Blu-ray format,

2459
03:48:54,060 --> 03:48:59,740
but unlike the DVD player of the PS2, for most consumers, this did little to make up for the

2460
03:48:59,740 --> 03:49:04,060
system's high price, as the Blu-ray format was still rarely being used at the time.

2461
03:49:05,180 --> 03:49:09,580
Sony, however, justified the high price on the basis that the power of their system

2462
03:49:09,580 --> 03:49:16,300
made it worth it. They were Sony, they made the best consoles, and the higher price was

2463
03:49:16,300 --> 03:49:21,980
reflective of their far more powerful hardware. Sony didn't see the problem with this logic,

2464
03:49:22,700 --> 03:49:24,060
but other people did.

2465
03:49:24,380 --> 03:49:29,820
Alongside the price, release date, and lessons on Japanese history, Sony also showcased several

2466
03:49:29,820 --> 03:49:34,780
upcoming games, yet most of them didn't look as impressive as what Sony had shown the year

2467
03:49:34,780 --> 03:49:39,500
before. What's more, they also didn't look especially different to the already released

2468
03:49:39,500 --> 03:49:46,060
games on the Xbox 360. Sony did have a more powerful system, but it seemed they didn't

2469
03:49:46,060 --> 03:49:52,060
have much to show for it. Of course, some people disagreed with arguments ranging online about

2470
03:49:53,020 --> 03:49:57,100
the console's graphics, and people possibly seeing whatever they wanted to see.

2471
03:49:58,380 --> 03:50:05,100
In the end, time would once more tell the true story, and in November 2006, the PlayStation 3

2472
03:50:05,100 --> 03:50:10,300
released in America and Japan, with a last-minute delay leading to the European release being

2473
03:50:10,300 --> 03:50:18,060
pushed to early 2007. Regardless of the price, the system did still sell, with stock shortages

2474
03:50:18,060 --> 03:50:24,220
and online scalpers causing controversy. The PS3 launch lineup also didn't have too much to offer,

2475
03:50:24,220 --> 03:50:28,460
and featured fewer games than the 360 had at release, with the best-selling game being

2476
03:50:28,460 --> 03:50:34,540
Resistance Full of Man. Still, by this point, the Xbox 360 had been out for a year already,

2477
03:50:34,540 --> 03:50:39,660
and in that time, its library had grown considerably, with the month of the PS3's launch

2478
03:50:39,660 --> 03:50:45,500
just happening to coincide with Microsoft's latest big exclusive, Gears of War, a third-person

2479
03:50:45,500 --> 03:50:51,980
shooter from Epic Games. Gears was a major critical and commercial hit. Its heavy focus on

2480
03:50:51,980 --> 03:50:56,780
cover-based combat was seen as a fresh take on the shooter genre, and it was the perfect game to

2481
03:50:56,780 --> 03:51:03,660
fill a space left open by the 360's absence of a new halo. What's more, its Unreal Engine-powered

2482
03:51:03,660 --> 03:51:09,740
graphics wowed critics and showcased what the 360 was capable of, and it seemed that what the 360

2483
03:51:09,740 --> 03:51:15,500
was capable of was keeping up with the supposedly more powerful PlayStation 3.

2484
03:51:16,940 --> 03:51:22,460
Of course, arguments about graphics still raged online, but by this point, for most people,

2485
03:51:22,460 --> 03:51:27,100
it was clear that if the PS3 did have an advantage, it wasn't a big enough one to win

2486
03:51:27,100 --> 03:51:33,420
them the console generation outright. At this point, you may be wondering what the hell was

2487
03:51:33,420 --> 03:51:39,260
going on inside the PlayStation 3, and whether the system even was more powerful to begin with,

2488
03:51:40,060 --> 03:51:43,660
and this was a question many people asked throughout the seventh generation.

2489
03:51:44,700 --> 03:51:50,700
The simple answer is that the cell processor famously used by the PS3 was more powerful,

2490
03:51:50,700 --> 03:51:56,300
but it was also more complicated, which made it harder for developers to actually utilize its power.

2491
03:51:57,500 --> 03:52:03,580
Meanwhile, the 360 had a solid CPU itself, while also having a small edge when it came to GPU power

2492
03:52:03,580 --> 03:52:09,260
and a more convenient shared memory system. In the end, though, any difference in power

2493
03:52:09,260 --> 03:52:13,260
didn't really matter. The key decider was third parties.

2494
03:52:14,620 --> 03:52:18,860
Sony hoped that they'd continue to lead the industry, and that developers would prioritize

2495
03:52:18,860 --> 03:52:25,260
developing for their more powerful system as a result. In reality, however, the Xbox 360 quickly

2496
03:52:25,260 --> 03:52:30,380
gained a sizable share of the market, and so developers' priority became making sure their

2497
03:52:30,380 --> 03:52:35,660
games were available on both systems, with some developers even going as far as to publicly

2498
03:52:35,660 --> 03:52:42,780
criticize Sony's more difficult to develop for hardware. But as the 360 was easier to develop

2499
03:52:42,780 --> 03:52:48,940
for, most multi-platform games were developed primarily for the Xbox 360 and then ported to the

2500
03:52:48,940 --> 03:52:55,500
PS3, meaning not only did the PlayStation 3 lack a graphical advantage, but in many multi-platform

2501
03:52:55,500 --> 03:53:03,180
games the PlayStation version either looked or ran worse. The PS3 did produce some great looking

2502
03:53:03,180 --> 03:53:08,060
exclusives, particularly later in its life once developers had more time to get used to the system's

2503
03:53:08,060 --> 03:53:13,580
architecture. But its reputation for having inferior versions of multi-platform games,

2504
03:53:13,580 --> 03:53:17,180
at a time when multi-platform games were becoming more important,

2505
03:53:17,180 --> 03:53:22,060
did damage the system's sales, with Microsoft often seeing much better software sales for

2506
03:53:22,060 --> 03:53:28,860
multi-platform titles. It also damaged Sony's brand, and without a graphical edge or many

2507
03:53:29,100 --> 03:53:35,340
exclusive games early in its life, the PlayStation 3 fell behind the 360, while the Xbox's library

2508
03:53:35,340 --> 03:53:41,980
continued to grow. 2007 brought more exclusives to Microsoft's system, including Crackdown,

2509
03:53:41,980 --> 03:53:48,780
Forza Motorsports 2, BioShock, and Mass Effect. The biggest of these, though, was the much

2510
03:53:48,780 --> 03:53:55,020
anticipated Halo 3, which promised players the chance to finish the fight in what was to be

2511
03:53:55,020 --> 03:54:01,980
Master Chief's final game. Halo was huge. It went on to sell over 14 million copies

2512
03:54:01,980 --> 03:54:06,140
in what many considered to be the best game of the 7th generation up until that point.

2513
03:54:07,260 --> 03:54:11,980
Sony would have some exclusives of their own that year, but the likes of a new Ratchet & Clank,

2514
03:54:11,980 --> 03:54:17,500
Uncharted Drake's Fortune, and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue weren't enough to match the 360's

2515
03:54:17,500 --> 03:54:22,620
superior offerings. What's more, many of the series that once made the PlayStation,

2516
03:54:22,620 --> 03:54:30,300
the console king, were going, or had already went, multi-platform. From Grand Theft Auto to Devil

2517
03:54:30,300 --> 03:54:36,220
May Cry, Tomb Raider, or Tekken, Sony's list of exclusives seemed to be getting smaller and smaller,

2518
03:54:36,220 --> 03:54:43,100
and at E3 2008, it was announced that even Final Fantasy, a series more important to Sony's early

2519
03:54:43,100 --> 03:54:49,900
success than any other, would be coming to both systems. Microsoft did face some of their own

2520
03:54:49,900 --> 03:54:55,580
problems, the most expensive being high rates of hardware failure, and the infamous Red Ring of

2521
03:54:55,580 --> 03:55:01,740
Death. Reports of technical problems appeared early in the 360's life, but the true extent of the

2522
03:55:01,740 --> 03:55:06,780
issue wasn't made apparent until a year or two after its launch, as more and more systems continued

2523
03:55:06,780 --> 03:55:13,100
to fail. In the end, Microsoft was forced to make an official response to the situation, alongside

2524
03:55:13,100 --> 03:55:20,540
offering all Xbox owners a full three-year warranty covering repairs and shipping. This was estimated

2525
03:55:20,540 --> 03:55:26,140
to cost over $1 billion, and slowed the Xbox's momentum at a time when Microsoft would have

2526
03:55:26,140 --> 03:55:32,540
loved to instead have been pulling further ahead. As the decade grew to a close, the PlayStation

2527
03:55:32,540 --> 03:55:39,740
3's outlook was finally starting to look more positive. Consecutive $100 price cuts in 2007,

2528
03:55:39,740 --> 03:55:48,380
2008, and 2009 finally brought the system to an affordable price. Several early 360 exclusives,

2529
03:55:48,380 --> 03:55:54,140
like the Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion and Bioshock, turned out to only have timed exclusivity and

2530
03:55:54,140 --> 03:55:59,420
made their way to Sony's system as well. And as the generation continued, the PlayStation 3 was

2531
03:55:59,420 --> 03:56:05,180
able to add more and more exclusives of its own, including LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid 4,

2532
03:56:05,740 --> 03:56:14,460
Killzone 2, Infamous, God of War 3, and Gran Turismo 5. Meanwhile, the exclusives on the 360

2533
03:56:14,460 --> 03:56:20,780
started to come slower, with highlights including Fable 2, Left 4 Dead, and sequels to Halo and

2534
03:56:20,780 --> 03:56:27,420
Gears of War. The decade would end with Microsoft still in the lead, but with Sony working hard to

2535
03:56:27,420 --> 03:56:32,540
make amends for their mistakes by taking heavy losses on systems sold after price cuts as they

2536
03:56:32,540 --> 03:56:37,660
tried to foster an image of appealing to core gamers and creating strong first-party titles.

2537
03:56:39,020 --> 03:56:44,620
Still, for Microsoft, the seventh generation can only be interpreted as victory, whereas for Sony,

2538
03:56:44,620 --> 03:56:50,060
they went from being untouchable to having to fight for their life. When Sony launched the

2539
03:56:50,060 --> 03:56:55,500
PlayStation 1, they found record success through the system's affordable price, its ease to develop

2540
03:56:55,500 --> 03:57:01,820
for, and its great third-party support that led to many exclusive titles. Ten years later,

2541
03:57:01,820 --> 03:57:06,380
they seem to have ignored all of these factors and were instead relying on name recognition to

2542
03:57:06,380 --> 03:57:11,340
sell their system no matter the price, and to bring developers to their side no matter the

2543
03:57:11,340 --> 03:57:17,340
challenge of development. Yet, while it might seem like Sony's downfall was brought about by

2544
03:57:17,340 --> 03:57:23,820
arrogance, it might be fairer to say that they were simply over-ambitious. The man responsible

2545
03:57:23,820 --> 03:57:29,740
for many of the decisions involving the PlayStation 3 was then Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO

2546
03:57:29,740 --> 03:57:36,300
Ken Kutaragi, who is sometimes described as the father of PlayStation. For Kutaragi,

2547
03:57:36,300 --> 03:57:40,780
this was to be his last direct involvement with Sony's gaming division, which was something he

2548
03:57:40,780 --> 03:57:47,260
had once done so much to help create, and he truly believed in the power of the cell processor and

2549
03:57:47,260 --> 03:57:53,740
had hopes its technology could be used in other Sony products. In the end, this wasn't to be,

2550
03:57:53,740 --> 03:57:59,260
but Kutaragi had taken gambles with the PlayStation 1 and 2 as well, and in the past,

2551
03:57:59,260 --> 03:58:02,940
this was a big part of what helped turn Sony into the leader of the industry.

2552
03:58:03,980 --> 03:58:09,900
This time, however, he simply got it wrong. Still, Sony weren't the only ones who took

2553
03:58:09,900 --> 03:58:15,740
a gamble in the 7th generation, and while the PS3 and 360 were in fierce competition for the

2554
03:58:15,740 --> 03:58:19,980
core gaming market, Nintendo were finding success elsewhere.

2555
03:58:20,940 --> 03:58:27,500
The Wii wasn't like its peers.

2556
03:58:28,540 --> 03:58:34,140
Where Sony and Microsoft moved to high definition, Nintendo's system remained at the 480p of the

2557
03:58:34,140 --> 03:58:38,940
previous generation, breaking the long-running convention of new consoles being more powerful

2558
03:58:38,940 --> 03:58:45,100
than their predecessors. Instead, Nintendo opted to avoid direct competition and to target a broader

2559
03:58:45,100 --> 03:58:51,660
demographic in what has sometimes been called the Blue Ocean business strategy, which asserts

2560
03:58:51,660 --> 03:58:58,140
finding value in less contested market spaces. To this end, Nintendo set out with the goal to

2561
03:58:58,140 --> 03:59:03,500
innovate, taking inspiration from the success of the Nintendo DS, as well as the popular arcade

2562
03:59:03,500 --> 03:59:08,460
rhythm game, Dance Dance Revolution, and new advancements in motion sensing technology.

2563
03:59:08,620 --> 03:59:14,860
The end result released in November 2006, mere days after the PlayStation 3.

2564
03:59:15,740 --> 03:59:23,020
Unlike the PS3, however, the Wii cost the mere $250, and it quickly sold out, beating the combined

2565
03:59:23,020 --> 03:59:27,740
sales of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in most regions during its launch.

2566
03:59:29,020 --> 03:59:34,300
The Wii offered something genuinely new, and people seemed eager to try it out for themselves.

2567
03:59:35,260 --> 03:59:41,100
By September 2007, the Wii had overtaken the 360, despite releasing a year later,

2568
03:59:41,100 --> 03:59:45,980
and it continued to sell well in 2010 when it started to experience a rapid decline

2569
03:59:45,980 --> 03:59:51,900
amidst increased competition. For many people though, the Wii was the perfect family console.

2570
03:59:52,860 --> 03:59:57,340
Its advertising targeted a wide audience, including mothers and grandmothers,

2571
03:59:57,340 --> 04:00:02,300
and its wealth of party games and simple pickup and playability led to many people who may not

2572
04:00:02,380 --> 04:00:08,380
have usually played video games being willing to give it a go. Its best-selling titles reflect

2573
04:00:08,380 --> 04:00:15,500
this broader appeal, with the bundled Wii Sports selling and impressive 82.9 million copies.

2574
04:00:16,620 --> 04:00:21,180
Wii Sports didn't receive the strongest critical reception, mostly due to the gameplay's lack of

2575
04:00:21,180 --> 04:00:26,460
depth, but its simplicity worked well as an introduction to motion control and as a way to

2576
04:00:26,460 --> 04:00:33,660
attract those new to gaming. Other new first-party motion control games like Wii Play, Wii Fit,

2577
04:00:33,660 --> 04:00:39,260
Wii Party, and Wii Sports Resort also sold impressive numbers, with Nintendo managing

2578
04:00:39,260 --> 04:00:44,300
to showcase various creative ways to use their new technology, particularly through the combination

2579
04:00:44,300 --> 04:00:50,780
of exercise and gaming in Wii Fit. Alongside these were many of the classic series people

2580
04:00:50,780 --> 04:00:56,220
have come to expect from Nintendo, with Mario Kart Wii and new Super Mario Bros Wii being the

2581
04:00:56,220 --> 04:01:02,300
best-selling titles, and Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Smash Bros Brawl,

2582
04:01:02,300 --> 04:01:05,900
and for Legends of Zelda Twilight Princess being its most highly acclaimed.

2583
04:01:07,100 --> 04:01:12,220
Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 stood out in particular for once more offering a fresh take on the 3D

2584
04:01:12,220 --> 04:01:17,420
Mario formula, this time with a space theme and lots of creative level design focused on

2585
04:01:17,420 --> 04:01:23,100
different uses of gravity. Much of the Wii's library focused on its motion controls however,

2586
04:01:23,100 --> 04:01:28,780
and on this aspect opinions varied, with some seeing it as a bold new step for gaming and

2587
04:01:28,780 --> 04:01:34,460
others seeing it as more of an imprecise gimmick. The legacy of the Wii is also hard to judge.

2588
04:01:35,180 --> 04:01:40,140
It was the best-selling system of its generation, and yet in its later years its sales fell

2589
04:01:40,140 --> 04:01:46,300
consistently behind both its rivals in hardware and software, and this severe loss of momentum

2590
04:01:46,300 --> 04:01:51,340
may have went on to hurt Nintendo's next console. For a time it looked like the system

2591
04:01:51,340 --> 04:01:56,780
would live up to its early codename, but in the end the motion control revolution didn't really

2592
04:01:56,780 --> 04:02:01,900
amount to much, suggesting that the success of the system might have been more down to novelty

2593
04:02:01,900 --> 04:02:07,340
than the inherent value that motion control provided. There were also problems beyond the

2594
04:02:07,340 --> 04:02:13,420
system's less impressive graphics, with poor online support, poor audio, and a plethora of

2595
04:02:13,420 --> 04:02:18,460
lower quality titles that seemed designed to purely cash in on the latest craze with little

2596
04:02:18,460 --> 04:02:24,780
regard to quality. This came alongside a lack of long-term third-party support from more established

2597
04:02:24,780 --> 04:02:29,820
video game developers, who often stated they found motion controls difficult to implement and develop

2598
04:02:29,820 --> 04:02:35,660
for. The Wii would also miss out on many multi-platform games due to the difficulty of porting to a

2599
04:02:35,660 --> 04:02:42,220
system with lower technical specifications. Yet at the same time, the Nintendo Wii was one of the

2600
04:02:42,220 --> 04:02:48,380
most unique and daring consoles the gaming industry has ever seen, and it remains an iconic part of

2601
04:02:48,380 --> 04:02:55,340
gaming in the 2000s. And while motion controls may not have been the future for mainstream gaming,

2602
04:02:55,900 --> 04:03:02,860
appealing to wider demographics may well have been. The 2000s would see another trend come and go

2603
04:03:02,860 --> 04:03:08,860
in the form of accessory-based rhythm games. Across different systems and different titles,

2604
04:03:08,860 --> 04:03:15,020
the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series saw hugely impressive sales, and while this sub-genre soon

2605
04:03:15,020 --> 04:03:19,980
fell away, this was around the same time but smartphones and mobile gaming were starting

2606
04:03:19,980 --> 04:03:25,420
to explode and conquer the casual market as well as a big chunk of the entire industry in the process.

2607
04:03:26,860 --> 04:03:30,620
In this sense, the Wii may have been ahead of its time in making inroads

2608
04:03:30,620 --> 04:03:37,180
into new, more casual audiences. But it would soon find itself outgunned in the great casual war

2609
04:03:37,180 --> 04:03:42,620
by the rapidly growing mobile market. Mobile gaming wasn't the only thing on the rise at

2610
04:03:42,620 --> 04:03:47,020
the end of the decade, however, as while console gaming was increasingly going big,

2611
04:03:47,660 --> 04:03:50,860
some developers started to take a rather different approach.

2612
04:03:57,340 --> 04:04:03,180
The 2000s can be seen as the decade where AAA gaming came to dominate, with bigger budgets,

2613
04:04:03,260 --> 04:04:08,540
better graphics and longer development cycles at the same time that certain styles or genres of

2614
04:04:08,540 --> 04:04:14,780
games were increasingly being pushed out of the limelight. But in the shadow of this increased

2615
04:04:14,780 --> 04:04:20,300
focus on blockbuster titles at the expense of all else, something else started to appear in the

2616
04:04:20,300 --> 04:04:26,460
decade's second half. Independent game development had long played a vital role in PC gaming,

2617
04:04:27,420 --> 04:04:32,380
from pioneering students in the 70s to bedroom coders in the 80s to shareware

2618
04:04:32,380 --> 04:04:36,860
successes in the 90s and even modding innovations at the turn of the decade,

2619
04:04:36,860 --> 04:04:41,100
independent development was around since the industry's beginning, and it never stopped

2620
04:04:41,100 --> 04:04:47,740
being important. Still, throughout the 90s and 2000s, the technological gap between what small

2621
04:04:47,740 --> 04:04:54,060
independent teams and big commercial studios could do grew and grew, moving the industry

2622
04:04:54,060 --> 04:04:59,740
further and further away from independent development. In the early 2000s, however,

2623
04:04:59,820 --> 04:05:03,740
several factors would align that helped give rise to a new form of indie game development.

2624
04:05:04,780 --> 04:05:09,580
The first was the internet, which paved the way for more effective online distribution

2625
04:05:09,580 --> 04:05:15,180
without the need for retailers or publishers. The internet also saw the start of browser-based

2626
04:05:15,180 --> 04:05:21,660
gaming, which was made possible through programs like Java and Adobe Flash. This would give rise

2627
04:05:21,660 --> 04:05:26,620
to a wealth of user-generated content, with hosting sites like Newgrounds seeing massive

2628
04:05:26,620 --> 04:05:32,060
amounts of traffic over the decades, proving the popularity of even much more limited games,

2629
04:05:32,060 --> 04:05:37,820
with some browser-based games quickly becoming successful enough to get full PC retail releases,

2630
04:05:37,820 --> 04:05:45,900
like with PopCap's 2001 match 3 game Bejewelled. At the same time as this, new dedicated software

2631
04:05:45,900 --> 04:05:52,780
like Game Maker Studio and new unified game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine were starting to lower

2632
04:05:52,780 --> 04:05:59,580
the programming barrier to entry in game development. Finally, in 2004 Half-Life 2 released,

2633
04:05:59,580 --> 04:06:07,100
and indie gaming would never be the same. Because despite being very far from an indie game itself,

2634
04:06:07,100 --> 04:06:12,700
Half-Life 2 was the first game to be offered on and required the installation of Steam.

2635
04:06:14,220 --> 04:06:19,420
The Half-Life community wasn't exactly happy about this, but the Half-Life community didn't

2636
04:06:19,420 --> 04:06:27,100
have a choice, and Half-Life 2 was a difficult game to resist. In 2005, Steam would release its first

2637
04:06:27,100 --> 04:06:32,620
third-party games on the platform, including independent titles like Ragdoll Kong Fu and

2638
04:06:32,620 --> 04:06:39,660
Darwinia. And as Steam's digital distribution model cut out retailers and manufacturing costs,

2639
04:06:39,660 --> 04:06:44,780
it gave developers a higher profit margin, meaning that once Valve proved the model could work,

2640
04:06:44,780 --> 04:06:50,620
they were able to start attracting bigger names, including id Software, Idos and Capcom,

2641
04:06:50,620 --> 04:06:56,220
leading to further growth for the platform. This came alongside the rise of the term

2642
04:06:56,220 --> 04:07:02,060
indie game. Once upon a time, there were no distinctions between games on the basis of developer

2643
04:07:02,060 --> 04:07:07,980
status or budget, but as the industry grew, people eventually started to differentiate between

2644
04:07:07,980 --> 04:07:13,900
small, cheaper, independent titles and the more traditional full-priced commercial releases.

2645
04:07:15,180 --> 04:07:20,620
One of the first games to help create this distinction was Cave Story, which was developed

2646
04:07:20,620 --> 04:07:28,300
by one man, Daisuke Amaya, over a five-year period starting when he was in college. Amaya was inspired

2647
04:07:28,300 --> 04:07:34,300
by the games he played growing up, like Metroid, and so he made a 2D platforming adventure game

2648
04:07:34,300 --> 04:07:41,340
with a retro visual style. Cave Story was finished in late 2004, with Amaya making it available

2649
04:07:41,340 --> 04:07:46,460
online for free. The reason he didn't charge anything was because he thought the shareware

2650
04:07:46,460 --> 04:07:51,900
model would be too much hassle to implement, and he just wanted more people to play his game

2651
04:07:51,900 --> 04:07:58,860
after working on it for so long. And people did play his game, with several western media outlets

2652
04:07:58,860 --> 04:08:03,580
reporting on and praising it soon after its release, and showing amazement that such a game

2653
04:08:03,580 --> 04:08:10,780
could come from just one single developer. But as Cave Story released for free in a time before

2654
04:08:10,780 --> 04:08:16,140
most people had ever heard the term indie game, it didn't find mainstream success, and Amaya

2655
04:08:16,140 --> 04:08:21,260
simply continued working his full-time job at a printing company until six years later when

2656
04:08:21,260 --> 04:08:26,060
Cave Story released on Nintendo's WiiWare service and finally became a commercial success.

2657
04:08:27,420 --> 04:08:33,260
Cave Story has been described as the quintessential indie game and it would inspire others to follow

2658
04:08:33,260 --> 04:08:39,020
in its wake, while digital distribution and new development tools made doing so more and more

2659
04:08:39,020 --> 04:08:45,740
achievable. The next major step for indie games would once again come from Valve and a non-indie

2660
04:08:45,740 --> 04:08:53,180
game however. Portal, released in 2007 and its creative puzzle design and memorable story made

2661
04:08:53,180 --> 04:08:59,660
it one of the year's most critically acclaimed games. Portal was only about three hours long however,

2662
04:08:59,660 --> 04:09:05,420
which seemed far too short for a normal full-priced commercial release. As a result,

2663
04:09:05,420 --> 04:09:11,340
Valve got around this by selling it alongside Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 in a retail

2664
04:09:11,340 --> 04:09:18,140
compilation called The Orange Box. Still, Portal's high quality and widespread popularity clearly

2665
04:09:18,140 --> 04:09:23,820
highlighted the potential of smaller, more focused games. At the same time as this,

2666
04:09:23,820 --> 04:09:28,300
Microsoft were looking to promote their own Xbox-focused digital distribution store,

2667
04:09:28,300 --> 04:09:34,140
Xbox Live Arcade, which was a perfect place for indie games due to their smaller download sizes.

2668
04:09:35,100 --> 04:09:41,340
And so, Microsoft began the Xbox Live Arcade Wednesdays program, which promised a new arcade

2669
04:09:41,340 --> 04:09:47,260
game to be released each week over summer, as well as the Xbox Live Arcade unplugged compilation

2670
04:09:47,260 --> 04:09:54,780
discs to promote Xbox Live Arcade games to normal retail consumers. This was followed by the Xbox

2671
04:09:54,780 --> 04:10:00,700
Live Summer of Arcade, which began in 2008 and saw Microsoft heavily promote a series of newly

2672
04:10:00,780 --> 04:10:06,540
releasing indie games each summer. The first year's lineup included Castle Crashers,

2673
04:10:06,540 --> 04:10:13,740
Bionic Commando Rearmed, Gallagher Legions, Geometry Wars 2, and Braid. And this proved

2674
04:10:13,740 --> 04:10:18,220
to be a big success, which helped establish the concept of indie games with general audiences.

2675
04:10:19,340 --> 04:10:24,220
By 2009, promising indie titles were starting to become a common occurrence even outside of

2676
04:10:24,220 --> 04:10:30,940
Xbox's Summer of Arcade and Steam. Spelunky, from Derrick U, combined platforming gameplay with

2677
04:10:30,940 --> 04:10:36,140
the procedural generation of roguelikes to create a new type of non-traditional roguelike design

2678
04:10:36,140 --> 04:10:42,460
that many future games would emulate. Flower, from Back Game Company, released on PSN and took

2679
04:10:42,460 --> 04:10:47,180
players on a calm and emotional journey that contrasted sharply from the violence of most

2680
04:10:47,180 --> 04:10:53,340
mainstream games. And World of Goo, from 2D Boy, released on PC and Wii and impressed with its

2681
04:10:53,340 --> 04:11:00,620
simple yet challenging puzzle design and memorable presentation. And so, by 2010, indie games in the

2682
04:11:00,620 --> 04:11:05,500
form that we think of them today had arrived and they were just starting to become an important

2683
04:11:05,500 --> 04:11:17,020
force within an industry that was otherwise moving in the opposite direction. At the start of the

2684
04:11:17,020 --> 04:11:21,980
decade, Sony were at the top of the industry and were preparing for the release of a console that

2685
04:11:21,980 --> 04:11:28,380
would soon be even more successful. By the end of the decade, they were in last place and trying

2686
04:11:28,380 --> 04:11:33,340
desperately to rebuild their damage reputation. At the start of the decade, Microsoft was still

2687
04:11:33,340 --> 04:11:37,740
yet to formally enter the gaming space, yet by the decade's end, they were in the strongest

2688
04:11:37,740 --> 04:11:42,380
position they would ever find themselves in, with the Xbox looking increasingly like the

2689
04:11:42,380 --> 04:11:49,180
core gaming console of choice. At the start of the decade, Nintendo were THE company for classic

2690
04:11:49,180 --> 04:11:55,500
console gaming, yet by its end, they were finding new levels of success by appealing to new audiences

2691
04:11:55,500 --> 04:12:02,140
with new types of technology. Things change fast in the gaming industry, and in just a few more

2692
04:12:02,140 --> 04:12:09,020
years, everything just mentioned would end up changing again. But it wasn't just the fates

2693
04:12:09,020 --> 04:12:15,340
of the major players that were in flux in the 2000s. Game design itself would see major evolution

2694
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:19,180
as mainstream gaming moved further and further towards a triple-A approach.

2695
04:12:20,140 --> 04:12:25,100
The jump from the 6th to 7th console generation would be the last time that new consoles would

2696
04:12:25,100 --> 04:12:31,340
bring a really noticeable upgrade in graphics, as games went from 480 to 720 resolution,

2697
04:12:31,900 --> 04:12:37,660
but even this came at a cost, as the average frame rate of console games dropped as a result

2698
04:12:37,660 --> 04:12:44,460
from 60 FPS down to 30. For years, gaming graphics had steadily increased,

2699
04:12:44,460 --> 04:12:49,260
but now, the industry was starting to see diminishing returns, with sacrifices having to

2700
04:12:49,260 --> 04:12:55,660
be made to performance to make continued advancement possible. And yet, the best-selling

2701
04:12:55,660 --> 04:13:00,460
and most critically acclaimed games were, without doubt, the ones that looked the best.

2702
04:13:01,500 --> 04:13:08,220
In 2009, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 broke records for sales, and Uncharted 2 broke records

2703
04:13:08,220 --> 04:13:14,300
for Game of the Year awards, with both games putting a huge focus on linear cinematic set pieces

2704
04:13:14,300 --> 04:13:17,820
and the highest levels of presentation that technology would allow.

2705
04:13:18,780 --> 04:13:24,220
And yet, while mainstream gaming was getting noticeably more expensive and less diverse,

2706
04:13:24,220 --> 04:13:29,740
it was other areas of gaming that would see the largest growth. At the end of 2009,

2707
04:13:29,740 --> 04:13:35,740
rovio entertainment's Angry Birds and Pop Caps, Plants vs Zombies had just released,

2708
04:13:35,740 --> 04:13:40,460
as smartphone-fuelled mobile gaming was becoming a larger and larger section of the industry.

2709
04:13:41,260 --> 04:13:46,220
Sony and Microsoft were both preparing for the release of their own motion-controlled devices

2710
04:13:46,220 --> 04:13:51,500
to try to replicate Nintendo's success with casual audiences, and a little indie game by

2711
04:13:51,500 --> 04:13:56,940
the name of Minecraft was starting to make waves online after its first release to the public,

2712
04:13:56,940 --> 04:14:01,980
while a little multiplayer game called League of Legends was just coming to the end of its beta.

2713
04:14:03,180 --> 04:14:09,660
Gaming was changing, just like it always does, and the changes of the next decade

2714
04:14:09,660 --> 04:14:16,300
would see some of the industry's toughest challenges yet, alongside some of its best and worst moments.

2715
04:14:23,260 --> 04:14:28,940
The console wars would continue in the 2010s, but the first battle was fought over motion controls.

2716
04:14:29,900 --> 04:14:33,980
Nintendo had responded to criticism of the original Wii Remote's poor precision

2717
04:14:33,980 --> 04:14:40,940
with the Wii Motion Plus in 2009. This new add-on upped the accuracy, but only in games developed

2718
04:14:40,940 --> 04:14:45,900
with it in mind, and it would be required for certain later titles like Wii Sports Resort

2719
04:14:45,900 --> 04:14:51,900
and The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword. Still, both Sony and Microsoft focused their marketing

2720
04:14:51,900 --> 04:14:55,180
on why their new devices were better than the Wii.

2721
04:15:03,980 --> 04:15:08,460
Sony boasted about their accuracy, pointing to the little glowing plastic ball on the end of

2722
04:15:08,460 --> 04:15:13,820
the PlayStation Move Remote as proof that the device is special, and making liberal use of

2723
04:15:13,820 --> 04:15:20,300
terms like accelerometer, inertial sensors, synergistic processing units, and internal

2724
04:15:20,300 --> 04:15:24,860
magnetometers. And no, I did not make any of both terms up just now.

2725
04:15:26,060 --> 04:15:30,780
Microsoft, on the other hand, decided the best marketing strategy was to freak everyone out

2726
04:15:30,780 --> 04:15:35,100
with their surreal virtual child simulator, Project Milo, in 2009.

2727
04:16:01,740 --> 04:16:12,460
Unfortunately, while it may have apparently worked that day, one year later, when Microsoft

2728
04:16:12,460 --> 04:16:16,780
returned to showcase the Kinect again, it was rather less impressive, being something more

2729
04:16:16,780 --> 04:16:21,980
in line with the earlier PlayStation Eye toy. Meanwhile, the child Milo was never seen again.

2730
04:16:23,260 --> 04:16:28,300
For gaming fans that were happy using normal controllers, this was a strange time to be alive.

2731
04:16:29,260 --> 04:16:35,100
Both E3 and gaming media were dominated by the new upcoming battle for motion control supremacy.

2732
04:16:35,980 --> 04:16:41,660
For a time, the question of who would win between Kinect, the Move, and the Wii was treated with

2733
04:16:41,660 --> 04:16:46,860
the utmost importance, as if we were only now about to see the real battle that would determine

2734
04:16:46,860 --> 04:16:52,380
gaming's future. In the end, though, it turned out gaming's future had other plans.

2735
04:16:53,340 --> 04:16:58,780
The PlayStation Move, released in September 2010, received positive reviews for accuracy

2736
04:16:58,780 --> 04:17:03,980
and responsiveness, particularly when compared to the Wii, and then produced disappointing sales,

2737
04:17:03,980 --> 04:17:08,380
as the more serious gaming audience Sony were targeting at the time showed little interest.

2738
04:17:09,260 --> 04:17:13,500
A disappointing selection of games to support it certainly didn't help either,

2739
04:17:13,500 --> 04:17:15,980
and in three years' time, it was all but forgotten.

2740
04:17:16,140 --> 04:17:23,020
Microsoft's Kinect, on the other hand, released in November 2010 for a higher price and received

2741
04:17:23,020 --> 04:17:27,420
worse reviews, and then it broke the world records for the fastest-selling consumer

2742
04:17:27,420 --> 04:17:33,020
electronic device, while easily surpassing the Move in the process, probably because it was

2743
04:17:33,020 --> 04:17:37,740
marketed heavily towards a more casual audience and the controller-free experience it offered

2744
04:17:37,740 --> 04:17:44,300
was something different to the already widespread Wii. Reviewers criticised input lag and the lack

2745
04:17:44,300 --> 04:17:49,980
of depth in games on offer, but did praise the Kinect's innovativeness. Three years later,

2746
04:17:49,980 --> 04:17:56,140
and the Kinect was far from forgotten, but we'll get to that later. Around this time,

2747
04:17:56,140 --> 04:18:00,620
the Wii would also see its sales slow, as the motion control craze seemed to be coming to

2748
04:18:00,620 --> 04:18:06,700
its natural conclusion after the novelty started to wear off. Still, while motion control might

2749
04:18:06,700 --> 04:18:10,860
have dominated the news at that time, something else was dominating sales.

2750
04:18:11,340 --> 04:18:16,700
In 2009, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 broke sales records for biggest entertainment launch

2751
04:18:16,700 --> 04:18:24,300
in history, across all media. In 2010, Call of Duty Black Ops broke the same records,

2752
04:18:24,300 --> 04:18:31,020
surpassing Modern Warfare 2. In 2011, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 broke records again,

2753
04:18:31,020 --> 04:18:36,860
surpassing Black Ops, and in 2012, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 broke records again,

2754
04:18:37,020 --> 04:18:43,740
surpassing Modern Warfare 3. Call of Duty's reign of terror would not last forever,

2755
04:18:43,740 --> 04:18:50,300
but at the start of the 2010s, it certainly seemed like it might. Put simply, Call of Duty was the

2756
04:18:50,300 --> 04:18:55,740
biggest thing in gaming at the time, with release after release, easily managing to sell over 20

2757
04:18:55,740 --> 04:19:02,620
million copies, and there was a new release every single year. The multiplayer formula established

2758
04:19:02,620 --> 04:19:08,300
by Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare proved incredibly popular with players, and Activision was happy

2759
04:19:08,300 --> 04:19:14,380
to do everything they could to cash in on this. And so, in a time when there was less online

2760
04:19:14,380 --> 04:19:21,900
shooter competition, Call of Duty became the undisputed king. Amidst the soaring popularity of

2761
04:19:21,900 --> 04:19:27,900
mobile games, the yearly domination of Call of Duty, and the newly arriving motion control devices,

2762
04:19:27,900 --> 04:19:33,900
there was a sense at this time that older, or core gaming audiences, might be being left behind

2763
04:19:33,900 --> 04:19:38,940
in an industry that didn't seem to need them anymore. This would play a major role in the

2764
04:19:38,940 --> 04:19:43,980
next console generation, but there were still well-received games being released in this period,

2765
04:19:43,980 --> 04:19:48,540
and amongst them, a new trend was on the rise. The Open World

2766
04:19:49,660 --> 04:19:54,380
After the record success of Grand Theft Auto on the PlayStation 2, it's no surprise that more

2767
04:19:54,380 --> 04:19:59,580
games would try to copy its approach to Open World design, but while the 2000s would see a large

2768
04:19:59,580 --> 04:20:05,740
number of Grand Theft Auto clones, few of them ended up leaving a lasting impact. Things would

2769
04:20:05,740 --> 04:20:10,300
change at the start of the next decade, however, as developers started to look beyond Grand Theft

2770
04:20:10,300 --> 04:20:18,940
Auto for Open World inspiration. Games like Fallout 3 in 2008, Assassin's Creed II in 2009, Red Dead

2771
04:20:18,940 --> 04:20:26,060
Redemption and Fallout New Vegas in 2010, Batman, Arkham City and the Elder Scrolls V Skyrim in 2011,

2772
04:20:26,060 --> 04:20:32,460
and Far Cry 3 in 2012 all achieved critical and commercial success to help popularise the

2773
04:20:32,460 --> 04:20:37,580
Open World as a concept that would soon come to be used more broadly in mainstream game design.

2774
04:20:38,780 --> 04:20:43,980
And as the decade continued, more and more games made the transition to Open World,

2775
04:20:44,060 --> 04:20:50,460
including most of the biggest series in gaming, like Metal Gear Solid, The Witcher, Dragon Age,

2776
04:20:50,460 --> 04:20:58,540
Final Fantasy, Mass Effect, Forza, The Legend of Zelda, Halo and Pokemon, alongside many of the

2777
04:20:58,540 --> 04:21:06,060
decade's biggest new IPs. This fit the established gaming industry trends of trying to make bigger

2778
04:21:06,060 --> 04:21:11,180
and better games to continually one up what came before, where Open World seemed to represent

2779
04:21:11,180 --> 04:21:15,980
the next step in this while also providing an opportunity to breathe new life into established

2780
04:21:15,980 --> 04:21:21,980
franchises. The move towards Open World brought benefits like increased immersion and player

2781
04:21:21,980 --> 04:21:27,340
freedom, but it would also lead to criticism about repetition and game experiences being drawn out

2782
04:21:27,340 --> 04:21:32,620
or padded, with the term Open World Fatigue sometimes being used as the decade continued.

2783
04:21:33,820 --> 04:21:39,020
Still, at the start of the decade, Open Worlds were relatively fresh, and early examples like

2784
04:21:39,020 --> 04:21:43,500
Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim were some of the most highly praised and best-selling games

2785
04:21:43,500 --> 04:21:49,420
of their respective years. Still, while much of gaming at this time was moving in certain

2786
04:21:49,420 --> 04:21:54,380
recognizable directions, there were two games which stood out for doing something different.

2787
04:21:55,660 --> 04:22:02,540
The first was Dark Souls, which released in 2011 on consoles and 2012 on PC.

2788
04:22:02,780 --> 04:22:08,220
From Software had already impressed players with Demon's Souls in 2009, but Dark Souls was where

2789
04:22:08,220 --> 04:22:12,940
they would reach a much wider audience, and the game quickly developed a reputation for its high

2790
04:22:12,940 --> 04:22:19,340
difficulty and unforgiving design. What really made Dark Souls stand out however was how different

2791
04:22:19,340 --> 04:22:25,340
it felt from so many other games of its era. Since the days of arcades, video games had been

2792
04:22:25,340 --> 04:22:30,620
becoming easier and more accessible year after year, to the point where increasing accessibility

2793
04:22:30,860 --> 04:22:38,060
was seen as a fundamental part of good game design. The general consensus was that older

2794
04:22:38,060 --> 04:22:44,380
games were often far too punishing, so developers added things like regenerating health and regular

2795
04:22:44,380 --> 04:22:51,580
checkpoints. Or that old games were too vague and confusing, so developers added more tutorials,

2796
04:22:51,580 --> 04:22:58,380
guidance, and features like mini-maps. Or that old games were too simple and video-gamey,

2797
04:22:58,380 --> 04:23:03,740
so developers focused more on the cinematic side with action set pieces and cutscenes.

2798
04:23:04,940 --> 04:23:12,540
And then, Dark Souls came along and ignored all of this. It punished players for mistakes,

2799
04:23:12,540 --> 04:23:18,220
even taking away their valuable experience points. It gave players minimal direction and made a world

2800
04:23:18,220 --> 04:23:24,380
where it was easy to get lost, and it told its story almost entirely indirectly, leaving 99%

2801
04:23:24,460 --> 04:23:30,620
of the experience as pure gameplay. Dark Souls broke all the rules about how a modern game

2802
04:23:30,620 --> 04:23:36,940
should be designed, and in doing so, it created something unique which many players fell in love

2803
04:23:36,940 --> 04:23:43,020
with. With time, Dark Souls developed one of the most enduring legacies of any game from the

2804
04:23:43,020 --> 04:23:49,660
modern era, although its reception at release was more modest. It was only the 32nd highest

2805
04:23:49,660 --> 04:23:56,940
reviewed game from 2011, and it was widely ignored by Game of the Year awards. Yet, it was also a

2806
04:23:56,940 --> 04:24:03,020
game which people kept playing and talking about, and soon its influence was hard to deny. Every

2807
04:24:03,020 --> 04:24:08,540
difficult game would come to be compared to it. Countless indie games would directly copy it,

2808
04:24:08,540 --> 04:24:14,380
and even mainstream games would start to indirectly copy it, all while its reputation kept growing.

2809
04:24:14,620 --> 04:24:20,860
In short, from combat design, to the lack of handholding, to the use of difficulty, or its

2810
04:24:20,860 --> 04:24:26,220
approach to storytelling, Dark Souls was a title which made the industry re-evaluate what good

2811
04:24:26,220 --> 04:24:33,420
game design truly meant, and yet, it arguably wasn't even the most important game released that year.

2812
04:24:34,860 --> 04:24:37,660
If Dark Souls challenged how people fought about game design,

2813
04:24:38,220 --> 04:24:43,420
Minecraft challenged how people fought about video games. Beginning at the hands of a single

2814
04:24:43,420 --> 04:24:48,940
developer, Marcus Notch Pearson, Minecraft would go on to become the best-selling game of all time,

2815
04:24:48,940 --> 04:24:55,020
with a staggering 238 million copies sold, a number which is still rising.

2816
04:24:56,380 --> 04:25:02,220
Notch took inspiration from the ambitious ColonySim, Dwarf Fortress, and the block-based mining game

2817
04:25:02,220 --> 04:25:07,980
Infiniminer to create a procedurally generated block-building sandbox that was made available

2818
04:25:07,980 --> 04:25:13,420
to the public online in 2009, and received regular updates over the next two years.

2819
04:25:14,780 --> 04:25:21,500
In 2011, it received its official release, and in 2014, Minecraft was bought by Microsoft for

2820
04:25:21,500 --> 04:25:28,620
$2.5 billion, with the game still receiving regular updates to this day. Beyond simply being one of

2821
04:25:28,620 --> 04:25:34,380
the most played games ever made, Minecraft popularized the concept of early access, where players

2822
04:25:34,380 --> 04:25:39,260
paid to access a game that's still in development, and continuous development, where a game is

2823
04:25:39,260 --> 04:25:45,340
continually expanded over time with no specific planned ending. It also challenged the perceived

2824
04:25:45,340 --> 04:25:50,860
importance of graphics in gaming. For years, graphics had been getting better and better,

2825
04:25:50,860 --> 04:25:56,380
and becoming a larger and larger priority, even as this caused development time and costs to

2826
04:25:56,380 --> 04:26:02,780
continually increase. Then, Minecraft came along with pixelated blocky visuals that looked

2827
04:26:02,780 --> 04:26:07,180
several generations old, and became the most successful game in history.

2828
04:26:08,460 --> 04:26:14,300
In doing so, Minecraft proved that not only are high quality graphics not needed for a game to be

2829
04:26:14,300 --> 04:26:21,500
successful, but also that graphics might sometimes be holding gaming back. Minecraft's popularity

2830
04:26:21,500 --> 04:26:26,780
was a result of the freedom it provided players to create and explore and do more than most other

2831
04:26:26,780 --> 04:26:32,140
games allowed, and this level of freedom was only made possible by the simpler visual style,

2832
04:26:32,140 --> 04:26:37,420
where not every asset needed thousands and thousands of polygons or multiple dedicated artists.

2833
04:26:38,620 --> 04:26:43,660
At a time when the gaming industry was fully embracing AAA design and indie games were still

2834
04:26:43,660 --> 04:26:50,620
finding their footing, Minecraft was a monumental statement about what video games could and maybe

2835
04:26:50,620 --> 04:26:58,460
should be. And between Minecraft, Dark Souls, the open world trend, yearly call of duties,

2836
04:26:58,460 --> 04:27:03,820
and unwanted motion controls, you have a great representation of what the next decade in gaming

2837
04:27:03,820 --> 04:27:10,700
would be all about. Video games were changing just like they always were, but now conflicts and

2838
04:27:10,700 --> 04:27:15,660
divisions were starting to be more obvious as the industry continued to grow and expand.

2839
04:27:16,700 --> 04:27:21,900
Within this, multiple distinct battles can be identified, like mainstream versus indie,

2840
04:27:22,460 --> 04:27:29,820
conventional game design versus counterculture, core gaming versus casual, maximizing monetization

2841
04:27:29,820 --> 04:27:36,140
versus preserving a franchise, and so on. And it was these divisions that would truly define

2842
04:27:36,140 --> 04:27:40,540
the next decade, including the next generation of console warfare.

2843
04:27:40,780 --> 04:27:50,220
In the 7th generation, Sony shocked the world by losing.

2844
04:27:51,260 --> 04:27:57,980
After years of PlayStation domination, Sony looked unstoppable, but a high price,

2845
04:27:57,980 --> 04:28:02,860
complicated system architecture, and the loss of key exclusives allowed Microsoft to close the

2846
04:28:02,860 --> 04:28:07,900
gap with core gamers while Nintendo thrived for appealing to new and more casual audiences.

2847
04:28:08,860 --> 04:28:12,140
The fate of all three of these companies would soon change though,

2848
04:28:12,140 --> 04:28:15,340
and this started before the next generation even arrived.

2849
04:28:16,540 --> 04:28:22,620
After years of leading the pack, the Wii sales fell behind both the 360 and PS3 at the same time

2850
04:28:22,620 --> 04:28:26,860
that new motion control competition arrived and consumer interest seemed to wane.

2851
04:28:27,980 --> 04:28:33,900
Microsoft saw its lead over Sony dwindle and eventually disappear as the 360 lost momentum

2852
04:28:33,980 --> 04:28:39,980
amidst few new exclusives, and Sony's system saw its finest years after price cuts and model

2853
04:28:39,980 --> 04:28:45,980
revisions turned around sales. Sony's strong end to the generation would be complete with the release

2854
04:28:45,980 --> 04:28:52,620
of The Last of Us in summer 2013, which was heralded as one of the finest games of the generation,

2855
04:28:52,620 --> 04:28:58,140
at the same time that the PS3 finally managed to overtake the 360's total lifetime sales.

2856
04:28:58,140 --> 04:29:04,540
Focus then turned to the next generation, which had officially begun in 2012.

2857
04:29:29,100 --> 04:29:37,260
This was the world first reveal of Nintendo's new console as shown at E3 2011.

2858
04:29:38,460 --> 04:29:41,900
You may notice a heavy emphasis on the word controller.

2859
04:29:42,860 --> 04:29:48,700
This trailer is 3 minutes long and that word shows up on screen 12 different times.

2860
04:29:49,900 --> 04:29:55,340
The word console isn't used once and the Wii U console isn't even shown.

2861
04:29:55,340 --> 04:30:01,980
The Wii U was one of Nintendo's greatest failures and much of that failure is often said to be down

2862
04:30:01,980 --> 04:30:08,460
to consumers failing to understand what the system even was. Looking at the reveal trailer shows how

2863
04:30:08,460 --> 04:30:15,260
this might have happened and even among gaming media this caused some confusion. Amongst general

2864
04:30:15,260 --> 04:30:21,020
consumers who may not follow gaming news closely, i.e. much of the Wii's new player base, it would

2865
04:30:21,020 --> 04:30:27,180
have been easy to mistake this device as just an expensive add-on or a new Nintendo themed tablet

2866
04:30:27,180 --> 04:30:34,220
and this poor marketing decision surely hurt the system's sales. This isn't the whole story however

2867
04:30:34,220 --> 04:30:39,500
and even during its development the Wii U experienced a bit of an identity crisis that went on to

2868
04:30:39,500 --> 04:30:46,860
follow it for the rest of its life. The Wii exceeded Nintendo's expectations and excelled with casual

2869
04:30:46,860 --> 04:30:52,300
gamers but Nintendo started to worry that if they appealed too much to casual audiences it might hurt

2870
04:30:52,300 --> 04:30:58,620
their reputation with more core audiences. As a result, Nintendo made bridging the gap between

2871
04:30:58,620 --> 04:31:05,180
the two groups a priority for their next system and so they decided on HD graphics as this was

2872
04:31:05,180 --> 04:31:10,700
expected from core audiences and that it should also include a new innovative feature that could

2873
04:31:10,700 --> 04:31:17,740
appeal to families and Wii fans hence the tablet like controller. This controller wasn't as

2874
04:31:17,740 --> 04:31:22,540
revolutionary as the Wii's motion controller bin though as tablet computers were already gaining

2875
04:31:22,540 --> 04:31:29,820
popularity at this time. The controller was also heavy and bulky in design, had a short battery life

2876
04:31:29,820 --> 04:31:35,340
and needed to be in range of the Wii U console to be used making it more limited than an actual tablet.

2877
04:31:36,540 --> 04:31:39,980
Nintendo also struggled to show off the advantages this hybrid approach brought to

2878
04:31:39,980 --> 04:31:45,740
game design whereas the Wii's motion control was simple to understand and easily demonstrated.

2879
04:31:47,180 --> 04:31:55,580
Still, in November 2012 the Wii U launched to the public for $299 or $349. The critical

2880
04:31:55,580 --> 04:32:00,780
reception was mostly positive with praise given to its backwards compatibility with Wii games and

2881
04:32:00,780 --> 04:32:07,020
peripherals as well as the potential of its unique controller. Initial sales were lower than Nintendo

2882
04:32:07,020 --> 04:32:12,540
expected though and the launch lineup had few must-play titles with the best sellers being a new

2883
04:32:12,540 --> 04:32:19,580
new Super Mario Bros and the party game Nintendo Land. As time went on Nintendo would release more

2884
04:32:19,580 --> 04:32:25,100
games on the system including new entries into most of the series people expected like Mario Kart

2885
04:32:25,100 --> 04:32:29,580
and Smash Bros although the importance of these games may have been diminished by the fact that

2886
04:32:29,580 --> 04:32:36,220
many also released on Nintendo's latest handheld the 3DS. The Wii U's biggest problem however would

2887
04:32:36,220 --> 04:32:42,780
once again be third party support. At the start of the Wii U's life it was on par with the still

2888
04:32:42,780 --> 04:32:49,500
current PS3 and Xbox 360 meaning titles could be ported between these systems and these ports made

2889
04:32:49,500 --> 04:32:55,180
up a big part of the Wii U's early lineup. These games rarely made interesting use of the Wii U's

2890
04:32:55,180 --> 04:33:00,060
unique controller and sometimes ran worse than the older generation versions due to differences

2891
04:33:00,060 --> 04:33:04,860
with the system's hardware but this was still a lot better than what was to follow.

2892
04:33:06,300 --> 04:33:11,020
Once the next generation of consoles arrived the Wii U once again became technically inferior

2893
04:33:11,020 --> 04:33:15,900
to its rivals causing great difficulty for third parties when porting multi-platform games to the

2894
04:33:15,900 --> 04:33:22,220
system and as the Wii U got off to a slow start which led to a small user base third parties

2895
04:33:22,220 --> 04:33:28,060
then had even less incentive to bring their games to the system at all. Less than one year after its

2896
04:33:28,060 --> 04:33:34,460
release EA and Bethesda both publicly stated that they had little plans for future Wii U games and

2897
04:33:34,460 --> 04:33:40,620
this problem only grew over time. By the end of the Wii U's life the only game amongst its best

2898
04:33:40,620 --> 04:33:47,340
selling titles that didn't come directly from Nintendo was Minecraft and so for the fourth

2899
04:33:47,340 --> 04:33:53,420
generation in a row Nintendo's console was the worst place to be for third party games and this

2900
04:33:53,420 --> 04:33:59,500
time the problem was bigger than ever. Nintendo designed the Wii U as a system that would appeal

2901
04:33:59,500 --> 04:34:05,260
to both casual and core audiences but with little third party support and few games which made

2902
04:34:05,260 --> 04:34:11,020
interesting use of the controller the Wii U failed to pull in many core gamers and with confusing

2903
04:34:11,020 --> 04:34:16,460
marketing a high price and the lack of a strong new gimmick it failed to replicate the Wii success

2904
04:34:16,460 --> 04:34:24,140
with casual gamers and so the Wii U was a complete failure and dumped Nintendo firmly into last place

2905
04:34:24,140 --> 04:34:31,100
as soon as its competitors arrived. But as disappointing for Nintendo as this must have been

2906
04:34:31,100 --> 04:34:36,220
at least they could soon console themselves but they weren't the only one who dropped the ball

2907
04:34:36,220 --> 04:34:40,780
in the eighth generation. Introducing Xbox One.

2908
04:35:06,780 --> 04:35:31,580
To understand how the eighth generation was won you have to keep in mind what had been happening

2909
04:35:31,580 --> 04:35:36,860
leading up to it. The biggest trends over the last five or six years had been the success of

2910
04:35:36,860 --> 04:35:42,540
the Wii and motion control, the huge growth in the mobile market and call of duty continuing

2911
04:35:42,540 --> 04:35:49,180
to break every sales record under the sun. People may not have admitted it but the truth was core

2912
04:35:49,180 --> 04:35:55,020
gamers were starting to feel like they were being forgotten. The industry was growing but it was

2913
04:35:55,020 --> 04:35:59,340
growing away from what made many people like games in the first place and the only thing big

2914
04:35:59,340 --> 04:36:04,380
company seemed to care about now was finding new ways to reach the more lucrative casual market.

2915
04:36:05,660 --> 04:36:11,260
And so as the next generation was about to be revealed there was never a more important moment

2916
04:36:11,260 --> 04:36:19,340
to put the focus squarely back on high quality games. Then came the official Xbox One reveal show

2917
04:36:19,900 --> 04:36:25,100
which was the first look at Microsoft's new system and a moment Xbox fans had been waiting for

2918
04:36:25,100 --> 04:36:35,820
for years and the only thing being mentioned was TV. It took 33 minutes almost all of which was

2919
04:36:35,820 --> 04:36:42,380
focused on TV before a single video game was shown and when it was it was just a highlight reel for

2920
04:36:42,380 --> 04:36:48,620
the next yearly installment of multi-platform EA sports titles. This was followed by the more

2921
04:36:48,620 --> 04:36:56,380
promising Forza 5 then a newly announced confusing game TV show hybrid called Quantum Break and then

2922
04:36:56,380 --> 04:37:02,780
it was back to actual TV coverage. Halo made an appearance as a newly announced TV show,

2923
04:37:03,340 --> 04:37:09,260
Steven Spielberg made an appearance to talk about TV, American football made an appearance as something

2924
04:37:09,260 --> 04:37:14,620
you can apparently watch on TV and then the show finished with Microsoft's biggest reveal.

2925
04:37:15,580 --> 04:37:24,300
Call of Duty will appear on Xbox later that year just as it had for the last six years because

2926
04:37:24,300 --> 04:37:31,660
it was a multi-platform yearly series and then the show was over. This was how Microsoft threw away

2927
04:37:31,660 --> 04:37:38,380
all the goodwill they had slowly built with core audiences over the last 10 years. At a time when

2928
04:37:38,380 --> 04:37:43,180
gamers were worried about how the industry was changing Microsoft used the one moment where

2929
04:37:43,180 --> 04:37:49,660
everyone was watching them to prove that all of people's fears were true. The reception to this

2930
04:37:49,660 --> 04:37:57,260
reveal was universally negative but things would soon get a whole lot worse. Three weeks later at

2931
04:37:57,260 --> 04:38:03,180
E3 2013 Microsoft had one last chance to make a big impression before their system's release

2932
04:38:04,220 --> 04:38:10,300
and the show ended up dominated by news that the Xbox One would be an always online system

2933
04:38:10,300 --> 04:38:14,940
that owners couldn't play games on it without an internet connection but people could no longer

2934
04:38:14,940 --> 04:38:21,260
sell or share used games due to new DRM measures and that the built-in Kinect would be always on,

2935
04:38:21,260 --> 04:38:26,700
watching you, recording your daily activities for storage in Microsoft database in case of any

2936
04:38:26,700 --> 04:38:32,860
future bad behaviour. That last part may have been added more by the public than Microsoft

2937
04:38:32,860 --> 04:38:38,220
themselves and Microsoft were a little unfortunate to be holding their press conference one week

2938
04:38:38,220 --> 04:38:43,260
after Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing unlawful surveillance by global security agencies.

2939
04:38:44,220 --> 04:38:47,820
Still for the most part Microsoft did it to themselves.

2940
04:39:03,260 --> 04:39:07,180
At this point victory was being handed to Sony on a silver platter

2941
04:39:07,180 --> 04:39:11,020
and all they had to do was mention video games a few times

2942
04:39:11,020 --> 04:39:14,300
and remind people that at least they're not Microsoft.

2943
04:39:15,260 --> 04:39:21,500
In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4 were equally focused on

2944
04:39:21,500 --> 04:39:27,820
delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.

2945
04:39:28,700 --> 04:39:34,460
For instance PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PS4 gamers.

2946
04:39:41,340 --> 04:39:42,380
Guess that's a good thing.

2947
04:39:44,780 --> 04:39:50,380
We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.

2948
04:39:50,940 --> 04:39:56,940
Just heard you there. When a gamer buys a PS4 disc they have the rights to use that copy of the game.

2949
04:39:56,940 --> 04:40:03,500
They can trade in the game at retail sell it to another person lend it to a friend or keep it forever.

2950
04:40:15,660 --> 04:40:21,500
In addition PlayStation 4 disc based games don't need to be connected online to play.

2951
04:40:27,340 --> 04:40:39,500
And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.

2952
04:40:41,980 --> 04:40:44,620
Sony's best announcement was still to come however.

2953
04:40:45,260 --> 04:40:51,500
I'm very proud to announce that PlayStation 4 will be available at $399.

2954
04:40:57,660 --> 04:41:04,540
This meant the PlayStation 4 would be $100 cheaper than the Xbox One and it wasn't

2955
04:41:04,540 --> 04:41:10,300
because of less powerful hardware. In fact if anything the PlayStation 4 seemed to be the most

2956
04:41:10,300 --> 04:41:15,980
powerful system. The reason for the Xbox's higher price was the built-in connect device

2957
04:41:15,980 --> 04:41:20,540
a feature but offered several benefits yet was highly disliked by many in gaming communities.

2958
04:41:21,660 --> 04:41:25,580
For Microsoft the reveal and its follow-up were a disaster.

2959
04:41:26,540 --> 04:41:31,180
One week after E3 they announced that the new DRM policy would be scrapped,

2960
04:41:31,180 --> 04:41:35,740
that the system would no longer require an internet connection and that owners would even be allowed

2961
04:41:35,740 --> 04:41:41,820
to unplug the connect and still use the console. President of Microsoft's interactive entertainment

2962
04:41:41,820 --> 04:41:47,420
business Von Matrick departed shortly after but by this point the damage was already done

2963
04:41:47,420 --> 04:41:53,980
and the high price still remained. In November 2013 both consoles released to the public with

2964
04:41:54,060 --> 04:41:59,980
the PlayStation 4 quickly selling out. By the end of the year it had sold 1.2 million more units

2965
04:41:59,980 --> 04:42:05,820
than the Xbox One and with time this lead grew until in 2015 Microsoft announced that they would

2966
04:42:05,820 --> 04:42:11,340
no longer be publishing sales figures. Microsoft may have hoped that after the release of the

2967
04:42:11,340 --> 04:42:17,180
Xbox One their reputation might improve due to the quality of the system but unfortunately for them

2968
04:42:17,180 --> 04:42:22,700
this too was not to be because while the two consoles were similar in specs and architecture

2969
04:42:22,700 --> 04:42:27,260
it was the PlayStation 4 which seemed to have the edge and was consistently performing better

2970
04:42:27,260 --> 04:42:32,700
when it came to multi-platform games. For Microsoft there was little they could do but

2971
04:42:32,700 --> 04:42:42,220
dig in repair their damaged reputation and prepare for the future. At E3 2014 they revealed a $399

2972
04:42:42,220 --> 04:42:47,900
connect free version of the console to bring the system in line with the PlayStation. The TV focused

2973
04:42:47,900 --> 04:42:53,260
Xbox entertainment studios was also closed later that year and focus for the future shifted

2974
04:42:53,260 --> 04:42:59,020
more towards video games with Microsoft purchasing several studios including Mojang the creators

2975
04:42:59,020 --> 04:43:03,900
of Minecraft which Microsoft continued to allow on Sony systems in what they hoped would be seen

2976
04:43:03,900 --> 04:43:11,100
as a pro consumer move. For Sony their lead over both Microsoft and Nintendo never seemed to be

2977
04:43:11,100 --> 04:43:17,180
any doubt and while in time Microsoft did succeed at distancing themselves from past controversies

2978
04:43:17,180 --> 04:43:21,980
the PlayStation 4 continued to be a well-received and well-liked system that offered a far more

2979
04:43:21,980 --> 04:43:29,660
impressive list of exclusive titles. This lineup was admittedly slow to get going but later included

2980
04:43:29,660 --> 04:43:37,020
Marvel's Spider-Man, God of War, Uncharted 4, The Last of Us Part 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghosts of

2981
04:43:37,020 --> 04:43:44,380
Tsushima, Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Bloodborne. Meanwhile the Xbox One had few highly reviewed

2982
04:43:44,380 --> 04:43:51,500
exclusives outside of Halo, Years of War and Forza. Still by this point exclusive titles played a much

2983
04:43:51,500 --> 04:43:56,060
smaller role in determining a console's fate than they had in the past with most games being

2984
04:43:56,060 --> 04:44:01,740
multi-platform and with console exclusives increasingly being released on PC by all parties

2985
04:44:01,740 --> 04:44:08,540
except Nintendo. There can be no mistake however that the PlayStation 4 won the eighth generation.

2986
04:44:09,260 --> 04:44:15,980
The most recent sales figures show that Sony's system sold over 117 million units which is more

2987
04:44:15,980 --> 04:44:23,660
than twice as many as the Xbox One and vastly more than the 13.5 million of the Wii U. For Nintendo

2988
04:44:23,660 --> 04:44:29,740
the battle was lost before it even began. For Microsoft, inferior multi-platform performance,

2989
04:44:29,740 --> 04:44:34,220
few exclusives and a higher launch price are what ultimately doomed the Xbox One

2990
04:44:34,220 --> 04:44:39,340
although the damage done by the poor handling of the initial reveal and the heavy focus on TV

2991
04:44:39,340 --> 04:44:42,700
made sure that the system got off to the worst possible start.

2992
04:44:44,380 --> 04:44:49,740
Microsoft had found some success at targeting casual audiences with the release of the Kinect in

2993
04:44:49,740 --> 04:44:55,420
2010 and they presumably hoped to continue this by including the Kinect with their new console and

2994
04:44:55,420 --> 04:45:01,660
focusing heavily on multimedia. We wanted to bring new audiences into Xbox. People that were outside

2995
04:45:01,660 --> 04:45:05,980
of what traditionally was thought of as our core gaming audience that was really the intent at the time.

2996
04:45:06,620 --> 04:45:11,820
Within the company there's always a sense of do more and grow but I think Don was looking for like

2997
04:45:11,820 --> 04:45:18,140
what's that next big leap after Kinect and I think there was a sense that TV could be that thing.

2998
04:45:18,140 --> 04:45:22,460
Like Nintendo finding that the Wii U had to compete with real tablets though,

2999
04:45:22,460 --> 04:45:28,060
smart TVs were also readily available by the time the Xbox One launched which made much of the

3000
04:45:28,060 --> 04:45:34,060
system's multimedia utility less impressive. Their biggest mistake however was simply failing

3001
04:45:34,060 --> 04:45:40,460
to consider their core audience when designing their system and marketing it. If they'd focused on

3002
04:45:40,460 --> 04:45:45,980
TV in addition to video games the reaction wouldn't have been so negative but instead

3003
04:45:45,980 --> 04:45:51,980
all they had to show alongside their TV related announcements were anti-consumer features like

3004
04:45:51,980 --> 04:45:58,380
Always Online and DRM and a high price that was a result of a feature most people didn't even want.

3005
04:45:59,820 --> 04:46:05,340
When gamers were worried about being abandoned by the industry Microsoft did exactly that

3006
04:46:05,980 --> 04:46:14,860
and it cost them. Still like others before them Microsoft and Nintendo were down but not out

3007
04:46:14,860 --> 04:46:20,300
and things do change quickly in gaming as the rest of the industry was making clear.

3008
04:46:22,940 --> 04:46:31,900
When the DS and PSP went head to head in the mid-2000s Nintendo was the clear winner but the

3009
04:46:31,900 --> 04:46:36,860
PlayStation portable was far from a failure and as the next generation of handhelds was revealed

3010
04:46:36,860 --> 04:46:42,460
at the start of the 2010s it looked like history might repeat with both companies sticking to a

3011
04:46:42,460 --> 04:46:48,860
similar approach. Sony doubled down on power boasting of near PlayStation 3 level graphics

3012
04:46:48,940 --> 04:46:54,540
and Nintendo introduced a new unique feature to complement their dual screen design by way of

3013
04:46:54,540 --> 04:47:01,740
stereoscopic 3D. This is something Nintendo had been flirting with for years. First with the Japan

3014
04:47:01,740 --> 04:47:08,620
only Famicom 3D system in the 80s then with the universally panned virtual boy in the 90s and even

3015
04:47:08,620 --> 04:47:15,900
with an unreleased LCD attachment for the GameCube in the early 2000s. This time however 3D was the

3016
04:47:15,900 --> 04:47:21,340
main attraction and with a relatively low cost and no need for additional glasses it was a feature

3017
04:47:21,340 --> 04:47:31,420
that got people talking. The Nintendo 3DS released in March 2011 for $250. Reviews were positive

3018
04:47:31,420 --> 04:47:36,380
with praise given to the addition of a new circle pad analog controller, backwards compatibility

3019
04:47:36,380 --> 04:47:42,140
with DS games and the improved user interface while criticism was directed towards low battery life.

3020
04:47:43,100 --> 04:47:48,860
The main talking point though was unsurprisingly the 3D effect with reactions varying widely

3021
04:47:48,860 --> 04:47:54,860
and these reactions were more important than usual as the 3D effect didn't pick up on camera making

3022
04:47:54,860 --> 04:48:01,020
it hard for Nintendo to show off. Still some people were blown away by the effect, some saw it as

3023
04:48:01,020 --> 04:48:07,820
nothing but a gimmick and some complained about it inducing nausea and headaches. It also required

3024
04:48:07,900 --> 04:48:13,500
rather precise positioning of the system or the effect with blur which was a little impractical

3025
04:48:13,500 --> 04:48:20,220
for a handheld device. The 3D effect did at least make the system stand out to something new but

3026
04:48:20,220 --> 04:48:25,660
in the end this didn't translate well to sales with Nintendo struggling to sell many units outside

3027
04:48:25,660 --> 04:48:33,180
Japan leading to a surprise price cut of $70 only four months after launch. After this sales increased

3028
04:48:33,180 --> 04:48:37,980
but it was a significant sacrifice for Nintendo to make just to get the device off the ground.

3029
04:48:39,260 --> 04:48:44,780
The PlayStation Beta on the other hand launched at the end of 2011 in Japan and in February 2012

3030
04:48:44,780 --> 04:48:51,900
outside Japan meaning it took almost one year longer to release than its rival. Its price of $250

3031
04:48:51,900 --> 04:48:58,860
put it in line with the 3DS's launch price but behind its updated price. Reviews for Sony system

3032
04:48:58,860 --> 04:49:05,740
were also positive with the improved performance, impressive display, rear touchpad and second analog

3033
04:49:05,740 --> 04:49:10,460
stick all helping to make the system stand out as a significant step up from the original PlayStation

3034
04:49:10,460 --> 04:49:16,860
portable. The main criticism was the memory card requirements which created an additional and

3035
04:49:16,860 --> 04:49:21,420
necessary further cost that was made worse by the fact that only Sony brand memory cards worked

3036
04:49:21,420 --> 04:49:27,100
with the device meaning users had no choice but to buy Sony's expensive cards even if they already

3037
04:49:27,100 --> 04:49:33,100
owned other memory cards. Still the Vita did its best to get off to a strong start and boasted a

3038
04:49:33,100 --> 04:49:38,700
relatively big launch lineup of 25 titles which was more than most consoles or handhelds in this

3039
04:49:38,700 --> 04:49:47,260
era. Those games included Uncharted Golden Abyss, Wipeout 2048, FIFA 12 and Rayman Origins.

3040
04:49:48,300 --> 04:49:52,540
The Vita's first year would also see more major releases such as Little Big Planet,

3041
04:49:52,540 --> 04:49:59,100
Persona 4 Golden, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation and Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified as Sony

3042
04:49:59,100 --> 04:50:04,700
tried hard to establish the system's reputation with core gamers. At first this looked like it

3043
04:50:04,700 --> 04:50:10,220
might work with the Vita seeing promising sales at launch but these numbers soon declined and by

3044
04:50:10,220 --> 04:50:18,300
the end of 2012 it had only sold 4 million units well below Sony's expectations and with slow sales

3045
04:50:18,300 --> 04:50:22,940
came a loss of interest from many third-party studios causing Sony to abandon their strategy

3046
04:50:22,940 --> 04:50:27,980
of trying to sell the system through big releases and instead adopt a more indie-centric approach

3047
04:50:27,980 --> 04:50:32,780
where they reached out to mobile and PC developers to try to bring as many promising smaller titles

3048
04:50:32,780 --> 04:50:39,980
to the platform as possible. In August 2013 Sony also dropped the price by $50 alongside a reduction

3049
04:50:39,980 --> 04:50:44,780
in memory cards and in conjunction with the more successful indie focus and the system's strong

3050
04:50:44,780 --> 04:50:51,180
sales in Japan the Vita was able to survive but it never came close to matching its predecessor

3051
04:50:51,180 --> 04:50:58,620
or the 3DS. As for Nintendo they would launch an updated 3DS Excel model in summer 2012 followed

3052
04:50:58,620 --> 04:51:04,220
by a model without the 3D display named the 2DS one year later followed by a new more powerful

3053
04:51:04,220 --> 04:51:11,580
version called the New 3DS in late 2014. Alongside Nintendo's characteristic strong first-party

3054
04:51:11,580 --> 04:51:16,940
lineup and decent third-party support from companies like Square Enix, Konami and Capcom

3055
04:51:16,940 --> 04:51:21,900
this helped keep sales far beyond the Vita. The 3DS would even see the release of a new

3056
04:51:21,900 --> 04:51:26,300
Monster Hunter game from Capcom which had long been one of the PSP's best-selling series.

3057
04:51:27,340 --> 04:51:33,500
Still as dominant as the 3DS was over the Vita it still fell far short of the original DS

3058
04:51:33,500 --> 04:51:41,180
with less than half of its total lifetime sales. The reality was that both the 3DS and Vita were

3059
04:51:41,180 --> 04:51:47,020
solid handheld devices that made significant improvements on their predecessors. The 3DS's

3060
04:51:47,020 --> 04:51:52,220
much-tounted 3D struggled to prove its value in the long term with many players simply turning

3061
04:51:52,220 --> 04:51:56,700
it off for most games once the novelty wore off and the Vita shot itself in the foot with

3062
04:51:56,700 --> 04:52:02,140
how it handled memory cards but in a different era it's easy to imagine both systems finding

3063
04:52:02,140 --> 04:52:08,940
strong commercial success. Still in the end it wasn't a different era and in the 2010s the

3064
04:52:09,020 --> 04:52:13,100
3DS and Vita combined wouldn't even come close to matching the mobile market.

3065
04:52:14,300 --> 04:52:18,380
The harsh reality was that in a world where most people already had smartphones

3066
04:52:18,380 --> 04:52:25,660
dedicated handhelds simply seemed to have too much competition and so for Sony and Nintendo

3067
04:52:25,660 --> 04:52:32,140
this would be the final handheld generation. Nintendo dominated the handheld market for decades

3068
04:52:32,140 --> 04:52:36,620
often with a staggering market share but nothing lasts forever.

3069
04:52:37,260 --> 04:52:42,540
As for mobile gaming it revealed an entirely different side of the industry

3070
04:52:42,540 --> 04:52:47,340
one with different monetization models, different games and different dominant regions.

3071
04:52:48,380 --> 04:52:53,020
For most observers of this the biggest takeaway was the industry's size and growth.

3072
04:52:54,140 --> 04:52:59,740
At the start of the 2010s the mobile industry was still well behind consoles or PC but as the

3073
04:52:59,740 --> 04:53:05,340
decade continued it soon caught up and by the decade's end it was considerably larger than

3074
04:53:05,340 --> 04:53:12,620
all other types of gaming combined. Most mobile games made money through in-app purchases or in-app

3075
04:53:12,620 --> 04:53:17,740
advertising rather than the more traditional buy-to-play model and the amount of money individual

3076
04:53:17,740 --> 04:53:25,020
games could make was staggering. The game with the highest revenue was Arena of Valor also known as

3077
04:53:25,020 --> 04:53:31,260
Honor of Kings in China which is a MOBA made by Chinese gaming giant Tencent that's brought in

3078
04:53:31,260 --> 04:53:40,540
over $14.6 billion since its release in 2015. If numbers that large seem a bit abstract to you

3079
04:53:40,540 --> 04:53:46,780
I like to use the currency called the Bethesda. Microsoft bought Bethesda and the IPs for $7.5

3080
04:53:46,780 --> 04:53:54,220
billion so Arena of Valor's revenue is about 2 Bethesdas. Other high grossing mobile games of

3081
04:53:54,220 --> 04:54:01,100
the decade include the RPG physics game hybrid Monster Strike, Supercell's fantasy themed strategy

3082
04:54:01,100 --> 04:54:08,300
game Clash of Clans, the Battle Royale focused PUBG Mobile, the match 3 RPG hybrid Puzzle and

3083
04:54:08,300 --> 04:54:15,900
Dragons, the more traditional match 3 game Candy Crush Saga and Pokemon Go, an augmented reality

3084
04:54:15,900 --> 04:54:20,300
based Pokemon game from Neantic that received a lot of mainstream attention during its release in

3085
04:54:20,300 --> 04:54:28,540
2016 for its unparalleled ability at making gamers touch grass. It also caused Nintendo's stock to

3086
04:54:28,540 --> 04:54:35,980
increase by 50% in the space of a week. It can be difficult to talk about mobile games without the

3087
04:54:35,980 --> 04:54:41,260
conversation eventually leading back to money whether it's the growth of the industry, the revenue

3088
04:54:41,260 --> 04:54:47,260
of individual games or the methods of monetization that are commonly used. Still for many people

3089
04:54:47,260 --> 04:54:51,420
mobile gaming is about the convenience of games that can be played in short bursts

3090
04:54:51,420 --> 04:54:57,660
wherever you happen to be with little barrier of entry. As the industry is growing to be so large

3091
04:54:57,660 --> 04:55:02,380
it's developed a lot of choice and diversity and as smartphones have continued to become more

3092
04:55:02,380 --> 04:55:07,820
powerful what can be achieved on them has increased at the same time. In the end though

3093
04:55:07,820 --> 04:55:12,780
regardless of people's various opinions on mobile gaming it's impossible to deny the industry

3094
04:55:12,780 --> 04:55:18,780
significance particularly as the trends seen in the mobile industry would soon make their way into

3095
04:55:18,780 --> 04:55:29,900
the gaming mainstream. Online gaming has been steadily growing since the early 90s and the

3096
04:55:29,900 --> 04:55:36,380
2010s were no exception. What would change this decade though was the way online games made money.

3097
04:55:37,580 --> 04:55:42,540
World of Warcraft was a hugely important game not just because it had 12 million active players

3098
04:55:42,540 --> 04:55:46,620
but because those 12 million players were each paying a monthly subscription fee.

3099
04:55:47,660 --> 04:55:52,940
Compared to a more traditional one-time purchase monthly fees were massive but when it came to

3100
04:55:52,940 --> 04:56:00,140
further monetization this was only the beginning. The one-time purchase business model didn't fit

3101
04:56:00,140 --> 04:56:05,820
well with online games that were being continually updated and emphasized long-term engagement and

3102
04:56:05,820 --> 04:56:12,460
so change was inevitable. One of the earliest and most significant examples was Team Fortress 2

3103
04:56:13,020 --> 04:56:16,860
which maintained a steady active player base after its release in 2007

3104
04:56:16,860 --> 04:56:23,340
while receiving regular free updates adding additional content. In 2010 one such update

3105
04:56:23,340 --> 04:56:29,900
allowed players to buy and sell in-game items like hats and the game's revenue immediately

3106
04:56:29,900 --> 04:56:36,460
quadrupled. In 2011 the game was updated to be completely free to play as revenue from

3107
04:56:36,460 --> 04:56:41,820
in-game transactions had come to far exceed those of people purchasing the game and after

3108
04:56:41,820 --> 04:56:48,220
Team Fortress 2 went free to play revenue went up again and the industry took notice.

3109
04:56:49,660 --> 04:56:54,220
At the same time as this new online games like League of Legends were also starting to draw

3110
04:56:54,220 --> 04:56:59,740
in lots of players while making a big profit. League of Legends was also free to play and

3111
04:56:59,740 --> 04:57:05,980
made money through cosmetic skins and purchasable champions. Players could acquire these champions

3112
04:57:05,980 --> 04:57:10,700
through slowly earning in-game currency as they played but many would choose to purchase them

3113
04:57:10,700 --> 04:57:15,180
for real money with more champions and skins being added over time to ensure there was always

3114
04:57:15,180 --> 04:57:21,340
something new to buy. At the time this business model was largely praised with the free to play

3115
04:57:21,340 --> 04:57:26,700
aspect helping the player base grow and the earnable in-game currency providing an alternative

3116
04:57:26,700 --> 04:57:32,780
to needing to spend real money. Of course players did still spend money and as the game's highly

3117
04:57:32,780 --> 04:57:38,300
competitive nature ensured strong replayability the player base grew and grew alongside the game's

3118
04:57:38,300 --> 04:57:43,740
revenue as League of Legends became one of the most played and most successful games of all time.

3119
04:57:45,100 --> 04:57:49,340
Still changing monetization wasn't exclusive to multiplayer games.

3120
04:57:50,860 --> 04:57:56,460
Once upon a time arcade games made big money by making gamers pay to play but some games went

3121
04:57:56,460 --> 04:58:01,820
even further like Double Dragon 3 which featured an in-game shop where players could purchase a

3122
04:58:01,820 --> 04:58:08,860
range of items including new characters weapons and power-ups. This was widely criticized and

3123
04:58:08,860 --> 04:58:14,860
arcades eventually lost popularity making the one-time purchase model of non-arcade games even more

3124
04:58:14,860 --> 04:58:20,860
standard. Older PC games did often sell physical expansion packs that added additional content

3125
04:58:20,860 --> 04:58:26,460
at less than full price and these were generally regarded quite positively as a fair way to expand

3126
04:58:26,460 --> 04:58:32,940
existing games. Things advanced with the arrival of Xbox Live where some games started to provide

3127
04:58:32,940 --> 04:58:39,100
bonus downloadable content usually for free. The Xbox Live marketplace been evolved with

3128
04:58:39,100 --> 04:58:45,180
launch of the 360 and soon featured small pieces of downloadable content at small costs with one

3129
04:58:45,180 --> 04:58:50,300
of the most infamous being the two and a half dollar cosmetic horse armor in the Elder Scrolls 4

3130
04:58:50,300 --> 04:58:57,020
Oblivion. A similar practice was later adopted by Sony and Nintendo at the same time but music

3131
04:58:57,020 --> 04:59:02,460
games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band were gaining popularity while making purchaseable downloadable

3132
04:59:02,460 --> 04:59:10,460
songs a core part of their business model and so smaller or micro transactions were introduced

3133
04:59:10,460 --> 04:59:17,420
to multi and single player games alike. Electronic Arts also introduced micro transactions via in-game

3134
04:59:17,420 --> 04:59:24,300
stores into several existing series like The Sims with its third entry. EA would then add a form

3135
04:59:24,300 --> 04:59:30,540
of luck based micro transaction in the 2009 edition of FIFA something that is now commonly referred

3136
04:59:30,540 --> 04:59:37,100
to as loot boxes. Loot boxes would go on to be added to many other popular online games including

3137
04:59:37,100 --> 04:59:45,900
Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, Battlefield, Call of Duty, League of Legends and more. In 2011

3138
04:59:45,900 --> 04:59:51,180
Rockstar pioneered a new approach by selling content that didn't exist yet in the form of a

3139
04:59:51,180 --> 04:59:57,980
Rockstar pass that could be purchased to unlock future content. Other games like Mortal Kombat and

3140
04:59:57,980 --> 05:00:03,980
Call of Duty soon adopted this season pass approach as well and in Call of Duty this would split the

3141
05:00:03,980 --> 05:00:11,900
player base between those with the season pass maps and those without. In 2012 Capcom's Street Fighter

3142
05:00:11,900 --> 05:00:17,180
tech and crossover drew criticism after including future DLC files on the game's physical disc.

3143
05:00:18,060 --> 05:00:24,060
While in 2013 Dead Space 3 again from EA became one of the first single player focused games to

3144
05:00:24,060 --> 05:00:31,180
offer a purchasable weapon and resource pack to assist players in its campaign. Later games like

3145
05:00:31,180 --> 05:00:36,460
Assassin's Creed Origins from Ubisoft and Middle Earth Shadow of War from Warner Bros would take

3146
05:00:36,460 --> 05:00:43,100
paid advantages in campaigns significantly further and in time microtransactions, in-game stores,

3147
05:00:43,100 --> 05:00:49,820
loot boxes and season passes would all become common practice in many big budget games. Although

3148
05:00:49,820 --> 05:00:55,900
often not without criticism from players, the media and even governmental regulators who have

3149
05:00:55,900 --> 05:01:00,540
likened loot boxes to gambling and raised concerns over their potential harmful impacts.

3150
05:01:02,220 --> 05:01:05,980
Meanwhile gaming companies have often sought to defend these additions by claiming that their

3151
05:01:05,980 --> 05:01:10,780
only providing players with more choice and that increases in video game budgets have occurred

3152
05:01:10,780 --> 05:01:16,220
over time while game prices have stayed relatively flat, meaning further monetization methods have

3153
05:01:16,220 --> 05:01:23,260
become necessary. Still regardless of whether any necessity does truly exist, more monetization

3154
05:01:23,260 --> 05:01:30,300
means more money and businesses don't usually turn down a chance for extra profit. As single

3155
05:01:30,380 --> 05:01:36,380
player focused games are less monetizable, a trend also began towards games as a service,

3156
05:01:36,380 --> 05:01:42,780
or live service games, where AAA games tried to expand into online areas or just placed increased

3157
05:01:42,780 --> 05:01:49,660
focus on future content updates to create continuous engagement from players. The king of live service

3158
05:01:49,660 --> 05:01:55,980
games is unquestionably Grand Theft Auto V, which continued Rockstar's tradition of high quality

3159
05:01:55,980 --> 05:02:01,980
and universally acclaimed open world titles in 2013, but then took things a step further with

3160
05:02:01,980 --> 05:02:09,500
Grand Theft Auto Online. GTA Online allows up to 30 players to freely roam GTA V's world

3161
05:02:09,500 --> 05:02:15,020
while completing lobby-based missions and earning experience points with a focus on general progression,

3162
05:02:15,740 --> 05:02:20,460
and while it did originally have a rocky launch, it soon went on to be hugely successful.

3163
05:02:20,940 --> 05:02:25,900
When Grand Theft Auto V released, it easily surpassed Call of Duty's sales records,

3164
05:02:25,900 --> 05:02:33,660
selling 11.2 million copies in its first 24 hours. Unlike so many of the best selling games before

3165
05:02:33,660 --> 05:02:39,980
it, however, Grand Theft Auto V continued to put out impressive sales figures year after year after

3166
05:02:39,980 --> 05:02:47,020
year. This was partly because of future releases on next-gen consoles and PC, but it was also because

3167
05:02:47,020 --> 05:02:55,180
of the impact and enduring popularity of Grand Theft Auto Online. And so, the gaming industry

3168
05:02:55,180 --> 05:03:01,020
saw how blockbuster single player games could be transformed into blockbuster live service games,

3169
05:03:01,580 --> 05:03:06,460
where they could not only continue to sell more copies due to staying relevant for longer,

3170
05:03:06,460 --> 05:03:11,500
but could also tap into the unbelievably lucrative territory of multiplayer-fuelled

3171
05:03:11,820 --> 05:03:18,620
microtransactions. One year after GTA V, Bungie released their new online-focused first-person

3172
05:03:18,620 --> 05:03:23,020
shooter Destiny, which combined elements of the MMO genre with FPS gameplay.

3173
05:03:24,140 --> 05:03:29,020
Destiny was also very profitable, with publisher Activision claiming it was the most successful

3174
05:03:29,020 --> 05:03:35,420
new gaming franchise launch in history, and between the success of GTA Online and Destiny,

3175
05:03:35,420 --> 05:03:39,180
the live service trend was established and proven beyond doubt.

3176
05:03:40,300 --> 05:03:44,460
Others would soon follow, including several developers that have previously built reputations

3177
05:03:44,460 --> 05:03:51,260
around creating single player games, such as Bioware with Anthem, Bethesda with Fallout 76,

3178
05:03:51,260 --> 05:03:57,900
and Crystal Dynamics with Marvel Avengers. Clearly, not every live service game was a success,

3179
05:03:57,900 --> 05:04:02,620
but for the biggest publishers in the industry, live service offered the biggest rewards,

3180
05:04:02,620 --> 05:04:06,860
and the trend towards live service games is still very much alive today.

3181
05:04:08,300 --> 05:04:13,420
Still, online gaming in the 2010s wasn't just defined by changes to monetization.

3182
05:04:14,460 --> 05:04:18,620
The decade would also see a number of new genres and new takes on existing genres,

3183
05:04:18,620 --> 05:04:25,420
as online gaming expanded upwards and outwards. In 2014, Blizzard's Half Stone achieved major

3184
05:04:25,420 --> 05:04:29,900
success for its accessible and polished take on the digital collectible card game genre.

3185
05:04:30,540 --> 05:04:36,380
In 2015, Rocket League from Xionics combined cars, rockets, and football to create one of

3186
05:04:36,380 --> 05:04:42,060
the decade's freshest sports games. And in 2016, Blizzard's Overwatch received great

3187
05:04:42,060 --> 05:04:47,260
critical acclaim for its team and hero-based FPS design that stood out from most other popular

3188
05:04:47,260 --> 05:04:53,100
shooters at the time. The decade's most popular new genre would come once more from a mod,

3189
05:04:53,660 --> 05:04:58,780
this time from Brendan Green, also known by his online alias, PlayerUnknown,

3190
05:04:58,780 --> 05:05:04,780
who created DayZ Battle Royale, which itself was an offshoot of the DayZ mod for Armor 2.

3191
05:05:06,060 --> 05:05:11,020
Taking inspiration from the Japanese film of the same name, the mod focused on player-vs-player

3192
05:05:11,020 --> 05:05:16,860
combat with a large number of combatants on a big open map. The scale of the map and the

3193
05:05:16,860 --> 05:05:21,500
random placement of weapons was intended to introduce an element of unpredictability,

3194
05:05:21,500 --> 05:05:25,180
and the battleground was designed to get progressively smaller as the games went on

3195
05:05:25,180 --> 05:05:30,860
to ensure regular action. The result turned out to be a hit and would eventually lead to the

3196
05:05:30,860 --> 05:05:37,260
creation of the standalone PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in March 2017 that soon turned Battle

3197
05:05:37,260 --> 05:05:44,220
Royale into a worldwide gaming phenomenon. Seeing the success of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,

3198
05:05:44,220 --> 05:05:49,260
Epic Games decided to create a Battle Royale mod for their upcoming construction shooter hybrid

3199
05:05:49,260 --> 05:05:55,980
Fortnite to create Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017, and between the two games the

3200
05:05:55,980 --> 05:06:02,540
gaming industry was never quite the same again. Fortnite and PUBG offered different takes on

3201
05:06:02,540 --> 05:06:08,860
the same idea, with PUBG being more focused and prioritizing realism, and Fortnite standing out

3202
05:06:08,860 --> 05:06:14,460
thanks to its building mechanics and more cartoony aesthetic. The games would also fare differently

3203
05:06:14,460 --> 05:06:20,060
in different markets, with PUBG being a massive success in Asia and Fortnite finding dominance

3204
05:06:20,060 --> 05:06:26,300
over school yards across America and Europe. Still, one thing both games had in common was

3205
05:06:26,300 --> 05:06:32,460
being staggeringly successful. PUBG quickly broke the record for most concurrent players on Steam

3206
05:06:32,460 --> 05:06:39,260
with over 3.2 million, which was about 2 million more than the next highest game on record, and soon

3207
05:06:39,260 --> 05:06:44,460
Fortnite was able to boast even greater numbers. Many other Battle Royale games followed in their

3208
05:06:44,460 --> 05:06:51,740
wake, some successful, some not, some higher budget, some low, some shooters, some anything but, and

3209
05:06:51,740 --> 05:06:56,540
while most of these would not find long-term popularity, that didn't stop plenty of developers

3210
05:06:56,540 --> 05:07:03,100
from trying anyway. The 2010s were also the decade where online gaming spread beyond games.

3211
05:07:03,340 --> 05:07:08,220
Gaming tournaments had been around for a long time, and by the 90s some were even quite large,

3212
05:07:08,220 --> 05:07:13,900
like the Nintendo World Championships in 1990, or the Evolution Championship Series for fighting

3213
05:07:13,900 --> 05:07:21,580
games starting in 1996. In the 2000s, televised coverage started to be more popular, particularly

3214
05:07:21,580 --> 05:07:26,460
in South Korea, where StarCraft was well on its way to becoming the new national religion.

3215
05:07:26,620 --> 05:07:33,180
In the mid-2000s, esports history was made at EVO 2004, when Daigo Umehara, playing as Ken in

3216
05:07:33,180 --> 05:07:36,780
Street Fighter III, performed the Daigo Parry.

3217
05:07:56,860 --> 05:08:08,780
The 15-hit consecutive parry, with only one pixel of health remaining, into a comeback victory that

3218
05:08:08,780 --> 05:08:14,300
would see Umehara through to the finals, has since been described as the most iconic moment in

3219
05:08:14,300 --> 05:08:20,700
competitive gaming history. It was also a perfect showcase for the potential appeal of esports,

3220
05:08:20,700 --> 05:08:27,900
and by 2010 that potential was quickly becoming reality. New online streaming services opened

3221
05:08:27,900 --> 05:08:33,980
esports to a much wider audience, and with more popularity would come greater prize money and

3222
05:08:33,980 --> 05:08:40,540
bigger stages, as StarCraft, Counter-Strike, League of Legends and Dota all helped push esports into

3223
05:08:40,540 --> 05:08:46,780
the mainstream. With time, more and more games would follow as the numbers kept rising, and by

3224
05:08:46,780 --> 05:08:53,900
2019, Dota 2's The International tournament had a total prize pool of over 34 million dollars,

3225
05:08:53,900 --> 05:09:00,460
and League of Legends 2019 World Championships would see a peak of 44 million concurrent viewers.

3226
05:09:01,820 --> 05:09:05,580
Over the course of the decade, esports became big business,

3227
05:09:05,580 --> 05:09:08,540
but people weren't only watching competitive gaming.

3228
05:09:09,980 --> 05:09:14,220
Livestreaming and Let's Plays, made possible by platforms like Twitch and YouTube,

3229
05:09:14,220 --> 05:09:18,460
also rose to popularity in the first half of the decade, becoming a major new tool for

3230
05:09:18,460 --> 05:09:22,780
video game marketing and drawing great amounts of attention to certain titles.

3231
05:09:23,980 --> 05:09:29,260
Horror games like Amnesia the Dark Descent and Five Nights at Freddy's, or the social

3232
05:09:29,260 --> 05:09:35,500
deduction game Among Us, stand out as examples of how small games with little marketing can still

3233
05:09:35,500 --> 05:09:43,020
have massive impacts through this new online social media-fuelled ecosystem. Social media also

3234
05:09:43,020 --> 05:09:49,340
brought a greater focus to various controversies. Video games and controversy have long been

3235
05:09:49,340 --> 05:09:55,980
acquainted. For example, Mortal Kombat and Night Trap in 1993, Doom following the Columbine shooting

3236
05:09:55,980 --> 05:10:01,740
in 1999, Grand 5th Auto San Andreas following the discovery of the hot coffee mod in 2005,

3237
05:10:02,460 --> 05:10:07,420
Panic over the MMO genre following the success of World Warcraft, and Call of Duty Model

3238
05:10:07,420 --> 05:10:13,980
Morpher 2's Civilian Killing No Russian Mission in 2009 all provide examples of major gaming

3239
05:10:13,980 --> 05:10:20,220
controversies, but all of these past examples had one thing in common, which was that the

3240
05:10:20,220 --> 05:10:27,180
controversy was caused by people outside of the gaming industry looking in. In the 2010s however,

3241
05:10:27,180 --> 05:10:32,540
controversy started coming from within, while becoming more frequent and more intense.

3242
05:10:32,540 --> 05:10:38,700
One of the earliest examples of this was the ending for Mass Effect 3, which fans viewed as

3243
05:10:38,700 --> 05:10:43,420
disappointing for the similarity between different endings and for their failure to represent players'

3244
05:10:43,420 --> 05:10:48,940
choices over the trilogy. The negative response led to an open letter from Bioware's founder,

3245
05:10:49,500 --> 05:10:54,060
charity drives from fans, statements from the Federal Trade Commission and Better Business

3246
05:10:54,060 --> 05:11:01,580
Bureau, a revised extended cut DLC, a significant number of cupcakes, and a disparaging parody

3247
05:11:01,580 --> 05:11:22,380
from Weird Owl. For a disappointing game, this level of negative attention was unprecedented,

3248
05:11:22,380 --> 05:11:25,580
but it turned out this was just a taste of what was to come.

3249
05:11:25,660 --> 05:11:33,340
In 2014, gaming media and gaming communities embraced the political culture war with Gamergate,

3250
05:11:33,340 --> 05:11:36,620
and both have been vigorously arguing about politics ever since.

3251
05:11:37,900 --> 05:11:44,060
But there were also controversies over monetization, like with Middle Earth Shadow of War, Star Wars

3252
05:11:44,060 --> 05:11:50,220
Battlefront 2 and Genshin Impact, controversies over the disappointing state games released in,

3253
05:11:50,220 --> 05:11:57,900
like with No Man's Sky, Fallout 76 and Cyberpunk 2077, controversies over working conditions and

3254
05:11:57,900 --> 05:12:05,100
crunch periods at studios, like with Bioware, Rockstar and Naughty Dog, controversies over sexual

3255
05:12:05,100 --> 05:12:12,780
misconduct, like with Riot Games, Ubisoft and Blizzard, controversies over graphical downgrades,

3256
05:12:12,780 --> 05:12:18,540
controversies over DRM, controversies over lack of accreditation, controversies over lack of

3257
05:12:18,540 --> 05:12:23,340
difficulty options, controversies over games releasing too soon, controversies over games

3258
05:12:23,340 --> 05:12:28,380
releasing too late, controversies over story decisions, controversies over censorship,

3259
05:12:28,380 --> 05:12:33,820
controversies over translations, controversies over voice acting pay, controversies over cameos,

3260
05:12:33,820 --> 05:12:37,980
controversies over original authors, controversies over political representation,

3261
05:12:37,980 --> 05:12:43,580
gender representation, sexual representation, racial representation and religious representation,

3262
05:12:43,580 --> 05:12:48,220
and controversies over controversy and controversies over a lack of controversy,

3263
05:12:48,860 --> 05:12:53,420
and you could probably drag this section out even further if one were so inclined.

3264
05:12:54,700 --> 05:12:59,180
It's worth keeping in mind that for media outlets and online content creators,

3265
05:12:59,180 --> 05:13:03,260
controversy is one of the best ways to make money, and people are willing to do whatever

3266
05:13:03,260 --> 05:13:08,860
they can to encourage it. More surprising though is how much consumers seem to have embraced this

3267
05:13:08,860 --> 05:13:13,740
approach and how difficult it's become to avoid this constant focus on controversy

3268
05:13:13,740 --> 05:13:20,540
within gaming communities as a result. And so, the 2010s were a decade where the internet changed

3269
05:13:20,540 --> 05:13:27,740
many things, and video games were no exception. Still, while not all of these changes were positive,

3270
05:13:27,740 --> 05:13:32,700
the internet did allow for one part of the industry to flourish like never before.

3271
05:13:39,820 --> 05:13:45,820
After major breakthroughs in the 2000s, independent game development continued to thrive in the 2010s.

3272
05:13:46,860 --> 05:13:51,580
This period saw mainstream games growing cost and development time, which often led studios to

3273
05:13:51,580 --> 05:13:56,220
taking increasingly conservative approaches by sticking to proven genres and series.

3274
05:13:57,340 --> 05:14:01,180
Meanwhile, the smaller budgets of indie games meant they only needed a fraction of the sales

3275
05:14:01,180 --> 05:14:05,820
to be profitable, meaning developers could still succeed by appealing to niche audiences

3276
05:14:05,820 --> 05:14:13,420
or through taking greater risks. The result was a huge amount of diversity, from genre to art style,

3277
05:14:13,420 --> 05:14:18,940
to level of accessibility or more, as indie games brought variety at a time when the industry

3278
05:14:18,940 --> 05:14:23,980
needed it the most, which can be shown clearly by looking back through some of the decades most

3279
05:14:23,980 --> 05:14:30,780
critically and commercially successful titles. 2010 saw the release of Playdead's darkly atmospheric

3280
05:14:30,780 --> 05:14:36,940
experiential puzzle game Limbo, and Team Meat's fast-paced and fiendishly difficult 2D platformer

3281
05:14:36,940 --> 05:14:43,020
Super Meat Boy. 2011 would bring a new take on the rogue-like genre with the binding of Isaac,

3282
05:14:43,020 --> 05:14:47,980
which added action gameplay and Zelda-inspired procedurally-generated dungeons as players helped

3283
05:14:47,980 --> 05:14:54,380
Isaac escape his abusive mother. Relogix Terraria also released that year with the expansive 2D

3284
05:14:54,380 --> 05:15:00,220
sandbox game going on to sell 44 million copies, making it one of the best-selling games of all

3285
05:15:00,220 --> 05:15:06,540
time. In 2012, Journey from that game company impressed many with its striking use of visuals,

3286
05:15:06,540 --> 05:15:10,540
audio and non-verbal storytelling that would help it win several Game of the Year awards,

3287
05:15:11,180 --> 05:15:16,860
whereas Deniton Games' top-down shooter Hotline Miami came in hard with a mix of ultraviolence

3288
05:15:16,860 --> 05:15:23,900
and surrealism to provide a somewhat contrasting experience. 2013's Paper's Please from Lucas

3289
05:15:23,900 --> 05:15:28,860
Pope tested players' morality by putting them in the shoes of an immigration inspector at a border

3290
05:15:28,860 --> 05:15:36,700
checkpoint in the glorious dystopia of Aristosca. In 2014, Yacht Club Games 8-bit side-scrolling

3291
05:15:36,700 --> 05:15:42,060
platformer Shovel Knight paid homage to the gaming's past while impressing with cutting-edge controls

3292
05:15:42,060 --> 05:15:49,420
and level design. 2015's Undertale from Toby Fox provided a clever twist on RPG conventions

3293
05:15:49,420 --> 05:15:56,460
and created an enduring fandom alongside one of gaming's greatest soundtracks. In 2016,

3294
05:15:56,460 --> 05:16:00,860
video game players that wanted to avoid going outside were positively spoilt for choice.

3295
05:16:01,500 --> 05:16:06,540
Concerned Ape's Stardew Valley became a sensation for its open-ended and relaxing take on the farming

3296
05:16:06,540 --> 05:16:12,380
sim genre. Plactorio from Woop Software gave players an endlessly deep factory and automation

3297
05:16:12,380 --> 05:16:18,220
simulator while establishing its own genre in the process, and Rimworld from Ludeon Studios

3298
05:16:18,220 --> 05:16:23,420
combined base-building and emergent storytelling in its addictive and relatively accessible take

3299
05:16:23,420 --> 05:16:29,740
on the colony's sim genre. Meanwhile, 2017 seemed determined to test players' skills

3300
05:16:29,740 --> 05:16:36,220
with the demanding and impeccably presented Cuphead from Studio MDHR that had players running,

3301
05:16:36,220 --> 05:16:41,980
gunning and repeatedly dying to its many creative boss fights, and Hollow Knight from Team Cherry,

3302
05:16:41,980 --> 05:16:47,020
an expansive and surprisingly epic Metroidvania that had players take on the role of a nameless

3303
05:16:47,020 --> 05:16:53,980
knight as you explore the Fallen Kingdom of Hallownest. In 2018, Subset Games Into the Breach

3304
05:16:53,980 --> 05:16:59,020
offered strategy fans something new by stripping away much of a genre to place all the focus on

3305
05:16:59,020 --> 05:17:05,980
its rich, tactically engaging turn-based gameplay. 2019 would see the release of Megacrit's much

3306
05:17:05,980 --> 05:17:11,340
copied yet never bested road-like deckbuilder Slay the Spire, as well as Mobius Digital's

3307
05:17:11,340 --> 05:17:16,380
time-loop adventure game Outer Wilds that gave players complete freedom to explore its miniature

3308
05:17:16,380 --> 05:17:23,180
solar system as they unraveled the mysteries of its unforgettable universe. Finally, in 2020,

3309
05:17:23,180 --> 05:17:28,700
Supergiant Games wowed the world with the action-roke like Hades, a game with so much content

3310
05:17:28,700 --> 05:17:33,340
and such high-quality presentation that it almost seems to have left the indie label behind.

3311
05:17:34,780 --> 05:17:39,020
Indie games have come a long way, to the point where the term indie

3312
05:17:39,020 --> 05:17:45,580
increasingly tells you very little. Once upon a time, the word seemed to imply certain characteristics,

3313
05:17:45,580 --> 05:17:51,900
like games that are short, cheap, retro or artsy. Yet, by the end of the decade,

3314
05:17:51,900 --> 05:17:58,300
indie could imply almost anything, with massive companies like Ubisoft, EA and Tencent all creating

3315
05:17:58,300 --> 05:18:03,980
games in traditionally indie styles, all while independent developers increasingly create games

3316
05:18:03,980 --> 05:18:10,700
with a level of ambition, size or presentation comparable to many big-name studios. It's also

3317
05:18:10,700 --> 05:18:14,780
worth noting that there are many other games that could have been mentioned in this section as well,

3318
05:18:14,780 --> 05:18:17,740
and it is a testament to the strength of the indie market,

3319
05:18:17,740 --> 05:18:21,900
just how spoiled the choice you are when looking for high-quality games to highlight.

3320
05:18:23,180 --> 05:18:26,700
Still, the vast number of indie games being developed over the past decade

3321
05:18:26,700 --> 05:18:31,740
became a talking point in itself, with many raising concerns that so many indie games

3322
05:18:31,740 --> 05:18:35,580
makes it harder and harder for indie developers to get noticed and find success.

3323
05:18:36,940 --> 05:18:41,340
As the indie market seemed to be reaching a point of saturation in the later half of the decade,

3324
05:18:41,340 --> 05:18:46,940
the term indie-pocalypse started to be used to refer to this situation, and yet while increased

3325
05:18:46,940 --> 05:18:52,220
competition may have made success harder, there has been no sign of an indie market collapse,

3326
05:18:52,220 --> 05:18:58,780
and good games continue to be released. This continued rise of indie gaming also brought

3327
05:18:58,780 --> 05:19:04,620
a number of related trends. Minecraft paved the way for the concept of early access,

3328
05:19:04,620 --> 05:19:09,100
where many indie games would release unfinished and receive continuous updates over time.

3329
05:19:09,100 --> 05:19:15,260
This helped establish new genres, like survival games, while also aiding developers by assisting

3330
05:19:15,260 --> 05:19:19,500
with funding during development and making it easier to incorporate player feedback.

3331
05:19:20,540 --> 05:19:24,460
The downside of this system was that it could also lead to anti-consumer practices

3332
05:19:24,460 --> 05:19:29,580
of misleading advertising, over-promising, or just abandoning games unfinished after

3333
05:19:29,580 --> 05:19:35,740
receiving players' money. Still, for every standout early access disaster, it's easy to find

3334
05:19:35,740 --> 05:19:42,700
other standout successes. Alongside early access, the 2010s also saw the rise of crowdfunding in

3335
05:19:42,700 --> 05:19:48,540
game development, usually through the platform Kickstarter. This often involved respected

3336
05:19:48,540 --> 05:19:53,500
figures within the industry wanting to bring back classic series or genres that publishers deemed

3337
05:19:53,500 --> 05:19:59,420
too risky to fund, and crowdfunding games could vary between relatively big games from already

3338
05:19:59,500 --> 05:20:03,820
well-established studios to much smaller projects from individual developers.

3339
05:20:05,100 --> 05:20:09,980
With time, many crowdfunded games were released, and amongst them were many of the decades most

3340
05:20:09,980 --> 05:20:15,900
acclaimed indie games, but there were also plenty of notable failures, from MMOs accused of being

3341
05:20:15,900 --> 05:20:21,980
scams to games that critically bombed or just games that never released at all. Through the

3342
05:20:21,980 --> 05:20:27,100
combination of crowdfunding and indie growth, the 2010s would see a lot of genre revivals,

3343
05:20:27,100 --> 05:20:31,660
particularly from those once popular in the past that don't fit well with modern AAA game design.

3344
05:20:32,780 --> 05:20:39,660
These included RTS games, point-and-click adventures, CRPGs, shoot-'em-ups, boomer-shooters,

3345
05:20:39,660 --> 05:20:44,780
space sims, classic survival horror, beat-'em-ups, FMV games, and many more.

3346
05:20:45,900 --> 05:20:51,180
Retro-inspired games in particular saw a resurgence in the 2010s, possibly because people who once

3347
05:20:51,180 --> 05:20:55,900
grew up with older games were now old enough to create games themselves and took inspiration from

3348
05:20:55,900 --> 05:21:01,420
their favourite games of the past, but also because the smaller budgets of indie games fit well

3349
05:21:01,420 --> 05:21:07,420
with retro-inspired design. And developers weren't the only ones making games this decade.

3350
05:21:08,300 --> 05:21:12,620
One of the most played games at the end of the decade, and one of the most confusing for older

3351
05:21:12,620 --> 05:21:18,620
generations, was Roblox, a game creation platform that allows users to share their own games inside

3352
05:21:18,620 --> 05:21:24,540
its engine. Roblox attained great popularity with younger generations, probably as much

3353
05:21:24,540 --> 05:21:31,260
like Minecraft before it, it tapped into players' natural creativity. Finally, the 2010s would also

3354
05:21:31,260 --> 05:21:36,700
see game development go global as indie development and digital distribution opened the industry up

3355
05:21:36,700 --> 05:21:42,140
to more regions around the world. Still, as the ninth generation of consoles finally approached

3356
05:21:42,140 --> 05:21:46,860
in the latter half of the decade, the attention would once more return to Japan.

3357
05:21:55,100 --> 05:22:01,180
No company has more experience in the gaming industry than Nintendo. But in 2012,

3358
05:22:01,180 --> 05:22:06,860
the gaming veteran experienced something new. As for the first time since entering the industry,

3359
05:22:06,940 --> 05:22:14,700
Nintendo would see a financial loss for the year, of $366 million. In 2013,

3360
05:22:14,700 --> 05:22:20,540
they would report similar losses, and in 2014, those losses would grow even greater.

3361
05:22:21,580 --> 05:22:27,020
The Wii U was a failure, but for the first time, Nintendo was starting to fail as well.

3362
05:22:28,460 --> 05:22:33,820
They had never been further behind in the console race. The once reliable handheld market was rapidly

3363
05:22:33,820 --> 05:22:38,860
shrinking, and unlike certain other big names, they didn't have additional areas of business

3364
05:22:38,860 --> 05:22:45,980
outside of gaming. Video games were basically everything to them. And this is the climate in

3365
05:22:45,980 --> 05:22:52,940
which they would create their next and possibly last console. Nintendo's growing desperation

3366
05:22:52,940 --> 05:22:58,700
was visible long before their next console would be ready. In 2014, the company headscrafted a new

3367
05:22:58,700 --> 05:23:04,780
strategy to turn their finances around. A key part of this was to reverse their earliest stance

3368
05:23:04,780 --> 05:23:10,060
on mobile gaming. Originally, Nintendo wanted to preserve the quality of their franchises,

3369
05:23:10,060 --> 05:23:15,340
and continue their practice of only allowing Nintendo games on Nintendo hardware. But now,

3370
05:23:15,340 --> 05:23:20,220
they were looking to enter the mobile market in an attempt to maximize their intellectual property,

3371
05:23:20,860 --> 05:23:26,060
leading to core Nintendo series like Super Mario, Animal Crossing, and Mario Kart,

3372
05:23:26,060 --> 05:23:31,580
making their mobile debuts. This was also the time that Nintendo launched Amiibo,

3373
05:23:31,580 --> 05:23:35,820
a toys to life figure series that had built-in functionality with certain Nintendo games.

3374
05:23:37,020 --> 05:23:42,700
Still, as useful as additional monetization might be, Nintendo still knew the deciding factor would

3375
05:23:42,700 --> 05:23:51,500
always be their next console. So, how do you respond to record losses and your greatest ever failure?

3376
05:23:51,500 --> 05:23:57,580
Well, Nintendo's answer was to double down and try the same thing again.

3377
05:23:58,780 --> 05:24:04,700
And so, once more, Nintendo would avoid competing with their rivals in terms of power. Once more,

3378
05:24:04,700 --> 05:24:09,420
they would focus the console around a portable screen, and once more, they would target the same

3379
05:24:09,420 --> 05:24:14,380
audience with the same intent to bridge the gap between serious and more casual gamers.

3380
05:24:15,740 --> 05:24:20,940
Still, far from creating a Wii U 2, this console would instead learn from the Wii U's mistakes

3381
05:24:20,940 --> 05:24:25,740
and address its greatest shortcomings, providing true portability without needing to stay close

3382
05:24:25,740 --> 05:24:31,180
to a console, as well as better battery life, a more comfortable and versatile design, and of

3383
05:24:31,180 --> 05:24:39,020
course, less confusing marketing. Officially announced in October 2016 after years of fan rumors

3384
05:24:39,020 --> 05:24:44,860
and released in March the following year, the Nintendo Switch was a gamble. By this point,

3385
05:24:44,860 --> 05:24:48,700
many Nintendo fans were sick of being behind the competition in terms of power,

3386
05:24:48,700 --> 05:24:54,620
and were frustrated by Nintendo's continued focus on gimmicks. The Nintendo Switch ignored this.

3387
05:24:55,580 --> 05:24:59,420
Similarly, the Nintendo 3DS, while less successful than its predecessor,

3388
05:24:59,420 --> 05:25:04,300
was still Nintendo's best-selling system at the time, and by creating a new portable device,

3389
05:25:04,300 --> 05:25:09,180
Nintendo were risking competition with their own system, while also combining their two

3390
05:25:09,180 --> 05:25:14,140
main existing revenue streams. What's more, after several disappointing years,

3391
05:25:14,140 --> 05:25:18,140
Nintendo were fast approaching the point where they simply couldn't afford another

3392
05:25:18,140 --> 05:25:23,260
lackluster launch, and following the reveal, plenty of onlookers were expressing doubts.

3393
05:25:24,620 --> 05:25:30,060
But in the end, those doubts would not be founded. The Switch launched strong.

3394
05:25:30,860 --> 05:25:36,620
By the end of March, it had sold 2.74 million units, exceeding Nintendo's expectations.

3395
05:25:37,820 --> 05:25:43,580
Nintendo responded by increasing production capacity. The Switch responded by continuing to sell.

3396
05:25:44,460 --> 05:25:48,700
Nintendo upped their forecast for the financial year, aiming for 10 million units sold,

3397
05:25:48,700 --> 05:25:52,540
and the Switch then upped its sales again, meeting this target with months to spare.

3398
05:25:53,500 --> 05:25:57,500
By the end of its first year, the scale of Nintendo's success was starting to be revealed.

3399
05:25:58,220 --> 05:26:03,580
It would take the Switch less than 12 months to overtake for lifetime sales of the Wii U,

3400
05:26:03,580 --> 05:26:08,300
and in the process, it became the fastest-selling games console in history.

3401
05:26:08,380 --> 05:26:15,020
Things change quickly in the gaming industry, but sometimes they change in your favor.

3402
05:26:16,220 --> 05:26:19,980
There is no single reason for the Switch's record-breaking success,

3403
05:26:19,980 --> 05:26:24,060
and its reception from reviewers was no more positive than the Wii U before it.

3404
05:26:25,100 --> 05:26:29,420
The portability of the system is a clear upgrade from its predecessor, and the Switch may have

3405
05:26:29,420 --> 05:26:34,460
benefited more from a lack of handheld competition, as while smartphones were more common than ever,

3406
05:26:34,540 --> 05:26:38,780
the Switch offered something much more traditional and substantial than mobile gaming did,

3407
05:26:38,780 --> 05:26:40,700
which might have appealed to a different audience.

3408
05:26:41,980 --> 05:26:44,780
It may also have benefited from the failure of the Wii U.

3409
05:26:45,980 --> 05:26:50,540
Nintendo learned from the earlier system's hardware and marketing to make needed improvements

3410
05:26:50,540 --> 05:26:55,420
on their second attempt, and the Wii U's underplayed library also gave Nintendo the

3411
05:26:55,420 --> 05:27:00,220
perfect opportunity to port many of its best games over to their newer system to quickly

3412
05:27:00,220 --> 05:27:03,740
expand the Switch's lineup and ensure the system got off to a strong start.

3413
05:27:04,940 --> 05:27:10,940
And speaking of games, the Switch certainly had its share, including a launch title that

3414
05:27:10,940 --> 05:27:14,620
may have been the first true killer app seen in more than a decade.

3415
05:27:15,660 --> 05:27:20,700
The legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild, is one of the most highly acclaimed games in history.

3416
05:27:21,740 --> 05:27:27,100
By taking Zelda Open World, it gave new life to the Zelda series and the Open World genre,

3417
05:27:27,180 --> 05:27:32,060
with a more hands-off and exploration-driven approach to game design that many felt represented

3418
05:27:32,060 --> 05:27:37,100
what had been lacking from many other games of the modern era. Breath of the Wild was a

3419
05:27:37,100 --> 05:27:42,940
true system seller, and its sales clearly show this, as it accounted for almost 50% of the

3420
05:27:42,940 --> 05:27:47,500
Switch's early software sales, with the game selling nearly one-to-one with the console.

3421
05:27:48,940 --> 05:27:54,060
Launching with a mainline Zelda title, let alone one of the best-received Zelda titles in history,

3422
05:27:54,060 --> 05:27:59,500
is always a significant advantage for a console, but the Switch's first year included more hits

3423
05:27:59,500 --> 05:28:05,100
than just Breath of the Wild. Soon after its release, it would receive its all-time best-selling

3424
05:28:05,100 --> 05:28:11,260
game by way of the ever-popular Mario Kart 8, which was an expanded version of the Wii U title,

3425
05:28:11,260 --> 05:28:15,980
as well as a well-received sequel to third-person territory control game Splatoon,

3426
05:28:15,980 --> 05:28:21,340
and even a new 3D Mario game in Super Mario Odyssey, which gave the Switch

3427
05:28:21,340 --> 05:28:27,420
its second critically adored, must-own title. In a time when consoles were increasingly launching

3428
05:28:27,420 --> 05:28:32,700
with weaker and weaker line-ups, and had less and less exclusive games, the Switch finished its

3429
05:28:32,700 --> 05:28:39,180
first year looking like a true heavyweight, with plenty more still to come. And as the Nintendo

3430
05:28:39,180 --> 05:28:43,500
Switch got off to a great start, it pretty much solved Nintendo's long-running third-party

3431
05:28:43,500 --> 05:28:48,620
support problem, as many developers no longer wanted to miss out on the Switch's larger user base.

3432
05:28:48,860 --> 05:28:55,100
But it wasn't just Nintendo who would have a good year in 2017, and it wasn't just Nintendo

3433
05:28:55,100 --> 05:29:01,420
who needed such a year. After the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in 1985, Japan

3434
05:29:01,420 --> 05:29:07,340
dominated the gaming industry for over 30 years, but as gaming moved to high definition,

3435
05:29:07,340 --> 05:29:13,820
this quickly started to change. More and more of the best-selling and highest-reviewed games

3436
05:29:14,780 --> 05:29:21,020
were coming to be from outside Japan, with major Japanese series like Final Fantasy and Gran Turismo

3437
05:29:21,020 --> 05:29:26,060
seeming to experience longer, more drawn-out development periods and a decline in critical

3438
05:29:26,060 --> 05:29:32,380
and fan reception. In this period, a new trend began of Japanese studios outsourcing established

3439
05:29:32,380 --> 05:29:39,660
franchises to Western developers, something that was once almost unheard of. And this wasn't just

3440
05:29:39,740 --> 05:29:47,020
small unknown series either, it included some big and beloved names like Resident Evil, Silent Hill,

3441
05:29:47,020 --> 05:29:54,780
Devil May Cry, Dead Rising, Castlevania, Contra, and more. The worst part of his trend was that

3442
05:29:54,780 --> 05:29:59,260
almost every one of these games was received far more poorly than the older Japanese-developed

3443
05:29:59,260 --> 05:30:05,100
games of the same series. Meanwhile, other major Japanese publishers like Square Enix would make

3444
05:30:05,180 --> 05:30:10,060
moves to acquire Western-based developers in order to adapt to the changing market demands.

3445
05:30:11,100 --> 05:30:16,220
Konami went even further by going on to abandon games altogether in favour of focusing on

3446
05:30:16,220 --> 05:30:21,980
gambling and the pachinko market, while industry giant Sony shifted their focus far more heavily

3447
05:30:21,980 --> 05:30:28,700
towards Western developers and Western audiences. And this was more than just a change in where

3448
05:30:28,700 --> 05:30:35,820
development was taking place. From 2007 to 2012, the Japanese gaming industry shrank for

3449
05:30:35,820 --> 05:30:42,140
five years in a row, and the only major Japanese developer doing well in this period was Nintendo,

3450
05:30:42,140 --> 05:30:49,260
who were about to release the Wii U. And so, as the Japanese gaming industry stumbled and fell,

3451
05:30:49,260 --> 05:30:54,940
a lot of people started to take notice. The views of the general gaming populace were perhaps best

3452
05:30:54,940 --> 05:31:01,340
summarised by once-popular indie developer Phil Fish when asked what he thought of recent Japanese games.

3453
05:31:24,940 --> 05:31:40,860
As tone-deaf as this might now seem, at the time, Fish really was just saying something many people

3454
05:31:40,860 --> 05:31:46,140
were thinking, and it wasn't just Western developers and journalists. Japanese developers

3455
05:31:46,140 --> 05:31:50,940
were also highly critical, and it's not an exaggeration to say that the Japanese industry

3456
05:31:50,940 --> 05:31:56,060
was experiencing a genuine crisis that was made even more dramatic by how much of a fool from

3457
05:31:56,060 --> 05:32:04,780
grace it seemed to represent. But in 2017, this would finally change, as Japan took back its crown.

3458
05:32:06,300 --> 05:32:12,620
It began before the year even started. At the very end of 2016, two games famous for being stuck in

3459
05:32:12,620 --> 05:32:20,460
development hell finally released. Final Fantasy XV was first shown in 2006. The Last Guardian,

3460
05:32:20,460 --> 05:32:26,380
the next game from the team behind Ico and Shadow of Colossus, was first announced in early 2007.

3461
05:32:27,260 --> 05:32:33,020
Ten years later, after much anticipation, derision and desperation, these games finally made it to

3462
05:32:33,020 --> 05:32:39,260
the public, and both were received positively. But this was only a taste of what was to come.

3463
05:32:39,660 --> 05:32:45,660
January 2017, Resident Evil 7 released two critical acclaim after the previous mainline entry was

3464
05:32:45,660 --> 05:32:51,740
widely panned, and achieved success by returning the series to its survival horror roots. The very

3465
05:32:51,740 --> 05:32:57,180
same day, Yakuza Zero released in the West, becoming the most successful Yakuza game of all time,

3466
05:32:57,180 --> 05:33:03,580
and popularizing the series outside Japan. In February, Neo released ending developer Ninja

3467
05:33:04,540 --> 05:33:08,940
Theory's long run of poorly received titles, and becoming their most highly acclaimed game

3468
05:33:08,940 --> 05:33:15,660
since Ninja Gaiden in 2004. March brought Neo Automata, which released a critical acclaim,

3469
05:33:15,660 --> 05:33:20,700
becoming the first game from beloved oddball game director Yoko Taro to reach mainstream audiences.

3470
05:33:21,500 --> 05:33:26,460
This was the same month that the Nintendo Switch and Breath of the Wild also made their debut.

3471
05:33:27,740 --> 05:33:33,180
April continued with Persona 5, which became the most highly reviewed JRPG since Final Fantasy 9

3472
05:33:33,260 --> 05:33:37,820
in 2000, while also making thousands of people online say the words,

3473
05:33:37,820 --> 05:33:44,060
I don't usually like JRPGs, but... Something worth keeping in mind here is that

3474
05:33:44,060 --> 05:33:50,700
Yakuza Zero, Neo, Neo Automata, and Persona 5 all released as PlayStation exclusives in the first

3475
05:33:50,700 --> 05:34:00,140
half of 2017, all received great reviews, and all sold millions of copies. And yet, at E3 2016,

3476
05:34:00,140 --> 05:34:05,500
Sony wouldn't promote any of these four games. They ended up as some of the best

3477
05:34:05,500 --> 05:34:11,100
PlayStation exclusives in years on a console that was, at the time, light on exclusives,

3478
05:34:11,100 --> 05:34:17,260
and yet Sony had refused to show any of them in favor of focusing on multi-platform games like

3479
05:34:17,260 --> 05:34:24,860
Call of Duty, Modern Warfare Remastered, and LEGO Star Wars, The Force Awakens. This was probably

3480
05:34:24,860 --> 05:34:30,700
because these games simply looked to Japanese, and despite being a Japanese company, Sony seemed

3481
05:34:30,700 --> 05:34:36,460
to decide that showing such Japanese looking games could be bad for their brand. This was the

3482
05:34:36,460 --> 05:34:41,820
situation Japanese games were in, at least this was the situation in the eyes of the biggest

3483
05:34:41,820 --> 05:34:48,940
Japanese games company in the world, until 2017 happened. June brought the triumph in return of

3484
05:34:48,940 --> 05:34:54,300
one of gaming's most iconic fighting series, Tekken, after an 8 year absence. July brought

3485
05:34:54,300 --> 05:34:59,740
the release of Dragon Quest XI, only in Japan and yet Japan alone was enough to reach 5 million copies

3486
05:34:59,740 --> 05:35:05,980
sold. August brought the return of 2D Sonic in Sonic Mania, a game not made by Japanese developers,

3487
05:35:05,980 --> 05:35:10,620
but instead by several Sonic fans, and yet it went on to give the iconic Japanese series its best

3488
05:35:10,620 --> 05:35:15,900
reviewed game since the Dreamcast. September brought the return of Metroid in Samus Returns,

3489
05:35:15,900 --> 05:35:21,660
seven years after the last Metroid game, and 13 years since the last 2D Metroid. October brought

3490
05:35:21,660 --> 05:35:26,220
Super Mario Odyssey, and December rounded the year off with Xenoblade Chronicles 2,

3491
05:35:26,220 --> 05:35:30,300
the best selling game in the long running Xeno series, and another reason for Switch and

3492
05:35:30,300 --> 05:35:36,620
JRPG fans to be happy that year. For video games, some years are better than others,

3493
05:35:36,620 --> 05:35:42,780
and 2017 was without doubt one of the best of the modern era. There were good western and indie

3494
05:35:42,780 --> 05:35:48,220
games released that year as well, but it was Japanese developers who stole the show, and the idea that

3495
05:35:48,220 --> 05:35:54,620
the Japanese games industry was falling behind, or dying, would be permanently dispelled ever since.

3496
05:35:55,820 --> 05:36:00,540
Nintendo and the Switch would find further success in the following years, with major titles like

3497
05:36:00,540 --> 05:36:06,220
Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizon, and many many Pokemon games.

3498
05:36:07,420 --> 05:36:12,620
Still, as the decade reached its end, attention would return once more to the other two major

3499
05:36:12,620 --> 05:36:17,660
giants of gaming as their next generation of consoles were getting ready to finally release.

3500
05:36:18,700 --> 05:36:33,100
The most interesting thing about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X is how uninteresting they are.

3501
05:36:34,140 --> 05:36:38,300
Once upon a time, different gaming consoles were entirely distinct species,

3502
05:36:38,300 --> 05:36:43,340
but look past for deceptively varied exteriors of Sony's and Microsoft's latest efforts,

3503
05:36:43,340 --> 05:36:51,180
and you'll find near identical pieces of hardware. AMD 8 core Zen 2 CPUs, AMD Radeon

3504
05:36:51,180 --> 05:36:57,180
R DNA GPUs, similar SSD drives, similar promises in resolution and frame rate,

3505
05:36:57,180 --> 05:37:01,980
similar backwards compatibility, similar disc and digital only variants,

3506
05:37:01,980 --> 05:37:06,700
similar prices, although the digital only Xbox is cheaper and less powerful,

3507
05:37:06,700 --> 05:37:11,820
and a similar release date, which basically means, unless you're a tech enthusiast,

3508
05:37:11,820 --> 05:37:18,060
a dedicated fanboy or girl, or a paid marketer, there isn't anything important separating the

3509
05:37:18,060 --> 05:37:24,220
two machines at a technical level. The real proof of this is in multi-platform performance,

3510
05:37:25,020 --> 05:37:31,740
where once the 360 beat the PS3, and then the PS4 beat the Xbox One, now there's no clear difference.

3511
05:37:32,700 --> 05:37:36,940
Some games might perform better on one system over the other, but even then the differences

3512
05:37:36,940 --> 05:37:42,700
tend to be small and don't always follow any general rule. This doesn't mean the launch of

3513
05:37:42,700 --> 05:37:47,900
the two systems was uneventful, but even here, events of note had nothing to do with the systems.

3514
05:37:48,940 --> 05:37:54,300
A global pandemic, combined with a global microchip shortage, led to supply issues and stock

3515
05:37:54,300 --> 05:38:00,300
shortages for both companies, which then led to heavy scalping. For what it's worth,

3516
05:38:00,300 --> 05:38:05,260
the PlayStation 5 got scalped harder and would eventually sell more, with recent

3517
05:38:05,260 --> 05:38:13,500
figures putting the PS5 at 30 million units sold to the Xbox's 18.5 million, although even in 2022,

3518
05:38:13,500 --> 05:38:20,060
hardware availability was still a limiting factor. Regardless, even if the console war has turned

3519
05:38:20,060 --> 05:38:24,540
cold, there have still been major developments that will likely shape the future of gaming in

3520
05:38:24,540 --> 05:38:30,700
the years to follow. The first is the emergence of virtual reality headsets, which would see a

3521
05:38:30,700 --> 05:38:36,780
major breakthrough when 18 year old Palmer Lucky had the idea to use cheap lenses in place of older

3522
05:38:36,780 --> 05:38:41,580
expensive lenses and instead tackle the problem of lens distortion through software,

3523
05:38:42,220 --> 05:38:49,020
creating the potential for much lower cost systems. Lucky was joined by John Carmack of Doomfame,

3524
05:38:49,020 --> 05:38:54,860
and together they created the company Oculus VR in 2012, which was then purchased by Facebook

3525
05:38:54,940 --> 05:39:00,060
two years later. Sony and Valve would also start development of their own headsets,

3526
05:39:00,060 --> 05:39:08,220
and in 2016 the Oculus Rift, the Vive from Valve and HTC, and PlayStation VR all launched to the

3527
05:39:08,220 --> 05:39:15,420
public and received a mixed reception. Praise was given to the immersiveness and uniqueness of the

3528
05:39:15,420 --> 05:39:21,580
experience, while criticism focused on the high prices, high latency, the practicality of space

3529
05:39:21,660 --> 05:39:28,060
required, long-term comfort, and the possibility of motion sickness. In time, second generation

3530
05:39:28,060 --> 05:39:33,740
headsets arrived that made significant improvements over their predecessors. The Oculus Quest 1 and 2

3531
05:39:33,740 --> 05:39:39,020
provided standalone headsets that removed the problem of wires. The Valve Index provided

3532
05:39:39,020 --> 05:39:44,140
impressive field of view and resolution while making improvements to comfort, albeit at an

3533
05:39:44,140 --> 05:39:50,140
impressively high price, and recently the PlayStation VR 2 provided a high-end headset

3534
05:39:50,140 --> 05:39:57,020
with an OLED screen and a strong price-to-performance ratio. Seven years after VR headsets first

3535
05:39:57,020 --> 05:40:02,460
arrived, it's become clear that despite their rather lackluster start, VR technology is making

3536
05:40:02,460 --> 05:40:09,340
impressive strides and still getting better every year. That said, truly widespread adoption still

3537
05:40:09,340 --> 05:40:14,620
hasn't happened yet, and the experience provided by VR headsets has so far seemed to be more of an

3538
05:40:14,700 --> 05:40:20,940
adjacent experience to traditional gaming than a replacement. As while VR does allow for completely

3539
05:40:20,940 --> 05:40:26,780
new types of experiences, it also has significant disadvantages, like the limitations of controls

3540
05:40:26,780 --> 05:40:32,860
or long-term comfort that make it a bad fit for some areas of gaming. Still, when it comes to the

3541
05:40:32,860 --> 05:40:38,540
console war, Sony has established themselves as one of the best manufacturers in the VR industry

3542
05:40:38,540 --> 05:40:44,380
and are placing more and more focus on VR games, while Nintendo have mostly stayed away

3543
05:40:44,380 --> 05:40:49,900
and Microsoft has made some big moves in the past but have distanced themselves more recently,

3544
05:40:49,900 --> 05:40:54,700
meaning if VR does become a larger part of the industry, it's Sony who looks like the one who

3545
05:40:54,700 --> 05:41:00,140
benefit the most. And if the rate at which VR technology is improving remains steady,

3546
05:41:00,140 --> 05:41:06,540
it's easy to imagine the VR industry seeing significant growth over the 2020s, as better tech

3547
05:41:06,540 --> 05:41:12,700
leads to more users, which leads to more games, which leads to more users, as the positive feedback

3548
05:41:12,700 --> 05:41:19,420
loop kicks in and VR finally becomes a core part of the industry alongside consoles, PC and mobiles.

3549
05:41:20,940 --> 05:41:26,060
But while Sony might be winning at VR, Microsoft has seen growth in a different area.

3550
05:41:27,420 --> 05:41:32,140
Game streaming has been around since the start of the decade, with companies like OnLive and

3551
05:41:32,140 --> 05:41:37,340
Gaikai offering forms of cloud gaming, a service where you play games on a remote server,

3552
05:41:37,340 --> 05:41:43,500
which is then streamed directly to a user's device. This removes costly hardware requirements,

3553
05:41:43,500 --> 05:41:48,860
but also requires high-speed, low-latency internet connections and substantial data usage.

3554
05:41:50,060 --> 05:41:55,980
Neither OnLive nor Gaikai would turn a profit and both would eventually be acquired by Sony,

3555
05:41:55,980 --> 05:41:59,740
but in time other cloud-based streaming services would appear to take their place.

3556
05:42:00,700 --> 05:42:05,980
Meanwhile, both Sony and Microsoft launched their own game subscription services, PlayStation Now

3557
05:42:05,980 --> 05:42:11,180
and Xbox Game Pass, which would incorporate cloud gaming as well as provide access to a range of

3558
05:42:11,180 --> 05:42:17,580
games that can be played for no additional cost. Of all subscription and streaming-based services,

3559
05:42:17,580 --> 05:42:22,620
Xbox Game Pass has reached the most users, while seeing substantial uptake amongst PC players.

3560
05:42:23,580 --> 05:42:28,140
It seems clear that the plan is to create something like a Netflix for video games,

3561
05:42:28,140 --> 05:42:31,820
however despite heavy investment from Microsoft, they still haven't been able to reach their

3562
05:42:31,820 --> 05:42:37,740
target numbers and are facing a lot of competition from other companies like Amazon and Nvidia.

3563
05:42:39,100 --> 05:42:42,380
The full impact of game subscriptions and streaming remains to be seen.

3564
05:42:43,180 --> 05:42:47,020
Some worry that widespread use of game subscriptions will move games further towards

3565
05:42:47,020 --> 05:42:52,060
additional monetization methods like microtransactions, while widespread use of streaming

3566
05:42:52,060 --> 05:42:57,100
could have an even more substantial impact as it threatens the existence of traditional console

3567
05:42:57,100 --> 05:43:03,100
and PC gaming entirely, particularly in regions where people may already have less disposable income.

3568
05:43:04,380 --> 05:43:08,780
Rumors also currently exist about a cloud gaming handheld device from Sony,

3569
05:43:08,780 --> 05:43:13,340
and it seems possible that cloud gaming will come to play a much greater role in the industry

3570
05:43:13,340 --> 05:43:19,020
in years to come. Game Pass hasn't been Microsoft's only recent investment, however.

3571
05:43:19,740 --> 05:43:23,980
The final trend that seems to be defining the current generation is consolidation.

3572
05:43:23,980 --> 05:43:29,740
When Microsoft announced its acquisition of five smaller studios at E3 2018,

3573
05:43:29,740 --> 05:43:34,940
few questioned the move. Sony had been winning the exclusive war for years and showed no signs

3574
05:43:34,940 --> 05:43:39,740
of stopping, so it made sense that Microsoft would look to acquire talented studios of their own

3575
05:43:39,740 --> 05:43:44,060
to create dedicated first-party titles to help them keep up with the competition.

3576
05:43:45,260 --> 05:43:51,420
Microsoft's acquisitions didn't end at E3 2018, however. First, there were more smaller

3577
05:43:51,420 --> 05:43:55,980
studios announced. Then, there was the more surprising news of a deal to acquire Zenimax in

3578
05:43:55,980 --> 05:44:03,020
2020 for $8.1 billion, which included Bethesda and big-name franchises like The Elder Scrolls and

3579
05:44:03,020 --> 05:44:09,020
Fallout. Then, other large companies seemed to join in with major purchases, like EA acquiring

3580
05:44:09,020 --> 05:44:16,460
Gloomobile for $2.4 billion, Take-Two acquiring Zynga for $12.7 billion, and Sony acquiring Bungie

3581
05:44:16,460 --> 05:44:22,700
for $3.7 billion. Still, the biggest buyer would once again be Microsoft, who announced the deal

3582
05:44:22,700 --> 05:44:30,940
to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in 2022. Activision Blizzard are the largest

3583
05:44:30,940 --> 05:44:38,700
third-party publisher in gaming, and an acquisition of this size is unprecedented. This is different

3584
05:44:38,700 --> 05:44:43,180
to buying talented studios, which is something large gaming companies have been doing for years.

3585
05:44:43,980 --> 05:44:47,660
Instead, this is basically buying a significant chunk of the industry,

3586
05:44:47,660 --> 05:44:53,020
and many, including regulatory bodies and antitrust agencies, have expressed concern

3587
05:44:53,020 --> 05:44:57,340
about the potential negative impacts this may have, with the deal still currently facing

3588
05:44:57,340 --> 05:45:02,300
significant challenge, particularly from the competition and markets authority in the United

3589
05:45:02,300 --> 05:45:06,940
Kingdom. Whether this deal will ultimately go through, though, remains to be seen.

3590
05:45:08,220 --> 05:45:12,620
Microsoft has been quietly losing the console war for years, and most believe

3591
05:45:12,620 --> 05:45:18,060
competition between major gaming companies can only benefit consumers. Yet, whether these moves

3592
05:45:18,060 --> 05:45:23,900
will make the console market more or less competitive is unclear, and this general trend

3593
05:45:23,900 --> 05:45:30,860
towards consolidation certainly raises concerns. Still, this is hardly the only thing people have

3594
05:45:30,860 --> 05:45:46,380
been critical of in recent years. The Romans had a saying that translates to,

3595
05:45:46,380 --> 05:45:51,580
the past is always well remembered, and the Romans weren't alone in this belief.

3596
05:45:52,940 --> 05:45:58,620
Sometimes, however, things really do get worse. So, what about video games?

3597
05:45:59,580 --> 05:46:04,220
Everywhere you look online, you'll find people telling you about how bad games are now,

3598
05:46:04,220 --> 05:46:10,140
and how much better they were in the past, but the internet is also addicted to negativity,

3599
05:46:10,140 --> 05:46:17,660
and people are biased. So, what evidence is there for this belief, and what does gaming's 50 year

3600
05:46:17,660 --> 05:46:25,820
history actually tell us? Well, for one thing, the future does raise concerns, but a worrying

3601
05:46:25,900 --> 05:46:32,940
future isn't anything new. This is an industry of change, and change brings uncertainty.

3602
05:46:33,740 --> 05:46:39,740
The gaming industry has crashed more than once. The console market almost died completely. The

3603
05:46:39,740 --> 05:46:44,780
biggest gaming company in the world went bankrupt. Many other console manufacturers also exited the

3604
05:46:44,780 --> 05:46:50,460
scene. Reliable companies have produced spectacular failures. Established companies have experienced

3605
05:46:50,540 --> 05:46:56,140
tragic deaths. Y2K didn't happen, but multiple stock market crashes did. The most successful

3606
05:46:56,140 --> 05:47:00,540
console of all time was followed by the company's greatest failure, and soon after this, every other

3607
05:47:00,540 --> 05:47:06,060
major player also suffered their greatest failures. Motion controls threatened to take over, PC gaming

3608
05:47:06,060 --> 05:47:10,780
threatened to become irrelevant, mobile gaming threatened to take over, indie gaming threatened

3609
05:47:10,780 --> 05:47:17,180
to become apocalyptic, online gaming threatened to take over, and now, consolidation, monetization,

3610
05:47:17,260 --> 05:47:23,820
and subscription services threaten gaming as we know it. And time will tell how things play out,

3611
05:47:23,820 --> 05:47:29,260
but really, future concerns are a part of the gaming industry, and they always have been.

3612
05:47:30,620 --> 05:47:36,860
So, what about the present? Well, one of the biggest trends in the last 10 years has been a

3613
05:47:36,860 --> 05:47:44,380
growing abundance of remakes, remasters, reboots, and re-releases. On the one hand,

3614
05:47:44,380 --> 05:47:48,940
old games don't always remain accessible, and so attempts to bring them to modern audiences

3615
05:47:48,940 --> 05:47:54,940
makes sense. And as the passage of time creates more old games, it also makes sense that there

3616
05:47:54,940 --> 05:48:00,460
might be more attempts to bring back older classics. This might also be representative

3617
05:48:00,460 --> 05:48:04,780
of the changing demographics of gamers, where there's now a large portion of older people

3618
05:48:04,780 --> 05:48:10,780
nostalgic for the games from their childhood, or younger gamers unwilling or unable to play older

3619
05:48:10,780 --> 05:48:16,620
games who still want a way to feel included. Still, one thing that is hard to justify is the

3620
05:48:16,620 --> 05:48:22,540
low quality of some of these newer additions. There are many remasters and remakes that could

3621
05:48:22,540 --> 05:48:28,700
be criticized, but perhaps the single one most endemic of a bigger problem is Grand Theft Auto,

3622
05:48:28,700 --> 05:48:34,300
The Trilogy, The Definitive Edition, a compilation of three of the best-selling games of the 2000s

3623
05:48:34,300 --> 05:48:39,820
that was published by one of the most respected developers in gaming, and yet, the end result

3624
05:48:39,900 --> 05:48:46,060
was appalling, being buggy, inauthentic, and an all-round visual downgrade, with missing

3625
05:48:46,060 --> 05:48:52,220
animations, sound effects, and textures. The Definitive Edition received one of the lowest

3626
05:48:52,220 --> 05:48:58,540
user scores of all time, and stands as a testament to just how bad an improved addition can be,

3627
05:48:58,540 --> 05:49:03,900
with Rockstar making matters even worse by also removing the original games from stores at the

3628
05:49:03,900 --> 05:49:11,340
same time. So, various re-releases have given companies a lazy and low-cost way to cash in on

3629
05:49:11,340 --> 05:49:17,980
past games. Some remakes do receive considerably more effort, but even these display a deep lack

3630
05:49:17,980 --> 05:49:23,260
of originality as companies are choosing to finance remakes of still readily accessible

3631
05:49:23,260 --> 05:49:29,260
and enjoyable games in place of creating something new, and this practice seems to be becoming more

3632
05:49:29,260 --> 05:49:38,540
common. So far in 2023, 90% of the highest-rated games are remasters and remakes. This is rather

3633
05:49:38,540 --> 05:49:44,300
pathetic, but the high critical ratings and the fact these games continue to sell is proof that

3634
05:49:44,300 --> 05:49:51,420
this is what many people want. One day, attitudes might change, but for now gaming companies just

3635
05:49:51,420 --> 05:49:56,460
seem to be giving the people what they ask for, with the quality varying between attempts.

3636
05:49:57,180 --> 05:50:03,100
Another trend of modern gaming has been additional monetization methods, such as loot boxes and in-game

3637
05:50:03,100 --> 05:50:09,580
cash stores. For the mobile industry and many online games, these have been incredibly effective at

3638
05:50:09,580 --> 05:50:15,420
increasing revenue, and this has come to extend to even some more traditional games, although some

3639
05:50:15,420 --> 05:50:21,340
attempts have been met with considerable backlash. Still, much like with remasters and remakes,

3640
05:50:21,420 --> 05:50:26,140
consumers again have a choice here, both in whether to play these games and whether to spend

3641
05:50:26,140 --> 05:50:31,100
money on these services, and again, many people are making the choices that make additional

3642
05:50:31,100 --> 05:50:37,820
monetization methods profitable. The gaming industry is a business, and if consumers allow it,

3643
05:50:37,820 --> 05:50:45,180
companies will do what makes them the most money. Finally, another obvious trend has been a decline

3644
05:50:45,180 --> 05:50:50,300
in the quality of AAA, with games seeming to take longer to release while taking less

3645
05:50:51,260 --> 05:50:55,660
risks in their design and being more likely to launch unfinished and buggy.

3646
05:50:56,860 --> 05:51:01,180
This is partly because advancements in game technology have slowed over time,

3647
05:51:01,180 --> 05:51:05,660
alongside ever rising game development costs, which has meant graphical upgrades have become

3648
05:51:05,660 --> 05:51:10,780
less noticeable, and impressing gamers through continually creating more spectacular games

3649
05:51:10,780 --> 05:51:17,820
has become harder. As a result, games might be overambitious, or make sacrifices to gameplay

3650
05:51:17,820 --> 05:51:24,060
or design, or take longer to release, or make sacrifices to quality in order to meet deadlines.

3651
05:51:25,180 --> 05:51:29,820
Claiming that AAA games have got worse in recent years seems pretty reasonable though.

3652
05:51:30,700 --> 05:51:34,700
The thing is, many of the highest-rated and best-selling games from recent years

3653
05:51:34,700 --> 05:51:40,700
have still been the biggest budget and most visually impressive titles. Critics and consumers

3654
05:51:40,700 --> 05:51:46,460
are like, want and reward AAA game design, and amongst these games there will be some that

3655
05:51:46,460 --> 05:51:53,100
succeed, and some that fall short. It seems unrealistic to expect every game to meet the

3656
05:51:53,100 --> 05:51:58,620
highest standards, or to criticise the industry for caring too much about budgets and presentation,

3657
05:51:58,620 --> 05:52:01,980
while people continue to praise those same qualities in other games.

3658
05:52:03,740 --> 05:52:09,100
A lot of the problems mentioned here do have some relation to greed, and the gaming industry,

3659
05:52:09,100 --> 05:52:15,740
like other industries, can certainly be greedy. This also isn't anything new however.

3660
05:52:16,540 --> 05:52:21,180
After the success of Pong, gaming companies made so many Pong clones, the industry collapsed.

3661
05:52:21,900 --> 05:52:26,620
After the success of Atari, game developers made so many low-quality third-party games

3662
05:52:26,620 --> 05:52:32,140
that the industry collapsed again. Space Invaders led to too many arcade space games,

3663
05:52:32,140 --> 05:52:37,020
NES developers made too many action platformers, Doom led to too many Doom clones,

3664
05:52:37,020 --> 05:52:42,380
Grand Theft Auto led to too many GTA clones, Guitar Hero led to too many plastic peripherals,

3665
05:52:42,460 --> 05:52:47,660
The Wii led to too many motion control devices, and too many low-effort motion control games.

3666
05:52:47,660 --> 05:52:52,620
Call of Duty led to too many Call of Duties, Minecraft led to too many Minecraft clones,

3667
05:52:52,620 --> 05:52:57,980
Dark Souls led to too many Souls Likes, Skyrim and Far Cry 3 led to too many Open World games,

3668
05:52:57,980 --> 05:53:02,540
Daisy led to too many Early Access Survival games, PUBG and Fortnite led to too many Battle

3669
05:53:02,540 --> 05:53:07,500
Real games, Indie games led to too many Indie games, Slay the Spire led to too many Rogue-like

3670
05:53:07,500 --> 05:53:13,180
deckbuilders and most recently, Vampire Survivors led to too many whatever the hell genre this is.

3671
05:53:14,300 --> 05:53:20,540
The point is, success often leads to saturation, and it's been that way since the very start.

3672
05:53:21,500 --> 05:53:26,860
And yet, at the same time, the industry has often rewarded those who go against the grain.

3673
05:53:27,660 --> 05:53:34,380
Pac-Man, Tetris, Pokemon Red and Blue, Half-Life, The Sims, The DS, The Wii, Minecraft,

3674
05:53:34,460 --> 05:53:41,100
Dark Souls, Daisy, Battle Real, Gaming History is littered with games that did something different

3675
05:53:41,100 --> 05:53:46,940
and were rewarded for doing so. The point that I think everything comes down to in the end

3676
05:53:47,740 --> 05:53:53,500
is choice. People do have a choice in who they support and how they spend their time,

3677
05:53:54,140 --> 05:53:59,740
and sometimes the choices of gaming companies or the general public can be frustrating,

3678
05:54:00,540 --> 05:54:04,140
but it is their choice to make and they do have their reasons.

3679
05:54:05,500 --> 05:54:11,820
And after months of researching, thinking and writing about gaming history, I have come to the

3680
05:54:11,820 --> 05:54:20,700
conclusion that nothing defines this present moment in time as much as choice does. It is a

3681
05:54:20,700 --> 05:54:25,740
strange thing to try to write the history of the present, because so much of how we understand

3682
05:54:25,740 --> 05:54:31,900
the period is shaped by how it looks from the future. That said, I don't think there is a crisis

3683
05:54:31,900 --> 05:54:37,900
of modern gaming. I don't think the industry is in decline, and I don't think games are getting

3684
05:54:37,900 --> 05:54:44,780
worse. And the reason is because currently, right now, we all have an abundance of choice.

3685
05:54:45,980 --> 05:54:51,820
The industry has grown wider and become more accessible, but this is the result of growth,

3686
05:54:52,540 --> 05:54:55,900
and traditional gaming hasn't been sacrificed to achieve this.

3687
05:54:57,340 --> 05:55:00,940
Instead, within traditional gaming, we've seen a tremendous increase

3688
05:55:00,940 --> 05:55:05,980
in the number and types of indie games being made, while through emulation,

3689
05:55:05,980 --> 05:55:11,980
re-releases, community efforts, second-hand purchases, and official subscription services,

3690
05:55:11,980 --> 05:55:17,660
older games have never been more available, and with the likes of cloud gaming and indie games,

3691
05:55:17,660 --> 05:55:23,820
the barrier of entry into gaming has never been so low. The number of games being made

3692
05:55:23,820 --> 05:55:31,500
has also increased, and for most people, older games are still out there. Everyone today has

3693
05:55:31,500 --> 05:55:38,540
a great amount of choice, and that makes us rather lucky. I hope this abundance of choice

3694
05:55:38,540 --> 05:55:45,660
remains in the future. In fact, I hope we get even more choice in the years to come, but this isn't

3695
05:55:45,660 --> 05:55:53,900
guaranteed. One day, all old cartridges will stop working, CDs will rot, and old hardware

3696
05:55:53,900 --> 05:56:00,380
will fail. One day, computers may struggle to be compatible with older software. One day,

3697
05:56:00,380 --> 05:56:06,940
emulation might be shut down or strictly regulated. One day, fees may increase. One day,

3698
05:56:06,940 --> 05:56:12,220
competition may disappear. One day, the indie market may collapse. One day, the console market

3699
05:56:12,220 --> 05:56:18,940
may collapse. One day, the entire industry may collapse. It certainly has before. The future

3700
05:56:18,940 --> 05:56:26,140
holds no guarantees, and this is an industry of change. But right now, things aren't as bad as

3701
05:56:26,140 --> 05:56:32,620
many people might think they are. Good games are being made every single year, and goddamn,

3702
05:56:32,620 --> 05:56:39,100
is there a lot of good games already out there. Video games have come a long way,

3703
05:56:39,660 --> 05:56:47,420
and not every change has been for the better. But never before have people had so much choice.

3704
05:56:49,020 --> 05:56:49,980
Use it wisely.

3705
05:56:55,820 --> 05:57:08,940
This has been the entire history of video games. Thank you for watching.

3706
05:57:09,500 --> 05:57:19,580
I promised myself I'd do a Patreon plug here, so here it is. The video is over. I hope you enjoyed

3707
05:57:19,580 --> 05:57:26,940
it. It took a long time to make, but I think it was worth it. I've been making videos for five

3708
05:57:26,940 --> 05:57:32,620
years now. In fact, this will probably be up almost exactly on the channel's five-year anniversary.

3709
05:57:33,340 --> 05:57:39,020
And I am lucky to be in the position I'm in. But the channel growth has slowed a lot recently,

3710
05:57:39,500 --> 05:57:43,500
and I'm feeling under a lot of pressure to try to satisfy the algorithm.

3711
05:57:44,220 --> 05:57:49,980
And that's how YouTube goes. But I do feel very limited in what videos I can make.

3712
05:57:50,700 --> 05:57:55,740
I'd love to make more time-consuming and unique videos, like deep dives into certain areas of

3713
05:57:55,740 --> 05:58:01,740
the gaming industry. But it is a consistent worry for me how such videos will perform,

3714
05:58:01,740 --> 05:58:06,540
and whether I can afford to spend hundreds of hours on projects, knowing that a bad

3715
05:58:06,540 --> 05:58:10,860
Titan or thumbnail could doom the video for a bad click-through rate and so on.

3716
05:58:12,300 --> 05:58:17,260
For this reason, I'm thinking of trying to promote the Patreon more to try to get myself

3717
05:58:17,260 --> 05:58:23,100
a little more creative freedom. I've hardly mentioned the Patreon for the past year or so,

3718
05:58:23,100 --> 05:58:27,820
but I'm going to start promoting it a bit more often, like at the end of videos,

3719
05:58:27,820 --> 05:58:33,500
as I'm doing now. That's what this is. This is promotion. I don't have much to offer for

3720
05:58:33,500 --> 05:58:39,740
patrons, but I've revamped the tiers a bit. For $6 you get your name in the credits for videos,

3721
05:58:39,740 --> 05:58:45,180
but you can give less for that as well, and all patrons get all other benefits,

3722
05:58:45,180 --> 05:58:52,140
which include detailed monthly updates, the occasional Patreon poll, and access to some

3723
05:58:52,140 --> 05:58:57,820
unlisted videos which includes a few uncensored videos, a few older videos not on the channel

3724
05:58:57,820 --> 05:59:07,500
anymore, and a few unique reviews. Other than that, all I can say is I work many hours on these videos,

3725
05:59:07,500 --> 05:59:13,180
I work long hours, I rarely take breaks, I try my best to maintain a high level of quality,

3726
05:59:13,180 --> 05:59:19,740
and I do everything on my own. And you don't need to give anything, but it would mean a lot to me

3727
05:59:19,740 --> 05:59:29,740
if you did. Anyway, thank you for watching regardless, and I'll see you in the next video.
