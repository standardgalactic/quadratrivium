1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
I'm Jessica Flack and I'm the co-director of the Center for Complexity and Collective

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,800
Computation in the WID.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,840
And before I introduce tonight's topic and speakers, special guests, I would like to

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,160
first thank some of the folks in WID who made tonight happen.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,800
Maria Piat, Marianne Englisch, Jenny Eagleton, Sarah Shapiro, and Beth Misko, WID's outstanding

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,440
administrative and outreach team.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,600
I'd also like to thank Wisconsin Public Television, who's in the back filming the lectures

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,360
tonight, everybody at University Communications, who's done a great job with advertising, folks

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,280
at the ITHMIS for accommodating changes the last minute, and of course the IT team and

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,160
Alan Ruby in particular here in WID for their support tonight.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
And finally, the Center for Complexity and Collective Computation is indebted to John

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,160
Wiley and to the Templeton Foundation for very much appreciated financial support of

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,260
tonight's lecture series.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,900
Without this support, we could not have these kinds of events.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,620
So tonight's lecture on the roles of energy and information in 21st century biology is

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,620
part of a new public lecture series sponsored by C4, that's the Center for Complexity and

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,900
Collective Computation, and the series is called the John von Neumann Public Lectures

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,940
in Complexity and Computation.

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,380
And the lectures are going to be each month at about 7 p.m. the 2nd or 3rd Wednesday over

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,920
the course of the fall and spring semesters in 2012 and 2013.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,000
We have a great lineup this fall.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,280
The next speaker, the next lecture is on October 17th, and it's by Graham Spencer, who you

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,400
might know as one of the original founders of Excite, and he's currently a partner at

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,160
Google Ventures, and he's going to be talking about programming the Internet.

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,360
He's a super smart, broad-minded computer scientist who gives fun and insightful lectures,

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,960
so I hope to see you guys all there.

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,440
Intelligent information are two of the most fundamental concepts in science, affecting

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,600
phenomena over a vast range of scales, from quantum mechanics to the origin of life to

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,840
the evolution of cooperation in human and animal societies, to also, as you'll hear

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,760
about tonight, the size and pace of cities.

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,280
In tonight's lecture, Dr. Jeffrey West and Dr. David Krakauer, who I will introduce

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
momentarily, will explore how information and energy have shaped nature, and they'll

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,040
discuss the implications of the principles for the future of science, for future of biology,

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,880
and for society.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,720
Some of the questions that we will tackle over the course of the evening tonight include

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,920
what really are energy and information.

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,840
The laws of physics, and specifically the first law of thermodynamics, tells us that

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,080
energy cannot be created or destroyed.

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,800
As such, it's said to be a conserved quantity, meaning that the total energy in the universe

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,240
is a constant.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,240
It is this property of energy coupled to the fact that it can be hard to transform into

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,960
something useful that makes it seem like a finite expendable resource.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,280
Now is the same true for information?

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,920
Or can information be created and destroyed?

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,360
And if so, what does this mean?

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,800
So as you'll hear tonight, existing theories of information stress that information increases

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,560
our understanding of the world around us.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,640
In formal terms, we say that information reduces the uncertainty about the environment.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,760
But there's nothing in this definition that captures, I think, the fact that most of us,

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,560
for most of us in this audience, information is really about meaning.

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,280
It's the knowledge itself not about reducing uncertainty about the knowledge that we're

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,920
interested in.

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,960
So existing formal theories of information have nothing to say about this which you might

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
call semantics.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,320
Do we need a new theory of information?

56
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,960
That includes meaning or semantics.

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,720
That's one of the questions we'll ask tonight.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
Can we use existing formal theories of information?

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,760
Or are the new ones that we might build to overcome energetic constraints?

60
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,160
Or does information only help us find solutions to harness energy more efficiently?

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,360
These are deep and unanswered questions in physics and biology.

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,360
So finally, we are going to ask what would a new science of energy and information mean

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,720
for physics, for computer science, for biology, and for society?

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,760
So our first speaker is Dr. Jeffrey West.

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,720
Jeffrey is a theoretical physicist whose primary interests have been in fundamental questions

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,480
in physics, especially those concerning the elementary particles, their interactions

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,720
and cosmological implications.

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,520
Jeffrey received his BA from Cambridge in 1961, his doctorate from Stanford in 1966,

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,840
where he returned in 1970 as a member of the faculty.

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,560
He was the leader and founder of the high-energy physics group at Los Alamos National Labs.

71
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,800
Then he moved to the Santa Fe Institute in 2003, where he became a distinguished member

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,160
of the faculty and eventually became president of SFI for 2005 to 2009.

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,480
His long-term fascination has been in the origin of universal scaling laws that pervade

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,040
biology from the molecular genomic scale up through a minor country and sells to whole

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,360
organisms and ecosystems.

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,640
He's currently working to extend the theory of scaling that was developed in biology,

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,080
or as it was developed in biology, to social systems with the goal of understanding the

78
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,280
structure and dynamic of social organizations, such as cities and corporations.

79
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,600
Tonight, he will talk on energy scaling and the future of life on Earth for about 45

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
minutes.

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Our second lecture is David Krakauer.

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,280
David is the director of the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, co-director of the Center for

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,960
Complexity and Collective Computation, professor of genetics at UW-Madison and external professor

84
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,200
at the Santa Fe Institute.

85
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,800
A graduate of University London and Oxford University has authored more than a hundred

86
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,040
scientific papers, served on several journal editorial boards, and works to bridge the

87
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,920
gap between academia and business, and also between the physical and biological sciences

88
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,520
on the one hand and the social sciences and humanities on the other.

89
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,880
His research focuses on the evolutionary history of information processing mechanisms

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
in adaptive systems.

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,920
But his mind, and I know him well, is perhaps best described as sitting in an intellectual

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,960
space that has been deeply influenced by, I guess, I think a somewhat idiosyncratic

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,800
group of some of history's most interesting contributors, including John Louis Borges,

94
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,720
John von Neumann, Turing, Bill Hamilton, and Sir Thomas Brown.

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,240
Tonight he will talk for 30 minutes on the power of information to transform the 21st

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
century.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,040
Following the lectures of David and Jeffrey, Steve Paulson from Wisconsin Public Radio

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,080
will lead a panel discussion on the role of energy and information in 21st century biology.

99
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,000
Steve is the executive producer and interviewer with, to the best of our knowledge, a well

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,040
known science radio program.

101
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,080
Paulson is written for Salon, Slate, The Huffington Post, The Chronicle of Higher Education,

102
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,800
The Independent, and many other publications.

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,200
His radio reports have also been broadcast on NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered.

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,320
His recent book, Adams and Eden, Conversations on Religion and Science, was published back

105
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,520
for the University Press.

106
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,080
So please join me for a bit of a marathon session and welcome Steve, David, and Jeffrey.

107
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Thank you.

108
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,080
Thank you, David, thank you, Jessica, and thank you for inviting me to give this talk

109
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,040
and be part of this interesting discussion about energy and information.

110
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:54,880
So this is the title that was given to me, mostly because I was delinquent in giving

111
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,840
one myself.

112
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,480
And it does sort of cover what I'm going to talk about, but this is kind of the landscape

113
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:10,480
that I'm going to be talking about tonight in terms primarily of energy and the ideas

114
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,440
surrounding metabolism in biology, and it's a very idiosyncratic view, and as is clear

115
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,120
from the introduction, I come to it as a theoretical physicist wandering into areas of biology

116
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,480
and the social sciences.

117
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,160
And I'm going to begin it.

118
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm going to take as a point of departure something that's relevant to this, namely,

119
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,720
this is supported by the Center for Computation and Complexity, or whatever anyway.

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:49,200
Complexity was in it, and I wanted to use as a point of departure a statement by Stephen

121
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
Hawking, who is not someone that works on complexity and not someone that works on biology, but

122
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,640
is a highly reductionistic physicist, and here's something he said about 10 years ago.

123
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,960
Some say that while the 20th century was the century of physics, we are now entering the

124
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,360
century of biology.

125
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,840
What do you think of this?

126
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,160
And many people believe the 21st century is the century of biology, and it certainly will

127
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,440
be, but more importantly, and this I do believe is what Hawking says, I think the next century

128
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,560
will be the century of complexity, because many of the problems we're going to face

129
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,880
and are facing are to do with complex adaptive systems, and I'll be talking a little bit

130
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,040
about them.

131
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,680
And I want to use this, as I say, as a point of departure because implicit in this is an

132
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,160
idea of what complexity is, and that's something I'm not going to discuss, but accept to use

133
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,920
it to talk about what is not complex first, because it brings in the whole role of energy.

134
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,360
And this is a system we're familiar with, the solar system, and this is a system that

135
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,040
is often thought of as not complex.

136
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:03,160
It is simple, and by simple it means that the whole dynamics of that system, the motion

137
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,400
of the planets around the sun and therefore of the satellites that power our communication

138
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,120
systems, are all encoded in two very simple looking equations.

139
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,560
This is a highly non-technical talk, you don't have to understand the equations, everybody

140
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,480
is familiar with the idea F equals MA, but they're in the two laws proposed by Newton

141
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,880
that kind of covers everything to do with the motion of the solar system, the planets

142
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,680
around the sun, but much, much else, and much of modern physics is based on these equations

143
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,200
or versions of these equations, but critical in this is the flow of energy, the idea that

144
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,960
energy is the kind of fundamental thing that's underlying this motion, and one of the crucial

145
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,440
aspects of that is already been mentioned by Jessica, the conservation of energy.

146
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,920
But if you add to it another set of equations, which you don't have to understand, but important

147
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,440
to understand conceptually the equations of Maxwell for unifying electricity and magnetism

148
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,960
and giving rise to understanding radiation, electromagnetic radiation, that pretty much

149
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,080
encompasses much of the kind of world that we live in, and indeed, just to take these

150
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,360
two equations with these equations is how your cell phone works and allows everybody

151
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,680
to communicate and everything else that's pretty much around us, and these, the word

152
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,360
simple applies to because they invoke the idea that you can encode everything in this symbolic

153
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,480
fashion and from that everything else follows, even down to the quantum level, and one of

154
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,640
the things I want to emphasize is that again, these are to do with the flow of energy and

155
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,160
because they are simple and they are written in a mathematically precise form, you can

156
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,080
calculate things somehow in principle to any degree of accuracy, and one of the great

157
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,960
triumphs of 20th century science is this calculation, which is calculating the strength

158
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,560
of the magnet associated with the electron, and here's the theory to 12 decimal places,

159
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,920
and here's the experiment agreeing with it to 12 decimal places.

160
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,760
This is kind of extraordinary, and this is quite unusual actually in the world that we

161
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,480
live in, because the world that we live in, oh, I forgot about that, I put this slide

162
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,040
in, just to show you some of the main characters that you're familiar with that have, that

163
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,080
I think have played an important role in developing ideas of energy.

164
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,120
One is this, is Newton, that's the kind of rock star image of Newton.

165
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,440
This is Einstein looking like Einstein, and this is Max Planck, the origin of photons

166
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:50,520
and the quantum, and this is someone, oops, this is someone that most people are not familiar

167
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:57,520
with, it's another, there was a famous Bill Hamilton here, biologist, very famous ecologist,

168
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,640
biologist, the David or Jessica actually mentioned.

169
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:09,520
This is a really deep Bill Hamilton, this is Bill Hamilton, he was an Irishman who I

170
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,560
sadly drank himself to death, but he encoded something extremely important about energy,

171
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,200
and the physicists in the audience will forgive me, but basically he said that all physical

172
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,560
systems in some sense minimize the amount of energy that needs to be expended.

173
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,000
So this kind of a least, minimum least energy principle, Hamilton's principle, it's actually

174
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,440
called technically the principle of least action, but roughly speaking this is the framework

175
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:45,440
in which all of the physics that encompasses everything from the macroscopic down to string

176
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,400
theory operates from, is using those principles, and it's to do based on energy.

177
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,200
So here's a picture of energy, this is energy, we're familiar with it, and this is highly

178
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,600
complex use of energy because these are highly non-linear effects and you're familiar with

179
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:09,640
them, you're also familiar with this, this is the energy that we create on the planet

180
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,080
through objects like this, cities, and I'm going to talk a little bit about that shortly,

181
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:23,280
and these are driven of course by us, which involve energy, so there are these multiple

182
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:33,160
levels of energy, and they go all the way down to the thing that drives these us, that

183
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:40,720
drives us to create the light and the energy by which we live, our brains and our cells,

184
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,360
and these of course also operate by energy themselves, but they invoke something new

185
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,360
that is typically not been considered in physics, and they invoke information, the idea that

186
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,960
information necessarily is needed to be put into the system in order to understand the

187
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,840
way these systems have evolved and the way they organize and the way they behave, and

188
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,520
these systems are typically outside physics, and they form much of the work of biology

189
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:19,440
and the social sciences, and they are complex, but more importantly they evolve and are therefore

190
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,800
adaptive, so these are very different in their nature from the kind of simplistic system that

191
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,640
we see in the motions of the planets, or even may I say in thinking about string theory

192
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,600
as the origins of the universe, because we can write definitive, precise equations in

193
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,280
principle for those, whereas for these we have this extraordinary challenging problem

194
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,120
of both integrating information in it and understanding the role of energy, and what

195
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm going to explore tonight is how far one can take the traditional physics thinking

196
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:04,480
without invoking explicitly information to understand some of the organization and dynamics

197
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,560
of these systems, and then David will talk about information and maybe in the discussion

198
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,880
we'll talk a little bit about the integration. So here's another kind of system that you're

199
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,360
familiar with, a forest, and all of these systems obey second law of thermodynamics and

200
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,680
the conservation of energy, and therefore the production of entropy, which is the kind

201
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,120
of random stuff, the dissipative kind of energy that comes from doing work and creating order,

202
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,560
it is the resulting disorder that comes from ordering the system, and one of the challenges

203
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,760
and I would say, I would even go as far as to say, I think the major challenge conceptually

204
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,280
in 21st century science is understanding this integration between energy and resources on

205
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,680
the one hand, metabolism in biology with information, genomics maybe, and integrate and get a complete

206
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,440
understanding of these. These are typically considered separately, roughly speaking, in

207
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:13,360
the kind of academic way in which we think about these things. So what I'm going to talk

208
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,600
about in these systems is, as a physicist, I want a quantitative, predictive, mathematical

209
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,920
in principle understanding of the dynamics and organization of these systems, and it

210
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,000
is clear for the kinds of systems I just referred to, we cannot do what we did for understanding

211
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,080
the magnetic moment of the electron. We're not going to get equations that produce precise

212
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:46,080
calculations, but maybe what we can get is what we call coarse grain descriptions. So

213
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,720
for example, the kinds of questions that we ought to be able to answer quantitatively

214
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,480
are questions like this. Why is it that I can look across this room and say, everybody

215
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:05,160
will be dead in 100 years? In fact, if I look more closely, I would say that, including

216
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:12,160
myself, may I say, but where does 100 years come from for a typical lifespan of a human

217
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,440
being? Why isn't it 10 years or 1,000 years? And how is that connected to underlying molecular

218
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,920
structures of the genome and the respiratory complex? Where in the hell does that come

219
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,800
from? And why is it that the same stuff, if it were a mouse, only lives two or three

220
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:35,160
years? So those are the kinds of coarse-grained questions that one ought to be able to answer

221
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:42,240
in a predictive framework, and I'm not going to talk much about these, but in what role

222
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,080
does energy and metabolism play in these? So here's another set of similar kinds of

223
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,720
coarse-grained questions. Why do we need eight hours of sleep? Why do we need to sleep? Why

224
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,040
are not two hours or 18 hours like a mouse or four hours like an elephant? Where in the

225
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:04,280
hell do these numbers come from? And why is it that mice get many more tumors during their

226
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:10,200
lifespan per unit volume than human beings? And therefore, why in the hell are we doing

227
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,360
all these experiments on mice and trying to draw conclusions about human beings? We need

228
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,960
to understand those kinds of questions. And the one I really love is why is it very good

229
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,240
to grow babies in your body but not grow cancer, which is also part of you? So these are kind

230
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,640
of coarse-grained questions. And one that has occupied me in the last few years is are citizen

231
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:39,640
companies just large organisms that are biological? Are citizen organisms just, is New York a great

232
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:46,960
big whale? And Google a great big elephant? And if that's true, how come that organisms

233
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:56,040
die? Companies die but cities don't. And in fact, I would say, roughly speaking, almost

234
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,520
no cities die, although you can think of counter examples. We have done awful experiments to

235
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,520
test that. We've dropped two atom bombs on two cities and 30 years later they're functioning.

236
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,120
Companies, all companies die. And so one of the questions is in a coarse-grained way, can

237
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,160
we predict when Google and Microsoft are going to go bust? Because they surely will eventually.

238
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,480
Okay, so those are the kinds of questions. And I want to lead into all of this. This is

239
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,480
biology, but I want to lead into it via cities because we are facing an extraordinary challenge

240
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,320
and this is addressing the question of how biological are cities and can we understand

241
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,920
them that way? We are facing this extraordinary challenge that we live in this exponentially

242
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,480
expanding universe of socioeconomic quantities. And just to give you an example, we've gone

243
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,640
from a few percent being urban to over 80 percent being urban in just 200 years. The

244
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,960
world's across the halfway mark. We're going to go to somewhere close to 80 percent by

245
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,800
2050. China's building several hundred new cities in the next 20 to 30 years. And indeed,

246
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,800
this statistic ought to freak everybody out that every week from now to 2050 on the average

247
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,240
one and a half million people are being urbanized. Therefore, every two months, there's a New

248
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,240
York metropolitan area coming onto this planet. So by the beginning of December, there's another

249
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,440
New York metropolitan area. By the beginning of February, there's another one. By the beginning

250
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,440
of April, there's another one and so on inextricably for the next 30, 40 years. Now, can I use

251
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,240
explosives in this talk?

252
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Sure.

253
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,760
Okay. How in the f*** are we going to deal with that? This is an extraordinary challenge.

254
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,760
So I want to get into that and it is related to energy. Okay. So the other aspect to recognize

255
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,360
is that all of the tsunami of problems we're facing from global warming to the environment

256
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,360
to health problems to crime to resource problems, water, energy and so on, all are driven by

257
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,360
urbanization by people in cities. So that's the problem. But cities are also the solution

258
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,360
because they suck all of you lot into Madison. Cities suck in people and they are the sources

259
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:25,360
of ideas, innovation and wealth creation. So this is what cities are represented by,

260
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,360
the good of cities. This is what in fact attracts people to cities, all these good things, culture,

261
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,360
music, goods and so on, driven and participating in an ever expanding, exponential, expanding

262
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:48,080
economy. But if this is a thermodynamic system, which it is, it produces entropy. So it produces

263
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:56,800
socioeconomic entropy. Incidentally, side comment, if you look in any of the standard

264
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:04,800
economics books, you never see the word entropy. But what is more amazing is, we've looked

265
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,080
in five of the standard texts, only in one did the word energy appear. That's a side

266
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,600
comment, provocative comment. So here's socioeconomic entropy. Okay. You're familiar with all this.

267
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,600
And the question is, is that what New York and San Francisco and it looked like in 2050

268
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:33,600
or that, or like this, or this? This is what we want, or even like that, beautiful, or

269
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,760
like that in a hundred years or that. And most importantly, to maintain that, which

270
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,520
is the social buzz of a city, the interaction of people. So here's the question, given this

271
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:55,560
extraordinary role of cities, we need a science of cities. Okay. And I'm going to use energy

272
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,720
as the as a major piece of that. So the question is, can we have a science of that? And is

273
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,760
that another version of this? Well, if it is, that would be good, actually. If this were

274
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,760
another version of that, because you ask any question that has a quantitative metric associated

275
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,680
with it, like, how many trees are there of a given size? How many leaves are there in

276
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,000
a given branch of a given size? How much energy is flowing through each one? How many, how

277
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
big is the canopy? What is the mortality rate? What is the growth rate? How, how far apart

278
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,880
the trees have given size, etc. All those can be answered in a quantitative conceptual

279
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,800
framework with a bunch of mathematical formulae, which in a coarse grained way, agrees with

280
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,000
data from forests all across the globe. And the question is, can we do the same for this?

281
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sorry, we'll submit to go backwards. So we're here, some of the commonalities, metaphorically,

282
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,520
at least, between social organizations and biological organisms, which we're all familiar

283
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,520
with. And I'm going to show you some just very briefly some data that substantiates

284
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:16,720
the idea that we understand a little bit about, generically, the way forests work. So what

285
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,080
this is, is just a plot of the number of trees of a given size. The theory, which I'm going

286
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,320
to talk about momentarily, the theory predicts that it goes as the inverse square of the

287
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,920
diameter of the tree trunks. The number of trees of a given size goes as the inverse

288
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,640
square of the diameter of the tree trunks, which means if you look at trees that are

289
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,200
twice the size of any others, there's a quarter of the number, two squared, a quarter of the

290
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,000
number, if it were three times, it'd be eighth and so on. So you get the idea. And there's

291
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,680
data. And what is important about it, not only does the data fit the theory, but you

292
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:56,680
can see it's over a period of 30, 40 years, this forest, which is a tropical forest, has

293
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:03,680
changed dramatically. Lots of trees have died, new ones have grown, rapid turnover. But this

294
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:10,680
law has remained robust. And there's data into the 90s and 2000s that continue with

295
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,480
that. I'm going to miss this. So here's the kind of framework that I want to invoke. Here's

296
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,280
a cartoon of, say, an ecosystem. I could have done a city. And this is the lens that I want

297
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,840
to look at it through. And all of these equations actually are really to do with energy flow.

298
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,960
So another concept I want to talk about very briefly is the concept of scalability that

299
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:42,960
a system needs to be scalable if it is a system that is going to be resilient and evolvable

300
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,160
and adaptive to change. It needs to be scalable just in the sense that we are scalable. This

301
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:57,160
is us. We have scaled over a range of 100 million in size in mass. We go down to something

302
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,760
that sits on the palm of my hand all the way up to something that's bigger than this, much

303
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:11,280
bigger than this room. And we're all pretty much the same thing. We may look different,

304
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:18,280
but in terms of, in a coarse-grained average way in terms of our life history and our physiology,

305
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,320
we're all pretty much the same thing. And I'm going to show you that in a moment. But

306
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,160
even going further, in going from the molecular levels, I could have put the genome here.

307
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,720
This is what the cartoon of the molecules that produce your energy all the way through

308
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,320
mitochondria to cells, to multicellular organisms like this, to produce things like this, houses

309
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,280
and produce things like this, so that, in fact, what goes on here scales all the way

310
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,280
through this to keep this going. All of these have to be scalable because they are highly

311
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,520
complex and high and continuously evolving and continuously adapting. And so there has

312
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,520
to be a kind of scalability. And out of that comes the idea that you can't have this being

313
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:13,520
arbitrary. There have to be emergent laws that govern this. And I think the next slide,

314
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,280
ah, yes. So in a similar way to the way we scaled in a much shorter time frame in terms

315
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,520
of our growth, and one of the things that I will talk about briefly in a moment is about

316
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,100
growth and the fact that the same theory, the same theoretical framework, which I will

317
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:40,040
come to in a moment, which ah, it purports to explain the organization dynamics growth

318
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:47,320
of forests that I talked about earlier applied to us, mammals, gives rise to equations like

319
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,320
this or pictures like this for what is called a growth curve.

320
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
This is the weight as a function of age.

321
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,000
This is us.

322
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,440
It happens to be a rat version of us.

323
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,440
And the line there, the solid line,

324
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,880
is a prediction from the theory.

325
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,680
And the points are the data.

326
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,760
And you can see it's very good.

327
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,800
And this can be done for any organism.

328
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,680
And if I had time, I would show you

329
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,480
lots of other wonderful fits.

330
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,800
But the point is that we can understand growth.

331
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,440
And I will come to that in a moment.

332
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,920
But the important thing I want to stress now,

333
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,600
moving to social systems, is that this

334
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,960
were taken over to socioeconomic systems,

335
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,520
namely that the organism grows quickly and then stops,

336
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,240
like we did.

337
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,840
I mean, one of the amazing things about biology

338
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,680
is that we eat, we grow, and then we go on eating,

339
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
but we don't grow.

340
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,160
And the theory explains that.

341
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,640
And I don't have time to go into it.

342
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,120
Maybe we can discuss it later.

343
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,040
And it's all to do with the input of energy

344
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,800
and the distribution of energy and the scaling

345
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,120
of the networks that are inside us.

346
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,320
But the point is this would be very bad

347
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,000
if it were a socioeconomic system,

348
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,240
because this is our image of socioeconomic systems.

349
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,720
And I showed you a picture before of the economy,

350
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,080
always open and expanding.

351
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,400
And I want to come back to this in a moment.

352
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,920
So here's a picture of the extraordinary scaling

353
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,360
in biology.

354
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
So let me spend a minute on it.

355
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,160
What you see is plotted here is the most fundamental quantity,

356
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,360
certainly from a physicist's view, of in biology.

357
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,920
That is your metabolic rate.

358
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,600
How much energy do you need per day to stay alive?

359
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,400
The 2,000 food calories a day that you eat to stay alive.

360
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,960
And here it is plotted on the vertical axis

361
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,840
against the weight, the mass of the organism,

362
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,320
on the horizontal axis.

363
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,080
And it's plotted in a Byzantine way.

364
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,920
So I can put mice and elephants on the same graph.

365
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,280
And the Byzantine way is that instead of being linear,

366
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,280
it goes up by factors of 10, 1, 10, 100, 1,000 watts,

367
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,960
1, 10, 100, 1,000 kilograms.

368
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,640
So we can get everywhere on the same graph.

369
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,240
And what you see is something extraordinary,

370
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,360
that there's an extraordinary regularity

371
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,200
when we're dealing with maybe one of the most complex

372
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,120
and diverse phenomena in the universe.

373
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,320
Something unbelievably simple, ridiculously simple

374
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,280
has emerged.

375
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,920
And this is at some level astonishing

376
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,440
because we believe that each one of these organisms,

377
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,200
each subsystem of that organism, each organ, each cell

378
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
type, each genome has evolved with its own unique history

379
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,280
and its own unique environmental niche.

380
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,320
So you might have expected from that natural selection

381
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,560
viewpoint that if I plotted anything

382
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,160
versus the size of an organism, it'd

383
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,280
be all over the map representing, manifesting

384
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,440
the historical contingency involved in all of this.

385
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
No, that's not what you see.

386
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,080
You see something ridiculously, ridiculously regular.

387
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,480
And that regularity has some extraordinary features.

388
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,360
For one, the slope of it is approximately 3 quarters.

389
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,400
And that 3 quarters is less than one.

390
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,120
One would be a slope, a line like this.

391
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,800
And one is what you might naively

392
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,880
expect if you thought everything were pretty much the same.

393
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,520
The most naive level, you double the size of an organism,

394
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,560
double the number of cells.

395
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,440
Therefore, double the amount of energy needed

396
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,800
to keep it alive.

397
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
That's not what you see.

398
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,800
You see something less than one, which

399
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,000
means in that language, double the size of an organism.

400
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Approximately instead of needing twice the amount of energy,

401
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,840
you only need roughly 75%.

402
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,440
So there's this extraordinary economy of scale

403
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,120
as you get bigger, and this is called sublinear behavior.

404
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,400
So it turns out that if you look at any physiological variable

405
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,280
that you can measure and or any life history event

406
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,520
that you can think of, it all has this kind of character.

407
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,240
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.

408
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,240
There's heart rate, very mundane kind of quantity,

409
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
versus body size.

410
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,760
I'm not going to explain it in detail,

411
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,680
but what you see is, again, a very simple scaling law.

412
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,560
This is you thinking.

413
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,640
This is your white matter to gray matter in your brain.

414
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,480
Again, a very simple law evolving.

415
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,160
This is your genomes.

416
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,400
And what you see from this is that you

417
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,200
have this regular behavior, and the other remarkable thing

418
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,120
is all the slopes of those, like that three quarters,

419
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,840
are simple multiples of one quarter.

420
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,800
Four plays this amazing role in these scaling laws

421
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,000
of extraordinary complex phenomena.

422
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,160
What is underlying them?

423
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,720
And this is work I did with colleagues at the Santa Fe

424
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,160
Institute, and I'll tell you who they are in a moment.

425
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
The idea is, how in the hell can this

426
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:58,200
be that all of these phenomena have simple scaling laws?

427
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,480
And why is it that the scaling laws of mammals

428
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,920
are the same as birds, fish, crustacea, insects, and so on?

429
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,880
How can that be?

430
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,280
Well, what could be universal among them?

431
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,520
What could be universal is somehow

432
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,240
the supply of energy and resources through networks

433
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,280
has to be a commonality among them.

434
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,880
And the idea here was that it is the mathematics,

435
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,560
the universal mathematics, and geometric topological properties

436
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,320
of those networks that transcend design,

437
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,840
that are constraining natural selection.

438
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,120
That's the idea.

439
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,040
And I'm not going to, I don't have time to go into that,

440
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,560
other than to say that if you look at these networks,

441
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,960
that's your brain, that's your white-to-gray matter

442
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,640
of the brain, that's your lungs, that's a tree,

443
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,000
that's a little thing, lives inside an elephant,

444
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
but they're ubiquitous.

445
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,520
And they have these repositories.

446
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,760
They have these properties.

447
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,400
And if you use those properties, put them

448
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,520
into some fancy mathematics, and use Bill Hamilton's

449
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,960
principle of energy least action kind of ideas,

450
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,960
out-pop all of these marvelous scaling laws,

451
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,240
including the number four, the one quarter, which

452
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,040
happens to be, for the information, the dimension

453
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,080
that we live in, three plus one.

454
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
And just to add to that, the plus one

455
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,160
is to do with the fact that these networks have

456
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,520
a fractal-like behavior.

457
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,200
That's a kind of tangential remark.

458
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
So here's others.

459
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,800
This is down at the intracellular level.

460
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,400
This is the intermiticondrial level, and so on.

461
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,920
So here's that growth again.

462
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
So the idea is we have this theory.

463
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,360
The claim is we have this wonderful theory

464
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,200
that, based on networks, the mathematics of networks,

465
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,720
and that from that, we can understand these scaling laws.

466
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,080
But also, if you like, we understand the network.

467
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,640
We can understand the structure of the network

468
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,240
within each of the organisms.

469
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,360
And you can use that to go back to this growth

470
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,560
and use this kind of idea that, if you eat, you metabolize,

471
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,040
that energy goes through the network, controls the network,

472
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,760
which maintains the cells that are there,

473
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,720
replaces ones that are dead, and grows new ones.

474
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,240
And then from that, you can mathematics it,

475
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,840
and that gives rise to this equation, which

476
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,040
actually invokes all of the properties of the network

477
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,560
and gives rise to these kinds of what we call sigmoidal,

478
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,560
meaning they stop growing curves.

479
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,200
So here's kind of the summary of this part.

480
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,920
We have these amazing nonlinear quarter power scaling laws.

481
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,360
They represent an economy of scale.

482
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,200
The one quarter is intimately related

483
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,600
to flows of energy in networks.

484
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,360
One thing I did not emphasize is the pace of life

485
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,720
systematically slows with size, so that, for example, heart

486
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,920
rates decrease systematically according

487
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,440
to these quarter power scaling laws.

488
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,600
The rate of diffusion of oxygen, say, across membranes,

489
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,440
decreases with size.

490
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,800
Organisms live longer systematically,

491
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,760
and so on and so forth.

492
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,960
Everything to do with time slows down the bigger you are.

493
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,600
Growth is sigmoidal, reaches a stable size of maturity.

494
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,680
And to emphasize again, the idea is

495
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,040
this is all based on the mathematics and properties

496
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
of networks.

497
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,280
So, and this is a sustainable system.

498
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,680
It's sustainable phenomenologically,

499
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,440
because it's been around a couple of billion years or more.

500
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,560
Part of that sustainability, I believe,

501
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,040
is actually invoked in the fact that things stop growing.

502
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,840
They stabilize, and most organisms, not all,

503
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,200
and we can discuss this.

504
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Most organisms spend most of their mature life

505
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,760
in a stable size configuration.

506
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
Not all, and there are exceptions,

507
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,080
and we can discuss that.

508
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,080
But this leads to a sustainable, resilient system.

509
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,480
And the question is, oh, I'm sorry, yes.

510
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
So this is the Motley crew that I work with,

511
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,320
some are biologists, some physicists, some chemists.

512
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,000
But I then took the work over into social organizations,

513
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,320
and there's another Motley crew, that the top guys did

514
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,760
all the work.

515
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
All the guys at the bottom are famous

516
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,440
and did none of the work.

517
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,880
And the guys in the middle started off with me

518
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,960
and then moved on to other things.

519
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,680
OK, so here's the question, the first question,

520
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,880
about whether cities and companies are biological.

521
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,680
The first thing is, do they scale?

522
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:38,680
So what we said before was that whales live in the ocean,

523
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,000
and elephants have trunks, and giraffes long necks,

524
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,640
and we stand on two feet, and mice scurry around.

525
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,000
But in fact, at the kind of 85% level,

526
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,120
then scaled versions of one another

527
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,760
in this nonlinear, quarter-power fashion,

528
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
this mathematical fashion.

529
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,960
They're scaled versions of one another.

530
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,680
Is that true of cities?

531
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
And is it a kind of universal scaling,

532
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,760
as it is in biology?

533
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,960
So are cities scaled versions of one another?

534
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,160
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,

535
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,960
which is a scaled up Madison, which is a scaled up Santa Fe?

536
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,760
Even though they look completely different?

537
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,160
Well, you can only answer that.

538
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,000
I mean, first sight, it's hard to believe.

539
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,160
Every city feels so unique.

540
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,240
But of course, you can only answer that by looking at data.

541
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,400
But one of the reasons you might think

542
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,520
there are scaling phenomena, there

543
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,720
are these kind of generic universal similarities,

544
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,880
is because cities are indeed networks.

545
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,400
I mean, there's the obvious networks

546
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,040
of roads and electrical lines and all the rest of it,

547
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,080
like this, transportation systems.

548
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,840
But more importantly, there's this network, which never

549
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,720
occurs, essentially, in biology.

550
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,880
It is the network of us talking to one another.

551
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,040
It's us, social networks, that is unique.

552
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,120
It's only been around on this planet for maybe 10,000 years.

553
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,840
Maybe in the universe, for all we know, for 10,000 years.

554
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,440
But certainly, in our solar system, this is it.

555
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,600
It's new.

556
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,360
And it's this.

557
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,240
This is just people talking to one another,

558
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,840
how they interact with one another.

559
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,120
So whoops, I seem to have lost the slide.

560
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,000
It doesn't matter.

561
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,880
So I use this slide.

562
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,360
What is the city but the people?

563
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,160
Indeed, the city is not the buildings and the roads

564
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,200
and all these other stuff.

565
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,000
It's us.

566
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,680
We are the city.

567
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,520
And that stuff is a manifestation

568
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,320
of the interactions between us.

569
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,600
And that's something that is outside of biology

570
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,840
but is integral to biology because it's driven by biology

571
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,200
and it's driven in large part by energy.

572
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,320
And I'm going to talk about that.

573
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,840
So the other part of the network is not just

574
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,240
that we interact with each other but we cluster.

575
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,760
So I'm going to not say much more about that

576
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,720
but go straight to the data and ask the question about scaling.

577
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,520
So this is a graph plotted in the same way

578
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,400
as those biological graphs were.

579
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,560
But this is a mundane one, the number of petrol stations.

580
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,680
I was working with European colleagues,

581
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,720
number of gas stations in a city as a function of its size

582
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,120
in various countries.

583
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,000
And you can see there's pretty good evidence of scaling.

584
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,880
It's again, there's a very simple line on this plot

585
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,840
plotted this way, very much like biology.

586
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,160
And like biology, this would be linear

587
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,760
so that you don't, when you double the size of a city,

588
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,920
you don't need twice as many gas stations.

589
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,640
In fact, what you find from this,

590
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,720
you only need about 85% more gas stations.

591
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,160
The slope of this line is not three quarters

592
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,160
as it is in biology, it's about 0.85, it turns out.

593
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,840
Most importantly though is that they're pretty much the same.

594
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,600
The slopes of these are the same.

595
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,520
The same economy of scale occurs

596
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,320
in all these European countries

597
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,200
but it occurs in Colombia.

598
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,520
It occurs in Chile, it occurs in China.

599
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,000
Anywhere you look, across the globe,

600
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,520
you get the same scaling and if you look

601
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,480
at any infrastructural quantity that you can measure,

602
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,640
you get the same scaling as this.

603
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,640
There's a consistent, always roughly 15% saving

604
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,880
every time you double, okay?

605
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,320
Okay, 10.

606
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,160
Good, perfect.

607
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,320
So this is kind of a mundane quantity

608
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,520
but here's, and that's like biology.

609
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,800
Looks just like biology except it's 0.85

610
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,440
but this is something that doesn't exist in biology.

611
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,760
Wages, you lot, super creative people

612
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,800
and you ask how do those scale

613
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,240
with the size of the city and here they are.

614
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,160
This is wages at the top and this is super creative,

615
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,160
so-called super creative by a man named Richard Florida

616
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,360
and what you see is there's more fluctuations in the data

617
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,360
but there's pretty good evidence of scaling

618
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,880
but most importantly, the scaling is different

619
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,120
than in biology.

620
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,240
The slope of these are bigger than one

621
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,800
rather than less than one and this is critical.

622
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,640
Namely, the slope of these you see is roughly about 1.15

623
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,640
so that what that says is that if you double the size

624
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,200
instead of needing less per capita,

625
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,760
you have more per capita

626
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,800
and I will come back to this in a moment.

627
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,720
So here's wages, super creative,

628
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,600
here's patents, this is some prude measure

629
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,520
of the innovation of a city.

630
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,000
The slope of this is also about 1.15,

631
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,360
this is the crime in Japan, so a little bit bigger, 1.15,

632
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,000
this is police, tax receipts, construction,

633
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,640
all about 1.15 and there they are all plotted

634
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,600
on one another, just a few of them

635
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,600
to show a universality of income, GDP, crime and patents,

636
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,320
very different things but they all scale in the same way,

637
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,280
there's quite a lot of fluctuations

638
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,000
and the slope of that is roughly 1.15

639
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and what is, we believe that underlying this

640
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,120
the universality of social networks

641
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,760
of the way we interact with each other

642
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,640
is a kind of universal phenomenon

643
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,600
whether you're in China, Japan, Columbia,

644
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,320
the United States, anywhere,

645
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,880
the fundamentals of the social interaction is universal

646
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,600
and that is what is being manifested

647
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,800
in these scaling laws, these scaling laws

648
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,760
are for multiple socioeconomic quantities

649
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,120
anywhere in the world, we've looked at data

650
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,640
in Europe, the United States, China, Japan,

651
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,320
Latin America and so forth.

652
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,240
What is interesting to substantiate that

653
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,960
is this graph which is very recent data

654
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,240
which is the number of cell phone people,

655
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,320
none of the people you call on your phone

656
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,440
on the average as a function of city size.

657
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,320
So this is a kind of way of tapping in

658
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,800
to the network, the social network

659
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,880
and if this theoretical framework

660
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,440
of the mathematics of that social network

661
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,680
is the right one, the slope of this should be

662
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,600
about the same as these other networks

663
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,040
and indeed we could have plotted this on top of this

664
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,880
and it would have fit right on top of it.

665
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,680
So this is the number of people you talk to

666
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,320
on the average as a function of your city size, okay.

667
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,720
So I'm gonna miss this

668
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,360
and that's what I said a moment ago

669
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,200
and here's kind of the summary of this,

670
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,080
the good, the bad and the ugly.

671
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,040
If you double the size of a city

672
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,160
or if you look at a city that's twice as big

673
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,520
as another city, then systematically across the globe

674
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,880
and you double the size, you can go from 50,000

675
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,320
to 100,000 or 5,000,000 to 10,000,000

676
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,600
doesn't matter where you begin, just double the size,

677
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,000
systematically income, wealth, patents, colleges,

678
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,800
creative people, police, crime, AIDS, flu,

679
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,080
all of these things, the good, bad and the ugly

680
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,880
all go up together to the same degree

681
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,040
and at the same time, you save about 15%

682
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,920
on the infrastructure.

683
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,800
Big cities are good and the bigger ones are better still

684
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,440
both at the collective level,

685
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,520
they save on infrastructure per capita,

686
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,320
I had a graph which I flipped through,

687
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,200
they save on carbon footprint per capita

688
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,040
and at the individual level,

689
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,200
everybody is attracted to cities

690
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,200
by the first lot of those income, wealth,

691
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,400
number of patents, colleges and the general buzz of city

692
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,960
and ignore the other bad things,

693
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,760
the fact that they're coming along with it,

694
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,760
handing glove as more crime, disease and so forth, okay.

695
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,480
So, the network dynamics is the one

696
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,720
that dominates this again

697
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,360
and the network dynamics has the following

698
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,360
interesting phenomenon that if it's sublinear scaling,

699
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,920
then we have this pace of life slowing with size

700
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,160
that I mentioned, but if it's super linear,

701
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,320
bigger than one that we see in socioeconomic systems

702
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:18,100
in cities and are driven by the social networks,

703
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,540
then the theory tells you the pace of life

704
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,300
systematically increases with size

705
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,540
and so the pace of life in New York

706
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,700
is systematically faster than it is in Madison,

707
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,140
which is systematically faster than it is in Espanola,

708
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,660
which is a tiny town here, Santa Fe, in a systematic way

709
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,020
and here's some whimsical data to show you that,

710
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,060
we've looked at many things,

711
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,300
on the left is some data on heart rate versus body size,

712
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,820
the one on the right is walking speed,

713
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,900
show you walking speed,

714
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,900
there's people have actually measured walking speed,

715
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,900
perfect and you can see it's systematically rising

716
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,380
and it's in reasonably good agreement with the data,

717
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,540
but that, you know, why, because walking actually,

718
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,900
walking in a city is a social phenomenon, okay.

719
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,820
So, I'm gonna miss this out, I think.

720
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,140
So, this is kind of a summary

721
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,340
and I'm gonna finish off in the last few minutes

722
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,340
with the last part of this.

723
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,260
So, unlike biology, super linear scaling,

724
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,980
socioeconomic, which is to do with wealth creation

725
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,620
and innovation and ideas, dominates,

726
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,860
and so you get this kind of 15% rule,

727
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:34,140
which I'm not gonna talk about its origins here,

728
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,620
that also leads to a systematic increase

729
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,540
in the pace of life and the last thing

730
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,100
I'm gonna talk about, which is very satisfactory,

731
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,740
is that if this is true, which it is,

732
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,640
and it comes from these networks,

733
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,020
then I'm gonna talk about growth

734
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,660
and the idea of open-ended growth following from this

735
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,380
because we're gonna use the same kind of growth equation

736
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,260
that, again, based on energy equivalent

737
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,340
of the flow of energy through these systems

738
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,080
leading to maintenance and growth,

739
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,100
and that's what we had before for us,

740
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,060
the sublinear scaling leading to bounded growth

741
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,240
and if it's super linear scaling,

742
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,820
there's a cartoon on the left,

743
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,820
this leads to actually faster than exponential growth.

744
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,700
And that's very satisfying, that's great,

745
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,900
because that's what we see

746
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,140
and that's what we apparently love

747
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,340
or have loved for the last couple of hundred years

748
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,260
and that's great.

749
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,860
However, it has, if you believe the theory,

750
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,660
this has a fatal flaw

751
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,740
and the fatal flaw is denoted by this line

752
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,900
and it's called in the technical language

753
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,460
a finite time singularity

754
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,020
and to put it in very simple language,

755
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,980
what it says is that in some finite time,

756
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,660
this damn growth curve will go to infinite size

757
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,380
and that's obviously impossible.

758
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,340
So this is kind of a Malthusian argument,

759
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,180
namely at some stage,

760
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,980
you're gonna run out of whatever it is

761
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,660
that's keeping the system alive,

762
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,300
the resources, the energy, whatever it is

763
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,220
and the theory tells you what happens,

764
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,180
it says as you go through this so-called singularity,

765
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,220
you stagnate and collapse.

766
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,500
That's terrible and we need to avoid that

767
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,340
and we have avoided it

768
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,100
and this is how we avoid it.

769
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,620
We avoid it for the very reason

770
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:27,620
that Malthus and Paul Ehrlich were rejected,

771
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,060
that is they did not take into account

772
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,780
the fact that we innovate ourselves out of these problems.

773
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,440
So I wanna finish on this note.

774
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,880
So here's the situation.

775
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,440
This is you start at some point and you start growing

776
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,040
and you would hit this singularity and collapse.

777
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,520
So somewhere along here,

778
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,840
you better change something

779
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,840
because this growth was done in the paradigm

780
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,600
of whatever the major innovation is.

781
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,120
It could be the discovery of iron,

782
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,680
could be the discovery of coal, could be oil,

783
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,760
it could be the invention of computers,

784
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,240
the invention of IT,

785
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,880
that's something major that has a kind of paradigm shift

786
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,920
and changes everything.

787
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,560
So this suggests that the way out of this dilemma

788
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,080
of collapse is that you innovate somewhere here

789
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,200
and you start over again.

790
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,800
You reset the clock and then you can go on merrily

791
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,640
and of course you're gonna hit

792
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,040
another finite time singularity and collapse

793
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,260
unless you innovate again.

794
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,560
So you have to keep innovating.

795
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,480
So there's a kind of theorem if you like

796
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,160
that if you want to continue to have open-ended growth,

797
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,920
you have to have cycles of innovation.

798
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,680
Well, people have been saying things like that

799
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,120
for a long time.

800
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,760
Here's the difference going back to what we said.

801
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,440
As you grow and you get bigger, the pace of life increases.

802
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,520
So first of all, the pace of life is increasing.

803
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,280
Second thing is it turns out the theory says,

804
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,800
yes, you can do this,

805
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,840
but the time to go from here to here necessarily

806
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,040
has to be and systematically shorter

807
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,840
than the time from here to here.

808
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,160
So that you can innovate,

809
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,920
you can have these cycles of innovation,

810
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,880
but they must come quicker and quicker.

811
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,760
So the image is that we're on this treadmill

812
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,360
that is going faster and faster,

813
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,240
which is difficult to begin with.

814
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,160
But at some stage you've got to jump from that treadmill

815
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,400
onto another treadmill that's going even faster.

816
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,920
And then very soon you've got to jump onto another one

817
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,800
and you've got to kind of keep doing this.

818
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,000
So you have this kind of double acceleration

819
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,200
and the question is,

820
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,640
do you suffer a kind of global heart attack from that?

821
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,680
So is this sustainable?

822
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,200
Obviously not, ultimately.

823
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,120
And here's, this is not mine at all.

824
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,040
This is someone I don't know who he is, but he did it

825
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,480
and he showed, you know, it was great.

826
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,600
Oh, this is something I saw in an English newspaper

827
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,320
a week ago, which I thought illustrated the point

828
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,160
a little bit.

829
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,200
So here's something, some of you may have heard

830
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,440
of the idea of singularity from this,

831
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,800
what I consider a little bit loony work of Ray Kurzweil.

832
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,920
I think this is loony,

833
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,520
but he did some wonderful things of collecting data.

834
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,200
I don't agree with a lot of this,

835
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,240
but what he's plotted here is that

836
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,840
here's the paradigm shift.

837
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,840
That is, how long it took to create each one

838
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,560
of these paradigms versus how long ago it happened.

839
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,080
Okay, so, and what you see is it takes shorter and shorter

840
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,680
times to make these shifts

841
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,800
and it's happening faster and faster.

842
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,200
And he drew this, he got them,

843
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
there's all kinds of people who've done things like this.

844
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,760
I'm gonna finish up.

845
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,720
And whoops.

846
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,560
And interestingly enough, that straight line,

847
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,440
if you take this theoretical framework

848
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,560
that I just told you about,

849
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,780
this continuous innovation and jumping

850
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,760
from one treadmill to another,

851
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,960
it predicts almost exactly that orange line.

852
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,880
So that's data kind of supporting it.

853
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,520
So I'm gonna finish with that

854
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,480
and I'm gonna finish with one last image,

855
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,240
which is this, just to give you a sense of things

856
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,120
in terms of energy, our metabolic rate,

857
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,760
I didn't point that out on the graph.

858
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,480
You remember that graph of metabolic rate?

859
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,080
Our metabolic rate in watts is about 90 watts,

860
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,920
a little bit less women versus men,

861
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,320
but roughly it's about 90 watts.

862
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,160
We're a light bulb.

863
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,640
One of the bloody light bulbs is equivalent to one of us.

864
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,400
So turning a light bulb off,

865
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,600
it's like your mother turning you.

866
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,360
If you turn it off, you help the starving people

867
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,280
in Sudan or somewhere.

868
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,640
So it's ridiculous having all these lights on, frankly.

869
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,480
They're us.

870
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,640
We are extraordinarily efficient.

871
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,720
That 1,800, 2,000 food calories a day

872
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,960
is unbelievably efficient.

873
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,800
May seem like a lot of food, but it's just a light bulb.

874
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,920
However, and incidentally,

875
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,240
that metabolic rate is the metabolic rate

876
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,880
we should have for a mammal of our size.

877
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,160
That's what we should have, okay?

878
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,960
And if you add in activity, hunting and gathering,

879
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,080
which is the way we evolve or versions thereof,

880
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,080
that number changes from 100 to about 250,

881
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,560
the amount of energy we do to hunt and gather and so on.

882
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,800
And that also scales the active metabolic rate for mammals.

883
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,600
So that's what we, quote, should have.

884
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,600
Then we started talking to one another.

885
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,720
We discovered economies of scale to form communities,

886
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,440
and then we started to innovate.

887
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,960
And once we innovated,

888
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,480
we created all of this around us,

889
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,680
all this wonderful quality of life and standard of living

890
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,560
that we'd like to have for everybody.

891
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,680
And we can ask, what is our real metabolic rate?

892
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,320
What is our social metabolic rate

893
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,880
of having cars and lights and buildings

894
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,560
and all the rest of the stuff?

895
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:06,560
That number goes from about 90 watts to 11,000 watts.

896
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,760
And you can turn it around,

897
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,400
as has been done on this graph as I did here,

898
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,200
and ask, how big is it?

899
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,680
What big an animal are we?

900
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,000
This is about a dozen elephants,

901
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,520
each one of us in this room.

902
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,920
And there are seven billion people of us on this planet

903
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,840
who all want to be like us,

904
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,440
and there's three billion more coming in the next 30, 40 years,

905
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,360
and they all want to be like us using 11,000 watts.

906
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,600
So this is an enormous problem,

907
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,640
and I cannot answer the question,

908
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,840
what is the future and what does it bring?

909
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,640
But I can say that I'm a pessimist.

910
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,000
So I'll finish on that.

911
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,840
Oh.

912
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,680
Thank you.

913
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,520
Thank you.

914
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,360
Thank you.
