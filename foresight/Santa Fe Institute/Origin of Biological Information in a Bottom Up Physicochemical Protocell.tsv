0	4000	He wasn't established a long time, his long career career back then is five.
4000	7520	He works on a whole bunch of physical principles related to origins of life,
7520	12000	pro-cells, after biology. It was his pleasure to have him here today, PhD.
12000	17520	Thank you. Yeah, it's certainly also, it's always wonderful to be back here and
17520	21440	nice to see a number of known faces and some new ones too.
22240	25680	Some of you know that I've been a bit obsessed with,
25680	30640	we're trying to create life in the lab for many years.
30640	35280	When I was younger, I thought I'd be long done by now, but it's not so easy.
36000	43920	So what I'll present here today is our latest work on computational work, theoretical work,
43920	49280	on the missing link to actually implement a living system in the lab.
49840	57280	And I want to emphasize my collaborators here, and we have Christopher Thompson
57280	62720	and Marco Toccio. They are two recent graduate students I've had, and you guys
62720	67760	of course know Artemis. He's been here for a long time at SFI.
67760	70880	Hansiak is an old friend from Los Alamos and Didliu.
71600	76640	Bornebush is also one of my previous graduate students.
76880	84640	So, I'll focus on the question of how to get information into a self-replicating
84640	89920	molecular machine. This has been an issue we haven't been able to solve experimentally yet.
91200	97200	So, if I can figure out, and it doesn't work this year,
97520	107920	I can also use this one here. So, I think that most of us would agree that
109440	113200	if we want to have a transition from non-living to living matter,
114400	122240	then it has to be characterized by the origin of some functional information that can
122480	130400	tell how to build this living matter. So, the goal is to demonstrate how particular
130400	136960	molecular reaction networks they can generate and store this kind of information.
139200	141520	I guess it looks smart, but it isn't.
142080	155280	So, my answer is to start with a metabolism. I think this is really the key, and I'll try to
155280	160880	argue for that, because there's still some discussion in the community about
161680	167360	what came first, the chicken on the egg here. It's clear that energy is needed and information
167440	171440	is needed. There has to be some kind of containment also, but I really think that
171440	180160	one should focus on the energetics in the beginning. So, imagine we have an energy gradient,
180160	186400	some free energy available. We can then use this free energy to turn resources into building blocks,
187200	194480	and the key is to have a catalyst that can be in more than one state. So, there can be a selection
194480	201440	of catalysts if these building blocks, they will actually also be, or one or more of them,
201440	206800	will be catalysts. So, we are in a situation where we provide energy from the environment,
207360	212960	so we start with resources, and then we end up with building blocks. Of course, the desired
212960	219440	situation is that we lift our building blocks up, so we get more complex building blocks that are
219440	228400	energetically higher up, but it's also okay if we can just make new materials by this process.
231200	236160	And of course, this is not clear why this is true, at least some people say it is not clear.
236160	242800	So, therefore, I've tried to state two questions here. Why focus on metabolism? Is metabolism
242800	249600	really primary to information since our topic is mainly information? And how is a good metabolic
249600	258160	catalyst selected and up-concentrated if you have a system like this here? Free energy available,
258160	262560	you use this energy to turn resources into building blocks, where one of the building blocks is
262560	271520	actually a catalyst that can catalyze its own formation. So, we have an order catalysis. And
271520	280640	for some of you, this is, you already know that, but I want to emphasize that if we look at a molecular
280640	289440	system that has different states, let's see that it has w different states, then we know from Boltzmann
289440	297040	that it can encode information to the amount of the equation of PIS, which is information is equal
297040	308560	to Boltzmann's constant and the natural logarithm of the possible states. And there is information
308560	316560	represented many places in living systems, the most well-known sequential equation, DNA, RNA,
316560	324640	proteins and so forth. But I want to emphasize that information can also be present as conformational
324640	332320	information where an aggregate can be composed of different components and then the how many
332320	340160	components and in high concentrations will also represent the information. This is the one Lancet
340160	346960	that has introduced that and sequential information like we have in DNA and RNA and proteins, etc.
346960	352160	That's a particular kind of compositional information. Compositional information is more
352720	368480	general. So if we take Boltzmann's equation and the fundamental first law or sorry second law
369200	377040	where we have that information or entropy here is equal to energy divided by t and then we insert
377040	387440	this fundamental equation from thermodynamics into Boltzmann's equation. We get an equation we see
387440	397520	here where we can eliminate or we can isolate e and then we get in a system where there are two
397520	404800	states, we get an energy that is this big. And this was Landau that I think was first in pointing
404800	414720	out that if you want to delete or create or store a bit of information there has to be
415280	425200	it costs you something and the cost is about if you put in the room temperature and the value
425200	432640	for the Boltzmann constant you get a small amount of energy. And I think this is a physics argument
432640	444240	for why one has to look at free energy before one can think about information. And this is of
444240	454000	course in line with all of our experiences whenever we have to write something we have to use energy
454000	463440	computers use energy transmission of information on cables and you know
463440	468480	satellites and what all of this is something we already know very well.
468480	477360	Oh biological systems they also require energy to the replication machinery is energetically
478240	483520	it needs energy. Can I ask you a question? Yeah yeah absolutely. So
487280	494560	it's interesting that you're using Landau's principle as this you know the argument for why
494560	501840	we need a metabolism. I mean I agree with all this but I just as far as I know I agree real
501840	508000	metabolism is many orders of magnitude above that in the amount of heat it releases per bit.
508880	515280	And so is that an indication that actually some other mechanism is making the metabolism
515280	523360	necessary than Landau's principle? No no this is just this is just to state I mean you guys most
523360	531680	of you are it's sort of you know preaching to the choir but for many people in the community
531680	536880	that are interested in these things it's not obvious and it'll be contested but I
536880	543520	know I think I know that I mean you need to use about two electron volts to split water
544400	552880	so you need much more energy to do to run chemical reactions and how exactly how the
552880	560480	relationship is between how much energy you have to to process or to run a chemical process
560480	566880	compared to how much information there is I I'll not get into that here. I'll sort of try to
566880	573360	put these two things together at the end. Yeah the ribosome which is running all these strings
573760	578480	is about four times off the Landauer bound so it's real and then that machine is about half
578480	582800	of cellular metabolism in bacteria so that's where one of these costs actually does get
582800	587760	scaled all the way up to sort of cellular scale. It's only about four times that? It's four times
587760	593920	that. Oh no I thought it was yeah hundreds or thousands of times. No no no it's not no
594640	600240	but it but it is I mean we have I don't think anybody has actually reached the this limit
600960	611280	has that been done I don't think so anyways so let's believe that we need to have free energy
611280	620160	before we can have information and so then if that's true then we can go to the next question
620160	627040	how is a metabolic catalyst selected and up concentrated because now we we agree that we
627120	635280	actually need free energy to generate this catalyst and I will I'll claim that a catalyst
635280	641760	is a sufficient condition for having a catalyst is that you have an energy transducer and a
641760	651520	combinatorial cofactor in chemistry you have you have catalyst that speed up chemical processes
652080	658720	and and if you have an energy transducer that's a that's a molecular machine that can turn
658720	663760	one kind of energy into another kind of energy we're going to focus on how we can turn light
663760	669920	energy into chemical energy and this can be modulated with a so-called cofactor and I'll get
669920	679840	into that later so we so that's number one we actually require or assume that this catalyst
679840	685520	is composed of an energy transducer and a combinatorial cofactor that can modulate it
686320	696560	and a cofactor can be it does need to but it can be an an electron donor or an electron receptor
696560	703840	depending on how the system is made up so that depending on how how well it donates electrons
703840	710400	to to this energy transduction machinery the process will run faster or slower
713440	721440	and if we also want this catalytic cofactor to be replicated then the question is how how is
721440	727600	that possible I mean how what what kind of systems can both satisfy the first one that we have
728320	734000	the catalyst being in a energy transducer and a combinatorial cofactor and it can also be
734000	740400	replicated and and now as we go on I have to emphasize that I'm not trying to solve the
740400	745840	origins of life I mean the historical origins of life here on earth we're just trying to create
745840	754720	life in the lab from from non-living materials so so um so how do we think about this I mean we
755520	761360	we've tried a number of different things and this is sort of the workhorse that we are currently
762240	768560	believing in where we have a um you can see over here we have we have a
769440	776080	vesicle fatty acid vesicle and on on this exterior of this vesicle we have anchored
777200	783440	an energy transducer this is a ruthenium complex with a with a tail a hydrophobic tail
783440	792240	and then we have a DNA duplex which is a cofactor so so here we have we have a sort of a blow-up
792240	801040	up here we have the energy transducer and and it it's composed of both this molecular system that
801040	810240	can capture light and and and then a a energy transducer that can deliver an electron and
810240	817040	we have a little blue indication up here because it turns out that depending on what kind of
817680	825280	bases we have in a DNA or an RNA or a pna strand uh we will have a good or a bad
826640	833760	cofactor so so we have the we have this as a ruthenium complex and up here we have an oxygoinine
833760	843440	because oxygoinine is a very good or reasonably good uh electron donor um so how how so how can
843440	850240	this work i mean what what what does it do and and also how is how is this cofactor actually
850240	857520	able to replicate because we know that replication without enzymes is is very very difficult can
857520	862320	ask a question absolutely yeah i'm curious why you chose DNA instead of RNA since
863520	871040	on auto catalysis has been RNA yeah that's more likely to auto-catalyze than DNA well it's simply
871040	878720	because we uh DNA is much easier to work with it's much cheaper and and and if you look at
878720	885600	charge transfer which we will focus on here it it's it's more difficult to do charge transfer
885600	892400	in RNA than it is in DNA DNA literally thousands of papers out on charge transfer of DNA and all
892400	898240	all kinds of different so so we and the reason why we're using ruthenium is also because it's the most
898240	905840	studied uh uh energy transducer photo photocatalysis there is so so that's why the chemists they've
905840	918240	chosen they've chosen that so just to indicate what we mean by this protocell and to to be
918240	923440	interesting it has to go through a life cycle so remember before this was a protocell that
923440	929520	is composed of in principle three different components the membrane i mean the vesicle
930240	937600	uh this energy transducer and the cofactor then we feed the system with an oily substance
938800	946560	that will then go into the membrane this is pigolinium ester and we can then by
949040	958320	illuminating the system turn pigolinium ester into fatty acid and then that means that we get more
958320	964320	membrane and as the membrane expands then the protocell gets gets bigger eventually if you
964320	970160	run the process long enough then it will get unstable and it will divide and not in a controlled
970160	979520	way but you'll get spotting events so as we do that or as this metabolic process runs we also
979520	989440	provide a small oligomers which are pieces of DNA and they will then template if we make sure that
989440	995680	this DNA has some certain properties which we'll get into a little later it has to have
997360	1003520	it has to have deletions and imperfections so it doesn't glue too strongly together so it's not
1003520	1010720	hybridized too strongly then we can actually get a replication of these of these cofactors
1011280	1018720	and then over time you'll eventually end up with with two or more sometimes not it doesn't divide
1018720	1023520	but on average you actually do get more of these aggregates
1024160	1028160	so
1031040	1037840	how I promise to talk a little bit about how we can actually modulate a metabolism with the with
1037840	1044720	the DNA yeah we've done a number of we've done experimental and theoretical work on this for
1044720	1055600	many years this was our first life cycle of a of a protocell it was Mauer's PhD thesis
1056720	1063440	where she demonstrated it where we actually have yeah anyways we we yeah it goes I don't want to
1063440	1068560	get into details but we can actually show that that that you can that these that these vesicles
1068560	1075680	they can grow and divide and by keep feeding this the guillenium ester we can actually get the system
1075680	1083280	to generate more and more of these of these vesicles but here we don't have a replicating
1085520	1093200	DNA strand we only have oxo guanine as a as an electron donor there isn't any so there isn't any
1093200	1097680	inheritance so we have to provide new oxo guanine all the time
1100320	1109840	so how how does it actually work if we want to have and have this process to to to act or have
1109840	1124480	have this cofactor to act as a as a as a modulator and so here is the surface of the membrane the
1124480	1131840	fatty acids are the green ones and the blue ones these are these oily the guillenium esters and as
1131840	1140720	you illuminate the ruthenium complex which actually intercalates the self-assembles into the into
1140720	1150160	the DNA then what happens is that you will steal this once once it gets activated it will steal a
1150960	1159200	an electron from a guanine that is sitting in in the vicinity because once it gets activated then
1159200	1168640	an electron jumps from the ruthenium metal out to one of these bipyridine antennas here
1168640	1175520	and and then it'll steal an electron from the strand so now there is a hole there's a missing
1175520	1183360	electron and it'll diffuse up and down the strand until it eventually will be absorbed by the oxo
1183360	1191040	guanine and as we have an energy rich electron here it's been banged out there by the light
1191680	1200000	then this electron can actually be used to to deprotect a picolinium ester and turn it into a
1200000	1208560	fatty acid it needs to have a we need to have a sacrificial proton donor and then this process
1208560	1214960	will go and then we don't we don't like to have a damage the oxo guanine so we need to have a the
1214960	1223440	same what's it called or a proton donor here but at the end of the day we actually convert
1224320	1230720	this oily substance into membrane so the system grows and this is modulated by the
1230720	1239200	strand here because if if we can't if we can't get get rid of the hole then this this ruthenium
1239200	1246480	complex is sort of say on it's not usable for one for one for the next for the next time
1247760	1252320	it has to be you know it has to be it has it needs to have this electron back
1252880	1259680	so what we've done here is looked at this process and tried to calculate
1261440	1264640	how the strands they how well the strands they
1266240	1273200	conduct these holes depending on the sequence and unfortunately that if you go to the literature
1273200	1279680	I mean we don't have the measurements for that it's not all transition states that's
1280400	1284960	actually published we don't know what the rate constants are from all these different
1285680	1291280	combinations this is what we were able to to find and we had to we had to guesstimate some of them
1291280	1300240	ourselves and these are either direct measurements or they are of an issue calculations I mean where
1300240	1309280	you have quantum calculations of of of this system so we have the rates from for instance going from
1310640	1317840	from an a to an a or from an from a g to an a etc and you can then you if you want to simulate
1317840	1327520	such a system you can set up the matrix like this and you will then have the these rate constants
1327520	1336560	they will determine how likely it is for you to go from one state to the other and mostly
1336560	1342880	you see off diagonal you have diffusion and then every once in a while they are actually what we
1342880	1350160	call super exchange where if you have a gc pair and then you have a gc pair a little I mean a
1350160	1356400	couple of of three sides four sides further down you can actually have the hole to to tunnel
1357520	1363760	the quantum tunnel for one from one to the next so what we've done we've first we looked at all
1363760	1369200	these rates and when we realized we couldn't just we couldn't make all the rates on one hand they
1369200	1374320	are all the sequences in the world on the one hand that was good because we didn't have simulation
1374320	1383520	time to to simulate strands I think we we go on now I know we go up to about 18 strands of 18
1384480	1389520	that's what's been we've also done experiments and other has done experiments with and if you
1390160	1398960	take what what we know here and you then do the actually do the counting you can only construct
1398960	1405840	or you can at most construct 160 strands so what we've done we have constructed these 160
1405840	1411840	strands and then we've done the simulations we've then found these medium first passage
1411840	1424960	time for the hole to to get up to the to the octagon and and and also we actually also
1424960	1433040	calculated the the the mean there's a little bit of difference but how experimented what's it
1434160	1440240	you said that you found mean first medium first passage time how did you find it
1440320	1446240	no this was this was this is calculations these are calculations all of these transition
1446240	1453600	this transition constants they are found either experimentally or they are found with first or
1453600	1460240	I mean with with the quantum mechanical calculations or a couple of them we had to
1460880	1465760	guesstimate because we couldn't find them in the literature but they probably are known I
1465760	1472320	don't know it best to like 10 percent but for instance here you've said you know times like
1472320	1480480	this 10 digits not 10 but five digits so is it just for fun what is for fun for instance this
1480480	1488000	tau you've you said you know something with like four significant digits so five significant digits
1488000	1494880	and this numbers you know rates you probably know with I don't know five percent ten percent
1495280	1499440	oh yeah oh yeah I know don't know this don't worry about that yeah yeah no no no we don't know
1499440	1505920	this should yeah no no no yeah so so so that that's just what that's what what the computer cranked
1505920	1512960	out no no don't worry about all the all the digits there we are we just know what the order of magnitude
1512960	1523200	is and that's it we cannot count on more any other questions yeah I don't understand right
1523200	1528960	the idea here is to understand the timing it takes to saturate the electrons being trapped in the
1528960	1535920	eight oxo yeah and then but yeah but then what limits you're assuming 18 base pairs of length
1536960	1543040	these could grow I assume and no no no no no you have you have just think about think about uh
1543040	1548800	don't think about any changes just think about a DNA yeah a duplex that has a certain length
1548800	1554160	you can then place the oxygorne in different different different locations and you can you
1554160	1561120	can then also have different ATs or GCs but then I'm thinking in your system you need the DNA to
1561120	1566160	self replicate yeah okay that comes later they come longer than 18 base pairs no we don't we
1566160	1571360	don't allow it to get longer because we we feed it with with with the pieces so we can make sure
1571360	1575840	that it doesn't get any longer but that's that's sort of the that's that's actually the next step
1575840	1583520	here you're too fast so so just to to show here what we got out of that so this is the histogram
1583520	1591040	of all the of all the simulations this is where we have the slow ones is when we have the oxygorne
1591040	1598960	above the ligation side and and this is the fast ones when we have the oxygorne below the ligation
1598960	1603840	side that means it's close to the to the ruthenium complex which makes sense and then there's a
1603840	1609520	bunch in the middle where it's more complicated what's happening so so that's the result of our
1609520	1617760	our simulations now obviously there's much more going on than just charged charged transferred
1617760	1624480	in the DNA if you look at this this is a I think we've gotten pretty much all of the reactions
1624480	1632880	in here for our metabolism this is the ruthenium complex in ground state it's activated by light
1632960	1640480	and then it can either jump back again or you can actually deliver this energized electron to
1641920	1650080	to the to the DNA and you can then have the charge run up to the to the oxygorne you then
1650800	1658160	destroy or you modify the what's it called the the oxygorne it actually loses a hydrogen
1658160	1664880	atom and you then have to repair it and then you go around in this in this cycle here and
1664880	1675200	then downstream as you as you go down to the ground state here with with the ruthenium
1675200	1685520	then you can use this energy to convert picolinium ester into a into into a lipid into a fatty acid
1686000	1692320	the canoic acid and and I don't want to get into all the details but we've started that both
1692320	1699840	experimentally and and computationally theoretically and I so we know this system fairly well although
1699840	1705360	all of the constants reaction constants are not known we they're not verified experimentally but
1705360	1711920	you can when you simulate the system you can have some bounce on them in any way if you look at how
1712720	1720800	look at the what determines the time for recharging the ruthenium complex
1722160	1730720	this circular reaction is determined by the charge transfer reaction constant so
1732000	1740000	if you want to to ensure that the charge transfer is is not too slow then we can figure out I mean
1740400	1750800	there is we have this this rate that that is the excitation and then we have the
1751520	1757280	a number of things that's going on up here but the time it takes is one over the rate
1757280	1764640	plus the time it takes going around here and then we have a rate sort of a composed rate for the whole
1764640	1772400	thing and if we say that we only allow the the charge transfer to slow the system with
1773040	1781120	50 percent or with 10 percent or 1 percent we can we can actually get a bound on on this rate and
1781120	1789520	we say that we only allow it to reduce the recharge with 1 percent and that means that we have a
1789520	1797200	a rate constant in this charge transport to be that it has to be larger than
1798240	1805040	five per sorry 50 per second and we'll require that for the as we go forwards
1807760	1816480	any question yeah and it this this is this is complicated so now we go to what you asked with
1816560	1824640	the replication how does that work and and the main sort of break that that the community got was
1824640	1834960	with juliane gibbs she and her groups they figured out a way to to actually replicate
1835280	1846080	DNA without enzymes by doing a a ligation reaction and and making sure that we don't have
1846640	1853280	product inhibition and and the community has sort of been has been struggling i mean i had
1853280	1860080	to pay several phd students we weren't able to solve it and i mean many many many people have
1860080	1872880	tried to do DNA or RNA amplification with without luck and and it turns out that if you make if you
1872880	1881440	make mismatches or bulges or air bases add that to the DNA strand you can actually get
1881680	1893760	it exponential amplification by by by by having having these errors in in the DNA and and she
1893760	1902240	calls it the lesion induced DNA amplification and and if you just look at it here then
1902240	1911280	then we have some mismatches or some a basis that means it could be where there's no
1912640	1920240	actually there's no base at all it's just a backbone and if you have have this destabilized
1920240	1928320	enough then there is enough breathing in this short system so that when you feed it with with
1928320	1934080	these resource strands here and provide an extra ruthenium complex you will actually be able to get
1934720	1940880	and replication so that's how the replication happens and this has been demonstrated in the
1940880	1947600	in the lab many many times many groups nobody so far has done it while the DNA has been anchored so
1947600	1953440	that's something that has to be done yeah you start with mismatched yeah that's how this works but
1953440	1960960	do you end up with a product that's mismatched yes interest because else you can't you can you can
1960960	1967200	dehybridize interest so else you and that's that then you get a product inhibition so this is the
1967200	1973840	main the main that that's the main i mean this is the the ingenious thing that that uh uh julie
1974400	1981760	gives she did anyway so at the end of the the day we have a cofactor replication
1983360	1992320	so now we can write down the reaction diagram you can see that here and then you end up with
1993440	1999520	15 coupled ordinary differential equations i've written the first two ones there are 13 more
1999520	2006880	and what's interesting here is if you look at the all the reactions almost all of them are of this
2006880	2013920	form where you have two two reactions that turns into a third one or you have and all of it is
2014720	2020640	reversible except the ligation part where you actually glue these at the backbone together
2021360	2028160	and then we know from the ratio relationship between Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium
2028240	2034880	constant here this is something you've learned in in college chemistry if you then know
2036080	2041600	one of these either the forward or the backwards rate then you can actually and you know the the
2041600	2047520	free energy associated with the hybridization then you can find the off rate and turns out the on
2047520	2053760	rate is much faster than the off rate i mean much much faster and it doesn't depend much about it
2053760	2061360	doesn't depend that much on the sequence details so if we for the sake of simplicity assume that
2061360	2070880	it's constant then we can find the off rate by by sorry if we know this one and if we know the
2070880	2077760	delta g and delta g is we've taken from santa lucía and hicks there they made this monumental
2077760	2084000	work where they actually figured out how to calculate this free energy but also use there's a
2084000	2092880	lot of online tools like a new pack that gives you gives you the the free energy and actually
2092880	2097920	turns out that depending on what you're using you always get differences it's still there's still
2097920	2104080	a little bit of of what's it called art and i don't think they've really nailed it down but
2104080	2111680	anyways that's how we can we can figure out what the rate constants are by when we have the sequence
2111680	2121680	then we can calculate the off rates so the results here are given to the left so we get
2121680	2129760	replication rates and they're sort of all over the place in in this range here again this is the
2129760	2138720	logarithm we are using and and what we have to compare here is when we do these experiments
2140320	2148480	to do the ligation we need to have one of the ends energize with imidazole and that actually
2149360	2155360	decays in water it falls apart in water so if you can't wait forever because else the system will
2155360	2162880	simply die and the rate is i think the the place where they found the highest rate was about 10 to
2162880	2172640	the minus 5 10 to the minus 5 per second so it's a relatively slow rate and we just we decide that
2172640	2178720	we want to have a replication rate that it's at least one order of magnitude faster so we say
2178720	2186560	that replication rate has to be higher than 10 to the minus 4 and that's here so we these guys are
2186560	2194320	okay so there's a few of them that will be they'll be disqualified now to make simple to make things
2194320	2200080	simple we've actually assumed that this happened and bought and not on a surface at an interface
2200080	2207520	now we did do interface calculation then you have to adjust some of the rates and it turns out that
2207520	2212720	it's at least an order of magnitude the collision rate is at least an order of magnitude faster
2213520	2218800	if you do it on the surface but since there are many other reactions involved it's not
2218800	2224800	that that big of a difference and this is assuming there's no crowding if you have too many molecules
2224800	2230800	i actually don't know what happens if there's a crowding but we've also that's a whole other
2230800	2237040	story we we've made we actually made a model we this is a sipping graph model where we can
2237040	2243840	where we can take into account how it went when they collide on the surface how they actually
2243840	2250160	also involved how depending on on this on what sequence details you have then sometimes you'll
2250160	2256080	sliding and mismatches it takes a while for it to find the the the final situation so you can
2256080	2262080	actually do the ligation but that's a different story but i think that it is true i believe
2262080	2273120	that it is faster on the surface than it is in bulk so now we've done a study of charge transfer
2273120	2279920	or charge transport on the dna we found out how fast or how slow we will allow the system to be
2280000	2286400	and we've also done replication studies figure out you know of these 160 strands that we
2287200	2293200	we have started which ones are fast enough etc so another question is of course how
2294720	2301200	what does that mean for the for a protocell how do we combine these findings and that's the
2303840	2309200	the last question namely try to figure out i mean how can the combined charge transport and
2309200	2318720	replication process support a protocell life cycle so the first thing the easiest thing to do
2318720	2327040	is to look at simply map these two our findings out on two different in a coordinate system
2327040	2334000	where we have the the sorry the charge transfer rate on the the logarithm to the charge transfer
2334000	2343520	rate on the x-axis and this is the logarithm of the of the replication rate constant on the y-axis
2343520	2352400	and then we we had these as we had these requirements that we need to have the the this
2352400	2363600	this charge transfer to be faster than than than 50 per second and the replication rate has to be
2363600	2370000	faster than 10 to the minus 5 10 to the minus 4 per second so so we are good with replication in
2370000	2376720	the blue area and we are good with with charge transfer in the reddish or light right red area
2376720	2383120	and this area out here is then the sweet area this is where both things are are satisfied
2384160	2396160	one thing i didn't discuss earlier is that for to have a good coupling between i mean for for
2396240	2403040	selection and replication we we it's you you want to have your dna to replicate
2406320	2412880	and not just be the resource pieces that can actually run the metabolism so if you think
2412880	2419680	about if you have a an oxygrenine right next to the right next to the surface of the vesicle
2419680	2425200	in one of the pieces one of the resource pieces you give the system then you don't need to have any
2425200	2430640	replication to actually run the metabolism because the the the oxygrenine can communicate
2430640	2436480	directly with the ruthenium complex you want to have the oxygrenine higher up so you need to have
2436480	2446240	have a charge transfer in in in the duplex in in this pipe stacking that you have inside the
2446240	2453840	dna what these what this charge transfer can happen so so all the the the round one the circles
2453840	2462720	they have they have the um they have the oxygrenine above the ligation site i mean higher up on the
2462720	2469200	dna away from from from the surface and all the triangles they have it very close to the surface
2469920	2477600	so so in a way we we uh these are the fastest ones but we don't like them because it doesn't
2477600	2486080	connect the two things very well but anyways it's it was kind of surprising to us that 63 out of these
2486080	2492880	160 test the strands they actually satisfy these conditions so that's uh that means that we if we
2492880	2500880	just make strands we should we should be possible for us to uh to actually make it work so the next
2500960	2507600	i'm going to tell you is is i'm not sure how much um how relevant it is for for the experiments but
2507600	2516480	i couldn't help doing it um and because you have you have the uh the these two mechanisms you have
2516480	2522400	the replication and you have the charge transfer and is there a sort of a mathematical way to connect
2522400	2530320	these two and it turns out that we a long time ago while i was still here still living here in in
2530320	2536480	Santa Fe um we actually did a study it was a grad no it's actually a grad undergraduate his name
2536480	2543120	is Tristan uh he did this here where we looked at a system where uh we have a single stranded
2544640	2551200	a dna or a template and we have an we have oligomers you can then make duplexes um
2552000	2558400	because they they uh they hybridize they are ligated and then they can uh separate against
2558400	2565760	you have two single stranded uh dna and then you have precursor lipids i mean oily substance
2565760	2573920	that that together with the duplex here um is able to to to make lipids so that's a these are sort of
2573920	2581280	the much simplified much more simplified system um where we have separated we earlier you know
2581280	2586080	previous work here earlier today we looked at this separately and this separately here we can
2586080	2595040	solve these two things uh together and and it's not so simple because we have to look at uh you
2595040	2601440	have to distinguish between the global concentration and the concentration of substances in these small
2601440	2608400	protocells on the surfaces so you have the local concentration of the template um and then what is
2608400	2615600	the volume of of the of the protocell container of the the surface and this is a number of of
2615600	2622560	protocells you have in the system that gives you the global the global concentration of of your
2623120	2631440	of your templates to give an example so it takes a little bit of of manipulation but you can get
2632000	2639760	get these equations out one for the uh for the production of of templates and one for the production
2639760	2646560	of the aggregates and in this you have a a replication rate and you have this metabolic rate
2646560	2653200	which i mean the metabolic rate is includes this charge transfer and it turns out that these two
2653200	2659840	equations if you if you divide this one with this one you get a Bernoulli equation that can
2659920	2666960	actually be solved analytically and um you can then if you do that uh you can then get a doubling
2666960	2673680	time expressed with all these things here and that means that you you actually if you look at it here
2673680	2681600	you have a a doubling time then you have to switch it around the to the reciprocal uh expression
2681600	2689920	so you get you get this k t squared and you have the uh the k sorry where is it and k l that's in
2689920	2698320	in uh that's in the first order and then this will be uh uh to one-third so so this if you want to
2698320	2706720	to uh to make a combined um fitness function or whatever you want to call it a gross rate function
2707520	2714880	then it will the best guess that we could come up with is using what we know from from this system
2714880	2720640	which is very similar although a simplification we will then have to multiply these two guys
2721440	2732320	with different with broken with broken exponents so if we do that and then we order our
2732560	2741360	uh our sequences again um where we we rank them from the worst to the best we get uh
2741920	2748720	yeah well it's yeah some kind of theoretical fitness uh coefficient for for for the system here
2751520	2759760	and you can see that it has it has the same shape as you can see here here they're sort of
2759760	2766720	they're they're civil they're these three uh plateaus of three different regimes uh if you
2766720	2774480	just go back here that's yeah so since i'm i can't follow some of the chemical details
2775280	2781360	is is the is this your design process for coming up with these sequences or is this a fitness
2781360	2789520	landscape that you're hoping these protocells cells mutate and and improve on so so so
2789920	2793920	this is more this particular thing i was i was debating whether i wanted to
2793920	2799200	you know include it or not because this is just for for i think this is more an intellectual
2799200	2805520	exercise because we we believe that this is the shape of a fitness function but since we
2806080	2811600	we've just taken these two constants there was many more constants or there are many more
2811600	2816720	parameters involved in the other system but i think that that will be sort of the functional form
2816720	2823920	um but you cannot make any quantitative uh assessments from from this uh to to the to the
2823920	2831520	real system but but ultimately is this is this sort of consideration what you're using to design
2831520	2839680	the best sequence or or are you hoping that the protocells will mutate and that the sequence of
2839680	2845520	the highest metabolic rate will take the population so so so here from we already know
2845520	2851680	which is uh which is a good uh uh charge transfer i mean you want to be up here because then you're
2851680	2858400	both good at charge charge transfer and you're good at replication so so you want to uh experimentally
2858400	2864960	want to you want to pick uh some of these sequences here and then uh once you've picked a sequence i
2864960	2869920	mean just there'll be a big party if we get it to work i mean if the system can just replicate
2870000	2877440	and and not die um then we can feed the system with the pieces of sequences that are better we
2877440	2884400	our calculations predict are better and if that's indeed true then we'll see a takeover of this of
2884400	2890320	the new co-factor and then there'll be another party so does that make sense
2890320	2903440	let's say the the the evolution isn't taking place through mutation exactly no no no i did
2903440	2908880	you you're feeding it like different oligomers yeah so so it can pick from different oligomers
2908880	2914880	and the i mean these oligomers they'll form uh they'll form these duplexes that are then
2914880	2920240	cofactors and the ones with a good co co-factor will uh i'll compete the other one yeah on the
2920240	2926480	same topic you design the oligomers so that they have the imperfections yes you need to do that
2926480	2932160	else we can't else we can't unless you so you play god you have to oh yeah with the imperfections
2932160	2936720	yes because otherwise you don't get that that's right that's right yeah no no we we have to i mean
2936720	2942400	in these are new imperfections because you break the molecule at the first imperfection right and
2942400	2947520	then it's gonna anneal again at the same imperfection so you have to you have to create a new
2947520	2952880	imperfection in what you're feeding with or no we just we just make sure that there are mismatches
2952880	2959280	or there is a basis in the right places matches what's that that there's some mismatch yeah there
2959280	2965120	has to be and and they can't well depending on where you put the mismatches it works well it
2965120	2971920	doesn't work very well so so there is a number of details that that i i don't think well i can
2971920	2977280	say one thing for sure that right at the ligation side that's where you have need to have a bulge
2977280	2983680	or a an airbase because without doing that you you won't you you will not prevent
2985520	2992800	what's it called product inhibition but but where you put the other mismatches depends on the rest
2992800	3000160	of this of the sequence for instance if you have lots of AT's they're weak compared to GC's so then
3000240	3006640	you if you have if you have sort of a GC heavy sequence you need to have more mismatches than
3006640	3014880	if you have an AT heavy sequence and and the ultimate goal here is that so that you ensure
3014880	3024000	growth of the lipid and the DNA and the little energy molecule at the first order rate kind of
3024000	3030960	over time you you ensure that that's the goal yeah the goal is to just have the have all the pieces
3030960	3035920	to play together no nobody has done that so far and that would be that'll be fantastic and then
3035920	3044160	i think that if we can make that play in the lab then i think to actually see a see an evolutionary
3044160	3050240	takeover will not be so hard i mean the difficult thing is to see whether this can actually work
3050240	3060160	just want to show one more fun thing here so yeah i think this is theoretically interesting
3060160	3067440	i don't think it helped us much too in the lab but here's another thing that this was
3067440	3073200	Artemis he pointed out that it's actually interesting to to look at the functional
3073200	3078000	information it's not easy to calculate the functional information in in real molecular
3078000	3086320	systems but in this system it is easy because we we can we can this is a hasten hasten's paper
3086320	3092960	we used or his idea i guess it's from a show stack originally but anyways we can we can calculate
3094320	3099120	the probability that we have a strand if you pick a strand at random from these
3100000	3106400	what is it hundred and and 60 strands i get yeah you know it's 160 strand so what is the chance that
3107280	3113280	it satisfies this condition divided by the total number of strands that gives you the
3113280	3118080	probability that you pick a strand that's good enough for a charge transfer you can do the same
3118080	3125200	for replication and you can ask for both of them to be fulfilled and then you have the probability
3125200	3132320	for that and then we can calculate the computation the compositional functional information by
3133280	3141280	taking the the logarithm minus the logarithm and then simply calculates these and then
3142000	3145840	we'll get these results out and if you look at it here
3152400	3160160	we have calculated the oh yeah so this is a functional information from for the charge transfer
3160160	3167120	process where we have again ranked them so we've said the bad ones first and they get better and
3167120	3176400	better and better and better and they will then level out up here at about 2.32 bits because
3176400	3182160	we have 32 strands that have identical charge transfer rates so that's why it stops there
3182880	3188480	it's a little bit different over here for the replication but if you do the calculation you get
3188880	3196720	just one point 34 bits for for of information is necessary to ensure
3196720	3202480	growths about self-sustaining so it's not very much information but again there were 63 strands
3202480	3210880	out of these 160 that satisfied our our goal so i'm sorry yeah experimental what this plots
3211680	3218000	they will stay cases you got this howl from experimental no no no this is this is from
3218000	3226560	by taking by ranking um uh by by simply calculating the this is the the functional
3226560	3235760	information here by by calculating the functional information uh then then you you'll have as you
3235760	3243120	go through the strands then as you get better and better strands uh there'll be fewer you have
3243120	3249680	to be more and more lucky to pick the right strands and if then rank order them you get a staircase
3249680	3257760	like that does that make sense what do you what do you say yes going back to chris's question
3257760	3264080	if you did this as a full population explicit evolutionary situation you'd say the strands
3264160	3269440	that survived only gained 1.34 bits over the strands that didn't survive everything
3269440	3275840	sort of like the information dealt yes yes yes yes but but there will be but there will be a
3275840	3280320	even though you just make it over the threshold then there'll be some that are better than just
3280320	3286160	doing the threshold so so you can then calculate what that is i mean this is the threshold for
3286720	3294480	for for these 50 per second for the for the charge transfer and and this is the one for the
3294480	3304000	replication over here so are you maybe we can talk about it afterwards how we how we do this
3304000	3312560	but it is it's it's really not it's very simple you just you just take the you just rank order
3313040	3318880	um how much information there is as you improve as you improve the strands
3321040	3326960	and and so this is the best ones they are the ones that are fastest here okay so
3329040	3339760	so hypothetically what we want is to set up a chemostat where we put in resources and then
3339760	3346640	we have a certain outflow rate and so this is the inflow rate this is the outflow rate
3347440	3354000	and we have to know the hydrolysis of all these processes or all the the products or the the
3354000	3362320	i'm sorry the the input and and and these are then the fitness rank cofactors and and this is
3362320	3368160	where we've used we can think about it from from what we calculated earlier and these are the
3368160	3375840	resources these are the different types of oligomers in the system as well as as a picolinium
3375840	3383520	ester and we have to have this proton donor etc etc and we then get i mean you are probably
3383520	3393760	familiar with these with these chemostat equations and you then get if you look at the biomass we
3393760	3401120	then get a transition for life where these where this is fulfilled and and i think what's interesting
3401120	3408800	is that it's extremely important it's not just the um the the what's it called the gross factors
3408800	3416320	or the fitness function you you have to look at what the degradation rates and then as you can
3416320	3422800	see the rest of it is actually environmental parameters which are really important and then
3422800	3430800	to end up here we have a so that's i guess our perspective on on what what's going on
3430800	3438240	where we have a if this is again lined up where we take the strands the cofactor with higher and
3438240	3446560	higher fitness so so once you are below this self-maintaining threshold you will be flushed out by
3446560	3455280	the chemostat but if once you're above it then you'll actually have a biomass existing in terms of
3455280	3461760	protocells and if you just pick these strands at random and provide them then it'll probably be
3462640	3469920	you know a discontinuous there'll be discontinuous jumps if you if you put them in sort of one
3469920	3473600	after the other with the one is a little bit better then it'll be approached or it'll be
3473600	3479760	approximated with that with a continuous curve so you know i know that the literature people talk
3479760	3487520	about whether you can view the transition to life as a first or a second order phase transition in
3487520	3493680	biomass and i think you can you can you can do both here and also the the same will be true this is
3493680	3502720	our it's just a symbolic representation of the functional information here and yeah this is where
3502720	3510320	once once you actually have a cofactor that's able to support this protocell life cycle then
3510320	3517840	you have the possibility of starting to to select information or store and select information
3517840	3527360	once the co cofactor doesn't provide you fast enough metabolism and fast enough replication
3527360	3530560	then the system will just be flushed out
3536880	3543840	so so what did we get out of this study i mean i i was you know you go in there and you don't know
3543840	3548320	what well i didn't know anything about charge transfer my my graduate student denied us so we
3548320	3555200	had to we had to take a crash course and that and and many people are real specialists they all said
3555200	3560320	oh we have to do quantum calculations of initial calculation but if we did that you know we'd have
3560320	3567840	to occupy one of the big machines for for weeks for for making a calculation of a single duplex
3567840	3573760	and we wanted to have an ensemble to figure out you know what what what the differences were so
3573760	3581120	that was why we we did this this differential equation approach instead but the most important
3581120	3589120	thing is that we can't really reject that this will work i mean along the way when we've
3590160	3594720	tried to implement this a living system in the lab from time to time we've
3595280	3600320	has either been impossible experimentally or we've figured out that we hadn't thought about
3600320	3607440	enough and theoretically we we made a boo boo but here it seems like 30 or 63 of them are actually
3607440	3614080	okay and then there are some assumptions that i think is important we have assumed that we have
3614080	3621520	super exchange uh across the bulge across this uh ligation site we couldn't figure out whether
3621520	3627760	this is indeed true or not uh we couldn't find any literature on it we did assume that it is possible
3627760	3633920	if it is not possible then we need to use uh we need to put our oxygen in just below the
3633920	3638880	ligation side so that you need to still have a hybridization you need to have a duplex
3639760	3645760	for for having the charge transferred to to actually work and another important
3646480	3651120	approximation is that we don't have any interactions between the charge transport and the
3651120	3657840	replication dynamics or the environment so we are sort of using a super a simple superposition
3657840	3662960	of the two and of course a more comprehensive simulation that's much more complicated would
3662960	3667360	take all these things into consideration but we didn't dare to venture into that
3668400	3674000	so so i think these are the two most important uh sort of simplifications and and then of course
3674000	3681200	the main issue here is to hopefully convince a sponsor that we can we can test this in the lab
3682640	3683040	thank you
3690560	3691040	questions
3692960	3703840	else i'll be around until uh May 8th so we can talk if you have questions
