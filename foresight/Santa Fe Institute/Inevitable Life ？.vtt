00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So, of course, it's a great pleasure to introduce my colleague today, Eric Smith.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Partly because he's not just a colleague, he's a friend of mine, and he's a collaborator at the Institute.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight's lecture, as you know, is on the topic of life, the inevitability of life,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
and its origins in relation to geochemistry.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Now, one of the unfortunate tendencies of the human mind is to think categorically,

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
to think in terms of dichotomies, living, non-living, conscious, not conscious, good and evil.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
But, of course, the world is not categorical, it's more continuous.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
And, of course, this tendency to categorise extends to institutions, departments, physics departments,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
biology departments, literature departments, architecture departments.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
And for those of you who've been coming to these public lectures, you will know that the Santa Fe Institute often stands in opposition

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
to a rather simple-minded categorisation of the world, both institutional, intellectual and metaphysical.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Now, the topic of life, of course, derives some of its charge from the sort of categorical,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
dichotomous opposition it stands in relation to the inanimate world, to non-life.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
And I want you to read you a quick quote from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
This is a preface that she wrote to the book in 1818.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
So, presumably, she couldn't get a word in.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed and, among others, the nature of the principle of life.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
And whether there was any possibility or probability of its ever being discovered and communicated, perhaps a corpse would be reanimated,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Galvanism had given a token of such things.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Galvanim, of course, being the application of current to muscles and their subsequent contraction.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
And, of course, there are other stories like that of the Gollum.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
The Gollum is mentioned in the Talmud, where Adam, in fact, was first a Gollum made from dust,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and the famous Gollum, of course, of Prague, the 16th-century Rabbi Low,

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
who constructed a creature to work on the Sabbath out of the mud of the banks of the River Volta in Prague.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And, of course, more recently, computer viruses, which some people think are alive.

02:15.000 --> 02:26.000
Now, all of these narratives, Frankenstein, viruses, and the Gollum, life springs from physical and chemical processes.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It doesn't spring from existing life.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
It's not like birth, where living things spawn living things.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
These are non-living things, spawning living things.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
At some point in the history of the earth, presumably there was no biology,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
and some disposition of chemistry and physics gave rise to biology and the subsequent evolution of life.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And these are the things that Eric's going to talk about.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Now, Eric has done his fair share of raising disciplinary boundaries.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
He was an undergrad at Caltech, where he did his degree in mathematics and physics.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
He was then a post-graduate student in Austin, Texas, where he worked in string theory and quantum gravity.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
And then he was a post-doc at Texas and then at Los Anamos before coming to the Santa Fe Institute.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
His interests include the emergence of life that he'll talk about today, but they're not restricted to the emergence of life.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
He's also interested in the correspondences between economic processes, physical processes, and living processes, biological ones,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
and also the connections between energy, information, and computation.

03:27.000 --> 03:36.000
So in tonight's lecture, Eric will ask whether, contrary I think to our intuitions, life might not be inevitable in the universe rather than rare.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Eric.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Thank you all for coming. David, thank you.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Wonderful introduction. It sets just exactly the right tone.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Because in a subject where there has been too much oversimplification and too much soundbite reporting,

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
I want to try to give you some sense of the richness and the beauty of the picture that comes up if we ask about the position of life on Earth.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
So let me stop this thing.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And...

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Good.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
So tonight I get to tell you some facts or some new ideas about the emergence of life on Earth

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
that I think will change what many of us have been told about whether we should think that life on Earth is surprising or inevitable

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
and how we should ask questions like this.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
At the same time as answering this question, it should change our understanding of the position of the biosphere within the geological world

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
and several important aspects of our position as people or as animals within the biosphere.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
So there are many different messages that all sort of inform each other.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
I want to set us tonight the task of answering four questions.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
First one, why is there life on Earth at all as opposed to nothing or as opposed to an empty rocky planet?

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
How and where did it originate? Sort of obvious questions of mechanism.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Why has life persisted?

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
This is important because I think if we have a sensible understanding of how life emerged,

05:09.000 --> 05:17.000
that must also make it sensible that life has stayed because the things that cause it to persist are the same things that caused it to emerge in the first place.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
So the questions must be asked and answered sensibly together.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
And then, last of all, does the biosphere contain relics of emergence so that by looking at what life is today,

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
we have a window that's informative about how it came into existence?

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Now, before I can address any of these sort of forward-looking questions,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I have to address a question that has been a problem in this topic,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
which is whether science can say anything about these problems at all.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And of course, since I'm here on behalf of the Institute talking to you about science,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
you would think that this is a foregone answer,

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
but if we poll some influential 20th century scientists and particular biologists,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
the returns we get are a little bit surprising.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
So let me start with Stephen Jay Gould.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
I actually chose my talk title tonight as a response to Gould's very wonderful little book called Wonderful Life.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
Many of you will probably have read it, and it had a big influence on me with my first exposures to biology,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
and it's a really important work of this century.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Gould chose the title for his book on the basis of Frank Capra's 1946 movie, It's a Wonderful Life,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
because he felt that the movie told exactly the story he wanted to tell.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
It's a story that an individual's actions can have permanent and important consequences.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
And Gould's message about biology was that for the first time in science,

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
things that seem to be accidental can have consequences that could last forever.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
So, of course, being Gould and fighting the last war against oversimplification,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
he states things in the strongest possible terms.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Any replay of the tape would lead evolution down a pathway radically different from the road actually taken.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Now, if you take this at face value or in the context of the book,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
it makes it sound like accidents are all that matters,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
which kind of leaves us wondering what then is the role for science,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
not the same as in the other sciences maybe.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Gould, of course, worked with things that are big enough to see without a microscope and it can leave fossils.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Let's go to somebody who works with things that are smaller.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
This is Jacques Monot, who, the year I was born in 1965,

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
won a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his work on the regulation of cell machinery from the gene.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Monot wrote a lasting influential book called Chance and Necessity.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
His concern was one that we've heard many times,

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
a wish that people not imprint human notions of purpose on biological descriptions of how machinery works.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
And he was interested in arguing against two things in particular.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
The two ways people tend to imprint purpose.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
One, vitalism would have been a claim that when matter becomes part of a living thing,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
it's no longer the same as other matter and we can't understand it.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
The other, animism, which says, well, it's all matter, but it all has purpose from the beginning.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
I think Monot's point in arguing this was to try to bring biology closer together to the other sciences

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
and the way they're understood.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
But, of course, Monot was primarily a guy who explains how machinery works

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
and how machinery works doesn't necessarily provide a good explanation of why it's there at all or how it got there.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
And so, faced with this difficulty, he makes a statement that if anything is even stronger than Gould's.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
He says, the biosphere does not contain a predictable class of objects or of events,

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
but constitutes a particular occurrence, compatible indeed with first principles,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
but not dedusible from those principles and essentially unpredictable.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
So he starts out trying to bring biology together with the other sciences

08:48.000 --> 08:56.000
and with this sort of encapsulating statement, if anything, it makes biology seem even more remote from the other sciences

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
and leaves us wondering what can we say.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
But the granddaddy of them all, as far as strong statements, is Francis Crick.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Crick, together with Jim Watson, discovered the double helix structure of DNA

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
and first realized that this was the molecule that could be responsible for heredity in the way it works.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
And Crick takes this sort of accidentalist viewpoint of Gould and Monot

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
all the way back to the beginning by associating the emergence of life

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
with the emergence of something like DNA and heredity.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
So early, you see him here, he's looking sort of appropriately like a sorcerer,

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
presumably lecturing on the structure of the molecule that's the key to life itself.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And I think a lot of people have tried to think of DNA in those terms

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
and I'm going to try to push back a little against that tonight.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
But he refers to the emergence of life as a happy accident

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
and a little bit later goes on to say, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
So many are the conditions which would have to have been satisfied to get it going.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
Now, if there's one thing we know science does not claim to be able to talk about, it's miracles,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
so while this is not necessarily a logical impossibility,

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
it seems like a very strange point of view for a scientist to be putting forward as a scientific conclusion

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
because it amounts essentially to throwing up one's hands and saying,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
oh, we can't say anything about that part.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
So if there is ambiguity in the public's understanding of what science has to say about the emergence of life,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I think it would not be blamed on the public.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Maybe we should start by looking at the things scientists have said.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
But if there's ambiguity, it should be leading us to ask three important questions.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
As one of my favorite political commentators says, what were they thinking?

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Specifically, what aspect of biology are these people looking at

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
that would cause them to draw such seemingly odd conclusions?

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
For us, what's important is, is this really science?

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Is this the nature of life that they're talking about,

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
or is it actually a nature of their point of view which might be narrow and might have left things out?

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Because if it is just a prejudice that comes from not having looked at everything

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
and we can broaden our perspective a little bit,

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
maybe we can find that from a bigger perspective there's a story that's not all about accident

11:15.000 --> 11:21.000
and that's truer to the nature of life, not necessarily to the history of science.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
So that's what the rest of tonight is supposed to be about.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So what were they thinking?

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Most of us who have seen anything about the history of life

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
have seen a picture something like this.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We see many pictures of trees of life.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
Let me very briefly tell you what this is in case it's not familiar.

11:38.000 --> 11:44.000
Every name here at the end, elegant things like methanosarsina and entoamibi,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
these are big groups of organisms.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
The tree is basically much too small for me to be able to show individual organisms.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
And as we go down any of these lines,

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
what you're seeing is the history that led up to the organism as it is today.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
So when you see then two lines that become one line in the past,

12:03.000 --> 12:10.000
the idea is that two things that are today different once had an ancestor that was a single thing.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
So one could easily talk for days about just this tree.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
There's so much interesting to know about it.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I'll mention only a few things.

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
One, this is a representation of data that says that everything we know about in the earth is related to everything else.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
And as far as we can tell, everything that's around today came at some point from one single form

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
that was a bottleneck from which the survivors descended.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Now, to give you a sense of scale, everything that you can see without a microscope

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
is these three little branches here, the plants, animals, and the fungi.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
So the rest of what is alive in the world is individual cells.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
Now, I couldn't make this dot small enough to only cover all of human history,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
so it's about ten times too big for that.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
And it's kind of a useful thing to give us a sense of what part people are in the natural world.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
And not only scientifically, but also as human beings.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
But the thing that I really want to point out to you about trees that's important is

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
that the only time similarities, and that's what these trees are, I should mention,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
the trees are trees of family resemblances.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
You see a trait that's into things and not anywhere else.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
You infer that those two things, that the trait came from a time when those two things were once a single population of organisms.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
Now, the only way having the same trait implies that you're related to the others that have the trait

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
is if that is infinitely accidental.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
So this is the reason you can't use skin darkness to figure out who's related to whom.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Because as soon as you move toward the equator, you have to get darker to survive.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
You move away from the equator, you have to get lighter to survive.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
So these things can change so fast, and they can change in so many ways

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
that they're not good guides to what is related to what.

13:54.000 --> 14:02.000
So the only time family resemblances imply a tree is when the change along these branches

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
is in characters that are so rare that it's amazing they ever occurred,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
and if they're lost, they're gone forever.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.000
So the reason Gould sees accident is that Gould's life was understanding the structure and the relations of this tree,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
which is a thing that emphasizes the accidental parts of life.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
But we still have to understand why anything about life is so accidental

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
that it would make a tree, that the family relations would be that.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
And to understand that, we have to go down to the molecular level.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
So this is now the world of Cric and Mono.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
What Cric discovered with the double helix structure of DNA

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
was that you have a positive and a negative of the same information,

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
which can be split and copied without being used up,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
and that's how changes can be passed on from a mother to a daughter

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
when in the case of cells the mother divides.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Now at the same time, either the positive or the negative can be used

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
as a source of instructions to control the cell,

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
and that's how the hereditary information that's passed down is expressed in us.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
But the thing that's important here is this is like a company

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
whose commander only gives commands and never listens to feedback.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
The only way you know whether they were good ideas or not

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
is whether the company lives or dies.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
This is what implies accident because it says that it's only the accidental changes

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
in the course of living or in the course of dividing

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
that cause organisms to gradually change,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
and then those changes are inherited,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
and the only thing that determines what we see today

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
is which changes lived and which ones didn't.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
This is Darwin's idea,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
and of course what Cric and Watson recognized

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
is that this is the molecular basis

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
that gives substance to Darwin's empirical observations.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But I'll point out to you here,

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
this is the description of life at the level of control and inheritance.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
Of course, if we have a moment of common sense,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
we remember that there's more to life than control.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
What I want to do is now broaden the picture,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
ask what else is in life,

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
and then start to dig down in a different area that maybe is more fruitful.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
What I want to show you here,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
life is not just one thing.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
It's not just one level of structure or just one kind of organization.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
It's many things and they're all different and they all work together.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Just to give you a lay of the land,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I'll review what some of them are,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
and then I'll tell you which ones I want to focus on.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
First thing, life lives in the non-living world of rocks in the atmosphere.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
In the non-living world, your carbon comes in the form of carbon dioxide molecules mostly.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
That's what these little stunted butterflies are supposed to be,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
pictures of carbon dioxide.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
The first thing life has to do is make carbon-carbon bonds,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
which it does by making a certain set of small molecules.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
There are many of these about 250 and they're not very big,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
between 5 and 20 carbon atoms.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
This is a whole structure of chemistry that's called core metabolism,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and that'll be the hero of our story tonight.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
But for a moment, let me go on.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
You make little atoms one carbon at a time.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
When you make big atoms, you do something different.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
You stitch the little atoms together like beads on a necklace.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
This is where you get the big molecules, the DNA and the proteins,

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
that can have tens or hundreds of thousands of atoms, in some cases even millions.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Of course, that's not all.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
The big molecules have to be physically stuck together to make the structures of cells.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
That's a different organizational problem.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Now, for some living things, that's as far as it goes,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
your one cell and that's your life.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
For others, you get many cells that group together to make a plant or an animal.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
That's another problem of organization.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
For most of us, we live in an ecosystem where we have relations to all the other organisms.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
That's another problem of coordination and organization.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
The ecosystems together on the earth feedback and change its basic geological chemistry.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
All this is going on, these things are very different in their dynamics.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
We shouldn't be thinking that one idea of control explains all of them.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
The remarkable thing is, if we look at these things from the perspective of chance and necessity,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
we find that in fact they lay at very different places.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
The benchmark for what I'll call necessity is the chemistry of the rocks and the atmosphere and the oceans.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
On any planet like the earth, it's going to be the same.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
There's not much that's accidental to it.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
It's very steady, we can predict what the minerals are and we understand it with our science.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
At the opposite end of this is any individual species.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
The fact that there should happen to have been a large flightless pigeon on Mauritius is an infinite accident.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
The fact that it didn't survive unfortunately is the most likely thing.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
This is Gould's world of contingency.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
All the things that almost never were and never will be again.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Here, of course, they're variable.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
They fluctuate like crazy.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
This is Doug Irwin's lecture a few months ago on extinctions.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
We have a hard time predicting them.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
This is Gould, Mono, and Crick, their statements.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Here's what's neat.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Biology is not all piled up against the contingent end.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
If I ask about the small molecules here,

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
these are almost as steady as the chemistry of the rocks.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
The same set of about 250 of them is in every living thing in the world

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
and appears to have been the same for all of history, almost four billion years.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
So it's like a feature of the geosphere.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
DNA, well, chemically DNA has been around probably since fairly close to the beginning

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
and RNA even closer than that.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
But when this contains instructions for how to make these chemicals,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
the instructions can change all over the place.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
The chemicals do not change and the pathways do not change.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
So all of a sudden control is looking like maybe it's not the most important thing.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Maybe getting the answer is the important thing

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
and you have some freedom in how you do it with control.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Cells are fairly regular,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
but there's a significant amount of variability in them over history.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
And ecosystems, if I could have drawn them, should cover this entire span

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
because the accidents of how we live together in an ecosystem

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
are among the most fragile things that are parts of life.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
And yet the chemistry of ecosystems, which is the chemistry of these molecules,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
goes all the way back here to the oldest things we know.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
So in fact, if we want to understand the predictable parts of life,

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
we should be looking at metabolism as the bridge between the rock chemistry

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
and the early stages of life and the part that we can predict.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
But in order to do that, we need a science of metabolism

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
which is going to be different from the science of control.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
So let me start back looking at the things that are alive again

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
and show you how you would think about their organisation in metabolic terms.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
Turns out two questions will answer a huge fraction of what you need to know.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
One is where you get your energy,

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
and the second is do you depend on other living things for your own survival?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
And there are two choices to each.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
So biochemistry 101 in 30 seconds.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
All of life is driven by energetic electrons

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
and the only question about where you get your energy is where you get your electrons.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
There turn out to be two choices.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
There are molecules that release energy by giving electrons away

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
and the metabolisms that run on that energy are what I call reductive here.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And both of these are of that kind.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And I'll tell you what they are in a minute.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
This little guy lives at almost the temperature of boiling water in volcanoes under the deep sea.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
This is botulism, which when I was a kid was not a cosmetic,

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
it was a deadly poison that you tried not to get in your canned goods.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
The other option besides reductive metabolisms are oxidative metabolisms

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
where the energy comes from pulling electrons to the environment.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Oxidative metabolisms are things like the blue-green algae that give the ocean its greenish colour

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
and everything most people think about life is down in this corner.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
The animals, the plants, the fungi, everything big enough to see without a microscope.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Now here's the interesting thing.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
The oxygen in the world that is the foundation for this way of life was produced by living things.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It was not always here.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
So this whole way of life didn't exist at the beginning of the world

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
and didn't exist at significant complexity until quite late,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
probably half of the age of the earth.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
Now the other distinction we can make is whether or not you need anything else in the world.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
There are organisms, both of these kinds,

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
which basically can do every chemical thing they need in a world with no other living thing.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
What a life it must be, especially if you're just one cell,

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
you know, no communication, no competition,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
but they can do what none of the rest of us can do.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
These guys are called autotrophs from the Greek roots meaning self-feeding.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
The alternative to being an autotroph is to be a heterotroph.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
You have to live in an ecology because your own chemistry is incomplete

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
and you have to have the ecology providing things for you.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
And we, of course, are the ultimate heterotrophs.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
We need everything.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
But in fact, what I did here was a little bit of a sleight of hand.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I did the thing people always do.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
I looked at individual species and individual organisms.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
That wasn't the right thing to do.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It turns out to be a distraction.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Because if I look at the ecosystem level,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
the whole ecology together, things become even simpler.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
By definition, every ecology, because it's self-contained,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
has to do all of its own chemistry.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So every ecology is autotrophic.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
The remarkable thing that you get from studying biochemistry

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
is the knowledge that other than this division,

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
there's essentially no variability at the ecosystem level

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
in the chemistry of life, which means that...

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I mean, this is the Tolstoy quote.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
All autotrophic ecosystems are essentially alike,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
but every heterotrophic organism is heterotrophic in its own way.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
If you are a reductive ecology, like one of these sulfur swamps

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
that you get in volcanic hot springs,

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
then you're living off of electrons that come from the geochemical reactions.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
If you're an oxidative ecology, there's a little bit more variability.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
You're living ultimately off of energy that comes from sunlight

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and the ability to produce oxygen.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
But here's the more remarkable thing.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Chemically, these things look like opposites.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Either the environment gives you electrons where it pulls them in.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
It turns out that in the structure of life,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
this is not just an opposition, it's a hierarchy.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
Because the universal chemistry that is in these guys

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
is a subset of what's in these guys.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Oxidative life is reductive life wrapped up in a spacesuit

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
that's able to capture sunlight.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
So what that means is that even though on the earth today

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
there are environments with almost no oxygen

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
down in the deep seas around volcanoes

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
and environments with locks of oxygen,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
like up here where we live,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
you can also look at this as a picture back in time.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Because back at the very beginning,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
when there was not yet life to have made oxygen,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
the only kind of life there was was the reductive life.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
And in these very simple organisms,

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
basically building biomass is enough to be alive.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
This may have happened as long as almost four billion years ago

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
within a couple hundred million years

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
of when the ocean stopped boiling off.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
So it basically was a snap of a finger.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It happened as quickly as it could.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Probably somewhat later,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
and this is the biggest uncertainty in the talk,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
when this happened is unknown to a billion years or more.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
But at some point organisms started to realize

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
that there was huge energy in sunlight if they could capture it.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
And they started to couple that to building their core metabolism,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and they started producing oxygen.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Took a long time though for the oxygen to build up

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
and only when there was a lot did you start getting the things

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
we think about as life, complex cell forms,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
multi-cell organisms, all that stuff.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Now here's the striking thing.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Oxygen, when it first was introduced, was a waste product.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
It was a worst poison for life

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
than anything any of us has ever imagined.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And yet this chemistry did not end.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
It was preserved and it has been preserved all the way up to the present.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
So.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I've just thrown a huge amount of stuff at you in five slides.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
I think maybe that's appropriate because life is complicated.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
And we said that if we want to avoid the mistakes of the past,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
we don't want to oversimplify by ignoring things at the beginning.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
We want to look at it all,

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
and then we want to see what looks like it doesn't depend on chance,

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
and we want to let universality and stability be our guide.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
So we've been able to boil the story down

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
to focusing on the core molecules of biochemistry

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
and what we use to build our own biomass.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
So at this point, we're still in the middle of a treasure hunt.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
We think we know what we're after, but there hasn't been an aha.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
That's for the next slide.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
But here's the cool thing.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
If you were to watch a movie,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
and one of the characters were to open up a treasure map

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
that has five arrows pointing to someplace saying,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
here it is, this is it,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
you would say, okay, that's not a very subtle movie.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
What kind of a character needs that?

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
What I'm about to show you is that the map of biochemistry

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
is a treasure map with five arrows pointing to here it is,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
and it's been known since the 1960s.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
But people only started to recognize what they were seeing

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
within about the last 25 years.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
So this is what is universal about the way we build all of our biomolecules.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Biochemistry itself is not super complicated.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
If you ask what we are made of, we're made of five classes of things,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
and we know all of them because we have to eat them.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Because you remember I said we're metabolically incomplete.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
So we need the fatty acids because otherwise we can't make cells.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
That's your olive oil.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
We need the amino acids, which we know from meringue and marshmallow

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
and things like that.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
That's the structure and the enzymes and all that good stuff.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
We need sugars.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Turns out they're probably more important for structure

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
than they are for energy storage, but we like them for the other thing.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Very, very important set of about 20 to 30 little molecules

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
which do all of our sort of super fine chemistry.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Like the chlorophyll that allows plants to capture sunlight

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
or the heme that allows us to do respiration.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
And then of course there are the nucleic acids, the molecules of heredity.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Now there are 250 or 300 basic molecules that these are built up from.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
But here is the kicker.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
Every molecule in every living thing in all the world for all time

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
has been synthesized from one of these 11 molecules in this cycle.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
Now when we were in high school a lot of us were taught about the Krebs cycle.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
And of course there was the million dollar, billion dollar point here

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
which was ignored and something of almost no importance that we were told.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
We were told that the Krebs cycle is important because we use it to break down sugars to get energy.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
The Krebs cycle is important because everything in the entire history of life

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
has used it as the starting point to build every biomolecule.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
No exceptions.

28:55.000 --> 29:00.000
We came along 2.5 billion, well single cells came along 2.5 billion years later

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
and used it to get energy.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
But we're borrowers in that sense.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
So it may be obvious now that I think this is where life started

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
but now that we have this chemical framework I can also tell you why

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
I think life had to start this way.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
Which is a question that we can ask in chemistry in a way that we could not before.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
So in biology the struggle has always been when you think in terms of control

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
how do you explain why something is there?

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Because when we think why is something there we always think what is it good for?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Well what is it good for is a purpose based question

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
and it's not clear that it came up because it was good for anything.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It came up for a different reason.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
In chemistry we're not so susceptible to that error

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
because in chemistry we're used to saying what was it getting away from?

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
So a new way to ask about why life emerged is to say what was wrong with a non-living earth?

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
What was so wrong that could have driven it to have to change

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
and why was that change in the direction that led toward life?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
And that's the thing that I think we can answer

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
or that we can at least pose good questions to that are testable in the laboratory.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
So that's what I'll tell you about in what's left.

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
Turns out what we appeal to for understanding is the thing that's the most familiar of all.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
If you put enough stress on something it will break.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
And it turns out that the essential math and also the essential intuition I care about

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
for the origin of life is the intuition of breakdown.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
Now the thing that might be non or sort of counterintuitive

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
if you've been wondering about the origin of life

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
you don't normally think of the origin of life as the breaking of a lifeless earth.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
So the two things that I have to show you is there's more than one way for things to break down

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
and then second sometimes the process of breakdown is a process of creating new structure

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
and creating accident where there was only formlessness before.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
But you'll be surprised as familiar as crack propagation is to us

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
these other two facts about breakdown are equally familiar.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
One of them we know all the time

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
because lightning of course is a breakdown of the atmosphere.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
It's not a mechanical breakdown but instead it's an electrical breakdown.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
The thing that we need if we want to understand why life emerged

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
is to understand where the stress came from

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
and why it results in one kind of breakdown instead of another.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
So if you want to understand lightning you say

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
that storm systems pull charges apart between the clouds and the ground

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
and that creates an electrical stress for the charges to try to recombine.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
The ordinary dry atmosphere which is the preferred configuration

31:44.000 --> 31:50.000
can't do that transport but the creation of the plasma channel of the lightning bolt

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
can do that transport and that's what sustains the plasma channel.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
Now we can't predict exactly the track it will take, that's contingent, that's accidental

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
but we can very well predict the chemistry of this plasma channel.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
So the analogy here and it's better than an analogy, it's a scientific equivalence

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
is that our biochemistry is like the altered state that is the plasma channel

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
within the lightning bolt and it was driven into existence in something like the same way.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
Now lightning is not an ideal example here because it's gone in a short time

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
and we don't think of it as lasting for very long

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
even though on the scale of the processes that make it it's plenty long lived.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
But there are other examples.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Hurricanes are another kind of a breakdown of the atmosphere.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
This is not a breakdown of the electrical structure of the atmosphere,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
it's a breakdown of the thermal structure.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
What I'm showing you here is a set of hurricane tracks

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
which you can see transporting heat out of the tropical oceans

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
and into the temperate and polar upper atmospheres.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
This is what drives the hurricane system as of course people now understand

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
and appreciate in a way that they did in a little while back.

32:57.000 --> 33:03.000
This is a channel that has the ability to pull in heat

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
in order to reinforce its own structure

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
and the wall storms of the hurricane are transporting that heat from the ocean to the upper atmosphere.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.000
But in order to do that they have to break the smooth layered structure

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
that the atmospheric temperature usually has.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
So if we want to understand the emergence of life, was it a chemical breakdown,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
what we have to ask is where did that happen

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
and what was the stress that would have caused it to happen.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
And now we're talking about stress in a chemical sense.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
So my good friend and colleague Harold Morowitz,

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
who is much older than I, also has an infinite gift for words.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
And he has recognized, that's why he's written something like eight or nine books

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
that are revered around the world and I recommend any of them to you.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
But he's recognized that theories of the origin of life can be divided into two categories.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
There are the heaven theories and the hell theories.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
You can already guess which one I'll like.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
But it turns out that this has a basis.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
They're distinguished according to where the energy comes from

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
in the life forms that use it today.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
The heaven theories are all of the theories

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
whose energy ultimately comes from sunlight or starlight.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
The idea is that there's so much energy in this

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
that it can do the chemistry of forming carbon-carbon bonds.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
So it can produce the small molecules.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
This can happen on the surfaces of asteroids, which then fall on the earth.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It can happen in the ices of comets.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
In some small amount, the sunlight drives the weather system

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
and a little bit of the energy from weather winds up in the lightning bolt

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
and that can do a little bit of chemistry.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
This was what the Miller-Urey experiment showed

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
that was so exciting to people

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
and that got the origin of life started as a scientific question.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
And all of these stories that have to do with this sort of sunlight-yielded chemistry

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
are the things that we associate with the primordial soup.

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
Now, this appealed to people when there was no other idea in town,

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
but there are a lot of problems with it.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Sunlight is a tremendous energy source,

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
but it's not easy to use because it tends to destroy things.

35:07.000 --> 35:13.000
And so, in fact, it's much easier to understand the way sunlight is used today

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
if that happens somewhat later on when there was already life in place

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
with the complexity to capture it.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
Another problem with the primordial soup is that you need to finish life

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
before the soup is done, so you're on the clock.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
The idea is that, in the classical scenarios,

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
heaven deposits organic materials on the surface of the ocean

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
and accidental chemistry gives you a control mechanism

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
and then you have the keys to life itself, the DNA or whatever,

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
but then you have to build the whole life underneath of this

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
before you have used all of the soup.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
So, that's unappealing.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
The thing that, to me, is the biggest problem with these ideas

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
is that, in this chemistry,

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
there's no special place for the biochemistry we see,

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
and there's no special reason to exclude all of the things

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
that are not in our biochemistry.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
So, it's not clear to me that this is very tightly coupled to who we are.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
And since the whole point of exploring biochemistry

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
was that that was the thing to be explained,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I think we should expect a coupling.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
And that's where the hell theory comes in.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
This is the theory, particularly associated with hydrothermal vents.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
These can be volcanoes, but they can be quieter things

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
that involve magma and water under the deep ocean.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
There can be many different kinds.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
You can have these guys which are alkaline

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
and which are full of carbon dioxide, but not too much metal.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
These are called white smokers,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
and they occur in not the hottest places.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
These are about at the boiling temperature of water a little bit cooler.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
These guys can be 600 degrees Fahrenheit

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
or 300 degrees Celsius, roughly,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and they thunder along at the bottom of the ocean.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
They're black because they're full of metal and sulfur.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
They're full of carbon dioxide. They're full of hydrogen.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
In particular, they're full of all of the chemicals

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
that life needs to exist,

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
but they are not full of primordial soup.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
And oddly enough, that turns out to be an advantage.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
And I'll show you why in the next slide.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Oh, I should mention to you

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
that there are whole ecosystems that live down here.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
The little grey guy that I told you can live all by itself

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
with no other living thing.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
They live down here in this range,

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
and they do exactly the chemistry I'm going to tell you

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
I think was being done four billion years ago

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
before there was life.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
If you want to understand what was wrong with a lifeless earth,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
then you say what was the problem.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Here's the problem.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
The geochemistry creates carbon dioxide,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and it creates hydrogen.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Now, hydrogen has electrons

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
that it can give to carbon or oxygen,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and if it were to give them,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
so you put as many hydrogens as will fit around a carbon

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
to make methane,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
you put as many hydrogens as will fit around an oxygen

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
to make water,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
that is the most energy that's available from this system.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
You look at this picture and you say,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
well, how hard could it be?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Well, it turns out it's very hard.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
It's harder than any non-living thing

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
can do at an appreciable rate,

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
but living things do it with superb efficiency.

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
So what life on earth is today doing,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
among other things,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
these geochemical processes

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
are generating all this energetic stuff,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
but it would build up and build up and build up

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
in the absence of life.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Life consumes it, provides this downhill run

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
to lower energy molecules.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
So the idea behind the lightning strike

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
is that this stress, when there was no life,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
built up and built up

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
and created a lightning strike through chemistry

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
to make this possible.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
But what does that have to do with biochemistry?

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
All I showed you was carbon dioxide and methane.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Here's a surprising thing that's a little different

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
than we're used to thinking of.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I told you that there are organisms that live

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
in these hydrogen environments,

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
the reducing environments that give electrons.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
They're doing this chemistry

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
and they have essentially nothing more than biosynthesis.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Their energy capture is very limited.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
It's much less than a tenth of what any of us

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
use up in the air-breathing world.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
The surprising thing is that in order to get from here to here,

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
the best way is to go through the molecules of life.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So what this picture is, you can think of this

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
as being the chemical equivalent of a ball rolling down a hill

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
and it has the same mathematical meaning.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
What I'm showing you here is the starting point

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
when no chemistry has been done,

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
the ending point when all of the energy has been extracted,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
and across here is how far you've gone

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
in transferring those hydrogens.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
It turns out that there are no ways through little molecules

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
to go from here to here that are as energy efficient and simple

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
as going through these molecules,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
which are the ones in the cycle I showed you.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
You don't need to worry about the names,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
but if you want to know why is there sugar,

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
there's sugar because sugar is downhill from the stuff that makes sugar.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
If you want to understand why there's oil, including petroleum,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
it's because oil is on the way to methane

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
if you have enough hydrogen to make it.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
And so what I'm telling you, the chemistry was doing here,

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
is exactly what these little guys are doing

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
at the base of that hydrothermal vent that I showed you.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Incidentally, if I had remembered to point it out on the tree,

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
you remember that some of the organisms seem to connect in

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
very, very close to the root.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
Unlike us, we're kind of connected way out here in the leaves.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
This is one of them.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
This connects all the way down at the bottom.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Lives a few degrees below the boiling temperature of water.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Seems to have ancestors that could be at least 3 billion years old

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
before it has a common ancestry with anything else.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
Does this simple chemistry is completely self-contained

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and does nothing else?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
So this is the kind of model we're looking at

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
for the chemistry of the origin of life.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Now, you shouldn't believe me yet,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
even if you might believe me in a minute,

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
because I just told you that all of this chemistry is hard.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
So where did any of this stuff come from if it's so hard to do?

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
And that's what's special about the cycle at the core of biochemistry

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
with all the arrows pointing to it.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Because that cycle is the chemical equivalent of the hurricane.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
So here's the cycle again.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I didn't know how to show it to you

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
without making it sort of sleep inducing.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
But this is actually the chemical diagram

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
showing where carbon dioxide's come in,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
where hydrogen's come in, where waters are given off,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and so on, and we go round and round the cycle.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And we go around it in this picture the same way

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
as the hurricane goes around it.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
By the way, if you have kids in school

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
and they come home telling you that the Krebs cycle

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
is the citric acid cycle,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
tell them, wait till they grow up.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Because this thing is called by some people

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
the reverse citric acid cycle.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
This is the real citric acid cycle.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
This was here 4 billion years ago.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
We run the reverse citric acid cycle.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
That came along only when there was oxygen much later.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
But the important thing about this cycle is this.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
The chemistry of these molecules

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
is chemistry that's like flypaper.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
It's suited to take in a carbon dioxide or a hydrogen

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
even if they couldn't react with each other.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
And so as you go around the cycle,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
the molecules get bigger and bigger

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and bigger as they take in carbon.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
And then when they get here, they split.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
And you get two molecules where before you had one.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
So now you can take in twice as much carbon.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
And it splits again.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
And now you can take in four times as much carbon.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
So this is like compound interest.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Or like the chain reaction that was, of course,

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
made famous by Los Alamos some decades ago.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Or the hair commercial where she told two people

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
and so on and so on.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
The thing that's important about these kinds of cycles is

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
that even if you have only a very rare event

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
to form one of these molecules,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
if you have self-amplification,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that can cause all of your carbon

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
and all of your energy flow

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
to get sucked into one cycle.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Just like you never find two hurricanes

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
in exactly the same place,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
because any one of them is pulling all of the local energy in

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
from the ocean where it is.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
So that's pretty much the story.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I'm not going to tell you that all of it is fact,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
that all of it's established,

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
but all of it is experimentally testable.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
And there are several things that I think it allows us to think

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
that are different than have been thought before,

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
probably more common sense and maybe more useful.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Metabolism first, not control first.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Control is complicated if it had to come on a background of nothing

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
that would seem like almost a miracle,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
but it doesn't exist on a background of almost nothing today.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
It exists on a background of metabolism,

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
and metabolism is old.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
Life arose and persists in order to enable metabolism.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
This is the lightning strike argument.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Think about how different this is

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
than the way we usually think.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
We usually think that metabolism exists in order to enable life.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
That's the sort of purpose-oriented thinking.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
In the chemical domain,

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
you get a completely different idea of what life even is.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Life is what can be built out of those 11 molecules

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
when you have this amplifying cycle

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
spewing them out from geochemistry.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
We get, to me, the very pleasing idea

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
that the emergence of life was a form of collapse.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
The important thing about this is

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
that things do not come up off of the floor

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
and rearrange themselves on the table.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
So if the transition from a non-living to a living earth

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
was actually a collapse,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
that enables us to understand why life has been so stable.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
Species go extinct, ecosystems rearrange.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Life has never winked out.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
It's been continuous all the way back,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and the chemistry has been invariant.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
This is a sensible way to look at that.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Of course, most of all,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
the biosphere is no longer separate from the geosphere,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
not in our thinking, not in our science.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Geochemistry is, in some sense,

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
the core of what we are and have always been.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
The rest of us as living things is built around it.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
There's contingency that comes in later.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
There's all kinds of room for accident,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
but this accident comes in

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
once there's a significant amount of structure already in place.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
Thank you, and it'll be good to talk.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
APPLAUSE

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
The first question is,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
why do we not find it spontaneously emerging

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
in the remote parts of the world?

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
If the absence of life in those remote parts of the world

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
is explained by competition with existing forms of life,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
which is the more common explanation,

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
then why is it so hard in a laboratory

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
and of highly idealised conditions to synthesise life?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Cool. Yeah, good. All good.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
So the answer to the first question

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
is a thing that even Darwin had already recognised,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
that in some sense,

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
when you have very modern forms that are very sophisticated,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
it's difficult for the things that gave rise to those modern forms

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
to be recreated.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
So for instance,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
I'm trying to think of something in the technological realm,

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
if there's some tremendous amount of effort

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
that's required to make the first digital computer,

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
and it's as big as this room and uses as much electricity as a city,

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
and then you have that thing sitting over there on the desk.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
People would not be willing to go through the same effort

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
to do the same difficult thing again,

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
once the efficient things are already there.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
So I should be careful.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
What you said the first time seems to be exactly right,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
that we have never found any place where the process

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
of the emergence of life is being repeated,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
but the second thing,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
we've never found any place in the earth

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
that doesn't have something living there.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
So you drill down as deep as you can in an oil well,

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
and you'll find bacteria and archaea living down there.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
You go up into arctic ices, they're there.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
Up in the atmosphere, they're up there feeding off dust particles.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
So in some sense, anywhere there's energy in the world,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
something is already grazing on it.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
And I think most people do not expect

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
any catastrophic surprises in that area.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
They think that we don't see the emergence of life again,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
because current life is so much more efficient.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
But then the question about the lab

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
really is pertinent to what we do.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
And so the interesting thing is that

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
not only is life complex, but the geological world is complex.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
And so here's the best thing we can do in the lab.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
There are probably three guys in the United States

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
who can do it, and I'm privileged to be sort of

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
on the doorstep of one of them asking for what he knows.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
You can take a fantastically expensive machine

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
that took you most of your career to build.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
You can put a little bit of chemistry into a gold capsule.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
You can seal it.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
You can compress it to 300 atmospheres

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
and heat it to 200 degrees.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
And then you can take it out and very carefully open it

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
and find out what happened.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
And if you don't have the chemistry exactly right,

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
you can start over.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
So compare that to what was happening in the early earth.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
In the early earth, the mantle was more fluid,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
and so there probably were no lasting continents.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It was constantly fractured.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
The moon was as big as a dinner plate in the sky,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
and the tides were once every six hours

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
and probably two kilometers high.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
The entire ocean probably got cycled

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
through these hydrothermal systems

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
on the order of once every 1,000 years,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
whereas today it's more like once every 100,000 years.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
And I told you that there were two of these systems today

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
that are sort of separate and sort of different

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
with their unrelated chemistry.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
One is alkaline, one is acid, one has low metals,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
one has high metals.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
In the early earth, the entire upper crust

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
was probably fractured with the ocean

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
infecting through it.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
And the chemistry at that time

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
could have been any mix of any of these things.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
So if we want to understand and recreate correctly

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
in the lab this organic chemistry,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
we have to understand what type of chemical environment

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
we're looking in.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
And that turns out to be a really hard search problem.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
Works better if you have the entire crust of the earth

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
than if you have a little gold capsule

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
that holds less than this much of my finger of a liquid.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
But I am hoping that I will live to see these experiments done.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I should tell you that for the citric acid,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
the Krebs cycle that I showed you,

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
George Cody and Carnegie Institution in Washington

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
has already gotten big arcs of this cycle to go

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
even with his little capsule.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
And so the question is whether at the places

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
where things are not working,

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
we're missing something about the mineral chemistry.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
And I think that that's probably the case

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and that it will probably be cracked.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
OK.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
So here's the next one.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
It's probably the question that is maybe of greatest interest

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
to the most people.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
And that is where does the inevitability end, right?

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
So in your spectrum, you know,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
it would be a sort of rather disappointing take-home message

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
of inevitable life was basically the inevitability

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
of a bunch of small molecules.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
And so the question is,

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
is there some possibility of identifying other regularities

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
and other processes that would make

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
more sophisticated, more complex structures inevitable too?

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
So, for example, you know, we watched Star Trek

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
and we encountered bipedal self-conscious extraterrestrials.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Are we going to be forever disappointed

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
and only ever encounter, you know, the Krebs cycle?

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Or is there something about the theory,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
or some theory that might be related to it,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
that would say that more complex structures

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
would be inevitable too?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Wonderful. Yep.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
So, of course, this is in some ways a disingenuous question

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
because this is what David and I work on together.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
And this is also what Jeffrey West at the Institute works on.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
We think there are all kinds of things that are very lawful

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
and that can only happen in more or less the way they do

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
at all kinds of structures throughout life.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I'll tell you about a couple in our work,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
but I'll tell you about a couple others that are obvious

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
that are just kind of common knowledge.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
All fish look more or less like fish,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
and that's because they live in water.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
It's out that if you look at diatoms,

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
these little tiny glass-encased things that are one or a few cells,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
they don't look like fish at all,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
but that's because they live at low Reynolds number.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
And if you're a fluid mechanic and you look at diatoms,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
they actually look all like each other,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
sort of like snowflakes look like each other.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
So, in some sense, there are rules that make fish fish

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
and that make diatoms diatoms.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Now, I didn't tell you much about what goes on at the chemistry

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
above this very basic cycle,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
but I think that we will be able to show

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
that maybe 14 or 15 of the 20 amino acids that we use

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
had to be either as they are or somewhere pretty close,

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
because it turns out that they are the easiest chemistry

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
to do from these carbon backbones.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
We think that a lot of the regularity that's in our genetic code

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
turns out to have had a chemical origin in the era

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
before there were cells, before there was any coding,

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
and that that probably is predictable.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
Of course, Geoffrey's work on allymetric scaling says,

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
if you want to become multicellular and you have to feed yourself,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
there are limits on how you can do that,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and that's why you do not have flying elephants

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
or little hummingbirds that live 100 years.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
And so there are lots of regularities,

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
and the lovely thing is, like the structures of life,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
they are not all alike.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
They're very different, and they each come at different scales,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
and yet once you stitch them all together,

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
a lot of times there's kind of a skeleton of regularity

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
and there's sense to the variations and the accidents

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
that can live around them.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
Those things and necessity are not things that are separated by a gulf.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
They're things that are constantly sort of interleaved.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
So is that?

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Good, yes.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
So why don't we take some questions now from the audience?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
There's one here, yes.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
Have any of the cornology that's been found in our explorations

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
of the moon and Mars?

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
No.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
We haven't looked for them in Mars,

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
but here's a point that maybe I could have made better in the talk.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
When I say that we are coupled to the geosphere,

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
we really are coupled to the energy of the geosphere,

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
because having carbon and having nitrogen or oxygen or phosphorus or sulphur

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
is not enough to give you life.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
You have to have an energy source that forces it to exist,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
and the moon is a very low energy place,

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
and today even Mars is a very low energy place.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
The moons of Jupiter are not low energy places.

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
They may be chemically different places from the earth,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
but it's kind of like Alice in Wonderland.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
It takes all the running you can do just to stay in place.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
You'll have to run a lot harder than that to get anywhere.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
It's taken all we can do to understand the chemistry that's in the life we know.

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
If the chemistry of the planet or the moon is different on Europa or on Titan,

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
it may turn out to be an equally hard problem where we don't have clues

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
to understand what we should look for there.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
But if you can find me a planet whose rocks are like the earth,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
and it comes from a second-generation star,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
it's about at the same distance,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I will certainly go there looking for vinegar,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
and looking for malic acid and citric acid,

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
and all these other good things that are even familiar.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
They're so common.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Yeah, there's a question back there.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
You may have answered this in his second question,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
but in your tree of life,

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
everything went down in this root of the tree.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
It's my understanding, and I'm not in this field,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
that even in that trunk of the tree,

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
biologists presume that there's DNA, there's control,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
even in our trunk.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
So it must have happened very early,

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
as what you're saying, not as early as this,

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
but is DNA still in other places?

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
If we do find the predacypal on another planet,

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
are we going to find DNA on that planet?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I don't know about DNA.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
I would bet more than 50 cents on RNA.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Depending on how many trillion dollars it costs us to go there,

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
then there's a question how much you would bet on RNA.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
You have it exactly right,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
and you raise two really important points,

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
because the oldest thing you can trace with a family tree

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
is a thing that has a structure of control.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
So anything that happens before the structure of control,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
even if it had a long time to happen,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
the family tree will not enable you to know about,

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
because there was nothing to preserve those family resemblances.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Now, interesting thing,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
DNA is really good for what it does,

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
and RNA is not so good for the things DNA does,

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
and there's a lot of chemical sense in DNA.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
And it's interesting, it turns out that the sugar in DNA

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
is not very hard for an organic chemist to make

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
from some of the chemicals that I showed you there,

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
but that's not the way it's made in any living thing.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
In every living thing, it's made from the sugar in RNA

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
via a much more complicated, difficult reaction.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
I think what that tells us is that RNA was certainly there,

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
whether it was there a little before,

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
or a little after there were cells,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
is a hard problem to be worked out,

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
and I would believe either one of those with a good argument.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
DNA may have come, interesting possibility,

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
on the tree DNA could have come after the first branching.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
There are some people who believe it did,

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
because the molecules that make, that copy DNA,

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
look to have been independently derived twice.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So it could be that, at the root,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
there was actually an RNA organism,

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
and DNA was discovered for its value twice.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
There's a question here.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Yeah.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
My main recollection of the prep cycle

56:14.000 --> 56:24.000
is that there are quite a few enzymes that they can go.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
What about that?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
That's the other wonderful part of the story

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
that, if I had been a chemist, I would have told you

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
instead of the story I told you today.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
The enzymes in modern cells are so efficient.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
They can increase the rate of reaction by millions,

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
or as much as hundreds of millions of times.

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
Now, there also tends to hundreds of thousands of atoms long,

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
so they probably didn't exist.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Because they're so good, and it's been so much work

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
to understand how they work,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
almost all of our focus on catalysis

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
has focused on these very big, very sophisticated,

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
and relatively late molecules.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
A thing that is now being discovered,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
but needs to be much more explored,

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
is that small molecules can also be catalysts.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
They're not nearly as good,

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
but they're also not nearly as hard to make.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And not only small molecules can be catalysts,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
but mineral surfaces can be catalysts.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
The people who know this better than anybody

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
are the petroleum engineers,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
because they're the ones who use it to convert the grades

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
of gasoline and diesel and all that stuff.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
And this is another place where there are tremendous fossils.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
Much of the mineral chemistry that's good for hydrocracking

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
involves iron, sulfur, cobalt, and molybdenum,

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
some part of that is preserved in the enzymes

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
as the actual active site that either moves an electron

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
or moves a functional group.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And so, if we want to understand where the structure

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
to the chemistry came from and we need catalysis,

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
the place we need to look is in the small molecules themselves.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Starting with the minerals,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
what can be done on the surfaces of exposed rock,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
when those make small molecules,

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
what catalytic capabilities do those perform?

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
A few experiments have been done

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
with showing that every one of the amino acids

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
is catalytic for certain reactions that will make sugar.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
And they're specific.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
They not only enhance the rates,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
but they do it in different ways for different molecules.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
So this is a whole field of organic chemistry

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
that doesn't yet exist,

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
just because people haven't put a priority onto doing it.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
But I hope that that's a thing

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
that within a small number of years

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
will become an active area of work.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
There's a question behind you.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
That, yes, you know.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
A great volume of something up on the internet

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
of a supplementary researcher,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
he said, was playing that

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
beings aren't dying in California

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
due to the genetic of modified organisms.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
And that this person also claims

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
that this molecular interference

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
can have potential to destroy life

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
within six years.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
Three-fourth that. Have you heard anything about this?

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I heard something about cell phones

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
causing the colony disruption of bees.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Happily that's not an area

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
that it's my responsibility

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
to provide reliable answers on.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
You got to appreciate that the stuff I'm doing

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
is simple enough that a physicist can understand it.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
And the kind of questions that you're asking

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
are at such a higher level of complexity,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I don't really have the right tools

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
to address those kinds of questions,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
because they're in the domain of accident.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
And that's one of the things we work on

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
is how really do you think about a science

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
where history is an important part.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Have you heard of the...

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Yes.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Yes, they have been here in the past.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
They were only bigger and stronger than they are today.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Any given one might only last for a thousand years

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
or 10,000 years,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
and then it dries up and a different one goes someplace else.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
But I didn't mention this about the heaven and the hell theories.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
The heaven theory turns out to come from nuclear fusion,

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
because that's what powers stars.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
The hell theories come from nuclear fission,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
because that's what keeps the inside of the planet hot.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
And it's the process of getting rid of that excess heat

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
that causes the planet to convert heat energy into chemical energy.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And that's what's driving these things.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's why there's a steady rich source of chemistry at those

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
that there may not be on the surface.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I'm going to take two more questions.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Yes.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You bet. You bet.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You know why?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Because there wasn't a self back then.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And that, to me, is one of the most important things

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
that should revise our understanding of biology.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The Darwinian Revolution took for granted

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
that we know what individuals are on the planet.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
We know what individuals are on the planet.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
We know what people are on the planet.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
We know what people are on the planet.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
We know what people are on the planet.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We know what people are on the planet.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
We know for granted that we know what individuals are.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
And that we know what it means for an individual to have offspring.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
But in thermodynamics there are no individuals.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And so there's a big question.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Is the Darwinian dynamics of life completely unrelated

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
to the things we understand?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Or in fact should we recognize that Darwinian dynamics

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
come into existence when individuals come into existence

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and that there is a dynamic before that

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
that continues all the way back

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
and becomes part of the physics?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So in fact what I want to say is

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
you start with the geochemistry.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
You have an ordered geochemistry

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
which is the seeds of biochemistry

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
but there are not individuals yet.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
From biochemistry you get cells

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
because they're the best way

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
to make biochemistry happen

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
and you get the chemistry of ecosystems

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
but still there are no stable individuals.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Later, later, later

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
when it becomes possible to specialize

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
it starts to become worthwhile

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
to have an individuality that persists.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
And then the dynamics that we've all heard of from Darwin

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
starts to become important

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and that's also where accident starts to become important

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
and where family trees begin to show up.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So there's a lovely continuity that goes back

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
but to me it's wonderful.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
We don't have to take the self for granted anymore.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It can be a concept that it is the responsibility of science to derive.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
So let's have

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
there's one right in front here.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
It's a final question.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Well I know there are a lot of experiments

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
that have been done with computer simulations

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
of evolution.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
So this must be very exciting

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
to me.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
We'd like to create a toy model

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and run it through a computer network

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
to see whether a simplified version

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
of 11 simple chemicals

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
that are descending energy

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
train what's involved in this

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
something.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
The devil here is in the details.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Right.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
So this is a place where there's been too much of a gap

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and this time I'll throw mud at the physicists.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
The physicists have stayed with problems

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
that in some sense are simpler

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
than chemistry

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
because the physicists want to say

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
assume a carbon atom is a sphere.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Assume a nitrogen atom is also a sphere of the same kind.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
A nitrogen atom is not the same as a carbon atom.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
What we need to do

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
at the institute and more broadly

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
is to drag physics forward

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and say okay

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
what do all of these ideas

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
of dynamics look like

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
when you have the structure of chemistry

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
where carbon really is different from nitrogen

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and the differences matter.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
But that is exactly the kind of experiment

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
that we and colleagues are trying to do

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
one little baby step at a time.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Right. Thanks Eric.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Okay.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Thank you.
