00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
I'm speaking at SFIs for a public lecture, I think around over 20 years ago, when I was still young, they had a compression on me for thinking that I had new physics type thinking in ecology.

00:12.120 --> 00:29.020
He's been at UC Berkeley, the answer to SFI for a long, long time, doing incredible research. That's a big interface of math, physics, biology, very ecology focused, really asking the deep ecology questions, but bringing the bear whatever tools you can, putting maximum lots of

00:30.020 --> 00:31.020
Thank you, John.

00:33.020 --> 00:34.020
Thank you.

00:35.020 --> 00:42.020
I always enjoy coming here and talking with people and refreshing myself.

00:44.020 --> 00:52.020
I'm going to talk about bungee and forests and a very controversial topic, group selection.

00:53.020 --> 01:12.020
You've probably heard, you can't help but hear about new developments in our understanding, we hope it's real understanding, of forests and the symbiotic relationships that arise in forests with the bacteria and the fungi and the soil.

01:13.020 --> 01:20.020
There's been lots of interesting speculation, some good science and some hype.

01:22.020 --> 01:35.020
Here are some examples of the hype, but there's also real science behind some of the new developments in our understanding of how fungi and trees interact.

01:36.020 --> 01:40.020
The headlines go overboard.

01:41.020 --> 01:49.020
We didn't invent the internet, plants did, and in fact they claim they made it even better than we, than our internet.

01:50.020 --> 02:04.020
There's, of course, inevitable pushback against speculative claims that talk about super organisms and use of the word communication when we talk about the relationships among trees.

02:05.020 --> 02:30.020
The concept of the mother tree has been advanced and opposed by many. Nature, ecology and evolution in 2023 had an article, and I'm just giving one quote from it, positive citation bias and overinterpreted results lead to misinformation on common mycorrhizal networks in forests.

02:31.020 --> 02:46.020
Just last night, a new article in Nature came across my email and it's a review of this whole concept of the mother tree.

02:47.020 --> 02:58.020
The mother tree idea is everywhere now, it wasn't before, but how much of it is real and the article delves into the controversy.

03:01.020 --> 03:14.020
What I want to argue here is that the reality of forests and fungi is much more interesting than anything I've just flashed on the screen for you, and I want to try to convince you of that.

03:15.020 --> 03:19.020
The talk really is in three parts. The first part I think is pretty rock solid.

03:20.020 --> 03:31.020
The second part begins to delve a bit into speculation, but strong support, and the third part is wildly blue sky speculation.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.020
So that's the outline of my talk.

03:35.020 --> 03:53.020
The work I'm going to revisit in the first two-thirds of the talk is work that was initiated actually a long time ago, three decades ago, by a graduate student of mine, Ann Kinzick, who is now an ecology professor at Arizona State.

03:54.020 --> 04:15.020
There were two key papers that came out in the 90s, one in the American Naturalist and one in the British Journal of Ecology, which really go into great detail, and much of my talk will be a summary of the major conclusions from these papers.

04:16.020 --> 04:34.020
The story really begins with the nitrogen cycle, and I've shown here a simple schematic of how nitrogen, an essential nutrient for plants, and microorganisms is cycled.

04:35.020 --> 04:53.020
It's a little bit oversimplified, but it contains the essence of the nitrogen cycle. Green plants die, and the nitrogen in the plants becomes part of the nitrogen in the soil, part of the humus, part of the organic substrate.

04:54.020 --> 05:09.020
If it's a lake, then the nitrogen in the dead algae, or a kelp, or whatever, become dissolved into the water, and you have dissolved organic carbon compounds.

05:10.020 --> 05:27.020
Microbes also die, and their dead little corpses become part of the soil-organic matter pool, and microbes derive their nitrogen directly from the soil-organic matter, what they actually do.

05:27.020 --> 05:43.020
It's a bit more complicated than the diagram suggests. They convert organic nitrogen, like the nitrogen found in amino acids, into inorganic nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate, and then they take up the ammonium and the nitrate.

05:44.020 --> 05:48.020
So it's sort of a little bit roundabout, but that's the way they function.

05:48.020 --> 06:01.020
And the ammonium and nitrate, which is produced by the microbes, chewing on organic matter, is then available for the plants, who also need the nitrogen.

06:02.020 --> 06:17.020
Okay, that's the nitrogen cycle, except I'm not showing you some little tweaks, which are at the one or two percent, maybe five percent level, making this not quite a perfectly closed system.

06:17.020 --> 06:27.020
There's nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere and other processes, leaching, but this is the essence of the cycle.

06:27.020 --> 06:38.020
And now if we turn to what motivated the work I'm going to talk about, a seemingly trivial minor question came up.

06:38.020 --> 06:56.020
I asked it at a symposium on the nitrogen cycle that was taking place at Berkeley, and somebody was presented a diagram more or less like this, and I asked the question, what determines the ratio of B to A in an ecosystem?

06:57.020 --> 07:08.020
Okay, there were all kinds of answers ranging from idiosyncratic or maybe governed by some law, but we don't know what it is.

07:08.020 --> 07:14.020
Actually, a few people in the audience said that the question was ignorant.

07:14.020 --> 07:18.020
It didn't matter what the ratio was, so why ask the question?

07:18.020 --> 07:30.020
Well, it will turn out it does matter, because the ratio will give us some interesting insight into much deeper, bigger issues, like group selection, as we'll see.

07:30.020 --> 07:45.020
So what determines how much of this nutritious, inorganic nitrogen is taken up by microbes, including both fungi and bacteria, and how much is taken up by plants?

07:45.020 --> 07:53.020
How do they share this common resource? They're competing for it, so they've got to figure out a way to share.

07:53.020 --> 08:01.020
Okay, to answer what happened is after that symposium, Ann and I got together and we said, we've got to figure this out.

08:01.020 --> 08:11.020
This seems trivial, but my guess was it was not idiosyncratic, that there was something going on and it would be worth trying to figure it out.

08:11.020 --> 08:21.020
And we realized very quickly that we'd also have to turn to the carbon cycle, not just look alone at the nitrogen cycle, but also carbon.

08:21.020 --> 08:27.020
Okay, here's a pretty picture of the carbon cycle, but maybe this will make things a little more clear.

08:28.020 --> 08:35.020
Green plants take CO2 from the atmosphere. They also respire it back.

08:35.020 --> 08:44.020
And when they die, the dead plant matter becomes the carbon in the soil, the organic carbon.

08:44.020 --> 08:48.020
The organic carbon is chewed up by the microbes.

08:48.020 --> 09:02.020
In fact, the microbes wouldn't exist, at least the current types of microbes, without this carbon because breaking down the carbon bonds in the organic matter in the soil is how they get their energy.

09:02.020 --> 09:13.020
So this is the food that powers the microbes, and then the microbes also respire and produce CO2.

09:13.020 --> 09:25.020
So this is the carbon cycle, and it's important to mention to emphasize that plant-derived organic carbon is the energy source for most microbes.

09:25.020 --> 09:35.020
There are some that can get their energy from other compounds, especially in the deep sea, but we're not going to go into that.

09:35.020 --> 09:40.020
Now, let's combine the two cycles, and we'll see something interesting.

09:40.020 --> 09:47.020
I've just sort of superimposed those pictures that you saw before because they're both going on at the same time.

09:47.020 --> 09:55.020
And now we see that there are two distinct things happening in this combined carbon-nitrogen cycle.

09:55.020 --> 10:00.020
There is mutualism, and by that I mean that microbes need plants.

10:00.020 --> 10:06.020
Microbes require the organic carbon produced by plants to get their energy.

10:06.020 --> 10:15.020
Plants need microbes because without the microbes, all that organic nitrogen would stay in organic form.

10:15.020 --> 10:24.020
The microbes turn it into inorganic nitrate and ammonium, which is what the plants need for their nitrogen supply.

10:24.020 --> 10:30.020
So plants need microbes, microbes need plants. That's a mutualism.

10:30.020 --> 10:38.020
On the other hand, they are both competing for this pool of inorganic nitrogen. That's the AB thing.

10:38.020 --> 10:45.020
So think about it. Suppose one of the two, let's say microbes, control the switch.

10:45.020 --> 10:53.020
They get to go first, and suppose they pig out. They say, we're going to just take as much nitrogen as we can.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.020
What would happen?

10:55.020 --> 11:05.020
Well, there'd be none left over for the plants. Plants would die, and eventually there'd be no carbon for the microbes.

11:05.020 --> 11:18.020
On the other hand, they might be really selfless, utterly extreme altruistic and just forgo nitrogen, leave it all for the plants,

11:18.020 --> 11:29.020
and then what would happen? They would die out, and then eventually the plants wouldn't have nitrate.

11:29.020 --> 11:41.020
So you don't get carbon for the microbes if the microbes pick out, and you don't get nitrogen for the plants if the microbes are overly selfless.

11:41.020 --> 11:48.020
So somewhere in between, there's got to be a happy, medium, optimum point.

11:48.020 --> 11:58.020
You're going to see.

11:58.020 --> 12:04.020
So this is just summarizing what I just said.

12:04.020 --> 12:07.020
In a nutshell, here's the situation.

12:07.020 --> 12:16.020
I want to show you this diagram, because we're going to look for this diagram later on in human society and elsewhere in nature,

12:16.020 --> 12:23.020
and see that it's not just a property of this particular system.

12:23.020 --> 12:26.020
That's where the and us comes in in the title.

12:26.020 --> 12:29.020
Okay, here's the situation in a nutshell.

12:29.020 --> 12:31.020
We have x and y.

12:31.020 --> 12:35.020
Y helps x, x helps y, and they're competing for a resource.

12:35.020 --> 12:41.020
How do you resolve that?

12:41.020 --> 12:48.020
I'm going to first take a look at what I call a microbe maximizing strategy, MMS.

12:48.020 --> 12:53.020
Later we can look at PMS, which is plant maximizing strategy.

12:53.020 --> 12:58.020
So let's pretend the microbes control the gate.

12:58.020 --> 13:00.020
They get to go first.

13:00.020 --> 13:05.020
They take their share and leave the rest for the plants.

13:05.020 --> 13:15.020
We're going to take, make them look at two models, both of which have been validated empirically, and I'll show you how,

13:15.020 --> 13:24.020
to look at what happens in combined nitrogen carbon cycle models to test the MMS hypothesis.

13:24.020 --> 13:30.020
We can say that the hypothesis is microbes allocate to their own growth.

13:30.020 --> 13:37.020
They pick that ratio of B to A, so that they are maximizing their population size.

13:37.020 --> 13:40.020
Let's just look at that as a hypothesis.

13:40.020 --> 13:44.020
See what it predicts, and then see if we can test it.

13:44.020 --> 13:48.020
We can also look at maximizing their growth rate.

13:48.020 --> 13:52.020
I'll show you what happens when you do that as well.

13:52.020 --> 14:01.020
Okay, we'll compare the predictions to available data, and then we're going to, after that,

14:01.020 --> 14:07.020
look at a spatially explicit checkerboard, huge checkerboard,

14:07.020 --> 14:12.020
in other words, a spatially explicit grid-based version of the model,

14:12.020 --> 14:18.020
in which we can actually look at a mechanism that achieves the MMS.

14:18.020 --> 14:24.020
And I'll show you what conditions have to hold in order for the MMS to be valid.

14:24.020 --> 14:33.020
That is to evolve, to undergo Darwinian evolution and come about in reality.

14:33.020 --> 14:39.020
Okay, here are the major assumptions of the two core models I'm going to show you.

14:39.020 --> 14:44.020
I'm not going to go through all these, it will take too long, but I'm ignoring nitrogen fixation

14:44.020 --> 14:51.020
because those little 2% terms that make the nitrogen cycle open rather than closed.

14:51.020 --> 14:57.020
And I'm going to ignore diurnal, et cetera, variation, stochastic variation.

14:57.020 --> 15:01.020
I'm going to assume the system in some average way is in a steady state.

15:01.020 --> 15:08.020
I'm not going to look at highly disturbed ecosystems, which are different tomorrow than they are today,

15:08.020 --> 15:12.020
very different next year than they are this year.

15:12.020 --> 15:18.020
I'm going to look at a quasi-steady state and a bunch of other assumptions.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.020
They're all explicitly listed.

15:20.020 --> 15:24.020
I think I've listed every assumption we've made.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.020
And there are two models.

15:26.020 --> 15:33.020
One I call the rhizosphere model, and it's sketched over here.

15:33.020 --> 15:39.020
We have the organic nitrogen, which I just call N now.

15:39.020 --> 15:47.020
This is the dead plant matter and dead microbe matter that contains organic forms of nitrogen,

15:47.020 --> 15:54.020
the plants, the microbes, and the inorganic nitrogen, which I'm calling I.

15:54.020 --> 16:03.020
And you can write down a set of equations that are generalizations of what's called the Latke-Vulterra equations

16:03.020 --> 16:06.020
in ecology, which many of you know about.

16:06.020 --> 16:14.020
And they are sort of the simplest things you can write down in the form of differential equations

16:14.020 --> 16:21.020
that contain a description of the processes that are shown in the diagram.

16:21.020 --> 16:23.020
It's a minimal model.

16:23.020 --> 16:26.020
It's what I like to call a spherical cow model.

16:26.020 --> 16:29.020
You can make it much more complicated, and we've done that.

16:29.020 --> 16:33.020
We've looked at relaxing the assumptions one by one.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.020
Do they change the predictions?

16:35.020 --> 16:46.020
The answer is no, unless some huge, like if two-thirds of the nitrogen leeches out of the forest every year,

16:46.020 --> 16:52.020
then you would start to violate the predictions that we make.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.020
So why a rhizosphere model?

16:54.020 --> 16:58.020
Well, you'll notice I don't have an organic carbon pool in here.

16:58.020 --> 17:02.020
I don't have the organic carbon in the soil.

17:02.020 --> 17:11.020
Why? Because the microbes are getting their carbon from the roots of the plants.

17:11.020 --> 17:16.020
Not the roots, actually, but the fungi that infest the roots.

17:16.020 --> 17:23.020
These are called rhizospheric fungi, and we don't have to include a separate carbon pool.

17:23.020 --> 17:31.020
We can just call it the plant pool because the plant roots are the place where this action occurs.

17:31.020 --> 17:41.020
It's a little bit oversimplified in that sense, but I'll show you next a carbon model that contains maybe things you're happier with.

17:41.020 --> 17:52.020
Here's the carbon model, and it's very much like the rhizosphere model, except now there's an explicit carbon pool that's separate from the plant pool,

17:52.020 --> 17:59.020
rather than the carbon pool being in the roots of the plants.

17:59.020 --> 18:10.020
Okay, I'll use the symbols P, M, N, and I to refer to the nitrogen content in these pools.

18:10.020 --> 18:14.020
That is, the nitrogen content of the plants will be labeled P.

18:14.020 --> 18:18.020
So this isn't the mass of a tree, the trees in the forest.

18:18.020 --> 18:25.020
It's the mass of the nitrogen in the trees in the forest, and the same is true for the microbes.

18:25.020 --> 18:33.020
The unit, the thing that's flowing around in the model is nitrogen, not carbohydrate,

18:33.020 --> 18:38.020
the complicated organic compounds.

18:38.020 --> 18:45.020
The carbon model, the rhizosphere model describes many forests.

18:45.020 --> 18:55.020
Forests tend to have lots of rhizospheric fungi, and we kind of think of the rhizosphere model as a forest model.

18:55.020 --> 19:05.020
The carbon model is a good model for aquatic systems, where you don't have roots infested with rhizospheric fungi.

19:05.020 --> 19:10.020
Farmland and annual grassland, and some forests.

19:10.020 --> 19:16.020
Conifer forests tend to look more like the rhizosphere model, deciduous forests,

19:16.020 --> 19:19.020
in some cases would look more like the carbon model.

19:19.020 --> 19:27.020
We're going to look at both of these models and run them in parallel and see what kinds of predictions they make.

19:27.020 --> 19:30.020
Okay, just a quick note.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.020
Why should we trust the models?

19:32.020 --> 19:37.020
The best way to test a model is not to look at what it says about steady states,

19:37.020 --> 19:47.020
but to kick the system, perturb it, and then ask the model, can you predict the response to the perturbation?

19:47.020 --> 19:55.020
It's a much more realistic and thorough way to test a model.

19:55.020 --> 20:02.020
So we've set up systems, in this case I'm just showing you the results for some aquatic systems,

20:02.020 --> 20:12.020
for which we use the carbon model, and what we did is we took buckets of water out of a biologically rich lake,

20:12.020 --> 20:20.020
set up replicate microcosms in the laboratory, and added organic carbon to them,

20:20.020 --> 20:25.020
and then asked how does it get distributed over time,

20:25.020 --> 20:38.020
and in particular we asked about the concentration of the inorganic nitrogen that rises as the microbes start to eat the organic matter

20:38.020 --> 20:46.020
that was added experimentally as a manipulation to the microcosms.

20:46.020 --> 20:58.020
So picture rows and rows of replicate buckets of water, and adding different amounts of organic carbon to replicate systems.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.020
Yeah.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.020
What was the DOM that you added?

21:01.020 --> 21:02.020
I'm sorry, what?

21:02.020 --> 21:04.020
What was the DOM that you added?

21:04.020 --> 21:07.020
Like glucose or glutamate?

21:07.020 --> 21:10.020
What was the organic matter?

21:10.020 --> 21:14.020
Yeah, it was dead microbes.

21:14.020 --> 21:23.020
That turned out to be something we could make, and it was uniform and rapidly digestible by other microbes.

21:23.020 --> 21:27.020
We didn't want to add something recalcitrant because it would take too long.

21:27.020 --> 21:31.020
And as you can see, we ran this thing for about a week,

21:31.020 --> 21:39.020
and what we saw experimentally is the inorganic nitrogen level shot up,

21:39.020 --> 21:47.020
depending on how much addition of organic carbon we added to the system.

21:47.020 --> 21:53.020
So if you make a 48 percent increase in the amount of organic carbon,

21:53.020 --> 21:58.020
you don't see any increase at all, undetectable, in the inorganic nitrogen.

21:58.020 --> 22:01.020
But if you double it, you see a big increase.

22:01.020 --> 22:09.020
So there's sort of a threshold effect in here, and 180 percent goes up, 300 percent even higher.

22:09.020 --> 22:17.020
Notice it peaks at a later and later time, so there's a lag effect, the lead peak, and a threshold effect.

22:17.020 --> 22:18.020
Okay.

22:18.020 --> 22:27.020
Since it's an aquatic system, we use the carbon model to evaluate what should happen in the model if you do this experiment to it.

22:27.020 --> 22:29.020
And this is what the model predicts.

22:29.020 --> 22:41.020
There was only one adjustable parameter, which referred to the degree of what's called density dependence in the death rates of the microbes.

22:41.020 --> 22:44.020
That's a thing that's hard to measure directly.

22:44.020 --> 22:49.020
And in fact, this experiment provided a way to measure density dependence,

22:49.020 --> 22:54.020
because if you tweak density dependence a little bit, your predictions start to look different.

22:54.020 --> 22:58.020
But we capture with the model the threshold and the delayed peak.

22:58.020 --> 23:01.020
So we have confidence in the model.

23:01.020 --> 23:04.020
That's really all this slide is supposed to tell you.

23:04.020 --> 23:07.020
Just make a couple definitions.

23:07.020 --> 23:16.020
I'm going to let rho be the ratio of two ratios, the ratio of the C to N ratio of the microbes.

23:16.020 --> 23:23.020
That's carbon to nitrogen divided by the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in plants.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.020
This is usually a small number.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.020
This is typically about six.

23:27.020 --> 23:35.020
This is often anywhere from eight or 10 to 30 or 40, depending on the type of plant.

23:35.020 --> 23:44.020
So there's a flow weighted ratio of carbon to nitrogen in plants, microbes.

23:44.020 --> 23:52.020
And so it's always less than one empirically, although theoretically there's no reason why it couldn't be bigger than one.

23:53.020 --> 24:01.020
Alpha will be the ratio of the amount of nitrogen in plants.

24:01.020 --> 24:09.020
That's what we call capital P before, plus capital I, the amount of inorganic nitrogen in the plants.

24:09.020 --> 24:17.020
It's the ratio of the sum of those two pools of nitrogen to twice the nitrogen in the dead organic matter.

24:17.020 --> 24:22.020
So in symbols it's P plus I divided by two N.

24:22.020 --> 24:30.020
And alpha's always much less than one in any real ecosystem for which data are available.

24:30.020 --> 24:43.020
The soil contains much more nitrogen than in the inorganic form than is in the nitrogen in plants and in the inorganic pool.

24:44.020 --> 24:51.020
This next symbol, beta, is the thing we set out questioning.

24:51.020 --> 24:57.020
What's the ratio of B to A or A to A plus B in our previous notation?

24:57.020 --> 25:10.020
So the question now is if we take those models and look at their steady states

25:10.020 --> 25:16.020
by solving the simultaneous equations with the derivative set to zero

25:16.020 --> 25:25.020
and then maximize microbial biomass, what does it predict about this quantity beta?

25:25.020 --> 25:31.020
And we'll see it to be a function of alpha and rho, both of which are very easily measured.

25:31.020 --> 25:34.020
So that's the strategy.

25:35.020 --> 25:47.020
The math, I think as I recall it was about 10 or 15 pages of legal pad size algebra

25:47.020 --> 25:54.020
to solve for the maximum, to solve the simultaneous equations and get the solution.

25:54.020 --> 25:59.020
For the carbon model, this is beta as a function of rho and alpha.

25:59.020 --> 26:03.020
I know it's ugly, but it just really does come out.

26:03.020 --> 26:06.020
Notice there are two solutions with a plus and minus sign.

26:06.020 --> 26:13.020
Both of these lead to positive values of beta and you asked about multiple solutions.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.020
There they are, there are two.

26:15.020 --> 26:21.020
In the rhizosphere model, there's only one solution, beta is one half minus alpha.

26:21.020 --> 26:28.020
And again, alpha and beta, sorry, yeah, rho and alpha are easily measured.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.020
And the rhizosphere model, rho doesn't matter.

26:35.020 --> 26:43.020
If we put in real numbers from various data sets, we looked at about 30 data sets

26:43.020 --> 26:47.020
to get estimated ranges of alpha and rho.

26:47.020 --> 26:55.020
And what we get as a prediction is in the carbon model beta should be between 0.75 and 0.95

26:55.020 --> 26:58.020
or between 0.05 and 0.2.

26:58.020 --> 27:04.020
In other words, microbes either take a relatively small share or a very large share.

27:04.020 --> 27:17.020
In the case of the rhizosphere model, beta is one half minus alpha, alpha is very small

27:17.020 --> 27:22.020
and beta has come out to be between 0.45 and 0.50.

27:22.020 --> 27:31.020
So in rhizosphere applicable systems like many far, most far as,

27:31.020 --> 27:38.020
we expect roughly a 50-50 division of alpha, of A and B.

27:38.020 --> 27:43.020
And here are some data.

27:44.020 --> 27:49.020
Well, I'm summarizing a bunch of data.

27:49.020 --> 27:58.020
For the carbon model where aquatic systems are the best example,

27:58.020 --> 28:07.020
tropical lagoon value of 0.89, a temperate deciduous forest with lots of rhizosphere at Fungi,

28:07.020 --> 28:12.020
a value of 0.79 within the range predicted.

28:12.020 --> 28:19.020
A largely rhizospheric system prediction was between 0.45 and 0.50.

28:19.020 --> 28:25.020
A perennial shortgrass prairie had a value of right on the nose at 0.50.

28:25.020 --> 28:35.020
We don't have good data for forests that are not rhizospheric.

28:35.020 --> 28:40.020
There are very few people make these measurements of both A and B.

28:40.020 --> 28:46.020
It turns out you have to do something called nitrogen isotope pool dilution,

28:46.020 --> 28:53.020
which is a very tricky and complicated empirical method for deriving

28:53.020 --> 28:59.020
what biogeochemists call the net and the gross nitrogen mineralization rates.

28:59.020 --> 29:01.020
So there's not a lot of data.

29:01.020 --> 29:05.020
So we don't have strong support empirically for the theory.

29:05.020 --> 29:09.020
We have consistent consistency with the theory,

29:09.020 --> 29:15.020
but not strong overwhelming support with 30, 40, 50 databases.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.020
We just don't have the data.

29:17.020 --> 29:28.020
An annual grassland system, which was characterized as having a mix of free-living and rhizospheric microbes.

29:28.020 --> 29:31.020
So neither model would be directly applicable,

29:31.020 --> 29:42.020
and the authors of the paper didn't know what the ratio was of the free-living to the rhizospheric microorganisms.

29:42.020 --> 29:46.020
Its beta value fell outside the range of any of our predictions.

29:46.020 --> 29:49.020
It's not obviously MMS, but it might be.

29:49.020 --> 29:53.020
We'd have to know more about the system in order to use that data set.

29:53.020 --> 30:00.020
Okay, so we have suggestive but not overwhelming evidence for the MMS.

30:00.020 --> 30:05.020
The question then arises, how might the MMS evolve?

30:05.020 --> 30:11.020
Let's first naively think about two types of microbes.

30:11.020 --> 30:16.020
Strategists that follow the micro-maximizing strategy.

30:16.020 --> 30:22.020
These are the guys that know how to maximize that function and they obey it.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.020
We'll call them strategists.

30:24.020 --> 30:28.020
I don't want to call them altruists for a reason we'll get to later.

30:28.020 --> 30:36.020
I think this is a little different from altruism as it's conventionally and usefully defined.

30:36.020 --> 30:44.020
And then we'll have tacticians who pig out at a rate far exceeding the micro-maximizing strategy rate.

30:44.020 --> 30:46.020
Okay, what happens?

30:46.020 --> 30:56.020
Well, if we have two jugs of water and we put tacticians or pig out pigs in one bucket

30:56.020 --> 31:01.020
and strategists in the other bucket, you can guess what will happen.

31:01.020 --> 31:06.020
The tacticians grow faster at first because they have a higher uptake rate,

31:06.020 --> 31:09.020
but they reach a lower level.

31:09.020 --> 31:14.020
The strategists start out slowly and reach a higher level.

31:14.020 --> 31:19.020
So the microbes that can do the math end up better off.

31:19.020 --> 31:28.020
But if you put those together in the same bucket, then what's going to happen?

31:28.020 --> 31:33.020
Well, you can do it mathematically, but you can also do the experiment.

31:33.020 --> 31:40.020
And the experiment has been done in many guises.

31:40.020 --> 31:46.020
And what happens is the strategists are outcompeted by the tacticians.

31:46.020 --> 31:53.020
In this phase of growth, the tacticians outnumber the microbes, they outcompete them,

31:53.020 --> 31:56.020
and they actually eventually die out.

31:56.020 --> 31:58.020
And you can see it by running the model,

31:58.020 --> 32:05.020
but as I said, the people have also done these competition experiments with organisms with different traits.

32:05.020 --> 32:14.020
So that says nature doesn't have organisms living completely isolated from each other,

32:14.020 --> 32:20.020
and we don't see that or that.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.020
So what's going on?

32:22.020 --> 32:28.020
Well, to go further, I'm going to show you just the result.

32:28.020 --> 32:33.020
I'm not going to try to show you how the model actually works in detail.

32:33.020 --> 32:38.020
But what we did is we set up a large, spatially explicit grid.

32:38.020 --> 32:43.020
I think it was 64 by 64 cells, big checkerboard.

32:43.020 --> 32:49.020
And we populated it with microorganisms and trees.

32:49.020 --> 32:51.020
Populated it in the model.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.020
We didn't do this experiment.

32:53.020 --> 32:59.020
It would be a lovely experiment to try to do, but I don't think NSF would fund it.

32:59.020 --> 33:09.020
So this is a very typical approach in certain areas of evolutionary biology

33:09.020 --> 33:17.020
to set up spatially explicit models and allow for several things to happen.

33:17.020 --> 33:22.020
You can't just leave each grid cell isolated from the next one,

33:22.020 --> 33:25.020
or else it will look like that figure I showed you earlier.

33:25.020 --> 33:28.020
And you can't have the mix very rapidly,

33:28.020 --> 33:32.020
because then it will look like the other bucket experiment I showed you,

33:32.020 --> 33:37.020
where the mixing causes the die-out of the strategies.

33:37.020 --> 33:40.020
So we want something in between.

33:40.020 --> 33:47.020
We're also going to look at four genotypes of the microbe.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.020
I should say phenotype.

33:49.020 --> 33:52.020
We don't really look at genes in this model.

33:52.020 --> 33:54.020
We have overly selfless.

33:54.020 --> 33:57.020
We have the strategic optimizers.

33:57.020 --> 34:02.020
These are the guys that solve the math,

34:02.020 --> 34:07.020
and then an intermediate, higher level of uptake,

34:07.020 --> 34:09.020
and then the tactical glutton.

34:09.020 --> 34:12.020
So we have these four types of microbes,

34:12.020 --> 34:17.020
and we're going to populate different types randomly across that grid.

34:17.020 --> 34:22.020
In each cell, we'll get one type chosen at random from the four.

34:22.020 --> 34:27.020
We're going to populate every cell with some plants.

34:27.020 --> 34:30.020
They're not going to differ genetically or phenotypically.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.020
They're just plants.

34:32.020 --> 34:38.020
Another step in this whole thing would be to put in different varieties of plants.

34:38.020 --> 34:42.020
But mathematically, I don't think it matters.

34:42.020 --> 34:44.020
Random assignment of the microbe.

34:44.020 --> 34:49.020
Oh, it's a 50 by 50 grid, not 64 by 64.

34:49.020 --> 34:56.020
We're going to allow weak diffusion of inorganic nitrogen between nearest neighbors.

34:56.020 --> 34:59.020
So we're going to have a diffusion constant.

34:59.020 --> 35:02.020
Nitrogen can leak from one cell to its neighbor.

35:02.020 --> 35:11.020
And we're going to do random extirpation of microbes and plants in grid cells

35:11.020 --> 35:16.020
with recolonization by the nearest neighbor at the most biomass.

35:16.020 --> 35:23.020
That is, you take a cell and now and then wipe it off the board

35:23.020 --> 35:30.020
and repopulate it with this offspring of the nearest neighbors to it,

35:30.020 --> 35:36.020
whichever nearest neighbor has the highest number of the highest biomass of microbes.

35:36.020 --> 35:44.020
So that's really the numerical experiment is right there.

35:44.020 --> 35:49.020
And I'm not going to tell you how we run it and all that stuff.

35:49.020 --> 35:53.020
I just want to show you quickly some of the results.

35:53.020 --> 36:03.020
Black means the optimizers, A2, are the dominant at the end of the run.

36:03.020 --> 36:09.020
White means the selfish guys ended up at the end of the run.

36:09.020 --> 36:11.020
These are the gluttons.

36:11.020 --> 36:14.020
And gray was at A3.

36:14.020 --> 36:20.020
It's sort of an intermediate between optimizer and glutton.

36:20.020 --> 36:24.020
And I'm not going to show you A1 because they all died out in every run.

36:24.020 --> 36:27.020
This poor selfless microbes disappear.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.020
They get out and competed.

36:29.020 --> 36:33.020
So the rhizosphere model is shown here.

36:33.020 --> 36:36.020
And the carbon model is shown here.

36:36.020 --> 36:42.020
And what's shown on these axes are diffusion rates.

36:42.020 --> 36:56.020
The two sets within the rhizosphere model represent low rate of plant disturbance

36:56.020 --> 36:58.020
and a high rate of plant disturbance.

36:58.020 --> 37:01.020
Because we also displace the plant.

37:01.020 --> 37:05.020
We extirpate the plants every now and then as well.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.020
And as you can see, it makes a difference.

37:07.020 --> 37:18.020
At a high rate, you get far fewer dominance of the optimizers.

37:18.020 --> 37:19.020
Oh, yeah.

37:19.020 --> 37:25.020
Epsilon is the rate of microbe extirpation.

37:25.020 --> 37:30.020
And delta is the rate of diffusion of nitrogen between neighbors.

37:30.020 --> 37:35.020
But in the rhizosphere model with low plant disturbance, quite a few,

37:35.020 --> 37:44.020
but by no means all, of the runs under these different conditions of epsilon and delta

37:44.020 --> 37:50.020
lead to dominance of the micromexamizing bacteria.

37:50.020 --> 37:55.020
In the carbon model, there's only a few.

37:55.020 --> 38:03.020
It makes a low diffusion rate and a low extirpation rate.

38:03.020 --> 38:12.020
So this is kind of evidence for that it could exist.

38:12.020 --> 38:15.020
These can evolve under certain conditions.

38:15.020 --> 38:23.020
But there are many conditions in which the micromexamizing strategy won't evolve.

38:23.020 --> 38:26.020
But when you look in detail, it kind of makes sense.

38:26.020 --> 38:31.020
If you have too high a rate of diffusion, there's too much mingling.

38:31.020 --> 38:37.020
Or if you have too high a rate of extirpation, there's too high a rate of mingling.

38:37.020 --> 38:47.020
And then you're back effectively to the situation in this model, this situation,

38:47.020 --> 38:49.020
where you have mixing.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.020
Too much mixing, bad.

38:51.020 --> 38:56.020
No mixing would work, but it's not what happens in nature.

38:56.020 --> 39:05.020
And so this is a summary then of what the models predict for outcomes

39:05.020 --> 39:14.020
under different rates of extirpation, different rates of diffusion.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.020
What's going on?

39:17.020 --> 39:23.020
What led to even some of those grid cells becoming all black,

39:23.020 --> 39:26.020
all optimizing at the end of the run?

39:26.020 --> 39:33.020
It's an example of what Ed Wilson and David Sloan Wilson, the two Wilson's,

39:33.020 --> 39:42.020
who are strong advocates of group selection being important in nature,

39:42.020 --> 39:44.020
what they call group selection.

39:44.020 --> 39:53.020
Group selection is a concept that had come under huge ridicule,

39:53.020 --> 39:59.020
scorn, and fire in the 60s and 70s by evolutionary biologists who said,

39:59.020 --> 40:03.020
group selection, theoretically maybe it could occur,

40:03.020 --> 40:11.020
but the conditions under which it can arise are so extreme that you'll never see it in nature.

40:11.020 --> 40:16.020
And since then, Ed Wilson has shown, I think, convincingly,

40:16.020 --> 40:22.020
but not everybody agrees that group selection explains much of the reason

40:22.020 --> 40:27.020
for the origin of sociality in insects,

40:27.020 --> 40:34.020
that group selection rather than kin selection is a dominating mechanism

40:34.020 --> 40:40.020
in the evolution of social, sociality in bees and ants and so on.

40:41.020 --> 40:49.020
In group selection, you select an outcome that would generally not arise

40:49.020 --> 40:53.020
if all the phenotypes were well mixed all the time.

40:53.020 --> 40:59.020
So it requires some kind of spatial separation, but not too much.

40:59.020 --> 41:04.020
If you don't have any mixing, then you don't get that outcome either.

41:04.020 --> 41:09.020
And nothing in nature is completely isolated.

41:09.020 --> 41:13.020
So that's not an option.

41:13.020 --> 41:18.020
Group selection, in our example, can lead to behavior

41:18.020 --> 41:25.020
which would reasonably be called altruistic if the groups were well mixed.

41:25.020 --> 41:37.020
That is, if you see a population of microbes behaving at this optimal point,

41:37.020 --> 41:42.020
you would say that they were altruistic if you didn't know

41:42.020 --> 41:49.020
that they came to dominance by a group selection mechanism.

41:49.020 --> 41:55.020
You would think that they could have been more greedy.

41:55.020 --> 41:58.020
They could have been gluttonous and done better.

41:58.020 --> 42:02.020
The model says they wouldn't, but you would think they could

42:02.020 --> 42:06.020
if you didn't know about the model and about the group selection process

42:06.020 --> 42:08.020
and you would call them altruistic.

42:08.020 --> 42:13.020
But one of them would have done better if none of the others changed.

42:13.020 --> 42:14.020
Exactly.

42:14.020 --> 42:16.020
But in our altruists...

42:16.020 --> 42:19.020
Yeah, in that case they would be truly altruistic.

42:19.020 --> 42:21.020
But that is the case you describe.

42:21.020 --> 42:22.020
In what?

42:22.020 --> 42:24.020
That's the case you describe.

42:24.020 --> 42:26.020
An altruist is somebody who, by shifting...

42:26.020 --> 42:30.020
Yeah, that's a perfectly good definition of altruism.

42:30.020 --> 42:33.020
Yeah, so why do you resist calling them altruists?

42:33.020 --> 42:42.020
Because it's evolving in a situation in which they are...

42:42.020 --> 42:49.020
Each individual microbe is better off this way than being off the grid.

42:49.020 --> 42:56.020
Wait, each individual microbe is not best responding to the strategies as you call them.

42:56.020 --> 42:59.020
They're doing what's best for them collectively.

42:59.020 --> 43:04.020
But one of them would do better if they deviated.

43:04.020 --> 43:07.020
Do better in isolation or in that environment?

43:07.020 --> 43:09.020
In that environment as well.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.020
It would do better in the short term.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.020
Yes.

43:13.020 --> 43:16.020
But in the long term, its progeny wouldn't be there.

43:16.020 --> 43:19.020
That genotype would die out.

43:19.020 --> 43:23.020
Yeah, so do we want to use the word altruistic?

43:23.020 --> 43:28.020
I mean, in the next 24 hours I'm better off or do I want it to mean

43:28.020 --> 43:34.020
I'm leaving a future lineage that has my traits.

43:34.020 --> 43:36.020
So that's the distance.

43:36.020 --> 43:38.020
That's why I don't like to use the word altruistic

43:38.020 --> 43:40.020
because I'd like to use the word altruistic.

43:40.020 --> 43:45.020
I mean, not just the next 24 hours, but in the long run.

43:45.020 --> 43:47.020
Well, you've defined altruism as such a way

43:47.020 --> 43:50.020
that it could never evolve by natural selection.

43:50.020 --> 43:51.020
That's right.

43:51.020 --> 43:52.020
That's right.

43:52.020 --> 43:54.020
Exactly.

43:54.020 --> 43:56.020
You do know we do.

43:56.020 --> 43:57.020
Exactly.

43:57.020 --> 43:59.020
I don't like, I like to use the word altruism

43:59.020 --> 44:01.020
for something that doesn't occur.

44:01.020 --> 44:02.020
Right?

44:02.020 --> 44:03.020
Yeah.

44:03.020 --> 44:05.020
I'd like to reserve that word.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.020
A long time ago.

44:07.020 --> 44:09.020
It's just a personality version of the genuine.

44:09.020 --> 44:10.020
Yeah.

44:10.020 --> 44:11.020
Yeah.

44:11.020 --> 44:15.020
So altruism in game theory.

44:15.020 --> 44:16.020
I'm sorry, when?

44:16.020 --> 44:19.020
Altruism in game theory is defined as you say.

44:19.020 --> 44:22.020
Yes, as did Marcus Feldman and all the other people.

44:22.020 --> 44:24.020
I mean, I didn't invent that definition.

44:24.020 --> 44:25.020
Right.

44:25.020 --> 44:26.020
No, I know.

44:26.020 --> 44:29.020
So altruism in evolutionary theory is defined as the way you say it.

44:29.020 --> 44:30.020
Okay.

44:30.020 --> 44:35.020
So if I'm going to, if I use the word altruism the way you and Mark do,

44:35.020 --> 44:37.020
then okay, fine.

44:37.020 --> 44:42.020
But I would like to reserve it for,

44:42.020 --> 44:46.020
I would like to think more about what lineage has survived

44:46.020 --> 44:48.020
over revolutionary time.

44:48.020 --> 44:50.020
I love your model.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.020
What?

44:51.020 --> 44:53.020
I love this model.

44:53.020 --> 44:54.020
Yeah.

44:55.020 --> 44:59.020
Practically, I, he's talking about the reality of the situation is

44:59.020 --> 45:03.020
that we aren't simply living day to day,

45:03.020 --> 45:07.020
but really the reality of what survives in this world throughout time

45:07.020 --> 45:10.020
is the long term picture.

45:10.020 --> 45:12.020
I just got a couple more things to go through.

45:12.020 --> 45:15.020
One is just in case you were curious,

45:15.020 --> 45:18.020
suppose I flipped the coin over and said,

45:18.020 --> 45:21.020
let's do a plant maximizing strategy.

45:21.020 --> 45:24.020
Would we get the same outcome?

45:24.020 --> 45:30.020
And the answer is just about this.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.020
Oh, sorry.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.020
No, this is different.

45:32.020 --> 45:37.020
This is instead of maximizing biomass of microbes,

45:37.020 --> 45:42.020
suppose we might maximize their growth rate in the study state,

45:42.020 --> 45:45.020
their gross growth rate.

45:45.020 --> 45:50.020
If we do that, we get almost the same optimal point.

45:50.020 --> 45:52.020
Here's a one, a two.

45:52.020 --> 45:55.020
Here's the macro maximizing curve.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.020
Here's the plant maximizing curve.

45:58.020 --> 46:00.020
Not very different.

46:00.020 --> 46:03.020
It'd be hard to tell them apart.

46:03.020 --> 46:14.020
And I thought I had a slide of the plant micro.

46:14.020 --> 46:15.020
Oh, yeah.

46:15.020 --> 46:17.020
Here, several, a couple of slides.

46:17.020 --> 46:19.020
What about a plant maximizing strategy?

46:19.020 --> 46:33.020
In this case, the outcome is nearly similar to what we had before,

46:33.020 --> 46:35.020
but not quite.

46:35.020 --> 46:39.020
In the case of a plant micro maximizing strategy,

46:39.020 --> 46:47.020
beta instead of one half minus alpha is one half plus alpha and alpha prime.

46:47.020 --> 46:53.020
And alpha prime, instead of p plus i over 2n, is m plus i over 2n.

46:53.020 --> 46:59.020
So it's almost a symmetric result when you maximize the plant biomass.

46:59.020 --> 47:04.020
And in all the systems we have, alpha prime is very small,

47:04.020 --> 47:09.020
and so the two results converge on the beta equals a half result

47:09.020 --> 47:13.020
for the rhizosphere model.

47:13.020 --> 47:18.020
The carbon model turns out not to have a solution

47:18.020 --> 47:22.020
if you have plant maximizing strategy.

47:22.020 --> 47:24.020
It just doesn't have a maximum point.

47:24.020 --> 47:32.020
Plants should just pick out if they had control of the inorganic nitrogen switch.

47:32.020 --> 47:38.020
But now I want to turn to the most loose guy part of this talk,

47:38.020 --> 47:45.020
which is what else might this basic diagram that I showed you at the beginning describe

47:45.020 --> 47:51.020
to mutualists competing for a resource?

47:51.020 --> 47:57.020
These pollinators on plants provide a possible example.

47:57.020 --> 48:00.020
These help plants by pollinating.

48:00.020 --> 48:04.020
Plants help bees by supplying nectar,

48:04.020 --> 48:09.020
but the resource that the plants make the nectar from

48:09.020 --> 48:14.020
is competed for by both the pollinators and the plants.

48:14.020 --> 48:17.020
The plants could use that nectar for some other purpose,

48:17.020 --> 48:21.020
like making bigger roots and becoming more drought resistant.

48:21.020 --> 48:24.020
But no, they use it to attract pollinators.

48:24.020 --> 48:29.020
So again, we could ask the question, and we haven't done this,

48:29.020 --> 48:32.020
but I'm just posing it as something interesting that could be done

48:32.020 --> 48:39.020
but the same kind of reasoning is to look at the question of allocation of nectar

48:39.020 --> 48:44.020
and resources between plants and microbes.

48:44.020 --> 48:47.020
What about the human economy?

48:47.020 --> 48:50.020
This is really the reason why I decided to give this talk,

48:50.020 --> 48:55.020
because I think especially during the Reagan and Trump years

48:55.020 --> 48:59.020
when you start to think about how big an issue it is

48:59.020 --> 49:03.020
with what we do with national income.

49:03.020 --> 49:06.020
How do we allocate it?

49:06.020 --> 49:12.020
Let's call the wealth of the nation, it's capital wealth.

49:12.020 --> 49:17.020
And Sam, I want you to really chime in here because I'm misusing terms

49:17.020 --> 49:20.020
and I'm sure I'm botching the economics,

49:20.020 --> 49:27.020
but I want to get you to help me think about this better.

49:27.020 --> 49:32.020
We can use it to increase industrial production, factory output,

49:32.020 --> 49:41.020
material goods, other things that we need or don't need but still produce, plastic.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.020
This is plastic.

49:43.020 --> 49:48.020
Okay, so we can use capital wealth to improve that.

49:48.020 --> 49:56.020
One way to get more capital wealth going into production is to lower taxes on businesses.

49:56.020 --> 49:58.020
Make them more wealthy.

49:58.020 --> 50:01.020
Then there's less wealth left over for the environment,

50:01.020 --> 50:06.020
for public health, education, et cetera, et cetera.

50:06.020 --> 50:10.020
I'm just going to lump all these things, you just call it EHE,

50:10.020 --> 50:14.020
environment, health, and etiquette, but it includes more than this.

50:14.020 --> 50:19.020
It's the things that are not made in factories

50:19.020 --> 50:26.020
and make life worth living.

50:26.020 --> 50:34.020
The mutualism is that EHE requires capital produced by production.

50:34.020 --> 50:41.020
Production requires EHE, so each needs the other.

50:42.020 --> 50:54.020
The mutualism that EHE requires production is actually through capital wealth.

50:54.020 --> 51:01.020
We can also argue about environmental degradation and its destructive effects on capital wealth,

51:01.020 --> 51:05.020
but we don't even need to put that in, even though it's important.

51:05.020 --> 51:22.020
Competition is obvious, both production and EHE compete for capital wealth.

51:22.020 --> 51:31.020
It's the same diagram we had before with the fungi in the forest or the bee in the flower.

51:31.020 --> 51:36.020
There ought to be an optimal allocation of wealth.

51:36.020 --> 51:48.020
You could set up a model and put in reasonable functions describing the flows

51:48.020 --> 51:57.020
and ask what determines the ratio of A over B,

51:57.020 --> 52:02.020
the ratio of capital wealth to EHE versus capital wealth to production,

52:02.020 --> 52:06.020
or better yet, what should determine A over B,

52:06.020 --> 52:12.020
or more specifically, what taxation, budgetary policies, et cetera,

52:12.020 --> 52:15.020
would result in the optimal allocation.

52:15.020 --> 52:18.020
You'll get a solution and then you can ask,

52:18.020 --> 52:22.020
does it look anything like where the U.S. and other wealthy nations are now?

52:22.020 --> 52:31.020
Are we near an optimal point given the simultaneous mutualism and cooperation?

52:31.020 --> 52:38.020
I looked at a model which I just cooked up.

52:38.020 --> 52:42.020
I had a little bit of help from Herman Daly doing this.

52:42.020 --> 52:46.020
I guess you all know he died tragically this year,

52:46.020 --> 52:51.020
but Herman was interested in the stuff I was doing.

52:51.020 --> 52:59.020
He sketched how one might put it together and make a model.

52:59.020 --> 53:03.020
We're going to maximize some kind of objective function, W,

53:03.020 --> 53:06.020
which is some measure of the utility function.

53:06.020 --> 53:12.020
It's a measure of the things we want in our economy, in our life.

53:13.020 --> 53:17.020
I just cooked up the absolutely simplest possible,

53:17.020 --> 53:24.020
and I'm sure economists will ruin about this and can help me with it.

53:24.020 --> 53:31.020
I wrote equations for welfare as a function of P and E.

53:31.020 --> 53:37.020
E stands for EHE. I just lumped it all into E.

53:37.020 --> 53:40.020
Then I wrote, instead of differential equations,

53:41.020 --> 53:46.020
productivity at time I is productivity at time I minus 1

53:46.020 --> 53:52.020
times some combination of capital and E,

53:52.020 --> 53:57.020
which is required to make more production.

53:57.020 --> 54:06.020
Educated labor force, for example, is in this symbol E.

54:07.020 --> 54:13.020
Then you can write equations for how E is degraded by production,

54:13.020 --> 54:19.020
and it's enhanced by capital wealth flowing to the education sector.

54:19.020 --> 54:28.020
Capital itself increases because of production and interest on capital here.

54:28.020 --> 54:34.020
The question then is how can we vary this critical parameter W,

54:34.020 --> 54:40.020
which is a way of thinking about the allocation ratio

54:40.020 --> 54:43.020
in order to maximize W up here.

54:43.020 --> 54:46.020
When you solve that there is an optimum,

54:46.020 --> 54:51.020
I have no idea how to put in numbers for the variables

54:51.020 --> 54:53.020
and make it look realistic.

54:53.020 --> 54:57.020
I just don't know enough economics to know how to do that.

54:57.020 --> 55:01.020
I don't know what's reasonable for the exponents A and B,

55:02.020 --> 55:06.020
or for these parameters R, M, G, and C.

55:06.020 --> 55:12.020
That's where we are with this.

55:12.020 --> 55:15.020
It's suggestive and I think interesting,

55:15.020 --> 55:19.020
and I think there would be an interesting outcome

55:19.020 --> 55:24.020
if one could really set this up realistically and solve for the optimum.

55:24.020 --> 55:28.020
My guess, of course, and I'm sure all of you would probably guess,

55:28.020 --> 55:34.020
that we're allocating way too little to education, environment, and health.

55:34.020 --> 55:38.020
But this would be a way to quantitatively demonstrate

55:38.020 --> 55:46.020
how much less are we allocating than we should if we want to maximize well-being.

55:46.020 --> 55:49.020
Here's where I really overreached.

55:49.020 --> 55:52.020
That was blue sky, and now we're even above the blue.

55:52.020 --> 55:54.020
There are no molecules up here.

55:54.020 --> 55:56.020
We're in the ionosphere.

55:56.020 --> 56:02.020
We don't normally think in terms of how some advantageous tax law

56:02.020 --> 56:07.020
or other social policy is selected for culturally.

56:07.020 --> 56:11.020
I suppose we think in terms of cultural selection,

56:11.020 --> 56:17.020
and we sort of follow the strategy I took with the plant microbe example.

56:18.020 --> 56:24.020
We could think about weakly interacting societies,

56:24.020 --> 56:30.020
which transfer goods, there's diffusion of resources,

56:30.020 --> 56:34.020
there's extirpation occasionally,

56:34.020 --> 56:43.020
and how will different strategies of economic allocation

56:43.020 --> 56:51.020
evolve under different scenarios for this spatially explicit world

56:51.020 --> 56:56.020
in which we have different experimental economies in different places?

56:56.020 --> 56:59.020
Would the outcome look optimal?

56:59.020 --> 57:06.020
I think if we could write down a model that looks like this toy model

57:06.020 --> 57:10.020
of competition and mutualism for the economy

57:10.020 --> 57:15.020
and do a spatially explicit grid type solution,

57:15.020 --> 57:20.020
we would find that some kind of optimal solution should evolve.

57:20.020 --> 57:23.020
I started thinking about this.

57:23.020 --> 57:26.020
The US became the dominant world power.

57:26.020 --> 57:35.020
We somehow maximized an awful lot of stuff between 1776 and 1900.

57:35.020 --> 57:38.020
How did we do it?

57:38.020 --> 57:42.020
Is there anything in here that helps us understand that?

57:42.020 --> 57:46.020
I was thinking, well, the Monroe Doctrine,

57:46.020 --> 57:48.020
that was a really neat thing in some ways.

57:48.020 --> 57:53.020
It also had some terrible implications for colonialism in South America,

57:53.020 --> 57:58.020
but as a global strategy of isolating us,

57:58.020 --> 58:01.020
at least to a great extent, not completely,

58:01.020 --> 58:06.020
but partially isolating us from the rest of the world,

58:06.020 --> 58:16.020
we allowed some kind of very successful economic allocation strategy to arise.

58:16.020 --> 58:20.020
I'm not saying it's one that maximized health or education or environment.

58:20.020 --> 58:21.020
It certainly didn't.

58:21.020 --> 58:28.020
But something got optimized as a result of the fact that we kept Europe at bay

58:28.020 --> 58:33.020
for decades and decades, for a century.

58:33.020 --> 58:39.020
So is there anything about the world today

58:39.020 --> 58:44.020
in which there's enormous amounts of diffusion, if you like,

58:44.020 --> 58:47.020
between cultures and countries?

58:47.020 --> 58:52.020
The world is so mixed that in such a situation,

58:52.020 --> 58:58.020
is it possible that strategic optimizing outcomes are not likely to occur?

58:58.020 --> 59:05.020
There's too much mixing, and we are, in a sense,

59:05.020 --> 59:12.020
going towards some suboptimal kind of culturally evolutionarily,

59:12.020 --> 59:14.020
cultural evolution outcome.

59:14.020 --> 59:15.020
I have no idea.

59:15.020 --> 59:20.020
I just find the speculation interesting, and I thought I'd share it with you.

59:20.020 --> 59:24.020
So that, I think, is the end of my talk.

59:24.020 --> 59:30.020
Yes.

59:30.020 --> 59:32.020
John, what about the gift economy?

59:32.020 --> 59:34.020
How does that fit into?

59:34.020 --> 59:36.020
Tell me more about the gift economy.

59:36.020 --> 59:44.020
The gift economy is really how you operate without the capital that we're used to operating with.

59:44.020 --> 59:50.020
We operate in, so you need, I'm growing a whole lot of corn,

59:50.020 --> 59:53.020
and you need some corn, and so you trade with me.

59:53.020 --> 59:57.020
And we have that kind of...

59:57.020 --> 01:00:04.020
Sam, you sort of talked about that a little bit in your science paper, didn't you?

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:09.020
Yeah, but a lot of the stuff in the science paper is exactly the same.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.020
Something at the end is not at all optimal.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:17.020
I'm glad to hear that.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:22.020
I think a really fascinating problem for you in the last couple of slides you're following.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:31.020
In Europe, in 1450, there were something like 450 sovereign states, or state bodies.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:36.020
I mean, some were run by pirates, and some were bishoprics, and so on, but they were sovereign, right?

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:41.020
And then, by the time of the First World War, that had been reduced to 26.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:47.020
And what had happened over that period of time was been a vast homogenization of what we observed.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.020
No more bishoprics, no more pirates running things.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:54.020
We had a single form of government, which was the national state.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:58.020
So that's exactly the process you're talking about.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:05.020
And of course, in that situation, extirpation is there, migration among states, and so on.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:14.020
So what you're talking about there has real impact in society that can be studied using the tools you have.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:23.020
Back to Bobby's question, what about pre-Columbus U.S. or North America?

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:34.020
Tribes of people with different gift economies, I think, would be the right use of your term.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:41.020
I mean, I can't study that. There's been a number of studies of group selection in New Guinea, which is easy to do.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:48.020
Things like, and you can put into models, different levels of food sharing in a society.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:59.020
You can just write down a whole bunch of equations, which are in different forms of something called reproductive leveling.

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:06.020
That is, anything which reduces the variance of reproductive success within a group has a huge effect on a soil.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:14.020
It gives much greater space for group selection because it takes the graph on the right that you showed where the good guys are going to lose,

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:21.020
just slows down that process. So there's a whole lot of ways that this can be interesting.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:29.020
And one more little fun fact, that production function that you listed there was invented by Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.020
I think I read that somewhere.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:36.020
He knew exactly, and he had exactly the intuition you did.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:42.020
And typically we say that A plus B is equal to one. That's called constant returns to scale.

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:47.020
Is that really required, constant returns to scale?

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.020
Yeah, it's always puzzled me why you sum them to one.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:59.020
Well, because that means the production function is homogeneous at degree one, which means if you expand all the inputs, you expand the output.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.020
There's no economies of scale.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.020
Just a mathematical convenience, and it's approximately correct in a lot of situations.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:11.020
I'm very sorry I have to run out of time. Are you going to be around to tea?

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.020
I'll be around all next week.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.020
But I won't.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.020
I'll be around this afternoon.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.020
Yeah, where's your office?

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.020
It's way down there.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.020
It's easy.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.020
I'm sorry, I've got to think.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:41.020
As soon as you came up with that final thing, and I was thinking, don't you feel that Joseph Tainter was basically trying to answer that with saying, yeah, when you get too much interactions and too much complexity built in as a…

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:54.020
But he was talking about interaction within the group, over-complexification of administration and overly…

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.020
In a sense, if we consider the group of planets.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:16.020
Yeah, in a way, if you did this as a model of what's the optimal complexity of a society, you might come up with a Tainter conclusion that too much, too little, no good in between an optimum.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.020
He often uses book scale in places like…

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.020
He used to come up with a scale, and you just mentioned…

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.020
He sort of says the scale is bigger and bigger and more efficient.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:27.020
I don't agree with that efficiency, but he calls it that.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020
I don't either.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:32.020
So he sort of says that means you're always going to go to bigger and bigger and bigger things.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.020
This is sort of an antidote, even if I accept that definition of efficiency.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.020
This is still like an antidote to that way of thinking.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:42.020
It's not that one homogenous group is the best way to go.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.020
That's right.

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.020
Exactly.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.020
Mimi.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.020
This may have been in your graphs, and they went by too fast for me.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.020
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:58.020
This may have been in your graphs, and they may have gone by too fast for me to pick up.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:12.020
But if the habitat is very poor in resources altogether, or very rich in resources altogether, does that affect either what the outcomes are or the rate at which they get there?

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.020
It's sort of cart before horse.

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:21.020
The model is telling us what it's predicting what the resources will be in each patch.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:32.020
If we think of the resources as the nutrient content of the soil, carbon, and nitrogen, that's an outcome of the model, not an input to it.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:38.020
But when you try to translate that to people, people living in the desert and people living in the forest, it's not like that.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:48.020
When it comes to people, definitely we would have to either do some weird averaging over the whole nation's resource.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:53.020
Just imagine lumping everything in the U.S. into a common resource.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:57.020
That would be the ultimate in spherical cow modeling.

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:07.020
And that's how my instinct would be to do that first, then put in the complexity of people who live with bad soil, people who live with good soil.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:15.020
On the trekker board, each patch was as good as enough.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:24.020
Well, it starts out uniform, but it doesn't end up uniform because the model creates different levels of nitrogen in the different cells.

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:33.020
So you create heterogeneity, biologically, rather than impose it as a rigid constraint.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:42.020
Thanks.

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:46.020
We'll see you guys 6.30, right? Yeah, good.
