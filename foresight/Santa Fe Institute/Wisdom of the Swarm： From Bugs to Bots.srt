1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
at Cambridge University and he's been a professor of physics at Harvard University for the past

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,240
20 plus years I guess. Two facts about him that you might not know or maybe you do know is one

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,320
of MacArthur, genius of course, 1009. And the other thing is that he's also recipient of the

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:30,960
Ike Bilbell Prize in 2007 and what he wanted for was understanding wrinkly of sheets and manifolds

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,720
when they land on surfaces so every time I look in the mirror I'll keep the view.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,680
That's pretty cool. I hope everybody else does the same from now on. Okay, thank you Sid.

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,360
It's a very small group so I hope that you will make this more of a multi-log and just

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,920
interrupt me as you feel the need to and correct me which I'm sure you will. So I wanted to tell

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,640
you something about some problems that I've been working on for more than a decade. All inspired

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:14,400
by originally Edward Lear and the wonderful poetry that he wrote in the 19th century associated

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,200
with collective nouns for groups of animals. So I'm going to show you one and I'm going to ask

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:30,080
you a question. So these are starlings from a BBC documentary above Rome so probably everybody

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,320
over here does know what the collective noun for starlings is. Memorization. What is it for rhinos?

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,680
A crash. What is it for owls? Parliament. Yeah, so I think what is it for?

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm going to say, well, no, I'm not going to go, never mind. So the point about these

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,160
collectives is that it says something about function and that's very important and that's

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,400
what I want to try and emphasize over the next hour or so that even though from the

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,280
perspective that certainly I'm going to tell you a little bit about from physics, from mathematics,

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,160
you can ask about what kinds of and what forms of order do you see in collectives of organisms

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:35,600
on any scale from microbes to robots. But as the language, as English actually has got so many,

21
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,840
and I'm sure this is true of every language, has got so many different forms for collectives

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,960
different depending on the organism, it's associated with function. So why do these

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,280
collectives exist? Presumably they're associated with every collective there's a function. And

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
also from a physics point of view, you can ask a mathematics point of view, you can ask how do

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,080
they form. So there are three kinds of questions that you can ask about any kinds of collective

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,000
behavior in particular associated with collections of animals. And what I'd like to do is to ask

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,800
two different types of questions associated with collective behavior. One is how is collective

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,920
behavior constrained by physics. And the other is how does physics enable function in the context

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,760
of collective behavior. And I think it's interesting to point out a framework for this which has been

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,640
laid out a long time ago outside of physics by Nicholas Tinbergen, one of two brothers, both

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,720
of whom got the Nobel Prize. Tinbergen got the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine and he shared

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,800
it with Conrad Lorenz and Frisch in 1967 and 1968. And he raised a set of questions which have formed

33
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,080
the bedrock of ethology in studying behavior in animals. He was originally thinking about single

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,320
animals, individuals, but we can ask the same question in the context of collective. So he asked,

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,760
you know, what is a behavior in terms of its function? So, you know, how can you describe

36
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,640
that function? Why does that function arise? How does that function come to be in the context

37
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,680
of causation? And then both a proximal and a distal perspective in an organism, how does that

38
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,400
behavior develop? And how does it essentially arise across different species in an evolutionary

39
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,080
setting? But you don't have to limit yourself to organisms. You can of course ask the same

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,800
question in the context of collections of organisms. And what I want to do is to make this

41
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
very specific because I'm thinking about function in the context of architectures

42
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,040
because they are very concrete, quite literally often in, for example, with the human

43
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,000
situation. But in the animal situation, you also have remarkable sets of architectures which are

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,880
formed from the scale of microbes. We can essentially create biofilms to ants, to bees. I'm going to

45
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,760
focus on social insects, to termites. And I've shown you three different scales. Each one of them

46
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,720
has organisms on the scale of hundreds, two thousands or even millions. In this case associated

47
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
with maximizing transport from one location on a tree to another. In this case, which I'll come

48
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,920
back to associated with understanding how to minimize heating and cooling conditions within

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,680
the inside and or mechanically being stable when responding to a wind. And in this case,

50
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,960
a combination of making sure that you are simultaneously not fully insulated from the

51
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,360
environment, but not fully porous to the environment so that the vagaries and the fluctuations

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,480
associated with the environment can be buffered to some extent by architectures.

53
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,840
So these functional collectives in general, lots of work has been gone on from a biological

54
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,640
perspective, tend to roughly be capable of being broken up into ways of controlling how

55
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
in a physical context, energy matter information can be transferred with an uncertain environment.

56
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,480
And that environment and the ways in which the collectives form are or have to be adaptable in

57
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,240
a way which I'll become, which has become clearer and also are spatially heterogeneous. So they're

58
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,760
not just temporal, but also complex spatial patterns that form. And moving away from our

59
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,000
perspective and thinking about energy matter information, if I'm thinking about these systems

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,200
in a biological context, we have to start thinking about how you can or not get coordination and

61
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,760
communication in the context of these functional self-organized patterns. And an important thing

62
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,360
that I think I don't have to convince anybody over here, but worth pointing out right at the

63
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,400
beginning is in none of these cases, is there any evidence of a plan or a planner? There is

64
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
some sensing, there is some action at the individual level, which gradually

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
transcends the individual and at the collective level leads to these functional patterns.

66
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,200
And the most important part is that you can't leave out the environment. And that's what I'm

67
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,320
going to talk about in three different examples. So you have to think about the organism, you've

68
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,680
got to think about the organism interacting with other conspecifics, and then eventually you've

69
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,280
got to think about how it interacts with the environment. It changes the environment and

70
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,040
is changed by the environment. And you have to see these three examples, we immediately see that,

71
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,640
to understand that. Okay, so as I said, typical kind of question that we can ask is both ways,

72
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,720
how does collective behavior enabled and how does collective behavior constrained by physics?

73
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,320
Okay, I want to talk about social insects

74
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,280
for a reason which I don't think again is necessary for me to elaborate too much,

75
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,920
primarily because you have a remarkable, so these are the big four classes of social insects,

76
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,480
these wasps, ants, and termites. But from the point of view of the perspective that I came

77
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,840
to this from, I started out thinking about morphogenesis and thinking about multicellular

78
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,760
organisms. And there are lots of parallels between multicellular organisms and super

79
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,400
organisms, where these super organisms have a separation between the germline and the soma,

80
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,280
just like in multicellular organisms as well. Here you have often usually a queen,

81
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,800
and that's the only organism in colony that's capable of reproductive behavior. But then

82
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:09,440
everything else is shared, you have common nests, they are unlike in us, social insects are clonal,

83
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
you have reproductive mission of labor, as I said before, you have cooperative brood care,

84
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,320
you have overlapping generations, and the consequence of the last two is that you have

85
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,240
a sense of culture, and that culture is transmitted not through genetics, but through other means.

86
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,840
Okay, as a consequence of having these very large collections of organisms, you find that

87
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,160
they are extraordinary problem solvers. They can solve problems in physiology that are impossible

88
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,640
to solve on the scale of an individual organism, but can be solved collectively on the scale of

89
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,360
hundreds to millions of organisms. And as I said, I want to tell you about architectures,

90
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,000
and architectures are wonderful because you can essentially figure out a way to connect physiology

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,160
to physics, in this case the physiology is the architecture which is living, but not necessarily

92
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,920
made only of living things. It's essentially the environment which is dynamically changing,

93
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,480
and I'm going to show you examples of how these architectures allow for respiration and ventilation

94
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,720
on scales much larger than organisms in the context of bees, thermoregulation also in the

95
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,400
context of bees, and mechanoregulation in the context of termites and bees.

96
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,560
I've said this before, I want to emphasize this again. We should be thinking about the fact that

97
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,720
in all these examples that I'll tell you about, the environment is a malleable substrate, so it

98
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,240
can be changed by the organism, and a consequence of that is it changes the behavior of the organism,

99
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,680
and so the environment serves as a slow communication channel. The dynamics of the

100
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
environment is slow, typically compared to the dynamics of the organism,

101
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
modulo being close to where we are in the context of climate change and tipping points and what

102
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
not, but in general you have a separation of timescales associated with these things.

103
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,480
Okay, so the three examples that I want to tell you about which involve

104
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,720
connecting experiment and theory in very different places, and very different times over the last

105
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,880
decade. First example that I want to tell you about is associated with termite mounds. This

106
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,920
is an image of a termite mound from here, from Bangalore. We started out doing experiments over

107
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,200
here and then in Namibia and then parts of Western Africa. This is an image of a termite mound during

108
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,560
the day. This is an image of the termite mound at night viewed through an infrared camera superposed

109
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,880
on a regular image, and what you can see is essentially changes in temperature, so this

110
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,160
part is at night warm and cold, depending on time of the day or time of the night. Now I'll

111
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,880
come back to this, and this is work that was done with Sam Oko, who was a PhD student, and Alex

112
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
Hyde, also a PhD student, and I'll come back to that. So what are the questions over here? The

113
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,360
questions are what is the structure for, how is it built, and how does this all work out in the

114
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,200
context of a larger ecological question of the environment? This is a termite mound.

115
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,320
Oh, what? I'm going to show you all this. I'm going to tell you about the anatomy,

116
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,160
I'm going to tell you about the physiology, so hold the question. And please do stop me

117
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,440
with questions at any point. Some of them I will answer immediately, but some,

118
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
if you don't mind, I'll wait because I will have something to say about that.

119
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,080
The second problem that I want to tell you about was done in collaboration with Orif Pelleg, who I

120
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,040
know is an external faculty member over here. She started this when she was a postdoc. Now she's

121
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,480
in Colorado, and Jake Peters was a graduate student, and this is understanding ventilation, but not

122
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,480
for termite mounds, ventilation in bee hives or bee boxes, and this was done not so far from Boston

123
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,480
in our Concord Field Station. And then if I have time, I'll tell you about a third problem where

124
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,400
we essentially brought everything into the lab. Initially we wanted to do this, but we haven't

125
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,640
been able to. The third problem is associated with the third class of social insects. We haven't

126
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,040
had a chance to work on wasps yet. I would love to find a way to do so. And the third problem is

127
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,600
associated with understanding how architectures can be broken and built in the context of ants,

128
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,000
which want to try and escape from a coral in which they are essentially initially placed.

129
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,800
And then I want to gradually move from thinking about ants to robotic mimics of this. And the

130
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,520
question over there is what are the necessary, what is the minimum necessary set of rules,

131
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,760
and what is the minimum sufficient set of rules associated with having a programmable set of

132
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
agents that can interact with each other and interact with an environment to be able to capture

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,320
some aspects of the dynamics of organisms interacting with each other and with an environment,

134
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,840
all of which are malleable. And this is work that continues, actually. It started out with

135
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:28,080
Ganga Prasad and Sovik Mandal. Fabio built robots, and this was all a very close collaboration with

136
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,040
a colleague of mine in biology, Venkimofi, who was very interested in collectively.

137
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,800
Okay. So I'll give you the final result or way to think about, at least the way I've

138
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,360
approached this problem. And then you can come back to the talk periodically. If you feel like

139
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,040
a, every one of these I claim, and I'll show you evidence for, even though the problems that are

140
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,600
solved on much larger scales associated with very simple local sensing rules and local actuation

141
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,880
rules. And the key ingredient that I would like to emphasize is global physics, physics associated

142
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,520
with how heat is moving around, how vibrations are moving around, how fluid dynamics plays a role,

143
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,920
and coupled with simple local sensing and local actuation rules and global physics,

144
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,080
you can get both function and architecture as the claim. And I want to essentially tell you how

145
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,720
we think about this in all these problems. Okay. So termite mounds are remarkable. They are an

146
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,160
ecosystem on their own. You can actually have collections of collections, if you want. These

147
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,520
are collections of termite mounds from Australia. They're called magnetic termite mounds, wall

148
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,600
termite mounds, which seem to be oriented roughly in a particular angle with respect to magnetic

149
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,320
knots. So each mound can have millions of individuals. A termite itself is the size of a

150
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,200
fingernail. And you find them everywhere except in Antarctica. Probably the most remarkable example

151
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:02,400
of recent work in this space. This is England, Great Britain. This is the coast of South America.

152
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,480
This is a set of termite mounds which was excavated five or six years ago.

153
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,920
Look at the scale. It is not one mound. There are many mounds. A whole bunch of them.

154
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,280
Hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. So they essentially have the capacity to completely

155
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,080
change the ecology of the environment in which they are. So you can ask questions on the very,

156
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,160
very large scale. You can ask questions on the intermediate scale or on the very small scale.

157
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,880
And I'll talk about the intermediate and the small scale. What happens on the scale of an

158
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,920
individual termite mound when I coarse-grain and look at it? What happens at the level of

159
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,160
termites interacting with each other and with the termite mound as they build it? Those are the

160
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,120
two scales in which I want to tell you about. I won't tell you anything about on the very large

161
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,640
scale. So answering Sid's question, we started out, as I said, working on it in India with a

162
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,920
particular species, Odontoktermis obesis. You know, a few millimeters in size. Termite mounds are

163
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,200
hollow, but they are hollow on different scales. You don't have a chimney at the top,

164
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,040
contrary to what sometimes is shown in children's books. This is a view from the top. You don't

165
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,200
also have to have this very fluted structure. So for example, this is one from Namibia.

166
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,760
It's more or less axi-symmetric. Certainly it doesn't have flutes. These ones are not.

167
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,000
Under what conditions do you get it? Under what conditions you don't? I don't really have a sense

168
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,360
of that. The ecologists and the natural historians haven't actually really, I think, quantified

169
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,520
where and when you get this. So it's porous on multiple scales, and you can ask many questions.

170
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,800
You know, what is this good for from a physiology point of view? How might it be built from a

171
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
morphogenesis point of view? And what are the effects on ecology? And this is the question

172
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,880
that I will not answer. I'll try and answer some of these two. Okay, so start with anatomy. So this

173
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,520
is the anatomy of a termite mound. The most interesting part of the mound is not what you see

174
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,200
above. It's below. It's what's called the gallery. And within this gallery is where the brood is,

175
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,680
where most of the termites are most of the time. And along with the brood and the termites,

176
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,680
you also have fungus. Essentially, the termites will bring water and fungi from their environment

177
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,560
in the neighborhood of an individual mound, and they will use this to feed the brood and keep

178
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:17,200
the entire environment moist. The gallery itself, you can't, of course, see until it erupts into

179
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,480
a mound. So there's a very difficult question over here, which nobody's really addressed,

180
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,800
which is on what are the conditions for the eruption of a mound? And nobody's been able

181
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,360
to really build a mound in the lab. There are some attempts partially successful.

182
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,400
Continuing to answer the questions that you raised, a collaborator of mine, I'm sorry,

183
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:41,200
his name is not here, Rupert Soar basically took a mound, which we knew was not inhabited anymore.

184
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,480
And how do we know this? We know this by essentially looking to see whether it starts to degrade over

185
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
a period of time. And if there is no repair, then you know it very likely it's been abandoned.

186
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,720
You can pour gypsum into it, allow that to precipitate. And then you can wash out the mud.

187
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,720
And this is the negative image of a termite mound. So you have vast, almost vertical channels,

188
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,520
which are themselves connected to each other. The termite mound is micro porous on the outside.

189
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,760
And as you go further and further inside, it becomes more and more macro porous. So the porosity

190
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,040
is got a gradient, small, many pores on the outside. As you go deeper and deeper, the pores

191
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,800
become larger and larger. And you have essentially vertical channels. And of course, this would

192
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,400
suggest that it has a very important part in ventilation. I'll show you some images associated

193
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,440
with that. So what is the physiology of this? Best way to describe this is to ask my favorite

194
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,880
naturalist and probably everybody's. Here in South Africa, it can also get very hot,

195
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,040
but there's no danger of flooding. So termites can take refuge from the heat below ground,

196
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:55,920
where it's cool and relatively stable. But two million insects living below ground

197
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:03,360
create a different kind of problem. The air around them gets stale. So termites need to have a way

198
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,760
of linking the underground air with the fresh air above a ventilation system. And they do that

199
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,720
with this. And to see how it works, you've got to look inside.

200
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,040
Using the latest scanning techniques, we can create a picture of the mound's interior.

201
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
An intricate network of passages lead to a central chimney.

202
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,840
Hot stale air from the insect population below rises up through the chimney.

203
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:50,240
But the top of the mound is sealed. So how does this stale air escape? The mound may look as though

204
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,080
it has strong defensive walls like a fortress. But in fact, these walls are porous, and their

205
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,800
primary purpose is to harness the wind. Fresh air blowing against the side of the mound

206
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,880
is forced through the tiny holes in these walls. From there, it travels through the smaller tunnels

207
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:17,440
until it reaches the central chimney. Here, the cooler fresh air mixes with the hot stale air

208
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,480
rising from the insect community below. Meanwhile, some air is blown around the side of the mound.

209
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,520
This creates a suction that pulls the stale air out of the chimney and out through the outer walls.

210
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,880
So an internal air current is created and the whole mound ventilated.

211
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,200
The mound's inhabitants spend most of their time close to or below ground level.

212
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,800
So he said, to De Bilan Mero said two things. First, he said that you have to have transport

213
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,200
across the wall, which is porous, which of course makes a lot of sense. But in fact,

214
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,040
as you know, because the pores are small, hydrodynamic effects are all going to be

215
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,800
dominated by viscous forces. They're not going to be dominated by inertia. And he then said something

216
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,840
else, which should have gotten all your antlers or your antenna up. And he said something about the

217
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,800
fact that, oh, if I have air moving around it, then the velocity of the air is high,

218
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,160
the pressure is low, and it's going to be suction. That can't be correct. And you can do an estimate

219
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:22,720
of that. And so clearly, if you have porosity, part of the argument associated with transport,

220
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,960
because of differences in concentration, is correct. But the airflow argument associated with

221
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,480
Bernoulli is wrong. And so this is the kind of argument which has been around in the literature

222
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,320
for a while. And we decided we'd go and measure things. We went to Namibia and we measured. What

223
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,280
did we measure? So you can measure the fluid flow velocities outside. You can essentially drill

224
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,720
holes into the termite mounds. And you can put in temperature sensors. And you can also have

225
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,760
velocity sensors to measure. I want to emphasize velocity sensors, not just speed, but direction

226
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,360
of the motion of the air inside. And then you can ask whether this is correct or not. And I'm going

227
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,960
to summarize the story, because it's almost a decade old now. And the story is that the argument

228
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,240
that Attenborough put forward is only partly correct. An important part was missed. And what

229
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,840
is the important part that was missed? In fact, let me show you an image. And then I'm going to

230
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,360
walk you through the argument. You know, our measurements and so on are there in this paper,

231
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,840
which is, as I said, published almost a decade ago. I showed you this image in the beginning.

232
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,520
This is a termite mound using regular light. This is an infrared during the day. And this is at

233
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,360
night. And so what really happens is the following. The mound is heated during the day and it cools

234
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,560
at night. But because the mound has a large thermal mass and therefore a thermal inertia,

235
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,720
the entire mound can't be heated simultaneously. It has to be heated from the outside and gradually

236
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,600
moves inwards. And so there's going to be a lag. If my thermal inertia is large enough,

237
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,040
then the outside is warm during the day, the inside is cold, hasn't had chance to heat up,

238
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,480
and exactly the reverse at night, because the inside is starting to warm up

239
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,560
during the day, outside starts to cool quickly. That means you have thermal gradients.

240
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,280
And these thermal gradients in space are a function of temperature variations in time.

241
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,840
So in fact, the termite mound actually is a heat engine, which instead of working between two,

242
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,560
a source and a sink in temperature, as we are used to thinking in thermodynamics,

243
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,600
which are kept at constant temperature, now in fact, the source and sink are oscillating.

244
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,920
And the mound is harnessing this temperature variation in time to create spatial flows

245
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,280
inside the mound, which we measure. So during the day, the outside of the mound is hot,

246
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,040
the air right inside is warm. As a consequence, air is going to rise. But because the air can't

247
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,840
leave because of the microporosity, so during the day, you have cycles like this, which we measure.

248
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,400
And at night, the outside starts to cool, so the mound air, sorry, the air in the mound just

249
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,640
inside starts to cool, it starts to sink, and the whole thing reverses. And so when will this

250
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
happen? It's not going to happen continuously, it's going to happen at dusk and a dawn, or slightly

251
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,560
after dusk and slightly before dawn, which means that the mound is a lung, and it's a lung driven

252
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:11,760
by temperature variations. And the mound essentially breathes twice a day. In us, our lungs work

253
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,280
primarily because of our diaphragm. Our diaphragm is essentially fundamentally what is essentially

254
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,680
pushing and pulling air in and out of the lungs. And instead of the diaphragm providing the muscular

255
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,320
forces in us, over here, temperature variations are essentially giving rise to the same thing.

256
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,600
And so we measured this in dead mounds. To be sure that we were right, we said, ah, in a live

257
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,800
mound, if this is the same thing, if this is happening in a live mound, which we know is live,

258
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,440
as I said, because it's under construction, we can see termites. In a dead mound, we see exactly

259
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,080
the same thing. Both in a live and a dead mound, we see the same thing. And we did this with two

260
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,200
different species on two different continents. We did this in Africa, in Namibia. We did this

261
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:54,960
in India with a different species. In Africa, in the temperate region, temperature variations are

262
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,840
much larger. And I'm going to come back to this. So therefore, you have much larger variations

263
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,440
to temperature between day and night. The consequence of that is the velocity should be much

264
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,040
larger. In India, the temperature variations are much smaller. The velocity should be smaller.

265
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,800
All that checks out. And the idea that it works like a lung, here is the evidence for this.

266
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,520
So what I'm showing you over here is what's happening in the nest and the gallery and what's

267
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,800
happening in the chimney. The carbon dioxide concentration starts to go up during the day,

268
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,080
as the termites are physiologically active. And then when at about 6 or 7 p.m., when this entire

269
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,320
cycle reverses, instead of having flows like this, the flows reverse, you excavate the bottom,

270
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,000
you excavate the gallery. And when you excavate the gallery, the carbon dioxide comes up. And

271
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,520
when the carbon dioxide comes up, the concentration of carbon dioxide inside is high compared to

272
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,240
outside. Now the porosity kicks in because the concentration difference allows you to

273
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,080
essentially equilibrate. So you have large-scale flows coupled to small-scale diffusion,

274
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,240
all driven by a heat source and a heat sink, which are fluctuating. So this is an interesting

275
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,680
observation, if only because it suggests that unlike our heat engines, animals don't have to work

276
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,360
at constant source and constant sink temperatures, you can have fluctuating versions of this.

277
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Okay, so I'll leave it at that. A second question that this raises is when I said, ah,

278
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,800
the thermal inertia is large, if the thermal inertia was not large, of course, temperatures

279
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,920
will equilibrate quickly. And if temperature equilibrate quickly, you don't have to have any

280
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,040
of this. And so that begs the question, how in the world do termites figure out how to

281
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,400
build a structure of this kind so that it actually works? And I want to introduce another

282
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,120
naturalist, evolutionary biologist, who basically poses the question and then I'll show you

283
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,280
an attempt at an answer. Okay. Now what's fascinating to me about this is that if you came

284
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:54,720
across a building like that, you'd assume that some architect had designed it and he'd had a blueprint

285
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,240
of some kind, right, the drawing of how it was going to go, and he told people exactly what to do.

286
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,160
Now, this termite mine, nobody had an image of the complete building. I mean, no termite has a

287
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,160
picture of the whole mound. All the termites do is they, they build a mound and they're following

288
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:19,280
some rules. And to be honest, I don't think we know exactly what those rules are. My guess is that

289
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,920
they're fairly, fairly simple. So he gives it at that. What are they doing? What are they doing?

290
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,320
Fairly simple. So he gives it at that. What are the rules? How can we essentially now connect

291
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,200
the building behavior to the environmental changes? Because the building behavior will

292
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,120
change the environment. The environment will then feed back and change the behavior. For

293
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,360
example, if I build a mound, there are only certain places that the termites can get to.

294
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,160
So can we now understand how to couple the physics of the environment to the behavioral

295
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,280
biology of the organism? So don't separate out, this part is living and this part is not living.

296
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,520
So here's a cartoon. And here's a phrase which essentially summarizes everything.

297
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,480
You know, so Churchill famously said, we shape our buildings after they shape us. Well,

298
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,520
in the context of termites, the mound morphology clearly will influence the airflow. I've already

299
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,600
shown you, at least I wave my hands and told you how it works. We have some measurements of that.

300
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,200
The airflow is going to change the olfactory currents. It's going to change the pheromone

301
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,680
concentrations. The pheromone concentrations are going to change the termite behavior. And the termite

302
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,640
behavior is going to change the mind morphology. So you can't anymore separate out the organism

303
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,320
from the environment just as we can't separate out the brain from the body. We have to think

304
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,400
about all these things together. So how do we unpack this? And I'll show you two ways of unpacking

305
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,360
this. First is understanding the coarse-grained morphology of the termite mound. And second,

306
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,440
I'm going to show you CAT scans of the mound itself. And then I'm going to see how to unpack

307
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,280
the fine-grained morphology. First thing that you notice is that termite mounds are conical.

308
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,800
The aspect ratio is, they're not spheres. In fact, I'm going to show you examples.

309
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,680
Termite mounds, which you see in environments which are shady or termite mounds on trees,

310
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,240
they're much closer to spherical. So first question is, how come they become tall? And

311
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,360
I don't have to, I think, explain to this audience that one way to break symmetry is to use buoyancy.

312
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,480
Because as soon as I heat the air, heat air is going to move up and down much faster than sideways.

313
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,880
And if I essentially have buoyancy, that means I can move pheromones much faster in one direction

314
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,360
compared to the other. That means, therefore, I'll be able to build more in one direction compared

315
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,200
to the other if the pheromones were essentially responsible for the behavior of the termite.

316
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,240
And as a consequence, and I'll show you some scaling laws for that in just a minute,

317
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,880
as a consequence, you would expect that as you move from environments where the temperature

318
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
variations are small to environment where temperature variations are large,

319
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,920
the mound should become larger. This has been known for 100 years. If you go to the savanna,

320
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,560
you go to parts of southern Africa, you go to the temperate zones, the mounds can be 3,

321
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,960
3.5, 4 meters. You go to India, they are smaller. You go to a tree, they're even smaller. So already

322
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,280
you say, ah, that the physics of the environment is playing a very important role. Can I essentially

323
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:14,160
unpack that? So here is an attempt to do that. I've already, this is a cartoon. I'm going to assume

324
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,480
axi-symmetry. You have all kinds of interesting questions associated with how you break axi-symmetry.

325
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,480
We haven't addressed them. This is what I told you a minute or two ago that associated with

326
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,920
diurnal variations in temperature. You have heat and therefore air moving around. That means

327
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,760
pheromones are moving around. And the simplest rule for biology, for behavior, is you build if

328
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,600
the concentration of pheromones increases past the critical value, you stop and then you allow

329
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,760
things to degrade if the pheromone concentration does not. That's it. That's the only place

330
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,480
where I introduce a behavioral rule. Minimally, I have to therefore couple three different fields.

331
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,000
Temperature, which is the driving source of all that's happening. It's a function nominally of

332
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,920
time, but it becomes a function of space, s and z, z and s in the radial direction because I'm

333
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:13,040
thinking about a conducting porous material, a velocity which is driven by temperature variations

334
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,480
because of buoyancy and then pheromone concentration because they're essentially moved around. So

335
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,760
minimally, we have to have these three fields and forget the equations. I'll just describe what they

336
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,840
mean, which I think is very intuitive. Dienal oscillation would change in time with a frequency

337
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,920
which is one over 24 hours. Heat flow, so temperature variations are driven by advection

338
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,880
because of the fluid flow and they also have diffusion. Fluid flow, this is a porous medium,

339
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,640
it's driven essentially by temperature variations. Temperature variations lead to buoyancy and the

340
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,640
fluid is assumed to be incompressible. And the pheromone is advected by the fluid, it diffuses

341
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,480
and it has a source. And the source of all the pheromones are in the gallery because that's

342
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,440
where most of the termites are most of the time. Those are my equations. Here is the only place

343
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,120
where the biology quote comes in. You build, if the pheromone concentration becomes large,

344
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,200
then large in a critical value, you stop building or you essentially let it degrade and that's

345
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:13,520
coming in otherwise. That's it. What are the parameters? So there is a thickness of the wall,

346
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,440
which is where you have microporosity, after which you have this microporosity. There's a

347
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,080
thermal diffusion length, which is essentially associated with how much of the mound you can

348
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,800
heat or cool during the day or night. There is a buoyancy parameter, which is telling you

349
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,600
as a function of the temperature variations how fast or how slow is the fluid flow moving up and

350
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,600
down. And there is a pheromone penetration depth. And that is the idea that if I have a source of

351
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,720
pheromones and I just uniformly allow them to diffuse, there comes a critical distance beyond

352
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,400
which the concentration has fallen down below critical value. And if it's fallen down below

353
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,320
critical value, you won't build larger than that. And if there was no temperature variation,

354
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,760
or sorry, if there was no buoyancy, then this would be isotropic, so you get a spherical

355
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,480
termite mound. The reason that you get an elongated mound is precisely and only because

356
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,480
the termites are harnessing the buoyancy without even thinking about it, to have pheromones move

357
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,040
much faster in the vertical direction because of buoyancy and only slowly diffuse in the horizontal

358
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:18,160
direction. So you're assuming that the pheromones would produce their constant rate.

359
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,440
That anything beyond that will essentially make the problem more complicated. But yes,

360
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,000
in the simplest setting, I'm assuming that there is a source of pheromones that's uniform and at

361
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
one location. You can start making all kinds of complexities beyond that. Yes, indeed.

362
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Yeah.

363
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,800
Which is known? Yes.

364
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,320
No, most over there, they're mostly excavating. All the building is happening above. So in the

365
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,160
gallery, there's a lot of porosity. Okay. Okay. So, but that's where the brood is,

366
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,080
and the brood are metabolically very active. So there's a huge source of pheromones and humidity,

367
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,080
water vapor, consequence of respiration, right there. But I don't know what was the...

368
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,440
There's a motion assumption here that I don't know. So you're assuming something about the

369
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,480
distribution of termites across the structure, and that's not... It's not here because I've

370
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,440
zoomed out and I'm thinking about not the individual dynamics of the termites. I'll come

371
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,840
back to that when I think about a second level of a model, which is more fine-grained. Here,

372
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm saying I'm thinking about the termite mount as it's being built over an entire season.

373
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,600
So you're assuming that they're somehow uniformly spread over the structure?

374
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,680
I am assuming nothing about them except the fact that the order production is happening

375
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:53,360
at a particular location with a particular rate. Right. Okay. If the termites were actually moving

376
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,120
around and depositing it, if you hold on, I will show you a more fine-grained model,

377
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,640
which asks, what is the fine-grained structure? And I think part of the message,

378
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,760
perhaps, which I should have said, and maybe I'll say now, is I'm going to build a sequence of models,

379
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,400
actually in this case, two models. One for the coarse-grained perspective to understand

380
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,960
the aspect ratio and the size of the mount. Another one for the fine-grained structure,

381
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,680
because I'm going to show you with CAT scans that, in fact, the mount has a layered,

382
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,160
smectic-like behavior, smectic-like structure, you know, like a parking garage. And in order

383
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,720
to understand that, I'll have to start worrying about the dynamics of termites which are loaded

384
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,360
with cement, termites which are essentially unloaded and moving around, and how the air

385
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,000
is moving through all that I will build in at a more fine-grained level, if you will,

386
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,440
just wait for a couple of minutes. Question. More questions. Yeah.

387
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,720
So you said, you know, this still holds in the gallery. In the gallery, they're always active

388
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,080
because of the concentration of pheromones. In this case, I'm assuming that the gallery

389
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,160
is where most of the pheromones are produced. There could be pheromones produced elsewhere,

390
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,120
but I'm assuming that the concentration of pheromones elsewhere is a consequence of

391
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,600
being produced in large amounts at the base, and then moving around because of either diffusion

392
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,880
or buoyancy. I guess it's just for my mental picture. Is the gallery always increasing in size?

393
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:20,000
No, no, no. The gallery is first built, reaches a critical size. I don't know. We don't know what

394
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the critical size is. And then, and only then, does the mound start to erupt outwards. Upwards,

395
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,440
sorry. Okay. So I've told you the parameters. There are three-dimensionalist parameters from

396
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,760
these four scales. There are two scaling laws, which I'm going to tell you about, which we can

397
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,160
calculate as consequences of these equations, but I could just directly read off once I know

398
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,280
what the parameters are. One is the aspect ratio. What is the height compared to the radius?

399
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,960
And the most important thing is its non-unity, and the reason it's non-unity is because of the

400
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,520
presence of this quantity, which I'm going to call a Peclet number. It's related to things

401
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,760
that have dynamics associated with how diffusion and advection play off against each other.

402
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,360
And what is this saying? This Peclet number is a ratio of this quantity

403
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,120
to this quantity, a pheromone penetration to buoyancy. So what is that really saying? That means

404
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,440
if the Peclet number is small, it's dominated by diffusion, therefore it's going to remain spherical.

405
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,280
If the Peclet number is large, that means the buoyancy length is large, which means you have

406
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,600
very, very large flows in the vertical direction, which means that the aspect ratio becomes very,

407
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,960
very large. Okay. And the reason it's a square, you must expect it should go at least as a square,

408
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,720
is because the symmetry doesn't matter which way it's going, whether it's up or down. So you could

409
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,320
have just guessed that, but in fact, you can calculate it and you can do the numerics solving

410
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,640
these PDEs and you find that that's correct. And there is another lens at timescale and the

411
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,160
timescale is associated with how long does it take to reach steady state. Why will it reach a

412
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,000
steady state? And this is a non-equilibrium steady state. It reaches a steady state because

413
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
eventually the pheromone concentration on the walls reaches phi star. And once it reaches

414
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,480
phi star, it can't grow anymore outwards. And similarly, once you reach steady velocity,

415
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,760
it can't grow to large in a critical height. And that characteristic time, not surprisingly,

416
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,360
is related to, I'm going to call this the BI, the BO number, which for all kinds of

417
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,680
historical reasons is named for the scientist BO, and it's characterized by this thermal diffusion

418
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,200
lens. So how much does that heat penetrate in or out of this? And you can calculate solutions,

419
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,640
which I'm going to show you when here are solutions of the PDEs, which show you different

420
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,800
kinds of mounds. And you can qualitatively, but only qualitatively see that they don't

421
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:43,440
have a complete discordance with observations. I mean, I can't say that they capture all of it,

422
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,160
but qualitatively they're correct. But question. Sorry, on that. So if the population were growing.

423
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,240
Very good. Yeah, ask the question. Well, that final inequality then would not be here.

424
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,560
Indeed. And if the populations are growing, termite mound will continuously grow. And so now,

425
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,200
and this is where you get a second mound, which starts to come up. Because what happens is there

426
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,120
are two possibilities. One is just you grow this individual mound, but then that means you're

427
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,200
depleting resources from the immediate neighborhood. You're depleting water, you're depleting fungus,

428
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,120
and so there is a characteristic scale beyond which it's no longer efficient to keep growing

429
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,240
this one mound. Instead, you'll find a second mound that grows. And in fact, I should say, so

430
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:31,120
we worked in Namibia for two seasons. And in India for three seasons. What we found is that

431
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:36,560
mounds will be built in a period of three to four months. In India, the monsoon essentially washes

432
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:44,640
out almost everything in Namibia. We found often that grazing animals use this as a backscratcher,

433
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,840
and they will destroy it. But in either case, rarely do you have a mound which will essentially

434
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,600
persist over, for example, we came back after a year, and most of the mounds we were studying were

435
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:59,040
gone. So there are much more sophisticated analysis associated with the timescale over

436
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,320
which you would expect this to stay. I don't really know. I don't have anything to say.

437
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,200
But I do want to now zoom in. You can see I hope these mounds, these are cross sections of mounds,

438
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,080
and you see the mounds are actually layered structures. And I want to now tell you a little

439
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:25,360
bit about them. So not the macromorphogenesis, but the macromorphogenesis zooming in. And here's

440
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,880
an image from our collaborator, Geethe Rallos, who studies collective behavior in Toulouse,

441
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,800
took one of the West African mounds. This is a much smaller one. Look at the size over here. These

442
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,520
are small of the order of something that you can hold in your hand. And you see this beautiful

443
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,360
smectic structure. In fact, if you, you know, like love these kind of ordered structures,

444
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,920
and familiar with liquid crystals, for example, where you have nematics, smectics,

445
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,360
smectics A, smectics C, and then you have cholesterics and all, and like a discoid liquid

446
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,600
crystals and polarized liquid crystals and whatnot, you know that you get defects,

447
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,120
edge dislocations, screw dislocations, so you see all these structures. But very importantly,

448
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,800
unlike in liquid crystals, where those are consequences of a very racial principle associated

449
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,280
with minimizing energy, here these are arising from non-equilibrium considerations. There's nothing

450
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,000
about the system, which is at equilibrium. And yet, because of the geometry, you are

451
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,640
inevitably going to be forced to have dislocations. And these dislocations, as I said, can take the

452
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,720
form of edge and screw dislocations. How do we understand these? Okay, same picture. I have to

453
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,920
couple the environment with the behavior, and with the airflow. In this case, I'm going to

454
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,000
think of now three fluids interacting with each other. As I said, the population of a termite

455
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,960
mound can be in the order of millions. I have two classes of termite mounds, mounds, termites,

456
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,640
which are loaded. So they have a bit of clay, particle of clay that they're moving around.

457
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,320
I have termite mounds which are unloaded. The mounds which are loaded are going to essentially

458
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,680
respond to gradients in pheromone and then drop the nest material at some particular location.

459
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,120
That changes the local porosity. That local porosity changes the dynamics of how the pheromone is

460
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,280
moving around in the presence or in the absence of airflow. That then changes the behavior of the

461
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,480
termite. And we have to essentially couple these exactly like what I was showing you before.

462
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,320
What Guy and his collaborators had shown a couple of years before, we started working on this

463
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,040
by looking at the behavior of individual termites in a Petri dish. So they weren't able to build

464
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,040
anything on the scale of a mound itself, but they were able to build small attempts that the

465
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,760
termites made to create these layered structures. And they found that the building rate is proportional

466
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,920
to first approximation of the pheromone concentration. And the removal rate is not

467
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,480
proportional. It's constant. So they essentially build more and more in response to higher and

468
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,080
higher concentrations. But then when they break it, they break it at a uniform rate.

469
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,320
And I'm going to use this in a model. And here is my model. And I'm sorry, it's a bit messy.

470
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,400
But let me explain what the physics is associated with each one of these equations. And these are

471
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,720
just essentially conservation laws and some reaction diffusion type equations. Let me explain

472
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,920
what. So the nest material, U is the nest material. When U varies from zero to one, it's either not

473
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,680
there at all or it's solid when it's one. Nest material is moved around in consequence of termites

474
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,440
which are loaded and destroyed because of termites which are essentially taking material away.

475
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,560
N plus and N minus are the populations of the termites which are loaded and unloaded.

476
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,960
And the nest, when it's being built, is assumed to be a soft porous solid. So it's like clay,

477
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,760
which will gradually settle down. And that's settling down. We build in through this term over

478
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,000
here. G is an effective gravity. It's essentially just loading the system. The fact that this is a

479
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,120
diffusion equation is consistent with the case. If I have a porous system which is just heavy

480
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,960
without any loading or unloading, without activity, it will start to sag. That's essentially why the

481
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,240
Leaning Tower of Pisa is leaning over large periods of time because of differences in the

482
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,720
foundation and the soil around it. It starts to essentially degrade. So that's the nest material.

483
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,160
The termite workers themselves are diffusing their chemo-tactic because they essentially

484
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,400
respond to gradients in the soil through chemo-tactic coefficient. And the termite workers themselves

485
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,840
can switch from being loaded to unloaded with a rate k. This diffusivity which is non-linear is

486
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,480
simply there because you can't have any diffusivity when u is equal to 1 since it's a solid. So it's

487
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,480
essentially completely gone. When u is equal to 1, it's a solid. Therefore, the termites can't move

488
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,440
at all. And finally, the pheromone concentration is diffusion. There is addition because of the

489
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,120
pheromones, because of the termites which are loaded. And there is a rate of degradation.

490
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,040
And the building and removal rates are very simple forms which essentially are proportional to the

491
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,520
loading of the loaded termites or the unloaded termites. And this u times 1 minus u is precisely

492
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,840
again so that it vanishes when you have no material and it also vanishes when there is only a solid.

493
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,720
So you can do a linear stability analysis and pull out the dimensionless parameters.

494
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,120
And the key dimensionless parameters that matter are the rate at which

495
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,840
diffusion and degradation arise in the pheromone concentration, a rate associated with the settling,

496
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:40,640
and the chemo-tactic coefficient. How strongly or how weakly do the termites respond to gradients

497
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:49,120
in pheromones? Here is an example of a simulation. I hope that you can see it. You get this layered

498
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:55,200
structure. The layer spacing is essentially, it shouldn't surprise you, anybody who's looked

499
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,160
at these reaction diffusion equations, you always get a spacing when you balance degradation with

500
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,600
diffusion. There's a characteristic length scale, which is this square root of those two. It turns

501
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,800
out for the values that we have in the system, this characteristic balance between diffusion and

502
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,520
degradation dominate and give you this spacing. No surprises that you also get edge dislocation

503
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,040
like structures and you also get screw dislocation like structures because you will never be able

504
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,000
to build perfectly when you're trying to essentially get layers. The only last point which I want to

505
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,560
make is what sets the orientation of the layers and the orientation of the layers is set by

506
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,640
gravity. It's essentially right there because otherwise you could say, oh, why should it be

507
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,800
layered this way? Why can't it be layered this way? Or why can't it be layered that way? And that's

508
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,320
because the settling is happening in one direction. So gravity in a very humble but profound, I would

509
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:48,560
say, way dominates both the physics of the large scale buoyancy driven circulation and on this

510
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:56,720
small scale setting the polarization of the layer orientation as well. Okay, that's my second

511
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:08,080
story about mound micro morphogenesis and I hope that it's clear no plan, no planner, there isn't

512
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:13,040
even a representation of the task. Okay, we think about intelligence requiring representation,

513
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:20,240
there is no representation anywhere. There is all that's happening is local sensing and local

514
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:26,240
action and out of that you can essentially get these structures and I want to emphasize

515
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,400
these are also out of equilibrium. They are not solutions of any variation problems even though

516
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,640
they look like they may have a variational way of getting there, for example, in the crystals.

517
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,280
So therefore they're both repairable and they're also adaptable. They're repairable because if I

518
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,080
monkey around with what happens at one location, immediately these dynamics will essentially change

519
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,800
the way in the pheromone moves around and therefore it will repair itself and it's also adaptable

520
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,640
for the same reason because if the temperature variations are present, then you will essentially

521
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,080
upscale or downscale the pattern. I'm just wondering what limits the size of the pheromone

522
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:08,800
and also the size of the population. So the size I believe is associated with the population,

523
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,000
it's scaled with the population. Now you're asking what sets the population and I don't

524
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,240
know the answer. I do know that what has been seen and that's primarily in these three

525
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:29,200
mounds, so they're not really mounds, they're much smaller nests. You will see characteristic

526
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,680
population and term and mound size correlate very well. In the context of mounds on the ground,

527
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,760
you have to have ground penetrating radar or something of that sort to be able to first

528
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,160
know where to even look and then start asking the question. I don't really have a whole lot to say.

529
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,840
Context of how long do they persist? I think the question that you're asking is a question of

530
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:58,640
is it more efficient to repair a mound or as it ages and it's physical aging or is it better

531
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:05,440
to start a new mound and so that's I think now much harder question to understand in the absence

532
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,040
of any data. I mean you can make up a story that past some age it just becomes very hard to continuously

533
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,840
repair the mounds and then you start making another one but that's my stories as good as yours.

534
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,280
Okay all right so I have 10 minutes or less? Okay so I want to switch maybe I'll just give

535
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,640
you a brief view. I think you must have heard some of it from Orit. I'll give you...

536
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:36,480
Do you know any of the communication industry of this and strategies? I mean all that term

537
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,600
might sort of crap at building mounds or is there any comparative data that gives you a feeling for that?

538
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,600
There probably is. I am not able to recall having quantitative data. I can tell you about

539
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,840
quantitative data from an evolutionary point of view associated with the fact that because we've

540
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,920
studied three different species in three different continents you know the size of the mound, the

541
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:11,360
shape of the mound we can qualitatively understand using these scaling laws. Temperature variations

542
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,480
becoming larger, the mound becomes larger, populations becoming larger, the mound becoming

543
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,480
larger. If you're now asking me can you predict the exponents? I mean we can but can you essentially

544
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:30,800
verify anything? No, zero. I mean these experiments, yeah, no. So the only part of the history is we've

545
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,120
studied three different species in three different continents. They're all conforming with the model.

546
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,880
They are qualitatively consistent.

547
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:48,560
You know I have another life where we actually study just the physics of things where I think we can

548
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:55,040
be a lot more hard-nosed about exponents and phase diagrams and so on and if I try to compare it with

549
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:01,360
that part we are very far away unfortunately. So this is all qualitative at this point,

550
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:09,280
unfortunately. Okay, all right. In the next 10 minutes I want to first give you a view of the

551
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,640
kinds of problems we've studied with bees but I won't tell you about any of them and then I'll

552
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,400
switch to ants if I have a little bit of time but I'm also happy to stop after. It's okay. So this is

553
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:27,040
a bee beard if you like in the Concord Field Station and you know on a day like this actually

554
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:34,960
at a time like this but probably about seven years ago or so, eight years ago and so you know this

555
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:43,440
cluster of bees is hanging by essentially holding on to its neighbors. Okay and why is it doing this?

556
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,960
So probably the most famous thing that everybody knows about in the context of collective behavior

557
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,000
of bees is associated with the waggle dance. Okay so when the bees essentially have to make a

558
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,240
decision about creating or moving to a new home then there's this remarkable set of events. First

559
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:09,760
I think described by Carl von Frisch in the 1930s and 40s for which as I said he and Thinbergen

560
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:16,720
and Conrad Lorenz shared Nobel Prize in 1967 and 68 where the bees essentially signal to each other

561
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:24,480
by waggling their bodies, changing their orientation and having more or less vigor associated with a

562
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,960
location. Once that decision has been made the bees have to move from one location to the other

563
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,000
and they typically move in over a period of days so they don't have the capacity to do this in one

564
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,080
day and if they do this as it will typically happen at this time of the year early spring then

565
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,480
there's a potential problem which is that they may freeze at night and to prevent freezing at night

566
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,480
they essentially have to create a bivouac for the night for maybe two nights maybe three nights

567
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,720
and this is the kind of bivouac that they treat where where they create where they essentially

568
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,400
hold on to each other so this is a potential solution to two problems one you need to be

569
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,360
mechanically stable so you have to hold on to the branch not at one point but over some finite

570
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:11,360
length of the branch or the bow and another is to essentially minimize the amount of surface to

571
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,880
reduce the amount of loss heat loss and there's very nice questions not just associated with

572
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,800
how they form these structures but even the structure of the structure itself which means

573
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,400
what which means what type of bees are on the outside and what type of bees on the inside

574
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,880
for example we know due to the work of Bernd Heinrich from the 1970s that in fact the younger

575
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,640
bees are on the inside the older bees on the outside not only that the bees on the outside

576
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,200
have pneumatic order okay so a very beautiful set of questions associated with trying to minimize

577
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,200
the thermal shock and the mechanical shock so a few years ago with Jake Peters and Ulpela we studied

578
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,720
this and I want to show you an experiment where Jake did and I won't tell you what the theory

579
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,560
which was done a few years ago so here's an experiment Jake basically took a piece of wood

580
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,480
created a little cage to which he attached which he attached to the piece of wood and within which

581
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,960
he also had a queen and then the bees essentially aggregated around that and he put this whole

582
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,600
thing inside a box and changed the temperature so you want to essentially understand how does this

583
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,160
cluster respond to temperature variations okay let me show you

584
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:34,400
the temperature is cycling from between 15 degrees 14 degrees or so the bees will go into a chill

585
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,960
coma and it's changing over a period of a few hours and what you see is essentially a porous

586
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,280
medium which is capable of responding by becoming more porous or less porous it becomes more porous

587
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,400
as it heats up and becomes less porous as it cools down what does that mean that means that

588
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,080
it becomes hotter and hotter you essentially create change the porosity and by changing the porosity

589
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,640
you can essentially get airflow and by changing the airflow you can get dynamics and cooling and

590
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:07,040
then when it cold when it becomes cold it shrinks and you know we understand we teach students how

591
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,160
to do calculations of heat conduction temperature variations and so on in the context of a first

592
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:18,560
course in thermodynamics and this is very cool because it's functional and it's active so what

593
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,920
are the bees doing so they're essentially spreading themselves out or moving their legs out or moving

594
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,480
their legs in and one can make some sense out of this so this is an example of if you want

595
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,280
where temperature regulation is associated with changing the physicality the embodiment of how

596
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,600
the collective essentially responds we're seeing the porosity is like the area

597
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,360
that's the simplest measure or it has now gone on I think I've actually measured in fact using an

598
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:48,640
x she's put the whole hive into a tomograph and she can essentially watch what is inside right

599
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,080
now you can just see it's the same number of bees how do we know that we can measure the weight

600
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,000
before and after and we can see that the same number of bees the volume is much larger therefore

601
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,120
the porosity has increased and the density has decreased and therefore in the surface area right

602
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,400
there has to be naturally a change in the surface area but the total number of bees kept is kept

603
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,560
constant yeah okay there's mechanical adaptation so as I said you have to change you have to

604
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,160
figure out how to maintain temperature you have to also figure out how to essentially respond

605
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,440
to shocks mechanical shocks so if I put you inside an elevator and I start shaking you what would you

606
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,560
do I mean I've shown you the result over there but what would you do individually okay move to

607
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,120
the ground so that you can basically move and have your center of mass as low as possible or go to a

608
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:35,280
wall this happens collectively as well okay so when I start shaking the cluster of bees they

609
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:42,720
start spreading out okay so this is very interesting because this is a kind of mechanical if you want

610
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,760
way of distributing the load because if the bees at the base have to take up all the load the bees

611
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,160
at the tip don't have to take up any of the load at all and yet they do so so is this a mechanical

612
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,320
altruism I don't know okay because all that's happening move all the bees to the to the surface

613
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:07,760
and therefore the load on all of them reduces and they're much happier okay so you can you can make

614
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,240
sense of this again using a theoretical model which I'm pretty sure Orit has talked to you about

615
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:19,360
but fundamentally it's playing with a collective version of a set of pendula which can essentially

616
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,240
oscillate from side to side we can also oscillate up and down so you have two degrees of freedom

617
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,880
you have a whole collection of them and you can show that functionally load distribution is much

618
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:35,680
much better and much more robust when you flatten out at high amplitudes or high frequencies and

619
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:41,440
then there is a third problem so this is mechanical thermal regulation that's mechanical adaptation

620
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,720
and and and then there is the hydrodynamics of ventilation so in the termite mound the mound

621
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,960
is more or less fixed and the whole mound works as a lung

622
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:59,040
in the bee box the bees can't question yeah what would be the trade-off between shaking

623
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:06,640
very good between these two yeah I don't have an answer what we do find is that you can see

624
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:14,000
over here the yeah why don't we can you ask me the question at the end I'll come back to that

625
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,040
because it's a very difficult question associated with you know if I want to be mechanically stable

626
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,240
and thermally relatively well insulated what kinds of shapes do you get I mean we have some thoughts

627
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,000
on that but just can you hold on and ask me the question at the end okay so I want to contrast

628
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
ventilation in the termite mound where the mound is fixed and temperature variations as a function

629
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,400
of time are converted to spatial gradients which lead to flows in a bee box the bee box is fixed

630
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,360
and a remarkable solution seems to present itself um on the solution so this is the bee box right

631
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,360
here this is where the brood is now let me show you

632
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,040
at the entrance fan okay question for you which way should you fan

633
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:12,640
and where first which way and then where outwards or inwards

634
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,040
why

635
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:33,600
not only to remove the question or comment you say inwards good okay turns out that

636
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,080
you want to actually pull air you want to you want to get outwards why because I can measure

637
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,400
not only can I essentially ventilate but I can measure I can measure what is happening inside

638
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,600
the hive or inside the bee box by pulling material by pulling the air out and now there are two

639
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:54,800
solutions okay if I can pull air out I can do this by modulating in time that's how we do when we breathe

640
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,520
same entrance and same exit we modulate in time okay I don't have to modulate in time alone I can

641
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:08,560
modulate in space so it depends on the size of the orifice if I had a very wide mouth I can say

642
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,120
at one part I essentially pull in and if I pull in at one part I can continuously pull in and the

643
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,480
other part just by continuity you just move out and that's the second solution that we find so

644
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,920
they always pull out and then they will spontaneously when they start out originally being homogeneous

645
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,560
distributed they will end up on one boundary or the other so there's a transition there's an instability

646
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,480
and that essentially drives the transition all the bees which are pulling out end up on one side

647
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,880
and then they can continuously pull out and the advantage is when I'm measuring and I am

648
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,480
ventilating now if I need more bees I just have to signal and so bees have a nason off gland they

649
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,680
have essentially a whole set of pheromones associated with signaling so they push that signal out and

650
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,560
the same wind which is essentially associated with pulling the air out now you can essentially

651
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,600
advect you've probably all heard of stigmergy and in the context of stigmergy using diffusion

652
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,440
to essentially signal now using flow which of course that means you're essentially improving

653
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,120
the efficiency enormously because instead of square root of time it's going linearly as time

654
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:10,400
and this is what bees do so they will first start pulling out then they will essentially end up on

655
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,120
one side and then finally they will essentially get other bees to join using this nason off

656
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,280
sensing mechanism and you can construct a mathematical framework for this you can do

657
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:26,640
experiments and so on okay I think I have run out of time so I am happy to stop here for anybody

658
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,720
and same thing in every one of these problems in the termite case in the all the bee cases

659
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:38,000
there was local sensing there's local actuation here it's heat transport here with mechanical

660
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
vibrations here it's fluid flow and heat transport and carbon dioxide all of these things

661
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,080
embodied or available to you I wouldn't even say embodied local sensing and actuation is

662
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:56,880
embodied the rest is there and and it's used repeatedly by these organisms so I will stop

663
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:06,000
by going to the last slide I had I think three slides four slides I'm going to go to the last slide

664
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:15,280
and happy to talk to people about ants if you want to stay I showed you some examples of how

665
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,800
large-scale problem solving can happen very very simply using local sensing and actuation

666
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:28,480
and critically it's mediated by physical fields which you cannot ignore because all this happened

667
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:35,920
in the world it didn't happen in some abstract brain or with a set of circuits alone second

668
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,520
thing this idea that you can separately study you know the living and non-living perhaps but

669
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:49,520
certainly in these social systems and super organisms I don't think so and I want to bring

670
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,440
to mind I think somebody who I'm sure is a great inspiration for people here as as as he has been

671
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:02,320
for me which is associated with the parable of the ant I think Herb Simon famously showed

672
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,800
an image of an ant showing some very very complicated path and without showing the

673
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,480
environment at all and the point that he wanted to make is that it looks like a very complicated

674
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,280
path because you've forgotten what the environment and as soon as you put the environment in

675
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,440
everything starts to essentially make itself much more clear and so rather than thinking

676
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,200
only about embodiment should we be extending it in order to account for the environment as well

677
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:34,080
well I showed you these examples Stigmergy's diffusive signaling flow is advective vibrations

678
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:41,120
is non-local just like flow I want to emphasize what I said before you can have what you might

679
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:46,880
think of as adaptable learnable solutions but you don't need representation you don't need plan

680
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,480
you don't need planner and you automatically get robustness because you've distributed a lot of

681
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,480
everything that you want to do into very simple local rules okay last point I want to come back

682
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,200
to where I started unfortunately I didn't have a chance to tell you about this but I am happy

683
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:09,040
to talk to people privately we've really started now asking questions of how hard or how easy it

684
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:14,800
is to do this from a synthetic perspective and not synthetic biology but if you want synthetic

685
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:21,200
engineering mathematical models of course are a way to synthesize systems but also physical

686
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,600
mimics and I'll close with a question which I think inspired a lot of people over here and

687
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:32,720
continues to inspire me you know just like Curing was thinking about intelligence can we think

688
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,280
about behavior the same way how much of what is happening can I essentially understand by

689
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:46,400
looking at collective behavior and if we can't then I think this quest of pushing towards ever

690
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:52,960
smaller mechanistic understanding of the molecular scale may be a lost cause you can only say what

691
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:58,960
is minimally needed you can perhaps say what is sufficient but beyond that it's very very hard to

692
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,600
say exactly all the different things all the different ways in which you can essentially come

693
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,560
up with a solution and that's of course not at all surprising because inverse problems are notoriously

694
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:14,320
ill-posed unless I have regularization unless I have mathematically or physically ways of

695
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,200
essentially saying these are the classes of solutions that I'm able to deal with I can't

696
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,240
really answer that question how do I deduce the rules by looking at the behavior for example if I'd

697
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,440
shown you you know these robots as individual particles could you tell me whether they were

698
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,960
actual robots whether they were termites and if you can't I think there's a real issue with asking

699
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,600
that kind of a question okay on that I will stop thank you so much I'm sorry I went over

700
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,240
gotta get out of here

701
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:58,320
so it's interesting this

702
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,560
What's in it, dude, is what's in it.

703
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,280
So, physics for you is embodiment.

704
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:10,280
So, right, so the non-local large space scales,

705
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,940
net scales are coming from physics.

706
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:17,040
And whereas us, we get it from the whole body.

707
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,640
We don't need the physics to do the work.

708
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,480
Our body does the work.

709
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,440
I'm just wondering.

710
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,240
I would say that even for us, the environment is critical.

711
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,760
Well, I'm not saying it's not critical,

712
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,280
but in this narrative, if you're that tiny termite,

713
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,000
the only way you get this on non-local information

714
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,360
is from the physics, right?

715
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,720
From these circulations.

716
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,560
Whereas we can get it from long axons.

717
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,920
I don't need physics to do the work.

718
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,160
Well, I would say the long axons

719
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,920
are probably one of the physical solutions.

720
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,200
But anyway, but keep going.

721
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,600
Well, if that was, then you'd be inconsistent

722
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,120
in the way your narrative works

723
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,800
because that's a part of the organism, right?

724
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,200
You could say nerve conduction is physics or something,

725
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,920
but not useful conception physics seems to me.

726
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,840
But I'm just wondering whether or not

727
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,320
there are sort of two worlds.

728
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,360
There's the world of little things.

729
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,040
And the only way they can build large structures

730
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,360
is by obtaining these non-local information

731
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,000
from physical principles.

732
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,800
And there's an activity to go to us

733
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,520
where you just build large-scale biological structure,

734
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,400
which does the work, and physics becomes auxiliary.

735
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:33,360
Let me, first of all, say that even for,

736
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,560
so for us, are you saying that

737
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,440
if I wanted to build something large,

738
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,280
I cannot do it using physics?

739
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,520
I cannot, but there are these two very different ways

740
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,640
of doing it.

741
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:48,640
Yeah, so let me frame this from an evolutionary point of view.

742
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,880
So these organisms have been around

743
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,480
for 100 times longer than us,

744
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,260
for 350 million years.

745
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,680
With relatively simple, I think, compared to us,

746
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,240
in going along exactly the direction

747
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,260
that you're going, cognitive rules,

748
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:12,260
and yet capable of solving these physiological tasks

749
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,720
which are common across the entire animal kingdom.

750
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,720
If I have societies, I have to worry

751
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:21,080
about large-scale respiration, large-scale physiology,

752
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,000
locomotion, predation, pre-capture, and so on.

753
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,800
In early evolution, this is a solution that came to be.

754
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,400
As evolution moved on, and this is a question

755
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,600
to which I don't really have an answer

756
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,040
in the sense that I'm satisfied with.

757
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,440
I mean, there are a lot of words,

758
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,440
but I don't know how to convert that

759
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,600
into anything more quantitative.

760
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,880
Can you have a notion of assimilation?

761
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,560
That is to say, you take these physics-based rules

762
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,040
which are part of the environment,

763
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,600
and then you build them into the body.

764
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,640
When I build them into the body,

765
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,640
I have the ability to move by essentially coordination.

766
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,400
That was previously, this bee talked to that bee,

767
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,360
which talked to that bee, and they all moved together.

768
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,840
But now I say, no, let me just make a super bee,

769
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,000
and I connect them all together.

770
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,640
Now they become part of the organism, super organism.

771
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,080
So I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying.

772
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:22,400
I don't see a temporal path which tells you how to start here,

773
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,400
because these have been around, as I said,

774
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,240
for a hundred times longer than us.

775
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,360
They're multicellular.

776
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,400
They solve, by the way, the same kind of problems

777
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,160
that we solve on the organismal level.

778
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,520
I didn't talk about the physiology of respiration.

779
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,800
In insect respiration, it's very different from our respiration.

780
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,440
Small insects don't need lungs.

781
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,240
They don't need lungs because they can essentially

782
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,000
interact directly with the environment through spiracles,

783
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,160
which means diffusive transport is good enough.

784
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,520
You become big, you have to change your rules.

785
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,560
So I'm not disagreeing at all with you.

786
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:58,160
I guess my concern is, is it really a discrete setting,

787
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:02,440
because I sort of think of this as a whole spectrum of solutions?

788
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,960
Let's imagine, if the termite might now and now say,

789
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,880
right, and you just stomp the bout

790
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,280
and move around in the environment, right?

791
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,640
At that point, these principles are kind of useless,

792
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,080
because that degree of integration is not going to be achieved

793
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,480
by advection and diffusion anymore.

794
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,520
That's why we have neuron, long neurons, right?

795
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,240
So in other words, there really is a distinction

796
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,400
that comes in once you have these more structured interactions.

797
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,120
So I would say that transition is not as discrete

798
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,680
as I think what I'm hearing you say.

799
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,920
This is a distributed solution.

800
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,800
If I don't know whether you're saying

801
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,080
that you also have possibilities for centralized solutions,

802
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,920
centralized brains, if you're not saying that,

803
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:42,840
then I think we don't disagree.

804
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,200
But if you are, then I would say I'm not sure that I agree.

805
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh, it's not central, but...

806
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,040
Because you can think about cephalopods, yeah.

807
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,320
Central, I'm not using that central.

808
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,000
Just this idea that, anyway,

809
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,760
but this idea that advection and diffusion,

810
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,840
we don't have a nervous system that does its work.

811
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,280
I don't do vision by advection and diffusion.

812
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,560
Oh, I didn't talk only about advection and diffusion.

813
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,320
I talked about there are all kinds of other things

814
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,680
that are mechanical, there's movement,

815
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,920
there's all kinds of other things as well.

816
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,720
I mean, I gave you a couple of examples

817
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,880
where you can have active movement,

818
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,480
which can essentially solve problems in morphogenesis.

819
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,760
And if you ask me questions about vision,

820
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,720
I mean, understanding how the orientation

821
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,080
dominance columns arise,

822
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,320
actually it is advection and diffusion

823
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,120
coupled with stimuli,

824
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:31,400
which lead to ocular dominance columns arising.

825
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,560
We can have...

826
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,480
Dominance columns arrive through a strict connectivity

827
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,440
of neurons through reciprocal advection.

828
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,520
That's how ocular dominance columns arrive.

829
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,560
There is an underlying connectivity that gives...

830
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,080
Yeah, but how do you get the connectivity in the first place?

831
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:46,920
No, it's fair enough.

832
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,760
That's different.

833
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,840
I mean, no, but that's part of...

834
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,720
You can't put the connectivity in.

835
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,320
You've got to get the connectivity out.

836
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,320
We should continue to see that.

837
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,600
Yeah, yeah.

838
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Okay, thank you.
