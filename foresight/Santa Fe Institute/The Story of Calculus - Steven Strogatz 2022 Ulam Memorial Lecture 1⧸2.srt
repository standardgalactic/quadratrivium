00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,160
Many of you know Steve from his New York Times column,

26
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
his blog about mathematics,

27
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,520
where he showed how mathematics was essentially, in our modern world, ambiant.

28
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560

...which was again as a reassuring for me that it wasn't that exciting.

I'm sure many of you have heard.

46
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,540
At the result of Steve and Duncan Watts' article.

47
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,260
was one of our early postdocs, actually, after he'd finished working with Steve.

48
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,740
And this is one of the foundational papers in network science.

49
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,340
It built on sociological research and it added modern techniques of non-linear dynamics

50
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,260
and statistical physics and really revolutionized how we do a whole range of different sciences

51
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,620
now from sociology to network science in the internet.

52
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,900
Steve is also the author of several books that I'm sure some of you purchased up front.

53
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,300
So he writes both for technical audiences and for popular audiences and does so extremely well.

54
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,340
His book on non-linear dynamics and chaos from 1994 is a completely standard textbook

55
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,460
that many of us used in learning the field.

56
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,900
But he also wrote popular books like Sink, The Joy of X and Infinite Powers.

57
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,380
Will it be for sale still after the lecture?

58
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:44,900
Tomorrow.

59
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,220
OK, tomorrow night if you haven't bought a copy and go ahead and sign it.

60
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,060
So these lectures are the Stan Ulam Memorial Lectures.

61
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:04,500
And Stan Ulam was a mathematician who also wrote a popular book called Adventures of a Mathematician.

62
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,420
Stan was born in Poland.

63
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,020
He worked in Princeton, Harvard, Madison before coming to Los Alamos.

64
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,380
Steve shares Harvard and Princeton with Stan.

65
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:22,900
And in that book, Stan Ulam writes, theoretical physics, meaning mathematical physics,

66
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:29,940
is possible because there are many identical or nearly identical copies of objects and situations.

67
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,180
Science would not be possible.

68
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,460
Physics would not be conceivable if there was not this similarity or identity of vast numbers of points

69
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,500
or subsets or groups of points in the universe.

70
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,540
And Steve's work on networks and dynamical systems more generally

71
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,940
have revealed how in complex systems, which are full of particularities,

72
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,180
you find these kinds of universalities that even in the world of biological life,

73
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,780
there are universalities not unlike those that we observe in physics.

74
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,340
So join me in welcoming Steve to give the first of two Ulam Lectures.

75
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:17,100
Well, thank you very much, David, and thanks to all of you for coming out tonight.

76
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,700
Thank you too for our online audience on Zoom or on YouTube.

77
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,380
It's really, wow, what a big treat it is to be here speaking to you tonight.

78
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:33,340
My wife and I always love coming back to Santa Fe, and I can't tell you how honoured I am

79
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,300
to be giving the Ulam Lectures.

80
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,300
As you can see here, I've posted a little picture of Stan Ulam,

81
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,300
and he meant a lot to me.

82
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
I never had the pleasure of meeting him.

83
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,300
But when I was a teenager in high school, already in love with math and physics,

84
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,300
my beloved mentor, Mr De Curcio, gave me a book, A Graduation Present,

85
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
that he inscribed very affectionately.

86
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,300
And it was this book, Adventures of a Mathematician, SM Ulam,

87
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,300
who I had not heard of at that time.

88
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,300
But I learned a lot about him from the book.

89
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,300
It's a very candid and funny, quirky book.

90
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,300
You may be able to see, I don't know, the writing may be a little too small on that image on the side.

91
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,300
But it describes Ulam as, certainly true, a member of the famous Polish Mathematical School.

92
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,300
He'll be remembered probably forever as the person who invented the hydrogen bomb.

93
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Edward Teller was working on it, but couldn't quite get it to work theoretically,

94
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,300
and Ulam figured out how to make it work for good or evil.

95
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
I don't know. This is how he'll be remembered, I suspect.

96
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,300
Which is a little bit of a pity, because in the world of math,

97
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,300
we think of him as one of the most creative mathematicians of the 20th century.

98
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,300
He thought of the method that we call the Monte Carlo method in constant use today

99
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,300
for solving all kinds of difficult probabilistic calculations.

100
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,300
He was extremely ingenious, and even in the subject that David mentioned,

101
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,300
my own subject, nonlinear dynamics, within Rico Fermi and other colleagues at Los Alamos,

102
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,300
he thought of ways to use what were then the very first computers to do scientific research,

103
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,300
not just to do calculations, but to perform computer experiments

104
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,300
and to learn things that you couldn't see either through pencil and paper or through observation.

105
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
You could see the invisible in the computer.

106
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,300
It was like a new kind of telescope or microscope for the mind. This was his idea.

107
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,300
Reading the book, one thing struck me that was a little puzzling,

108
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,300
which is he doesn't talk much about his wife.

109
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,300
She's in there, but she doesn't get mentioned so much,

110
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:01,300
and his wife Francoise, it turns out, actually is the writer of the book.

111
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,300
It's her modesty that we have to blame for her large absence in the book.

112
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Francoise was a terrific writer. She had a degree in comparative literature,

113
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,300
and they had quite the love affair, I think, quite a great relationship,

114
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
giving birth to a daughter, Claire.

115
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:29,300
I had the pleasure to meet, well, there's Steve Weiner, who's here tonight.

116
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,300
That's Claire Weiner, and then their daughter, Rebecca Ulam Weiner.

117
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
I also had the pleasure to meet recently.

118
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Anyway, so, yes, Francoise and Stan, quite the striking couple, weren't they?

119
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
I just want to leave you with one thought before I turn to my lecture proper here,

120
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
which is this remark of Stan's.

121
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,300
By the way, so the point was that he's dictating, he's telling stories to Francoise,

122
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,300
and she's writing them down and embellishing them and cleaning them up mostly.

123
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Anyway, Stan says, it's still an unending source of surprise for me

124
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,300
to see how a few scribbles on a blackboard could change the course of human affairs,

125
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,300
to say the least, you know, if you think about what he did with the hydrogen bomb,

126
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:24,300
but also with his work really revolutionizing the way that we use computers in math and science.

127
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,300
So, with that, let me take up Ulam's theme of how a few scribbles can change the course of history,

128
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,300
because this is really what my story is about tonight.

129
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,300
The story of calculus is exactly that story.

130
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Without calculus, we wouldn't have really anything that we are used to in the modern world.

131
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,300
We certainly wouldn't have radio, television, microwave ovens.

132
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,300
We wouldn't have been able to send astronauts to the moon or unravel the structure of DNA.

133
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Looking at those pictures, can I ask you a little quiz?

134
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Maybe for the younger people, I wonder.

135
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:06,300
If we've got some kids in the audience, does anyone know who's over there on the left?

136
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,300
You may have seen her in a movie recently or read about her.

137
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Anyone want to shout it out?

138
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:23,300
That is Catherine Johnson, one of the hidden figures speaking of use of computers to solve important problems.

139
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Actually, Catherine Johnson was a human calculator at the time when that referred to people.

140
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,300
The calculator was a person or even they were sometimes called computers.

141
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Anyway, so then you see also Catherine in her 90s receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama.

142
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Getting choked up thinking about her hidden figure status.

143
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,300
What about the other woman? Do you know who that is? Unraveling the structure of DNA?

144
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Right, of course. That's Rosalind Franklin.

145
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:01,300
She is there next to her famous picture, an x-ray diffraction picture, revealing the helical structure of DNA.

146
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Before Watson and Crick realized that, she in a way was channeling calculus.

147
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,300
To interpret an x-ray diffraction picture like that one you see next to her,

148
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,300
she had to use an outgrowth of calculus called Fourier analysis.

149
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Just as Catherine Johnson was using differential equations to design trajectories to get our astronauts to the moon and back again safely.

150
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:32,300
So it's calculus throughout. It's in ultrasound for expectant mothers.

151
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,300
It's GPS for maybe getting you home tonight or lost travelers in general.

152
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:47,300
And as I already mentioned for nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, calculus throughout has helped make the world modern in so many ways.

153
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:55,300
So there's a mystery though in that, which is the calculus grew out of geometry.

154
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
And you might ask the question, and I want to explore this with you tonight.

155
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:11,300
How could it be that an arcane branch of math originally about shapes, specifically curved shapes, how could that have ultimately reshaped civilization?

156
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,300
And so I want to try to personify that question in the form of this gentleman, Herman Woke.

157
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Some of you will know that Herman Woke was really a great American novelist of my parents' generation.

158
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,300
The World War II generation looked to Herman Woke.

159
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,300
He had served as a sailor in World War II.

160
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:40,300
He wanted to write the sort of big definitive novel about World War II

161
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:47,300
and ended up ballooning into two novels, The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, very famous books made into movies.

162
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:53,300
Cain Mutiny, you probably know that story, the book and movie, Humphrey Bogart in the movie anyway.

163
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,300
So Woke, when he was thinking about writing his big novel about World War II, someone told him,

164
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,300
you know, if you're going to write about the bomb, let's say, and the scientists who helped make the bomb,

165
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,300
you really ought to go talk to this gentleman, Richard Feynman.

166
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Now, you'll recognize that there's a lot of Los Alamos and Santa Fe in these stories I'm telling here tonight.

167
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Richard Feynman, of course, young, brilliant physicist, worked at Los Alamos on the bomb.

168
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:32,300
And so he was happy to receive Woke for their conversation about what was really happening, the inside story of the Manhattan Project.

169
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Feynman, you'll see there in the pictures teaching at Caltech.

170
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:44,300
He was a joker known for breaking into the safe at Los Alamos, going to strip clubs, playing his bongos character.

171
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,300
And anyway, so the two guys are talking.

172
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Now, Woke and Feynman were both from New York City.

173
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
They found that they had that in common.

174
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
They were both Jewish guys, but there were also differences.

175
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,300
I mean, they had both served in the war, but Woke was very devout.

176
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,300
And Feynman was very much of an atheist.

177
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,300
And they found that they had a lot to talk about all around, and they had a good chat.

178
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Anyway, they found themselves becoming friends.

179
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:20,300
And by the end of the chat, Feynman says to him in his, I guess, far rockaway accent that I won't attempt to imitate.

180
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,300
But something like, so you're really going to write this book.

181
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Okay, I have one question for you.

182
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Do you know calculus?

183
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,300
And Woke admits, well, no, I never studied calculus.

184
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,300
And then Feynman stares at him and says, well, you better learn it.

185
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,300
It's the language God talks.

186
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,300
And that became the title of a book that Woke wrote later, the language God talks.

187
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:55,300
You can maybe see the subtitle on science and religion about his conversations with prominent scientists,

188
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,300
John Weinberg, Feynman, a number of other, mostly atheists, about science and religion.

189
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Are those irreconcilable? Are they compatible?

190
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,300
So I commend that book to your attention if you're interested in the relationship between science and religion.

191
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:16,300
But in particular, on the point of calculus, is it necessary to learn calculus as Feynman admonished him?

192
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
He needed to learn calculus.

193
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Woke took him seriously, and he tells the story of what happened.

194
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,300
He says, I picked up and skimmed some freshman texts in college bookstores,

195
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,300
hoping to come across one that might help a mathematical ignoramus like me,

196
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,300
who had spent his college years in the humanities, i.e. literature and philosophy,

197
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,300
in an adolescent quest for the meaning of existence, like many college students.

198
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,300
A little knowing that calculus, which I had heard of as a difficult bore leading nowhere,

199
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
was the language God talks.

200
00:18:53,300 --> 00:19:03,300
So he's motivated to learn calculus, but then it turns out that it's hard for someone in his position to learn calculus.

201
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:11,300
It's really hard, and he tells stories about it that he couldn't get anything from these freshman textbooks.

202
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,300
It was gibberish to him, so that didn't seem to work.

203
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,300
He hired a tutor, who happened to be an Israeli guy,

204
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,300
because he thought he was a person who knew a lot about math,

205
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,300
but he thought maybe I could also pick up and improve my spoken Hebrew on the side,

206
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,300
which he was interested in, so anyway he's with this Israeli tutor.

207
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
That didn't really work out so well.

208
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Then, in fact, on both counts, and then he attended a high school class

209
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,300
and was very serious about going and doing all the homework for several weeks,

210
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,300
but he gradually fell behind and decided at some point to quit.

211
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,300
As he was leaving, he says that the students, all these teenagers, started clapping,

212
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,300
which he interpreted as sympathy applause, like for a pitiful showbiz act.

213
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:08,300
So my point is that it is not easy for many people to absorb the language God talks,

214
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
to learn calculus.

215
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,300
This made me personally sad thinking about this,

216
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,300
because I love calculus and want the world to appreciate it.

217
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,300
So I wrote this book recently, Infinite Powers,

218
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,300
subtitle How Calculus Reveals the Secret of the Universe.

219
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Secrets, yeah.

220
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Well, okay, you've got to sell books.

221
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,300
With people like Herman Woke in mind,

222
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,300
the reason I'm telling you the whole story is I want this talk to be accessible to anybody of goodwill,

223
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,300
like Herman Woke, an educated, curious person who didn't know much math,

224
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,300
but seriously wanted to get what is so special about calculus.

225
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,300
So I think of him as my ideal reader.

226
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Actually, I sent him a copy of the book through his agent,

227
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,300
but he was about 103 years old at that point.

228
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,300
And I was told that his wife had recently passed away,

229
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
a good long life for both of them.

230
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,300
But I don't know if he ever really received the book or read it,

231
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,300
so I don't have a good conclusion for you about that.

232
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,300
But I do sort of have Herman Woke in mind,

233
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,300
and this book is for you, Mr Woke, if you can hear me.

234
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,300
So let me try to address the question,

235
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,300
what did Feynman mean with that cryptic comment that calculus is the language God talks?

236
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
What could that possibly mean?

237
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,300
All right, so let's talk a little bit about one case study.

238
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,300
I want to tell you the story of electricity and magnetism

239
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,300
and what calculus taught us about those phenomena.

240
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,300
So electricity, all right, there's a little picture of my daughter,

241
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Leah, when she was much younger playing around in her grandmother's apartment,

242
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
and it was a wintry day. It was dry in the apartment.

243
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Her hair got all staticky.

244
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Lots of electrons rubbed off onto her hair without her knowing it.

245
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,300
They repelled each other. They made her hair look like that.

246
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
You're probably familiar with the phenomenon.

247
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,300
So yeah, that's static electricity.

248
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,300
There's also the electricity that's powering my microphone right now.

249
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
There's also magnetism.

250
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,300
You may have played around with bar magnets as a kid,

251
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,300
maybe even done a little experiment like this,

252
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,300
where you sprinkle iron filings on a piece of paper around a bar magnet,

253
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,300
and then amazingly, these iron filings reveal some kind of pattern.

254
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,300
They don't just form a random, you know, haphazard scatter on the page.

255
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,300
If you jiggle the page lightly, they start to align in this amazing, organized way,

256
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,300
suggesting that there's something around the magnet that is otherwise invisible

257
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,300
but that is now made manifest by these iron filings.

258
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Michael Faraday did experiments like this back in the 1820s and 30s

259
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,300
and came up with the idea that there is something, although invisible,

260
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,300
something very real around a magnet,

261
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,300
which he called lines of force visualized by these filings,

262
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
but we today call it the magnetic field.

263
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Similarly, there are invisible aspects of electricity

264
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
that we would call the electric field.

265
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,300
In the 1800s, scientists like Michael Faraday and Ampyr,

266
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:27,300
whose name lives on in the unit of electrical current, and Gauss and Ersted and many others,

267
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,300
were starting to try to figure out how do electricity and magnetism work.

268
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Faraday created the first electric motor and electromagnets and lots of other things.

269
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300
They started to realize there was this intimate relationship

270
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,300
like you could put a current through a wire and then the wire would start to act magnetic.

271
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,300
There would be a magnetic field around that wire with the current going through it and so on.

272
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Anyway, Faraday didn't have much math background,

273
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,300
but this gentleman did, James Clerk Maxwell.

274
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
There's a picture of him as a young man.

275
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,300
He was a Scottish physicist and a mathematical physicist.

276
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Usually you see him in pictures when he's much later in life with a big beard,

277
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,300
but I like this picture of him as a young man.

278
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,300
Anyway, he realized that what Faraday and others had been discovering

279
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,300
could be written in the language of calculus,

280
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,300
that there were certain laws about electricity and magnetism,

281
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:26,300
specifically how changing an electric field could produce magnetic effects

282
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,300
and changing electric fields, or did I say that first?

283
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Basically changing one can produce the other.

284
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Changing magnetism can generate electricity and vice versa.

285
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,300
He wrote what we would call differential equations,

286
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,300
meaning equations that describe how things change from moment to moment or place to place,

287
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,300
little differences in time or space, hence differential.

288
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:58,300
He wrote differential equations that encoded what Faraday and Ersted and Gauss and Ampere had discovered.

289
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,300
So now these physical discoveries from science, from tinkering,

290
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,300
were put in the language of math, and then comes the spooky part.

291
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,300
I mean it may not surprise you that math can describe physical phenomena.

292
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,300
We know that math is a language, but math is much more than a language,

293
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,300
and this is the part that I find uncanny, and that I think has something to do with what Feynman was talking about,

294
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,300
that with math you can actually manipulate equations.

295
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:31,300
You know that you can add and subtract if you're doing stuff with numbers,

296
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,300
but in algebra you do things like substitute a variable into another equation,

297
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,300
or you can divide, or in calculus you can do similar things, but they're more sophisticated,

298
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,300
and these manipulations, I want you to think of the word manipulate like in the spas here in town,

299
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,300
where you have a masseuse who's actually manipulating you,

300
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
and maybe you start mumbling and telling some intimate secrets.

301
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,300
You can get equations to do that.

302
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,300
If you can massage them the right way and get them to relax and open up,

303
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,300
they will tell you amazing things.

304
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Okay, I'm being a little bit silly and metaphorical,

305
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,300
but what's really going on is that these operations of math are really long logical arguments

306
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
that are too long to keep in your head,

307
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,300
but you're applying logic to the equations and transforming them by manipulating them,

308
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,300
and they start to look different, and so Maxwell did this to these four equations that were known,

309
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,300
and he started to see something, he didn't know what he was looking for really,

310
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,300
but at some point he saw something he recognized,

311
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:36,300
which was an equation that describes the spreading of a ripple on a pond.

312
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:44,300
It describes a wave moving, and what is this wave that he's discovering?

313
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,300
He's curious how fast does it move.

314
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
If it's a wave, it's traveling, it has a speed.

315
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,300
He calculates the speed of this wave, and this part I'm just making up,

316
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,300
but I like to imagine him somewhere in Scotland and he's got his candle burning,

317
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,300
and he's calculating, and out comes the speed of these electromagnetic waves,

318
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,300
and they're moving at the speed of light, which is a pretty interesting coincidence.

319
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:14,300
In that moment, unique in human history, Maxwell is the first person to understand what light is.

320
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:21,300
People have thought about light for millennia, but Maxwell understands that light is a propagating wave of electricity and magnetism,

321
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:27,300
dancing together in his Pada da, and each regenerating the other.

322
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:34,300
He has this prediction from calculus and these known physical laws that light can move as an electromagnetic wave,

323
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
and it doesn't have to just be light.

324
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,300
There can be other kinds of non-visible forms of electromagnetic waves.

325
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:47,300
This comes out of his calculations around 1860, so think of the time of the Civil War in the US.

326
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Soon after, Heinrich Hertz observes these predictions that come out of, like Ulam said, scribbling on a blackboard.

327
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Nature is doing something that's respecting the scribbling,

328
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,300
and then Tesla figures out a way to use it to transmit energy wirelessly.

329
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:11,300
This should sound familiar, and then Marconi is sending messages across the Atlantic Ocean with it,

330
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,300
and then you have the 20th century.

331
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:21,300
You have radio and television and telephone and things we take for granted now, but it did come from calculus.

332
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Now, I don't want to say calculus alone did this because I hope I told the story in a way that you're getting it,

333
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,300
that it was essential to have the physicists making their discoveries about electricity and magnetism,

334
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,300
but math was a key supporting player in this drama, specifically calculus.

335
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
I think that you can buy t-shirts now that look like this.

336
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:47,300
Some of you may even own this t-shirt, and God said, and there's Maxwell's equations in vector calculus,

337
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
and there was light.

338
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
It's actually kind of true.

339
00:28:52,300 --> 00:29:01,300
So I sort of think this is what Feynman meant, that the language of electricity and magnetism that God talks is calculus.

340
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,300
This is a specific dialect of calculus, we call vector calculus,

341
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,300
but it doesn't just apply to electricity and magnetism.

342
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:15,300
The same is true if we were talking about how air moves, or water, or how heat diffuses,

343
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,300
or how gravity works, or even in the quantum mechanical realm.

344
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:25,300
All of those phenomena are described by this same sub-dialect of math, differential equations,

345
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,300
a specific kind of use of calculus.

346
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,300
So my argument for the rest of the talk is going to be that calculus matters because of these three things.

347
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:40,300
First, that nature's laws happen to be written in this particular language, calculus,

348
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,300
but that calculus is more than a language, it's a system of reasoning.

349
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Like when Maxwell's doing his mathematical manipulations, he's somehow tapping into the inner logic of the universe.

350
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,300
It's not just playing games with symbols.

351
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Nature is somehow doing the same thing that, I mean I find this really bizarre, so do many other people,

352
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:12,300
that we, with our puny primate logic, happen to have stumbled across something that mirrors the way nature really works,

353
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:19,300
that you can predict stuff that is out there, and then by learning to speak this strange language,

354
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:26,300
and by discovering that it taps into nature's hidden logic, we can use calculus to remake the world.

355
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,300
So that's the gist of the argument here, this is why calculus matters, at least from one point of view.

356
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:39,300
Now, in telling the story of calculus, I want to, at this moment, personify calculus.

357
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,300
I want you to think of it as something that has desires.

358
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Now, if that's too ridiculous, think of it as the practitioners of calculus have desires.

359
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,300
But I'm going to say it this way, what does calculus want, and how does it get what it wants?

360
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,300
So the answer to what it wants, before I tell you what calculus really is,

361
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,300
what calculus wants to do is make hard problems simpler.

362
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,300
And this came as a surprise to my editor, who did not know any math when I was writing this book,

363
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:13,300
but he eventually said to me, I now get it after reading three drafts of the book, I get,

364
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,300
no, I mean he kept telling me do this, do that, I kept changing it, but by the third one he said,

365
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,300
I'm really starting to get what this is.

366
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,300
The books are so fat, the calculus textbooks are so big, because the problems are so hard,

367
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:31,300
but somehow you have found a way, not you, me, but I mean the people that do calculus

368
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,300
have found a way to make very hard problems tractable.

369
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Now, how do they do it?

370
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Okay, so how does calculus get what it wants?

371
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Here's the strategy, it's going to slice hard problems into smaller pieces.

372
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Okay, that might sound familiar.

373
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,300
You know that every good problem solver says if a problem is too hard,

374
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,300
break it down and solve simpler, easier problems first.

375
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Fine, that's a time-honored strategy.

376
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:05,300
But calculus is a maniacal strategy that keeps doing this forever, indefinitely odd infinitum.

377
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,300
So calculus takes this idea of chopping to the infinite limit.

378
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:18,300
It keeps cutting and cutting and cutting and never stops until what's left is an infinite number of infinitesimal pieces.

379
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,300
This is the big idea at the heart of calculus, I'm going to call it the infinity principle,

380
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:31,300
which is that if you cut a problem of a certain class of math or physics problems,

381
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,300
and actually many problems nowadays, even in biology or the social sciences,

382
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:41,300
if you can subdivide it into infinitely many infinitesimal pieces, you have a strategy,

383
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:46,300
which is you're going to solve the problem first for the tiny pieces, and that tends to be easy.

384
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Much easier than the problem originally was.

385
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
So that's why there's hope that this is going to work.

386
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,300
The heart problem is putting the pieces back together. There's no free lunch.

387
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
So that is the challenge in calculus.

388
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,300
Now that you've solved the little problems, how does that tell you about the original big problem?

389
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Well, all right, so we have names for those two parts, the easy and the hard part.

390
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,300
The slicing part is what we call differential calculus, and that's actually easy.

391
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,300
We usually teach that at the beginning of the semester.

392
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,300
The hard part is the putting them back together, integrating everything into a whole,

393
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,300
and that's integral calculus, the rebuilding part.

394
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
All right, so that's our strategy.

395
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:33,300
And so from that point of view, calculus is about this exploitation of the infinity principle.

396
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Now, you'll notice in the way I described what the principle is,

397
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
that you're going to keep cutting and cutting indefinitely,

398
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:46,300
you have to recognize that that's a wild fantasy that you could ever do that in real life.

399
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:53,300
And it has to do with a fantasy that stuff of all kinds is what I'm going to call continuous.

400
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,300
All right, so the infinity principle works nicely for things that are continuous,

401
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,300
to anything that can be sliced finer and finer forever, endlessly.

402
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,300
Those are what I'm going to call continuous, things that hold together,

403
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,300
I mean, from two Latin words that mean holding together.

404
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,300
No smallest parts.

405
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,300
And I want to make sure you understand, since this is a talk about stories,

406
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,300
that in math we tell ourselves stories just like everybody tells themselves stories.

407
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,300
There is an enormous creative fantasy happening right now.

408
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,300
The idea that matter is continuous, we know to be false, right?

409
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
We believe in atoms.

410
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
The word atom means uncuttable.

411
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,300
There are smallest bits.

412
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,300
You might not believe that atoms are the smallest bits,

413
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,300
but we don't really talk about splitting an electron.

414
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,300
We think at some level, matter can't be split farther.

415
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,300
At least that's what the modern physicists tell us.

416
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,300
And not just substance, but even time and space themselves.

417
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
If you listen to people talk about quantum gravity,

418
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,300
a theory that doesn't quite exist yet,

419
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,300
but we're working hard on it.

420
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Once quantum mechanics and gravity are unified properly,

421
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,300
there's a belief that there will be a smallest unit of time and space,

422
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,300
which was already anticipated 100 years ago by Max Planck.

423
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,300
There's something called that if you combine fundamental constants

424
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,300
that control the strength of quantum effects,

425
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
something called H Planck's constant,

426
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,300
something that controls the structure of spacetime, the speed of light, C,

427
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,300
and something that controls the strength of gravity, Newton's constant, G.

428
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,300
There's only one way to combine those three quantities

429
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,300
to make something with the units of length.

430
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,300
Planck realized that, and if you do that, you get the Planck length,

431
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,300
which is 10 to the minus 35 meters approximately,

432
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,300
which is way smaller than an atomic nucleus.

433
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,300
It's way smaller than anything we could measure.

434
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Way smaller.

435
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,300
But there is a feeling that no matter what quantum gravity ends up being,

436
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,300
as a theory, it will have the Planck length in it on dimensional grounds,

437
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,300
and something funky has to happen to space at that scale.

438
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Either it gets pixelated, it's thrashing wildly from quantum jitters.

439
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
We don't know what's going to happen down there,

440
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,300
but it's going to not look smooth and continuous.

441
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
It's going to be weird.

442
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,300
And the same thing for the time it will take for light to travel that distance,

443
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,300
that will be 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

444
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Time is going to get granular or weird.

445
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,300
The point being, nobody in modern physics would tell you

446
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,300
that nature is ultimately smooth and continuous today.

447
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
They may be wrong. I mean, maybe it is.

448
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,300
But our best understanding is that calculus is based on a lie.

449
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,300
The idea that you could keep cutting forever is not true in real life.

450
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Nevertheless, creativity often involves wishful thinking.

451
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,300
We can imagine that we could cut forever, and doing it gives us calculus.

452
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Really, like I say, the most powerful math we've ever thought of as a species.

453
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,300
So appreciating that there is this creative fantasy,

454
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,300
I would say calculus is not the study of derivatives and integrals

455
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
like your teacher might have told you.

456
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,300
It's the study of using the infinity principle systematically

457
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,300
to shed light on any continuous thing.

458
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Any continuous shape, object, motion, phenomenon, process,

459
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,300
anything at all that can be thought of as continuous.

460
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,300
All right, so let me give you some examples of what calculus looks like.

461
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Think of it as having to do, if you had to define it after you leave the lecture

462
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,300
and someone says you went to calculus lecture, what is calculus?

463
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,300
You could say it's the study of continuous change.

464
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,300
That works pretty well, or smooth change.

465
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Or if you don't want adjectives, change.

466
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Calculus is about change.

467
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,300
If you want to get a little more descriptive, it's about things that change direction,

468
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,300
which I would call curves.

469
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Or it's about things that change location, which I would call motion.

470
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Or it's about things that change in some other way, which I would call change.

471
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,300
So curves, motion, and change.

472
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,300
Those are the three obsessions of calculus.

473
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Historically, calculus began with curves.

474
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
That's why I say it grew out of geometry.

475
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:20,300
In the olden days, like Euclid, math of geometry was about straight lines and sharp angles.

476
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,300
The triangles and squares you learned about in elementary geometry.

477
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
But you also learned this.

478
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Okay, now that's a curve.

479
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,300
That's a circle.

480
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Curvy is a thing can be.

481
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:37,300
You probably memorized a formula at some point in your life that the area of a circle is...

482
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
Did anyone know what to say?

483
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Yeah, right? Pi r squared.

484
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Everybody memorizes that for the SATs.

485
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,300
That's a formula involving that amazing number pi,

486
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:56,300
which already gives you a hint that that formula, because pi has those infinitely many digits that never repeat,

487
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,300
there's already a hint of calculus in there with the infinity principle.

488
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Pi is not a creature of geometry.

489
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Pi is actually a creature of calculus.

490
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,300
They snuck calculus into that formula when they told you pi r squared.

491
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Where does that formula come from?

492
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,300
I want to show you an argument that is very close to the argument that Archimedes used

493
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,300
when he discovered and first proved the formula around 250 BC.

494
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,300
I'm reminding you the circumference of a circle, that's the distance around.

495
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,300
The diameter is the distance across through the middle at the widest point.

496
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:36,300
The radius, the r in pi r squared, that would be the distance from the center out to the circle.

497
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,300
The area refers to that green stuff inside, not the distance around, not the circumference.

498
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
We want the area inside a circle.

499
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Here's an argument that will give us the pi r squared using the infinity principle.

500
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:54,300
Watch this. If you've never seen it, I think you're about to have a big epiphany.

501
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,300
If you have seen it, pretend that you're excited.

502
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:04,300
What we're going to do is this dramatic argument where we take the circle and chop it into four pieces.

503
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:11,300
The strategy is, if I could figure out the area of those four pieces, I would know the area of the whole circle.

504
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,300
I'm now going to try to rearrange the pieces into some shape that I recognize,

505
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,300
whose area I will know and that will be the area of the circle.

506
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,300
My first attempt is to make that shape on the bottom that looks like some kind of, I don't know what,

507
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:29,300
a worm or some scalloped shape. It doesn't look promising, but there it is.

508
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,300
If you want to think of it with pizza slices, I put one point down and then one point up, and I've snuggled them together.

509
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,300
The thing I want you to look at is that this distance here is what I'm calling r, the radius of the circle,

510
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,300
because it's the distance from what used to be the center. All these points are at the center.

511
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:52,300
I go from the center out to the curve. That's r, and then this distance along the bottom is half the circumference.

512
00:40:52,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Half the curvy stuff. The circumference is pi times the diameter. We could also say 2 pi times the radius.

513
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Half of that is just pi times the radius, and that's the distance around these curved scallops on the bottom.

514
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,300
The other pi r is up here on the top, making the whole circumference.

515
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:18,300
This is not so helpful at the moment, but now we're going to do like the optometrist does when trying to figure out your prescription.

516
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:27,300
Is this better or worse? Which is better? So what am I doing? I'm going to make eight slices,

517
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,300
and I want you to keep your eye on what happened here, which is that this is still the radius,

518
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,300
and this is still the curvy bottom of total length pi r. Do you see what's happening?

519
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,300
That the shape is starting to look more promising, more recognizable. What if I do it again?

520
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:54,300
Better? Even better. That's now 16 slices, and look, this is practically a parallelogram.

521
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:01,300
It's practically flat. It's not really, it's got little curves, but you can see it's getting flatter and flatter.

522
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Compare what it was like that. This is very bulbous. This is getting flatter, and that's flatter still.

523
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:17,300
Also, let us compare the radius. Look how nearly upright that radius is standing, compared to how tilted that one is, compared to how tilted that one is.

524
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Do you see what's going on? The more you take, the flatter and the more upright it gets.

525
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:31,300
So what do you think happens if I take infinitely many slices, infinitesimally thin? You get that.

526
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:42,300
Now that, you know how to find the area of, because that's a rectangle, and now we're back in classical geometry, so it's just the length times the height, pi r times r, that's pi r squared.

527
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,300
That's actually the reason. So if you have memorized it and never knew why, you now know why.

528
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:56,300
But you had to use calculus. You had to use this idea of taking infinitely many infinitesimal slices to get it, and it's because curves are hard.

529
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,300
We had to get rid of the curves and replace them with straight lines, so that we could use ordinary geometry.

530
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:09,300
And that's the genius of the early creators of calculus, Archimedes and Eudoxus and people like that in ancient Greece.

531
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,300
They were using the infinity principle to do problems like this.

532
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Okay, so now Archimedes, although to us just sounds like another old Greek name, really lives on all around us today.

533
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:32,300
For instance, look at this. If you wanted to represent this head of a mannequin in computer graphics with a smooth bald head and smooth cheeks, you can do what Archimedes did.

534
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:45,300
You take something that's simple shapes analogous to the pizza slices, you could use triangles, and the more you take of them, the finer the mesh, the closer you get to something that looks like a smooth face.

535
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:58,300
And this is commonplace nowadays in computer graphics, like say in this movie Jerry's Game, which was really the first movie with a human character that had lots of expressions and emotions.

536
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:11,300
You can find it at its old five minute movie on YouTube, but it won the best short animated film back in 1998, and Jerry playing chess there in the park is built of millions of polygons.

537
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:17,300
You don't see them, just like you don't notice all the polygons in that smooth mannequin.

538
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:31,300
But going on even better to Shrek with his little trumpety ears or his belly explaining onions have layers to donkey, these creatures don't exist except as meshes of polygons.

539
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:41,300
So it's enormously powerful, this idea of replacing curved shapes with straight shapes by making them infinitesimally small and very plentiful.

540
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:52,300
And so if you just think it's about computer graphics, I want to show you a more serious application of this idea, which is, here's a patient, you may be able to see that his jaw is sticking out.

541
00:44:52,300 --> 00:45:17,300
It's a congenital malformation here, and he went in for cranio facial surgery. The treatment is doctors, the surgeons, are going to take out some of the bones in his jaw and let his whole face heal, and they hope that he will look and feel the way that he wants to look and feel after the surgery.

542
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:24,300
But you don't really get a second chance. You want to predict what's going to happen after the face and the whole head heals.

543
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:32,300
So they first put this guy in a scanner, CT scanner, they get all the details of his bones and everything.

544
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:43,300
And then they have a mathematical model of what will happen with the soft tissues if they replace some bone and they're also taking out cartilage and maybe some, hopefully not too many blood vessels, but whatever.

545
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:53,300
It's complicated surgery, and this mathematical model built on differential equations and calculus tells them where to, it's basically like a flight simulator for surgeons.

546
00:45:53,300 --> 00:46:05,300
So they can do the surgery on a virtual patient ahead of time. And so the model predicted that if they do what they should do, his new face will look like this, and here's his actual new face.

547
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,300
And they could quantify how close they were to the model. It was only ever off by like a millimeter at the most.

548
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:21,300
But what I want to show you is that the model consists of this Archimedean principle of lots of little triangles and polygons, except now in three dimensions.

549
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:33,300
So they have to put in tetrahedra in here underneath the skin, thinking about the whole model of the head, all these various soft tissues with their different elastic properties and stiffnesses and everything.

550
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:41,300
It's all elasticity theory and continuum mechanics built on calculus that makes this surgery possible and so effective.

551
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:55,300
Okay, so saying that calculus is about curves, motion and change, I've talked to you a little about, in case of this guy, the changing appearance and structure of his head.

552
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:02,300
We've talked about the change in Maxwell's equations and predictions of electromagnetic waves and wireless and all that.

553
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:08,300
But in general, curves are very big in data science. You know, that's something we teach our students.

554
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,300
How to represent changing relationships of all kinds in algebra class.

555
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,300
We teach them the X, Y plane and Cartesian coordinates.

556
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,300
The point being that curves are not just curves. Curves are the key to thinking about data.

557
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,300
And we can represent motion and change with curves, visually.

558
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:37,300
So I want to finish with this thought, which has to do with, speaking of motion, let us talk about Usain Bolt.

559
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,300
So Usain Bolt, you may remember, was a wonderful sprinter from Jamaica.

560
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,300
It didn't look like a typical sprinter. He's about six-five.

561
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,300
Usually a sprinter is a pretty compact muscular person.

562
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:56,300
Usain is a very gangly, tall guy, muscular, but very long legs.

563
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:03,300
And he normally was known for running the 200 meters. He was essentially invincible at that distance.

564
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:09,300
But he wanted to also try his hand. I feel like that's the wrong body part.

565
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:16,300
He wanted to try running the 100 meter dash at the Olympics back in Beijing in 2008.

566
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,300
And his coach said, it's not a great idea. You're a 200 meter man. Let's just stick with that.

567
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,300
He said, I want to practice. Let's try the 100.

568
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:32,300
So he ran the 100 meters in competition five times, which is not a lot to be going against the world's best 100 meter runners.

569
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,300
But anyway, he shows up in Beijing and I want to show you what happened on that night.

570
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,300
It's about 10.30 at night. No wind. Very good night to run.

571
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,300
So here's the, as it was called at the time.

572
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:54,300
And so back to 2008 and the Olympic Games in Beijing, the final of the men's 100 meters.

573
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,300
Usain was ready to do his thing.

574
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,300
And now a great start by Richard Thompson in lane four from Trinidad.

575
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,300
And here comes Usain Bolt. Bolt is pulling away. Bolt's looking back.

576
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:12,300
You don't look back in 100 meters. 9.68 is a world record for Usain Bolt.

577
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:18,300
9.68, a new world record, the fastest man in the world.

578
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:24,300
That celebration on the line told the world he could run faster and soon he would.

579
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,300
But it was the Olympic gold medal he really wanted.

580
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,300
If that went by too fast, do you want to watch that again?

581
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,300
That went by pretty fast, okay? 10 seconds. No, well, 9.68 seconds. Watch this again.

582
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,300
So keep your eye on Usain Bolt. He doesn't get the best start.

583
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,300
He was never the best. In fact, he was number seven out of eight coming out of the starting blocks.

584
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:55,300
And so back to 2008 and the Olympic Games in Beijing, the final of the men's 100 meters.

585
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,300
Usain was ready to do his thing.

586
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,300
And off. Great start by Richard Thompson in lane four from Trinidad.

587
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,300
And here comes Usain Bolt. Bolt is pulling away. Bolt's looking back.

588
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:13,300
You don't look back in 100 meters. 9.68 is a world record for Usain Bolt.

589
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:19,300
9.68, a new world record, the fastest man in the world.

590
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:25,300
That celebration on the line told the world he could run faster and soon he would.

591
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,300
But it was the Olympic.

592
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,300
Here, look at this.

593
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,300
Okay, those guys are running like hell.

594
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,300
And Usain Bolt has put his arms down.

595
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,300
You probably can't see it, but his shoelace is untied.

596
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,300
He's a very mischievous guy. He was known as a practical joker.

597
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,300
And he's coasting across the finish line and breaking the world record.

598
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:55,300
He stopped the running with the proper form about 10 or 20 meters before the end.

599
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,300
And he's just goofing around, slapping his chest.

600
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:02,300
He's so excited. I mean, I don't think it was, some people thought it was a little obnoxious.

601
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,300
But I think he was just celebrating. He's a very good natured guy.

602
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,300
Didn't mean any disrespect.

603
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:13,300
But anyway, the question became in the sports world, what if he had run hard all the way?

604
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,300
I mean, he already broke the world record with 9.68.

605
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,300
How fast could he have run so we could analyze this with math?

606
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:26,300
They have little recording devices every 10 meters down the track that measures his split time.

607
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,300
What time did he cross this 10 meters and the next 10 meters?

608
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,300
And from those data, we get this graph.

609
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,300
So here's his distance down the track as a function of time.

610
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,300
And you can see at the beginning, well, all right, let me be honest about this.

611
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,300
I actually only have these dots. That's what we know.

612
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,300
We also have the tape, but it's hard to tell from the tape.

613
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,300
There's a lot of distortion in the footage.

614
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,300
It's not so easy to really know exactly what's happening.

615
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:00,300
But you can fit a smooth curve through the dots by various statistical techniques,

616
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,300
which, by the way, use calculus, something called linear regression.

617
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:09,300
So you can estimate, excuse me, in a good way, a reasonable smooth curve through there

618
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,300
with the further constraint that its slope at the beginning should be zero,

619
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
because we know he had zero speed coming out of the blocks.

620
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
He's motionless at first.

621
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,300
So if you fit a curve with those constraints, you can then look at the slope at every point on that curve,

622
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,300
and that will tell you his speed instant by instant, and it looks like this.

623
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,300
You see the message there?

624
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,300
It's what you saw visually. It's very obvious.

625
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,300
He's picking up speed.

626
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,300
His peak speed was around 27 miles an hour.

627
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,300
This is when he's pulling away.

628
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,300
Then he's still accelerating, and then he starts slapping his chest and fooling around,

629
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,300
and he's slowing down.

630
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,300
So what would happen if he kept going?

631
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,300
All right.

632
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,300
So we could do that extrapolation, but actually we don't have to,

633
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:58,300
because a few months later was the world championship in Berlin.

634
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,300
And this time, the scientists were ready.

635
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,300
So they put little reflecting dots on the back of everything,

636
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:09,300
so they put little reflecting dots on the back of every runner,

637
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:15,300
and were shining sort of like the radar guns that the police would use to see if you're speeding.

638
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,300
I think they might actually have been laser guns,

639
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:25,300
but in any case, they could record 100 times per second where the runner was for each of the runners.

640
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,300
And so that's a very precise measurement, and here's what the data...

641
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,300
Oh, he broke the world record again.

642
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,300
I think it was now 9.58.

643
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,300
And so here's the data.

644
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:40,300
Now, what do you think all those wiggles are?

645
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,300
This is the wiggles of the actual data.

646
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,300
Do you know what those are?

647
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,300
Those are actually steps.

648
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,300
Breathing is an interesting guess.

649
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,300
Yeah, those are steps.

650
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:54,300
When you run, you're leaping and landing, and doing that again.

651
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,300
And in Usain Bolt's case, he does it 41 times.

652
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,300
Everybody else does 45 steps.

653
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,300
I told you he has long legs.

654
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:07,300
So he runs 41 steps in the 100 meters, and there's 41 wiggles in here.

655
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,300
And what I find interesting about this, and I want to leave you with this thought,

656
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,300
is that we don't really care about that.

657
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,300
That's not interesting, the wiggle.

658
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:22,300
I mean, yes, it's slightly interesting that his speed varies during a single foot cycle.

659
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:28,300
But what we're really interested in is the trend, the average that's going through here, these dots.

660
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,300
And so I want that to be kind of a little parable for you,

661
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,300
that sometimes if you get too detailed in your science,

662
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,300
you might start measuring stuff you're not actually interested in.

663
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,300
And I think that calculus is like that.

664
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,300
That when we take this approximation that we can cut things infinitely finally,

665
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
it's not really true.

666
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,300
At the finest scale, there's quantum jitters and other things that we don't care about.

667
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:57,300
Calculus is capturing the trend of reality over a tremendous number of orders of magnitude

668
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,300
of space and time and substance and everything.

669
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,300
And it's based on a lie, but it's capturing something true.

670
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:12,300
And so I think it's very well said by Picasso, art is a lie that makes us realize truth.

671
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,300
So I really do think that's the lesson, that is the story of calculus.

672
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,300
Thank you.

673
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,300
Thanks.

674
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,300
I see some microphones going around.

675
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,300
Are we doing questions here?

676
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,300
Oh, I would love to take questions if people would like.

677
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,300
So there are some microphones available.

678
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,300
If you just stand up or wave your hand, they'll come find you.

679
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,300
Yes, okay.

680
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,300
There are two of us, so try to get either of our attention.

681
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:03,300
Did you figure out how fast the world record would have been in those 2008 Olympics?

682
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,300
Well, it's a very good question. I did set that up.

683
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,300
Right, so we should probably really do the calculation I suggested.

684
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,300
Imagine if I extrapolated without the slowing down, what would he have run on that night?

685
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,300
I honestly haven't done it. It's a good question.

686
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,300
Could he have done even better than the 9.58?

687
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,300
I don't know. I haven't done the calculation. I should. It's a good question.

688
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,300
I have the data.

689
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:31,300
So we could just ignore the last few data points and then draw a straight line.

690
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,300
It's a good question. I'm sorry, I don't know.

691
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,300
Yes, there's a question over on the far left.

692
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:47,300
Can calculus be used in the research of cancer?

693
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,300
Calculus is being used constantly in cancer research.

694
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:57,300
Sure, yeah, I mean, we have mathematical models of various types,

695
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,300
so you can talk about the, for instance, the growth of a tumor has been modeled

696
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,300
with so-called partial differential equations.

697
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:09,300
There are questions about optimal dosing of chemotherapy,

698
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,300
or suppose you have several chemotherapy drugs that might work,

699
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,300
but if you just use one for too long, the patient develops resistance to it.

700
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,300
So is there an optimal way to trade off between a few different drugs?

701
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,300
I have a colleague, Dr. Jake Scott at Cleveland Clinic, who's doing exactly that,

702
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,300
using a branch of math called Optimal Control Theory,

703
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:34,300
which builds on calculus ideas from a subfield called Calculus of Variations.

704
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,300
So yeah, I mean, there's a lot of calculus.

705
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,300
There's even a field now called Mathematical Oncology,

706
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:45,300
which you could definitely look up and find practitioners.

707
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,300
Yes, yes, there's a question.

708
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,300
Hi, this is not your point exactly,

709
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:08,300
but I'm wondering how if time and space are not infinitely divisible,

710
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,300
Zeno's paradoxes get resolved,

711
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:15,300
and so I'm thinking particularly about the paradox of the flying arrow,

712
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:22,300
in which if it's in a moment of time at a certain point,

713
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,300
and then in the next moment of time at another point,

714
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,300
there's no motion between those,

715
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,300
and so it seems impossible for the arrow to move,

716
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,300
and Aristotle's resolution is just that you can keep dividing them,

717
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,300
and there's no real end.

718
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,300
Well, thank you for that question about Zeno's paradoxes.

719
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,300
I think you summarized the paradox of the arrow very well,

720
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:52,300
and I write about them at some length in infinite powers,

721
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,300
and I feel, I'll tell you what my take on them is,

722
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,300
but keep in mind that people have been arguing about Zeno's paradoxes

723
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:03,300
for about 2,500 years now,

724
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,300
so I don't claim that I've outdone Zeno or Aristotle

725
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,300
or Bertrand Russell or anyone in between,

726
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:14,300
but my take, one thing is, we don't have Zeno's writings.

727
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:20,300
We only know what Zeno was saying because of what Plato said about him

728
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,300
or Aristotle said about him,

729
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,300
and these were people who weren't predisposed toward treating Zeno kindly.

730
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,300
They bring him up to demolish him,

731
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,300
so I don't know that I trust their version of his paradoxes,

732
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,300
but as far as we can tell, he had at least four paradoxes,

733
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,300
which were structured like this.

734
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,300
Two paradoxes are supposed space and time are infinitely subdivisible,

735
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,300
and two of them are supposed the opposite,

736
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,300
supposed space and time are fundamentally particulate and discreet,

737
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,300
and then he has paradoxes for every occasion.

738
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:58,300
So the paradox of the arrow is under the premise that space and time are particulate,

739
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,300
that there's a particular moment in time,

740
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,300
and the arrow is at a particular location,

741
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,300
and then click on one of those digital clocks

742
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,300
that the second hand doesn't sweep continuously,

743
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,300
it goes tick, tick, tick, right?

744
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:17,300
That's the picture of time in Zeno's paradox of the arrow,

745
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:22,300
and under that paradox, at the next tick, the arrow's in a new place.

746
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,300
It has just materialized in a new location

747
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,300
without traversing the space in between

748
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,300
because, by assumption, there is no space in between.

749
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,300
Space is particulate.

750
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,300
So motion in a universe that is particulate

751
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,300
is doing exactly what Zeno said it would do, and there's no paradox.

752
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:43,300
He has described the way things would be in such a universe,

753
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,300
and the fact that we don't like it

754
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,300
is because we perceive space and time as being continuous,

755
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,300
but I don't think Zeno's paradox of the arrow is wrong.

756
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,300
I think it's logically correct.

757
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,300
So anyone who says that paradox is wrong

758
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,300
and tries to argue it with calculus

759
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,300
is not understanding Zeno's reasoning.

760
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,300
He's perfectly right about that.

761
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,300
Where he's not right is in the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise

762
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,300
or the dichotomy paradox.

763
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,300
Those are paradoxes, like the dichotomy paradox is,

764
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,300
I can't walk from here to there because before I get there,

765
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,300
I have to walk half the distance,

766
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,300
and I can't walk half the distance

767
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,300
because before I do that, I have to walk half of that.

768
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,300
You're always splitting in half.

769
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:29,300
Meanwhile, everyone does that every day.

770
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,300
They get out of bed and go eat breakfast, so we can do it.

771
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,300
So there's the paradox.

772
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,300
How can it be possible to do an infinite number of these things

773
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,300
before breakfast?

774
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,300
Zeno had trouble thinking about infinite sums

775
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,300
that converged to a finite thing

776
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,300
because that math was not really well developed at that point.

777
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,300
So I think Zeno is wrong about the...

778
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,300
If space and time are continuous, I think his paradoxes are faulty,

779
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:00,300
but I think his paradox of the arrow is correctly reasoned.

780
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,300
Stephen, over here.

781
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,300
Yes, please.

782
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,300
Thank you.

783
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:16,300
Calculus involves an infinite number of sums of infinite decimals,

784
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:25,300
and the universe has, beginning with Max Planck,

785
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:33,300
perhaps an invisibly small quantities of length and distance and so forth.

786
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:39,300
But as far as I understand, a fundamentally open question is

787
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,300
whether the universe itself is infinite or finite.

788
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:49,300
So can we use calculus to make predictions that are observable

789
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:55,300
through cosmology of whether our universe is finite or infinite?

790
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,300
Very interesting.

791
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,300
So to think about the infinitely big, not the infinitesimally small,

792
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,300
and in the case of cosmology.

793
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,300
First of all, I'm not an expert in that,

794
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:12,300
so I wouldn't presume to give you a clear answer on it.

795
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,300
I don't know what to say.

796
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,300
I mean, I think it's...

797
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:19,300
Well, what do our scientists tell us today that...

798
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,300
I mean, you see different things.

799
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,300
They tell us that the universe is 13.8 billion years old or something,

800
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:31,300
and a naive calculation would tell you so it should be 13.8 times...

801
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,300
You know, that many light years across in radius,

802
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,300
but then I'm told by my cosmology friends,

803
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,300
no, that's not right.

804
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:43,300
90 billion light years are some kind of crazy big number.

805
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,300
You don't just... because of something about inflation.

806
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,300
So I can't say I ever really understood that argument.

807
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,300
And then others will say, well, that's only just the visible universe

808
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:56,300
that we get from the cosmic microwave background and other data.

809
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,300
So if we really believe that that's just the visible universe,

810
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:04,300
but there's more stuff, like in a scenario where there's lots of bubble universes

811
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,300
that are causally decoupled from us,

812
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,300
conceivably it could be infinite.

813
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,300
I think there are respectable models that have infinite universes

814
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,300
in both time and space.

815
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,300
So I don't think calculus can answer that.

816
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,300
I think there are also respectable ones that are finite

817
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,300
that have big bang and big crunch pulsating universes.

818
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,300
So I don't think calculus can answer that one for us.

819
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,300
I don't see any logical contradiction in either of those.

820
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:36,300
It's up to the physicists and the cosmologists to take care of that one for us.

821
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,300
I saw some people nodding.

822
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,300
So I hope that was reasonably close to what science would say today.

823
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,300
I'm an amateur on that field.

824
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,300
Okay, we'll start here, and then Denise will cover that one.

825
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,300
Okay, good. Great questions.

826
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,300
How about the 1980 article about Wigner

827
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,300
about the unreasonable association of mathematics and natural science?

828
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,300
I'm not sure that's the correct title, but I think it's close.

829
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,300
Yeah, very close.

830
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,300
What was the question? Just you want my comments on Wigner's article?

831
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,300
The comments on that article.

832
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:16,300
Yeah, so Eugene Wigner, great scientist of one of the great Hungarian Jewish geniuses

833
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:22,300
that, along with people like von Neumann and Leo Zellart,

834
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,300
had this fantastic article from around 1960

835
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:31,300
that's called on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences.

836
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,300
I think that's the title.

837
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,300
The ringing phrase is on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.

838
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,300
So that's the question. Is it unreasonable or not?

839
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,300
Some people say, what's unreasonable?

840
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,300
The people who are big on the language point of view will say,

841
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,300
math is the language that we use to describe nature.

842
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,300
Why should we be surprised that it describes nature?

843
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,300
So they don't get it. They don't get what Wigner is talking about.

844
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:02,300
I think it's because those people don't know enough science, actually, or enough math.

845
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:08,300
The deeper you go, I mean, let me try to capture what Wigner is talking about.

846
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,300
Here's an example.

847
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:16,300
We have this theory that goes beyond quantum theory,

848
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:21,300
where in traditional quantum theory the electric and magnetic field are treated classically,

849
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,300
but other parts are treated quantum mechanically.

850
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,300
But if you quantize the electromagnetic field,

851
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,300
then you have this fancier theory called quantum electrodynamics, QED,

852
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,300
that Feynman worked on and others worked on.

853
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:39,300
In QED, we have certain calculations about quantities in physics,

854
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,300
something called the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron.

855
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,300
G-2 is the little formula for it.

856
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,300
It's not a very physically important quantity,

857
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:53,300
but it's interesting as a poster child for how good math can be in describing reality.

858
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,300
We can calculate this G-2 to, I think,

859
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:04,300
the current record is something like 12 digits after the decimal point.

860
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,300
One part in a trillion accuracy or something like that.

861
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:13,300
Does that spook you?

862
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,300
It should.

863
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:19,300
That math that is, according to some people, just a free creation of human imagination,

864
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:26,300
is matching click, click, click, click, click, click, click for 12 digits worth of what nature is doing.

865
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,300
So it's like nature knows math,

866
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,300
but really not just geometry, not just straight lines and stuff.

867
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,300
This is a very fancy part of math that seems like it's built in.

868
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,300
I don't know if that's the best example.

869
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,300
Maybe it's too arcane, that example.

870
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:49,300
Anyway, it's a feeling of awe that, certainly Einstein expressed in that famous saying

871
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:54,300
about the eternal mystery of the universe is that it's comprehensible.

872
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:59,300
He often quoted us the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.

873
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:06,300
So Einstein certainly felt it, and people like Dirac,

874
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:12,300
another example would be Dirac working in this area of quantum,

875
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,300
I mean it's a precursor to quantum electrodynamics.

876
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:20,300
He writes down a thing called the Dirac equation that merges special relativity with quantum theory,

877
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,300
the existence of something called antimatter,

878
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:29,300
that there should be in addition to an electron some exact bizarro world version of the electron

879
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:34,300
that has the same mass and the same charge except it's positive instead of negative.

880
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:39,300
And it had never been seen, and he just imagined it and the equations conjured it up and said it should be there.

881
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:43,300
And Dirac, very dry in his British way says something like,

882
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:48,300
would be curious or it would be surprising if nature did not make use of,

883
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,300
but it's sort of like, this math is so pretty you'd expect nature to do it.

884
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:59,300
And then a few years later, it's measured, there is a positron, you can find it, it's a real thing.

885
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:04,300
And today it's used in PET scanning if you've heard of people going in for sensitive kinds of magnetic imaging,

886
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,300
PET scanning, that's positron emission tomography.

887
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:15,300
So it's wild, the math conjured that thing out of nothingness, it was there waiting to be discovered.

888
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:21,300
I don't know what to say, so for me, yes, it's a profoundly practically religious feeling.

889
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:28,300
Like if I were inclined to believe in God, I would think this would be evidence, but I'm not.

890
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:33,300
But I don't know how to explain why math works so well at describing the universe.

891
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,300
It's confusing, I mean there could be circularity in the argument,

892
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:41,300
it could be that I'm only bringing up the cases where math works well.

893
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:44,300
So of course it works well in those cases.

894
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:48,300
I don't know, these are really deep questions.

895
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,300
Okay, here's a question.

896
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,300
Hi.

897
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,300
Oh yes please, go ahead.

898
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,300
I'm sorry, I saw a gentleman here in the middle, but go ahead.

899
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,300
My head is really exploding.

900
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,300
Your head's exploding, is that good?

901
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,300
Yes, that's it.

902
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,300
Okay, okay.

903
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:10,300
But just recently I've been listening to compositions by Carl Jenkins.

904
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,300
Could you hold your mic up a little closer?

905
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,300
Carl Jenkins, and they always talk about him being a mathematician.

906
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:19,300
I'm not a mathematician, I'm not a musician.

907
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:24,300
But 50 years ago, I also read Hermann Hesse and Magistral Ludi,

908
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:29,300
a glass bead game, and the connection between math and music.

909
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:36,300
So do you have any comments from the perspective of...

910
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,300
Is the question about the relation between math and music,

911
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,300
or between math and playing games?

912
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:46,300
No, it's math and music, and the patterns.

913
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,300
Do you have any insight there that you'd like to share with us?

914
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,300
I don't have much to say.

915
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,300
Certainly there's some kind of profound connection.

916
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
Certainly a lot of...

917
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,300
It's often pointed out that a few things,

918
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:02,300
that mathematicians are often particularly entranced with music.

919
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,300
There are plenty of musicians who are not that fond of math.

920
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,300
So that's not like a simple identification.

921
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,300
Leibniz has some quote that I can't remember exactly what it is,

922
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:17,300
but something like about that music is the soul.

923
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,300
Does someone remember the quote?

924
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,300
Music is math of the soul.

925
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,300
It's something about the...

926
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,300
Oh, do you have it?

927
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,300
Music is the soul of the last class.

928
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,300
Oh, please put the mic on her.

929
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,300
I love it.

930
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,300
Are you from St. John's?

931
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Yeah.

932
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,300
This you see?

933
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,300
This is the kind of education you get at St. John's.

934
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,300
Please give us a quote.

935
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,300
So if I remember correct, Leibniz says music is the mind,

936
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,300
like, mathematicizing or calculating unconsciously.

937
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,300
And then Schopenhauer says music is the mind,

938
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,300
philosophizing unconsciously.

939
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,300
Nice.

940
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:01,300
So that's an interesting possible thought that...

941
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,300
Beautiful, thank you very much.

942
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,300
That is music the mind.

943
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,300
What is it?

944
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,300
Mathematizing unconsciously.

945
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,300
Certainly there's something about time and rhythm and pattern,

946
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,300
but it's a confusing question because math is...

947
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:22,300
I mean, music is so much more capable of moving us emotionally.

948
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,300
Math can move us in a certain way,

949
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,300
but it's not the same as listening to...

950
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,300
Right, even those of us who love math.

951
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,300
I have clapped at beautiful math.

952
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,300
I've never started weeping, but I could really get transported.

953
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,300
Well, not for that reason.

954
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,300
I don't know.

955
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,300
There's something very transporting.

956
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:45,300
Music feels transcendent in a different way than math is,

957
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,300
but other just random connections,

958
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,300
since you asked me what are my thoughts.

959
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,300
I'm also thinking of prodigies,

960
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:57,300
that the fields that have prodigies, math,

961
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:01,300
right, child prodigies, math, music,

962
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,300
the three-year-old Mozart, and chess.

963
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,300
And there may be some others,

964
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,300
but it's hard to be a great historian at two.

965
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:14,300
So some fields, especially fields that are about patterns,

966
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,300
subtle perceptions of patterns,

967
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,300
appreciation of symmetry pattern, things like that,

968
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:23,300
that are often outside of language or experience,

969
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,300
I mean spoken verbal language.

970
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,300
I don't know.

971
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:30,300
It's interesting to me that math and music and chess are those three.

972
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,300
There may be others, but I don't know.

973
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,300
I don't have that much to say about it.

974
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,300
Thank you.

975
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,300
Yeah, good question though.

976
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,300
Oh, yes, please.

977
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,300
Go ahead.

978
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:42,300
I have a chicken or the egg kind of a question for you.

979
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:51,300
Would any of the sciences or most of mathematics

980
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:57,300
be possible without the analysis of infinite series?

981
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,300
Aha.

982
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:04,300
So you're saying that the tool that we call infinite series

983
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,300
or the mathematical concept of infinite series,

984
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,300
would what be possible without it?

985
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,300
Everything else.

986
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,300
Higher math or something?

987
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,300
Well, the sciences.

988
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,300
The sciences.

989
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:17,300
How much of the sciences depends on the use of infinite series?

990
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,300
Calculus, it seems to me.

991
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,300
Calculus, yeah.

992
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,300
It very much uses infinite series.

993
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,300
I think it's kind of a basis of...

994
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,300
They're important for sure.

995
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,300
They're very important.

996
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:33,300
They're one strategy of using the infinity principle.

997
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,300
I wouldn't say that they're the only strategy,

998
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:42,300
but Newton used infinite series very much in his first development of calculus.

999
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,300
Then he later created fluctuations,

1000
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,300
which were based on analogies with motion and time,

1001
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,300
and then ultimately he did a geometric version of calculus

1002
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,300
that is in the Principia where he's trying to persuade people

1003
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,300
with what looks like Euclidean rigor,

1004
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,300
except it has a lot of infinitesimal arguments in it.

1005
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,300
So he certainly used infinite series a lot.

1006
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,300
It's worth pointing out.

1007
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,300
I've only mentioned European scientists so far

1008
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,300
with Maxwell and Ersted and Company,

1009
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:18,300
but let's not forget that in India there were people like Madhava

1010
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,300
around 1300 or 1400,

1011
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:24,300
so fully more than 200 years before Newton and Leibniz,

1012
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:28,300
working with the infinite series that you like so much.

1013
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:34,300
So Madhava came up with infinite series for sine and cosine

1014
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,300
and arc tangent for astronomical reasons.

1015
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:41,300
These are the great Hindu mathematicians of Kerala, India,

1016
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,300
big tradition in math and astronomy.

1017
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:47,300
You've got to appreciate that calculus is world culture.

1018
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,300
The Arabic mathematicians did a lot.

1019
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,300
I would single out a guy named Ibn al-Haitham,

1020
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,300
often called Alhazen in the West.

1021
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:03,300
Very important work also using infinite series and sums generally.

1022
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:08,300
He could do integrals or find volumes that Archimedes didn't know how to do.

1023
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,300
Anyway, I know that we often tell it very Eurocentric,

1024
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,300
but I think the truth is the European mathematicians

1025
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,300
put the finishing touches on calculus,

1026
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,300
but a lot of it was developed elsewhere in the world.

1027
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,300
First, the sake of honesty, let me say this definition

1028
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,300
I've given about the infinity principle,

1029
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,300
that that's the heart of calculus,

1030
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,300
that's a singular point of view, that is not widely shared.

1031
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,300
I believe it's right, but most historians will tell you calculus

1032
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:43,300
is a phenomenon of Germany and England in the 1600s

1033
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,300
from Leibniz and Newton,

1034
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,300
in particular the discovery of the thing called the fundamental theorem of calculus,

1035
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:53,300
which connects the two parts, the differential and integral part of calculus,

1036
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,300
and lets us do things like infinite sums

1037
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:00,300
through a certain trick that is called the anti-derivative,

1038
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:02,300
that makes the calculations much easier

1039
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,300
and you don't have to be a genius of the caliber of Archimedes or Ibn al-Haitham.

1040
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:10,300
Now you can teach that calculus to ordinary school children

1041
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:14,300
of no particular great intellect and they can do it,

1042
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,300
which they could never do in Archimedean argument.

1043
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,300
We've made calculus so streamlined and so easy,

1044
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,300
maybe not you didn't think so when you took it,

1045
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,300
but believe me it's much easier now than it was.

1046
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:29,300
That's what most historians would tell you is the beginning of calculus,

1047
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,300
but I just think that's wrong.

1048
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:35,300
I think that's the culmination of 2,000 years of great work.

1049
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,300
Shall we take one last question?

1050
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:53,300
So going back to your example with the area of a circle,

1051
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,300
one thing you took for granted was pi.

1052
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,300
Oh yes.

1053
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,300
So I was just curious how Archimedes, whoever it was,

1054
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,300
that was deriving this initially, what method they used.

1055
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,300
Sure, great question, yeah.

1056
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:12,300
So right, I took for granted the pi in the calculation, the number pi, 3.14, etc.

1057
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:18,300
So Archimedes absolutely gave a very systematic way of thinking about the number pi,

1058
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:25,300
where he tried to, so in the same little manuscript or treatise

1059
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,300
where he's calculated an area of a circle,

1060
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,300
he also calculates the circumference, though he doesn't think of it as a,

1061
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:35,300
I mean it's interesting, to him pi is not a number.

1062
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,300
That's a whole complicated story.

1063
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:40,300
But he looks at a ratio, he's very interested in proportions, right?

1064
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,300
You know the Greeks think a lot about proportions.

1065
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:49,300
And for him, he looks at the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter,

1066
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:55,300
and he does it by putting in shapes that he understands that have straight sides,

1067
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,300
like a square, actually what he starts with is a hexagon,

1068
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,300
that almost looks like a circle, sitting inside the circle,

1069
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:05,300
and another hexagon sitting outside the circle, tangent to the circle,

1070
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,300
the inscribed and circumscribed hexagon.

1071
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,300
And then he systematically doubles the number of sides,

1072
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:13,300
so he goes from a 6-gon to a 12-gon to a 24-gon.

1073
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:18,300
And you can picture as you add more and more corners to these polygons,

1074
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,300
they start to look more and more like a real circle.

1075
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:25,300
And he could calculate an iterative formula if he knows the area,

1076
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,300
knows the circumference for a 6-gon,

1077
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,300
it gives him the formula for the 12-gon,

1078
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:33,300
and he works his way up till he eventually gets to the 96-gon,

1079
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,300
and he shows that pi, this is a great formula,

1080
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:41,300
he shows what we would today call pi is trapped between two numbers.

1081
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:48,300
It's between the number 3 and 10 seventieths and 3 and 10 over 71,

1082
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:52,300
which is cool because the 70 and the 71 are right next to each other.

1083
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,300
So it's between 3 and 10 seventieths,

1084
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,300
which you might recognize as 3 and 1 seventh,

1085
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:01,300
or 22 sevenths, which a lot of people mistakenly think is equal to pi.

1086
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,300
That's not correct, it's a bound on pi,

1087
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,300
but that's Archimedes bound, 22 sevenths.

1088
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,300
And then the other bound, which is a smaller, that's an upper bound,

1089
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:15,300
and the smaller number, 3 plus 10 over 71, is a lower bound,

1090
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,300
and pi is somehow trapped in between those two numbers.

1091
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:22,300
So he does it by these inscribed and circumscribed 96-gons,

1092
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:27,300
and it requires a lot of detailed approximations of square roots

1093
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,300
using rational numbers that are still, people are debating,

1094
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,300
how did he do it exactly, because he doesn't show his work.

1095
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,300
Teachers out there, I know some of you are teachers,

1096
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,300
see there's Beth, right, you would have taken off for Archimedes,

1097
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,300
didn't show all his work.

1098
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,300
Yeah, so we don't exactly know,

1099
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:47,300
but he was a wizard with those approximations of fractions

1100
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,300
of square roots and things,

1101
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,300
but he got everything is right that he said.

1102
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,300
If you don't appreciate Archimedes, he's really fantastic.

1103
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:59,300
I would put him in the top three or four of all time in math,

1104
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:04,300
he's really something with Newton and Riemann and Gauss,

1105
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:08,300
those are really, but oiler too, those are like my top five.

1106
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:12,300
For what it's worth.

1107
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,300
Can we have another round of applause for Steve?

1108
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,300
Thank you.
