1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
He wasn't established a long time, his long career career back then is five.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,520
He works on a whole bunch of physical principles related to origins of life,

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,000
pro-cells, after biology. It was his pleasure to have him here today, PhD.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,520
Thank you. Yeah, it's certainly also, it's always wonderful to be back here and

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,440
nice to see a number of known faces and some new ones too.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,680
Some of you know that I've been a bit obsessed with,

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,640
we're trying to create life in the lab for many years.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,280
When I was younger, I thought I'd be long done by now, but it's not so easy.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,920
So what I'll present here today is our latest work on computational work, theoretical work,

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,280
on the missing link to actually implement a living system in the lab.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,280
And I want to emphasize my collaborators here, and we have Christopher Thompson

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,720
and Marco Toccio. They are two recent graduate students I've had, and you guys

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,760
of course know Artemis. He's been here for a long time at SFI.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
Hansiak is an old friend from Los Alamos and Didliu.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,640
Bornebush is also one of my previous graduate students.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,640
So, I'll focus on the question of how to get information into a self-replicating

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,920
molecular machine. This has been an issue we haven't been able to solve experimentally yet.

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,200
So, if I can figure out, and it doesn't work this year,

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:47,920
I can also use this one here. So, I think that most of us would agree that

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,200
if we want to have a transition from non-living to living matter,

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:02,240
then it has to be characterized by the origin of some functional information that can

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:10,400
tell how to build this living matter. So, the goal is to demonstrate how particular

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,960
molecular reaction networks they can generate and store this kind of information.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
I guess it looks smart, but it isn't.

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:35,280
So, my answer is to start with a metabolism. I think this is really the key, and I'll try to

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,880
argue for that, because there's still some discussion in the community about

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,360
what came first, the chicken on the egg here. It's clear that energy is needed and information

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
is needed. There has to be some kind of containment also, but I really think that

29
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:00,160
one should focus on the energetics in the beginning. So, imagine we have an energy gradient,

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,400
some free energy available. We can then use this free energy to turn resources into building blocks,

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,480
and the key is to have a catalyst that can be in more than one state. So, there can be a selection

32
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,440
of catalysts if these building blocks, they will actually also be, or one or more of them,

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,800
will be catalysts. So, we are in a situation where we provide energy from the environment,

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,960
so we start with resources, and then we end up with building blocks. Of course, the desired

35
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,440
situation is that we lift our building blocks up, so we get more complex building blocks that are

36
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:48,400
energetically higher up, but it's also okay if we can just make new materials by this process.

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,160
And of course, this is not clear why this is true, at least some people say it is not clear.

38
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,800
So, therefore, I've tried to state two questions here. Why focus on metabolism? Is metabolism

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,600
really primary to information since our topic is mainly information? And how is a good metabolic

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:18,160
catalyst selected and up-concentrated if you have a system like this here? Free energy available,

41
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,560
you use this energy to turn resources into building blocks, where one of the building blocks is

42
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:31,520
actually a catalyst that can catalyze its own formation. So, we have an order catalysis. And

43
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:40,640
for some of you, this is, you already know that, but I want to emphasize that if we look at a molecular

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:49,440
system that has different states, let's see that it has w different states, then we know from Boltzmann

45
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,040
that it can encode information to the amount of the equation of PIS, which is information is equal

46
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:08,560
to Boltzmann's constant and the natural logarithm of the possible states. And there is information

47
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,560
represented many places in living systems, the most well-known sequential equation, DNA, RNA,

48
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,640
proteins and so forth. But I want to emphasize that information can also be present as conformational

49
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:32,320
information where an aggregate can be composed of different components and then the how many

50
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,160
components and in high concentrations will also represent the information. This is the one Lancet

51
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,960
that has introduced that and sequential information like we have in DNA and RNA and proteins, etc.

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,160
That's a particular kind of compositional information. Compositional information is more

53
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:08,480
general. So if we take Boltzmann's equation and the fundamental first law or sorry second law

54
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:17,040
where we have that information or entropy here is equal to energy divided by t and then we insert

55
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:27,440
this fundamental equation from thermodynamics into Boltzmann's equation. We get an equation we see

56
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:37,520
here where we can eliminate or we can isolate e and then we get in a system where there are two

57
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,800
states, we get an energy that is this big. And this was Landau that I think was first in pointing

58
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:54,720
out that if you want to delete or create or store a bit of information there has to be

59
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:05,200
it costs you something and the cost is about if you put in the room temperature and the value

60
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:12,640
for the Boltzmann constant you get a small amount of energy. And I think this is a physics argument

61
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:24,240
for why one has to look at free energy before one can think about information. And this is of

62
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:34,000
course in line with all of our experiences whenever we have to write something we have to use energy

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,440
computers use energy transmission of information on cables and you know

64
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,480
satellites and what all of this is something we already know very well.

65
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Oh biological systems they also require energy to the replication machinery is energetically

66
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,520
it needs energy. Can I ask you a question? Yeah yeah absolutely. So

67
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,560
it's interesting that you're using Landau's principle as this you know the argument for why

68
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,840
we need a metabolism. I mean I agree with all this but I just as far as I know I agree real

69
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,000
metabolism is many orders of magnitude above that in the amount of heat it releases per bit.

70
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,280
And so is that an indication that actually some other mechanism is making the metabolism

71
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:43,360
necessary than Landau's principle? No no this is just this is just to state I mean you guys most

72
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:51,680
of you are it's sort of you know preaching to the choir but for many people in the community

73
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,880
that are interested in these things it's not obvious and it'll be contested but I

74
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,520
know I think I know that I mean you need to use about two electron volts to split water

75
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:12,880
so you need much more energy to do to run chemical reactions and how exactly how the

76
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,480
relationship is between how much energy you have to to process or to run a chemical process

77
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,880
compared to how much information there is I I'll not get into that here. I'll sort of try to

78
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,360
put these two things together at the end. Yeah the ribosome which is running all these strings

79
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
is about four times off the Landauer bound so it's real and then that machine is about half

80
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
of cellular metabolism in bacteria so that's where one of these costs actually does get

81
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,760
scaled all the way up to sort of cellular scale. It's only about four times that? It's four times

82
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,920
that. Oh no I thought it was yeah hundreds or thousands of times. No no no it's not no

83
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,240
but it but it is I mean we have I don't think anybody has actually reached the this limit

84
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:11,280
has that been done I don't think so anyways so let's believe that we need to have free energy

85
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:20,160
before we can have information and so then if that's true then we can go to the next question

86
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,040
how is a metabolic catalyst selected and up concentrated because now we we agree that we

87
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:35,280
actually need free energy to generate this catalyst and I will I'll claim that a catalyst

88
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,760
is a sufficient condition for having a catalyst is that you have an energy transducer and a

89
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:51,520
combinatorial cofactor in chemistry you have you have catalyst that speed up chemical processes

90
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,720
and and if you have an energy transducer that's a that's a molecular machine that can turn

91
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,760
one kind of energy into another kind of energy we're going to focus on how we can turn light

92
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,920
energy into chemical energy and this can be modulated with a so-called cofactor and I'll get

93
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:19,840
into that later so we so that's number one we actually require or assume that this catalyst

94
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,520
is composed of an energy transducer and a combinatorial cofactor that can modulate it

95
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:36,560
and a cofactor can be it does need to but it can be an an electron donor or an electron receptor

96
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,840
depending on how the system is made up so that depending on how how well it donates electrons

97
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,400
to to this energy transduction machinery the process will run faster or slower

98
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,440
and if we also want this catalytic cofactor to be replicated then the question is how how is

99
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,600
that possible I mean how what what kind of systems can both satisfy the first one that we have

100
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,000
the catalyst being in a energy transducer and a combinatorial cofactor and it can also be

101
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,400
replicated and and now as we go on I have to emphasize that I'm not trying to solve the

102
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,840
origins of life I mean the historical origins of life here on earth we're just trying to create

103
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:34,720
life in the lab from from non-living materials so so um so how do we think about this I mean we

104
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,360
we've tried a number of different things and this is sort of the workhorse that we are currently

105
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,560
believing in where we have a um you can see over here we have we have a

106
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,080
vesicle fatty acid vesicle and on on this exterior of this vesicle we have anchored

107
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,440
an energy transducer this is a ruthenium complex with a with a tail a hydrophobic tail

108
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:12,240
and then we have a DNA duplex which is a cofactor so so here we have we have a sort of a blow-up

109
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:21,040
up here we have the energy transducer and and it it's composed of both this molecular system that

110
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:30,240
can capture light and and and then a a energy transducer that can deliver an electron and

111
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,040
we have a little blue indication up here because it turns out that depending on what kind of

112
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:45,280
bases we have in a DNA or an RNA or a pna strand uh we will have a good or a bad

113
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,760
cofactor so so we have the we have this as a ruthenium complex and up here we have an oxygoinine

114
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:03,440
because oxygoinine is a very good or reasonably good uh electron donor um so how how so how can

115
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,240
this work i mean what what what does it do and and also how is how is this cofactor actually

116
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,520
able to replicate because we know that replication without enzymes is is very very difficult can

117
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,320
ask a question absolutely yeah i'm curious why you chose DNA instead of RNA since

118
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:31,040
on auto catalysis has been RNA yeah that's more likely to auto-catalyze than DNA well it's simply

119
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,720
because we uh DNA is much easier to work with it's much cheaper and and and if you look at

120
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,600
charge transfer which we will focus on here it it's it's more difficult to do charge transfer

121
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,400
in RNA than it is in DNA DNA literally thousands of papers out on charge transfer of DNA and all

122
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,240
all kinds of different so so we and the reason why we're using ruthenium is also because it's the most

123
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,840
studied uh uh energy transducer photo photocatalysis there is so so that's why the chemists they've

124
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:18,240
chosen they've chosen that so just to indicate what we mean by this protocell and to to be

125
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,440
interesting it has to go through a life cycle so remember before this was a protocell that

126
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,520
is composed of in principle three different components the membrane i mean the vesicle

127
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,600
uh this energy transducer and the cofactor then we feed the system with an oily substance

128
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,560
that will then go into the membrane this is pigolinium ester and we can then by

129
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:58,320
illuminating the system turn pigolinium ester into fatty acid and then that means that we get more

130
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,320
membrane and as the membrane expands then the protocell gets gets bigger eventually if you

131
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,160
run the process long enough then it will get unstable and it will divide and not in a controlled

132
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:19,520
way but you'll get spotting events so as we do that or as this metabolic process runs we also

133
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:29,440
provide a small oligomers which are pieces of DNA and they will then template if we make sure that

134
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,680
this DNA has some certain properties which we'll get into a little later it has to have

135
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,520
it has to have deletions and imperfections so it doesn't glue too strongly together so it's not

136
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,720
hybridized too strongly then we can actually get a replication of these of these cofactors

137
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,720
and then over time you'll eventually end up with with two or more sometimes not it doesn't divide

138
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,520
but on average you actually do get more of these aggregates

139
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
so

140
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,840
how I promise to talk a little bit about how we can actually modulate a metabolism with the with

141
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,720
the DNA yeah we've done a number of we've done experimental and theoretical work on this for

142
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:35,600
many years this was our first life cycle of a of a protocell it was Mauer's PhD thesis

143
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,440
where she demonstrated it where we actually have yeah anyways we we yeah it goes I don't want to

144
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,560
get into details but we can actually show that that that you can that these that these vesicles

145
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,680
they can grow and divide and by keep feeding this the guillenium ester we can actually get the system

146
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,280
to generate more and more of these of these vesicles but here we don't have a replicating

147
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:13,200
DNA strand we only have oxo guanine as a as an electron donor there isn't any so there isn't any

148
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,680
inheritance so we have to provide new oxo guanine all the time

149
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:29,840
so how how does it actually work if we want to have and have this process to to to act or have

150
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:44,480
have this cofactor to act as a as a as a modulator and so here is the surface of the membrane the

151
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,840
fatty acids are the green ones and the blue ones these are these oily the guillenium esters and as

152
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:00,720
you illuminate the ruthenium complex which actually intercalates the self-assembles into the into

153
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:10,160
the DNA then what happens is that you will steal this once once it gets activated it will steal a

154
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:19,200
an electron from a guanine that is sitting in in the vicinity because once it gets activated then

155
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:28,640
an electron jumps from the ruthenium metal out to one of these bipyridine antennas here

156
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,520
and and then it'll steal an electron from the strand so now there is a hole there's a missing

157
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,360
electron and it'll diffuse up and down the strand until it eventually will be absorbed by the oxo

158
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,040
guanine and as we have an energy rich electron here it's been banged out there by the light

159
00:19:51,680 --> 00:20:00,000
then this electron can actually be used to to deprotect a picolinium ester and turn it into a

160
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,560
fatty acid it needs to have a we need to have a sacrificial proton donor and then this process

161
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,960
will go and then we don't we don't like to have a damage the oxo guanine so we need to have a the

162
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:23,440
same what's it called or a proton donor here but at the end of the day we actually convert

163
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,720
this oily substance into membrane so the system grows and this is modulated by the

164
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:39,200
strand here because if if we can't if we can't get get rid of the hole then this this ruthenium

165
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,480
complex is sort of say on it's not usable for one for one for the next for the next time

166
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,320
it has to be you know it has to be it has it needs to have this electron back

167
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,680
so what we've done here is looked at this process and tried to calculate

168
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
how the strands they how well the strands they

169
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,200
conduct these holes depending on the sequence and unfortunately that if you go to the literature

170
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,680
I mean we don't have the measurements for that it's not all transition states that's

171
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,960
actually published we don't know what the rate constants are from all these different

172
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,280
combinations this is what we were able to to find and we had to we had to guesstimate some of them

173
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:40,240
ourselves and these are either direct measurements or they are of an issue calculations I mean where

174
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:49,280
you have quantum calculations of of of this system so we have the rates from for instance going from

175
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,840
from an a to an a or from an from a g to an a etc and you can then you if you want to simulate

176
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:07,520
such a system you can set up the matrix like this and you will then have the these rate constants

177
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:16,560
they will determine how likely it is for you to go from one state to the other and mostly

178
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,880
you see off diagonal you have diffusion and then every once in a while they are actually what we

179
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,160
call super exchange where if you have a gc pair and then you have a gc pair a little I mean a

180
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,400
couple of of three sides four sides further down you can actually have the hole to to tunnel

181
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,760
the quantum tunnel for one from one to the next so what we've done we've first we looked at all

182
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,200
these rates and when we realized we couldn't just we couldn't make all the rates on one hand they

183
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,320
are all the sequences in the world on the one hand that was good because we didn't have simulation

184
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:03,520
time to to simulate strands I think we we go on now I know we go up to about 18 strands of 18

185
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,520
that's what's been we've also done experiments and other has done experiments with and if you

186
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:18,960
take what what we know here and you then do the actually do the counting you can only construct

187
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,840
or you can at most construct 160 strands so what we've done we have constructed these 160

188
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,840
strands and then we've done the simulations we've then found these medium first passage

189
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:44,960
time for the hole to to get up to the to the octagon and and and also we actually also

190
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:53,040
calculated the the the mean there's a little bit of difference but how experimented what's it

191
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,240
you said that you found mean first medium first passage time how did you find it

192
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,240
no this was this was this is calculations these are calculations all of these transition

193
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,600
this transition constants they are found either experimentally or they are found with first or

194
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,240
I mean with with the quantum mechanical calculations or a couple of them we had to

195
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,760
guesstimate because we couldn't find them in the literature but they probably are known I

196
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,320
don't know it best to like 10 percent but for instance here you've said you know times like

197
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,480
this 10 digits not 10 but five digits so is it just for fun what is for fun for instance this

198
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:48,000
tau you've you said you know something with like four significant digits so five significant digits

199
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,880
and this numbers you know rates you probably know with I don't know five percent ten percent

200
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,440
oh yeah oh yeah I know don't know this don't worry about that yeah yeah no no no we don't know

201
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,920
this should yeah no no no yeah so so so that that's just what that's what what the computer cranked

202
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,960
out no no don't worry about all the all the digits there we are we just know what the order of magnitude

203
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:23,200
is and that's it we cannot count on more any other questions yeah I don't understand right

204
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,960
the idea here is to understand the timing it takes to saturate the electrons being trapped in the

205
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,920
eight oxo yeah and then but yeah but then what limits you're assuming 18 base pairs of length

206
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,040
these could grow I assume and no no no no no you have you have just think about think about uh

207
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,800
don't think about any changes just think about a DNA yeah a duplex that has a certain length

208
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,160
you can then place the oxygorne in different different different locations and you can you

209
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:01,120
can then also have different ATs or GCs but then I'm thinking in your system you need the DNA to

210
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,160
self replicate yeah okay that comes later they come longer than 18 base pairs no we don't we

211
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,360
don't allow it to get longer because we we feed it with with with the pieces so we can make sure

212
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,840
that it doesn't get any longer but that's that's sort of the that's that's actually the next step

213
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,520
here you're too fast so so just to to show here what we got out of that so this is the histogram

214
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:31,040
of all the of all the simulations this is where we have the slow ones is when we have the oxygorne

215
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,960
above the ligation side and and this is the fast ones when we have the oxygorne below the ligation

216
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,840
side that means it's close to the to the ruthenium complex which makes sense and then there's a

217
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,520
bunch in the middle where it's more complicated what's happening so so that's the result of our

218
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:57,760
our simulations now obviously there's much more going on than just charged charged transferred

219
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,480
in the DNA if you look at this this is a I think we've gotten pretty much all of the reactions

220
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:12,880
in here for our metabolism this is the ruthenium complex in ground state it's activated by light

221
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,480
and then it can either jump back again or you can actually deliver this energized electron to

222
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:30,080
to the to the DNA and you can then have the charge run up to the to the oxygorne you then

223
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:38,160
destroy or you modify the what's it called the the oxygorne it actually loses a hydrogen

224
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,880
atom and you then have to repair it and then you go around in this in this cycle here and

225
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:55,200
then downstream as you as you go down to the ground state here with with the ruthenium

226
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:05,520
then you can use this energy to convert picolinium ester into a into into a lipid into a fatty acid

227
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,320
the canoic acid and and I don't want to get into all the details but we've started that both

228
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,840
experimentally and and computationally theoretically and I so we know this system fairly well although

229
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,360
all of the constants reaction constants are not known we they're not verified experimentally but

230
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,920
you can when you simulate the system you can have some bounce on them in any way if you look at how

231
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,800
look at the what determines the time for recharging the ruthenium complex

232
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:50,720
this circular reaction is determined by the charge transfer reaction constant so

233
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
if you want to to ensure that the charge transfer is is not too slow then we can figure out I mean

234
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:10,800
there is we have this this rate that that is the excitation and then we have the

235
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,280
a number of things that's going on up here but the time it takes is one over the rate

236
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:24,640
plus the time it takes going around here and then we have a rate sort of a composed rate for the whole

237
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,400
thing and if we say that we only allow the the charge transfer to slow the system with

238
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:41,120
50 percent or with 10 percent or 1 percent we can we can actually get a bound on on this rate and

239
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:49,520
we say that we only allow it to reduce the recharge with 1 percent and that means that we have a

240
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:57,200
a rate constant in this charge transport to be that it has to be larger than

241
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,040
five per sorry 50 per second and we'll require that for the as we go forwards

242
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:16,480
any question yeah and it this this is this is complicated so now we go to what you asked with

243
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:24,640
the replication how does that work and and the main sort of break that that the community got was

244
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:34,960
with juliane gibbs she and her groups they figured out a way to to actually replicate

245
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:46,080
DNA without enzymes by doing a a ligation reaction and and making sure that we don't have

246
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,280
product inhibition and and the community has sort of been has been struggling i mean i had

247
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:00,080
to pay several phd students we weren't able to solve it and i mean many many many people have

248
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:12,880
tried to do DNA or RNA amplification with without luck and and it turns out that if you make if you

249
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:21,440
make mismatches or bulges or air bases add that to the DNA strand you can actually get

250
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:33,760
it exponential amplification by by by by having having these errors in in the DNA and and she

251
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:42,240
calls it the lesion induced DNA amplification and and if you just look at it here then

252
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:51,280
then we have some mismatches or some a basis that means it could be where there's no

253
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,240
actually there's no base at all it's just a backbone and if you have have this destabilized

254
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:08,320
enough then there is enough breathing in this short system so that when you feed it with with

255
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,080
these resource strands here and provide an extra ruthenium complex you will actually be able to get

256
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,880
and replication so that's how the replication happens and this has been demonstrated in the

257
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,600
in the lab many many times many groups nobody so far has done it while the DNA has been anchored so

258
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,440
that's something that has to be done yeah you start with mismatched yeah that's how this works but

259
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,960
do you end up with a product that's mismatched yes interest because else you can't you can you can

260
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,200
dehybridize interest so else you and that's that then you get a product inhibition so this is the

261
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,840
main the main that that's the main i mean this is the the ingenious thing that that uh uh julie

262
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:01,760
gives she did anyway so at the end of the the day we have a cofactor replication

263
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:12,320
so now we can write down the reaction diagram you can see that here and then you end up with

264
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,520
15 coupled ordinary differential equations i've written the first two ones there are 13 more

265
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,880
and what's interesting here is if you look at the all the reactions almost all of them are of this

266
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,920
form where you have two two reactions that turns into a third one or you have and all of it is

267
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,640
reversible except the ligation part where you actually glue these at the backbone together

268
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:48,160
and then we know from the ratio relationship between Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium

269
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,880
constant here this is something you've learned in in college chemistry if you then know

270
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,600
one of these either the forward or the backwards rate then you can actually and you know the the

271
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,520
free energy associated with the hybridization then you can find the off rate and turns out the on

272
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,760
rate is much faster than the off rate i mean much much faster and it doesn't depend much about it

273
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:21,360
doesn't depend that much on the sequence details so if we for the sake of simplicity assume that

274
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:30,880
it's constant then we can find the off rate by by sorry if we know this one and if we know the

275
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:37,760
delta g and delta g is we've taken from santa lucía and hicks there they made this monumental

276
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,000
work where they actually figured out how to calculate this free energy but also use there's a

277
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,880
lot of online tools like a new pack that gives you gives you the the free energy and actually

278
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,920
turns out that depending on what you're using you always get differences it's still there's still

279
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,080
a little bit of of what's it called art and i don't think they've really nailed it down but

280
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:11,680
anyways that's how we can we can figure out what the rate constants are by when we have the sequence

281
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:21,680
then we can calculate the off rates so the results here are given to the left so we get

282
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:29,760
replication rates and they're sort of all over the place in in this range here again this is the

283
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:38,720
logarithm we are using and and what we have to compare here is when we do these experiments

284
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:48,480
to do the ligation we need to have one of the ends energize with imidazole and that actually

285
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:55,360
decays in water it falls apart in water so if you can't wait forever because else the system will

286
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:02,880
simply die and the rate is i think the the place where they found the highest rate was about 10 to

287
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:12,640
the minus 5 10 to the minus 5 per second so it's a relatively slow rate and we just we decide that

288
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,720
we want to have a replication rate that it's at least one order of magnitude faster so we say

289
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,560
that replication rate has to be higher than 10 to the minus 4 and that's here so we these guys are

290
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:34,320
okay so there's a few of them that will be they'll be disqualified now to make simple to make things

291
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,080
simple we've actually assumed that this happened and bought and not on a surface at an interface

292
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:47,520
now we did do interface calculation then you have to adjust some of the rates and it turns out that

293
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,720
it's at least an order of magnitude the collision rate is at least an order of magnitude faster

294
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,800
if you do it on the surface but since there are many other reactions involved it's not

295
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,800
that that big of a difference and this is assuming there's no crowding if you have too many molecules

296
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,800
i actually don't know what happens if there's a crowding but we've also that's a whole other

297
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,040
story we we've made we actually made a model we this is a sipping graph model where we can

298
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,840
where we can take into account how it went when they collide on the surface how they actually

299
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:30,160
also involved how depending on on this on what sequence details you have then sometimes you'll

300
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,080
sliding and mismatches it takes a while for it to find the the the final situation so you can

301
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,080
actually do the ligation but that's a different story but i think that it is true i believe

302
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:53,120
that it is faster on the surface than it is in bulk so now we've done a study of charge transfer

303
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,920
or charge transport on the dna we found out how fast or how slow we will allow the system to be

304
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,400
and we've also done replication studies figure out you know of these 160 strands that we

305
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,200
we have started which ones are fast enough etc so another question is of course how

306
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,200
what does that mean for the for a protocell how do we combine these findings and that's the

307
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,200
the last question namely try to figure out i mean how can the combined charge transport and

308
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:38,720
replication process support a protocell life cycle so the first thing the easiest thing to do

309
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:47,040
is to look at simply map these two our findings out on two different in a coordinate system

310
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:54,000
where we have the the sorry the charge transfer rate on the the logarithm to the charge transfer

311
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:03,520
rate on the x-axis and this is the logarithm of the of the replication rate constant on the y-axis

312
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:12,400
and then we we had these as we had these requirements that we need to have the the this

313
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:23,600
this charge transfer to be faster than than than 50 per second and the replication rate has to be

314
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:30,000
faster than 10 to the minus 5 10 to the minus 4 per second so so we are good with replication in

315
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,720
the blue area and we are good with with charge transfer in the reddish or light right red area

316
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,120
and this area out here is then the sweet area this is where both things are are satisfied

317
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:56,160
one thing i didn't discuss earlier is that for to have a good coupling between i mean for for

318
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:03,040
selection and replication we we it's you you want to have your dna to replicate

319
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,880
and not just be the resource pieces that can actually run the metabolism so if you think

320
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,680
about if you have a an oxygrenine right next to the right next to the surface of the vesicle

321
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,200
in one of the pieces one of the resource pieces you give the system then you don't need to have any

322
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,640
replication to actually run the metabolism because the the the oxygrenine can communicate

323
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,480
directly with the ruthenium complex you want to have the oxygrenine higher up so you need to have

324
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:46,240
have a charge transfer in in in the duplex in in this pipe stacking that you have inside the

325
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,840
dna what these what this charge transfer can happen so so all the the the round one the circles

326
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:02,720
they have they have the um they have the oxygrenine above the ligation site i mean higher up on the

327
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,200
dna away from from from the surface and all the triangles they have it very close to the surface

328
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,600
so so in a way we we uh these are the fastest ones but we don't like them because it doesn't

329
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:26,080
connect the two things very well but anyways it's it was kind of surprising to us that 63 out of these

330
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,880
160 test the strands they actually satisfy these conditions so that's uh that means that we if we

331
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,880
just make strands we should we should be possible for us to uh to actually make it work so the next

332
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,600
i'm going to tell you is is i'm not sure how much um how relevant it is for for the experiments but

333
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:56,480
i couldn't help doing it um and because you have you have the uh the these two mechanisms you have

334
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,400
the replication and you have the charge transfer and is there a sort of a mathematical way to connect

335
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:10,320
these two and it turns out that we a long time ago while i was still here still living here in in

336
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,480
Santa Fe um we actually did a study it was a grad no it's actually a grad undergraduate his name

337
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,120
is Tristan uh he did this here where we looked at a system where uh we have a single stranded

338
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,200
a dna or a template and we have an we have oligomers you can then make duplexes um

339
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,400
because they they uh they hybridize they are ligated and then they can uh separate against

340
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,760
you have two single stranded uh dna and then you have precursor lipids i mean oily substance

341
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,920
that that together with the duplex here um is able to to to make lipids so that's a these are sort of

342
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:01,280
the much simplified much more simplified system um where we have separated we earlier you know

343
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,080
previous work here earlier today we looked at this separately and this separately here we can

344
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:15,040
solve these two things uh together and and it's not so simple because we have to look at uh you

345
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,440
have to distinguish between the global concentration and the concentration of substances in these small

346
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,400
protocells on the surfaces so you have the local concentration of the template um and then what is

347
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,600
the volume of of the of the protocell container of the the surface and this is a number of of

348
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,560
protocells you have in the system that gives you the global the global concentration of of your

349
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:51,440
of your templates to give an example so it takes a little bit of of manipulation but you can get

350
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,760
get these equations out one for the uh for the production of of templates and one for the production

351
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,560
of the aggregates and in this you have a a replication rate and you have this metabolic rate

352
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,200
which i mean the metabolic rate is includes this charge transfer and it turns out that these two

353
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,840
equations if you if you divide this one with this one you get a Bernoulli equation that can

354
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,960
actually be solved analytically and um you can then if you do that uh you can then get a doubling

355
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:33,680
time expressed with all these things here and that means that you you actually if you look at it here

356
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:41,600
you have a a doubling time then you have to switch it around the to the reciprocal uh expression

357
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:49,920
so you get you get this k t squared and you have the uh the k sorry where is it and k l that's in

358
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:58,320
in uh that's in the first order and then this will be uh uh to one-third so so this if you want to

359
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:06,720
to uh to make a combined um fitness function or whatever you want to call it a gross rate function

360
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,880
then it will the best guess that we could come up with is using what we know from from this system

361
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,640
which is very similar although a simplification we will then have to multiply these two guys

362
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:32,320
with different with broken with broken exponents so if we do that and then we order our

363
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:41,360
uh our sequences again um where we we rank them from the worst to the best we get uh

364
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,720
yeah well it's yeah some kind of theoretical fitness uh coefficient for for for the system here

365
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:59,760
and you can see that it has it has the same shape as you can see here here they're sort of

366
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,720
they're they're civil they're these three uh plateaus of three different regimes uh if you

367
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,480
just go back here that's yeah so since i'm i can't follow some of the chemical details

368
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,360
is is the is this your design process for coming up with these sequences or is this a fitness

369
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:29,520
landscape that you're hoping these protocells cells mutate and and improve on so so so

370
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,920
this is more this particular thing i was i was debating whether i wanted to

371
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,200
you know include it or not because this is just for for i think this is more an intellectual

372
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,520
exercise because we we believe that this is the shape of a fitness function but since we

373
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,600
we've just taken these two constants there was many more constants or there are many more

374
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,720
parameters involved in the other system but i think that that will be sort of the functional form

375
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:03,920
um but you cannot make any quantitative uh assessments from from this uh to to the to the

376
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,520
real system but but ultimately is this is this sort of consideration what you're using to design

377
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:19,680
the best sequence or or are you hoping that the protocells will mutate and that the sequence of

378
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,520
the highest metabolic rate will take the population so so so here from we already know

379
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,680
which is uh which is a good uh uh charge transfer i mean you want to be up here because then you're

380
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,400
both good at charge charge transfer and you're good at replication so so you want to uh experimentally

381
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,960
want to you want to pick uh some of these sequences here and then uh once you've picked a sequence i

382
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,920
mean just there'll be a big party if we get it to work i mean if the system can just replicate

383
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,440
and and not die um then we can feed the system with the pieces of sequences that are better we

384
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:04,400
our calculations predict are better and if that's indeed true then we'll see a takeover of this of

385
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,320
the new co-factor and then there'll be another party so does that make sense

386
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:23,440
let's say the the the evolution isn't taking place through mutation exactly no no no i did

387
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,880
you you're feeding it like different oligomers yeah so so it can pick from different oligomers

388
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,880
and the i mean these oligomers they'll form uh they'll form these duplexes that are then

389
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,240
cofactors and the ones with a good co co-factor will uh i'll compete the other one yeah on the

390
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,480
same topic you design the oligomers so that they have the imperfections yes you need to do that

391
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,160
else we can't else we can't unless you so you play god you have to oh yeah with the imperfections

392
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,720
yes because otherwise you don't get that that's right that's right yeah no no we we have to i mean

393
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,400
in these are new imperfections because you break the molecule at the first imperfection right and

394
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,520
then it's gonna anneal again at the same imperfection so you have to you have to create a new

395
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,880
imperfection in what you're feeding with or no we just we just make sure that there are mismatches

396
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,280
or there is a basis in the right places matches what's that that there's some mismatch yeah there

397
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:25,120
has to be and and they can't well depending on where you put the mismatches it works well it

398
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:31,920
doesn't work very well so so there is a number of details that that i i don't think well i can

399
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,280
say one thing for sure that right at the ligation side that's where you have need to have a bulge

400
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,680
or a an airbase because without doing that you you won't you you will not prevent

401
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,800
what's it called product inhibition but but where you put the other mismatches depends on the rest

402
00:49:52,800 --> 00:50:00,160
of this of the sequence for instance if you have lots of AT's they're weak compared to GC's so then

403
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,640
you if you have if you have sort of a GC heavy sequence you need to have more mismatches than

404
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:14,880
if you have an AT heavy sequence and and the ultimate goal here is that so that you ensure

405
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:24,000
growth of the lipid and the DNA and the little energy molecule at the first order rate kind of

406
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,960
over time you you ensure that that's the goal yeah the goal is to just have the have all the pieces

407
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,920
to play together no nobody has done that so far and that would be that'll be fantastic and then

408
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:44,160
i think that if we can make that play in the lab then i think to actually see a see an evolutionary

409
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,240
takeover will not be so hard i mean the difficult thing is to see whether this can actually work

410
00:50:50,240 --> 00:51:00,160
just want to show one more fun thing here so yeah i think this is theoretically interesting

411
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:07,440
i don't think it helped us much too in the lab but here's another thing that this was

412
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,200
Artemis he pointed out that it's actually interesting to to look at the functional

413
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,000
information it's not easy to calculate the functional information in in real molecular

414
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:26,320
systems but in this system it is easy because we we can we can this is a hasten hasten's paper

415
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:32,960
we used or his idea i guess it's from a show stack originally but anyways we can we can calculate

416
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,120
the probability that we have a strand if you pick a strand at random from these

417
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,400
what is it hundred and and 60 strands i get yeah you know it's 160 strand so what is the chance that

418
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,280
it satisfies this condition divided by the total number of strands that gives you the

419
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,080
probability that you pick a strand that's good enough for a charge transfer you can do the same

420
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:05,200
for replication and you can ask for both of them to be fulfilled and then you have the probability

421
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:12,320
for that and then we can calculate the computation the compositional functional information by

422
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:21,280
taking the the logarithm minus the logarithm and then simply calculates these and then

423
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,840
we'll get these results out and if you look at it here

424
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:40,160
we have calculated the oh yeah so this is a functional information from for the charge transfer

425
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:47,120
process where we have again ranked them so we've said the bad ones first and they get better and

426
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:56,400
better and better and better and they will then level out up here at about 2.32 bits because

427
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,160
we have 32 strands that have identical charge transfer rates so that's why it stops there

428
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,480
it's a little bit different over here for the replication but if you do the calculation you get

429
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:16,720
just one point 34 bits for for of information is necessary to ensure

430
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,480
growths about self-sustaining so it's not very much information but again there were 63 strands

431
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:30,880
out of these 160 that satisfied our our goal so i'm sorry yeah experimental what this plots

432
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:38,000
they will stay cases you got this howl from experimental no no no this is this is from

433
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:46,560
by taking by ranking um uh by by simply calculating the this is the the functional

434
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:55,760
information here by by calculating the functional information uh then then you you'll have as you

435
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:03,120
go through the strands then as you get better and better strands uh there'll be fewer you have

436
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:09,680
to be more and more lucky to pick the right strands and if then rank order them you get a staircase

437
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:17,760
like that does that make sense what do you what do you say yes going back to chris's question

438
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:24,080
if you did this as a full population explicit evolutionary situation you'd say the strands

439
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,440
that survived only gained 1.34 bits over the strands that didn't survive everything

440
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:35,840
sort of like the information dealt yes yes yes yes but but there will be but there will be a

441
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,320
even though you just make it over the threshold then there'll be some that are better than just

442
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:46,160
doing the threshold so so you can then calculate what that is i mean this is the threshold for

443
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:54,480
for for these 50 per second for the for the charge transfer and and this is the one for the

444
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:04,000
replication over here so are you maybe we can talk about it afterwards how we how we do this

445
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,560
but it is it's it's really not it's very simple you just you just take the you just rank order

446
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,880
um how much information there is as you improve as you improve the strands

447
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:26,960
and and so this is the best ones they are the ones that are fastest here okay so

448
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:39,760
so hypothetically what we want is to set up a chemostat where we put in resources and then

449
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:46,640
we have a certain outflow rate and so this is the inflow rate this is the outflow rate

450
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:54,000
and we have to know the hydrolysis of all these processes or all the the products or the the

451
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,320
i'm sorry the the input and and and these are then the fitness rank cofactors and and this is

452
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:08,160
where we've used we can think about it from from what we calculated earlier and these are the

453
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:15,840
resources these are the different types of oligomers in the system as well as as a picolinium

454
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:23,520
ester and we have to have this proton donor etc etc and we then get i mean you are probably

455
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:33,760
familiar with these with these chemostat equations and you then get if you look at the biomass we

456
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:41,120
then get a transition for life where these where this is fulfilled and and i think what's interesting

457
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:48,800
is that it's extremely important it's not just the um the the what's it called the gross factors

458
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:56,320
or the fitness function you you have to look at what the degradation rates and then as you can

459
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:02,800
see the rest of it is actually environmental parameters which are really important and then

460
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:10,800
to end up here we have a so that's i guess our perspective on on what what's going on

461
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:18,240
where we have a if this is again lined up where we take the strands the cofactor with higher and

462
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:26,560
higher fitness so so once you are below this self-maintaining threshold you will be flushed out by

463
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:35,280
the chemostat but if once you're above it then you'll actually have a biomass existing in terms of

464
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,760
protocells and if you just pick these strands at random and provide them then it'll probably be

465
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:49,920
you know a discontinuous there'll be discontinuous jumps if you if you put them in sort of one

466
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,600
after the other with the one is a little bit better then it'll be approached or it'll be

467
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:59,760
approximated with that with a continuous curve so you know i know that the literature people talk

468
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:07,520
about whether you can view the transition to life as a first or a second order phase transition in

469
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,680
biomass and i think you can you can you can do both here and also the the same will be true this is

470
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:22,720
our it's just a symbolic representation of the functional information here and yeah this is where

471
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:30,320
once once you actually have a cofactor that's able to support this protocell life cycle then

472
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:37,840
you have the possibility of starting to to select information or store and select information

473
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:47,360
once the co cofactor doesn't provide you fast enough metabolism and fast enough replication

474
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,560
then the system will just be flushed out

475
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,840
so so what did we get out of this study i mean i i was you know you go in there and you don't know

476
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,320
what well i didn't know anything about charge transfer my my graduate student denied us so we

477
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:15,200
had to we had to take a crash course and that and and many people are real specialists they all said

478
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,320
oh we have to do quantum calculations of initial calculation but if we did that you know we'd have

479
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:27,840
to occupy one of the big machines for for weeks for for making a calculation of a single duplex

480
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:33,760
and we wanted to have an ensemble to figure out you know what what what the differences were so

481
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:41,120
that was why we we did this this differential equation approach instead but the most important

482
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:49,120
thing is that we can't really reject that this will work i mean along the way when we've

483
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,720
tried to implement this a living system in the lab from time to time we've

484
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,320
has either been impossible experimentally or we've figured out that we hadn't thought about

485
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:07,440
enough and theoretically we we made a boo boo but here it seems like 30 or 63 of them are actually

486
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:14,080
okay and then there are some assumptions that i think is important we have assumed that we have

487
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:21,520
super exchange uh across the bulge across this uh ligation site we couldn't figure out whether

488
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,760
this is indeed true or not uh we couldn't find any literature on it we did assume that it is possible

489
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,920
if it is not possible then we need to use uh we need to put our oxygen in just below the

490
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,880
ligation side so that you need to still have a hybridization you need to have a duplex

491
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:45,760
for for having the charge transferred to to actually work and another important

492
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,120
approximation is that we don't have any interactions between the charge transport and the

493
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:57,840
replication dynamics or the environment so we are sort of using a super a simple superposition

494
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,960
of the two and of course a more comprehensive simulation that's much more complicated would

495
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,360
take all these things into consideration but we didn't dare to venture into that

496
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,000
so so i think these are the two most important uh sort of simplifications and and then of course

497
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,200
the main issue here is to hopefully convince a sponsor that we can we can test this in the lab

498
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,040
thank you

499
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,040
questions

500
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:43,840
else i'll be around until uh May 8th so we can talk if you have questions
