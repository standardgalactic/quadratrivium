0	10400	I'm speaking at SFIs for a public lecture, I think around over 20 years ago, when I was still young, they had a compression on me for thinking that I had new physics type thinking in ecology.
12120	29020	He's been at UC Berkeley, the answer to SFI for a long, long time, doing incredible research. That's a big interface of math, physics, biology, very ecology focused, really asking the deep ecology questions, but bringing the bear whatever tools you can, putting maximum lots of
30020	31020	Thank you, John.
33020	34020	Thank you.
35020	42020	I always enjoy coming here and talking with people and refreshing myself.
44020	52020	I'm going to talk about bungee and forests and a very controversial topic, group selection.
53020	72020	You've probably heard, you can't help but hear about new developments in our understanding, we hope it's real understanding, of forests and the symbiotic relationships that arise in forests with the bacteria and the fungi and the soil.
73020	80020	There's been lots of interesting speculation, some good science and some hype.
82020	95020	Here are some examples of the hype, but there's also real science behind some of the new developments in our understanding of how fungi and trees interact.
96020	100020	The headlines go overboard.
101020	109020	We didn't invent the internet, plants did, and in fact they claim they made it even better than we, than our internet.
110020	124020	There's, of course, inevitable pushback against speculative claims that talk about super organisms and use of the word communication when we talk about the relationships among trees.
125020	150020	The concept of the mother tree has been advanced and opposed by many. Nature, ecology and evolution in 2023 had an article, and I'm just giving one quote from it, positive citation bias and overinterpreted results lead to misinformation on common mycorrhizal networks in forests.
151020	166020	Just last night, a new article in Nature came across my email and it's a review of this whole concept of the mother tree.
167020	178020	The mother tree idea is everywhere now, it wasn't before, but how much of it is real and the article delves into the controversy.
181020	194020	What I want to argue here is that the reality of forests and fungi is much more interesting than anything I've just flashed on the screen for you, and I want to try to convince you of that.
195020	199020	The talk really is in three parts. The first part I think is pretty rock solid.
200020	211020	The second part begins to delve a bit into speculation, but strong support, and the third part is wildly blue sky speculation.
212020	214020	So that's the outline of my talk.
215020	233020	The work I'm going to revisit in the first two-thirds of the talk is work that was initiated actually a long time ago, three decades ago, by a graduate student of mine, Ann Kinzick, who is now an ecology professor at Arizona State.
234020	255020	There were two key papers that came out in the 90s, one in the American Naturalist and one in the British Journal of Ecology, which really go into great detail, and much of my talk will be a summary of the major conclusions from these papers.
256020	274020	The story really begins with the nitrogen cycle, and I've shown here a simple schematic of how nitrogen, an essential nutrient for plants, and microorganisms is cycled.
275020	293020	It's a little bit oversimplified, but it contains the essence of the nitrogen cycle. Green plants die, and the nitrogen in the plants becomes part of the nitrogen in the soil, part of the humus, part of the organic substrate.
294020	309020	If it's a lake, then the nitrogen in the dead algae, or a kelp, or whatever, become dissolved into the water, and you have dissolved organic carbon compounds.
310020	327020	Microbes also die, and their dead little corpses become part of the soil-organic matter pool, and microbes derive their nitrogen directly from the soil-organic matter, what they actually do.
327020	343020	It's a bit more complicated than the diagram suggests. They convert organic nitrogen, like the nitrogen found in amino acids, into inorganic nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate, and then they take up the ammonium and the nitrate.
344020	348020	So it's sort of a little bit roundabout, but that's the way they function.
348020	361020	And the ammonium and nitrate, which is produced by the microbes, chewing on organic matter, is then available for the plants, who also need the nitrogen.
362020	377020	Okay, that's the nitrogen cycle, except I'm not showing you some little tweaks, which are at the one or two percent, maybe five percent level, making this not quite a perfectly closed system.
377020	387020	There's nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere and other processes, leaching, but this is the essence of the cycle.
387020	398020	And now if we turn to what motivated the work I'm going to talk about, a seemingly trivial minor question came up.
398020	416020	I asked it at a symposium on the nitrogen cycle that was taking place at Berkeley, and somebody was presented a diagram more or less like this, and I asked the question, what determines the ratio of B to A in an ecosystem?
417020	428020	Okay, there were all kinds of answers ranging from idiosyncratic or maybe governed by some law, but we don't know what it is.
428020	434020	Actually, a few people in the audience said that the question was ignorant.
434020	438020	It didn't matter what the ratio was, so why ask the question?
438020	450020	Well, it will turn out it does matter, because the ratio will give us some interesting insight into much deeper, bigger issues, like group selection, as we'll see.
450020	465020	So what determines how much of this nutritious, inorganic nitrogen is taken up by microbes, including both fungi and bacteria, and how much is taken up by plants?
465020	473020	How do they share this common resource? They're competing for it, so they've got to figure out a way to share.
473020	481020	Okay, to answer what happened is after that symposium, Ann and I got together and we said, we've got to figure this out.
481020	491020	This seems trivial, but my guess was it was not idiosyncratic, that there was something going on and it would be worth trying to figure it out.
491020	501020	And we realized very quickly that we'd also have to turn to the carbon cycle, not just look alone at the nitrogen cycle, but also carbon.
501020	507020	Okay, here's a pretty picture of the carbon cycle, but maybe this will make things a little more clear.
508020	515020	Green plants take CO2 from the atmosphere. They also respire it back.
515020	524020	And when they die, the dead plant matter becomes the carbon in the soil, the organic carbon.
524020	528020	The organic carbon is chewed up by the microbes.
528020	542020	In fact, the microbes wouldn't exist, at least the current types of microbes, without this carbon because breaking down the carbon bonds in the organic matter in the soil is how they get their energy.
542020	553020	So this is the food that powers the microbes, and then the microbes also respire and produce CO2.
553020	565020	So this is the carbon cycle, and it's important to mention to emphasize that plant-derived organic carbon is the energy source for most microbes.
565020	575020	There are some that can get their energy from other compounds, especially in the deep sea, but we're not going to go into that.
575020	580020	Now, let's combine the two cycles, and we'll see something interesting.
580020	587020	I've just sort of superimposed those pictures that you saw before because they're both going on at the same time.
587020	595020	And now we see that there are two distinct things happening in this combined carbon-nitrogen cycle.
595020	600020	There is mutualism, and by that I mean that microbes need plants.
600020	606020	Microbes require the organic carbon produced by plants to get their energy.
606020	615020	Plants need microbes because without the microbes, all that organic nitrogen would stay in organic form.
615020	624020	The microbes turn it into inorganic nitrate and ammonium, which is what the plants need for their nitrogen supply.
624020	630020	So plants need microbes, microbes need plants. That's a mutualism.
630020	638020	On the other hand, they are both competing for this pool of inorganic nitrogen. That's the AB thing.
638020	645020	So think about it. Suppose one of the two, let's say microbes, control the switch.
645020	653020	They get to go first, and suppose they pig out. They say, we're going to just take as much nitrogen as we can.
653020	655020	What would happen?
655020	665020	Well, there'd be none left over for the plants. Plants would die, and eventually there'd be no carbon for the microbes.
665020	678020	On the other hand, they might be really selfless, utterly extreme altruistic and just forgo nitrogen, leave it all for the plants,
678020	689020	and then what would happen? They would die out, and then eventually the plants wouldn't have nitrate.
689020	701020	So you don't get carbon for the microbes if the microbes pick out, and you don't get nitrogen for the plants if the microbes are overly selfless.
701020	708020	So somewhere in between, there's got to be a happy, medium, optimum point.
708020	718020	You're going to see.
718020	724020	So this is just summarizing what I just said.
724020	727020	In a nutshell, here's the situation.
727020	736020	I want to show you this diagram, because we're going to look for this diagram later on in human society and elsewhere in nature,
736020	743020	and see that it's not just a property of this particular system.
743020	746020	That's where the and us comes in in the title.
746020	749020	Okay, here's the situation in a nutshell.
749020	751020	We have x and y.
751020	755020	Y helps x, x helps y, and they're competing for a resource.
755020	761020	How do you resolve that?
761020	768020	I'm going to first take a look at what I call a microbe maximizing strategy, MMS.
768020	773020	Later we can look at PMS, which is plant maximizing strategy.
773020	778020	So let's pretend the microbes control the gate.
778020	780020	They get to go first.
780020	785020	They take their share and leave the rest for the plants.
785020	795020	We're going to take, make them look at two models, both of which have been validated empirically, and I'll show you how,
795020	804020	to look at what happens in combined nitrogen carbon cycle models to test the MMS hypothesis.
804020	810020	We can say that the hypothesis is microbes allocate to their own growth.
810020	817020	They pick that ratio of B to A, so that they are maximizing their population size.
817020	820020	Let's just look at that as a hypothesis.
820020	824020	See what it predicts, and then see if we can test it.
824020	828020	We can also look at maximizing their growth rate.
828020	832020	I'll show you what happens when you do that as well.
832020	841020	Okay, we'll compare the predictions to available data, and then we're going to, after that,
841020	847020	look at a spatially explicit checkerboard, huge checkerboard,
847020	852020	in other words, a spatially explicit grid-based version of the model,
852020	858020	in which we can actually look at a mechanism that achieves the MMS.
858020	864020	And I'll show you what conditions have to hold in order for the MMS to be valid.
864020	873020	That is to evolve, to undergo Darwinian evolution and come about in reality.
873020	879020	Okay, here are the major assumptions of the two core models I'm going to show you.
879020	884020	I'm not going to go through all these, it will take too long, but I'm ignoring nitrogen fixation
884020	891020	because those little 2% terms that make the nitrogen cycle open rather than closed.
891020	897020	And I'm going to ignore diurnal, et cetera, variation, stochastic variation.
897020	901020	I'm going to assume the system in some average way is in a steady state.
901020	908020	I'm not going to look at highly disturbed ecosystems, which are different tomorrow than they are today,
908020	912020	very different next year than they are this year.
912020	918020	I'm going to look at a quasi-steady state and a bunch of other assumptions.
918020	920020	They're all explicitly listed.
920020	924020	I think I've listed every assumption we've made.
924020	926020	And there are two models.
926020	933020	One I call the rhizosphere model, and it's sketched over here.
933020	939020	We have the organic nitrogen, which I just call N now.
939020	947020	This is the dead plant matter and dead microbe matter that contains organic forms of nitrogen,
947020	954020	the plants, the microbes, and the inorganic nitrogen, which I'm calling I.
954020	963020	And you can write down a set of equations that are generalizations of what's called the Latke-Vulterra equations
963020	966020	in ecology, which many of you know about.
966020	974020	And they are sort of the simplest things you can write down in the form of differential equations
974020	981020	that contain a description of the processes that are shown in the diagram.
981020	983020	It's a minimal model.
983020	986020	It's what I like to call a spherical cow model.
986020	989020	You can make it much more complicated, and we've done that.
989020	993020	We've looked at relaxing the assumptions one by one.
993020	995020	Do they change the predictions?
995020	1006020	The answer is no, unless some huge, like if two-thirds of the nitrogen leeches out of the forest every year,
1006020	1012020	then you would start to violate the predictions that we make.
1012020	1014020	So why a rhizosphere model?
1014020	1018020	Well, you'll notice I don't have an organic carbon pool in here.
1018020	1022020	I don't have the organic carbon in the soil.
1022020	1031020	Why? Because the microbes are getting their carbon from the roots of the plants.
1031020	1036020	Not the roots, actually, but the fungi that infest the roots.
1036020	1043020	These are called rhizospheric fungi, and we don't have to include a separate carbon pool.
1043020	1051020	We can just call it the plant pool because the plant roots are the place where this action occurs.
1051020	1061020	It's a little bit oversimplified in that sense, but I'll show you next a carbon model that contains maybe things you're happier with.
1061020	1072020	Here's the carbon model, and it's very much like the rhizosphere model, except now there's an explicit carbon pool that's separate from the plant pool,
1072020	1079020	rather than the carbon pool being in the roots of the plants.
1079020	1090020	Okay, I'll use the symbols P, M, N, and I to refer to the nitrogen content in these pools.
1090020	1094020	That is, the nitrogen content of the plants will be labeled P.
1094020	1098020	So this isn't the mass of a tree, the trees in the forest.
1098020	1105020	It's the mass of the nitrogen in the trees in the forest, and the same is true for the microbes.
1105020	1113020	The unit, the thing that's flowing around in the model is nitrogen, not carbohydrate,
1113020	1118020	the complicated organic compounds.
1118020	1125020	The carbon model, the rhizosphere model describes many forests.
1125020	1135020	Forests tend to have lots of rhizospheric fungi, and we kind of think of the rhizosphere model as a forest model.
1135020	1145020	The carbon model is a good model for aquatic systems, where you don't have roots infested with rhizospheric fungi.
1145020	1150020	Farmland and annual grassland, and some forests.
1150020	1156020	Conifer forests tend to look more like the rhizosphere model, deciduous forests,
1156020	1159020	in some cases would look more like the carbon model.
1159020	1167020	We're going to look at both of these models and run them in parallel and see what kinds of predictions they make.
1167020	1170020	Okay, just a quick note.
1170020	1172020	Why should we trust the models?
1172020	1177020	The best way to test a model is not to look at what it says about steady states,
1177020	1187020	but to kick the system, perturb it, and then ask the model, can you predict the response to the perturbation?
1187020	1195020	It's a much more realistic and thorough way to test a model.
1195020	1202020	So we've set up systems, in this case I'm just showing you the results for some aquatic systems,
1202020	1212020	for which we use the carbon model, and what we did is we took buckets of water out of a biologically rich lake,
1212020	1220020	set up replicate microcosms in the laboratory, and added organic carbon to them,
1220020	1225020	and then asked how does it get distributed over time,
1225020	1238020	and in particular we asked about the concentration of the inorganic nitrogen that rises as the microbes start to eat the organic matter
1238020	1246020	that was added experimentally as a manipulation to the microcosms.
1246020	1258020	So picture rows and rows of replicate buckets of water, and adding different amounts of organic carbon to replicate systems.
1258020	1259020	Yeah.
1259020	1261020	What was the DOM that you added?
1261020	1262020	I'm sorry, what?
1262020	1264020	What was the DOM that you added?
1264020	1267020	Like glucose or glutamate?
1267020	1270020	What was the organic matter?
1270020	1274020	Yeah, it was dead microbes.
1274020	1283020	That turned out to be something we could make, and it was uniform and rapidly digestible by other microbes.
1283020	1287020	We didn't want to add something recalcitrant because it would take too long.
1287020	1291020	And as you can see, we ran this thing for about a week,
1291020	1299020	and what we saw experimentally is the inorganic nitrogen level shot up,
1299020	1307020	depending on how much addition of organic carbon we added to the system.
1307020	1313020	So if you make a 48 percent increase in the amount of organic carbon,
1313020	1318020	you don't see any increase at all, undetectable, in the inorganic nitrogen.
1318020	1321020	But if you double it, you see a big increase.
1321020	1329020	So there's sort of a threshold effect in here, and 180 percent goes up, 300 percent even higher.
1329020	1337020	Notice it peaks at a later and later time, so there's a lag effect, the lead peak, and a threshold effect.
1337020	1338020	Okay.
1338020	1347020	Since it's an aquatic system, we use the carbon model to evaluate what should happen in the model if you do this experiment to it.
1347020	1349020	And this is what the model predicts.
1349020	1361020	There was only one adjustable parameter, which referred to the degree of what's called density dependence in the death rates of the microbes.
1361020	1364020	That's a thing that's hard to measure directly.
1364020	1369020	And in fact, this experiment provided a way to measure density dependence,
1369020	1374020	because if you tweak density dependence a little bit, your predictions start to look different.
1374020	1378020	But we capture with the model the threshold and the delayed peak.
1378020	1381020	So we have confidence in the model.
1381020	1384020	That's really all this slide is supposed to tell you.
1384020	1387020	Just make a couple definitions.
1387020	1396020	I'm going to let rho be the ratio of two ratios, the ratio of the C to N ratio of the microbes.
1396020	1403020	That's carbon to nitrogen divided by the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in plants.
1403020	1405020	This is usually a small number.
1405020	1407020	This is typically about six.
1407020	1415020	This is often anywhere from eight or 10 to 30 or 40, depending on the type of plant.
1415020	1424020	So there's a flow weighted ratio of carbon to nitrogen in plants, microbes.
1424020	1432020	And so it's always less than one empirically, although theoretically there's no reason why it couldn't be bigger than one.
1433020	1441020	Alpha will be the ratio of the amount of nitrogen in plants.
1441020	1449020	That's what we call capital P before, plus capital I, the amount of inorganic nitrogen in the plants.
1449020	1457020	It's the ratio of the sum of those two pools of nitrogen to twice the nitrogen in the dead organic matter.
1457020	1462020	So in symbols it's P plus I divided by two N.
1462020	1470020	And alpha's always much less than one in any real ecosystem for which data are available.
1470020	1483020	The soil contains much more nitrogen than in the inorganic form than is in the nitrogen in plants and in the inorganic pool.
1484020	1491020	This next symbol, beta, is the thing we set out questioning.
1491020	1497020	What's the ratio of B to A or A to A plus B in our previous notation?
1497020	1510020	So the question now is if we take those models and look at their steady states
1510020	1516020	by solving the simultaneous equations with the derivative set to zero
1516020	1525020	and then maximize microbial biomass, what does it predict about this quantity beta?
1525020	1531020	And we'll see it to be a function of alpha and rho, both of which are very easily measured.
1531020	1534020	So that's the strategy.
1535020	1547020	The math, I think as I recall it was about 10 or 15 pages of legal pad size algebra
1547020	1554020	to solve for the maximum, to solve the simultaneous equations and get the solution.
1554020	1559020	For the carbon model, this is beta as a function of rho and alpha.
1559020	1563020	I know it's ugly, but it just really does come out.
1563020	1566020	Notice there are two solutions with a plus and minus sign.
1566020	1573020	Both of these lead to positive values of beta and you asked about multiple solutions.
1573020	1575020	There they are, there are two.
1575020	1581020	In the rhizosphere model, there's only one solution, beta is one half minus alpha.
1581020	1588020	And again, alpha and beta, sorry, yeah, rho and alpha are easily measured.
1588020	1591020	And the rhizosphere model, rho doesn't matter.
1595020	1603020	If we put in real numbers from various data sets, we looked at about 30 data sets
1603020	1607020	to get estimated ranges of alpha and rho.
1607020	1615020	And what we get as a prediction is in the carbon model beta should be between 0.75 and 0.95
1615020	1618020	or between 0.05 and 0.2.
1618020	1624020	In other words, microbes either take a relatively small share or a very large share.
1624020	1637020	In the case of the rhizosphere model, beta is one half minus alpha, alpha is very small
1637020	1642020	and beta has come out to be between 0.45 and 0.50.
1642020	1651020	So in rhizosphere applicable systems like many far, most far as,
1651020	1658020	we expect roughly a 50-50 division of alpha, of A and B.
1658020	1663020	And here are some data.
1664020	1669020	Well, I'm summarizing a bunch of data.
1669020	1678020	For the carbon model where aquatic systems are the best example,
1678020	1687020	tropical lagoon value of 0.89, a temperate deciduous forest with lots of rhizosphere at Fungi,
1687020	1692020	a value of 0.79 within the range predicted.
1692020	1699020	A largely rhizospheric system prediction was between 0.45 and 0.50.
1699020	1705020	A perennial shortgrass prairie had a value of right on the nose at 0.50.
1705020	1715020	We don't have good data for forests that are not rhizospheric.
1715020	1720020	There are very few people make these measurements of both A and B.
1720020	1726020	It turns out you have to do something called nitrogen isotope pool dilution,
1726020	1733020	which is a very tricky and complicated empirical method for deriving
1733020	1739020	what biogeochemists call the net and the gross nitrogen mineralization rates.
1739020	1741020	So there's not a lot of data.
1741020	1745020	So we don't have strong support empirically for the theory.
1745020	1749020	We have consistent consistency with the theory,
1749020	1755020	but not strong overwhelming support with 30, 40, 50 databases.
1755020	1757020	We just don't have the data.
1757020	1768020	An annual grassland system, which was characterized as having a mix of free-living and rhizospheric microbes.
1768020	1771020	So neither model would be directly applicable,
1771020	1782020	and the authors of the paper didn't know what the ratio was of the free-living to the rhizospheric microorganisms.
1782020	1786020	Its beta value fell outside the range of any of our predictions.
1786020	1789020	It's not obviously MMS, but it might be.
1789020	1793020	We'd have to know more about the system in order to use that data set.
1793020	1800020	Okay, so we have suggestive but not overwhelming evidence for the MMS.
1800020	1805020	The question then arises, how might the MMS evolve?
1805020	1811020	Let's first naively think about two types of microbes.
1811020	1816020	Strategists that follow the micro-maximizing strategy.
1816020	1822020	These are the guys that know how to maximize that function and they obey it.
1822020	1824020	We'll call them strategists.
1824020	1828020	I don't want to call them altruists for a reason we'll get to later.
1828020	1836020	I think this is a little different from altruism as it's conventionally and usefully defined.
1836020	1844020	And then we'll have tacticians who pig out at a rate far exceeding the micro-maximizing strategy rate.
1844020	1846020	Okay, what happens?
1846020	1856020	Well, if we have two jugs of water and we put tacticians or pig out pigs in one bucket
1856020	1861020	and strategists in the other bucket, you can guess what will happen.
1861020	1866020	The tacticians grow faster at first because they have a higher uptake rate,
1866020	1869020	but they reach a lower level.
1869020	1874020	The strategists start out slowly and reach a higher level.
1874020	1879020	So the microbes that can do the math end up better off.
1879020	1888020	But if you put those together in the same bucket, then what's going to happen?
1888020	1893020	Well, you can do it mathematically, but you can also do the experiment.
1893020	1900020	And the experiment has been done in many guises.
1900020	1906020	And what happens is the strategists are outcompeted by the tacticians.
1906020	1913020	In this phase of growth, the tacticians outnumber the microbes, they outcompete them,
1913020	1916020	and they actually eventually die out.
1916020	1918020	And you can see it by running the model,
1918020	1925020	but as I said, the people have also done these competition experiments with organisms with different traits.
1925020	1934020	So that says nature doesn't have organisms living completely isolated from each other,
1934020	1940020	and we don't see that or that.
1940020	1942020	So what's going on?
1942020	1948020	Well, to go further, I'm going to show you just the result.
1948020	1953020	I'm not going to try to show you how the model actually works in detail.
1953020	1958020	But what we did is we set up a large, spatially explicit grid.
1958020	1963020	I think it was 64 by 64 cells, big checkerboard.
1963020	1969020	And we populated it with microorganisms and trees.
1969020	1971020	Populated it in the model.
1971020	1973020	We didn't do this experiment.
1973020	1979020	It would be a lovely experiment to try to do, but I don't think NSF would fund it.
1979020	1989020	So this is a very typical approach in certain areas of evolutionary biology
1989020	1997020	to set up spatially explicit models and allow for several things to happen.
1997020	2002020	You can't just leave each grid cell isolated from the next one,
2002020	2005020	or else it will look like that figure I showed you earlier.
2005020	2008020	And you can't have the mix very rapidly,
2008020	2012020	because then it will look like the other bucket experiment I showed you,
2012020	2017020	where the mixing causes the die-out of the strategies.
2017020	2020020	So we want something in between.
2020020	2027020	We're also going to look at four genotypes of the microbe.
2027020	2029020	I should say phenotype.
2029020	2032020	We don't really look at genes in this model.
2032020	2034020	We have overly selfless.
2034020	2037020	We have the strategic optimizers.
2037020	2042020	These are the guys that solve the math,
2042020	2047020	and then an intermediate, higher level of uptake,
2047020	2049020	and then the tactical glutton.
2049020	2052020	So we have these four types of microbes,
2052020	2057020	and we're going to populate different types randomly across that grid.
2057020	2062020	In each cell, we'll get one type chosen at random from the four.
2062020	2067020	We're going to populate every cell with some plants.
2067020	2070020	They're not going to differ genetically or phenotypically.
2070020	2072020	They're just plants.
2072020	2078020	Another step in this whole thing would be to put in different varieties of plants.
2078020	2082020	But mathematically, I don't think it matters.
2082020	2084020	Random assignment of the microbe.
2084020	2089020	Oh, it's a 50 by 50 grid, not 64 by 64.
2089020	2096020	We're going to allow weak diffusion of inorganic nitrogen between nearest neighbors.
2096020	2099020	So we're going to have a diffusion constant.
2099020	2102020	Nitrogen can leak from one cell to its neighbor.
2102020	2111020	And we're going to do random extirpation of microbes and plants in grid cells
2111020	2116020	with recolonization by the nearest neighbor at the most biomass.
2116020	2123020	That is, you take a cell and now and then wipe it off the board
2123020	2130020	and repopulate it with this offspring of the nearest neighbors to it,
2130020	2136020	whichever nearest neighbor has the highest number of the highest biomass of microbes.
2136020	2144020	So that's really the numerical experiment is right there.
2144020	2149020	And I'm not going to tell you how we run it and all that stuff.
2149020	2153020	I just want to show you quickly some of the results.
2153020	2163020	Black means the optimizers, A2, are the dominant at the end of the run.
2163020	2169020	White means the selfish guys ended up at the end of the run.
2169020	2171020	These are the gluttons.
2171020	2174020	And gray was at A3.
2174020	2180020	It's sort of an intermediate between optimizer and glutton.
2180020	2184020	And I'm not going to show you A1 because they all died out in every run.
2184020	2187020	This poor selfless microbes disappear.
2187020	2189020	They get out and competed.
2189020	2193020	So the rhizosphere model is shown here.
2193020	2196020	And the carbon model is shown here.
2196020	2202020	And what's shown on these axes are diffusion rates.
2202020	2216020	The two sets within the rhizosphere model represent low rate of plant disturbance
2216020	2218020	and a high rate of plant disturbance.
2218020	2221020	Because we also displace the plant.
2221020	2225020	We extirpate the plants every now and then as well.
2225020	2227020	And as you can see, it makes a difference.
2227020	2238020	At a high rate, you get far fewer dominance of the optimizers.
2238020	2239020	Oh, yeah.
2239020	2245020	Epsilon is the rate of microbe extirpation.
2245020	2250020	And delta is the rate of diffusion of nitrogen between neighbors.
2250020	2255020	But in the rhizosphere model with low plant disturbance, quite a few,
2255020	2264020	but by no means all, of the runs under these different conditions of epsilon and delta
2264020	2270020	lead to dominance of the micromexamizing bacteria.
2270020	2275020	In the carbon model, there's only a few.
2275020	2283020	It makes a low diffusion rate and a low extirpation rate.
2283020	2292020	So this is kind of evidence for that it could exist.
2292020	2295020	These can evolve under certain conditions.
2295020	2303020	But there are many conditions in which the micromexamizing strategy won't evolve.
2303020	2306020	But when you look in detail, it kind of makes sense.
2306020	2311020	If you have too high a rate of diffusion, there's too much mingling.
2311020	2317020	Or if you have too high a rate of extirpation, there's too high a rate of mingling.
2317020	2327020	And then you're back effectively to the situation in this model, this situation,
2327020	2329020	where you have mixing.
2329020	2331020	Too much mixing, bad.
2331020	2336020	No mixing would work, but it's not what happens in nature.
2336020	2345020	And so this is a summary then of what the models predict for outcomes
2345020	2354020	under different rates of extirpation, different rates of diffusion.
2355020	2357020	What's going on?
2357020	2363020	What led to even some of those grid cells becoming all black,
2363020	2366020	all optimizing at the end of the run?
2366020	2373020	It's an example of what Ed Wilson and David Sloan Wilson, the two Wilson's,
2373020	2382020	who are strong advocates of group selection being important in nature,
2382020	2384020	what they call group selection.
2384020	2393020	Group selection is a concept that had come under huge ridicule,
2393020	2399020	scorn, and fire in the 60s and 70s by evolutionary biologists who said,
2399020	2403020	group selection, theoretically maybe it could occur,
2403020	2411020	but the conditions under which it can arise are so extreme that you'll never see it in nature.
2411020	2416020	And since then, Ed Wilson has shown, I think, convincingly,
2416020	2422020	but not everybody agrees that group selection explains much of the reason
2422020	2427020	for the origin of sociality in insects,
2427020	2434020	that group selection rather than kin selection is a dominating mechanism
2434020	2440020	in the evolution of social, sociality in bees and ants and so on.
2441020	2449020	In group selection, you select an outcome that would generally not arise
2449020	2453020	if all the phenotypes were well mixed all the time.
2453020	2459020	So it requires some kind of spatial separation, but not too much.
2459020	2464020	If you don't have any mixing, then you don't get that outcome either.
2464020	2469020	And nothing in nature is completely isolated.
2469020	2473020	So that's not an option.
2473020	2478020	Group selection, in our example, can lead to behavior
2478020	2485020	which would reasonably be called altruistic if the groups were well mixed.
2485020	2497020	That is, if you see a population of microbes behaving at this optimal point,
2497020	2502020	you would say that they were altruistic if you didn't know
2502020	2509020	that they came to dominance by a group selection mechanism.
2509020	2515020	You would think that they could have been more greedy.
2515020	2518020	They could have been gluttonous and done better.
2518020	2522020	The model says they wouldn't, but you would think they could
2522020	2526020	if you didn't know about the model and about the group selection process
2526020	2528020	and you would call them altruistic.
2528020	2533020	But one of them would have done better if none of the others changed.
2533020	2534020	Exactly.
2534020	2536020	But in our altruists...
2536020	2539020	Yeah, in that case they would be truly altruistic.
2539020	2541020	But that is the case you describe.
2541020	2542020	In what?
2542020	2544020	That's the case you describe.
2544020	2546020	An altruist is somebody who, by shifting...
2546020	2550020	Yeah, that's a perfectly good definition of altruism.
2550020	2553020	Yeah, so why do you resist calling them altruists?
2553020	2562020	Because it's evolving in a situation in which they are...
2562020	2569020	Each individual microbe is better off this way than being off the grid.
2569020	2576020	Wait, each individual microbe is not best responding to the strategies as you call them.
2576020	2579020	They're doing what's best for them collectively.
2579020	2584020	But one of them would do better if they deviated.
2584020	2587020	Do better in isolation or in that environment?
2587020	2589020	In that environment as well.
2589020	2592020	It would do better in the short term.
2592020	2593020	Yes.
2593020	2596020	But in the long term, its progeny wouldn't be there.
2596020	2599020	That genotype would die out.
2599020	2603020	Yeah, so do we want to use the word altruistic?
2603020	2608020	I mean, in the next 24 hours I'm better off or do I want it to mean
2608020	2614020	I'm leaving a future lineage that has my traits.
2614020	2616020	So that's the distance.
2616020	2618020	That's why I don't like to use the word altruistic
2618020	2620020	because I'd like to use the word altruistic.
2620020	2625020	I mean, not just the next 24 hours, but in the long run.
2625020	2627020	Well, you've defined altruism as such a way
2627020	2630020	that it could never evolve by natural selection.
2630020	2631020	That's right.
2631020	2632020	That's right.
2632020	2634020	Exactly.
2634020	2636020	You do know we do.
2636020	2637020	Exactly.
2637020	2639020	I don't like, I like to use the word altruism
2639020	2641020	for something that doesn't occur.
2641020	2642020	Right?
2642020	2643020	Yeah.
2643020	2645020	I'd like to reserve that word.
2645020	2647020	A long time ago.
2647020	2649020	It's just a personality version of the genuine.
2649020	2650020	Yeah.
2650020	2651020	Yeah.
2651020	2655020	So altruism in game theory.
2655020	2656020	I'm sorry, when?
2656020	2659020	Altruism in game theory is defined as you say.
2659020	2662020	Yes, as did Marcus Feldman and all the other people.
2662020	2664020	I mean, I didn't invent that definition.
2664020	2665020	Right.
2665020	2666020	No, I know.
2666020	2669020	So altruism in evolutionary theory is defined as the way you say it.
2669020	2670020	Okay.
2670020	2675020	So if I'm going to, if I use the word altruism the way you and Mark do,
2675020	2677020	then okay, fine.
2677020	2682020	But I would like to reserve it for,
2682020	2686020	I would like to think more about what lineage has survived
2686020	2688020	over revolutionary time.
2688020	2690020	I love your model.
2690020	2691020	What?
2691020	2693020	I love this model.
2693020	2694020	Yeah.
2695020	2699020	Practically, I, he's talking about the reality of the situation is
2699020	2703020	that we aren't simply living day to day,
2703020	2707020	but really the reality of what survives in this world throughout time
2707020	2710020	is the long term picture.
2710020	2712020	I just got a couple more things to go through.
2712020	2715020	One is just in case you were curious,
2715020	2718020	suppose I flipped the coin over and said,
2718020	2721020	let's do a plant maximizing strategy.
2721020	2724020	Would we get the same outcome?
2724020	2730020	And the answer is just about this.
2730020	2731020	Oh, sorry.
2731020	2732020	No, this is different.
2732020	2737020	This is instead of maximizing biomass of microbes,
2737020	2742020	suppose we might maximize their growth rate in the study state,
2742020	2745020	their gross growth rate.
2745020	2750020	If we do that, we get almost the same optimal point.
2750020	2752020	Here's a one, a two.
2752020	2755020	Here's the macro maximizing curve.
2755020	2758020	Here's the plant maximizing curve.
2758020	2760020	Not very different.
2760020	2763020	It'd be hard to tell them apart.
2763020	2774020	And I thought I had a slide of the plant micro.
2774020	2775020	Oh, yeah.
2775020	2777020	Here, several, a couple of slides.
2777020	2779020	What about a plant maximizing strategy?
2779020	2793020	In this case, the outcome is nearly similar to what we had before,
2793020	2795020	but not quite.
2795020	2799020	In the case of a plant micro maximizing strategy,
2799020	2807020	beta instead of one half minus alpha is one half plus alpha and alpha prime.
2807020	2813020	And alpha prime, instead of p plus i over 2n, is m plus i over 2n.
2813020	2819020	So it's almost a symmetric result when you maximize the plant biomass.
2819020	2824020	And in all the systems we have, alpha prime is very small,
2824020	2829020	and so the two results converge on the beta equals a half result
2829020	2833020	for the rhizosphere model.
2833020	2838020	The carbon model turns out not to have a solution
2838020	2842020	if you have plant maximizing strategy.
2842020	2844020	It just doesn't have a maximum point.
2844020	2852020	Plants should just pick out if they had control of the inorganic nitrogen switch.
2852020	2858020	But now I want to turn to the most loose guy part of this talk,
2858020	2865020	which is what else might this basic diagram that I showed you at the beginning describe
2865020	2871020	to mutualists competing for a resource?
2871020	2877020	These pollinators on plants provide a possible example.
2877020	2880020	These help plants by pollinating.
2880020	2884020	Plants help bees by supplying nectar,
2884020	2889020	but the resource that the plants make the nectar from
2889020	2894020	is competed for by both the pollinators and the plants.
2894020	2897020	The plants could use that nectar for some other purpose,
2897020	2901020	like making bigger roots and becoming more drought resistant.
2901020	2904020	But no, they use it to attract pollinators.
2904020	2909020	So again, we could ask the question, and we haven't done this,
2909020	2912020	but I'm just posing it as something interesting that could be done
2912020	2919020	but the same kind of reasoning is to look at the question of allocation of nectar
2919020	2924020	and resources between plants and microbes.
2924020	2927020	What about the human economy?
2927020	2930020	This is really the reason why I decided to give this talk,
2930020	2935020	because I think especially during the Reagan and Trump years
2935020	2939020	when you start to think about how big an issue it is
2939020	2943020	with what we do with national income.
2943020	2946020	How do we allocate it?
2946020	2952020	Let's call the wealth of the nation, it's capital wealth.
2952020	2957020	And Sam, I want you to really chime in here because I'm misusing terms
2957020	2960020	and I'm sure I'm botching the economics,
2960020	2967020	but I want to get you to help me think about this better.
2967020	2972020	We can use it to increase industrial production, factory output,
2972020	2981020	material goods, other things that we need or don't need but still produce, plastic.
2981020	2983020	This is plastic.
2983020	2988020	Okay, so we can use capital wealth to improve that.
2988020	2996020	One way to get more capital wealth going into production is to lower taxes on businesses.
2996020	2998020	Make them more wealthy.
2998020	3001020	Then there's less wealth left over for the environment,
3001020	3006020	for public health, education, et cetera, et cetera.
3006020	3010020	I'm just going to lump all these things, you just call it EHE,
3010020	3014020	environment, health, and etiquette, but it includes more than this.
3014020	3019020	It's the things that are not made in factories
3019020	3026020	and make life worth living.
3026020	3034020	The mutualism is that EHE requires capital produced by production.
3034020	3041020	Production requires EHE, so each needs the other.
3042020	3054020	The mutualism that EHE requires production is actually through capital wealth.
3054020	3061020	We can also argue about environmental degradation and its destructive effects on capital wealth,
3061020	3065020	but we don't even need to put that in, even though it's important.
3065020	3082020	Competition is obvious, both production and EHE compete for capital wealth.
3082020	3091020	It's the same diagram we had before with the fungi in the forest or the bee in the flower.
3091020	3096020	There ought to be an optimal allocation of wealth.
3096020	3108020	You could set up a model and put in reasonable functions describing the flows
3108020	3117020	and ask what determines the ratio of A over B,
3117020	3122020	the ratio of capital wealth to EHE versus capital wealth to production,
3122020	3126020	or better yet, what should determine A over B,
3126020	3132020	or more specifically, what taxation, budgetary policies, et cetera,
3132020	3135020	would result in the optimal allocation.
3135020	3138020	You'll get a solution and then you can ask,
3138020	3142020	does it look anything like where the U.S. and other wealthy nations are now?
3142020	3151020	Are we near an optimal point given the simultaneous mutualism and cooperation?
3151020	3158020	I looked at a model which I just cooked up.
3158020	3162020	I had a little bit of help from Herman Daly doing this.
3162020	3166020	I guess you all know he died tragically this year,
3166020	3171020	but Herman was interested in the stuff I was doing.
3171020	3179020	He sketched how one might put it together and make a model.
3179020	3183020	We're going to maximize some kind of objective function, W,
3183020	3186020	which is some measure of the utility function.
3186020	3192020	It's a measure of the things we want in our economy, in our life.
3193020	3197020	I just cooked up the absolutely simplest possible,
3197020	3204020	and I'm sure economists will ruin about this and can help me with it.
3204020	3211020	I wrote equations for welfare as a function of P and E.
3211020	3217020	E stands for EHE. I just lumped it all into E.
3217020	3220020	Then I wrote, instead of differential equations,
3221020	3226020	productivity at time I is productivity at time I minus 1
3226020	3232020	times some combination of capital and E,
3232020	3237020	which is required to make more production.
3237020	3246020	Educated labor force, for example, is in this symbol E.
3247020	3253020	Then you can write equations for how E is degraded by production,
3253020	3259020	and it's enhanced by capital wealth flowing to the education sector.
3259020	3268020	Capital itself increases because of production and interest on capital here.
3268020	3274020	The question then is how can we vary this critical parameter W,
3274020	3280020	which is a way of thinking about the allocation ratio
3280020	3283020	in order to maximize W up here.
3283020	3286020	When you solve that there is an optimum,
3286020	3291020	I have no idea how to put in numbers for the variables
3291020	3293020	and make it look realistic.
3293020	3297020	I just don't know enough economics to know how to do that.
3297020	3301020	I don't know what's reasonable for the exponents A and B,
3302020	3306020	or for these parameters R, M, G, and C.
3306020	3312020	That's where we are with this.
3312020	3315020	It's suggestive and I think interesting,
3315020	3319020	and I think there would be an interesting outcome
3319020	3324020	if one could really set this up realistically and solve for the optimum.
3324020	3328020	My guess, of course, and I'm sure all of you would probably guess,
3328020	3334020	that we're allocating way too little to education, environment, and health.
3334020	3338020	But this would be a way to quantitatively demonstrate
3338020	3346020	how much less are we allocating than we should if we want to maximize well-being.
3346020	3349020	Here's where I really overreached.
3349020	3352020	That was blue sky, and now we're even above the blue.
3352020	3354020	There are no molecules up here.
3354020	3356020	We're in the ionosphere.
3356020	3362020	We don't normally think in terms of how some advantageous tax law
3362020	3367020	or other social policy is selected for culturally.
3367020	3371020	I suppose we think in terms of cultural selection,
3371020	3377020	and we sort of follow the strategy I took with the plant microbe example.
3378020	3384020	We could think about weakly interacting societies,
3384020	3390020	which transfer goods, there's diffusion of resources,
3390020	3394020	there's extirpation occasionally,
3394020	3403020	and how will different strategies of economic allocation
3403020	3411020	evolve under different scenarios for this spatially explicit world
3411020	3416020	in which we have different experimental economies in different places?
3416020	3419020	Would the outcome look optimal?
3419020	3426020	I think if we could write down a model that looks like this toy model
3426020	3430020	of competition and mutualism for the economy
3430020	3435020	and do a spatially explicit grid type solution,
3435020	3440020	we would find that some kind of optimal solution should evolve.
3440020	3443020	I started thinking about this.
3443020	3446020	The US became the dominant world power.
3446020	3455020	We somehow maximized an awful lot of stuff between 1776 and 1900.
3455020	3458020	How did we do it?
3458020	3462020	Is there anything in here that helps us understand that?
3462020	3466020	I was thinking, well, the Monroe Doctrine,
3466020	3468020	that was a really neat thing in some ways.
3468020	3473020	It also had some terrible implications for colonialism in South America,
3473020	3478020	but as a global strategy of isolating us,
3478020	3481020	at least to a great extent, not completely,
3481020	3486020	but partially isolating us from the rest of the world,
3486020	3496020	we allowed some kind of very successful economic allocation strategy to arise.
3496020	3500020	I'm not saying it's one that maximized health or education or environment.
3500020	3501020	It certainly didn't.
3501020	3508020	But something got optimized as a result of the fact that we kept Europe at bay
3508020	3513020	for decades and decades, for a century.
3513020	3519020	So is there anything about the world today
3519020	3524020	in which there's enormous amounts of diffusion, if you like,
3524020	3527020	between cultures and countries?
3527020	3532020	The world is so mixed that in such a situation,
3532020	3538020	is it possible that strategic optimizing outcomes are not likely to occur?
3538020	3545020	There's too much mixing, and we are, in a sense,
3545020	3552020	going towards some suboptimal kind of culturally evolutionarily,
3552020	3554020	cultural evolution outcome.
3554020	3555020	I have no idea.
3555020	3560020	I just find the speculation interesting, and I thought I'd share it with you.
3560020	3564020	So that, I think, is the end of my talk.
3564020	3570020	Yes.
3570020	3572020	John, what about the gift economy?
3572020	3574020	How does that fit into?
3574020	3576020	Tell me more about the gift economy.
3576020	3584020	The gift economy is really how you operate without the capital that we're used to operating with.
3584020	3590020	We operate in, so you need, I'm growing a whole lot of corn,
3590020	3593020	and you need some corn, and so you trade with me.
3593020	3597020	And we have that kind of...
3597020	3604020	Sam, you sort of talked about that a little bit in your science paper, didn't you?
3604020	3609020	Yeah, but a lot of the stuff in the science paper is exactly the same.
3609020	3613020	Something at the end is not at all optimal.
3613020	3617020	I'm glad to hear that.
3617020	3622020	I think a really fascinating problem for you in the last couple of slides you're following.
3622020	3631020	In Europe, in 1450, there were something like 450 sovereign states, or state bodies.
3631020	3636020	I mean, some were run by pirates, and some were bishoprics, and so on, but they were sovereign, right?
3636020	3641020	And then, by the time of the First World War, that had been reduced to 26.
3641020	3647020	And what had happened over that period of time was been a vast homogenization of what we observed.
3647020	3650020	No more bishoprics, no more pirates running things.
3650020	3654020	We had a single form of government, which was the national state.
3654020	3658020	So that's exactly the process you're talking about.
3658020	3665020	And of course, in that situation, extirpation is there, migration among states, and so on.
3665020	3674020	So what you're talking about there has real impact in society that can be studied using the tools you have.
3675020	3683020	Back to Bobby's question, what about pre-Columbus U.S. or North America?
3683020	3694020	Tribes of people with different gift economies, I think, would be the right use of your term.
3694020	3701020	I mean, I can't study that. There's been a number of studies of group selection in New Guinea, which is easy to do.
3702020	3708020	Things like, and you can put into models, different levels of food sharing in a society.
3708020	3719020	You can just write down a whole bunch of equations, which are in different forms of something called reproductive leveling.
3719020	3726020	That is, anything which reduces the variance of reproductive success within a group has a huge effect on a soil.
3726020	3734020	It gives much greater space for group selection because it takes the graph on the right that you showed where the good guys are going to lose,
3734020	3741020	just slows down that process. So there's a whole lot of ways that this can be interesting.
3741020	3749020	And one more little fun fact, that production function that you listed there was invented by Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois.
3749020	3751020	I think I read that somewhere.
3751020	3756020	He knew exactly, and he had exactly the intuition you did.
3756020	3762020	And typically we say that A plus B is equal to one. That's called constant returns to scale.
3762020	3767020	Is that really required, constant returns to scale?
3767020	3770020	Yeah, it's always puzzled me why you sum them to one.
3770020	3779020	Well, because that means the production function is homogeneous at degree one, which means if you expand all the inputs, you expand the output.
3779020	3781020	There's no economies of scale.
3781020	3786020	Just a mathematical convenience, and it's approximately correct in a lot of situations.
3786020	3791020	I'm very sorry I have to run out of time. Are you going to be around to tea?
3791020	3793020	I'll be around all next week.
3793020	3795020	But I won't.
3795020	3797020	I'll be around this afternoon.
3797020	3799020	Yeah, where's your office?
3799020	3801020	It's way down there.
3801020	3803020	It's easy.
3803020	3805020	I'm sorry, I've got to think.
3805020	3821020	As soon as you came up with that final thing, and I was thinking, don't you feel that Joseph Tainter was basically trying to answer that with saying, yeah, when you get too much interactions and too much complexity built in as a…
3821020	3834020	But he was talking about interaction within the group, over-complexification of administration and overly…
3834020	3837020	In a sense, if we consider the group of planets.
3837020	3856020	Yeah, in a way, if you did this as a model of what's the optimal complexity of a society, you might come up with a Tainter conclusion that too much, too little, no good in between an optimum.
3857020	3860020	He often uses book scale in places like…
3860020	3862020	He used to come up with a scale, and you just mentioned…
3862020	3865020	He sort of says the scale is bigger and bigger and more efficient.
3865020	3867020	I don't agree with that efficiency, but he calls it that.
3867020	3868020	I don't either.
3868020	3872020	So he sort of says that means you're always going to go to bigger and bigger and bigger things.
3872020	3876020	This is sort of an antidote, even if I accept that definition of efficiency.
3876020	3878020	This is still like an antidote to that way of thinking.
3878020	3882020	It's not that one homogenous group is the best way to go.
3882020	3884020	That's right.
3885020	3887020	Exactly.
3889020	3890020	Mimi.
3890020	3893020	This may have been in your graphs, and they went by too fast for me.
3893020	3894020	Wait, I'm sorry.
3894020	3898020	This may have been in your graphs, and they may have gone by too fast for me to pick up.
3898020	3912020	But if the habitat is very poor in resources altogether, or very rich in resources altogether, does that affect either what the outcomes are or the rate at which they get there?
3913020	3915020	It's sort of cart before horse.
3915020	3921020	The model is telling us what it's predicting what the resources will be in each patch.
3921020	3932020	If we think of the resources as the nutrient content of the soil, carbon, and nitrogen, that's an outcome of the model, not an input to it.
3932020	3938020	But when you try to translate that to people, people living in the desert and people living in the forest, it's not like that.
3938020	3948020	When it comes to people, definitely we would have to either do some weird averaging over the whole nation's resource.
3948020	3953020	Just imagine lumping everything in the U.S. into a common resource.
3953020	3957020	That would be the ultimate in spherical cow modeling.
3957020	3967020	And that's how my instinct would be to do that first, then put in the complexity of people who live with bad soil, people who live with good soil.
3967020	3975020	On the trekker board, each patch was as good as enough.
3975020	3984020	Well, it starts out uniform, but it doesn't end up uniform because the model creates different levels of nitrogen in the different cells.
3984020	3993020	So you create heterogeneity, biologically, rather than impose it as a rigid constraint.
3998020	4002020	Thanks.
4002020	4006020	We'll see you guys 6.30, right? Yeah, good.
