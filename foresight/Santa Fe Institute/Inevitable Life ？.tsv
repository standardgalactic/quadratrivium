0	7000	So, of course, it's a great pleasure to introduce my colleague today, Eric Smith.
7000	12000	Partly because he's not just a colleague, he's a friend of mine, and he's a collaborator at the Institute.
12000	16000	Tonight's lecture, as you know, is on the topic of life, the inevitability of life,
16000	19000	and its origins in relation to geochemistry.
19000	24000	Now, one of the unfortunate tendencies of the human mind is to think categorically,
24000	30000	to think in terms of dichotomies, living, non-living, conscious, not conscious, good and evil.
30000	34000	But, of course, the world is not categorical, it's more continuous.
34000	41000	And, of course, this tendency to categorise extends to institutions, departments, physics departments,
41000	45000	biology departments, literature departments, architecture departments.
45000	51000	And for those of you who've been coming to these public lectures, you will know that the Santa Fe Institute often stands in opposition
51000	58000	to a rather simple-minded categorisation of the world, both institutional, intellectual and metaphysical.
58000	63000	Now, the topic of life, of course, derives some of its charge from the sort of categorical,
63000	68000	dichotomous opposition it stands in relation to the inanimate world, to non-life.
68000	72000	And I want you to read you a quick quote from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
72000	76000	This is a preface that she wrote to the book in 1818.
76000	83000	Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener.
83000	86000	So, presumably, she couldn't get a word in.
86000	93000	During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed and, among others, the nature of the principle of life.
93000	101000	And whether there was any possibility or probability of its ever being discovered and communicated, perhaps a corpse would be reanimated,
102000	104000	Galvanism had given a token of such things.
104000	109000	Galvanim, of course, being the application of current to muscles and their subsequent contraction.
109000	112000	And, of course, there are other stories like that of the Gollum.
112000	119000	The Gollum is mentioned in the Talmud, where Adam, in fact, was first a Gollum made from dust,
119000	123000	and the famous Gollum, of course, of Prague, the 16th-century Rabbi Low,
123000	130000	who constructed a creature to work on the Sabbath out of the mud of the banks of the River Volta in Prague.
130000	135000	And, of course, more recently, computer viruses, which some people think are alive.
135000	146000	Now, all of these narratives, Frankenstein, viruses, and the Gollum, life springs from physical and chemical processes.
146000	148000	It doesn't spring from existing life.
148000	152000	It's not like birth, where living things spawn living things.
152000	155000	These are non-living things, spawning living things.
155000	159000	At some point in the history of the earth, presumably there was no biology,
159000	164000	and some disposition of chemistry and physics gave rise to biology and the subsequent evolution of life.
164000	167000	And these are the things that Eric's going to talk about.
167000	172000	Now, Eric has done his fair share of raising disciplinary boundaries.
172000	178000	He was an undergrad at Caltech, where he did his degree in mathematics and physics.
178000	185000	He was then a post-graduate student in Austin, Texas, where he worked in string theory and quantum gravity.
185000	190000	And then he was a post-doc at Texas and then at Los Anamos before coming to the Santa Fe Institute.
190000	196000	His interests include the emergence of life that he'll talk about today, but they're not restricted to the emergence of life.
196000	203000	He's also interested in the correspondences between economic processes, physical processes, and living processes, biological ones,
203000	207000	and also the connections between energy, information, and computation.
207000	216000	So in tonight's lecture, Eric will ask whether, contrary I think to our intuitions, life might not be inevitable in the universe rather than rare.
216000	217000	Eric.
221000	223000	Thank you all for coming. David, thank you.
223000	226000	Wonderful introduction. It sets just exactly the right tone.
226000	232000	Because in a subject where there has been too much oversimplification and too much soundbite reporting,
232000	239000	I want to try to give you some sense of the richness and the beauty of the picture that comes up if we ask about the position of life on Earth.
239000	242000	So let me stop this thing.
242000	244000	And...
252000	253000	Good.
253000	258000	So tonight I get to tell you some facts or some new ideas about the emergence of life on Earth
258000	264000	that I think will change what many of us have been told about whether we should think that life on Earth is surprising or inevitable
264000	267000	and how we should ask questions like this.
267000	275000	At the same time as answering this question, it should change our understanding of the position of the biosphere within the geological world
275000	281000	and several important aspects of our position as people or as animals within the biosphere.
281000	284000	So there are many different messages that all sort of inform each other.
285000	289000	I want to set us tonight the task of answering four questions.
289000	296000	First one, why is there life on Earth at all as opposed to nothing or as opposed to an empty rocky planet?
296000	300000	How and where did it originate? Sort of obvious questions of mechanism.
300000	303000	Why has life persisted?
303000	308000	This is important because I think if we have a sensible understanding of how life emerged,
309000	317000	that must also make it sensible that life has stayed because the things that cause it to persist are the same things that caused it to emerge in the first place.
317000	321000	So the questions must be asked and answered sensibly together.
321000	328000	And then, last of all, does the biosphere contain relics of emergence so that by looking at what life is today,
328000	333000	we have a window that's informative about how it came into existence?
333000	337000	Now, before I can address any of these sort of forward-looking questions,
337000	340000	I have to address a question that has been a problem in this topic,
340000	344000	which is whether science can say anything about these problems at all.
344000	348000	And of course, since I'm here on behalf of the Institute talking to you about science,
348000	350000	you would think that this is a foregone answer,
350000	356000	but if we poll some influential 20th century scientists and particular biologists,
356000	359000	the returns we get are a little bit surprising.
359000	362000	So let me start with Stephen Jay Gould.
362000	370000	I actually chose my talk title tonight as a response to Gould's very wonderful little book called Wonderful Life.
370000	376000	Many of you will probably have read it, and it had a big influence on me with my first exposures to biology,
376000	379000	and it's a really important work of this century.
379000	385000	Gould chose the title for his book on the basis of Frank Capra's 1946 movie, It's a Wonderful Life,
385000	389000	because he felt that the movie told exactly the story he wanted to tell.
389000	394000	It's a story that an individual's actions can have permanent and important consequences.
394000	399000	And Gould's message about biology was that for the first time in science,
399000	405000	things that seem to be accidental can have consequences that could last forever.
405000	410000	So, of course, being Gould and fighting the last war against oversimplification,
410000	413000	he states things in the strongest possible terms.
413000	420000	Any replay of the tape would lead evolution down a pathway radically different from the road actually taken.
420000	424000	Now, if you take this at face value or in the context of the book,
424000	427000	it makes it sound like accidents are all that matters,
427000	430000	which kind of leaves us wondering what then is the role for science,
430000	433000	not the same as in the other sciences maybe.
434000	439000	Gould, of course, worked with things that are big enough to see without a microscope and it can leave fossils.
439000	441000	Let's go to somebody who works with things that are smaller.
441000	444000	This is Jacques Monot, who, the year I was born in 1965,
444000	450000	won a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his work on the regulation of cell machinery from the gene.
450000	455000	Monot wrote a lasting influential book called Chance and Necessity.
455000	458000	His concern was one that we've heard many times,
458000	465000	a wish that people not imprint human notions of purpose on biological descriptions of how machinery works.
465000	468000	And he was interested in arguing against two things in particular.
468000	471000	The two ways people tend to imprint purpose.
471000	476000	One, vitalism would have been a claim that when matter becomes part of a living thing,
476000	479000	it's no longer the same as other matter and we can't understand it.
479000	484000	The other, animism, which says, well, it's all matter, but it all has purpose from the beginning.
484000	492000	I think Monot's point in arguing this was to try to bring biology closer together to the other sciences
492000	494000	and the way they're understood.
494000	498000	But, of course, Monot was primarily a guy who explains how machinery works
498000	504000	and how machinery works doesn't necessarily provide a good explanation of why it's there at all or how it got there.
504000	510000	And so, faced with this difficulty, he makes a statement that if anything is even stronger than Gould's.
510000	515000	He says, the biosphere does not contain a predictable class of objects or of events,
515000	520000	but constitutes a particular occurrence, compatible indeed with first principles,
520000	524000	but not dedusible from those principles and essentially unpredictable.
524000	528000	So he starts out trying to bring biology together with the other sciences
528000	536000	and with this sort of encapsulating statement, if anything, it makes biology seem even more remote from the other sciences
536000	539000	and leaves us wondering what can we say.
539000	545000	But the granddaddy of them all, as far as strong statements, is Francis Crick.
545000	550000	Crick, together with Jim Watson, discovered the double helix structure of DNA
550000	556000	and first realized that this was the molecule that could be responsible for heredity in the way it works.
556000	561000	And Crick takes this sort of accidentalist viewpoint of Gould and Monot
561000	565000	all the way back to the beginning by associating the emergence of life
565000	568000	with the emergence of something like DNA and heredity.
568000	572000	So early, you see him here, he's looking sort of appropriately like a sorcerer,
572000	577000	presumably lecturing on the structure of the molecule that's the key to life itself.
577000	580000	And I think a lot of people have tried to think of DNA in those terms
580000	583000	and I'm going to try to push back a little against that tonight.
583000	587000	But he refers to the emergence of life as a happy accident
587000	593000	and a little bit later goes on to say, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle.
593000	597000	So many are the conditions which would have to have been satisfied to get it going.
597000	602000	Now, if there's one thing we know science does not claim to be able to talk about, it's miracles,
602000	606000	so while this is not necessarily a logical impossibility,
606000	613000	it seems like a very strange point of view for a scientist to be putting forward as a scientific conclusion
613000	616000	because it amounts essentially to throwing up one's hands and saying,
616000	619000	oh, we can't say anything about that part.
619000	625000	So if there is ambiguity in the public's understanding of what science has to say about the emergence of life,
625000	627000	I think it would not be blamed on the public.
627000	631000	Maybe we should start by looking at the things scientists have said.
631000	637000	But if there's ambiguity, it should be leading us to ask three important questions.
637000	642000	As one of my favorite political commentators says, what were they thinking?
642000	646000	Specifically, what aspect of biology are these people looking at
646000	650000	that would cause them to draw such seemingly odd conclusions?
650000	654000	For us, what's important is, is this really science?
654000	657000	Is this the nature of life that they're talking about,
657000	663000	or is it actually a nature of their point of view which might be narrow and might have left things out?
663000	667000	Because if it is just a prejudice that comes from not having looked at everything
667000	670000	and we can broaden our perspective a little bit,
670000	675000	maybe we can find that from a bigger perspective there's a story that's not all about accident
675000	681000	and that's truer to the nature of life, not necessarily to the history of science.
681000	684000	So that's what the rest of tonight is supposed to be about.
684000	686000	So what were they thinking?
686000	689000	Most of us who have seen anything about the history of life
689000	692000	have seen a picture something like this.
692000	694000	We see many pictures of trees of life.
694000	698000	Let me very briefly tell you what this is in case it's not familiar.
698000	704000	Every name here at the end, elegant things like methanosarsina and entoamibi,
704000	707000	these are big groups of organisms.
707000	712000	The tree is basically much too small for me to be able to show individual organisms.
712000	715000	And as we go down any of these lines,
715000	719000	what you're seeing is the history that led up to the organism as it is today.
719000	723000	So when you see then two lines that become one line in the past,
723000	730000	the idea is that two things that are today different once had an ancestor that was a single thing.
730000	733000	So one could easily talk for days about just this tree.
733000	735000	There's so much interesting to know about it.
735000	737000	I'll mention only a few things.
737000	745000	One, this is a representation of data that says that everything we know about in the earth is related to everything else.
745000	752000	And as far as we can tell, everything that's around today came at some point from one single form
752000	756000	that was a bottleneck from which the survivors descended.
756000	760000	Now, to give you a sense of scale, everything that you can see without a microscope
760000	764000	is these three little branches here, the plants, animals, and the fungi.
764000	769000	So the rest of what is alive in the world is individual cells.
769000	773000	Now, I couldn't make this dot small enough to only cover all of human history,
773000	775000	so it's about ten times too big for that.
775000	781000	And it's kind of a useful thing to give us a sense of what part people are in the natural world.
781000	785000	And not only scientifically, but also as human beings.
785000	789000	But the thing that I really want to point out to you about trees that's important is
789000	795000	that the only time similarities, and that's what these trees are, I should mention,
795000	798000	the trees are trees of family resemblances.
798000	801000	You see a trait that's into things and not anywhere else.
801000	808000	You infer that those two things, that the trait came from a time when those two things were once a single population of organisms.
808000	814000	Now, the only way having the same trait implies that you're related to the others that have the trait
814000	816000	is if that is infinitely accidental.
816000	821000	So this is the reason you can't use skin darkness to figure out who's related to whom.
821000	824000	Because as soon as you move toward the equator, you have to get darker to survive.
824000	827000	You move away from the equator, you have to get lighter to survive.
827000	831000	So these things can change so fast, and they can change in so many ways
831000	834000	that they're not good guides to what is related to what.
834000	842000	So the only time family resemblances imply a tree is when the change along these branches
842000	848000	is in characters that are so rare that it's amazing they ever occurred,
848000	852000	and if they're lost, they're gone forever.
852000	859000	So the reason Gould sees accident is that Gould's life was understanding the structure and the relations of this tree,
859000	863000	which is a thing that emphasizes the accidental parts of life.
863000	867000	But we still have to understand why anything about life is so accidental
867000	870000	that it would make a tree, that the family relations would be that.
870000	873000	And to understand that, we have to go down to the molecular level.
873000	876000	So this is now the world of Cric and Mono.
876000	880000	What Cric discovered with the double helix structure of DNA
880000	883000	was that you have a positive and a negative of the same information,
883000	887000	which can be split and copied without being used up,
887000	891000	and that's how changes can be passed on from a mother to a daughter
891000	894000	when in the case of cells the mother divides.
894000	899000	Now at the same time, either the positive or the negative can be used
899000	902000	as a source of instructions to control the cell,
902000	907000	and that's how the hereditary information that's passed down is expressed in us.
907000	912000	But the thing that's important here is this is like a company
912000	916000	whose commander only gives commands and never listens to feedback.
916000	919000	The only way you know whether they were good ideas or not
919000	921000	is whether the company lives or dies.
921000	925000	This is what implies accident because it says that it's only the accidental changes
925000	928000	in the course of living or in the course of dividing
928000	930000	that cause organisms to gradually change,
930000	932000	and then those changes are inherited,
932000	935000	and the only thing that determines what we see today
935000	937000	is which changes lived and which ones didn't.
937000	939000	This is Darwin's idea,
939000	942000	and of course what Cric and Watson recognized
942000	944000	is that this is the molecular basis
944000	947000	that gives substance to Darwin's empirical observations.
947000	949000	But I'll point out to you here,
949000	954000	this is the description of life at the level of control and inheritance.
954000	958000	Of course, if we have a moment of common sense,
958000	961000	we remember that there's more to life than control.
961000	964000	What I want to do is now broaden the picture,
964000	966000	ask what else is in life,
966000	971000	and then start to dig down in a different area that maybe is more fruitful.
971000	973000	What I want to show you here,
973000	975000	life is not just one thing.
975000	978000	It's not just one level of structure or just one kind of organization.
978000	982000	It's many things and they're all different and they all work together.
982000	984000	Just to give you a lay of the land,
984000	986000	I'll review what some of them are,
986000	988000	and then I'll tell you which ones I want to focus on.
988000	993000	First thing, life lives in the non-living world of rocks in the atmosphere.
993000	998000	In the non-living world, your carbon comes in the form of carbon dioxide molecules mostly.
998000	1001000	That's what these little stunted butterflies are supposed to be,
1001000	1003000	pictures of carbon dioxide.
1003000	1006000	The first thing life has to do is make carbon-carbon bonds,
1006000	1010000	which it does by making a certain set of small molecules.
1010000	1013000	There are many of these about 250 and they're not very big,
1013000	1015000	between 5 and 20 carbon atoms.
1015000	1019000	This is a whole structure of chemistry that's called core metabolism,
1019000	1021000	and that'll be the hero of our story tonight.
1021000	1023000	But for a moment, let me go on.
1023000	1026000	You make little atoms one carbon at a time.
1026000	1029000	When you make big atoms, you do something different.
1029000	1032000	You stitch the little atoms together like beads on a necklace.
1032000	1035000	This is where you get the big molecules, the DNA and the proteins,
1035000	1039000	that can have tens or hundreds of thousands of atoms, in some cases even millions.
1039000	1041000	Of course, that's not all.
1041000	1044000	The big molecules have to be physically stuck together to make the structures of cells.
1044000	1046000	That's a different organizational problem.
1046000	1049000	Now, for some living things, that's as far as it goes,
1049000	1051000	your one cell and that's your life.
1051000	1055000	For others, you get many cells that group together to make a plant or an animal.
1055000	1057000	That's another problem of organization.
1057000	1062000	For most of us, we live in an ecosystem where we have relations to all the other organisms.
1062000	1065000	That's another problem of coordination and organization.
1065000	1071000	The ecosystems together on the earth feedback and change its basic geological chemistry.
1071000	1076000	All this is going on, these things are very different in their dynamics.
1076000	1080000	We shouldn't be thinking that one idea of control explains all of them.
1080000	1086000	The remarkable thing is, if we look at these things from the perspective of chance and necessity,
1086000	1090000	we find that in fact they lay at very different places.
1090000	1096000	The benchmark for what I'll call necessity is the chemistry of the rocks and the atmosphere and the oceans.
1096000	1099000	On any planet like the earth, it's going to be the same.
1099000	1101000	There's not much that's accidental to it.
1101000	1106000	It's very steady, we can predict what the minerals are and we understand it with our science.
1106000	1110000	At the opposite end of this is any individual species.
1110000	1116000	The fact that there should happen to have been a large flightless pigeon on Mauritius is an infinite accident.
1116000	1120000	The fact that it didn't survive unfortunately is the most likely thing.
1120000	1122000	This is Gould's world of contingency.
1122000	1125000	All the things that almost never were and never will be again.
1125000	1127000	Here, of course, they're variable.
1127000	1129000	They fluctuate like crazy.
1129000	1132000	This is Doug Irwin's lecture a few months ago on extinctions.
1132000	1134000	We have a hard time predicting them.
1134000	1137000	This is Gould, Mono, and Crick, their statements.
1137000	1139000	Here's what's neat.
1139000	1142000	Biology is not all piled up against the contingent end.
1142000	1145000	If I ask about the small molecules here,
1145000	1149000	these are almost as steady as the chemistry of the rocks.
1149000	1154000	The same set of about 250 of them is in every living thing in the world
1154000	1159000	and appears to have been the same for all of history, almost four billion years.
1159000	1163000	So it's like a feature of the geosphere.
1163000	1168000	DNA, well, chemically DNA has been around probably since fairly close to the beginning
1168000	1170000	and RNA even closer than that.
1170000	1174000	But when this contains instructions for how to make these chemicals,
1174000	1177000	the instructions can change all over the place.
1177000	1180000	The chemicals do not change and the pathways do not change.
1180000	1184000	So all of a sudden control is looking like maybe it's not the most important thing.
1184000	1187000	Maybe getting the answer is the important thing
1187000	1190000	and you have some freedom in how you do it with control.
1190000	1192000	Cells are fairly regular,
1192000	1195000	but there's a significant amount of variability in them over history.
1195000	1199000	And ecosystems, if I could have drawn them, should cover this entire span
1199000	1202000	because the accidents of how we live together in an ecosystem
1202000	1205000	are among the most fragile things that are parts of life.
1205000	1209000	And yet the chemistry of ecosystems, which is the chemistry of these molecules,
1209000	1212000	goes all the way back here to the oldest things we know.
1216000	1221000	So in fact, if we want to understand the predictable parts of life,
1221000	1225000	we should be looking at metabolism as the bridge between the rock chemistry
1225000	1228000	and the early stages of life and the part that we can predict.
1228000	1231000	But in order to do that, we need a science of metabolism
1231000	1234000	which is going to be different from the science of control.
1234000	1237000	So let me start back looking at the things that are alive again
1237000	1240000	and show you how you would think about their organisation in metabolic terms.
1240000	1245000	Turns out two questions will answer a huge fraction of what you need to know.
1245000	1247000	One is where you get your energy,
1247000	1251000	and the second is do you depend on other living things for your own survival?
1251000	1253000	And there are two choices to each.
1253000	1256000	So biochemistry 101 in 30 seconds.
1256000	1260000	All of life is driven by energetic electrons
1260000	1264000	and the only question about where you get your energy is where you get your electrons.
1264000	1266000	There turn out to be two choices.
1266000	1269000	There are molecules that release energy by giving electrons away
1269000	1274000	and the metabolisms that run on that energy are what I call reductive here.
1274000	1276000	And both of these are of that kind.
1276000	1278000	And I'll tell you what they are in a minute.
1278000	1283000	This little guy lives at almost the temperature of boiling water in volcanoes under the deep sea.
1283000	1287000	This is botulism, which when I was a kid was not a cosmetic,
1287000	1292000	it was a deadly poison that you tried not to get in your canned goods.
1292000	1296000	The other option besides reductive metabolisms are oxidative metabolisms
1296000	1300000	where the energy comes from pulling electrons to the environment.
1300000	1305000	Oxidative metabolisms are things like the blue-green algae that give the ocean its greenish colour
1305000	1309000	and everything most people think about life is down in this corner.
1309000	1313000	The animals, the plants, the fungi, everything big enough to see without a microscope.
1313000	1315000	Now here's the interesting thing.
1315000	1321000	The oxygen in the world that is the foundation for this way of life was produced by living things.
1321000	1323000	It was not always here.
1323000	1327000	So this whole way of life didn't exist at the beginning of the world
1327000	1331000	and didn't exist at significant complexity until quite late,
1331000	1334000	probably half of the age of the earth.
1334000	1339000	Now the other distinction we can make is whether or not you need anything else in the world.
1339000	1342000	There are organisms, both of these kinds,
1342000	1347000	which basically can do every chemical thing they need in a world with no other living thing.
1347000	1350000	What a life it must be, especially if you're just one cell,
1350000	1354000	you know, no communication, no competition,
1354000	1357000	but they can do what none of the rest of us can do.
1357000	1362000	These guys are called autotrophs from the Greek roots meaning self-feeding.
1362000	1365000	The alternative to being an autotroph is to be a heterotroph.
1365000	1369000	You have to live in an ecology because your own chemistry is incomplete
1369000	1372000	and you have to have the ecology providing things for you.
1372000	1375000	And we, of course, are the ultimate heterotrophs.
1375000	1377000	We need everything.
1378000	1382000	But in fact, what I did here was a little bit of a sleight of hand.
1382000	1384000	I did the thing people always do.
1384000	1387000	I looked at individual species and individual organisms.
1387000	1389000	That wasn't the right thing to do.
1389000	1391000	It turns out to be a distraction.
1391000	1394000	Because if I look at the ecosystem level,
1394000	1398000	the whole ecology together, things become even simpler.
1399000	1402000	By definition, every ecology, because it's self-contained,
1402000	1404000	has to do all of its own chemistry.
1404000	1406000	So every ecology is autotrophic.
1406000	1410000	The remarkable thing that you get from studying biochemistry
1410000	1415000	is the knowledge that other than this division,
1415000	1418000	there's essentially no variability at the ecosystem level
1418000	1422000	in the chemistry of life, which means that...
1422000	1424000	I mean, this is the Tolstoy quote.
1424000	1426000	All autotrophic ecosystems are essentially alike,
1426000	1429000	but every heterotrophic organism is heterotrophic in its own way.
1432000	1435000	If you are a reductive ecology, like one of these sulfur swamps
1435000	1438000	that you get in volcanic hot springs,
1438000	1442000	then you're living off of electrons that come from the geochemical reactions.
1442000	1445000	If you're an oxidative ecology, there's a little bit more variability.
1445000	1448000	You're living ultimately off of energy that comes from sunlight
1448000	1450000	and the ability to produce oxygen.
1450000	1452000	But here's the more remarkable thing.
1452000	1454000	Chemically, these things look like opposites.
1454000	1457000	Either the environment gives you electrons where it pulls them in.
1457000	1460000	It turns out that in the structure of life,
1460000	1463000	this is not just an opposition, it's a hierarchy.
1463000	1466000	Because the universal chemistry that is in these guys
1466000	1469000	is a subset of what's in these guys.
1469000	1473000	Oxidative life is reductive life wrapped up in a spacesuit
1473000	1475000	that's able to capture sunlight.
1476000	1480000	So what that means is that even though on the earth today
1480000	1482000	there are environments with almost no oxygen
1482000	1484000	down in the deep seas around volcanoes
1484000	1486000	and environments with locks of oxygen,
1486000	1488000	like up here where we live,
1488000	1492000	you can also look at this as a picture back in time.
1492000	1494000	Because back at the very beginning,
1494000	1497000	when there was not yet life to have made oxygen,
1497000	1500000	the only kind of life there was was the reductive life.
1500000	1503000	And in these very simple organisms,
1503000	1506000	basically building biomass is enough to be alive.
1507000	1510000	This may have happened as long as almost four billion years ago
1510000	1512000	within a couple hundred million years
1512000	1514000	of when the ocean stopped boiling off.
1514000	1516000	So it basically was a snap of a finger.
1516000	1518000	It happened as quickly as it could.
1518000	1520000	Probably somewhat later,
1520000	1523000	and this is the biggest uncertainty in the talk,
1523000	1526000	when this happened is unknown to a billion years or more.
1526000	1528000	But at some point organisms started to realize
1528000	1531000	that there was huge energy in sunlight if they could capture it.
1531000	1534000	And they started to couple that to building their core metabolism,
1534000	1536000	and they started producing oxygen.
1536000	1539000	Took a long time though for the oxygen to build up
1539000	1542000	and only when there was a lot did you start getting the things
1542000	1544000	we think about as life, complex cell forms,
1544000	1547000	multi-cell organisms, all that stuff.
1547000	1549000	Now here's the striking thing.
1549000	1552000	Oxygen, when it first was introduced, was a waste product.
1552000	1554000	It was a worst poison for life
1554000	1557000	than anything any of us has ever imagined.
1557000	1559000	And yet this chemistry did not end.
1559000	1563000	It was preserved and it has been preserved all the way up to the present.
1564000	1566000	So.
1566000	1569000	I've just thrown a huge amount of stuff at you in five slides.
1569000	1572000	I think maybe that's appropriate because life is complicated.
1572000	1575000	And we said that if we want to avoid the mistakes of the past,
1575000	1578000	we don't want to oversimplify by ignoring things at the beginning.
1578000	1580000	We want to look at it all,
1580000	1583000	and then we want to see what looks like it doesn't depend on chance,
1583000	1587000	and we want to let universality and stability be our guide.
1587000	1590000	So we've been able to boil the story down
1590000	1593000	to focusing on the core molecules of biochemistry
1593000	1596000	and what we use to build our own biomass.
1596000	1599000	So at this point, we're still in the middle of a treasure hunt.
1599000	1602000	We think we know what we're after, but there hasn't been an aha.
1602000	1604000	That's for the next slide.
1604000	1606000	But here's the cool thing.
1606000	1608000	If you were to watch a movie,
1608000	1610000	and one of the characters were to open up a treasure map
1610000	1612000	that has five arrows pointing to someplace saying,
1612000	1614000	here it is, this is it,
1614000	1616000	you would say, okay, that's not a very subtle movie.
1616000	1618000	What kind of a character needs that?
1618000	1622000	What I'm about to show you is that the map of biochemistry
1622000	1626000	is a treasure map with five arrows pointing to here it is,
1626000	1629000	and it's been known since the 1960s.
1629000	1632000	But people only started to recognize what they were seeing
1632000	1635000	within about the last 25 years.
1635000	1640000	So this is what is universal about the way we build all of our biomolecules.
1640000	1643000	Biochemistry itself is not super complicated.
1643000	1646000	If you ask what we are made of, we're made of five classes of things,
1646000	1648000	and we know all of them because we have to eat them.
1648000	1651000	Because you remember I said we're metabolically incomplete.
1651000	1655000	So we need the fatty acids because otherwise we can't make cells.
1655000	1657000	That's your olive oil.
1657000	1660000	We need the amino acids, which we know from meringue and marshmallow
1660000	1662000	and things like that.
1662000	1664000	That's the structure and the enzymes and all that good stuff.
1664000	1666000	We need sugars.
1666000	1668000	Turns out they're probably more important for structure
1668000	1671000	than they are for energy storage, but we like them for the other thing.
1671000	1676000	Very, very important set of about 20 to 30 little molecules
1676000	1679000	which do all of our sort of super fine chemistry.
1679000	1682000	Like the chlorophyll that allows plants to capture sunlight
1682000	1685000	or the heme that allows us to do respiration.
1685000	1689000	And then of course there are the nucleic acids, the molecules of heredity.
1689000	1694000	Now there are 250 or 300 basic molecules that these are built up from.
1694000	1696000	But here is the kicker.
1696000	1700000	Every molecule in every living thing in all the world for all time
1700000	1705000	has been synthesized from one of these 11 molecules in this cycle.
1705000	1709000	Now when we were in high school a lot of us were taught about the Krebs cycle.
1709000	1714000	And of course there was the million dollar, billion dollar point here
1714000	1718000	which was ignored and something of almost no importance that we were told.
1718000	1724000	We were told that the Krebs cycle is important because we use it to break down sugars to get energy.
1724000	1729000	The Krebs cycle is important because everything in the entire history of life
1729000	1733000	has used it as the starting point to build every biomolecule.
1733000	1735000	No exceptions.
1735000	1740000	We came along 2.5 billion, well single cells came along 2.5 billion years later
1740000	1743000	and used it to get energy.
1743000	1745000	But we're borrowers in that sense.
1745000	1749000	So it may be obvious now that I think this is where life started
1749000	1753000	but now that we have this chemical framework I can also tell you why
1753000	1755000	I think life had to start this way.
1755000	1760000	Which is a question that we can ask in chemistry in a way that we could not before.
1760000	1765000	So in biology the struggle has always been when you think in terms of control
1765000	1768000	how do you explain why something is there?
1768000	1772000	Because when we think why is something there we always think what is it good for?
1772000	1775000	Well what is it good for is a purpose based question
1775000	1778000	and it's not clear that it came up because it was good for anything.
1778000	1780000	It came up for a different reason.
1780000	1784000	In chemistry we're not so susceptible to that error
1784000	1789000	because in chemistry we're used to saying what was it getting away from?
1789000	1795000	So a new way to ask about why life emerged is to say what was wrong with a non-living earth?
1795000	1799000	What was so wrong that could have driven it to have to change
1799000	1803000	and why was that change in the direction that led toward life?
1803000	1805000	And that's the thing that I think we can answer
1805000	1809000	or that we can at least pose good questions to that are testable in the laboratory.
1809000	1812000	So that's what I'll tell you about in what's left.
1814000	1821000	Turns out what we appeal to for understanding is the thing that's the most familiar of all.
1821000	1825000	If you put enough stress on something it will break.
1825000	1829000	And it turns out that the essential math and also the essential intuition I care about
1829000	1832000	for the origin of life is the intuition of breakdown.
1832000	1836000	Now the thing that might be non or sort of counterintuitive
1836000	1838000	if you've been wondering about the origin of life
1838000	1842000	you don't normally think of the origin of life as the breaking of a lifeless earth.
1842000	1847000	So the two things that I have to show you is there's more than one way for things to break down
1847000	1853000	and then second sometimes the process of breakdown is a process of creating new structure
1853000	1858000	and creating accident where there was only formlessness before.
1858000	1862000	But you'll be surprised as familiar as crack propagation is to us
1862000	1865000	these other two facts about breakdown are equally familiar.
1867000	1869000	One of them we know all the time
1869000	1872000	because lightning of course is a breakdown of the atmosphere.
1872000	1877000	It's not a mechanical breakdown but instead it's an electrical breakdown.
1877000	1881000	The thing that we need if we want to understand why life emerged
1881000	1884000	is to understand where the stress came from
1884000	1888000	and why it results in one kind of breakdown instead of another.
1888000	1891000	So if you want to understand lightning you say
1891000	1895000	that storm systems pull charges apart between the clouds and the ground
1895000	1899000	and that creates an electrical stress for the charges to try to recombine.
1899000	1904000	The ordinary dry atmosphere which is the preferred configuration
1904000	1910000	can't do that transport but the creation of the plasma channel of the lightning bolt
1910000	1914000	can do that transport and that's what sustains the plasma channel.
1914000	1918000	Now we can't predict exactly the track it will take, that's contingent, that's accidental
1918000	1923000	but we can very well predict the chemistry of this plasma channel.
1923000	1927000	So the analogy here and it's better than an analogy, it's a scientific equivalence
1927000	1934000	is that our biochemistry is like the altered state that is the plasma channel
1934000	1938000	within the lightning bolt and it was driven into existence in something like the same way.
1938000	1942000	Now lightning is not an ideal example here because it's gone in a short time
1942000	1944000	and we don't think of it as lasting for very long
1944000	1949000	even though on the scale of the processes that make it it's plenty long lived.
1950000	1952000	But there are other examples.
1952000	1955000	Hurricanes are another kind of a breakdown of the atmosphere.
1955000	1958000	This is not a breakdown of the electrical structure of the atmosphere,
1958000	1960000	it's a breakdown of the thermal structure.
1960000	1963000	What I'm showing you here is a set of hurricane tracks
1963000	1967000	which you can see transporting heat out of the tropical oceans
1967000	1970000	and into the temperate and polar upper atmospheres.
1970000	1973000	This is what drives the hurricane system as of course people now understand
1973000	1977000	and appreciate in a way that they did in a little while back.
1977000	1983000	This is a channel that has the ability to pull in heat
1983000	1986000	in order to reinforce its own structure
1986000	1991000	and the wall storms of the hurricane are transporting that heat from the ocean to the upper atmosphere.
1991000	1995000	But in order to do that they have to break the smooth layered structure
1995000	1998000	that the atmospheric temperature usually has.
1999000	2004000	So if we want to understand the emergence of life, was it a chemical breakdown,
2004000	2006000	what we have to ask is where did that happen
2006000	2009000	and what was the stress that would have caused it to happen.
2009000	2012000	And now we're talking about stress in a chemical sense.
2012000	2015000	So my good friend and colleague Harold Morowitz,
2015000	2019000	who is much older than I, also has an infinite gift for words.
2019000	2023000	And he has recognized, that's why he's written something like eight or nine books
2023000	2026000	that are revered around the world and I recommend any of them to you.
2026000	2031000	But he's recognized that theories of the origin of life can be divided into two categories.
2031000	2034000	There are the heaven theories and the hell theories.
2034000	2036000	You can already guess which one I'll like.
2038000	2041000	But it turns out that this has a basis.
2041000	2044000	They're distinguished according to where the energy comes from
2044000	2047000	in the life forms that use it today.
2047000	2049000	The heaven theories are all of the theories
2049000	2052000	whose energy ultimately comes from sunlight or starlight.
2052000	2056000	The idea is that there's so much energy in this
2056000	2060000	that it can do the chemistry of forming carbon-carbon bonds.
2060000	2062000	So it can produce the small molecules.
2062000	2066000	This can happen on the surfaces of asteroids, which then fall on the earth.
2066000	2068000	It can happen in the ices of comets.
2068000	2072000	In some small amount, the sunlight drives the weather system
2072000	2075000	and a little bit of the energy from weather winds up in the lightning bolt
2075000	2077000	and that can do a little bit of chemistry.
2077000	2080000	This was what the Miller-Urey experiment showed
2080000	2082000	that was so exciting to people
2082000	2086000	and that got the origin of life started as a scientific question.
2086000	2091000	And all of these stories that have to do with this sort of sunlight-yielded chemistry
2091000	2094000	are the things that we associate with the primordial soup.
2094000	2099000	Now, this appealed to people when there was no other idea in town,
2099000	2101000	but there are a lot of problems with it.
2101000	2103000	Sunlight is a tremendous energy source,
2103000	2107000	but it's not easy to use because it tends to destroy things.
2107000	2113000	And so, in fact, it's much easier to understand the way sunlight is used today
2113000	2116000	if that happens somewhat later on when there was already life in place
2116000	2119000	with the complexity to capture it.
2119000	2123000	Another problem with the primordial soup is that you need to finish life
2123000	2126000	before the soup is done, so you're on the clock.
2126000	2130000	The idea is that, in the classical scenarios,
2130000	2134000	heaven deposits organic materials on the surface of the ocean
2134000	2137000	and accidental chemistry gives you a control mechanism
2137000	2141000	and then you have the keys to life itself, the DNA or whatever,
2141000	2144000	but then you have to build the whole life underneath of this
2144000	2147000	before you have used all of the soup.
2147000	2149000	So, that's unappealing.
2149000	2153000	The thing that, to me, is the biggest problem with these ideas
2153000	2155000	is that, in this chemistry,
2155000	2158000	there's no special place for the biochemistry we see,
2158000	2161000	and there's no special reason to exclude all of the things
2161000	2163000	that are not in our biochemistry.
2163000	2167000	So, it's not clear to me that this is very tightly coupled to who we are.
2167000	2170000	And since the whole point of exploring biochemistry
2170000	2172000	was that that was the thing to be explained,
2172000	2174000	I think we should expect a coupling.
2174000	2177000	And that's where the hell theory comes in.
2177000	2181000	This is the theory, particularly associated with hydrothermal vents.
2181000	2184000	These can be volcanoes, but they can be quieter things
2184000	2187000	that involve magma and water under the deep ocean.
2187000	2189000	There can be many different kinds.
2189000	2191000	You can have these guys which are alkaline
2191000	2194000	and which are full of carbon dioxide, but not too much metal.
2194000	2196000	These are called white smokers,
2196000	2198000	and they occur in not the hottest places.
2198000	2201000	These are about at the boiling temperature of water a little bit cooler.
2201000	2204000	These guys can be 600 degrees Fahrenheit
2204000	2208000	or 300 degrees Celsius, roughly,
2208000	2210000	and they thunder along at the bottom of the ocean.
2210000	2213000	They're black because they're full of metal and sulfur.
2213000	2215000	They're full of carbon dioxide. They're full of hydrogen.
2215000	2218000	In particular, they're full of all of the chemicals
2218000	2220000	that life needs to exist,
2220000	2223000	but they are not full of primordial soup.
2223000	2226000	And oddly enough, that turns out to be an advantage.
2226000	2230000	And I'll show you why in the next slide.
2230000	2232000	Oh, I should mention to you
2232000	2234000	that there are whole ecosystems that live down here.
2234000	2236000	The little grey guy that I told you can live all by itself
2236000	2238000	with no other living thing.
2238000	2240000	They live down here in this range,
2240000	2243000	and they do exactly the chemistry I'm going to tell you
2243000	2245000	I think was being done four billion years ago
2245000	2247000	before there was life.
2249000	2252000	If you want to understand what was wrong with a lifeless earth,
2252000	2254000	then you say what was the problem.
2254000	2256000	Here's the problem.
2256000	2258000	The geochemistry creates carbon dioxide,
2258000	2260000	and it creates hydrogen.
2260000	2262000	Now, hydrogen has electrons
2262000	2264000	that it can give to carbon or oxygen,
2264000	2266000	and if it were to give them,
2266000	2269000	so you put as many hydrogens as will fit around a carbon
2269000	2271000	to make methane,
2271000	2273000	you put as many hydrogens as will fit around an oxygen
2273000	2275000	to make water,
2275000	2278000	that is the most energy that's available from this system.
2278000	2280000	You look at this picture and you say,
2280000	2282000	well, how hard could it be?
2282000	2284000	Well, it turns out it's very hard.
2284000	2286000	It's harder than any non-living thing
2286000	2288000	can do at an appreciable rate,
2288000	2291000	but living things do it with superb efficiency.
2291000	2295000	So what life on earth is today doing,
2295000	2297000	among other things,
2297000	2299000	these geochemical processes
2299000	2301000	are generating all this energetic stuff,
2301000	2304000	but it would build up and build up and build up
2304000	2306000	in the absence of life.
2306000	2309000	Life consumes it, provides this downhill run
2309000	2311000	to lower energy molecules.
2311000	2314000	So the idea behind the lightning strike
2314000	2316000	is that this stress, when there was no life,
2316000	2318000	built up and built up
2318000	2320000	and created a lightning strike through chemistry
2320000	2322000	to make this possible.
2325000	2327000	But what does that have to do with biochemistry?
2327000	2330000	All I showed you was carbon dioxide and methane.
2330000	2332000	Here's a surprising thing that's a little different
2332000	2334000	than we're used to thinking of.
2334000	2336000	I told you that there are organisms that live
2336000	2338000	in these hydrogen environments,
2338000	2341000	the reducing environments that give electrons.
2341000	2343000	They're doing this chemistry
2343000	2347000	and they have essentially nothing more than biosynthesis.
2347000	2349000	Their energy capture is very limited.
2349000	2351000	It's much less than a tenth of what any of us
2351000	2353000	use up in the air-breathing world.
2353000	2358000	The surprising thing is that in order to get from here to here,
2358000	2362000	the best way is to go through the molecules of life.
2362000	2364000	So what this picture is, you can think of this
2364000	2367000	as being the chemical equivalent of a ball rolling down a hill
2367000	2369000	and it has the same mathematical meaning.
2369000	2371000	What I'm showing you here is the starting point
2371000	2373000	when no chemistry has been done,
2373000	2377000	the ending point when all of the energy has been extracted,
2377000	2380000	and across here is how far you've gone
2380000	2382000	in transferring those hydrogens.
2382000	2386000	It turns out that there are no ways through little molecules
2386000	2390000	to go from here to here that are as energy efficient and simple
2390000	2393000	as going through these molecules,
2393000	2395000	which are the ones in the cycle I showed you.
2395000	2397000	You don't need to worry about the names,
2397000	2399000	but if you want to know why is there sugar,
2399000	2403000	there's sugar because sugar is downhill from the stuff that makes sugar.
2403000	2407000	If you want to understand why there's oil, including petroleum,
2407000	2409000	it's because oil is on the way to methane
2409000	2411000	if you have enough hydrogen to make it.
2411000	2414000	And so what I'm telling you, the chemistry was doing here,
2414000	2418000	is exactly what these little guys are doing
2418000	2421000	at the base of that hydrothermal vent that I showed you.
2421000	2424000	Incidentally, if I had remembered to point it out on the tree,
2424000	2427000	you remember that some of the organisms seem to connect in
2427000	2429000	very, very close to the root.
2429000	2432000	Unlike us, we're kind of connected way out here in the leaves.
2432000	2434000	This is one of them.
2434000	2436000	This connects all the way down at the bottom.
2436000	2439000	Lives a few degrees below the boiling temperature of water.
2439000	2442000	Seems to have ancestors that could be at least 3 billion years old
2442000	2445000	before it has a common ancestry with anything else.
2445000	2448000	Does this simple chemistry is completely self-contained
2448000	2450000	and does nothing else?
2450000	2452000	So this is the kind of model we're looking at
2452000	2454000	for the chemistry of the origin of life.
2454000	2456000	Now, you shouldn't believe me yet,
2456000	2458000	even if you might believe me in a minute,
2458000	2462000	because I just told you that all of this chemistry is hard.
2462000	2466000	So where did any of this stuff come from if it's so hard to do?
2466000	2470000	And that's what's special about the cycle at the core of biochemistry
2470000	2472000	with all the arrows pointing to it.
2474000	2477000	Because that cycle is the chemical equivalent of the hurricane.
2477000	2479000	So here's the cycle again.
2479000	2481000	I didn't know how to show it to you
2481000	2483000	without making it sort of sleep inducing.
2483000	2486000	But this is actually the chemical diagram
2486000	2488000	showing where carbon dioxide's come in,
2488000	2490000	where hydrogen's come in, where waters are given off,
2490000	2492000	and so on, and we go round and round the cycle.
2492000	2494000	And we go around it in this picture the same way
2494000	2496000	as the hurricane goes around it.
2496000	2498000	By the way, if you have kids in school
2498000	2500000	and they come home telling you that the Krebs cycle
2500000	2502000	is the citric acid cycle,
2502000	2504000	tell them, wait till they grow up.
2504000	2506000	Because this thing is called by some people
2506000	2508000	the reverse citric acid cycle.
2508000	2510000	This is the real citric acid cycle.
2510000	2512000	This was here 4 billion years ago.
2512000	2514000	We run the reverse citric acid cycle.
2514000	2517000	That came along only when there was oxygen much later.
2517000	2520000	But the important thing about this cycle is this.
2520000	2522000	The chemistry of these molecules
2522000	2524000	is chemistry that's like flypaper.
2524000	2527000	It's suited to take in a carbon dioxide or a hydrogen
2527000	2529000	even if they couldn't react with each other.
2529000	2531000	And so as you go around the cycle,
2531000	2533000	the molecules get bigger and bigger
2533000	2535000	and bigger as they take in carbon.
2535000	2538000	And then when they get here, they split.
2538000	2541000	And you get two molecules where before you had one.
2541000	2544000	So now you can take in twice as much carbon.
2544000	2546000	And it splits again.
2546000	2548000	And now you can take in four times as much carbon.
2548000	2550000	So this is like compound interest.
2550000	2552000	Or like the chain reaction that was, of course,
2552000	2555000	made famous by Los Alamos some decades ago.
2555000	2557000	Or the hair commercial where she told two people
2557000	2559000	and so on and so on.
2559000	2562000	The thing that's important about these kinds of cycles is
2562000	2565000	that even if you have only a very rare event
2565000	2567000	to form one of these molecules,
2567000	2569000	if you have self-amplification,
2569000	2571000	that can cause all of your carbon
2571000	2573000	and all of your energy flow
2573000	2575000	to get sucked into one cycle.
2575000	2578000	Just like you never find two hurricanes
2578000	2580000	in exactly the same place,
2580000	2583000	because any one of them is pulling all of the local energy in
2583000	2585000	from the ocean where it is.
2585000	2589000	So that's pretty much the story.
2589000	2591000	I'm not going to tell you that all of it is fact,
2591000	2593000	that all of it's established,
2593000	2595000	but all of it is experimentally testable.
2595000	2598000	And there are several things that I think it allows us to think
2598000	2601000	that are different than have been thought before,
2601000	2604000	probably more common sense and maybe more useful.
2604000	2607000	Metabolism first, not control first.
2607000	2610000	Control is complicated if it had to come on a background of nothing
2610000	2612000	that would seem like almost a miracle,
2612000	2615000	but it doesn't exist on a background of almost nothing today.
2615000	2617000	It exists on a background of metabolism,
2617000	2620000	and metabolism is old.
2620000	2623000	Life arose and persists in order to enable metabolism.
2623000	2625000	This is the lightning strike argument.
2625000	2627000	Think about how different this is
2627000	2629000	than the way we usually think.
2629000	2633000	We usually think that metabolism exists in order to enable life.
2633000	2636000	That's the sort of purpose-oriented thinking.
2636000	2638000	In the chemical domain,
2638000	2641000	you get a completely different idea of what life even is.
2641000	2644000	Life is what can be built out of those 11 molecules
2644000	2647000	when you have this amplifying cycle
2647000	2650000	spewing them out from geochemistry.
2650000	2653000	We get, to me, the very pleasing idea
2653000	2656000	that the emergence of life was a form of collapse.
2656000	2658000	The important thing about this is
2658000	2661000	that things do not come up off of the floor
2661000	2663000	and rearrange themselves on the table.
2663000	2666000	So if the transition from a non-living to a living earth
2666000	2668000	was actually a collapse,
2668000	2671000	that enables us to understand why life has been so stable.
2671000	2674000	Species go extinct, ecosystems rearrange.
2674000	2676000	Life has never winked out.
2676000	2678000	It's been continuous all the way back,
2678000	2680000	and the chemistry has been invariant.
2680000	2682000	This is a sensible way to look at that.
2682000	2684000	Of course, most of all,
2684000	2687000	the biosphere is no longer separate from the geosphere,
2687000	2689000	not in our thinking, not in our science.
2689000	2691000	Geochemistry is, in some sense,
2691000	2694000	the core of what we are and have always been.
2694000	2698000	The rest of us as living things is built around it.
2698000	2700000	There's contingency that comes in later.
2700000	2702000	There's all kinds of room for accident,
2702000	2704000	but this accident comes in
2704000	2708000	once there's a significant amount of structure already in place.
2708000	2711000	Thank you, and it'll be good to talk.
2711000	2714000	APPLAUSE
2719000	2720000	The first question is,
2720000	2722000	why do we not find it spontaneously emerging
2722000	2725000	in the remote parts of the world?
2725000	2728000	If the absence of life in those remote parts of the world
2728000	2731000	is explained by competition with existing forms of life,
2731000	2733000	which is the more common explanation,
2733000	2736000	then why is it so hard in a laboratory
2736000	2740000	and of highly idealised conditions to synthesise life?
2740000	2742000	Cool. Yeah, good. All good.
2744000	2747000	So the answer to the first question
2747000	2749000	is a thing that even Darwin had already recognised,
2749000	2751000	that in some sense,
2751000	2754000	when you have very modern forms that are very sophisticated,
2754000	2757000	it's difficult for the things that gave rise to those modern forms
2757000	2759000	to be recreated.
2759000	2760000	So for instance,
2760000	2763000	I'm trying to think of something in the technological realm,
2763000	2765000	if there's some tremendous amount of effort
2765000	2767000	that's required to make the first digital computer,
2767000	2770000	and it's as big as this room and uses as much electricity as a city,
2770000	2773000	and then you have that thing sitting over there on the desk.
2773000	2775000	People would not be willing to go through the same effort
2775000	2777000	to do the same difficult thing again,
2777000	2780000	once the efficient things are already there.
2780000	2783000	So I should be careful.
2783000	2786000	What you said the first time seems to be exactly right,
2786000	2788000	that we have never found any place where the process
2788000	2790000	of the emergence of life is being repeated,
2790000	2792000	but the second thing,
2792000	2794000	we've never found any place in the earth
2794000	2796000	that doesn't have something living there.
2796000	2799000	So you drill down as deep as you can in an oil well,
2799000	2802000	and you'll find bacteria and archaea living down there.
2802000	2804000	You go up into arctic ices, they're there.
2804000	2807000	Up in the atmosphere, they're up there feeding off dust particles.
2807000	2810000	So in some sense, anywhere there's energy in the world,
2810000	2812000	something is already grazing on it.
2812000	2815000	And I think most people do not expect
2815000	2820000	any catastrophic surprises in that area.
2820000	2823000	They think that we don't see the emergence of life again,
2823000	2825000	because current life is so much more efficient.
2825000	2827000	But then the question about the lab
2827000	2829000	really is pertinent to what we do.
2829000	2832000	And so the interesting thing is that
2832000	2835000	not only is life complex, but the geological world is complex.
2835000	2838000	And so here's the best thing we can do in the lab.
2838000	2840000	There are probably three guys in the United States
2840000	2843000	who can do it, and I'm privileged to be sort of
2843000	2846000	on the doorstep of one of them asking for what he knows.
2846000	2849000	You can take a fantastically expensive machine
2849000	2851000	that took you most of your career to build.
2851000	2854000	You can put a little bit of chemistry into a gold capsule.
2854000	2855000	You can seal it.
2855000	2857000	You can compress it to 300 atmospheres
2857000	2859000	and heat it to 200 degrees.
2859000	2862000	And then you can take it out and very carefully open it
2862000	2863000	and find out what happened.
2863000	2865000	And if you don't have the chemistry exactly right,
2865000	2866000	you can start over.
2866000	2870000	So compare that to what was happening in the early earth.
2870000	2875000	In the early earth, the mantle was more fluid,
2875000	2877000	and so there probably were no lasting continents.
2877000	2879000	It was constantly fractured.
2879000	2881000	The moon was as big as a dinner plate in the sky,
2881000	2883000	and the tides were once every six hours
2883000	2886000	and probably two kilometers high.
2886000	2888000	The entire ocean probably got cycled
2888000	2890000	through these hydrothermal systems
2890000	2892000	on the order of once every 1,000 years,
2892000	2895000	whereas today it's more like once every 100,000 years.
2895000	2898000	And I told you that there were two of these systems today
2898000	2900000	that are sort of separate and sort of different
2900000	2902000	with their unrelated chemistry.
2902000	2904000	One is alkaline, one is acid, one has low metals,
2904000	2906000	one has high metals.
2906000	2909000	In the early earth, the entire upper crust
2909000	2911000	was probably fractured with the ocean
2911000	2912000	infecting through it.
2912000	2914000	And the chemistry at that time
2914000	2916000	could have been any mix of any of these things.
2916000	2920000	So if we want to understand and recreate correctly
2920000	2922000	in the lab this organic chemistry,
2922000	2925000	we have to understand what type of chemical environment
2925000	2926000	we're looking in.
2926000	2928000	And that turns out to be a really hard search problem.
2928000	2931000	Works better if you have the entire crust of the earth
2931000	2933000	than if you have a little gold capsule
2933000	2937000	that holds less than this much of my finger of a liquid.
2937000	2941000	But I am hoping that I will live to see these experiments done.
2941000	2943000	I should tell you that for the citric acid,
2943000	2945000	the Krebs cycle that I showed you,
2945000	2948000	George Cody and Carnegie Institution in Washington
2948000	2950000	has already gotten big arcs of this cycle to go
2950000	2952000	even with his little capsule.
2952000	2954000	And so the question is whether at the places
2954000	2956000	where things are not working,
2956000	2958000	we're missing something about the mineral chemistry.
2958000	2960000	And I think that that's probably the case
2960000	2962000	and that it will probably be cracked.
2962000	2963000	OK.
2963000	2965000	So here's the next one.
2965000	2969000	It's probably the question that is maybe of greatest interest
2969000	2971000	to the most people.
2971000	2975000	And that is where does the inevitability end, right?
2975000	2978000	So in your spectrum, you know,
2978000	2981000	it would be a sort of rather disappointing take-home message
2981000	2984000	of inevitable life was basically the inevitability
2984000	2986000	of a bunch of small molecules.
2986000	2988000	And so the question is,
2988000	2993000	is there some possibility of identifying other regularities
2993000	2995000	and other processes that would make
2995000	2999000	more sophisticated, more complex structures inevitable too?
2999000	3002000	So, for example, you know, we watched Star Trek
3002000	3006000	and we encountered bipedal self-conscious extraterrestrials.
3006000	3009000	Are we going to be forever disappointed
3009000	3012000	and only ever encounter, you know, the Krebs cycle?
3012000	3014000	Or is there something about the theory,
3014000	3016000	or some theory that might be related to it,
3016000	3018000	that would say that more complex structures
3018000	3019000	would be inevitable too?
3019000	3021000	Wonderful. Yep.
3021000	3024000	So, of course, this is in some ways a disingenuous question
3024000	3027000	because this is what David and I work on together.
3027000	3030000	And this is also what Jeffrey West at the Institute works on.
3030000	3034000	We think there are all kinds of things that are very lawful
3034000	3036000	and that can only happen in more or less the way they do
3036000	3039000	at all kinds of structures throughout life.
3039000	3041000	I'll tell you about a couple in our work,
3041000	3043000	but I'll tell you about a couple others that are obvious
3043000	3045000	that are just kind of common knowledge.
3045000	3047000	All fish look more or less like fish,
3047000	3049000	and that's because they live in water.
3049000	3051000	It's out that if you look at diatoms,
3051000	3054000	these little tiny glass-encased things that are one or a few cells,
3054000	3056000	they don't look like fish at all,
3056000	3058000	but that's because they live at low Reynolds number.
3058000	3060000	And if you're a fluid mechanic and you look at diatoms,
3060000	3062000	they actually look all like each other,
3062000	3064000	sort of like snowflakes look like each other.
3064000	3067000	So, in some sense, there are rules that make fish fish
3067000	3069000	and that make diatoms diatoms.
3069000	3072000	Now, I didn't tell you much about what goes on at the chemistry
3072000	3074000	above this very basic cycle,
3074000	3077000	but I think that we will be able to show
3077000	3080000	that maybe 14 or 15 of the 20 amino acids that we use
3080000	3083000	had to be either as they are or somewhere pretty close,
3083000	3086000	because it turns out that they are the easiest chemistry
3086000	3088000	to do from these carbon backbones.
3088000	3091000	We think that a lot of the regularity that's in our genetic code
3091000	3094000	turns out to have had a chemical origin in the era
3094000	3097000	before there were cells, before there was any coding,
3097000	3099000	and that that probably is predictable.
3099000	3102000	Of course, Geoffrey's work on allymetric scaling says,
3102000	3105000	if you want to become multicellular and you have to feed yourself,
3105000	3107000	there are limits on how you can do that,
3107000	3109000	and that's why you do not have flying elephants
3109000	3112000	or little hummingbirds that live 100 years.
3112000	3114000	And so there are lots of regularities,
3114000	3117000	and the lovely thing is, like the structures of life,
3117000	3119000	they are not all alike.
3119000	3122000	They're very different, and they each come at different scales,
3122000	3124000	and yet once you stitch them all together,
3124000	3128000	a lot of times there's kind of a skeleton of regularity
3128000	3131000	and there's sense to the variations and the accidents
3131000	3133000	that can live around them.
3133000	3137000	Those things and necessity are not things that are separated by a gulf.
3137000	3140000	They're things that are constantly sort of interleaved.
3140000	3141000	So is that?
3141000	3142000	Good, yes.
3142000	3145000	So why don't we take some questions now from the audience?
3145000	3147000	There's one here, yes.
3147000	3151000	Have any of the cornology that's been found in our explorations
3151000	3153000	of the moon and Mars?
3153000	3155000	No.
3155000	3157000	We haven't looked for them in Mars,
3157000	3160000	but here's a point that maybe I could have made better in the talk.
3160000	3164000	When I say that we are coupled to the geosphere,
3164000	3167000	we really are coupled to the energy of the geosphere,
3167000	3171000	because having carbon and having nitrogen or oxygen or phosphorus or sulphur
3171000	3173000	is not enough to give you life.
3173000	3176000	You have to have an energy source that forces it to exist,
3176000	3178000	and the moon is a very low energy place,
3178000	3182000	and today even Mars is a very low energy place.
3182000	3186000	The moons of Jupiter are not low energy places.
3186000	3189000	They may be chemically different places from the earth,
3189000	3191000	but it's kind of like Alice in Wonderland.
3191000	3193000	It takes all the running you can do just to stay in place.
3193000	3196000	You'll have to run a lot harder than that to get anywhere.
3196000	3200000	It's taken all we can do to understand the chemistry that's in the life we know.
3200000	3205000	If the chemistry of the planet or the moon is different on Europa or on Titan,
3205000	3209000	it may turn out to be an equally hard problem where we don't have clues
3209000	3212000	to understand what we should look for there.
3212000	3216000	But if you can find me a planet whose rocks are like the earth,
3216000	3218000	and it comes from a second-generation star,
3218000	3220000	it's about at the same distance,
3220000	3222000	I will certainly go there looking for vinegar,
3222000	3225000	and looking for malic acid and citric acid,
3225000	3228000	and all these other good things that are even familiar.
3228000	3230000	They're so common.
3230000	3232000	Yeah, there's a question back there.
3232000	3236000	You may have answered this in his second question,
3236000	3238000	but in your tree of life,
3238000	3242000	everything went down in this root of the tree.
3242000	3245000	It's my understanding, and I'm not in this field,
3245000	3247000	that even in that trunk of the tree,
3247000	3250000	biologists presume that there's DNA, there's control,
3250000	3252000	even in our trunk.
3252000	3255000	So it must have happened very early,
3255000	3258000	as what you're saying, not as early as this,
3258000	3261000	but is DNA still in other places?
3261000	3264000	If we do find the predacypal on another planet,
3264000	3268000	are we going to find DNA on that planet?
3268000	3270000	I don't know about DNA.
3270000	3273000	I would bet more than 50 cents on RNA.
3273000	3276000	Depending on how many trillion dollars it costs us to go there,
3276000	3280000	then there's a question how much you would bet on RNA.
3280000	3282000	You have it exactly right,
3282000	3284000	and you raise two really important points,
3284000	3287000	because the oldest thing you can trace with a family tree
3287000	3290000	is a thing that has a structure of control.
3290000	3293000	So anything that happens before the structure of control,
3293000	3295000	even if it had a long time to happen,
3295000	3297000	the family tree will not enable you to know about,
3297000	3301000	because there was nothing to preserve those family resemblances.
3301000	3303000	Now, interesting thing,
3303000	3305000	DNA is really good for what it does,
3305000	3308000	and RNA is not so good for the things DNA does,
3308000	3311000	and there's a lot of chemical sense in DNA.
3311000	3314000	And it's interesting, it turns out that the sugar in DNA
3314000	3317000	is not very hard for an organic chemist to make
3317000	3320000	from some of the chemicals that I showed you there,
3320000	3323000	but that's not the way it's made in any living thing.
3323000	3326000	In every living thing, it's made from the sugar in RNA
3326000	3329000	via a much more complicated, difficult reaction.
3329000	3333000	I think what that tells us is that RNA was certainly there,
3333000	3335000	whether it was there a little before,
3335000	3337000	or a little after there were cells,
3337000	3339000	is a hard problem to be worked out,
3339000	3342000	and I would believe either one of those with a good argument.
3342000	3345000	DNA may have come, interesting possibility,
3345000	3349000	on the tree DNA could have come after the first branching.
3349000	3351000	There are some people who believe it did,
3351000	3355000	because the molecules that make, that copy DNA,
3355000	3358000	look to have been independently derived twice.
3358000	3360000	So it could be that, at the root,
3360000	3362000	there was actually an RNA organism,
3362000	3365000	and DNA was discovered for its value twice.
3367000	3369000	There's a question here.
3369000	3371000	Yeah.
3371000	3374000	My main recollection of the prep cycle
3374000	3384000	is that there are quite a few enzymes that they can go.
3384000	3386000	What about that?
3386000	3388000	That's the other wonderful part of the story
3388000	3390000	that, if I had been a chemist, I would have told you
3390000	3392000	instead of the story I told you today.
3392000	3396000	The enzymes in modern cells are so efficient.
3396000	3399000	They can increase the rate of reaction by millions,
3399000	3402000	or as much as hundreds of millions of times.
3402000	3406000	Now, there also tends to hundreds of thousands of atoms long,
3406000	3408000	so they probably didn't exist.
3408000	3410000	Because they're so good, and it's been so much work
3410000	3412000	to understand how they work,
3412000	3414000	almost all of our focus on catalysis
3414000	3417000	has focused on these very big, very sophisticated,
3417000	3420000	and relatively late molecules.
3420000	3422000	A thing that is now being discovered,
3422000	3424000	but needs to be much more explored,
3424000	3427000	is that small molecules can also be catalysts.
3427000	3429000	They're not nearly as good,
3429000	3431000	but they're also not nearly as hard to make.
3431000	3433000	And not only small molecules can be catalysts,
3433000	3435000	but mineral surfaces can be catalysts.
3435000	3437000	The people who know this better than anybody
3437000	3439000	are the petroleum engineers,
3439000	3441000	because they're the ones who use it to convert the grades
3441000	3443000	of gasoline and diesel and all that stuff.
3443000	3445000	And this is another place where there are tremendous fossils.
3445000	3449000	Much of the mineral chemistry that's good for hydrocracking
3449000	3452000	involves iron, sulfur, cobalt, and molybdenum,
3452000	3455000	some part of that is preserved in the enzymes
3455000	3458000	as the actual active site that either moves an electron
3458000	3460000	or moves a functional group.
3460000	3462000	And so, if we want to understand where the structure
3462000	3465000	to the chemistry came from and we need catalysis,
3465000	3468000	the place we need to look is in the small molecules themselves.
3468000	3470000	Starting with the minerals,
3470000	3472000	what can be done on the surfaces of exposed rock,
3472000	3474000	when those make small molecules,
3474000	3477000	what catalytic capabilities do those perform?
3477000	3479000	A few experiments have been done
3479000	3482000	with showing that every one of the amino acids
3482000	3485000	is catalytic for certain reactions that will make sugar.
3485000	3487000	And they're specific.
3487000	3489000	They not only enhance the rates,
3489000	3491000	but they do it in different ways for different molecules.
3491000	3493000	So this is a whole field of organic chemistry
3493000	3495000	that doesn't yet exist,
3495000	3497000	just because people haven't put a priority onto doing it.
3497000	3499000	But I hope that that's a thing
3499000	3501000	that within a small number of years
3501000	3503000	will become an active area of work.
3503000	3505000	There's a question behind you.
3505000	3507000	That, yes, you know.
3507000	3509000	A great volume of something up on the internet
3509000	3511000	of a supplementary researcher,
3511000	3513000	he said, was playing that
3513000	3516000	beings aren't dying in California
3516000	3519000	due to the genetic of modified organisms.
3519000	3521000	And that this person also claims
3521000	3523000	that this molecular interference
3523000	3525000	can have potential to destroy life
3525000	3527000	within six years.
3527000	3530000	Three-fourth that. Have you heard anything about this?
3530000	3532000	I heard something about cell phones
3532000	3535000	causing the colony disruption of bees.
3535000	3537000	Happily that's not an area
3537000	3539000	that it's my responsibility
3539000	3541000	to provide reliable answers on.
3541000	3544000	You got to appreciate that the stuff I'm doing
3544000	3547000	is simple enough that a physicist can understand it.
3547000	3549000	And the kind of questions that you're asking
3549000	3551000	are at such a higher level of complexity,
3551000	3553000	I don't really have the right tools
3553000	3555000	to address those kinds of questions,
3555000	3557000	because they're in the domain of accident.
3557000	3559000	And that's one of the things we work on
3559000	3562000	is how really do you think about a science
3562000	3564000	where history is an important part.
3566000	3568000	Have you heard of the...
3568000	3570000	Yes.
3570000	3573000	Yes, they have been here in the past.
3573000	3576000	They were only bigger and stronger than they are today.
3576000	3578000	Any given one might only last for a thousand years
3578000	3580000	or 10,000 years,
3580000	3583000	and then it dries up and a different one goes someplace else.
3583000	3586000	But I didn't mention this about the heaven and the hell theories.
3586000	3589000	The heaven theory turns out to come from nuclear fusion,
3589000	3591000	because that's what powers stars.
3591000	3593000	The hell theories come from nuclear fission,
3593000	3595000	because that's what keeps the inside of the planet hot.
3595000	3598000	And it's the process of getting rid of that excess heat
3598000	3602000	that causes the planet to convert heat energy into chemical energy.
3602000	3604000	And that's what's driving these things.
3604000	3607000	That's why there's a steady rich source of chemistry at those
3607000	3609000	that there may not be on the surface.
3609000	3611000	I'm going to take two more questions.
3611000	3613000	Yes.
3616000	3618000	You bet. You bet.
3618000	3620000	You know why?
3620000	3622000	Because there wasn't a self back then.
3622000	3624000	And that, to me, is one of the most important things
3624000	3627000	that should revise our understanding of biology.
3627000	3630000	The Darwinian Revolution took for granted
3630000	3633000	that we know what individuals are on the planet.
3633000	3636000	We know what individuals are on the planet.
3636000	3638000	We know what people are on the planet.
3638000	3640000	We know what people are on the planet.
3640000	3642000	We know what people are on the planet.
3642000	3644000	We know what people are on the planet.
3644000	3647000	We know for granted that we know what individuals are.
3647000	3651000	And that we know what it means for an individual to have offspring.
3651000	3654000	But in thermodynamics there are no individuals.
3654000	3656000	And so there's a big question.
3656000	3660000	Is the Darwinian dynamics of life completely unrelated
3660000	3662000	to the things we understand?
3662000	3666000	Or in fact should we recognize that Darwinian dynamics
3666000	3669000	come into existence when individuals come into existence
3669000	3672000	and that there is a dynamic before that
3672000	3674000	that continues all the way back
3674000	3676000	and becomes part of the physics?
3676000	3678000	So in fact what I want to say is
3678000	3680000	you start with the geochemistry.
3680000	3682000	You have an ordered geochemistry
3682000	3684000	which is the seeds of biochemistry
3684000	3686000	but there are not individuals yet.
3686000	3688000	From biochemistry you get cells
3688000	3690000	because they're the best way
3690000	3692000	to make biochemistry happen
3692000	3694000	and you get the chemistry of ecosystems
3694000	3696000	but still there are no stable individuals.
3696000	3698000	Later, later, later
3698000	3700000	when it becomes possible to specialize
3700000	3702000	it starts to become worthwhile
3702000	3704000	to have an individuality that persists.
3704000	3707000	And then the dynamics that we've all heard of from Darwin
3707000	3709000	starts to become important
3709000	3712000	and that's also where accident starts to become important
3712000	3714000	and where family trees begin to show up.
3714000	3717000	So there's a lovely continuity that goes back
3717000	3719000	but to me it's wonderful.
3719000	3721000	We don't have to take the self for granted anymore.
3721000	3724000	It can be a concept that it is the responsibility of science to derive.
3724000	3726000	So let's have
3726000	3728000	there's one right in front here.
3728000	3730000	It's a final question.
3730000	3732000	Well I know there are a lot of experiments
3732000	3734000	that have been done with computer simulations
3734000	3736000	of evolution.
3736000	3738000	So this must be very exciting
3738000	3740000	to me.
3740000	3742000	We'd like to create a toy model
3742000	3744000	and run it through a computer network
3744000	3746000	to see whether a simplified version
3746000	3748000	of 11 simple chemicals
3748000	3750000	that are descending energy
3750000	3752000	train what's involved in this
3752000	3754000	something.
3754000	3756000	The devil here is in the details.
3756000	3758000	Right.
3758000	3760000	So this is a place where there's been too much of a gap
3760000	3762000	and this time I'll throw mud at the physicists.
3762000	3764000	The physicists have stayed with problems
3764000	3766000	that in some sense are simpler
3766000	3768000	than chemistry
3768000	3770000	because the physicists want to say
3770000	3772000	assume a carbon atom is a sphere.
3772000	3774000	Assume a nitrogen atom is also a sphere of the same kind.
3774000	3776000	A nitrogen atom is not the same as a carbon atom.
3776000	3778000	What we need to do
3778000	3780000	at the institute and more broadly
3780000	3782000	is to drag physics forward
3782000	3784000	and say okay
3784000	3786000	what do all of these ideas
3786000	3788000	of dynamics look like
3788000	3790000	when you have the structure of chemistry
3790000	3792000	where carbon really is different from nitrogen
3792000	3794000	and the differences matter.
3794000	3796000	But that is exactly the kind of experiment
3796000	3798000	that we and colleagues are trying to do
3798000	3800000	one little baby step at a time.
3800000	3802000	Right. Thanks Eric.
3802000	3804000	Okay.
3810000	3812000	Thank you.
