267720	268520	Okay.
268520	271260	Vijay Baosubamaniaan.
271260	273960	Wow.
273960	275320	Okay.
275320	276120	How do I begin?
276120	279280	Let me start talking about his research interests.
279280	283560	And I'll be presenting a lot of quotes directly from him
283560	286520	to try to get the nuances correct,
286520	288360	even though I'm familiar with a lot of his work,
288360	290760	I'll collaborate with him and so on.
290760	293080	In Vijay's own words, quote,
293160	296080	he is interested in how natural systems manipulate
296080	298480	and process information.
298480	300720	Okay, well, at that level, you know, big deal.
300720	302880	Everybody here is interested in how systems
302880	304720	process information, right?
305720	309720	Well, God is in the details of what one's interests are
309720	314560	and with Vijay, those details are pretty damned impressive.
314560	317200	For example, in the way that Vijay
317200	319280	construes those particular words,
319280	323240	one of the ways that natural systems process information
323240	325080	is, well, you know,
325080	328040	the fundamental nature of space and time.
328040	331080	So for example, he has done pioneering work
331080	334480	in what is known in quantum cosmology
334480	336580	as the information paradox.
336580	339800	That's the fact that naively at least,
339800	343880	information seems to get lost into a black hole
343880	347320	even though the laws of physics forbid there being any loss
347320	349520	of information in the universe.
350480	353560	Following this theme, he's investigated,
353560	355520	again, quoting from him directly,
355520	358520	how the familiar smooth structure of space-time,
358520	360160	you know, that's what we're familiar with,
360160	363080	how it can emerge for more complex underlying
363080	364480	physical constructs.
365440	367400	So, you know, these are the kinds of things
367400	371360	that you and I might mull over while I'm taking a bath
371360	374400	or on the way to work this morning.
374400	377040	Let's see, I'll have to walk the dog when I get home
377040	380000	and buy a cup of milk and, oh yeah,
380000	382240	just what is going on at the Planck scale
382240	384280	at the event horizon of a spinning black hole
384280	386080	that's got a little bit of charge.
386080	387440	The kind of thing that everybody does
387440	389120	on the way to work in the morning.
390480	392920	Anyway, no surprise though,
392920	395640	the mind of someone like Vijay cannot be contained
395640	400280	in just the fundamental nature of the physical universe.
400280	402720	He actually takes a step back from that and asks,
402720	406840	well, how is it that we might actually come to our understanding
406840	410080	of the physical nature of the universe?
410080	414360	He's been interested in how it is that the human enterprise
414360	419360	of science comes to try to understand scientific reality.
420120	422560	Again, using his own words,
422560	425720	he has also worked on problems in statistical inference
425720	428360	and in particular, Occam's razor,
428360	431040	which is very interesting because all scientific theories
431040	434000	involve fitting of models to data,
434000	437600	trading it off versus the complexity of that model.
437600	439760	Again, just the kind of thing,
439760	441880	maybe this is for the shower rather than the bath
441880	443000	when you go into work.
444560	447680	In short, Vijay is somebody cast in the same mold
447680	449520	as the Santa Fe Institute is in general,
449520	452040	a person of very many interests.
452040	454840	Now to wax a little bit more prosaic though,
454840	457240	one difference between the SFI and Vijay
457240	461440	was that Vijay was born a little bit earlier than the SFI was.
461440	466640	Specifically, he was born in Mumbai, India, Bombay back then,
466640	468600	moved among many cities in India.
468600	471040	His family eventually moved to Jakarta.
471040	474400	Then he came to MIT in the US.
474400	478040	His degrees at first were physics and computer science.
478040	480800	Then he got a PhD at Princeton.
480800	484480	After that, among other awards, well, just achievements,
484480	485880	he was accepted as a junior fellow
485880	488080	with the Harvard Society.
488080	491720	Around this time, he first formed a connection with the SFI.
491720	495640	Since 2000, he has been a professor at University of Pennsylvania.
495640	498200	He's a fellow of the American Physical Society,
498200	501800	has received many awards, over 17,000 citations
501800	503840	in the academic literature.
503840	506640	So that's a little bit of the more prosaic kinds of,
506640	510680	well, he did this and he did this and he did that kind of details.
510680	514920	Anyway, now though, the third one of his major interests,
514920	517160	what he'll be talking about tonight,
517200	521280	this is one way to phrase it, it's how your brain,
521280	524360	the three pounds or so of pink mushy jelly
524360	526480	enscarced in your cranium,
526480	528040	that you know, it kind of wiggles around
528040	529600	when you do this too fast,
529600	533040	how it is that that, the information processing,
533040	535160	remember that's his underlying theme here,
535160	537440	how it is that the information processing
537440	543720	that goes on in that jelly becomes you, okay?
543720	545600	And I have personally been very fortunate
545600	547400	to have some interactions,
547400	549040	we've had many discussions,
549040	551640	Vijay and I on a topic related to that,
551640	555760	namely the energetic cost of the information processing in the brain.
555760	558960	Anyway, tonight you're really in for a singular treat
558960	561480	and with that, over to you, Vijay.
561480	571320	APPLAUSE
571320	572640	Well, David, thank you very much.
572640	574320	Oh, first of all, can you hear me?
574400	575600	Yeah, okay.
575600	577360	Thank you very much for that lovely introduction
577360	581040	that was really kind and it's a delight to be back in Santa Fe.
581040	583360	This is one of my favourite cities on earth.
584600	586440	I've always really liked coming here
586440	588960	and thank you very much for inviting me back
588960	591640	and thanks so much for coming to my talk today.
592640	597840	So great, so let me first of all check that my iPad works, it works.
597840	600480	Great, so the subject of today's talk
600560	605200	is how the brain makes you.
605200	609320	So we should start by first discussing what I mean by making you.
609320	611680	So you're an animal, like any other animal.
611680	614560	So the first thing we've got to ask is what do animals do?
614560	617120	And you know, here are a number of animals
617120	619040	from the OSA, Peninsula and Costa Rica,
619040	621600	these are photographs taken by my son,
621600	624080	who is also one of the animals there.
624080	627200	And what do animals do?
627280	629800	So the main business of being an animal
629800	634800	involves eating, navigating, exploring the world,
634800	638840	sometimes resting like this one here, manipulating the environment,
638840	643200	look at the nest and this web here,
643200	646880	interacting with each other, reproducing, things of this kind.
646880	650640	And that's what animals do almost all of the time.
650640	653520	To do so, they have to do certain things, right?
653520	655520	They have to be able to sense the world,
655520	658560	namely get information from the things around them,
658560	662160	the things, the other animals, the sky, whatever.
662160	665680	They need to process this information that's coming to them
665680	667680	and remember some parts of it,
667680	671120	those parts of it that help them predict what's going to happen in the future.
671120	673880	And after doing this, they need to eventually make decisions,
673880	676160	both in the short term and the long term,
676160	679800	and be able to plan out sequences of actions for the future.
679800	684840	So these are all things that an animal has to do just to be an animal.
684840	687720	Now, some animals do additional things.
687720	688720	They write poetry.
688720	694160	Here's one of my favorite poems by the poet Gerard Manly Hopkins.
694160	695160	They paint.
695160	698760	This is a painting done by my daughter, Aruna.
698760	700160	They write music.
700160	704480	This is by Heinrich Injatz Franz von Bieber.
704480	706600	I'm sure I pronounced that incorrectly.
706600	708520	He was before the Baroque.
708520	712560	And you know, some people write equations like a guy named Einstein
712640	714960	and a guy named Schrödinger wrote this equation.
714960	717840	So we theorize about the universe in this way.
717840	723000	Not all of this, we being human, seems very impressive to us.
723000	725240	And we're very interested in this.
725240	727320	I'm very interested in this. You're all very interested in this.
727320	733040	But in fact, the brain devotes very few resources to such activities.
733040	737360	It's important to us, but really, mostly, that's not what the brain does.
737360	741160	Mostly you, as an animal, like other animals,
741160	744400	mostly you eat, navigate, explore, rest, manipulate the environment,
744400	746760	interact socially with each other and reproduce.
746760	747760	That's what you do.
747760	751880	And then there's these additional things that we do on top of it.
751880	754680	So I'm going to focus most of the talk today
754680	757680	on these sorts of activities that all animals do.
757680	759400	And then we'll talk a little bit at the end
759400	765080	about these sorts of activities that interest us particularly as humans.
765080	768440	Now, to do all of this, what do we use?
768440	771160	The organ we use is the brain.
771160	775760	And I'm going to think about the brain today as a sort of computing engine
775760	777960	that produces the behavior of animals.
777960	780960	So here's the human brain in particular.
780960	781920	And what does it do?
781920	783960	Well, it does the things that I said animals need to do,
783960	786960	which is it gathers information from the world,
786960	789360	it learns from experience, forms memories,
789360	790880	and makes decisions for future actions.
790880	792760	So that's the job of this organ.
792760	795200	You know, the liver processes chemicals for you,
795200	797200	and this organ and the heart pumps blood,
797200	799840	this organ does this stuff with processing information.
799840	802720	It's the kind of computer that you have in your head.
802720	804760	Now, the challenge for this computer
804760	808560	is that it's a very big, complex, and often unpredictable world.
808560	810240	And you know, you have very limited resources.
810240	812080	It's this thing that you carry around inside your head,
812080	814080	it sloshes, it bumps, you know, stuff like this.
814080	815760	That's what you get to use.
815760	818840	And so myself, as a scientist in this area,
818840	822800	the question that animates me is I'm interested in what are the organizational principles
822800	827000	that allow the brain to meet such enormous challenges
827000	828560	that animal life faces.
828560	830240	So that's what I'm interested in.
830240	833360	Now, I'm trained as a physicist,
833360	838560	and a physicist posed to the question about how does this thing, this system, work?
838560	841520	The instinct of most physicists is that, well, you know,
841520	847080	what I'm going to do is I'm going to first work out what stuff this thing is made of.
847080	849000	What are the parts that make it up?
849000	851280	It's kind of an atomic instinct, you know?
851280	853920	Figure out the parts that make up a system.
853920	857560	Then you figure out how all the parts talk to each other, how they interact.
857560	859440	And then the idea is, if you know that well enough,
859440	861520	you can work out what the whole system is doing.
861520	865240	That's the kind of method that physicists get trained in.
865240	867960	And you know, it goes back a long way, hundreds and hundreds of years,
867960	872800	and that's the tendency, that's the approach to the scientific question.
872800	874600	So what's the brain made of?
874600	877480	Well, that brings us to the neuron doctrine.
877480	883040	This is Santiago Ramónica Hall, who lived from 1852 to 1934,
883120	887560	and he is widely considered probably the founding figure of neuroscience.
887560	888800	So what did he do?
888800	892280	He was actually, he first wanted to be an artist, by the way.
892280	897440	But then he wound up becoming an anatomist,
897440	901560	and famously what he did is he founded the neuron doctrine.
901560	905920	The neuron doctrine is the idea that the, if you like, atomic constituents of the brain,
905920	907440	the thing that the brain is really made of,
907440	909760	the stuff that does the interesting things in the brain,
909760	911240	are the neurons of the brain.
911240	913480	So here's a picture of a neuron.
913480	917560	This is a so-called Purkinje cell in the cerebellum that's in the back over here.
917560	921560	This is drawn by Ramónica Hall, and you know, he was a trained artist,
921560	923720	so he drew really beautiful pictures.
923720	929040	So his pictures to this day are wonderful artworks in their own right.
929040	931280	Now he got the Nobel Prize in 1906,
931280	936840	along with another scientist named Camilo Golgi for their work on anatomy.
936840	941240	Golgi did not propound the neuron doctrine.
941240	944160	The reason is they used different experimental methods,
944160	947040	different stains to stain cells,
947040	950240	and the nature of Golgi's stain was he had the impression
950240	952720	that all the neurons were kind of connected together,
952720	953840	and they formed a web work,
953840	956840	and there was sort of one thing that made up the brain,
956840	961680	and it was the very careful anatomy done by Ramónica Hall,
961680	964720	which identified that no, no, no, there are many discreet,
964720	967680	separate objects in the brain called neurons,
967680	971120	and the neurons talk to each other in some form or fashion
971120	976040	in order to produce all the effects that we call animal behavior.
976040	978280	So let's talk about neurons some more.
978280	980560	So you'll see that I'm not a trained artist,
980560	985560	so you'll see my drawings do not compare to this in either precision or beauty,
985560	988800	but let me explain what is a neuron.
988800	993640	A neuron is a cell like any other cell in your body.
993640	996040	So it has a cell body. Let me see, is that big enough?
996040	998760	Can you see that? Can you see the words? OK, great.
998760	1002440	So, well, see the nice thing about iPads is you can increase it. See?
1002440	1006120	Is that nice? OK, so if you can't see it, tell me and I'll just increase it.
1006120	1009920	So a neuron is a cell like any other cell in your body
1009920	1014560	and has a little membrane that contains within it all the molecular machines
1014560	1016280	that make a cell work.
1016280	1021240	But neurons are particular cells that are intended to help your brain compute,
1021240	1025200	and as such, they have very specializations that allow them to do that.
1025200	1030600	So in particular, a computing element like a transistor or a diode or a resistor
1030600	1032880	needs to take in inputs from other stuff.
1032880	1035240	So indeed, if you look at a neuron,
1035240	1039360	it has this set of branches coming out from one end,
1039360	1042040	which is called the dendritic arbor,
1042040	1044960	and on the dendritic arbor, the dendrites,
1044960	1047240	those are the little fibres at the end,
1047240	1051040	and on the dendrites, there are the famous synapses that most people have heard of,
1051040	1055640	the synapses are little junctions where one neuron makes a connection with another neuron.
1055640	1057040	That's a chemical connection.
1057040	1060680	One neuron would dump something called a neurotransmitter,
1060680	1065560	and then sort of diffuses over to the other neuron, is eaten, taken up by the synapse,
1065560	1069400	and then that leads to communication that we'll talk about later.
1069400	1074000	Now the output, if you're a little computing device, you need to have an output,
1074000	1078120	and the output of the neuron goes through a wire called the axon,
1078120	1080920	and the axon then makes an axonal arbor,
1080920	1085400	which also has some synapses at the tip that's where the neuron communicates the next neuron,
1085400	1087640	whatever message it's going to send.
1087640	1091400	So your brain, the human brain contains about 100 billion neurons,
1091400	1096680	and it contains about 100 to 1,000 trillion synapses.
1096680	1098720	So there's not just one kind of neuron.
1098720	1101280	You know, if you go look inside a computer, a silicon computer,
1101280	1103480	there are a few kinds of circuit elements, right?
1103480	1108040	There are transistors, there are diodes, there are capacitors,
1108040	1113760	there are resistors, there's a repertoire that engineers use
1113760	1116640	to build up computers in general.
1116640	1122200	So in fact, in the brain, there are very many types of neurons.
1122200	1125960	And Cahal identified them by how they looked.
1125960	1130680	And for example, here is what's called a cortical pyramidal cell,
1130680	1132960	because it looks a little bit like a pyramid,
1132960	1136120	and these pyramidal cells are the workhorses of your brain.
1136120	1139160	All over the cortex, you find them layered upon layer
1139160	1141600	of cortical pyramidal cells.
1141600	1145040	This is this cerebellar purkinje cell that we mentioned.
1145040	1149200	Here's this huge thing, it has this huge dendritic arbor,
1149200	1153360	which it uses like a giant fan to catch inputs
1153360	1155880	that are passing perpendicular to it.
1155880	1158600	It does that as part of controlling your body
1158600	1163320	and allowing you to move your body in ways that you want.
1163320	1167080	And then in addition, here's another cell called a cortical stellate cell.
1167080	1171720	So in fact, as we will see, there is a great diversity of forms of neurons.
1171720	1175680	And usually, in biology, there's a rule, a working rule,
1175680	1178120	which says that form follows function.
1178120	1181520	So what's going to happen is that they look different like this versus this.
1181520	1182680	They're going to do different things.
1182680	1184680	They'll have different biochemistry,
1184680	1187760	they'll perform different functions within this computer.
1187760	1190960	So it's like you've got many circuit elements that are stuck together
1190960	1195000	to produce your behavior.
1195000	1199760	Now, the key thing for us is that neurons literally,
1199760	1203840	like the components of a computer, are electrical circuit devices.
1203840	1205680	They're electrical devices.
1205680	1207080	So how does this work?
1207080	1210560	So once again, here's a picture of a neuron.
1210560	1215760	And if you go measure its voltage, literally, I mean its voltage, right,
1215760	1219360	you'll find that its voltage inside a brain,
1219360	1223240	the voltage will be something like minus 70 millivolts, typical neurons.
1223240	1226640	They're like at rest, they're like at minus 70 millivolts.
1226640	1231520	Then, if you have input coming into it, and the input could be signals,
1231520	1236280	neurotransmitters, which I mentioned earlier, sent out by the previous neuron.
1236280	1241000	Or if this is a neuron in the eye, it might be light landing on it
1241000	1243840	because there's a little sensor that senses like.
1243840	1247480	Or if it's in the nose, if it's an olfactory receptor neuron,
1247480	1251320	it's a little molecule floating in the air which binds to a receptor
1251320	1253640	and that produces a signal, you know, whichever you do.
1253640	1256640	If a signal comes in, here's what happens.
1256640	1260720	The voltage of the neuron begins to increase.
1260720	1264360	And when it reaches some critical value, there's a sort of runaway feedback process.
1264360	1269280	It's a little bit like feeding the output of your speaker back into the microphone.
1269280	1270560	And so it goes round and round.
1270560	1275280	It goes boom and sort of explodes rapidly to some very high potential.
1275280	1280360	And then there's another feedback process, a negative feedback process, as they call it,
1280360	1284680	which causes this to dip back down and flip back to rest.
1284680	1291400	So if you step away and time a little bit, you'll find that it goes like this and then boom!
1291400	1294160	There's a very sharp pulse of electricity.
1294160	1300240	So if you sort of look above this level, it's like this silence and then boom!
1300240	1301840	Silence, boom!
1301840	1304240	So it's essentially a digital signal.
1304240	1308400	It's like looking at a digital computer where you have this device going every once in a while,
1308400	1315680	sending out ones, hold up these spikes or action potentials, or zeros, where it's silent.
1315680	1317320	So it's very much like a digital computer.
1317320	1319080	That's what you have in your head.
1319080	1326280	So just to drive home that this is absolutely a mechanical, physical process,
1326280	1329800	beautifully studied in biophysics, we can even delve in.
1329800	1334080	You know, the instinct of many scientists is you see a phenomenon like this.
1334080	1336600	You say, well, well, how does that exactly happen?
1336600	1339880	You know, and you can work that out in complete detail.
1339880	1345520	So for example, if you look at a membrane surrounding the cell, that's the membrane right there,
1345520	1351520	you'll find embedded in this membrane various molecular machines,
1351520	1358720	such as ion channels, which allow specific ions like sodium and potassium mentioned here,
1358720	1361160	or chloride or calcium.
1361160	1364800	They let certain ions pass back and forth.
1364800	1371280	And then you have these things called pumps, which have the job of when the ions go back and forth,
1371280	1375320	changing in this way the voltage of the neuron.
1375320	1377160	Something has to be done to restore it, right?
1377160	1381600	You send a lot of current back and forth, and the voltage changes, you've got to restore everything.
1381600	1384240	And these pumps basically burn energy.
1384240	1392360	They burn the gasoline of the cell, which is a molecule called adenazine triphosphate, ATP,
1392360	1397280	and it burns ATP and goes chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk for a while,
1397280	1403160	and then sort of restores the levels of ions inside and outside.
1403160	1407960	So at rest there's a certain proportion of sodium and potassium inside,
1407960	1411360	and a certain proportion of sodium and potassium outside,
1411360	1414400	and then you have the kinds of processes physicists talk about.
1414400	1419040	Stuff, you know, it's like if you have more salt outside a membrane than inside,
1419040	1420840	you know how the salt comes in, right?
1420840	1425680	In the same way, if there's more potassium sodium outside than inside,
1425680	1429440	the sodium wants to come in, and the potassium, because there's more inside than outside,
1429440	1431680	wants to go out so that these processes like this,
1431680	1433760	basically stuff you can understand perfectly well,
1433760	1435640	and then these pumps are working against it,
1435640	1438280	and then what happens is that you have external inputs,
1438280	1442240	but change how open or closed these channels are
1442240	1446120	to allow the ions to pass before through them, and that's it.
1446120	1449440	It's a completely, I mean, just like a mechanical device,
1449440	1453280	with stuff flowing back and forth, and you can work this out in detail
1453280	1457440	and show that if you have a system like this, it'll produce these voltage spikes,
1457440	1461680	and then if you make a voltage spike over there, it'll then propagate down the axon.
1461680	1465080	It's literally making, you give it the correct inputs,
1465160	1468960	it's going to make a digital pulse, and the pulse is going to move down.
1468960	1474160	In fact, this is so well understood that a Nobel Prize went to it.
1474160	1478280	So Hodgkin and Huxley, in 1963, worked all of this out,
1478280	1481280	and here's a set of equations describing their model of the salt.
1481280	1483000	You don't have to read the equations.
1483000	1486480	I just want to show you, you can write it on a damn page, right?
1486480	1489720	This means you can put it on a computer, and you can certainly simulate it.
1489720	1494840	You can totally describe how a single cell describes it in complete and utter detail.
1494840	1496960	It's actually a little bit more complicated than this,
1496960	1501560	because for the purposes of this talk, I'm talking about sodium and potassium and things like that,
1501560	1506000	but there's more things, this chloride and there's calcium,
1506000	1511160	and actually there's more than one kind of ion channel for potassium, some details, details.
1511160	1513840	But basically, you know exactly how to do this,
1513840	1516040	so in principle, you could just build yourself a brain.
1516040	1521320	If you knew enough about all the other neurons and all the types of neurons and all these problems,
1521320	1523520	you could just build yourself a brain on a computer.
1523520	1530280	That's the promise of this kind of result that won this Nobel Prize, right?
1530280	1532280	But what's the problem, right?
1532280	1536440	The problem is, oh wait, actually before I tell you the problem,
1536440	1538720	let me just sort of say a word about this.
1538720	1542560	So this idea that the brain really just functions in electricity,
1542560	1547600	just an electrical device, a computer of some kind, goes back a long, long way.
1547600	1553240	And the discovery that somehow there's an electrical basis to animal behaviour
1553240	1557880	goes back all the way, I don't know why I said this is a 19th century idea,
1557880	1561400	it's even an 18th century idea, it goes back all the way to the 18th century,
1561400	1566920	with the discovery by Luigi and Luisa Galvani, we're in Bologna,
1566920	1571760	that you can make frogs' legs, for example, twitch, by putting electricity into them.
1571760	1577640	So at the time, Luigi got most of the credit because Luisa being a woman,
1577640	1582000	couldn't be a professor in the university and couldn't also take credit for the discoveries,
1582000	1587000	but well, you know, times have improved a bit, they're perhaps not completely.
1587000	1591960	Anyway, so they were the ones who discovered this notion of animal electricity.
1591960	1595080	Then immediately after that, this is the time when Benjamin Franklin,
1595080	1598560	you know, is discovering positive and negative charges, flying his kite,
1598560	1601440	all this kind of stuff, that's all happening at the same time.
1601440	1605080	And then Volta, also in Italy, invented the battery,
1605080	1609160	which then allowed controlled injection of currents into living tissues,
1609160	1611400	and then you could see how they moved and people had this idea
1611400	1615600	that somehow electricity itself was the vital spark of life.
1615600	1619480	It's not that it made neurons work, because they didn't know about neurons really,
1619480	1620680	but they thought it was life itself.
1620680	1624600	So for example, so they thought, well, maybe we can reanimate the dead.
1624600	1630240	So Aldini reanimated a criminal who was executed using electricity,
1630240	1633680	and then it was done again in 1818 with another criminal,
1633680	1637720	and in those days there were laws that allowed you to experiment
1637800	1642720	with the dead bodies of, you know, of murderers and things like that.
1642720	1646680	Anyhow, this led, for example, Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein,
1646680	1652640	because it led to the idea that life and living things and animals could be just built,
1652640	1655680	that they're sort of machines that could be built,
1655680	1657720	and that's what's partly animating us still,
1657720	1662280	this notion of artificial life and artificial intelligence goes back,
1662280	1667200	excuse me, goes back to these discoveries, you know, hundreds of years ago.
1667200	1671400	So now, of course, we know that electricity, the shocking dead body,
1671400	1673520	doesn't make it alive again.
1673520	1676320	What it really does is following what I told you a moment ago,
1676320	1679880	it causes the nerve cells to fire,
1679880	1683000	and when they fire, they cause muscles to move,
1683000	1688320	and then the body will move in the way it looks as though you reanimated the dead,
1688320	1689920	but you haven't really.
1689920	1694000	Anyway, so suppose we know how a single neuron works in all of its detail,
1694000	1696920	then what's the problem with understanding the rest of animal behavior,
1696920	1698240	just putting enough neurons together?
1698240	1705240	Well, the problem is, you know, a single neuron can't produce a poetry,
1705240	1708440	a single neuron doesn't feel love, you know, things like this, right?
1708440	1712880	Really, neurons produce the brain through the circuits that they work in.
1712880	1719080	It's really the interaction, the collective of all the neurons that makes the brain.
1719080	1721040	So what do these circuits look like?
1721040	1726640	So perhaps the best-studied circuit in the entire brain of any animal
1726640	1728360	is the retina.
1728360	1736120	So this is a drawing done, again, by Ramoni Kahal, back in 1917,
1736120	1740160	and what it's drawing is a picture of the retina like this.
1740160	1744880	Over here, these are the famous photoreceptors that many of you will have heard of.
1744880	1750200	Photoreceptors are neurons which take in light and convert the light
1750200	1752960	into an electrical signal that comes out the other end.
1752960	1756480	So that's the first layer of the retina.
1756480	1760840	Now, the second layer of the retina consists of cells called bipolar cells.
1760840	1764560	These are like analogue computing devices, namely they're not digital.
1764560	1766640	They have voltage levels that go up and down,
1766640	1769000	and they're all continuous, it isn't 1s and 0s if you like,
1769000	1773880	but they do all kinds of calculations and computations which are studied.
1773880	1778000	Then these things form the second layer, feed into a third layer,
1778000	1781760	and the third layer are cells called ganglion cells,
1781760	1786440	and these ganglion cells are the output cells of the retina, right?
1786440	1789880	And these output cells, you know, the axons come out,
1789880	1795000	and the bundle of axons is a thing you call your optic nerve, right?
1795000	1800280	So very often people have a tendency to think about the retina like a camera.
1800280	1803400	It just takes the pixels and writes down the amount of light in each location.
1803400	1804840	But nothing could be further from the truth.
1804840	1809080	This is your primordial example of what would be called a three-layer neural network.
1809080	1812800	It's a piece of your central brain that got put on a stalk
1812800	1816400	and then sent out to the front of your head during development,
1816400	1817880	during embryonic development,
1817880	1820800	so that you could see in the direction in which you're going.
1820800	1822800	It's really a piece of your central brain.
1822800	1826800	And indeed, in keeping with that, central brain is a very complicated place.
1826800	1829400	This picture drawn by Cajal is actually a cartoon.
1829400	1833080	We now know that there are more than 60 kinds of cells,
1833080	1835000	different types of cells,
1835000	1839560	just so different computational elements in the retina alone.
1839560	1842480	So, for example, if these are the photoreceptors,
1842480	1845760	and then these are the bipolar cells described in the second layer,
1845760	1848920	and then these are the ganglion cells described in the third layer,
1848920	1855760	in fact, in between, there is an entire zoo of other so-called interneurons
1855760	1858400	that sort of communicate laterally.
1858400	1861600	And what they do is the following.
1861600	1865360	What they do is, you know, most of the light coming to your eyes
1865360	1867640	is not actually useful to your behaviour.
1867640	1868880	There's only certain things that are useful.
1868880	1871560	And indeed, the ganglion cells, what they do is,
1871560	1873200	they report the things that are useful.
1873200	1875680	Like, there are ganglion cells called on cells
1875680	1880400	that respond and tell you when there's a bright spot in the world at some location.
1880400	1882880	There are off cells that tell you about dark spots.
1882880	1886600	There are so-called local edge detectors that detect local edges.
1886600	1888520	There are direction-selective cells
1888520	1893000	that will respond when a little blob moves left to right or right to left or up or down.
1893000	1895520	You know, there are all of these cells, these different kinds.
1895520	1900520	So how do you extract these so-called visual features from the scene?
1900520	1910360	Well, this hugely diverse body of neurons is charged with removing from the visual input
1910360	1913800	everything that's irrelevant and leaving what is relevant.
1913800	1918440	So famously, for example, in analogy, someone once asked Michelangelo,
1918440	1919880	how did you sculpt these sculptures?
1919880	1921160	David.
1921160	1923920	And he said, well, actually, David was already in the marble.
1923920	1926280	I just took out everything else.
1926280	1927760	And so that's what these things are doing.
1927760	1932600	They're taking out everything else and leaving the important stuff to go through to the brain.
1932600	1933600	So this is how it's organized.
1933600	1937920	So you can see it's a large collective effort of many, many types of neurons
1937920	1940160	arranged in a very specific circuit.
1940160	1944800	For example, you will always find that the slow bipolar cell here connects to the local edge cell
1944800	1948120	and the fast bipolar cell here connects to the brisk transient cell.
1948120	1950800	So it's like a circuit that Intel would design.
1950800	1952200	You know, the engineers designed something.
1952200	1953240	This isn't designed.
1953240	1955160	It's selected out by evolution.
1955160	1956400	But anyway, there you go.
1956400	1961120	It's like a circuit that you will find in every vertebrate eye.
1961120	1969880	Now, even that is not actually a sufficient picture of the degree of cooperativity in the brain
1969880	1971640	that produces all of the behavior.
1971640	1976640	So if you pop out from the scale of neurons and instead look at the whole brain,
1976640	1979720	here is your brain, you know, looking this away.
1979720	1985840	And in the back of your head, there are circuits that are associated with vision.
1985880	1991080	Over here, there's a strip going down the side of your head that helps you control your body.
1991080	1998520	Over here, there's an area called Broca's area, which is associated with the production of speech
1998520	2002160	and, you know, many other areas of this kind, right, the hearing, et cetera.
2002160	2007440	And in the front here, there's regions of your brain that are associated with planning
2007440	2011840	and personality and things of this kind, right?
2011840	2016640	So this is why, by the way, you know, decades and decades ago,
2016640	2023640	there was a treatment for schizophrenia, which involved basically sticking an ice pick up your nose
2023640	2029400	and scrambling this area because there was some issue with it.
2029400	2031880	And the result is, you know, the person won't be schizophrenic,
2031880	2035600	but they won't be themselves anymore because you scramble the circuits that make you.
2035600	2042160	It really should be very careful with any kind of treatment that involves sort of messing with bits of the brain.
2042160	2047240	OK, so anyway, so there are all of these things, and we know that function is localised in this way,
2047240	2049680	that this is called localisation of function for many reasons.
2049680	2054080	So one reason is, you know, for example, if you bash the back of your head, you fall backward,
2054080	2056800	you know how in the cartoons you see stars, right?
2056800	2060760	You know, Bugs Bunny sees stars when he bashes the back of his head.
2060760	2065520	It's because Bugs Bunny has bruise on this part of the brain.
2065520	2068600	So the circuits aren't working quite right, that's what's going on.
2068600	2073200	So when someone has a stroke, sometimes you'll see one side of the face sag,
2073200	2074960	but everything else is completely fine.
2074960	2078440	That's because there is an issue, there's a problem,
2078440	2082160	let's say in this region of the brain, this is the motor cortex,
2082160	2085640	and within the motor cortex there are circuits here that control the knee
2085640	2087760	and circuits here that control the face.
2087760	2091080	So if you have a stroke there, this thing sags, but the rest is fine.
2091080	2094280	But it's all collective, right? There's a collective circuit,
2094280	2097400	which of course has little areas that concentrate on different things,
2097400	2099400	but it's a collective effect.
2099400	2101760	And this is not just on the surface of the brain, by the way.
2101760	2106440	So deep in the middle of the brain, there's an area there called a hippocampal formation,
2106440	2109320	which is associated with, for example, memory, right?
2109320	2114160	So if you have damage there, you will not be able to form long-term memories, right?
2114160	2116560	And it's also associated with spatial cognition,
2116560	2120080	with spatial, you know, animals need to map space
2120080	2122240	and be able to make plans and navigate.
2122320	2125080	And so all of those circuits are hidden here.
2125080	2125960	Okay.
2125960	2130240	So actually, human beings have known about this kind of thing,
2130240	2135160	that there's function localized different parts of the brain for a very long time.
2135160	2138240	This is a picture of what's now called a Smith papyrus after Smith,
2138240	2142400	who bought the papyrus in the late 1800s.
2142400	2146240	This was a papyrus written in 3000 BC.
2146240	2151840	And the author of this papyrus describes various kinds of traumatic brain injuries,
2151840	2156640	and then explains that, you know, something will stop working, but everything else works.
2156640	2162240	So this author knew that function was localized in the various parts of the brain.
2162240	2167400	The modern version of this idea is due to Paul Broca, a French doctor,
2167400	2173320	who basically discovered Broca's area because he had patients who had impairments in their speech,
2173320	2179880	and he discovered they had lesions in this area of his brain, of their brains,
2179880	2182040	and there's another area called Wernicke's area,
2182040	2185960	which is associated, but later discovered, having to do with speech understanding.
2185960	2190000	So if you go to Paris, you can go to the 13th arrondissement,
2190000	2194960	and, you know, admire Rue Broca, a name for him for all of his great discoveries.
2194960	2200000	There you go. There's the picture of the street sign of Rue Broca.
2200000	2205600	All you need to do to get a street sign is discover localization of function in your brain.
2205600	2209880	OK. Very good.
2209880	2217920	So now that's also not enough in describing how complicated this processing machine is.
2217920	2224080	You know, you all know, if you ever looked at a wiring diagram of something like a chip that powers your computer,
2224080	2226800	you know, it's got lots and lots of pieces with intricate circuits,
2226800	2228600	and all those pieces connect to every other piece.
2228600	2232480	Otherwise, of course, they couldn't produce their collective effects.
2232480	2235600	And indeed, all of these brain areas connect.
2235600	2242240	So today, in the 21st century, there are all of these extraordinarily beautiful techniques now
2242240	2244160	for tracing out the wires.
2244160	2246720	It used to be that people like Cajal, you know,
2246720	2250280	they had to take the brain of an animal, slowly slice it up,
2250280	2254520	very, very carefully trace everything, draw it out by hand.
2254520	2260960	You know, you can imagine the level of dedication and sheer labor it took.
2260960	2264320	Now, we have all these amazing techniques.
2264320	2269600	You can do things like you can make neurons glow in different colors
2269600	2273640	and get the color to propagate along the axon, you know, the output of the wire,
2273640	2276120	so you can see where it's pointing to.
2276120	2278480	You can inject viruses into bits of brain.
2278480	2283600	The virus will go backward along where, you know, the neuron connects to.
2283600	2286360	And then you can find out which neuron, one neuron down.
2286360	2288800	You can tag it in that way, and then it will stop working.
2288800	2290400	The virus stops working at the point.
2290400	2292040	You can engineer all these things.
2292040	2297160	So, in this way, we now have far more detailed maps of the brain.
2297160	2300080	Here's a picture from a paper by these authors.
2300080	2305960	It was a review paper showing some of the nerve tracts, as they're called,
2305960	2308200	the wires that pass between.
2308200	2311920	And now, because of that, we just have a much more refined understanding
2311920	2316840	of how collectively all these bits of brain produce functions that we care about.
2316840	2320400	So, for example, following what I said a moment ago,
2320400	2323960	in Broca's era, or shortly thereafter, we might have said,
2323960	2326520	well, you know, here's Broca's area,
2326520	2330480	which, you know, somehow is responsible for articulation, production of speech.
2330480	2335200	Here's Borneke's area that is somehow associated with comprehension of speech.
2335200	2336960	Let me explain the difference between those two.
2336960	2339880	If you damage Borneke's area, you'll produce speech.
2339880	2342080	It just won't make any sense.
2342080	2346760	And if you damage Broca's area, you can understand speech perfectly well.
2346760	2350600	People can talk to you, but you won't be able to make it.
2350600	2356120	You can't control your muscles to make the speech, stuff like this.
2356120	2358440	There's also another area, Gershwin's area for concepts.
2358440	2360080	You damage that, you have problems with concepts.
2360080	2363280	Anyway, so there are these areas that people identified.
2363280	2370440	So a more refined model you might derive by looking at the way the nerve tracts go
2370440	2373160	is that there's clearly a pathway from here to here,
2373160	2375800	so from the comprehension area to the production area,
2375800	2378840	and there's a secondary path, you know, there are two pathways like that.
2378840	2381000	But now we have even more fancy techniques.
2381000	2384280	You can put a person in an fMRI machine, right?
2384280	2389480	Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machine, and have them do stuff.
2389480	2393480	And while they're doing stuff, you can record, you can find a way
2393480	2396800	of measuring which areas of the brain are active.
2396800	2401080	So which areas of the brain are active together when you do different things.
2401080	2404400	And now you get a much more refined picture that all of these areas are there.
2404400	2408760	It's true that they're associated with articulation concepts and comprehension,
2408760	2414040	but depending upon exactly what you're trying to do, they connect in different ways.
2414040	2417600	So there's a sort of flexible computational engine
2417600	2423840	wherein, you know, the different bits of it work together for one task or not,
2423840	2426160	depending upon what's necessary to do the task.
2426160	2431440	Is this amazingly flexible engine inside your head for producing all of animal behaviour?
2431440	2435280	So that's the task to work out how all of these parts connect
2435280	2440000	and how they reconnect and reorganise themselves when they need to do things.
2440000	2441160	OK.
2441160	2445400	So myself, my interest is to understand how all of that happens.
2445400	2447120	I think of the brain as a computing device.
2447120	2450440	I want to know how this computer works.
2450440	2453360	So there are many ways of approaching this,
2453360	2457320	but one way of doing that is, well, so the way I do that,
2457400	2463240	is I take a view of the circuit repertoire of the architecture of this computer
2463240	2469360	as a kind of memory of the computations that have predictive value for your behaviour,
2469360	2471840	because, you know, animal life is about predicting what's going to happen
2471840	2473640	and taking action appropriately,
2473640	2480280	and that these computations have been learned over evolutionary time
2480280	2485240	and then encoded in your genome and in the developmental programme.
2485240	2486560	So that's the way I tend to think of it.
2486560	2489640	These are computations that are useful to you,
2489640	2493120	and then what you do is something, and then you use them.
2493120	2498040	So the question that animates my work is what are the organisational principles or laws, if you like,
2498040	2505280	that control the collective computation and information processing of the brain.
2505280	2506640	So, OK.
2506640	2511760	And, you know, if you're interested, there's a popular book by Peter Sterling and Simon Loughlin,
2511760	2514680	this book, your principles of neural design, that you'll probably enjoy,
2514680	2518640	which lays out many possible principles that may be operative
2518640	2523480	in the organisation of the circuits in the brain.
2523480	2526000	Now, so what principles might be relevant?
2526000	2527960	What kinds of laws or principles?
2527960	2530000	So there are several that you could try to name,
2530000	2532400	but for today's purposes I'm going to name two,
2532400	2537840	and then I'm going to illustrate them in the operation of some of these circuits.
2537840	2543960	So, for example, one principle involves the costs of computation.
2543960	2548120	So this is your brain, and this is your laptop,
2548120	2552200	and, you know, your brain is only 2% of your body weight,
2552200	2555920	but it's actually 20% of your metabolic load.
2555920	2560880	What that means is it's 10 times more expensive than muscle.
2560880	2566360	This is a seriously expensive thing to own, right?
2566360	2570800	And, you know, it's also packed solid, right?
2570880	2574440	Every millimeter cubed contains four kilometres of wire.
2574440	2577240	This is like this really dense thing, right?
2577240	2580360	So on the one hand this sounds like, wow, you know, that's a really expensive thing.
2580360	2587480	On the other hand, you know, your brain consumes something like 12 to 20 watts of power.
2587480	2591840	Your laptop consumes 80 watts of power, right?
2591840	2595600	And it sure can multiply fast, but, you know, it can't give the stock.
2595600	2597360	Well, at least not yet.
2597680	2601680	But even things like, by the way, you know, AI seems to have the promise of, you know,
2601680	2603960	getting, making machines that'll do me,
2603960	2608520	but actually they have to train their machines on so much data.
2608520	2611880	You know, planetary, a planet's worth of data,
2611880	2616080	they use a city's worth of power to train these things, right?
2616080	2618440	Whereas I can learn stuff with one example, right?
2618440	2621480	I don't need the city's worth of, you know, the planet's worth of data.
2621480	2624280	So there's a real difference in the way the brain works.
2624280	2627800	It's just much more efficient, right, in the way it operates
2627800	2630040	than your typical silicon machine.
2630040	2632920	That's also one reason why computer scientists are interested in this kind of thing
2632920	2635320	because they'd like to make more efficient machines.
2635320	2640320	So you could ask yourself, how does the brain achieve this sort of efficiency
2640320	2644560	relative to the engineered systems that we have been able to produce so far, right?
2644560	2649920	I've described this baroque architecture with lots and lots of pieces that interact in some way.
2649920	2656640	So one idea that's very powerful and has been used powerfully in neuroscience
2656640	2664000	is that the brain achieves its efficiency by adapting its circuits to the structure of the world
2664000	2668960	and then using learning and self-organisation to further adapt the changes, right?
2668960	2672240	You know, you first adapt to the world and then if the world is not quite what you expected,
2672240	2675880	you change the circuit so that it's well adapted to the world.
2675880	2678880	So why would this make the system more efficient?
2678880	2680920	Well, the idea is roughly like this.
2680920	2686240	So if you talk to sociologists or something, they'll tell you that in the back of the day,
2686240	2691720	we were all hunter-gatherers, we all dug the ground, we hunted the animals, we built the house,
2691720	2694920	you know, whatever, we did everything and society got along.
2694920	2699920	And then as society's progress, the civilisations developed, et cetera,
2699920	2702120	you know, there's a segregation of function.
2702120	2706480	What happens is that the shoemaker makes the shoes, the baker breaks the bread,
2706480	2712760	you know, the mason builds the houses and then each unit in the society develops efficiencies.
2712760	2716760	They do their job really well because they're well trained, they're adapted to it, et cetera, et cetera,
2716760	2720080	and the whole system, by communicating between all the individuals,
2720080	2724840	works better, works smoother, it's more productive, et cetera, and it's more efficient.
2724840	2731000	So you could try to apply a similar idea to the organisation of these circuits in our head
2731000	2732440	which have evolved over time.
2732440	2736960	So that's a very important idea in neuroscience.
2736960	2739800	So that's principle one, the efficient use of resources.
2739800	2746200	So the idea of this principle is that brains exploit the average structure of the world
2746200	2751960	to efficiently allocate their limited resources for the tasks that they have to do
2751960	2755280	to maximise gain for the organism.
2755280	2758800	Now if I were to draw a cartoon of something like that, it might be something like this.
2758880	2763040	Remember how in the retina we said, well, you know, there's all the light coming in,
2763040	2767800	but at the back end of the eye, you have a certain number of different neurons, right?
2767800	2771040	There are 20 types of ganglion cells, we call them,
2771040	2773800	but you know, they're each charged with doing a thing, right?
2773800	2776840	One thing will look for bright spots, that's the on cell.
2776840	2781160	The one thing that's for dark spots is the off cell, you know, and so on and so forth.
2781160	2784880	There's a certain repertoire of things that are apparently needed for vision,
2784880	2789120	so you make those things, and then each of those things is one of these blobs,
2789120	2795240	and together they cover the space of those aspects of the visual world that you need for your behaviour.
2795240	2799120	And they have to allocate those resources in an effective way.
2799120	2802800	And you could keep doing this with a sense of smell, with your sense of place,
2802800	2806200	you know, the whole brain, and you could try thinking in this way.
2806200	2811480	So this is a very important principle that's used often by neuroscientists
2811480	2815520	to try to understand the architecture of circuits in the brain.
2815520	2819560	Another important principle is this one, it's learning and self-organisation.
2819560	2822720	These individuals whom I know well did a lot of that,
2822720	2826160	and so what do they do, so that's far as I can tell,
2826160	2832800	their little heads self-organise a lot of the architecture within it through dynamics and learning,
2832800	2834000	and what do they do?
2834000	2839760	Well, this learning and self-organisation adapts the brain
2839840	2844440	to ongoing variations in the world, you know, their world is different from the world I was growing up in.
2844440	2847160	It allows them to learn new tasks and environments at this age,
2847160	2849320	they definitely didn't know how to ride bikes,
2849320	2853360	and you can correct inaccuracies in pre-existing dynamics.
2853360	2855920	Anybody who's interacted with small children knows perfectly well
2855920	2859600	that, you know, when the baby first tries to reach for stuff, it doesn't quite, you know, it doesn't get there, right?
2859600	2861560	You can't quite do it.
2861560	2866400	And then they learn how to control their muscles to get there, to reach it.
2866400	2868920	Or you watch a kid learning a musical instrument.
2868920	2875160	Well, you know, the first, you know, 500 times doesn't sound so good.
2875160	2881640	And then eventually it does, because there's something that happens where you learn how to operate the bits of you to do the right thing.
2881640	2885960	So that's the learning that has to happen in a variable world.
2885960	2891640	OK, so what I would like to do in the remaining, what, 15, 20 minutes, 20 minutes or so,
2891640	2897680	is that I would like to give you examples of how in the field people use these kinds of ideas
2897680	2900840	to understand the organization of neural circuits.
2900840	2906240	I mean, so far I gave you a description of the architecture, right, of these circuits,
2906240	2911440	from the neuron level, you know, the atomic constituent of the brain, all the way to the whole brain, right?
2911440	2918760	But in science, we want more than that, we want an understanding of why they're organized the way they are.
2918760	2923840	How they produce the dynamics and effects that they do.
2923840	2932080	So there is an enormous amount of interesting work that has happened since the era of Cahal in these directions.
2932080	2936960	So I want to give you a little flavor of some of it by giving you a few examples from my work.
2936960	2940520	I'm going to pick simple examples because, you know, there's 20 minutes left.
2940520	2944240	So we should go, so it has to be simple and precise enough.
2944240	2948520	So I'm going to give you examples in four domains, right?
2948520	2951960	One domain is seeing, vision.
2951960	2956400	The second domain is smelling, or factions. These are both sensory domains.
2956400	2960200	Then I want to talk about learning to sing. This is in songbirds.
2960200	2963760	So that's what the professionals would call motor control,
2963760	2973640	because you need to control all the muscles in the songbirds apparatus in order to produce the sounds.
2973640	2977320	And then I'm going to talk very, very briefly about navigation,
2977320	2982840	which is actually the subject that I spend probably most of my time on, thinking about right now.
2982840	2985400	So I'll just say a little bit about that, and then we'll end.
2985400	2987760	So I'm going to give you four examples of this guy.
2987760	2989440	So let's start with one.
2989440	2995480	So first I'm going to talk about vision, and my goal, by the way, what's my goal with these examples?
2995480	2999560	You remember I talked about these two principles, adaptation to the world and learning,
2999560	3004880	as two mechanisms that are used to, well, to organize neural circuits.
3004880	3007680	You can understand why they're organized the way they are,
3007680	3012880	but think about adaptation to the world, and about learning to reorganize.
3012880	3015320	So I want to give you two examples of adaptation.
3015320	3020720	Those will be the sensory examples, and an example of learning.
3020720	3023040	So first let's talk about vision.
3023040	3024760	So why did I choose vision?
3024760	3029440	Well, we're very visual animals, and it's a sense we use most of,
3029440	3035760	so that naturally neuroscientists gravitate often to thinking about the visual world.
3035760	3038240	So I want to ask a very basic question.
3038240	3039680	Here's the question.
3039680	3045600	So we drew this, Ramoni Kahal drew these pictures with all of these different neurons,
3045600	3049360	and then I showed you another picture, a more modern one, of all the cell types,
3049360	3051080	and there are like 60 types of cells.
3051080	3053120	God help us in this structure.
3053120	3054400	Well, what did I do?
3054400	3056720	Let me just look at the output layer for now.
3056720	3059000	These were the so-called retinal ganglion cells,
3059000	3063360	and I told you that these cells detect features, visual features of the world,
3063360	3066200	bright spots, dark spots, color, local motion, et cetera,
3066200	3070320	and then they put the signal, these digital signals that I talked about,
3070320	3076000	go down the optic nerve and that little bundle of wires that's like an ethernet's cable worth of data,
3076000	3081480	and that data goes to your brain and you do all the stuff that you do with vision.
3081480	3085920	So following a kind of question that immediately comes to mind
3086000	3089120	is you have a certain repertoire of these cells.
3089120	3091400	Well, humans, we have about a million of them.
3091400	3094920	If you're a guinea pig, you have about 100,000 of them.
3094920	3097280	So, you know, it's not an infinite resource.
3097280	3102040	So if you spent all of your money on detecting bright spots, there's nothing left.
3102040	3105840	If you spent all of your cells on detecting bright spots very well,
3105840	3110920	you will have nothing left for detecting motion, for example.
3110920	3116760	So there has to be something interesting in the way this sensory device, right?
3116760	3121160	This is like you have a robot and has little eyes sitting in front looking at stuff, right?
3121160	3123760	So you've got to decide. How are you going to decide the design of that eye?
3123760	3126400	It's only a big. It's got only some of the units in it.
3126400	3130400	How are you going to allocate the different pieces of the circuit?
3130400	3136840	So here, there should be some choice done by evolution for the allocation of these features.
3136840	3140600	So for this talk, let's take the specific example
3140600	3144800	because it's easy to imagine of bright and dark spot detectors.
3144800	3151240	So bright spot means you look for a little bright spot relative to the near-surrounding region.
3151240	3156600	A dark, so that's called an on-cell, and an off-cell does the reverse.
3156600	3161600	It looks for a little dark spot relative to the near-surrounding region.
3161600	3166920	So we're going to ask the question, well, suppose you have a certain number of spot detectors,
3166920	3168920	how many on-and-off cells should you have?
3168920	3171880	How many bright and dark spot detectors should you have?
3171880	3177280	And we're going to try to use this to understand the architecture of the retina.
3177280	3180280	Just incidentally, it's also important therapeutically, right?
3180280	3186480	So if somebody's, you know, when the day comes when we can replace the retina,
3186480	3190640	if somebody's retina degenerates and we want to replace it by a silicon device,
3190640	3194160	it would be better if we could understand how many of these and how many of these detectors
3194160	3197680	we should put in into that silicon device.
3197680	3205960	Right, so if the idea, if this kind of organization involves adaptation to the world around us,
3205960	3208280	a question we have to ask is what is the world around us?
3208280	3212880	So for each sense or for each mode of interaction with the world,
3212880	3217520	if you adapt it to the world, then one question you have to ask is what does the world look like?
3217520	3223280	So in this case, you can go collect a large database of images and study its properties.
3223280	3227000	How is light organized in these images?
3227000	3232920	And one thing you find is that in any color channel, this is supposed to be red, blue and green,
3232920	3237400	you'll find that the distribution of the intensity of pixels,
3237400	3241440	you know, if you look at the brightness of different pixels, it's very, very skewed.
3241440	3243800	There are lots of pixels which are pretty dim,
3243800	3248400	but then there's a very long tail with some pixels that are enormously bright.
3248400	3252760	So it doesn't matter where you go, you do this inside a city, you do this at the North Pole,
3252760	3255200	you do this in a jungle, you do it wherever you want,
3255200	3257200	you're going to find that this is the case.
3257200	3260840	It's a very universal feature of the visual world.
3260840	3263480	And it has an important consequence.
3263480	3269680	The average intensity of a pixel is lower than the median.
3269680	3276840	Median means the median intensity is the intensity at which half the pixels are dimmer and half are brighter.
3276840	3282200	So the median exceeds the mean in the world.
3282200	3286040	There's another fact, which is that there are long range correlations.
3286040	3289120	What do I mean by that? This is some technical figure showing that,
3289120	3292960	but what we really mean is, you know, if it's kind of red here, it's going to be kind of red here,
3292960	3296200	it's going to be kind of red here, and then after a little while it's improbable
3296200	3298480	where the color is going to persist forever.
3298480	3302000	But there's a very particular structure of those correlations which you can measure.
3302000	3306080	It's a regularity of the natural world that you can measure.
3306080	3310800	So you would think that, well, if I'm going to detect bright dark spots,
3310800	3312560	maybe that's related to these statistics.
3312560	3316920	And actually, without even doing anything, we can immediately argue,
3316920	3323240	and let me argue to you now that these two facts, that light is correlated over distances
3323240	3328960	and that you have the median light intensity exceeds the average,
3328960	3332160	that immediately means that there are more dark spots in the world.
3332160	3334040	Here's how to see that, right?
3334040	3340000	So suppose what you do is you compare the light in a small region here
3340000	3345200	to a large region there, right?
3345200	3355400	So what's going to happen is that if you measure,
3355400	3359320	if you compare the light in those two regions, because of these two statistical facts,
3359320	3363880	it's going to turn out that the spot in the middle is generally going to be darker
3363880	3364880	than the surrounding region.
3364880	3367840	That's just because the average, if you see the average here,
3367840	3370760	the average is less than this.
3370760	3372240	So that turns out to be the case.
3372240	3377920	So, for example, you can take a bunch of images and you can put down here a thing
3377920	3380960	that detects a bright spot, a thing that detects a dark spot,
3380960	3385280	and you can just count how many bright and dark spots you detect in every image,
3385280	3390040	and you'll find that no matter what angular size you look at,
3390040	3394400	there are more dark spots than there are bright spots.
3394400	3396840	So that's what this figure is supposed to be showing.
3396840	3399120	So we're going to ask a question based on this.
3399120	3402040	So let's agree that because of these statistical facts,
3402040	3406320	there are more dark spots than bright spots in the world.
3406320	3411080	So then we can ask, suppose I give you an allocation that you can buy,
3411080	3416480	or you can put in the eye, a certain number N of bright and dark spot detectors,
3416480	3419640	namely on and off cells.
3419640	3423720	So you get to divide them, you get to decide how many dark spot detectors
3423720	3426120	and how many bright spot detectors you have,
3426120	3432240	and my challenge here is to work out what would be best given the structure of the world.
3432240	3436360	So it's immediately clear that if you have only money to buy one cell,
3436360	3438600	it's better to buy a dark spot detector.
3438600	3440760	Why? Because there are more dark spots.
3440760	3442360	So it's more likely to respond.
3442360	3446280	So you're more likely to get useful things out of it.
3446280	3449560	If I give you two steps, then you buy some dark spot detectors
3449560	3451760	and you can cover the eye with them.
3451760	3453600	But then they're going to start overlapping.
3453600	3455760	So they're going to start telling you the same thing,
3455760	3459000	because they're overlapping, they're telling you redundant information.
3459000	3463320	So then you should buy some on cells, bright spot detectors,
3463320	3467840	and you can continue with this game and work out the mathematics of it
3467840	3473320	about how you should tile the retina with bright and dark spot detectors
3473320	3478800	in order to get the most information about the brightness of spots in the world.
3478800	3483040	So that's a mathematical problem that you can write down and solve.
3483120	3486400	And it turns out that the answer is about you should have one and a half
3486400	3490960	to about two times as many dark spot detectors in your system
3490960	3493240	if you want to say as much as you can,
3493240	3497320	given your budget of the number of cells, about bright and dark spots.
3497320	3501920	So we can ask, right, how does that compare with the actual eye?
3501920	3503560	So over the last two decades,
3503560	3506160	there have been a very large number of experiments on this.
3506160	3509320	So it used to be in the 1990s, for example,
3509320	3510920	if you asked people, they would talk about, you know,
3511880	3513760	white and dark equal on opposite,
3514120	3516840	but around the year 2000,
3516840	3518740	a series exactly as you'd predict
3519400	3522760	if the circuits of the eye
3522760	3526660	were adapted to the statistical structure of the world.
3526920	3528720	So exactly in that way.
3528720	3532120	So the collective organization, so that suggests,
3532120	3534760	so as I was saying according to the principal I mentioned,
3534760	3538200	that the collective structure of the retina, the object,

3563260	3566680	yw'r wider in the sensory world. Let's talk about smelling.
3566680	3570600	And we care about smelling, about orphaction
3570600	3574360	because it's in some ways the most primordial sense,
3574360	3580180	right, all living things sense molecules
3580180	3584000	So all living things smell in that sense, that every animal, most animals use smell
3584000	3589700	more importantly than vision to do their daily jobs.

3616520	3623240	wrth gwrs you can go consult with the people who do fragrances and flavours, you know people
3623240	3629520	who make artificial flavors and they will tell you that if you look at natural odors of different
3629520	3632620	kinds, foods, for other animals etc- typically an odour will contain fifty different kinds
3632620	3637440	of molecular species, so you could estimate from that that in terms of possible natural
3637440	3641400	smell it's like ten thousand to the fifty. This is such a vast number, it's even hard
3641400	3649400	That's the number of different things, like older objects, if you like, that you might have to sense in the world.
3649400	3657400	To make matters worse, the older environment changes, reflecting season circumstances and new opportunities.
3657400	3665400	So what do you need to do? Well, to detect a molecule, actually you need to feel its shape.
3665400	3671400	The identity of a molecule is basically defined by how all of its atoms are arranged in space.
3671400	3683400	So olfaction, the sense of smell, is a method used by the brain to sense the shapes of little things floating in the air.
3683400	3694400	So what do you need to do this? Well, it turns out that odors are sensed when molecules bind to receptors in the nose.
3694400	3700400	There's basically another molecule in a neuron in the nose, so that it's an olfactory sensory neuron.
3700400	3708400	The molecule will be sitting there, and then in will come some other molecule, an odorant, as it's called, floating in the air.
3708400	3718400	And if this molecule fits into the binding pocket of your sensor and sticks there, doesn't fall off, then the neuron will respond.
3718400	3727400	So this binding pocket, your olfactory sensory neuron, is literally feeling the shape of the molecule, whether or not it fits.
3727400	3737400	Now as it turns out, every receptor, olfactory receptor that allows you your sense of smell, is encoded by a separate gene.
3737400	3743400	That's because, you know, to make your receptors have different shapes because they're trying to feel out different shapes.
3743400	3749400	So to make a molecule, a protein, that has a different shape, you need a different gene to encode it.
3749400	3756400	For the genetic level, you know, they're all different genes. In fact, it's the biggest gene family in most animals.
3756400	3765400	So flies have about 100 of these, humans have about 300, and even the elephant only has about 2,000.
3765400	3779400	So this leads us to feel, looking at this, that somehow, you know, apparently animals can sense all the molecules in the world and all the combinations of the molecules in the world with just a few hundred receptors.
3779400	3786400	The reason this is very, very strange is you could phrase the difficulty of the problem in the following way.
3786400	3795400	You could say, suppose an odour is defined somehow by the concentrations of all the molecules in it.
3795400	3799400	Then it's possible that there are up to 10,000 different molecules.
3799400	3807400	So you put the first concentration of this side on this axis, you put the second concentration of this axis, the third concentration of this axis, et cetera.
3807400	3815400	There are 10,000 different axes on which you can draw all these concentrations, and somehow you have to represent all of this information
3815400	3823400	in the responses of just 500 neurons, let's say, or 300 neurons, and so it's the response of neuron one, the response of neuron two, the response of neuron three.
3823400	3832400	You just don't have, it would feel like there's no way to represent so much information about all the molecular concentrations with so few neural responses.
3832400	3836400	You could, just to make the problem more easy to visualise, consider the following thing.
3836400	3841400	Suppose I told you that you have positions in three-dimensional space, right? X, Y, Z, like that.
3841400	3853400	There are positions in three-dimensional space, and I insist to you that you tell me where you are in three-dimensional space by telling me just, you know, a coordinate if you're like a location in one dimension.
3853400	3859400	I mean, that's just really not, doesn't seem like it's very sensible, it's very hard to do, to do that, right?
3859400	3870400	Because you've got three directions, you could go up, you could go left, you could go right, and somehow encoding that in just one direction seems very hard, okay?
3870400	3877400	And what's more, you'd like to do that in a way that somehow preserves similarities and differences.
3877400	3883400	You need to be able to tell that this order is the same as this order, or similar to, and these two orders are very different.
3883400	3889400	So somehow the brain has to solve the problem of representing all of this information with very few neurons, right?
3889400	3897400	So a very high-dimensional space of orders, as they say, in a low-dimensional space of responses.
3897400	3903400	That's like going from three dimensions to one dimension, and it needs to do it in a way that preserves distances.
3904400	3915400	So an insight that's happened in neuroscience in the recent past is that actually there's a way in which you can do this by adapting to structure in the space of orders.
3915400	3926400	The structure is the following. We said already that if I look at, let's say, this order, it'll contain only a few molecules, let's say 50, and all the other things are absent.
3926400	3930400	This order contains this molecule and this molecule, and all the other ones are absent.
3930400	3938400	Each order in the natural world contains about 50 odorant molecules, right? 50 types of odorant molecules.
3938400	3952400	So it turns out that there's a theorem in mathematics that you could take signals like this if they came to you and store them with many fewer responses than the number of things that are coming in
3953400	3961400	if every sensor bound to all the molecules that are coming in kind of randomly.
3961400	3973400	It's a rather than being structured like, you know, in vision, you have the cell that pulls out a bright spot and you have a cell that pulls out the dark spot or left to right motion and things like this.
3973400	3981400	So instead of doing that, if you just said, here's an olfactory receptor, I kind of wanted to bind kind of randomly to everything and just give me a sort of mishmash of numbers.
3981400	3991400	So there's a theorem in math that says if you do that, you could store all the information that's there in the odor world with a few hundred receptors.
3991400	3993400	So there's a theorem like that.
3993400	3998400	So the question is, does the olfactory system use randomness in that way?
3998400	4001400	That's a very different kind of organization, mind you, than the visual system.
4001400	4002400	That's why I'm giving this example.
4002400	4008400	In the visual system, everything is highly structured because the visual world is highly structured.
4008400	4013400	And here the idea would be, the math would tell you that it should be kind of random what it does.
4013400	4029400	And indeed, so here's a picture of different receptors in the fruit fly binding to many different odorant molecules and the darkness of the color tells you the strength of the response.
4029400	4039400	Now this doesn't look entirely random, and it isn't entirely random, but there's a sense, a mathematical sense, in which this is sufficiently random.
4039400	4042400	It's pretty close to random.
4042400	4054400	So much so that the, so this is, so in other words, basically what happens is that every olfactory receptor here is binding to many, many odorant molecules.
4054400	4058400	That every odorant molecule is binding to many, many receptors.
4058400	4060400	So this is a highly multiplexed thing.
4060400	4064400	It's not like one receptor tells you this molecule is there, or this receptor tells you this molecule is there.
4064400	4070400	It's like every receptor binds to everything at some level, and every molecule binds to everything.
4070400	4076400	So this is a highly multiplexed kind of description of the odor world that appears in the nose.
4076400	4083400	So this is what's called a kind of combinatorial code in the jargon of the field.
4083400	4084400	And this continues.
4084400	4090400	So this is a drawing, a diagram of your early olfactory system.
4090400	4092400	So you have all the molecules in the world.
4092400	4099400	This is a vector, this is a figure showing concentrations of which molecules are present.
4099400	4104400	They bind to different receptors, you know, they're all colored differently.
4104400	4109400	And then what happens is that the signals from the receptors are collected at a second stage.
4109400	4112400	That's what's drawn here in the picture by Camilo Golgi.
4112400	4118400	So the schematic that I've drawn here is actually this thing that I've simplified.
4118400	4120400	And at this stage it's all cleaned up.
4120400	4127400	And then it turns out that the signals from here project to your central brain, to the cortex also in a random way.
4127400	4133400	So once again you get this sort of randomness and the information is kind of spread out all over the place.
4133400	4145400	And you can show, and so that's what I was trying to argue to you, is that so you might be surprised if you studied vision, you might be surprised by this.
4145400	4154400	Why is vision so structurally organized with all these little feature detectors pulling out different things in the world and sending the brain and so on?
4154400	4157400	And why does olfaction look so random?
4157400	4167400	So what I tried to argue to you is that the collective organization here in the olfactory system, the system of smell, is via randomness as opposed to structure,
4167400	4172400	because that's what you need mathematically to be able to process signals of this kind.
4172400	4179400	So in both cases, in both vision and olfaction, in one case the structure, in the other case the sort of randomness in the circuit,
4179400	4186400	are associated with adapting the circuit to process efficiently the information in the world.
4186400	4190400	So that's what I'm trying to convey here.
4190400	4197400	By the way, I'm trying to give you some of the technical details here, because often I find that in these kinds of lectures, when I listen to public lectures,
4197400	4204400	there's lots of pretty words, but I don't have a sense that something can actually be done, something concrete.
4204400	4210400	I'd like you to go away with the sense that this is completely concrete, you can do these calculations, you can do these measurements.
4210400	4216400	This is a completely concrete thing, and that's in the details of this kind of analysis.
4216400	4221400	That's why I'm giving you some of these details, so you have a sense of how this works.
4221400	4225400	So I'm going to give you one more example, and then stop.
4225400	4228400	So the example I'm going to talk about is now learning.
4228400	4235400	So far I've talked about adaptation in evolutionary selection of circuits to be adapted to the world.
4235400	4241400	And now I want to talk about something that isn't evolutionary selection for adaptation to the world, but rather involves learning.
4241400	4243400	So there are songbirds.
4243400	4248400	Here are two kinds of songbirds, zebra finches and the brown-headed cowbird.
4248400	4256400	And famously, songbirds learn to sing by imitation practice and innovation.
4256400	4260400	By the way, the reason why we should care is humans do the same thing.
4260400	4263400	Here's a human learning by practice.
4263400	4270400	So that is a very important part of animal activity, to learn by practice and to get good at something.
4270400	4272400	So how do songbirds learn?
4272400	4277400	Well, it turns out that juvenile male bird dabbles and just goes on like that.
4277400	4288400	And then over weeks, it learns to sing clearly partly through imitation because its song will partly imitate the songs it hears often of its parent with some innovation.
4288400	4293400	And then the adult male bird sings to female birds often seeking a mate.
4293400	4300400	And then the female birds seem to evaluate these songs and then decide which one or which ones to accept.
4300400	4304400	And this is all really important, right? It matters.
4304400	4313400	Because for example, in social species like this cowbird, the males and females work out a kind of social hierarchy based on their singing to each other.
4313400	4321400	And then they produce pair bonds and the success of those pair bonds is absolutely critical for later success in egg laying.
4321400	4324400	You don't make the pair bonds, the colony doesn't produce very many eggs.
4324400	4332400	So it's actually really important for the survival of the species that this is all well organized and that the males learn to sing.
4332400	4334400	So how do they do this?
4334400	4341400	So now, let me tell you about how all of these circuits I've talked about reorganize themselves.
4341400	4348400	They reorganize themselves when neurons, which are connected to each other, autonomously rewire their circuits.
4348400	4352400	There's a rule, they'll use the rule to reorganize.
4352400	4360400	There are various sorts of rules and one of the rules, one of these mechanisms is called spike timing dependent plasticity.
4360400	4362400	So let me give you an example.
4362400	4366400	Suppose you have two neurons, one and two, and they're connected and here's a synapse between them.
4366400	4370400	Suppose, for some reason, they both fire.
4370400	4375400	They both produce these voltage spikes that I talked about at the beginning of the top.
4375400	4380400	Suppose neuron one fires before neuron two.
4380400	4383400	You could have a rule that says the synapse strengthens.
4383400	4393400	Or you could have a rule that the first, and also the second part of the rule says that neuron one fires after the second one the synapse weakens.
4393400	4396400	So this is just a local rule, right?
4396400	4397400	I mean, it's just a dynamical rule.
4397400	4402400	You've got two dumb objects, neuron one and neuron two talking to each other, and they just have a rule.
4402400	4407400	They have the strength of the synapse, the weak of the synapse, depending on who goes first.
4407400	4409400	You can modify this a little bit.
4409400	4413400	There are things called neuromodulators, which are sort of chemicals that the brain uses.
4413400	4417400	And these can be used as global knobs to affect how this happens.
4417400	4421400	So for example, there's a thing called dopamine, which if dopamine is released here,
4421400	4428400	it can reinforce changes that have happened, that happened to have led offline to some sort of reward.
4428400	4433400	So if there's a reward, you know, they'll do something to help cement some change that's happened to synapse.
4433400	4439400	There's other things that can help a nephrin that also, you know, allow emotion to control how these synapses changes and everything.
4439400	4443400	And you could put all of these rules on computers and see what they do and so on.
4443400	4448400	It just seems really implausible at first sight that something so stupid, if you like,
4448400	4453400	can actually lead to things like actual learning of things you might care about in the case of the birds,
4453400	4457400	for example, allowing them to learn songs.
4457400	4459400	But let's see.
4459400	4464400	So how does song learning actual work in the actual brains of birds?
4464400	4466400	So here's the bird brain.
4466400	4470400	And what's written down here is all the different major brain areas.
4470400	4472400	Remember, we talk about brain areas.
4472400	4477400	And these are the brain areas that sort of cooperate collectively to help the bird to learn songs.
4477400	4484400	Three important ones are HVCR and L-Man acronyms with some historic provenance.
4484400	4490400	What's very interesting about the system is that this region, RA, has neurons in it,
4490400	4493400	which are the things that control the muscles.
4493400	4495400	So these are the things that actually produce the song.
4495400	4505400	So a sequence of firing of the neurons in the region RA will make a whole bunch of muscles go back and forth in the bird's throat
4505400	4507400	and thereby produce the song.
4507400	4509400	So that's the thing that makes song.
4509400	4513400	So to make a song, of course, you need to control those muscles in a particular order,
4513400	4518400	control these muscles first, and these muscles, and these muscles, and these muscles, and these muscles,
4518400	4519400	and that makes the song.
4519400	4522400	So that's what you've got to learn.
4522400	4528400	So RA also gets input from another area called HVCR.
4528400	4531400	And HVCR acts as a conductor.
4531400	4537400	So the neurons in this area produce patterns like this, and this, and this, and this, and this, if you like,
4537400	4542400	but it's actually patterns of neuron firing, and they provide a time base.
4542400	4551400	Every pattern of firing of neurons in this area HVCR marks out a different time in the song.
4551400	4553400	It's literally conducting the song.
4553400	4562400	So when HVCR produces this pattern, certain neurons here in the area RA should fire thereby pushing certain muscles.
4562400	4569400	When neurons in HVCR fire in some other pattern, then some other neurons in RA should fire producing another push,
4569400	4571400	a different kind of push in the muscles.
4571400	4572400	So that's what should be happening.
4572400	4574400	That's what it's got to learn.
4574400	4578400	As the conductor marks out time, different muscles get pushed.
4578400	4580400	So how does it learn this?
4580400	4586400	There's a third area called L-man, which is a tutor area.
4586400	4589400	And this tutor area does two things.
4589400	4591400	First, it drives exploration.
4591400	4596400	You see, part of the problem is that the bird doesn't know which neurons control which muscles.
4596400	4598400	You don't know that.
4598400	4603400	Just like baby doesn't know how to move its neurons in its head in order to control their muscles.
4603400	4605400	It's something you learn.
4605400	4607400	So here L-man does two things.
4607400	4613400	One is it drives exploration by injecting a little bit of randomness in the firing of RA
4613400	4620400	that allows the neurons there to do slightly different things every time to explore what can be done.
4620400	4623400	The other thing it does is it provides guidance.
4623400	4631400	So this area gets back a message that says how did the output compare to a remembered song
4631400	4635400	and based upon those differences between what you wanted and what you got,
4635400	4639400	it's able to provide some guidance about which synapses to change or well.
4639400	4642400	That was a good thing you did, or that was a bad thing you did.
4642400	4645400	It's able to provide guidance of this kind.
4645400	4650400	So that's at the level of these brain areas collectively talking to each other.
4650400	4654400	What about at the level of the individual neurons and the synapses?
4654400	4659400	Because somehow here at the end every neuron is a dumb little thing
4659400	4663400	and all it knows is a dumb little rule about how to change.
4663400	4675400	So it turns out that right here there are synapses between the conductor neurons and the student neurons
4675400	4678400	which have the following property.
4678400	4688400	So if the conductor sends a message to the student before the tutor, the synapse strengthens.
4688400	4695400	If the conductor sends a message to the student at the same time as the tutor,
4695400	4698400	then the synapse weakens.
4698400	4704400	That's a measurement in this system and otherwise basically nothing happens.
4704400	4708400	This is for this particular synapse and this particular bird, this is the zebra finch.
4708400	4711400	Other birds and other synapses can have different rules.
4711400	4719400	So it would be a legitimate question to ask whether can such a stupid rule actually allow a bird to learn a song.
4719400	4725400	So you can check that and the way neuroscientists or at least theoretical neuroscientists will do this
4725400	4728400	is they'll build a computer model of the system.
4728400	4731400	So you make a model of the conductor area as a bunch of neurons.
4731400	4735400	You allow the conductor neurons to send signals to all the student neurons.
4735400	4740400	Then you say there's a tutor and you get the tutor to send messages to the student neurons too
4740400	4744400	and then you say I want the student to learn a particular pattern of firing and you press go
4744400	4750400	and you say can such a stupid rule, this spike timing dependent plasticity rule
4750400	4754400	where depending upon who fires first you strengthen a weakened synapse, can that work.
4755400	4761400	So amazingly this is capable of learning the correct sequential outputs.
4761400	4767400	You just tell it that I want this sequence of firing in this area, it can learn that output.
4767400	4773400	But there's an interesting finding you can find out this way and that is the learning works better
4773400	4780400	if the teaching style of the tutor matches the learning style of the student,
4780400	4782400	the kind of thing you hear in kindergarten.
4782400	4789400	So basically it could be that the neuron has this spike timing dependent plasticity rule.
4789400	4793400	If A goes before B then you strengthen, if B goes before A you weaken.
4793400	4796400	Or it could have this spike timing dependent plasticity rule.
4796400	4801400	You strengthen so long as both of these fire close to each other.
4801400	4803400	There are many different rules different neurons implement.
4803400	4810400	So it turns out that for some of these rules of learning that an individual synapse could implement
4810400	4815400	it turns out the tutor should teach the student, give it signals
4815400	4820400	so that it learns early segments of the song before late segments of the song.
4820400	4826400	That's the way it's going to work best given that rule of how the learning at the synapse works.
4826400	4834400	But for other students by which I mean other kinds of synaptic plasticity or learning rules at the synapse
4834400	4837400	you'll find that the teacher should just teach the whole song all the time,
4837400	4842400	just keep giving corrections everywhere and it'll work better, it'll just work faster.
4842400	4846400	That's a very interesting finding and this is intended to illustrate two things.
4846400	4849400	One is this kind of learning, it's a collective effect.
4849400	4854400	The whole brain cooperates and the synapses have to do things.
4854400	4858400	So it's a collective of everything that's doing this effect.
4858400	4863400	The first statement, the other statement is this kind of theoretical computer modelling
4863400	4868400	that's now possible given I told you earlier that you could build a model of a neuron
4868400	4871400	and why not put it on a computer and just see what it does.
4871400	4875400	You can now do that kind of thing and learn a great deal, in fact this is a prediction
4875400	4880400	for things that ought to be measurable in different kinds of birds and different kinds of synapses.
4880400	4886400	So we're now at the stage where you can have the style of science that was in physics
4886400	4890400	which is that you can have theory, you can have experiment, the theories make predictions,
4890400	4893400	you can have experiments, experiments refine the theories etc.
4893400	4897400	That is a mode of doing science that's been basically absent from much of neuroscience,
4897400	4901400	from much of biology and that is now becoming possible because we have so many tools
4901400	4903400	and so much knowledge of all of this.
4903400	4908400	I'm basically out of time so I'm not going to talk about the circuits that underlie a sense of space
4908400	4915400	unless you ask me during question time which can tell you more and instead I'm going to conclude.
4915400	4923400	So the point of my talk today was to try to suggest to you, say something about how our brains make us
4923400	4928400	and the kind of point I want to try to make to you is that inside our head we're all collectives.
4928400	4933400	It's not like there's a thing which is you, there's just lots of neurons, lots of neurons are connected,
4933400	4936400	lots of circuits, the circuits are connected into brain areas
4936400	4940400	and collectively the emergent effect of all of this is you.
4940400	4945400	I tried to illustrate that by looking at various examples and special cases of different kind,
4945400	4947400	in particular for example this learning.
4947400	4952400	Another point that I'd like to emphasize is that in essentials all animals are the same.
4952400	4958400	This turtle and my daughter at an earlier age are basically in all essentials they're the same.
4958400	4964400	All of the stuff we like about the fancy thinking we do is a veneer on top of that.
4964400	4966400	Nevertheless there's a lot more to discuss.
4966400	4973400	So for example we're very interested as humans in decision making, social behavior, things like curiosity and creativity,
4973400	4980400	language which humans have a particular faculty for language, abstract thought which matters to us
4980400	4986400	and we'd like to understand the origins of all of these behaviors in neural circuits
4986400	4988400	and actually there's progress on this.
4988400	4994400	Just in the last 20 years or last 10 years there are more and more tools for studying all of these things
4994400	5003400	and I anticipate that the next decade we'll see lots of progress in understanding the neural circuit origin of these sorts of behaviors.
5003400	5008400	Then usually most people are interested in the even broader question.
5008400	5014400	One of the things you prize about ourselves is sentience and consciousness.
5014400	5016400	So we'd like to know what are these states?
5016400	5018400	They're clearly states of brain.
5018400	5021400	We don't all say that rocks are sentient or conscious.
5021400	5023400	They're states of brain.
5023400	5033400	But we don't quite know how to define even what sentience and consciousness even mean in general let alone at the circuit level.
5033400	5037400	We'd like to know from this how does mind emerge from brain.
5037400	5043400	But I actually think that we will make progress on these questions in the next 100 years.
5043400	5046400	That might seem like a long time but it isn't really.
5046400	5048400	People live to 100.
5048400	5051400	If you think about it we have come a heck of a long way since Cahal.
5051400	5058400	Cahal had pictures of lots of different neurons and suggested that neurons are central to how the brain works.
5058400	5059400	So there are these different things.
5059400	5061400	They're like the atomic constituents of brains.
5061400	5065400	And think about all the things I've been able to say today and I even only just scratched the surface.
5065400	5073400	So 100 years from now I think there's every chance that we'll be able to give some sort of definition of what we want to mean by something that's conscious or sentient
5073400	5077400	and understand how those states arise from neural circuits.
5077400	5078400	So I'm going to stop there.
5094400	5096400	So we'll go ahead and open it up for Q&A.
5096400	5098400	I think we have room for about two questions.
5098400	5099400	That's okay?
5107400	5119400	So in your opinion what would be the best way to learn a new language?
5124400	5127400	You're asking the tutor should start at the beginning of the sentence only?
5127400	5128400	Where's the nothing?
5130400	5132400	That's really not clear.
5132400	5136400	I mean there are different learning styles that people have.
5136400	5148400	So some people, my wife for example is very good at languages and always talks about how when she learned Arabic the grammar was what really attracted her.
5148400	5154400	There's this very regular structure to that language and learning that grammar helped her to understand the language and everything.
5154400	5156400	My dad is very good at languages.
5156400	5157400	He speaks seven languages.
5158400	5173400	And from him I get an impression of a kind of, on the one hand he just listens to it and reads it and then somehow on the way on the side studies grammar.
5173400	5175400	It's a very different mode.
5175400	5180400	It's also the case that the young and the old learn language in very different ways.
5181400	5187400	Children just listen to it and they just pick the whole thing up somehow holistically.
5187400	5195400	There's a certain stage, there's a critical period where you can do that and after that critical period the mode in which you learn language is known to be different.
5195400	5203400	So it's much more useful when you're older to have structures like grammar and things like that and consciously be aware of them and to learn them.
5203400	5215400	So there used to be this idea, well there is this idea due to Noam Chomsky of something called a universal grammar that's sort of embedded in these kinds of circuits that I've talked about, that it's just built in.
5215400	5225400	All humans have the faculty for this and that in early childhood when you learn languages what you're doing is pruning away bits of that that you don't need.
5225400	5230400	It's a little bit like all of those neurons, those interneurons, the retina that sort of take away all the stuff you don't need.
5230400	5238400	So the idea is that you sort of prune those away and you're left with a structure pertent to the language that you're going to speak in your local area.
5238400	5255400	Now with the advent of things like chat GPT and this sort of remarkable linguistic abilities there's some discussion, I mean there's debates about whether people agree or disagree still with this proposition.
5255400	5268400	So I think that's a little bit up in the air because of this particular, if you think about chat GPT as a development in computational linguistics that's raised some questions about this notion of a universal grammar whether it's really there or not.
5268400	5284400	I mean personally I think they're going to find that and I think the reason why things like chat GPT work is that there is a underlying regular structure in all human language and this is an engine that's built in such a way that it's able to extract that structure in the language.
5284400	5293400	And so I think people are going to want to understand how to piece apart these artificial engines and work out what they're actually doing inside their inards.
5293400	5296400	I think we will find that there is such a structure.
5296400	5300400	So it's different strategies for young and old, it's also clearly different for different people.
5300400	5305400	I'm not sure that's a sufficient answer to what your question but there you go.
5314400	5318400	I'm coming, I'm coming.
5318400	5319400	Oh, thank you.
5319400	5327400	Yes, you touched on something which was related to my question which is the effect of age.
5327400	5332400	You know this working in these mathematical schematics that you have.
5332400	5337400	I'm a senior and I think there are a lot of seniors in this room.
5337400	5340400	So can you speak to that?
5340400	5342400	Yeah.
5342400	5361400	So age produces many effects on the structure of the brain in part because adults basically don't get new neurons.
5361400	5365400	There are two regions of the brain where you do.
5365400	5384400	So in the olfactory system, so in this structure drawn by Golgi, this one over here, you actually get new neurons as you age, which is very interesting because nobody understands why.
5385400	5400400	The other area where you get new neurons even when you're older is the hippocampus, which I mentioned here but didn't really talk about, which is the area associated with the learning memory navigation and things like that.
5400400	5415400	So these two areas, you do get new neurons and their appearance and their placement within the circuit and where they synapse is known to be associated with the production in the hippocampus anyway of new memories.
5415400	5424400	So one of the things that happens in people who have memory loss is that system isn't working quite as well.
5424400	5428400	You're not getting enough neurons, you're not synaphing properly.
5428400	5432400	But we know the locus of that.
5432400	5437400	Maybe there is a day will come when you can encourage the production of new neurons.
5437400	5446400	So you could make the argument that part of the reason we developed these age-related problems is maybe humans didn't originally live that long.
5446400	5448400	Most people died young.
5448400	5453400	They were eaten, they died of disease, they died of war, young.
5453400	5464400	So at an earlier time in human history, we wouldn't have needed, well, in the general populace, populace to kind of maintain all of these structures of that problem.
5464400	5471400	So maybe that's been changing and we're unfortunately stuck with an earlier evolutionary program.
5471400	5472400	That's what's going on.
5472400	5476400	So it's possible that those things can help.
5476400	5480400	And also, you know, in general, ageing produces effects on all your cells.
5480400	5488400	So there's things called telomeres that are at the end of chromosomes.
5488400	5494400	And as you make copies of cells, the telomere is shortened.
5494400	5500400	And if they get shortened so much that they're not really delimiting the ends of the chromosomes, then you start running into problems.
5500400	5507400	Because, you know, the program for transcribing genes to make proteins and things won't work as well.
5507400	5508400	So that's another issue.
5508400	5510400	But not all creatures have that.
5510400	5516400	So there are creatures that are essentially immortal that don't have this telomere shortening.
5516400	5520400	They basically die when they're eaten or they don't get food.
5520400	5526400	There's a jellyfish that gets younger at some point.
5526400	5531400	It seems to get younger and then age again sort of oscillates in its effective age.
5531400	5533400	Very strange.
5533400	5534400	Very interesting.
5534400	5536400	We'd all love that.
5536400	5542400	And these are all subjects of the study of ageing.
5542400	5545400	There's actually even weirder stuff still, right?
5545400	5550400	Just to reveal the set of possibilities that can happen.
5550400	5553400	So there's a creature called Hydra.
5553400	5555400	You can chop it into two.
5555400	5556400	It's got a nerve net.
5556400	5558400	It doesn't have a brain.
5558400	5559400	It has a nerve net.
5559400	5564400	So there are nerves all over it that's kind of hooked up in a kind of neural network that operates Hydra.
5564400	5567400	I'm mostly talking about creatures with centralized brains.
5567400	5570400	But some creatures actually have a nerve net that's kind of spread about.
5570400	5572400	You can chop Hydra in two.
5572400	5574400	It'll make two Hydras.
5574400	5580400	You can take Hydra and put it in a blender and kind of separate its cells, all separate.
5580400	5581400	You put it back together.
5581400	5582400	It makes a Hydra.
5582400	5584400	All the cells find their location.
5584400	5587400	I'd love to be like Hydra when I grow up.
5587400	5601400	So the biology, the living things have many, many, many tricks that we're only just beginning to plumb the depths off.
5601400	5604400	And so I think in time we will learn to do these tricks.
5604400	5608400	Heck, you lose a finger in a circular saw.
5608400	5610400	There's no reason why you can't grow it back.
5610400	5612400	I mean that the program is there.
5612400	5614400	So I'm not talking about neurons now.
5614400	5616400	I'm talking about the rest of the body.
5616400	5618400	But all of these things are in principle possible.
5618400	5622400	We just need to know how to unlock within the, in that case, the circuits.
5622400	5630400	I mean you can think about the organization of your body in terms of the circuits of what cells communicate with what, what turns, what on, etc.
5630400	5632400	It should be possible.
5632400	5634400	We just haven't figured out how.
5634400	5637400	And likewise with the brain and with the problems of aging and everything.
5637400	5644400	You know, once we understand how these circuits work, there's no reason why we can't get them to do what we want.
5644400	5645400	These are machines.
5645400	5647400	We're machines.
5647400	5650400	And if you can repair a car, you can repair the head.
5661400	5663400	Thank you so much, Vijay.
5663400	5666400	And be sure to join us for our next set of lectures.
5666400	5670400	We have our ulams coming up in September, September 19th and 20th.
5670400	5672400	Have a good night.
