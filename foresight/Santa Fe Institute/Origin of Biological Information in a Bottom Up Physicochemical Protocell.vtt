WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
He wasn't established a long time, his long career career back then is five.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.520
He works on a whole bunch of physical principles related to origins of life,

00:07.520 --> 00:12.000
pro-cells, after biology. It was his pleasure to have him here today, PhD.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.520
Thank you. Yeah, it's certainly also, it's always wonderful to be back here and

00:17.520 --> 00:21.440
nice to see a number of known faces and some new ones too.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.680
Some of you know that I've been a bit obsessed with,

00:25.680 --> 00:30.640
we're trying to create life in the lab for many years.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.280
When I was younger, I thought I'd be long done by now, but it's not so easy.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.920
So what I'll present here today is our latest work on computational work, theoretical work,

00:43.920 --> 00:49.280
on the missing link to actually implement a living system in the lab.

00:49.840 --> 00:57.280
And I want to emphasize my collaborators here, and we have Christopher Thompson

00:57.280 --> 01:02.720
and Marco Toccio. They are two recent graduate students I've had, and you guys

01:02.720 --> 01:07.760
of course know Artemis. He's been here for a long time at SFI.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.880
Hansiak is an old friend from Los Alamos and Didliu.

01:11.600 --> 01:16.640
Bornebush is also one of my previous graduate students.

01:16.880 --> 01:24.640
So, I'll focus on the question of how to get information into a self-replicating

01:24.640 --> 01:29.920
molecular machine. This has been an issue we haven't been able to solve experimentally yet.

01:31.200 --> 01:37.200
So, if I can figure out, and it doesn't work this year,

01:37.520 --> 01:47.920
I can also use this one here. So, I think that most of us would agree that

01:49.440 --> 01:53.200
if we want to have a transition from non-living to living matter,

01:54.400 --> 02:02.240
then it has to be characterized by the origin of some functional information that can

02:02.480 --> 02:10.400
tell how to build this living matter. So, the goal is to demonstrate how particular

02:10.400 --> 02:16.960
molecular reaction networks they can generate and store this kind of information.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.520
I guess it looks smart, but it isn't.

02:22.080 --> 02:35.280
So, my answer is to start with a metabolism. I think this is really the key, and I'll try to

02:35.280 --> 02:40.880
argue for that, because there's still some discussion in the community about

02:41.680 --> 02:47.360
what came first, the chicken on the egg here. It's clear that energy is needed and information

02:47.440 --> 02:51.440
is needed. There has to be some kind of containment also, but I really think that

02:51.440 --> 03:00.160
one should focus on the energetics in the beginning. So, imagine we have an energy gradient,

03:00.160 --> 03:06.400
some free energy available. We can then use this free energy to turn resources into building blocks,

03:07.200 --> 03:14.480
and the key is to have a catalyst that can be in more than one state. So, there can be a selection

03:14.480 --> 03:21.440
of catalysts if these building blocks, they will actually also be, or one or more of them,

03:21.440 --> 03:26.800
will be catalysts. So, we are in a situation where we provide energy from the environment,

03:27.360 --> 03:32.960
so we start with resources, and then we end up with building blocks. Of course, the desired

03:32.960 --> 03:39.440
situation is that we lift our building blocks up, so we get more complex building blocks that are

03:39.440 --> 03:48.400
energetically higher up, but it's also okay if we can just make new materials by this process.

03:51.200 --> 03:56.160
And of course, this is not clear why this is true, at least some people say it is not clear.

03:56.160 --> 04:02.800
So, therefore, I've tried to state two questions here. Why focus on metabolism? Is metabolism

04:02.800 --> 04:09.600
really primary to information since our topic is mainly information? And how is a good metabolic

04:09.600 --> 04:18.160
catalyst selected and up-concentrated if you have a system like this here? Free energy available,

04:18.160 --> 04:22.560
you use this energy to turn resources into building blocks, where one of the building blocks is

04:22.560 --> 04:31.520
actually a catalyst that can catalyze its own formation. So, we have an order catalysis. And

04:31.520 --> 04:40.640
for some of you, this is, you already know that, but I want to emphasize that if we look at a molecular

04:40.640 --> 04:49.440
system that has different states, let's see that it has w different states, then we know from Boltzmann

04:49.440 --> 04:57.040
that it can encode information to the amount of the equation of PIS, which is information is equal

04:57.040 --> 05:08.560
to Boltzmann's constant and the natural logarithm of the possible states. And there is information

05:08.560 --> 05:16.560
represented many places in living systems, the most well-known sequential equation, DNA, RNA,

05:16.560 --> 05:24.640
proteins and so forth. But I want to emphasize that information can also be present as conformational

05:24.640 --> 05:32.320
information where an aggregate can be composed of different components and then the how many

05:32.320 --> 05:40.160
components and in high concentrations will also represent the information. This is the one Lancet

05:40.160 --> 05:46.960
that has introduced that and sequential information like we have in DNA and RNA and proteins, etc.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.160
That's a particular kind of compositional information. Compositional information is more

05:52.720 --> 06:08.480
general. So if we take Boltzmann's equation and the fundamental first law or sorry second law

06:09.200 --> 06:17.040
where we have that information or entropy here is equal to energy divided by t and then we insert

06:17.040 --> 06:27.440
this fundamental equation from thermodynamics into Boltzmann's equation. We get an equation we see

06:27.440 --> 06:37.520
here where we can eliminate or we can isolate e and then we get in a system where there are two

06:37.520 --> 06:44.800
states, we get an energy that is this big. And this was Landau that I think was first in pointing

06:44.800 --> 06:54.720
out that if you want to delete or create or store a bit of information there has to be

06:55.280 --> 07:05.200
it costs you something and the cost is about if you put in the room temperature and the value

07:05.200 --> 07:12.640
for the Boltzmann constant you get a small amount of energy. And I think this is a physics argument

07:12.640 --> 07:24.240
for why one has to look at free energy before one can think about information. And this is of

07:24.240 --> 07:34.000
course in line with all of our experiences whenever we have to write something we have to use energy

07:34.000 --> 07:43.440
computers use energy transmission of information on cables and you know

07:43.440 --> 07:48.480
satellites and what all of this is something we already know very well.

07:48.480 --> 07:57.360
Oh biological systems they also require energy to the replication machinery is energetically

07:58.240 --> 08:03.520
it needs energy. Can I ask you a question? Yeah yeah absolutely. So

08:07.280 --> 08:14.560
it's interesting that you're using Landau's principle as this you know the argument for why

08:14.560 --> 08:21.840
we need a metabolism. I mean I agree with all this but I just as far as I know I agree real

08:21.840 --> 08:28.000
metabolism is many orders of magnitude above that in the amount of heat it releases per bit.

08:28.880 --> 08:35.280
And so is that an indication that actually some other mechanism is making the metabolism

08:35.280 --> 08:43.360
necessary than Landau's principle? No no this is just this is just to state I mean you guys most

08:43.360 --> 08:51.680
of you are it's sort of you know preaching to the choir but for many people in the community

08:51.680 --> 08:56.880
that are interested in these things it's not obvious and it'll be contested but I

08:56.880 --> 09:03.520
know I think I know that I mean you need to use about two electron volts to split water

09:04.400 --> 09:12.880
so you need much more energy to do to run chemical reactions and how exactly how the

09:12.880 --> 09:20.480
relationship is between how much energy you have to to process or to run a chemical process

09:20.480 --> 09:26.880
compared to how much information there is I I'll not get into that here. I'll sort of try to

09:26.880 --> 09:33.360
put these two things together at the end. Yeah the ribosome which is running all these strings

09:33.760 --> 09:38.480
is about four times off the Landauer bound so it's real and then that machine is about half

09:38.480 --> 09:42.800
of cellular metabolism in bacteria so that's where one of these costs actually does get

09:42.800 --> 09:47.760
scaled all the way up to sort of cellular scale. It's only about four times that? It's four times

09:47.760 --> 09:53.920
that. Oh no I thought it was yeah hundreds or thousands of times. No no no it's not no

09:54.640 --> 10:00.240
but it but it is I mean we have I don't think anybody has actually reached the this limit

10:00.960 --> 10:11.280
has that been done I don't think so anyways so let's believe that we need to have free energy

10:11.280 --> 10:20.160
before we can have information and so then if that's true then we can go to the next question

10:20.160 --> 10:27.040
how is a metabolic catalyst selected and up concentrated because now we we agree that we

10:27.120 --> 10:35.280
actually need free energy to generate this catalyst and I will I'll claim that a catalyst

10:35.280 --> 10:41.760
is a sufficient condition for having a catalyst is that you have an energy transducer and a

10:41.760 --> 10:51.520
combinatorial cofactor in chemistry you have you have catalyst that speed up chemical processes

10:52.080 --> 10:58.720
and and if you have an energy transducer that's a that's a molecular machine that can turn

10:58.720 --> 11:03.760
one kind of energy into another kind of energy we're going to focus on how we can turn light

11:03.760 --> 11:09.920
energy into chemical energy and this can be modulated with a so-called cofactor and I'll get

11:09.920 --> 11:19.840
into that later so we so that's number one we actually require or assume that this catalyst

11:19.840 --> 11:25.520
is composed of an energy transducer and a combinatorial cofactor that can modulate it

11:26.320 --> 11:36.560
and a cofactor can be it does need to but it can be an an electron donor or an electron receptor

11:36.560 --> 11:43.840
depending on how the system is made up so that depending on how how well it donates electrons

11:43.840 --> 11:50.400
to to this energy transduction machinery the process will run faster or slower

11:53.440 --> 12:01.440
and if we also want this catalytic cofactor to be replicated then the question is how how is

12:01.440 --> 12:07.600
that possible I mean how what what kind of systems can both satisfy the first one that we have

12:08.320 --> 12:14.000
the catalyst being in a energy transducer and a combinatorial cofactor and it can also be

12:14.000 --> 12:20.400
replicated and and now as we go on I have to emphasize that I'm not trying to solve the

12:20.400 --> 12:25.840
origins of life I mean the historical origins of life here on earth we're just trying to create

12:25.840 --> 12:34.720
life in the lab from from non-living materials so so um so how do we think about this I mean we

12:35.520 --> 12:41.360
we've tried a number of different things and this is sort of the workhorse that we are currently

12:42.240 --> 12:48.560
believing in where we have a um you can see over here we have we have a

12:49.440 --> 12:56.080
vesicle fatty acid vesicle and on on this exterior of this vesicle we have anchored

12:57.200 --> 13:03.440
an energy transducer this is a ruthenium complex with a with a tail a hydrophobic tail

13:03.440 --> 13:12.240
and then we have a DNA duplex which is a cofactor so so here we have we have a sort of a blow-up

13:12.240 --> 13:21.040
up here we have the energy transducer and and it it's composed of both this molecular system that

13:21.040 --> 13:30.240
can capture light and and and then a a energy transducer that can deliver an electron and

13:30.240 --> 13:37.040
we have a little blue indication up here because it turns out that depending on what kind of

13:37.680 --> 13:45.280
bases we have in a DNA or an RNA or a pna strand uh we will have a good or a bad

13:46.640 --> 13:53.760
cofactor so so we have the we have this as a ruthenium complex and up here we have an oxygoinine

13:53.760 --> 14:03.440
because oxygoinine is a very good or reasonably good uh electron donor um so how how so how can

14:03.440 --> 14:10.240
this work i mean what what what does it do and and also how is how is this cofactor actually

14:10.240 --> 14:17.520
able to replicate because we know that replication without enzymes is is very very difficult can

14:17.520 --> 14:22.320
ask a question absolutely yeah i'm curious why you chose DNA instead of RNA since

14:23.520 --> 14:31.040
on auto catalysis has been RNA yeah that's more likely to auto-catalyze than DNA well it's simply

14:31.040 --> 14:38.720
because we uh DNA is much easier to work with it's much cheaper and and and if you look at

14:38.720 --> 14:45.600
charge transfer which we will focus on here it it's it's more difficult to do charge transfer

14:45.600 --> 14:52.400
in RNA than it is in DNA DNA literally thousands of papers out on charge transfer of DNA and all

14:52.400 --> 14:58.240
all kinds of different so so we and the reason why we're using ruthenium is also because it's the most

14:58.240 --> 15:05.840
studied uh uh energy transducer photo photocatalysis there is so so that's why the chemists they've

15:05.840 --> 15:18.240
chosen they've chosen that so just to indicate what we mean by this protocell and to to be

15:18.240 --> 15:23.440
interesting it has to go through a life cycle so remember before this was a protocell that

15:23.440 --> 15:29.520
is composed of in principle three different components the membrane i mean the vesicle

15:30.240 --> 15:37.600
uh this energy transducer and the cofactor then we feed the system with an oily substance

15:38.800 --> 15:46.560
that will then go into the membrane this is pigolinium ester and we can then by

15:49.040 --> 15:58.320
illuminating the system turn pigolinium ester into fatty acid and then that means that we get more

15:58.320 --> 16:04.320
membrane and as the membrane expands then the protocell gets gets bigger eventually if you

16:04.320 --> 16:10.160
run the process long enough then it will get unstable and it will divide and not in a controlled

16:10.160 --> 16:19.520
way but you'll get spotting events so as we do that or as this metabolic process runs we also

16:19.520 --> 16:29.440
provide a small oligomers which are pieces of DNA and they will then template if we make sure that

16:29.440 --> 16:35.680
this DNA has some certain properties which we'll get into a little later it has to have

16:37.360 --> 16:43.520
it has to have deletions and imperfections so it doesn't glue too strongly together so it's not

16:43.520 --> 16:50.720
hybridized too strongly then we can actually get a replication of these of these cofactors

16:51.280 --> 16:58.720
and then over time you'll eventually end up with with two or more sometimes not it doesn't divide

16:58.720 --> 17:03.520
but on average you actually do get more of these aggregates

17:04.160 --> 17:08.160
so

17:11.040 --> 17:17.840
how I promise to talk a little bit about how we can actually modulate a metabolism with the with

17:17.840 --> 17:24.720
the DNA yeah we've done a number of we've done experimental and theoretical work on this for

17:24.720 --> 17:35.600
many years this was our first life cycle of a of a protocell it was Mauer's PhD thesis

17:36.720 --> 17:43.440
where she demonstrated it where we actually have yeah anyways we we yeah it goes I don't want to

17:43.440 --> 17:48.560
get into details but we can actually show that that that you can that these that these vesicles

17:48.560 --> 17:55.680
they can grow and divide and by keep feeding this the guillenium ester we can actually get the system

17:55.680 --> 18:03.280
to generate more and more of these of these vesicles but here we don't have a replicating

18:05.520 --> 18:13.200
DNA strand we only have oxo guanine as a as an electron donor there isn't any so there isn't any

18:13.200 --> 18:17.680
inheritance so we have to provide new oxo guanine all the time

18:20.320 --> 18:29.840
so how how does it actually work if we want to have and have this process to to to act or have

18:29.840 --> 18:44.480
have this cofactor to act as a as a as a modulator and so here is the surface of the membrane the

18:44.480 --> 18:51.840
fatty acids are the green ones and the blue ones these are these oily the guillenium esters and as

18:51.840 --> 19:00.720
you illuminate the ruthenium complex which actually intercalates the self-assembles into the into

19:00.720 --> 19:10.160
the DNA then what happens is that you will steal this once once it gets activated it will steal a

19:10.960 --> 19:19.200
an electron from a guanine that is sitting in in the vicinity because once it gets activated then

19:19.200 --> 19:28.640
an electron jumps from the ruthenium metal out to one of these bipyridine antennas here

19:28.640 --> 19:35.520
and and then it'll steal an electron from the strand so now there is a hole there's a missing

19:35.520 --> 19:43.360
electron and it'll diffuse up and down the strand until it eventually will be absorbed by the oxo

19:43.360 --> 19:51.040
guanine and as we have an energy rich electron here it's been banged out there by the light

19:51.680 --> 20:00.000
then this electron can actually be used to to deprotect a picolinium ester and turn it into a

20:00.000 --> 20:08.560
fatty acid it needs to have a we need to have a sacrificial proton donor and then this process

20:08.560 --> 20:14.960
will go and then we don't we don't like to have a damage the oxo guanine so we need to have a the

20:14.960 --> 20:23.440
same what's it called or a proton donor here but at the end of the day we actually convert

20:24.320 --> 20:30.720
this oily substance into membrane so the system grows and this is modulated by the

20:30.720 --> 20:39.200
strand here because if if we can't if we can't get get rid of the hole then this this ruthenium

20:39.200 --> 20:46.480
complex is sort of say on it's not usable for one for one for the next for the next time

20:47.760 --> 20:52.320
it has to be you know it has to be it has it needs to have this electron back

20:52.880 --> 20:59.680
so what we've done here is looked at this process and tried to calculate

21:01.440 --> 21:04.640
how the strands they how well the strands they

21:06.240 --> 21:13.200
conduct these holes depending on the sequence and unfortunately that if you go to the literature

21:13.200 --> 21:19.680
I mean we don't have the measurements for that it's not all transition states that's

21:20.400 --> 21:24.960
actually published we don't know what the rate constants are from all these different

21:25.680 --> 21:31.280
combinations this is what we were able to to find and we had to we had to guesstimate some of them

21:31.280 --> 21:40.240
ourselves and these are either direct measurements or they are of an issue calculations I mean where

21:40.240 --> 21:49.280
you have quantum calculations of of of this system so we have the rates from for instance going from

21:50.640 --> 21:57.840
from an a to an a or from an from a g to an a etc and you can then you if you want to simulate

21:57.840 --> 22:07.520
such a system you can set up the matrix like this and you will then have the these rate constants

22:07.520 --> 22:16.560
they will determine how likely it is for you to go from one state to the other and mostly

22:16.560 --> 22:22.880
you see off diagonal you have diffusion and then every once in a while they are actually what we

22:22.880 --> 22:30.160
call super exchange where if you have a gc pair and then you have a gc pair a little I mean a

22:30.160 --> 22:36.400
couple of of three sides four sides further down you can actually have the hole to to tunnel

22:37.520 --> 22:43.760
the quantum tunnel for one from one to the next so what we've done we've first we looked at all

22:43.760 --> 22:49.200
these rates and when we realized we couldn't just we couldn't make all the rates on one hand they

22:49.200 --> 22:54.320
are all the sequences in the world on the one hand that was good because we didn't have simulation

22:54.320 --> 23:03.520
time to to simulate strands I think we we go on now I know we go up to about 18 strands of 18

23:04.480 --> 23:09.520
that's what's been we've also done experiments and other has done experiments with and if you

23:10.160 --> 23:18.960
take what what we know here and you then do the actually do the counting you can only construct

23:18.960 --> 23:25.840
or you can at most construct 160 strands so what we've done we have constructed these 160

23:25.840 --> 23:31.840
strands and then we've done the simulations we've then found these medium first passage

23:31.840 --> 23:44.960
time for the hole to to get up to the to the octagon and and and also we actually also

23:44.960 --> 23:53.040
calculated the the the mean there's a little bit of difference but how experimented what's it

23:54.160 --> 24:00.240
you said that you found mean first medium first passage time how did you find it

24:00.320 --> 24:06.240
no this was this was this is calculations these are calculations all of these transition

24:06.240 --> 24:13.600
this transition constants they are found either experimentally or they are found with first or

24:13.600 --> 24:20.240
I mean with with the quantum mechanical calculations or a couple of them we had to

24:20.880 --> 24:25.760
guesstimate because we couldn't find them in the literature but they probably are known I

24:25.760 --> 24:32.320
don't know it best to like 10 percent but for instance here you've said you know times like

24:32.320 --> 24:40.480
this 10 digits not 10 but five digits so is it just for fun what is for fun for instance this

24:40.480 --> 24:48.000
tau you've you said you know something with like four significant digits so five significant digits

24:48.000 --> 24:54.880
and this numbers you know rates you probably know with I don't know five percent ten percent

24:55.280 --> 24:59.440
oh yeah oh yeah I know don't know this don't worry about that yeah yeah no no no we don't know

24:59.440 --> 25:05.920
this should yeah no no no yeah so so so that that's just what that's what what the computer cranked

25:05.920 --> 25:12.960
out no no don't worry about all the all the digits there we are we just know what the order of magnitude

25:12.960 --> 25:23.200
is and that's it we cannot count on more any other questions yeah I don't understand right

25:23.200 --> 25:28.960
the idea here is to understand the timing it takes to saturate the electrons being trapped in the

25:28.960 --> 25:35.920
eight oxo yeah and then but yeah but then what limits you're assuming 18 base pairs of length

25:36.960 --> 25:43.040
these could grow I assume and no no no no no you have you have just think about think about uh

25:43.040 --> 25:48.800
don't think about any changes just think about a DNA yeah a duplex that has a certain length

25:48.800 --> 25:54.160
you can then place the oxygorne in different different different locations and you can you

25:54.160 --> 26:01.120
can then also have different ATs or GCs but then I'm thinking in your system you need the DNA to

26:01.120 --> 26:06.160
self replicate yeah okay that comes later they come longer than 18 base pairs no we don't we

26:06.160 --> 26:11.360
don't allow it to get longer because we we feed it with with with the pieces so we can make sure

26:11.360 --> 26:15.840
that it doesn't get any longer but that's that's sort of the that's that's actually the next step

26:15.840 --> 26:23.520
here you're too fast so so just to to show here what we got out of that so this is the histogram

26:23.520 --> 26:31.040
of all the of all the simulations this is where we have the slow ones is when we have the oxygorne

26:31.040 --> 26:38.960
above the ligation side and and this is the fast ones when we have the oxygorne below the ligation

26:38.960 --> 26:43.840
side that means it's close to the to the ruthenium complex which makes sense and then there's a

26:43.840 --> 26:49.520
bunch in the middle where it's more complicated what's happening so so that's the result of our

26:49.520 --> 26:57.760
our simulations now obviously there's much more going on than just charged charged transferred

26:57.760 --> 27:04.480
in the DNA if you look at this this is a I think we've gotten pretty much all of the reactions

27:04.480 --> 27:12.880
in here for our metabolism this is the ruthenium complex in ground state it's activated by light

27:12.960 --> 27:20.480
and then it can either jump back again or you can actually deliver this energized electron to

27:21.920 --> 27:30.080
to the to the DNA and you can then have the charge run up to the to the oxygorne you then

27:30.800 --> 27:38.160
destroy or you modify the what's it called the the oxygorne it actually loses a hydrogen

27:38.160 --> 27:44.880
atom and you then have to repair it and then you go around in this in this cycle here and

27:44.880 --> 27:55.200
then downstream as you as you go down to the ground state here with with the ruthenium

27:55.200 --> 28:05.520
then you can use this energy to convert picolinium ester into a into into a lipid into a fatty acid

28:06.000 --> 28:12.320
the canoic acid and and I don't want to get into all the details but we've started that both

28:12.320 --> 28:19.840
experimentally and and computationally theoretically and I so we know this system fairly well although

28:19.840 --> 28:25.360
all of the constants reaction constants are not known we they're not verified experimentally but

28:25.360 --> 28:31.920
you can when you simulate the system you can have some bounce on them in any way if you look at how

28:32.720 --> 28:40.800
look at the what determines the time for recharging the ruthenium complex

28:42.160 --> 28:50.720
this circular reaction is determined by the charge transfer reaction constant so

28:52.000 --> 29:00.000
if you want to to ensure that the charge transfer is is not too slow then we can figure out I mean

29:00.400 --> 29:10.800
there is we have this this rate that that is the excitation and then we have the

29:11.520 --> 29:17.280
a number of things that's going on up here but the time it takes is one over the rate

29:17.280 --> 29:24.640
plus the time it takes going around here and then we have a rate sort of a composed rate for the whole

29:24.640 --> 29:32.400
thing and if we say that we only allow the the charge transfer to slow the system with

29:33.040 --> 29:41.120
50 percent or with 10 percent or 1 percent we can we can actually get a bound on on this rate and

29:41.120 --> 29:49.520
we say that we only allow it to reduce the recharge with 1 percent and that means that we have a

29:49.520 --> 29:57.200
a rate constant in this charge transport to be that it has to be larger than

29:58.240 --> 30:05.040
five per sorry 50 per second and we'll require that for the as we go forwards

30:07.760 --> 30:16.480
any question yeah and it this this is this is complicated so now we go to what you asked with

30:16.560 --> 30:24.640
the replication how does that work and and the main sort of break that that the community got was

30:24.640 --> 30:34.960
with juliane gibbs she and her groups they figured out a way to to actually replicate

30:35.280 --> 30:46.080
DNA without enzymes by doing a a ligation reaction and and making sure that we don't have

30:46.640 --> 30:53.280
product inhibition and and the community has sort of been has been struggling i mean i had

30:53.280 --> 31:00.080
to pay several phd students we weren't able to solve it and i mean many many many people have

31:00.080 --> 31:12.880
tried to do DNA or RNA amplification with without luck and and it turns out that if you make if you

31:12.880 --> 31:21.440
make mismatches or bulges or air bases add that to the DNA strand you can actually get

31:21.680 --> 31:33.760
it exponential amplification by by by by having having these errors in in the DNA and and she

31:33.760 --> 31:42.240
calls it the lesion induced DNA amplification and and if you just look at it here then

31:42.240 --> 31:51.280
then we have some mismatches or some a basis that means it could be where there's no

31:52.640 --> 32:00.240
actually there's no base at all it's just a backbone and if you have have this destabilized

32:00.240 --> 32:08.320
enough then there is enough breathing in this short system so that when you feed it with with

32:08.320 --> 32:14.080
these resource strands here and provide an extra ruthenium complex you will actually be able to get

32:14.720 --> 32:20.880
and replication so that's how the replication happens and this has been demonstrated in the

32:20.880 --> 32:27.600
in the lab many many times many groups nobody so far has done it while the DNA has been anchored so

32:27.600 --> 32:33.440
that's something that has to be done yeah you start with mismatched yeah that's how this works but

32:33.440 --> 32:40.960
do you end up with a product that's mismatched yes interest because else you can't you can you can

32:40.960 --> 32:47.200
dehybridize interest so else you and that's that then you get a product inhibition so this is the

32:47.200 --> 32:53.840
main the main that that's the main i mean this is the the ingenious thing that that uh uh julie

32:54.400 --> 33:01.760
gives she did anyway so at the end of the the day we have a cofactor replication

33:03.360 --> 33:12.320
so now we can write down the reaction diagram you can see that here and then you end up with

33:13.440 --> 33:19.520
15 coupled ordinary differential equations i've written the first two ones there are 13 more

33:19.520 --> 33:26.880
and what's interesting here is if you look at the all the reactions almost all of them are of this

33:26.880 --> 33:33.920
form where you have two two reactions that turns into a third one or you have and all of it is

33:34.720 --> 33:40.640
reversible except the ligation part where you actually glue these at the backbone together

33:41.360 --> 33:48.160
and then we know from the ratio relationship between Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium

33:48.240 --> 33:54.880
constant here this is something you've learned in in college chemistry if you then know

33:56.080 --> 34:01.600
one of these either the forward or the backwards rate then you can actually and you know the the

34:01.600 --> 34:07.520
free energy associated with the hybridization then you can find the off rate and turns out the on

34:07.520 --> 34:13.760
rate is much faster than the off rate i mean much much faster and it doesn't depend much about it

34:13.760 --> 34:21.360
doesn't depend that much on the sequence details so if we for the sake of simplicity assume that

34:21.360 --> 34:30.880
it's constant then we can find the off rate by by sorry if we know this one and if we know the

34:30.880 --> 34:37.760
delta g and delta g is we've taken from santa lucía and hicks there they made this monumental

34:37.760 --> 34:44.000
work where they actually figured out how to calculate this free energy but also use there's a

34:44.000 --> 34:52.880
lot of online tools like a new pack that gives you gives you the the free energy and actually

34:52.880 --> 34:57.920
turns out that depending on what you're using you always get differences it's still there's still

34:57.920 --> 35:04.080
a little bit of of what's it called art and i don't think they've really nailed it down but

35:04.080 --> 35:11.680
anyways that's how we can we can figure out what the rate constants are by when we have the sequence

35:11.680 --> 35:21.680
then we can calculate the off rates so the results here are given to the left so we get

35:21.680 --> 35:29.760
replication rates and they're sort of all over the place in in this range here again this is the

35:29.760 --> 35:38.720
logarithm we are using and and what we have to compare here is when we do these experiments

35:40.320 --> 35:48.480
to do the ligation we need to have one of the ends energize with imidazole and that actually

35:49.360 --> 35:55.360
decays in water it falls apart in water so if you can't wait forever because else the system will

35:55.360 --> 36:02.880
simply die and the rate is i think the the place where they found the highest rate was about 10 to

36:02.880 --> 36:12.640
the minus 5 10 to the minus 5 per second so it's a relatively slow rate and we just we decide that

36:12.640 --> 36:18.720
we want to have a replication rate that it's at least one order of magnitude faster so we say

36:18.720 --> 36:26.560
that replication rate has to be higher than 10 to the minus 4 and that's here so we these guys are

36:26.560 --> 36:34.320
okay so there's a few of them that will be they'll be disqualified now to make simple to make things

36:34.320 --> 36:40.080
simple we've actually assumed that this happened and bought and not on a surface at an interface

36:40.080 --> 36:47.520
now we did do interface calculation then you have to adjust some of the rates and it turns out that

36:47.520 --> 36:52.720
it's at least an order of magnitude the collision rate is at least an order of magnitude faster

36:53.520 --> 36:58.800
if you do it on the surface but since there are many other reactions involved it's not

36:58.800 --> 37:04.800
that that big of a difference and this is assuming there's no crowding if you have too many molecules

37:04.800 --> 37:10.800
i actually don't know what happens if there's a crowding but we've also that's a whole other

37:10.800 --> 37:17.040
story we we've made we actually made a model we this is a sipping graph model where we can

37:17.040 --> 37:23.840
where we can take into account how it went when they collide on the surface how they actually

37:23.840 --> 37:30.160
also involved how depending on on this on what sequence details you have then sometimes you'll

37:30.160 --> 37:36.080
sliding and mismatches it takes a while for it to find the the the final situation so you can

37:36.080 --> 37:42.080
actually do the ligation but that's a different story but i think that it is true i believe

37:42.080 --> 37:53.120
that it is faster on the surface than it is in bulk so now we've done a study of charge transfer

37:53.120 --> 37:59.920
or charge transport on the dna we found out how fast or how slow we will allow the system to be

38:00.000 --> 38:06.400
and we've also done replication studies figure out you know of these 160 strands that we

38:07.200 --> 38:13.200
we have started which ones are fast enough etc so another question is of course how

38:14.720 --> 38:21.200
what does that mean for the for a protocell how do we combine these findings and that's the

38:23.840 --> 38:29.200
the last question namely try to figure out i mean how can the combined charge transport and

38:29.200 --> 38:38.720
replication process support a protocell life cycle so the first thing the easiest thing to do

38:38.720 --> 38:47.040
is to look at simply map these two our findings out on two different in a coordinate system

38:47.040 --> 38:54.000
where we have the the sorry the charge transfer rate on the the logarithm to the charge transfer

38:54.000 --> 39:03.520
rate on the x-axis and this is the logarithm of the of the replication rate constant on the y-axis

39:03.520 --> 39:12.400
and then we we had these as we had these requirements that we need to have the the this

39:12.400 --> 39:23.600
this charge transfer to be faster than than than 50 per second and the replication rate has to be

39:23.600 --> 39:30.000
faster than 10 to the minus 5 10 to the minus 4 per second so so we are good with replication in

39:30.000 --> 39:36.720
the blue area and we are good with with charge transfer in the reddish or light right red area

39:36.720 --> 39:43.120
and this area out here is then the sweet area this is where both things are are satisfied

39:44.160 --> 39:56.160
one thing i didn't discuss earlier is that for to have a good coupling between i mean for for

39:56.240 --> 40:03.040
selection and replication we we it's you you want to have your dna to replicate

40:06.320 --> 40:12.880
and not just be the resource pieces that can actually run the metabolism so if you think

40:12.880 --> 40:19.680
about if you have a an oxygrenine right next to the right next to the surface of the vesicle

40:19.680 --> 40:25.200
in one of the pieces one of the resource pieces you give the system then you don't need to have any

40:25.200 --> 40:30.640
replication to actually run the metabolism because the the the oxygrenine can communicate

40:30.640 --> 40:36.480
directly with the ruthenium complex you want to have the oxygrenine higher up so you need to have

40:36.480 --> 40:46.240
have a charge transfer in in in the duplex in in this pipe stacking that you have inside the

40:46.240 --> 40:53.840
dna what these what this charge transfer can happen so so all the the the round one the circles

40:53.840 --> 41:02.720
they have they have the um they have the oxygrenine above the ligation site i mean higher up on the

41:02.720 --> 41:09.200
dna away from from from the surface and all the triangles they have it very close to the surface

41:09.920 --> 41:17.600
so so in a way we we uh these are the fastest ones but we don't like them because it doesn't

41:17.600 --> 41:26.080
connect the two things very well but anyways it's it was kind of surprising to us that 63 out of these

41:26.080 --> 41:32.880
160 test the strands they actually satisfy these conditions so that's uh that means that we if we

41:32.880 --> 41:40.880
just make strands we should we should be possible for us to uh to actually make it work so the next

41:40.960 --> 41:47.600
i'm going to tell you is is i'm not sure how much um how relevant it is for for the experiments but

41:47.600 --> 41:56.480
i couldn't help doing it um and because you have you have the uh the these two mechanisms you have

41:56.480 --> 42:02.400
the replication and you have the charge transfer and is there a sort of a mathematical way to connect

42:02.400 --> 42:10.320
these two and it turns out that we a long time ago while i was still here still living here in in

42:10.320 --> 42:16.480
Santa Fe um we actually did a study it was a grad no it's actually a grad undergraduate his name

42:16.480 --> 42:23.120
is Tristan uh he did this here where we looked at a system where uh we have a single stranded

42:24.640 --> 42:31.200
a dna or a template and we have an we have oligomers you can then make duplexes um

42:32.000 --> 42:38.400
because they they uh they hybridize they are ligated and then they can uh separate against

42:38.400 --> 42:45.760
you have two single stranded uh dna and then you have precursor lipids i mean oily substance

42:45.760 --> 42:53.920
that that together with the duplex here um is able to to to make lipids so that's a these are sort of

42:53.920 --> 43:01.280
the much simplified much more simplified system um where we have separated we earlier you know

43:01.280 --> 43:06.080
previous work here earlier today we looked at this separately and this separately here we can

43:06.080 --> 43:15.040
solve these two things uh together and and it's not so simple because we have to look at uh you

43:15.040 --> 43:21.440
have to distinguish between the global concentration and the concentration of substances in these small

43:21.440 --> 43:28.400
protocells on the surfaces so you have the local concentration of the template um and then what is

43:28.400 --> 43:35.600
the volume of of the of the protocell container of the the surface and this is a number of of

43:35.600 --> 43:42.560
protocells you have in the system that gives you the global the global concentration of of your

43:43.120 --> 43:51.440
of your templates to give an example so it takes a little bit of of manipulation but you can get

43:52.000 --> 43:59.760
get these equations out one for the uh for the production of of templates and one for the production

43:59.760 --> 44:06.560
of the aggregates and in this you have a a replication rate and you have this metabolic rate

44:06.560 --> 44:13.200
which i mean the metabolic rate is includes this charge transfer and it turns out that these two

44:13.200 --> 44:19.840
equations if you if you divide this one with this one you get a Bernoulli equation that can

44:19.920 --> 44:26.960
actually be solved analytically and um you can then if you do that uh you can then get a doubling

44:26.960 --> 44:33.680
time expressed with all these things here and that means that you you actually if you look at it here

44:33.680 --> 44:41.600
you have a a doubling time then you have to switch it around the to the reciprocal uh expression

44:41.600 --> 44:49.920
so you get you get this k t squared and you have the uh the k sorry where is it and k l that's in

44:49.920 --> 44:58.320
in uh that's in the first order and then this will be uh uh to one-third so so this if you want to

44:58.320 --> 45:06.720
to uh to make a combined um fitness function or whatever you want to call it a gross rate function

45:07.520 --> 45:14.880
then it will the best guess that we could come up with is using what we know from from this system

45:14.880 --> 45:20.640
which is very similar although a simplification we will then have to multiply these two guys

45:21.440 --> 45:32.320
with different with broken with broken exponents so if we do that and then we order our

45:32.560 --> 45:41.360
uh our sequences again um where we we rank them from the worst to the best we get uh

45:41.920 --> 45:48.720
yeah well it's yeah some kind of theoretical fitness uh coefficient for for for the system here

45:51.520 --> 45:59.760
and you can see that it has it has the same shape as you can see here here they're sort of

45:59.760 --> 46:06.720
they're they're civil they're these three uh plateaus of three different regimes uh if you

46:06.720 --> 46:14.480
just go back here that's yeah so since i'm i can't follow some of the chemical details

46:15.280 --> 46:21.360
is is the is this your design process for coming up with these sequences or is this a fitness

46:21.360 --> 46:29.520
landscape that you're hoping these protocells cells mutate and and improve on so so so

46:29.920 --> 46:33.920
this is more this particular thing i was i was debating whether i wanted to

46:33.920 --> 46:39.200
you know include it or not because this is just for for i think this is more an intellectual

46:39.200 --> 46:45.520
exercise because we we believe that this is the shape of a fitness function but since we

46:46.080 --> 46:51.600
we've just taken these two constants there was many more constants or there are many more

46:51.600 --> 46:56.720
parameters involved in the other system but i think that that will be sort of the functional form

46:56.720 --> 47:03.920
um but you cannot make any quantitative uh assessments from from this uh to to the to the

47:03.920 --> 47:11.520
real system but but ultimately is this is this sort of consideration what you're using to design

47:11.520 --> 47:19.680
the best sequence or or are you hoping that the protocells will mutate and that the sequence of

47:19.680 --> 47:25.520
the highest metabolic rate will take the population so so so here from we already know

47:25.520 --> 47:31.680
which is uh which is a good uh uh charge transfer i mean you want to be up here because then you're

47:31.680 --> 47:38.400
both good at charge charge transfer and you're good at replication so so you want to uh experimentally

47:38.400 --> 47:44.960
want to you want to pick uh some of these sequences here and then uh once you've picked a sequence i

47:44.960 --> 47:49.920
mean just there'll be a big party if we get it to work i mean if the system can just replicate

47:50.000 --> 47:57.440
and and not die um then we can feed the system with the pieces of sequences that are better we

47:57.440 --> 48:04.400
our calculations predict are better and if that's indeed true then we'll see a takeover of this of

48:04.400 --> 48:10.320
the new co-factor and then there'll be another party so does that make sense

48:10.320 --> 48:23.440
let's say the the the evolution isn't taking place through mutation exactly no no no i did

48:23.440 --> 48:28.880
you you're feeding it like different oligomers yeah so so it can pick from different oligomers

48:28.880 --> 48:34.880
and the i mean these oligomers they'll form uh they'll form these duplexes that are then

48:34.880 --> 48:40.240
cofactors and the ones with a good co co-factor will uh i'll compete the other one yeah on the

48:40.240 --> 48:46.480
same topic you design the oligomers so that they have the imperfections yes you need to do that

48:46.480 --> 48:52.160
else we can't else we can't unless you so you play god you have to oh yeah with the imperfections

48:52.160 --> 48:56.720
yes because otherwise you don't get that that's right that's right yeah no no we we have to i mean

48:56.720 --> 49:02.400
in these are new imperfections because you break the molecule at the first imperfection right and

49:02.400 --> 49:07.520
then it's gonna anneal again at the same imperfection so you have to you have to create a new

49:07.520 --> 49:12.880
imperfection in what you're feeding with or no we just we just make sure that there are mismatches

49:12.880 --> 49:19.280
or there is a basis in the right places matches what's that that there's some mismatch yeah there

49:19.280 --> 49:25.120
has to be and and they can't well depending on where you put the mismatches it works well it

49:25.120 --> 49:31.920
doesn't work very well so so there is a number of details that that i i don't think well i can

49:31.920 --> 49:37.280
say one thing for sure that right at the ligation side that's where you have need to have a bulge

49:37.280 --> 49:43.680
or a an airbase because without doing that you you won't you you will not prevent

49:45.520 --> 49:52.800
what's it called product inhibition but but where you put the other mismatches depends on the rest

49:52.800 --> 50:00.160
of this of the sequence for instance if you have lots of AT's they're weak compared to GC's so then

50:00.240 --> 50:06.640
you if you have if you have sort of a GC heavy sequence you need to have more mismatches than

50:06.640 --> 50:14.880
if you have an AT heavy sequence and and the ultimate goal here is that so that you ensure

50:14.880 --> 50:24.000
growth of the lipid and the DNA and the little energy molecule at the first order rate kind of

50:24.000 --> 50:30.960
over time you you ensure that that's the goal yeah the goal is to just have the have all the pieces

50:30.960 --> 50:35.920
to play together no nobody has done that so far and that would be that'll be fantastic and then

50:35.920 --> 50:44.160
i think that if we can make that play in the lab then i think to actually see a see an evolutionary

50:44.160 --> 50:50.240
takeover will not be so hard i mean the difficult thing is to see whether this can actually work

50:50.240 --> 51:00.160
just want to show one more fun thing here so yeah i think this is theoretically interesting

51:00.160 --> 51:07.440
i don't think it helped us much too in the lab but here's another thing that this was

51:07.440 --> 51:13.200
Artemis he pointed out that it's actually interesting to to look at the functional

51:13.200 --> 51:18.000
information it's not easy to calculate the functional information in in real molecular

51:18.000 --> 51:26.320
systems but in this system it is easy because we we can we can this is a hasten hasten's paper

51:26.320 --> 51:32.960
we used or his idea i guess it's from a show stack originally but anyways we can we can calculate

51:34.320 --> 51:39.120
the probability that we have a strand if you pick a strand at random from these

51:40.000 --> 51:46.400
what is it hundred and and 60 strands i get yeah you know it's 160 strand so what is the chance that

51:47.280 --> 51:53.280
it satisfies this condition divided by the total number of strands that gives you the

51:53.280 --> 51:58.080
probability that you pick a strand that's good enough for a charge transfer you can do the same

51:58.080 --> 52:05.200
for replication and you can ask for both of them to be fulfilled and then you have the probability

52:05.200 --> 52:12.320
for that and then we can calculate the computation the compositional functional information by

52:13.280 --> 52:21.280
taking the the logarithm minus the logarithm and then simply calculates these and then

52:22.000 --> 52:25.840
we'll get these results out and if you look at it here

52:32.400 --> 52:40.160
we have calculated the oh yeah so this is a functional information from for the charge transfer

52:40.160 --> 52:47.120
process where we have again ranked them so we've said the bad ones first and they get better and

52:47.120 --> 52:56.400
better and better and better and they will then level out up here at about 2.32 bits because

52:56.400 --> 53:02.160
we have 32 strands that have identical charge transfer rates so that's why it stops there

53:02.880 --> 53:08.480
it's a little bit different over here for the replication but if you do the calculation you get

53:08.880 --> 53:16.720
just one point 34 bits for for of information is necessary to ensure

53:16.720 --> 53:22.480
growths about self-sustaining so it's not very much information but again there were 63 strands

53:22.480 --> 53:30.880
out of these 160 that satisfied our our goal so i'm sorry yeah experimental what this plots

53:31.680 --> 53:38.000
they will stay cases you got this howl from experimental no no no this is this is from

53:38.000 --> 53:46.560
by taking by ranking um uh by by simply calculating the this is the the functional

53:46.560 --> 53:55.760
information here by by calculating the functional information uh then then you you'll have as you

53:55.760 --> 54:03.120
go through the strands then as you get better and better strands uh there'll be fewer you have

54:03.120 --> 54:09.680
to be more and more lucky to pick the right strands and if then rank order them you get a staircase

54:09.680 --> 54:17.760
like that does that make sense what do you what do you say yes going back to chris's question

54:17.760 --> 54:24.080
if you did this as a full population explicit evolutionary situation you'd say the strands

54:24.160 --> 54:29.440
that survived only gained 1.34 bits over the strands that didn't survive everything

54:29.440 --> 54:35.840
sort of like the information dealt yes yes yes yes but but there will be but there will be a

54:35.840 --> 54:40.320
even though you just make it over the threshold then there'll be some that are better than just

54:40.320 --> 54:46.160
doing the threshold so so you can then calculate what that is i mean this is the threshold for

54:46.720 --> 54:54.480
for for these 50 per second for the for the charge transfer and and this is the one for the

54:54.480 --> 55:04.000
replication over here so are you maybe we can talk about it afterwards how we how we do this

55:04.000 --> 55:12.560
but it is it's it's really not it's very simple you just you just take the you just rank order

55:13.040 --> 55:18.880
um how much information there is as you improve as you improve the strands

55:21.040 --> 55:26.960
and and so this is the best ones they are the ones that are fastest here okay so

55:29.040 --> 55:39.760
so hypothetically what we want is to set up a chemostat where we put in resources and then

55:39.760 --> 55:46.640
we have a certain outflow rate and so this is the inflow rate this is the outflow rate

55:47.440 --> 55:54.000
and we have to know the hydrolysis of all these processes or all the the products or the the

55:54.000 --> 56:02.320
i'm sorry the the input and and and these are then the fitness rank cofactors and and this is

56:02.320 --> 56:08.160
where we've used we can think about it from from what we calculated earlier and these are the

56:08.160 --> 56:15.840
resources these are the different types of oligomers in the system as well as as a picolinium

56:15.840 --> 56:23.520
ester and we have to have this proton donor etc etc and we then get i mean you are probably

56:23.520 --> 56:33.760
familiar with these with these chemostat equations and you then get if you look at the biomass we

56:33.760 --> 56:41.120
then get a transition for life where these where this is fulfilled and and i think what's interesting

56:41.120 --> 56:48.800
is that it's extremely important it's not just the um the the what's it called the gross factors

56:48.800 --> 56:56.320
or the fitness function you you have to look at what the degradation rates and then as you can

56:56.320 --> 57:02.800
see the rest of it is actually environmental parameters which are really important and then

57:02.800 --> 57:10.800
to end up here we have a so that's i guess our perspective on on what what's going on

57:10.800 --> 57:18.240
where we have a if this is again lined up where we take the strands the cofactor with higher and

57:18.240 --> 57:26.560
higher fitness so so once you are below this self-maintaining threshold you will be flushed out by

57:26.560 --> 57:35.280
the chemostat but if once you're above it then you'll actually have a biomass existing in terms of

57:35.280 --> 57:41.760
protocells and if you just pick these strands at random and provide them then it'll probably be

57:42.640 --> 57:49.920
you know a discontinuous there'll be discontinuous jumps if you if you put them in sort of one

57:49.920 --> 57:53.600
after the other with the one is a little bit better then it'll be approached or it'll be

57:53.600 --> 57:59.760
approximated with that with a continuous curve so you know i know that the literature people talk

57:59.760 --> 58:07.520
about whether you can view the transition to life as a first or a second order phase transition in

58:07.520 --> 58:13.680
biomass and i think you can you can you can do both here and also the the same will be true this is

58:13.680 --> 58:22.720
our it's just a symbolic representation of the functional information here and yeah this is where

58:22.720 --> 58:30.320
once once you actually have a cofactor that's able to support this protocell life cycle then

58:30.320 --> 58:37.840
you have the possibility of starting to to select information or store and select information

58:37.840 --> 58:47.360
once the co cofactor doesn't provide you fast enough metabolism and fast enough replication

58:47.360 --> 58:50.560
then the system will just be flushed out

58:56.880 --> 59:03.840
so so what did we get out of this study i mean i i was you know you go in there and you don't know

59:03.840 --> 59:08.320
what well i didn't know anything about charge transfer my my graduate student denied us so we

59:08.320 --> 59:15.200
had to we had to take a crash course and that and and many people are real specialists they all said

59:15.200 --> 59:20.320
oh we have to do quantum calculations of initial calculation but if we did that you know we'd have

59:20.320 --> 59:27.840
to occupy one of the big machines for for weeks for for making a calculation of a single duplex

59:27.840 --> 59:33.760
and we wanted to have an ensemble to figure out you know what what what the differences were so

59:33.760 --> 59:41.120
that was why we we did this this differential equation approach instead but the most important

59:41.120 --> 59:49.120
thing is that we can't really reject that this will work i mean along the way when we've

59:50.160 --> 59:54.720
tried to implement this a living system in the lab from time to time we've

59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.320
has either been impossible experimentally or we've figured out that we hadn't thought about

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:07.440
enough and theoretically we we made a boo boo but here it seems like 30 or 63 of them are actually

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:14.080
okay and then there are some assumptions that i think is important we have assumed that we have

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:21.520
super exchange uh across the bulge across this uh ligation site we couldn't figure out whether

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.760
this is indeed true or not uh we couldn't find any literature on it we did assume that it is possible

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:33.920
if it is not possible then we need to use uh we need to put our oxygen in just below the

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.880
ligation side so that you need to still have a hybridization you need to have a duplex

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:45.760
for for having the charge transferred to to actually work and another important

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.120
approximation is that we don't have any interactions between the charge transport and the

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:57.840
replication dynamics or the environment so we are sort of using a super a simple superposition

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.960
of the two and of course a more comprehensive simulation that's much more complicated would

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.360
take all these things into consideration but we didn't dare to venture into that

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.000
so so i think these are the two most important uh sort of simplifications and and then of course

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.200
the main issue here is to hopefully convince a sponsor that we can we can test this in the lab

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.040
thank you

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.040
questions

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:43.840
else i'll be around until uh May 8th so we can talk if you have questions
