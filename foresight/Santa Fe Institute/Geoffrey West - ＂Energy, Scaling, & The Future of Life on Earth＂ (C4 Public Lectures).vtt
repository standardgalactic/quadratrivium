WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
I'm Jessica Flack and I'm the co-director of the Center for Complexity and Collective

00:05.240 --> 00:07.800
Computation in the WID.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.840
And before I introduce tonight's topic and speakers, special guests, I would like to

00:12.840 --> 00:16.160
first thank some of the folks in WID who made tonight happen.

00:16.160 --> 00:22.800
Maria Piat, Marianne Englisch, Jenny Eagleton, Sarah Shapiro, and Beth Misko, WID's outstanding

00:22.800 --> 00:25.440
administrative and outreach team.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.600
I'd also like to thank Wisconsin Public Television, who's in the back filming the lectures

00:29.600 --> 00:36.360
tonight, everybody at University Communications, who's done a great job with advertising, folks

00:36.360 --> 00:42.280
at the ITHMIS for accommodating changes the last minute, and of course the IT team and

00:42.280 --> 00:46.160
Alan Ruby in particular here in WID for their support tonight.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.760
And finally, the Center for Complexity and Collective Computation is indebted to John

00:49.760 --> 00:56.160
Wiley and to the Templeton Foundation for very much appreciated financial support of

00:56.160 --> 00:58.260
tonight's lecture series.

00:58.260 --> 01:01.900
Without this support, we could not have these kinds of events.

01:01.900 --> 01:05.620
So tonight's lecture on the roles of energy and information in 21st century biology is

01:05.620 --> 01:10.620
part of a new public lecture series sponsored by C4, that's the Center for Complexity and

01:10.620 --> 01:14.900
Collective Computation, and the series is called the John von Neumann Public Lectures

01:14.900 --> 01:16.940
in Complexity and Computation.

01:16.940 --> 01:22.380
And the lectures are going to be each month at about 7 p.m. the 2nd or 3rd Wednesday over

01:22.380 --> 01:26.920
the course of the fall and spring semesters in 2012 and 2013.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.000
We have a great lineup this fall.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.280
The next speaker, the next lecture is on October 17th, and it's by Graham Spencer, who you

01:35.280 --> 01:41.400
might know as one of the original founders of Excite, and he's currently a partner at

01:41.400 --> 01:46.160
Google Ventures, and he's going to be talking about programming the Internet.

01:46.160 --> 01:50.360
He's a super smart, broad-minded computer scientist who gives fun and insightful lectures,

01:50.360 --> 01:52.960
so I hope to see you guys all there.

01:52.960 --> 01:57.440
Intelligent information are two of the most fundamental concepts in science, affecting

01:57.440 --> 02:02.600
phenomena over a vast range of scales, from quantum mechanics to the origin of life to

02:02.600 --> 02:08.840
the evolution of cooperation in human and animal societies, to also, as you'll hear

02:08.840 --> 02:11.760
about tonight, the size and pace of cities.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.280
In tonight's lecture, Dr. Jeffrey West and Dr. David Krakauer, who I will introduce

02:15.280 --> 02:19.680
momentarily, will explore how information and energy have shaped nature, and they'll

02:19.680 --> 02:25.040
discuss the implications of the principles for the future of science, for future of biology,

02:25.040 --> 02:27.880
and for society.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.720
Some of the questions that we will tackle over the course of the evening tonight include

02:31.720 --> 02:34.920
what really are energy and information.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.840
The laws of physics, and specifically the first law of thermodynamics, tells us that

02:38.840 --> 02:42.080
energy cannot be created or destroyed.

02:42.080 --> 02:48.800
As such, it's said to be a conserved quantity, meaning that the total energy in the universe

02:48.800 --> 02:51.240
is a constant.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.240
It is this property of energy coupled to the fact that it can be hard to transform into

02:55.240 --> 02:59.960
something useful that makes it seem like a finite expendable resource.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.280
Now is the same true for information?

03:02.280 --> 03:04.920
Or can information be created and destroyed?

03:04.920 --> 03:07.360
And if so, what does this mean?

03:07.360 --> 03:11.800
So as you'll hear tonight, existing theories of information stress that information increases

03:11.800 --> 03:14.560
our understanding of the world around us.

03:14.560 --> 03:21.640
In formal terms, we say that information reduces the uncertainty about the environment.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.760
But there's nothing in this definition that captures, I think, the fact that most of us,

03:25.760 --> 03:29.560
for most of us in this audience, information is really about meaning.

03:29.560 --> 03:33.280
It's the knowledge itself not about reducing uncertainty about the knowledge that we're

03:33.280 --> 03:34.920
interested in.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.960
So existing formal theories of information have nothing to say about this which you might

03:37.960 --> 03:38.960
call semantics.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.320
Do we need a new theory of information?

03:42.320 --> 03:43.960
That includes meaning or semantics.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.720
That's one of the questions we'll ask tonight.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.400
Can we use existing formal theories of information?

03:50.400 --> 03:54.760
Or are the new ones that we might build to overcome energetic constraints?

03:54.760 --> 04:00.160
Or does information only help us find solutions to harness energy more efficiently?

04:00.160 --> 04:04.360
These are deep and unanswered questions in physics and biology.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.360
So finally, we are going to ask what would a new science of energy and information mean

04:09.360 --> 04:13.720
for physics, for computer science, for biology, and for society?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.760
So our first speaker is Dr. Jeffrey West.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.720
Jeffrey is a theoretical physicist whose primary interests have been in fundamental questions

04:19.720 --> 04:24.480
in physics, especially those concerning the elementary particles, their interactions

04:24.480 --> 04:27.720
and cosmological implications.

04:27.720 --> 04:33.520
Jeffrey received his BA from Cambridge in 1961, his doctorate from Stanford in 1966,

04:33.520 --> 04:36.840
where he returned in 1970 as a member of the faculty.

04:36.840 --> 04:42.560
He was the leader and founder of the high-energy physics group at Los Alamos National Labs.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.800
Then he moved to the Santa Fe Institute in 2003, where he became a distinguished member

04:45.800 --> 04:53.160
of the faculty and eventually became president of SFI for 2005 to 2009.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.480
His long-term fascination has been in the origin of universal scaling laws that pervade

04:57.480 --> 05:02.040
biology from the molecular genomic scale up through a minor country and sells to whole

05:02.040 --> 05:04.360
organisms and ecosystems.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.640
He's currently working to extend the theory of scaling that was developed in biology,

05:07.640 --> 05:12.080
or as it was developed in biology, to social systems with the goal of understanding the

05:12.080 --> 05:17.280
structure and dynamic of social organizations, such as cities and corporations.

05:17.280 --> 05:22.600
Tonight, he will talk on energy scaling and the future of life on Earth for about 45

05:22.600 --> 05:23.760
minutes.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.360
Our second lecture is David Krakauer.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.280
David is the director of the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, co-director of the Center for

05:30.280 --> 05:34.960
Complexity and Collective Computation, professor of genetics at UW-Madison and external professor

05:34.960 --> 05:37.200
at the Santa Fe Institute.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.800
A graduate of University London and Oxford University has authored more than a hundred

05:40.800 --> 05:45.040
scientific papers, served on several journal editorial boards, and works to bridge the

05:45.040 --> 05:49.920
gap between academia and business, and also between the physical and biological sciences

05:49.920 --> 05:54.520
on the one hand and the social sciences and humanities on the other.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.880
His research focuses on the evolutionary history of information processing mechanisms

05:58.880 --> 06:01.280
in adaptive systems.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.920
But his mind, and I know him well, is perhaps best described as sitting in an intellectual

06:05.920 --> 06:09.960
space that has been deeply influenced by, I guess, I think a somewhat idiosyncratic

06:09.960 --> 06:15.800
group of some of history's most interesting contributors, including John Louis Borges,

06:15.800 --> 06:19.720
John von Neumann, Turing, Bill Hamilton, and Sir Thomas Brown.

06:19.720 --> 06:24.240
Tonight he will talk for 30 minutes on the power of information to transform the 21st

06:24.240 --> 06:26.000
century.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.040
Following the lectures of David and Jeffrey, Steve Paulson from Wisconsin Public Radio

06:30.040 --> 06:35.080
will lead a panel discussion on the role of energy and information in 21st century biology.

06:35.080 --> 06:39.000
Steve is the executive producer and interviewer with, to the best of our knowledge, a well

06:39.000 --> 06:41.040
known science radio program.

06:41.040 --> 06:47.080
Paulson is written for Salon, Slate, The Huffington Post, The Chronicle of Higher Education,

06:47.080 --> 06:49.800
The Independent, and many other publications.

06:49.800 --> 06:55.200
His radio reports have also been broadcast on NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.320
His recent book, Adams and Eden, Conversations on Religion and Science, was published back

06:59.320 --> 07:01.520
for the University Press.

07:01.560 --> 07:06.080
So please join me for a bit of a marathon session and welcome Steve, David, and Jeffrey.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.080
Thank you.

07:31.520 --> 07:37.080
Thank you, David, thank you, Jessica, and thank you for inviting me to give this talk

07:37.080 --> 07:45.040
and be part of this interesting discussion about energy and information.

07:45.040 --> 07:54.880
So this is the title that was given to me, mostly because I was delinquent in giving

07:54.880 --> 07:57.840
one myself.

07:57.840 --> 08:03.480
And it does sort of cover what I'm going to talk about, but this is kind of the landscape

08:03.480 --> 08:10.480
that I'm going to be talking about tonight in terms primarily of energy and the ideas

08:10.480 --> 08:17.440
surrounding metabolism in biology, and it's a very idiosyncratic view, and as is clear

08:17.440 --> 08:24.120
from the introduction, I come to it as a theoretical physicist wandering into areas of biology

08:24.120 --> 08:26.480
and the social sciences.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.160
And I'm going to begin it.

08:28.160 --> 08:33.960
I'm going to take as a point of departure something that's relevant to this, namely,

08:33.960 --> 08:40.720
this is supported by the Center for Computation and Complexity, or whatever anyway.

08:40.720 --> 08:49.200
Complexity was in it, and I wanted to use as a point of departure a statement by Stephen

08:49.200 --> 08:54.080
Hawking, who is not someone that works on complexity and not someone that works on biology, but

08:54.080 --> 09:01.640
is a highly reductionistic physicist, and here's something he said about 10 years ago.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.960
Some say that while the 20th century was the century of physics, we are now entering the

09:04.960 --> 09:06.360
century of biology.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.840
What do you think of this?

09:07.840 --> 09:12.160
And many people believe the 21st century is the century of biology, and it certainly will

09:12.160 --> 09:17.440
be, but more importantly, and this I do believe is what Hawking says, I think the next century

09:17.440 --> 09:21.560
will be the century of complexity, because many of the problems we're going to face

09:21.560 --> 09:26.880
and are facing are to do with complex adaptive systems, and I'll be talking a little bit

09:26.880 --> 09:28.040
about them.

09:28.040 --> 09:33.680
And I want to use this, as I say, as a point of departure because implicit in this is an

09:33.680 --> 09:40.160
idea of what complexity is, and that's something I'm not going to discuss, but accept to use

09:40.160 --> 09:46.920
it to talk about what is not complex first, because it brings in the whole role of energy.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.360
And this is a system we're familiar with, the solar system, and this is a system that

09:51.360 --> 09:54.040
is often thought of as not complex.

09:54.040 --> 10:03.160
It is simple, and by simple it means that the whole dynamics of that system, the motion

10:03.160 --> 10:08.400
of the planets around the sun and therefore of the satellites that power our communication

10:08.400 --> 10:14.120
systems, are all encoded in two very simple looking equations.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.560
This is a highly non-technical talk, you don't have to understand the equations, everybody

10:18.560 --> 10:24.480
is familiar with the idea F equals MA, but they're in the two laws proposed by Newton

10:24.480 --> 10:28.880
that kind of covers everything to do with the motion of the solar system, the planets

10:28.880 --> 10:34.680
around the sun, but much, much else, and much of modern physics is based on these equations

10:34.680 --> 10:40.200
or versions of these equations, but critical in this is the flow of energy, the idea that

10:40.200 --> 10:46.960
energy is the kind of fundamental thing that's underlying this motion, and one of the crucial

10:46.960 --> 10:51.440
aspects of that is already been mentioned by Jessica, the conservation of energy.

10:51.440 --> 10:55.920
But if you add to it another set of equations, which you don't have to understand, but important

10:55.920 --> 11:01.440
to understand conceptually the equations of Maxwell for unifying electricity and magnetism

11:01.440 --> 11:06.960
and giving rise to understanding radiation, electromagnetic radiation, that pretty much

11:06.960 --> 11:13.080
encompasses much of the kind of world that we live in, and indeed, just to take these

11:13.080 --> 11:18.360
two equations with these equations is how your cell phone works and allows everybody

11:18.360 --> 11:23.680
to communicate and everything else that's pretty much around us, and these, the word

11:23.680 --> 11:30.360
simple applies to because they invoke the idea that you can encode everything in this symbolic

11:30.360 --> 11:36.480
fashion and from that everything else follows, even down to the quantum level, and one of

11:36.480 --> 11:41.640
the things I want to emphasize is that again, these are to do with the flow of energy and

11:41.640 --> 11:47.160
because they are simple and they are written in a mathematically precise form, you can

11:47.160 --> 11:52.080
calculate things somehow in principle to any degree of accuracy, and one of the great

11:52.080 --> 11:58.960
triumphs of 20th century science is this calculation, which is calculating the strength

11:58.960 --> 12:04.560
of the magnet associated with the electron, and here's the theory to 12 decimal places,

12:04.560 --> 12:07.920
and here's the experiment agreeing with it to 12 decimal places.

12:07.920 --> 12:13.760
This is kind of extraordinary, and this is quite unusual actually in the world that we

12:13.760 --> 12:20.480
live in, because the world that we live in, oh, I forgot about that, I put this slide

12:20.480 --> 12:26.040
in, just to show you some of the main characters that you're familiar with that have, that

12:26.040 --> 12:30.080
I think have played an important role in developing ideas of energy.

12:30.080 --> 12:35.120
One is this, is Newton, that's the kind of rock star image of Newton.

12:35.120 --> 12:40.440
This is Einstein looking like Einstein, and this is Max Planck, the origin of photons

12:40.440 --> 12:50.520
and the quantum, and this is someone, oops, this is someone that most people are not familiar

12:50.520 --> 12:57.520
with, it's another, there was a famous Bill Hamilton here, biologist, very famous ecologist,

12:57.520 --> 13:01.640
biologist, the David or Jessica actually mentioned.

13:01.640 --> 13:09.520
This is a really deep Bill Hamilton, this is Bill Hamilton, he was an Irishman who I

13:09.520 --> 13:16.560
sadly drank himself to death, but he encoded something extremely important about energy,

13:16.560 --> 13:21.200
and the physicists in the audience will forgive me, but basically he said that all physical

13:21.200 --> 13:27.560
systems in some sense minimize the amount of energy that needs to be expended.

13:27.560 --> 13:33.000
So this kind of a least, minimum least energy principle, Hamilton's principle, it's actually

13:33.000 --> 13:38.440
called technically the principle of least action, but roughly speaking this is the framework

13:38.440 --> 13:45.440
in which all of the physics that encompasses everything from the macroscopic down to string

13:45.440 --> 13:52.400
theory operates from, is using those principles, and it's to do based on energy.

13:52.400 --> 13:58.200
So here's a picture of energy, this is energy, we're familiar with it, and this is highly

13:58.200 --> 14:02.600
complex use of energy because these are highly non-linear effects and you're familiar with

14:02.600 --> 14:09.640
them, you're also familiar with this, this is the energy that we create on the planet

14:09.640 --> 14:16.080
through objects like this, cities, and I'm going to talk a little bit about that shortly,

14:16.080 --> 14:23.280
and these are driven of course by us, which involve energy, so there are these multiple

14:23.280 --> 14:33.160
levels of energy, and they go all the way down to the thing that drives these us, that

14:33.160 --> 14:40.720
drives us to create the light and the energy by which we live, our brains and our cells,

14:40.720 --> 14:47.360
and these of course also operate by energy themselves, but they invoke something new

14:47.360 --> 14:53.360
that is typically not been considered in physics, and they invoke information, the idea that

14:53.360 --> 15:00.960
information necessarily is needed to be put into the system in order to understand the

15:00.960 --> 15:05.840
way these systems have evolved and the way they organize and the way they behave, and

15:05.840 --> 15:11.520
these systems are typically outside physics, and they form much of the work of biology

15:11.520 --> 15:19.440
and the social sciences, and they are complex, but more importantly they evolve and are therefore

15:19.440 --> 15:25.800
adaptive, so these are very different in their nature from the kind of simplistic system that

15:25.880 --> 15:32.640
we see in the motions of the planets, or even may I say in thinking about string theory

15:32.640 --> 15:37.600
as the origins of the universe, because we can write definitive, precise equations in

15:37.600 --> 15:44.280
principle for those, whereas for these we have this extraordinary challenging problem

15:44.280 --> 15:50.120
of both integrating information in it and understanding the role of energy, and what

15:50.120 --> 15:56.320
I'm going to explore tonight is how far one can take the traditional physics thinking

15:56.320 --> 16:04.480
without invoking explicitly information to understand some of the organization and dynamics

16:04.480 --> 16:09.560
of these systems, and then David will talk about information and maybe in the discussion

16:09.560 --> 16:13.880
we'll talk a little bit about the integration. So here's another kind of system that you're

16:13.880 --> 16:20.360
familiar with, a forest, and all of these systems obey second law of thermodynamics and

16:20.360 --> 16:25.680
the conservation of energy, and therefore the production of entropy, which is the kind

16:25.680 --> 16:33.120
of random stuff, the dissipative kind of energy that comes from doing work and creating order,

16:33.120 --> 16:39.560
it is the resulting disorder that comes from ordering the system, and one of the challenges

16:39.640 --> 16:45.760
and I would say, I would even go as far as to say, I think the major challenge conceptually

16:45.760 --> 16:51.280
in 21st century science is understanding this integration between energy and resources on

16:51.280 --> 16:58.680
the one hand, metabolism in biology with information, genomics maybe, and integrate and get a complete

16:58.680 --> 17:05.440
understanding of these. These are typically considered separately, roughly speaking, in

17:06.040 --> 17:13.360
the kind of academic way in which we think about these things. So what I'm going to talk

17:13.360 --> 17:20.600
about in these systems is, as a physicist, I want a quantitative, predictive, mathematical

17:20.600 --> 17:25.920
in principle understanding of the dynamics and organization of these systems, and it

17:25.920 --> 17:32.000
is clear for the kinds of systems I just referred to, we cannot do what we did for understanding

17:32.000 --> 17:37.080
the magnetic moment of the electron. We're not going to get equations that produce precise

17:37.080 --> 17:46.080
calculations, but maybe what we can get is what we call coarse grain descriptions. So

17:46.080 --> 17:51.720
for example, the kinds of questions that we ought to be able to answer quantitatively

17:51.720 --> 17:56.480
are questions like this. Why is it that I can look across this room and say, everybody

17:56.480 --> 18:05.160
will be dead in 100 years? In fact, if I look more closely, I would say that, including

18:05.160 --> 18:12.160
myself, may I say, but where does 100 years come from for a typical lifespan of a human

18:12.160 --> 18:19.440
being? Why isn't it 10 years or 1,000 years? And how is that connected to underlying molecular

18:19.440 --> 18:22.920
structures of the genome and the respiratory complex? Where in the hell does that come

18:22.960 --> 18:28.800
from? And why is it that the same stuff, if it were a mouse, only lives two or three

18:28.800 --> 18:35.160
years? So those are the kinds of coarse-grained questions that one ought to be able to answer

18:35.160 --> 18:42.240
in a predictive framework, and I'm not going to talk much about these, but in what role

18:42.240 --> 18:47.080
does energy and metabolism play in these? So here's another set of similar kinds of

18:47.080 --> 18:51.720
coarse-grained questions. Why do we need eight hours of sleep? Why do we need to sleep? Why

18:51.840 --> 18:58.040
are not two hours or 18 hours like a mouse or four hours like an elephant? Where in the

18:58.040 --> 19:04.280
hell do these numbers come from? And why is it that mice get many more tumors during their

19:04.280 --> 19:10.200
lifespan per unit volume than human beings? And therefore, why in the hell are we doing

19:10.200 --> 19:15.360
all these experiments on mice and trying to draw conclusions about human beings? We need

19:15.360 --> 19:20.960
to understand those kinds of questions. And the one I really love is why is it very good

19:21.040 --> 19:26.240
to grow babies in your body but not grow cancer, which is also part of you? So these are kind

19:26.240 --> 19:31.640
of coarse-grained questions. And one that has occupied me in the last few years is are citizen

19:31.640 --> 19:39.640
companies just large organisms that are biological? Are citizen organisms just, is New York a great

19:39.640 --> 19:46.960
big whale? And Google a great big elephant? And if that's true, how come that organisms

19:47.040 --> 19:56.040
die? Companies die but cities don't. And in fact, I would say, roughly speaking, almost

19:56.040 --> 20:01.520
no cities die, although you can think of counter examples. We have done awful experiments to

20:01.520 --> 20:07.520
test that. We've dropped two atom bombs on two cities and 30 years later they're functioning.

20:07.520 --> 20:14.120
Companies, all companies die. And so one of the questions is in a coarse-grained way, can

20:14.160 --> 20:20.160
we predict when Google and Microsoft are going to go bust? Because they surely will eventually.

20:20.160 --> 20:24.480
Okay, so those are the kinds of questions. And I want to lead into all of this. This is

20:24.480 --> 20:31.480
biology, but I want to lead into it via cities because we are facing an extraordinary challenge

20:32.480 --> 20:38.320
and this is addressing the question of how biological are cities and can we understand

20:38.320 --> 20:43.920
them that way? We are facing this extraordinary challenge that we live in this exponentially

20:43.920 --> 20:49.480
expanding universe of socioeconomic quantities. And just to give you an example, we've gone

20:49.480 --> 20:54.640
from a few percent being urban to over 80 percent being urban in just 200 years. The

20:54.640 --> 20:59.960
world's across the halfway mark. We're going to go to somewhere close to 80 percent by

20:59.960 --> 21:06.800
2050. China's building several hundred new cities in the next 20 to 30 years. And indeed,

21:06.800 --> 21:12.800
this statistic ought to freak everybody out that every week from now to 2050 on the average

21:12.840 --> 21:17.240
one and a half million people are being urbanized. Therefore, every two months, there's a New

21:17.240 --> 21:22.240
York metropolitan area coming onto this planet. So by the beginning of December, there's another

21:22.240 --> 21:27.440
New York metropolitan area. By the beginning of February, there's another one. By the beginning

21:27.440 --> 21:34.440
of April, there's another one and so on inextricably for the next 30, 40 years. Now, can I use

21:35.720 --> 21:37.240
explosives in this talk?

21:37.240 --> 21:38.240
Sure.

21:38.240 --> 21:43.760
Okay. How in the f*** are we going to deal with that? This is an extraordinary challenge.

21:43.760 --> 21:50.760
So I want to get into that and it is related to energy. Okay. So the other aspect to recognize

21:52.120 --> 21:57.360
is that all of the tsunami of problems we're facing from global warming to the environment

21:57.360 --> 22:04.360
to health problems to crime to resource problems, water, energy and so on, all are driven by

22:05.360 --> 22:11.360
urbanization by people in cities. So that's the problem. But cities are also the solution

22:11.360 --> 22:18.360
because they suck all of you lot into Madison. Cities suck in people and they are the sources

22:18.360 --> 22:25.360
of ideas, innovation and wealth creation. So this is what cities are represented by,

22:26.360 --> 22:32.360
the good of cities. This is what in fact attracts people to cities, all these good things, culture,

22:33.360 --> 22:40.360
music, goods and so on, driven and participating in an ever expanding, exponential, expanding

22:41.080 --> 22:48.080
economy. But if this is a thermodynamic system, which it is, it produces entropy. So it produces

22:49.800 --> 22:56.800
socioeconomic entropy. Incidentally, side comment, if you look in any of the standard

22:57.800 --> 23:04.800
economics books, you never see the word entropy. But what is more amazing is, we've looked

23:06.080 --> 23:13.080
in five of the standard texts, only in one did the word energy appear. That's a side

23:13.600 --> 23:20.600
comment, provocative comment. So here's socioeconomic entropy. Okay. You're familiar with all this.

23:21.600 --> 23:26.600
And the question is, is that what New York and San Francisco and it looked like in 2050

23:26.600 --> 23:33.600
or that, or like this, or this? This is what we want, or even like that, beautiful, or

23:35.400 --> 23:41.760
like that in a hundred years or that. And most importantly, to maintain that, which

23:41.760 --> 23:48.520
is the social buzz of a city, the interaction of people. So here's the question, given this

23:48.560 --> 23:55.560
extraordinary role of cities, we need a science of cities. Okay. And I'm going to use energy

23:55.960 --> 24:01.720
as the as a major piece of that. So the question is, can we have a science of that? And is

24:01.720 --> 24:07.760
that another version of this? Well, if it is, that would be good, actually. If this were

24:07.760 --> 24:14.760
another version of that, because you ask any question that has a quantitative metric associated

24:15.240 --> 24:19.680
with it, like, how many trees are there of a given size? How many leaves are there in

24:19.680 --> 24:25.000
a given branch of a given size? How much energy is flowing through each one? How many, how

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
big is the canopy? What is the mortality rate? What is the growth rate? How, how far apart

24:31.000 --> 24:36.880
the trees have given size, etc. All those can be answered in a quantitative conceptual

24:36.880 --> 24:42.800
framework with a bunch of mathematical formulae, which in a coarse grained way, agrees with

24:42.840 --> 24:48.000
data from forests all across the globe. And the question is, can we do the same for this?

24:48.000 --> 24:55.000
Sorry, we'll submit to go backwards. So we're here, some of the commonalities, metaphorically,

24:56.160 --> 25:02.520
at least, between social organizations and biological organisms, which we're all familiar

25:02.520 --> 25:09.520
with. And I'm going to show you some just very briefly some data that substantiates

25:10.280 --> 25:16.720
the idea that we understand a little bit about, generically, the way forests work. So what

25:16.720 --> 25:22.080
this is, is just a plot of the number of trees of a given size. The theory, which I'm going

25:22.080 --> 25:27.320
to talk about momentarily, the theory predicts that it goes as the inverse square of the

25:27.320 --> 25:30.920
diameter of the tree trunks. The number of trees of a given size goes as the inverse

25:30.920 --> 25:34.640
square of the diameter of the tree trunks, which means if you look at trees that are

25:34.640 --> 25:39.200
twice the size of any others, there's a quarter of the number, two squared, a quarter of the

25:39.200 --> 25:45.000
number, if it were three times, it'd be eighth and so on. So you get the idea. And there's

25:45.000 --> 25:49.680
data. And what is important about it, not only does the data fit the theory, but you

25:49.680 --> 25:56.680
can see it's over a period of 30, 40 years, this forest, which is a tropical forest, has

25:56.920 --> 26:03.680
changed dramatically. Lots of trees have died, new ones have grown, rapid turnover. But this

26:03.680 --> 26:10.680
law has remained robust. And there's data into the 90s and 2000s that continue with

26:12.360 --> 26:18.480
that. I'm going to miss this. So here's the kind of framework that I want to invoke. Here's

26:18.480 --> 26:24.280
a cartoon of, say, an ecosystem. I could have done a city. And this is the lens that I want

26:24.280 --> 26:29.840
to look at it through. And all of these equations actually are really to do with energy flow.

26:30.840 --> 26:35.960
So another concept I want to talk about very briefly is the concept of scalability that

26:35.960 --> 26:42.960
a system needs to be scalable if it is a system that is going to be resilient and evolvable

26:43.880 --> 26:50.160
and adaptive to change. It needs to be scalable just in the sense that we are scalable. This

26:50.160 --> 26:57.160
is us. We have scaled over a range of 100 million in size in mass. We go down to something

26:59.920 --> 27:04.760
that sits on the palm of my hand all the way up to something that's bigger than this, much

27:04.760 --> 27:11.280
bigger than this room. And we're all pretty much the same thing. We may look different,

27:11.280 --> 27:18.280
but in terms of, in a coarse-grained average way in terms of our life history and our physiology,

27:18.280 --> 27:23.320
we're all pretty much the same thing. And I'm going to show you that in a moment. But

27:23.320 --> 27:29.160
even going further, in going from the molecular levels, I could have put the genome here.

27:29.640 --> 27:34.720
This is what the cartoon of the molecules that produce your energy all the way through

27:34.720 --> 27:41.320
mitochondria to cells, to multicellular organisms like this, to produce things like this, houses

27:41.320 --> 27:47.280
and produce things like this, so that, in fact, what goes on here scales all the way

27:47.280 --> 27:54.280
through this to keep this going. All of these have to be scalable because they are highly

27:54.280 --> 28:00.520
complex and high and continuously evolving and continuously adapting. And so there has

28:00.520 --> 28:06.520
to be a kind of scalability. And out of that comes the idea that you can't have this being

28:06.520 --> 28:13.520
arbitrary. There have to be emergent laws that govern this. And I think the next slide,

28:13.520 --> 28:20.280
ah, yes. So in a similar way to the way we scaled in a much shorter time frame in terms

28:20.280 --> 28:25.520
of our growth, and one of the things that I will talk about briefly in a moment is about

28:25.520 --> 28:32.100
growth and the fact that the same theory, the same theoretical framework, which I will

28:32.100 --> 28:40.040
come to in a moment, which ah, it purports to explain the organization dynamics growth

28:40.040 --> 28:47.320
of forests that I talked about earlier applied to us, mammals, gives rise to equations like

28:47.320 --> 28:52.320
this or pictures like this for what is called a growth curve.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.240
This is the weight as a function of age.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.000
This is us.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.440
It happens to be a rat version of us.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.440
And the line there, the solid line,

29:00.440 --> 29:02.880
is a prediction from the theory.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.680
And the points are the data.

29:04.680 --> 29:05.760
And you can see it's very good.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.800
And this can be done for any organism.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.680
And if I had time, I would show you

29:09.680 --> 29:11.480
lots of other wonderful fits.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.800
But the point is that we can understand growth.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.440
And I will come to that in a moment.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.920
But the important thing I want to stress now,

29:19.920 --> 29:24.600
moving to social systems, is that this

29:24.600 --> 29:27.960
were taken over to socioeconomic systems,

29:27.960 --> 29:32.520
namely that the organism grows quickly and then stops,

29:32.520 --> 29:33.240
like we did.

29:33.240 --> 29:36.840
I mean, one of the amazing things about biology

29:36.840 --> 29:40.680
is that we eat, we grow, and then we go on eating,

29:40.680 --> 29:41.920
but we don't grow.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.160
And the theory explains that.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.640
And I don't have time to go into it.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.120
Maybe we can discuss it later.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.040
And it's all to do with the input of energy

29:49.040 --> 29:51.800
and the distribution of energy and the scaling

29:51.800 --> 29:54.120
of the networks that are inside us.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.320
But the point is this would be very bad

29:57.320 --> 29:59.000
if it were a socioeconomic system,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.240
because this is our image of socioeconomic systems.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.720
And I showed you a picture before of the economy,

30:05.720 --> 30:08.080
always open and expanding.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.400
And I want to come back to this in a moment.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.920
So here's a picture of the extraordinary scaling

30:15.920 --> 30:17.360
in biology.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.200
So let me spend a minute on it.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.160
What you see is plotted here is the most fundamental quantity,

30:22.160 --> 30:25.360
certainly from a physicist's view, of in biology.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.920
That is your metabolic rate.

30:26.920 --> 30:31.600
How much energy do you need per day to stay alive?

30:31.600 --> 30:36.400
The 2,000 food calories a day that you eat to stay alive.

30:36.400 --> 30:41.960
And here it is plotted on the vertical axis

30:41.960 --> 30:45.840
against the weight, the mass of the organism,

30:45.840 --> 30:47.320
on the horizontal axis.

30:47.320 --> 30:50.080
And it's plotted in a Byzantine way.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.920
So I can put mice and elephants on the same graph.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.280
And the Byzantine way is that instead of being linear,

30:56.280 --> 31:01.280
it goes up by factors of 10, 1, 10, 100, 1,000 watts,

31:01.280 --> 31:03.960
1, 10, 100, 1,000 kilograms.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.640
So we can get everywhere on the same graph.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.240
And what you see is something extraordinary,

31:08.240 --> 31:12.360
that there's an extraordinary regularity

31:12.360 --> 31:15.200
when we're dealing with maybe one of the most complex

31:15.200 --> 31:18.120
and diverse phenomena in the universe.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.320
Something unbelievably simple, ridiculously simple

31:21.320 --> 31:22.280
has emerged.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.920
And this is at some level astonishing

31:24.920 --> 31:28.440
because we believe that each one of these organisms,

31:28.440 --> 31:32.200
each subsystem of that organism, each organ, each cell

31:32.200 --> 31:36.200
type, each genome has evolved with its own unique history

31:36.200 --> 31:39.280
and its own unique environmental niche.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.320
So you might have expected from that natural selection

31:42.320 --> 31:45.560
viewpoint that if I plotted anything

31:45.560 --> 31:47.160
versus the size of an organism, it'd

31:47.160 --> 31:50.280
be all over the map representing, manifesting

31:50.280 --> 31:53.440
the historical contingency involved in all of this.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.120
No, that's not what you see.

31:55.120 --> 32:01.080
You see something ridiculously, ridiculously regular.

32:01.080 --> 32:05.480
And that regularity has some extraordinary features.

32:05.480 --> 32:11.360
For one, the slope of it is approximately 3 quarters.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.400
And that 3 quarters is less than one.

32:13.400 --> 32:17.120
One would be a slope, a line like this.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.800
And one is what you might naively

32:18.800 --> 32:21.880
expect if you thought everything were pretty much the same.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.520
The most naive level, you double the size of an organism,

32:24.520 --> 32:25.560
double the number of cells.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.440
Therefore, double the amount of energy needed

32:27.440 --> 32:28.800
to keep it alive.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.680
That's not what you see.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.800
You see something less than one, which

32:31.800 --> 32:35.000
means in that language, double the size of an organism.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Approximately instead of needing twice the amount of energy,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.840
you only need roughly 75%.

32:40.840 --> 32:43.440
So there's this extraordinary economy of scale

32:43.440 --> 32:47.120
as you get bigger, and this is called sublinear behavior.

32:47.120 --> 32:53.400
So it turns out that if you look at any physiological variable

32:53.400 --> 32:57.280
that you can measure and or any life history event

32:57.280 --> 33:00.520
that you can think of, it all has this kind of character.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.240
And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.240
There's heart rate, very mundane kind of quantity,

33:06.240 --> 33:07.240
versus body size.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.760
I'm not going to explain it in detail,

33:08.760 --> 33:13.680
but what you see is, again, a very simple scaling law.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.560
This is you thinking.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.640
This is your white matter to gray matter in your brain.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.480
Again, a very simple law evolving.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.160
This is your genomes.

33:23.160 --> 33:26.400
And what you see from this is that you

33:26.400 --> 33:29.200
have this regular behavior, and the other remarkable thing

33:29.200 --> 33:32.120
is all the slopes of those, like that three quarters,

33:32.120 --> 33:34.840
are simple multiples of one quarter.

33:34.840 --> 33:39.800
Four plays this amazing role in these scaling laws

33:39.800 --> 33:43.000
of extraordinary complex phenomena.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.160
What is underlying them?

33:44.160 --> 33:47.720
And this is work I did with colleagues at the Santa Fe

33:47.720 --> 33:50.160
Institute, and I'll tell you who they are in a moment.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.160
The idea is, how in the hell can this

33:52.160 --> 33:58.200
be that all of these phenomena have simple scaling laws?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.480
And why is it that the scaling laws of mammals

34:00.480 --> 34:04.920
are the same as birds, fish, crustacea, insects, and so on?

34:04.920 --> 34:05.880
How can that be?

34:05.880 --> 34:08.280
Well, what could be universal among them?

34:08.280 --> 34:10.520
What could be universal is somehow

34:10.520 --> 34:14.240
the supply of energy and resources through networks

34:14.240 --> 34:16.280
has to be a commonality among them.

34:16.280 --> 34:20.880
And the idea here was that it is the mathematics,

34:20.880 --> 34:25.560
the universal mathematics, and geometric topological properties

34:25.560 --> 34:29.320
of those networks that transcend design,

34:29.320 --> 34:31.840
that are constraining natural selection.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.120
That's the idea.

34:33.120 --> 34:36.040
And I'm not going to, I don't have time to go into that,

34:36.040 --> 34:40.560
other than to say that if you look at these networks,

34:40.560 --> 34:42.960
that's your brain, that's your white-to-gray matter

34:42.960 --> 34:45.640
of the brain, that's your lungs, that's a tree,

34:45.640 --> 34:48.000
that's a little thing, lives inside an elephant,

34:48.000 --> 34:49.520
but they're ubiquitous.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.520
And they have these repositories.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.760
They have these properties.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.400
And if you use those properties, put them

34:55.400 --> 34:59.520
into some fancy mathematics, and use Bill Hamilton's

34:59.520 --> 35:04.960
principle of energy least action kind of ideas,

35:04.960 --> 35:07.960
out-pop all of these marvelous scaling laws,

35:07.960 --> 35:10.240
including the number four, the one quarter, which

35:10.240 --> 35:13.040
happens to be, for the information, the dimension

35:13.040 --> 35:15.080
that we live in, three plus one.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.080
And just to add to that, the plus one

35:17.080 --> 35:20.160
is to do with the fact that these networks have

35:20.160 --> 35:21.520
a fractal-like behavior.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.200
That's a kind of tangential remark.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.200
So here's others.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.800
This is down at the intracellular level.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.400
This is the intermiticondrial level, and so on.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.920
So here's that growth again.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.320
So the idea is we have this theory.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.360
The claim is we have this wonderful theory

35:36.360 --> 35:40.200
that, based on networks, the mathematics of networks,

35:40.200 --> 35:43.720
and that from that, we can understand these scaling laws.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.080
But also, if you like, we understand the network.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.640
We can understand the structure of the network

35:48.640 --> 35:51.240
within each of the organisms.

35:51.240 --> 35:54.360
And you can use that to go back to this growth

35:54.360 --> 35:58.560
and use this kind of idea that, if you eat, you metabolize,

35:58.560 --> 36:03.040
that energy goes through the network, controls the network,

36:03.040 --> 36:05.760
which maintains the cells that are there,

36:05.760 --> 36:08.720
replaces ones that are dead, and grows new ones.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.240
And then from that, you can mathematics it,

36:11.240 --> 36:13.840
and that gives rise to this equation, which

36:13.840 --> 36:17.040
actually invokes all of the properties of the network

36:17.040 --> 36:21.560
and gives rise to these kinds of what we call sigmoidal,

36:21.560 --> 36:25.560
meaning they stop growing curves.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.200
So here's kind of the summary of this part.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.920
We have these amazing nonlinear quarter power scaling laws.

36:32.920 --> 36:36.360
They represent an economy of scale.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.200
The one quarter is intimately related

36:39.200 --> 36:42.600
to flows of energy in networks.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.360
One thing I did not emphasize is the pace of life

36:45.360 --> 36:49.720
systematically slows with size, so that, for example, heart

36:49.720 --> 36:51.920
rates decrease systematically according

36:51.920 --> 36:54.440
to these quarter power scaling laws.

36:54.440 --> 36:58.600
The rate of diffusion of oxygen, say, across membranes,

36:58.600 --> 37:00.440
decreases with size.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.800
Organisms live longer systematically,

37:02.800 --> 37:03.760
and so on and so forth.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.960
Everything to do with time slows down the bigger you are.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.600
Growth is sigmoidal, reaches a stable size of maturity.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.680
And to emphasize again, the idea is

37:13.720 --> 37:17.040
this is all based on the mathematics and properties

37:17.040 --> 37:18.320
of networks.

37:18.320 --> 37:23.280
So, and this is a sustainable system.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.680
It's sustainable phenomenologically,

37:25.680 --> 37:30.440
because it's been around a couple of billion years or more.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.560
Part of that sustainability, I believe,

37:32.560 --> 37:38.040
is actually invoked in the fact that things stop growing.

37:38.040 --> 37:41.840
They stabilize, and most organisms, not all,

37:41.840 --> 37:43.200
and we can discuss this.

37:43.200 --> 37:46.800
Most organisms spend most of their mature life

37:46.800 --> 37:49.760
in a stable size configuration.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.040
Not all, and there are exceptions,

37:51.040 --> 37:52.080
and we can discuss that.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.080
But this leads to a sustainable, resilient system.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.480
And the question is, oh, I'm sorry, yes.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.640
So this is the Motley crew that I work with,

38:00.640 --> 38:03.320
some are biologists, some physicists, some chemists.

38:03.320 --> 38:08.000
But I then took the work over into social organizations,

38:08.000 --> 38:11.320
and there's another Motley crew, that the top guys did

38:11.320 --> 38:13.760
all the work.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.760
All the guys at the bottom are famous

38:15.760 --> 38:17.440
and did none of the work.

38:17.440 --> 38:20.880
And the guys in the middle started off with me

38:20.880 --> 38:22.960
and then moved on to other things.

38:22.960 --> 38:27.680
OK, so here's the question, the first question,

38:27.680 --> 38:30.880
about whether cities and companies are biological.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.680
The first thing is, do they scale?

38:32.680 --> 38:38.680
So what we said before was that whales live in the ocean,

38:38.680 --> 38:41.000
and elephants have trunks, and giraffes long necks,

38:41.000 --> 38:43.640
and we stand on two feet, and mice scurry around.

38:43.640 --> 38:47.000
But in fact, at the kind of 85% level,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.120
then scaled versions of one another

38:49.120 --> 38:51.760
in this nonlinear, quarter-power fashion,

38:51.760 --> 38:53.280
this mathematical fashion.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.960
They're scaled versions of one another.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.680
Is that true of cities?

38:57.680 --> 38:59.680
And is it a kind of universal scaling,

38:59.680 --> 39:00.760
as it is in biology?

39:00.760 --> 39:03.960
So are cities scaled versions of one another?

39:03.960 --> 39:07.160
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,

39:07.160 --> 39:10.960
which is a scaled up Madison, which is a scaled up Santa Fe?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.760
Even though they look completely different?

39:12.760 --> 39:14.160
Well, you can only answer that.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.000
I mean, first sight, it's hard to believe.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.160
Every city feels so unique.

39:20.160 --> 39:25.240
But of course, you can only answer that by looking at data.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.400
But one of the reasons you might think

39:27.400 --> 39:30.520
there are scaling phenomena, there

39:30.520 --> 39:33.720
are these kind of generic universal similarities,

39:33.720 --> 39:36.880
is because cities are indeed networks.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.400
I mean, there's the obvious networks

39:38.400 --> 39:42.040
of roads and electrical lines and all the rest of it,

39:42.040 --> 39:46.080
like this, transportation systems.

39:46.080 --> 39:50.840
But more importantly, there's this network, which never

39:50.840 --> 39:52.720
occurs, essentially, in biology.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.880
It is the network of us talking to one another.

39:55.880 --> 39:59.040
It's us, social networks, that is unique.

39:59.040 --> 40:05.120
It's only been around on this planet for maybe 10,000 years.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.840
Maybe in the universe, for all we know, for 10,000 years.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.440
But certainly, in our solar system, this is it.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.600
It's new.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.360
And it's this.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.240
This is just people talking to one another,

40:16.240 --> 40:18.840
how they interact with one another.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.120
So whoops, I seem to have lost the slide.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.000
It doesn't matter.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.880
So I use this slide.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.360
What is the city but the people?

40:25.360 --> 40:28.160
Indeed, the city is not the buildings and the roads

40:28.160 --> 40:30.200
and all these other stuff.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.000
It's us.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.680
We are the city.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.520
And that stuff is a manifestation

40:35.520 --> 40:37.320
of the interactions between us.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.600
And that's something that is outside of biology

40:40.600 --> 40:43.840
but is integral to biology because it's driven by biology

40:43.840 --> 40:47.200
and it's driven in large part by energy.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.320
And I'm going to talk about that.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.840
So the other part of the network is not just

40:51.840 --> 40:54.240
that we interact with each other but we cluster.

40:54.240 --> 40:56.760
So I'm going to not say much more about that

40:56.760 --> 41:00.720
but go straight to the data and ask the question about scaling.

41:00.720 --> 41:05.520
So this is a graph plotted in the same way

41:05.520 --> 41:07.400
as those biological graphs were.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.560
But this is a mundane one, the number of petrol stations.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.680
I was working with European colleagues,

41:12.680 --> 41:16.720
number of gas stations in a city as a function of its size

41:16.720 --> 41:18.120
in various countries.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.000
And you can see there's pretty good evidence of scaling.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.880
It's again, there's a very simple line on this plot

41:24.880 --> 41:27.840
plotted this way, very much like biology.

41:27.840 --> 41:31.160
And like biology, this would be linear

41:31.160 --> 41:34.760
so that you don't, when you double the size of a city,

41:34.760 --> 41:36.920
you don't need twice as many gas stations.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.640
In fact, what you find from this,

41:38.640 --> 41:41.720
you only need about 85% more gas stations.

41:41.720 --> 41:45.160
The slope of this line is not three quarters

41:45.160 --> 41:48.160
as it is in biology, it's about 0.85, it turns out.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.840
Most importantly though is that they're pretty much the same.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.600
The slopes of these are the same.

41:53.600 --> 41:56.520
The same economy of scale occurs

41:56.520 --> 41:58.320
in all these European countries

41:58.320 --> 42:00.200
but it occurs in Colombia.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.520
It occurs in Chile, it occurs in China.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.000
Anywhere you look, across the globe,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.520
you get the same scaling and if you look

42:08.520 --> 42:11.480
at any infrastructural quantity that you can measure,

42:11.480 --> 42:13.640
you get the same scaling as this.

42:13.640 --> 42:18.640
There's a consistent, always roughly 15% saving

42:19.000 --> 42:20.880
every time you double, okay?

42:20.880 --> 42:22.320
Okay, 10.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.160
Good, perfect.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.320
So this is kind of a mundane quantity

42:27.320 --> 42:29.520
but here's, and that's like biology.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.800
Looks just like biology except it's 0.85

42:32.000 --> 42:37.440
but this is something that doesn't exist in biology.

42:37.440 --> 42:41.760
Wages, you lot, super creative people

42:41.760 --> 42:43.800
and you ask how do those scale

42:43.800 --> 42:46.240
with the size of the city and here they are.

42:46.240 --> 42:50.160
This is wages at the top and this is super creative,

42:50.160 --> 42:53.160
so-called super creative by a man named Richard Florida

42:53.160 --> 42:57.360
and what you see is there's more fluctuations in the data

42:57.360 --> 43:00.360
but there's pretty good evidence of scaling

43:00.360 --> 43:03.880
but most importantly, the scaling is different

43:03.880 --> 43:05.120
than in biology.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.240
The slope of these are bigger than one

43:07.240 --> 43:09.800
rather than less than one and this is critical.

43:09.800 --> 43:14.640
Namely, the slope of these you see is roughly about 1.15

43:14.640 --> 43:19.640
so that what that says is that if you double the size

43:19.800 --> 43:22.200
instead of needing less per capita,

43:22.200 --> 43:23.760
you have more per capita

43:23.760 --> 43:25.800
and I will come back to this in a moment.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.720
So here's wages, super creative,

43:28.760 --> 43:32.600
here's patents, this is some prude measure

43:32.600 --> 43:34.520
of the innovation of a city.

43:35.680 --> 43:39.000
The slope of this is also about 1.15,

43:39.000 --> 43:43.360
this is the crime in Japan, so a little bit bigger, 1.15,

43:43.360 --> 43:46.000
this is police, tax receipts, construction,

43:46.000 --> 43:49.640
all about 1.15 and there they are all plotted

43:49.640 --> 43:51.600
on one another, just a few of them

43:51.600 --> 43:56.600
to show a universality of income, GDP, crime and patents,

43:57.480 --> 44:01.320
very different things but they all scale in the same way,

44:01.320 --> 44:03.280
there's quite a lot of fluctuations

44:03.280 --> 44:07.000
and the slope of that is roughly 1.15

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
and what is, we believe that underlying this

44:12.320 --> 44:15.120
the universality of social networks

44:15.120 --> 44:17.760
of the way we interact with each other

44:18.600 --> 44:20.640
is a kind of universal phenomenon

44:20.640 --> 44:23.600
whether you're in China, Japan, Columbia,

44:23.600 --> 44:25.320
the United States, anywhere,

44:25.320 --> 44:28.880
the fundamentals of the social interaction is universal

44:28.880 --> 44:31.600
and that is what is being manifested

44:31.600 --> 44:33.800
in these scaling laws, these scaling laws

44:33.800 --> 44:36.760
are for multiple socioeconomic quantities

44:36.760 --> 44:39.120
anywhere in the world, we've looked at data

44:39.120 --> 44:41.640
in Europe, the United States, China, Japan,

44:41.640 --> 44:43.320
Latin America and so forth.

44:44.260 --> 44:47.240
What is interesting to substantiate that

44:47.240 --> 44:49.960
is this graph which is very recent data

44:49.960 --> 44:53.240
which is the number of cell phone people,

44:53.240 --> 44:56.320
none of the people you call on your phone

44:56.320 --> 44:59.440
on the average as a function of city size.

44:59.440 --> 45:02.320
So this is a kind of way of tapping in

45:02.320 --> 45:05.800
to the network, the social network

45:05.800 --> 45:08.880
and if this theoretical framework

45:08.880 --> 45:11.440
of the mathematics of that social network

45:11.440 --> 45:14.680
is the right one, the slope of this should be

45:14.680 --> 45:16.600
about the same as these other networks

45:16.600 --> 45:20.040
and indeed we could have plotted this on top of this

45:20.040 --> 45:21.880
and it would have fit right on top of it.

45:21.880 --> 45:24.680
So this is the number of people you talk to

45:24.680 --> 45:29.320
on the average as a function of your city size, okay.

45:29.320 --> 45:32.720
So I'm gonna miss this

45:32.720 --> 45:34.360
and that's what I said a moment ago

45:34.360 --> 45:36.200
and here's kind of the summary of this,

45:36.200 --> 45:38.080
the good, the bad and the ugly.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.040
If you double the size of a city

45:40.040 --> 45:42.160
or if you look at a city that's twice as big

45:42.160 --> 45:46.520
as another city, then systematically across the globe

45:48.320 --> 45:50.880
and you double the size, you can go from 50,000

45:50.920 --> 45:53.320
to 100,000 or 5,000,000 to 10,000,000

45:53.320 --> 45:55.600
doesn't matter where you begin, just double the size,

45:55.600 --> 45:59.000
systematically income, wealth, patents, colleges,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.800
creative people, police, crime, AIDS, flu,

46:01.800 --> 46:04.080
all of these things, the good, bad and the ugly

46:04.080 --> 46:06.880
all go up together to the same degree

46:07.760 --> 46:12.040
and at the same time, you save about 15%

46:12.040 --> 46:13.920
on the infrastructure.

46:13.920 --> 46:17.800
Big cities are good and the bigger ones are better still

46:17.800 --> 46:19.440
both at the collective level,

46:19.440 --> 46:22.520
they save on infrastructure per capita,

46:22.520 --> 46:24.320
I had a graph which I flipped through,

46:24.320 --> 46:27.200
they save on carbon footprint per capita

46:27.200 --> 46:29.040
and at the individual level,

46:31.860 --> 46:34.200
everybody is attracted to cities

46:34.200 --> 46:36.200
by the first lot of those income, wealth,

46:36.200 --> 46:39.400
number of patents, colleges and the general buzz of city

46:39.400 --> 46:40.960
and ignore the other bad things,

46:40.960 --> 46:42.760
the fact that they're coming along with it,

46:42.760 --> 46:47.760
handing glove as more crime, disease and so forth, okay.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.480
So, the network dynamics is the one

46:52.480 --> 46:54.720
that dominates this again

46:54.720 --> 46:57.360
and the network dynamics has the following

46:57.360 --> 47:02.360
interesting phenomenon that if it's sublinear scaling,

47:03.520 --> 47:06.920
then we have this pace of life slowing with size

47:06.920 --> 47:09.160
that I mentioned, but if it's super linear,

47:09.160 --> 47:13.320
bigger than one that we see in socioeconomic systems

47:13.320 --> 47:18.100
in cities and are driven by the social networks,

47:18.100 --> 47:20.540
then the theory tells you the pace of life

47:20.540 --> 47:23.300
systematically increases with size

47:23.300 --> 47:26.540
and so the pace of life in New York

47:26.540 --> 47:30.700
is systematically faster than it is in Madison,

47:30.700 --> 47:34.140
which is systematically faster than it is in Espanola,

47:34.140 --> 47:38.660
which is a tiny town here, Santa Fe, in a systematic way

47:38.660 --> 47:42.020
and here's some whimsical data to show you that,

47:42.020 --> 47:43.060
we've looked at many things,

47:43.060 --> 47:46.300
on the left is some data on heart rate versus body size,

47:46.300 --> 47:48.820
the one on the right is walking speed,

47:48.820 --> 47:49.900
show you walking speed,

47:49.900 --> 47:51.900
there's people have actually measured walking speed,

47:51.900 --> 47:56.900
perfect and you can see it's systematically rising

47:56.900 --> 47:59.380
and it's in reasonably good agreement with the data,

47:59.380 --> 48:03.540
but that, you know, why, because walking actually,

48:03.540 --> 48:07.900
walking in a city is a social phenomenon, okay.

48:07.900 --> 48:10.820
So, I'm gonna miss this out, I think.

48:12.620 --> 48:14.140
So, this is kind of a summary

48:14.140 --> 48:16.340
and I'm gonna finish off in the last few minutes

48:16.340 --> 48:17.340
with the last part of this.

48:17.340 --> 48:22.260
So, unlike biology, super linear scaling,

48:22.260 --> 48:24.980
socioeconomic, which is to do with wealth creation

48:24.980 --> 48:28.620
and innovation and ideas, dominates,

48:28.620 --> 48:30.860
and so you get this kind of 15% rule,

48:30.860 --> 48:34.140
which I'm not gonna talk about its origins here,

48:34.140 --> 48:36.620
that also leads to a systematic increase

48:36.620 --> 48:38.540
in the pace of life and the last thing

48:38.540 --> 48:42.100
I'm gonna talk about, which is very satisfactory,

48:42.100 --> 48:44.740
is that if this is true, which it is,

48:44.740 --> 48:46.640
and it comes from these networks,

48:46.640 --> 48:50.020
then I'm gonna talk about growth

48:50.020 --> 48:52.660
and the idea of open-ended growth following from this

48:52.660 --> 48:56.380
because we're gonna use the same kind of growth equation

48:56.380 --> 49:00.260
that, again, based on energy equivalent

49:00.260 --> 49:02.340
of the flow of energy through these systems

49:02.340 --> 49:06.080
leading to maintenance and growth,

49:06.080 --> 49:09.100
and that's what we had before for us,

49:09.100 --> 49:12.060
the sublinear scaling leading to bounded growth

49:12.060 --> 49:14.240
and if it's super linear scaling,

49:14.240 --> 49:15.820
there's a cartoon on the left,

49:15.820 --> 49:20.820
this leads to actually faster than exponential growth.

49:21.300 --> 49:23.700
And that's very satisfying, that's great,

49:23.700 --> 49:24.900
because that's what we see

49:24.900 --> 49:27.140
and that's what we apparently love

49:27.140 --> 49:29.340
or have loved for the last couple of hundred years

49:29.340 --> 49:30.260
and that's great.

49:30.260 --> 49:33.860
However, it has, if you believe the theory,

49:33.860 --> 49:36.660
this has a fatal flaw

49:36.660 --> 49:40.740
and the fatal flaw is denoted by this line

49:40.780 --> 49:42.900
and it's called in the technical language

49:42.900 --> 49:45.460
a finite time singularity

49:45.460 --> 49:48.020
and to put it in very simple language,

49:48.020 --> 49:50.980
what it says is that in some finite time,

49:50.980 --> 49:54.660
this damn growth curve will go to infinite size

49:54.660 --> 49:56.380
and that's obviously impossible.

49:56.380 --> 49:58.340
So this is kind of a Malthusian argument,

49:58.340 --> 50:00.180
namely at some stage,

50:00.180 --> 50:01.980
you're gonna run out of whatever it is

50:01.980 --> 50:03.660
that's keeping the system alive,

50:03.660 --> 50:06.300
the resources, the energy, whatever it is

50:06.300 --> 50:08.220
and the theory tells you what happens,

50:08.260 --> 50:11.180
it says as you go through this so-called singularity,

50:11.180 --> 50:13.220
you stagnate and collapse.

50:13.220 --> 50:15.500
That's terrible and we need to avoid that

50:15.500 --> 50:17.340
and we have avoided it

50:17.340 --> 50:19.100
and this is how we avoid it.

50:19.100 --> 50:22.620
We avoid it for the very reason

50:22.620 --> 50:27.620
that Malthus and Paul Ehrlich were rejected,

50:27.740 --> 50:30.060
that is they did not take into account

50:30.060 --> 50:32.780
the fact that we innovate ourselves out of these problems.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.440
So I wanna finish on this note.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.880
So here's the situation.

50:36.880 --> 50:41.440
This is you start at some point and you start growing

50:41.440 --> 50:45.040
and you would hit this singularity and collapse.

50:45.040 --> 50:47.520
So somewhere along here,

50:48.740 --> 50:50.840
you better change something

50:50.840 --> 50:54.840
because this growth was done in the paradigm

50:54.840 --> 50:56.600
of whatever the major innovation is.

50:56.600 --> 50:59.120
It could be the discovery of iron,

50:59.120 --> 51:01.680
could be the discovery of coal, could be oil,

51:01.680 --> 51:03.760
it could be the invention of computers,

51:03.760 --> 51:05.240
the invention of IT,

51:05.240 --> 51:08.880
that's something major that has a kind of paradigm shift

51:08.880 --> 51:09.920
and changes everything.

51:09.920 --> 51:14.560
So this suggests that the way out of this dilemma

51:14.560 --> 51:19.080
of collapse is that you innovate somewhere here

51:19.080 --> 51:20.200
and you start over again.

51:20.200 --> 51:23.800
You reset the clock and then you can go on merrily

51:23.800 --> 51:24.640
and of course you're gonna hit

51:24.640 --> 51:27.040
another finite time singularity and collapse

51:27.040 --> 51:29.260
unless you innovate again.

51:29.260 --> 51:30.560
So you have to keep innovating.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.480
So there's a kind of theorem if you like

51:33.480 --> 51:37.160
that if you want to continue to have open-ended growth,

51:37.160 --> 51:38.920
you have to have cycles of innovation.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.680
Well, people have been saying things like that

51:40.680 --> 51:42.120
for a long time.

51:42.120 --> 51:45.760
Here's the difference going back to what we said.

51:48.160 --> 51:52.440
As you grow and you get bigger, the pace of life increases.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.520
So first of all, the pace of life is increasing.

51:54.520 --> 51:57.280
Second thing is it turns out the theory says,

51:57.280 --> 51:58.800
yes, you can do this,

51:58.840 --> 52:03.840
but the time to go from here to here necessarily

52:03.920 --> 52:07.040
has to be and systematically shorter

52:07.040 --> 52:08.840
than the time from here to here.

52:08.840 --> 52:10.160
So that you can innovate,

52:10.160 --> 52:11.920
you can have these cycles of innovation,

52:11.920 --> 52:13.880
but they must come quicker and quicker.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.760
So the image is that we're on this treadmill

52:18.760 --> 52:21.360
that is going faster and faster,

52:21.360 --> 52:23.240
which is difficult to begin with.

52:23.240 --> 52:27.160
But at some stage you've got to jump from that treadmill

52:27.160 --> 52:30.400
onto another treadmill that's going even faster.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.920
And then very soon you've got to jump onto another one

52:32.920 --> 52:34.800
and you've got to kind of keep doing this.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.000
So you have this kind of double acceleration

52:37.000 --> 52:38.200
and the question is,

52:38.200 --> 52:41.640
do you suffer a kind of global heart attack from that?

52:41.640 --> 52:43.680
So is this sustainable?

52:44.520 --> 52:46.200
Obviously not, ultimately.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.120
And here's, this is not mine at all.

52:49.120 --> 52:52.040
This is someone I don't know who he is, but he did it

52:52.040 --> 52:54.480
and he showed, you know, it was great.

52:54.480 --> 52:58.600
Oh, this is something I saw in an English newspaper

52:58.600 --> 53:02.320
a week ago, which I thought illustrated the point

53:02.320 --> 53:03.160
a little bit.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.200
So here's something, some of you may have heard

53:07.200 --> 53:10.440
of the idea of singularity from this,

53:10.440 --> 53:14.800
what I consider a little bit loony work of Ray Kurzweil.

53:15.960 --> 53:16.920
I think this is loony,

53:16.920 --> 53:19.520
but he did some wonderful things of collecting data.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.200
I don't agree with a lot of this,

53:21.200 --> 53:24.240
but what he's plotted here is that

53:24.320 --> 53:26.840
here's the paradigm shift.

53:26.840 --> 53:31.840
That is, how long it took to create each one

53:31.960 --> 53:36.560
of these paradigms versus how long ago it happened.

53:36.560 --> 53:41.080
Okay, so, and what you see is it takes shorter and shorter

53:41.080 --> 53:44.680
times to make these shifts

53:44.680 --> 53:46.800
and it's happening faster and faster.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.200
And he drew this, he got them,

53:48.200 --> 53:50.200
there's all kinds of people who've done things like this.

53:50.200 --> 53:51.760
I'm gonna finish up.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.720
And whoops.

53:53.720 --> 53:57.560
And interestingly enough, that straight line,

53:57.560 --> 53:59.440
if you take this theoretical framework

53:59.440 --> 54:00.560
that I just told you about,

54:00.560 --> 54:02.780
this continuous innovation and jumping

54:02.780 --> 54:04.760
from one treadmill to another,

54:04.760 --> 54:07.960
it predicts almost exactly that orange line.

54:07.960 --> 54:10.880
So that's data kind of supporting it.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.520
So I'm gonna finish with that

54:12.520 --> 54:15.480
and I'm gonna finish with one last image,

54:15.480 --> 54:18.240
which is this, just to give you a sense of things

54:18.240 --> 54:21.120
in terms of energy, our metabolic rate,

54:21.120 --> 54:22.760
I didn't point that out on the graph.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.480
You remember that graph of metabolic rate?

54:24.480 --> 54:28.080
Our metabolic rate in watts is about 90 watts,

54:28.080 --> 54:30.920
a little bit less women versus men,

54:30.920 --> 54:32.320
but roughly it's about 90 watts.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.160
We're a light bulb.

54:33.160 --> 54:37.640
One of the bloody light bulbs is equivalent to one of us.

54:37.640 --> 54:40.400
So turning a light bulb off,

54:40.400 --> 54:41.600
it's like your mother turning you.

54:41.600 --> 54:44.360
If you turn it off, you help the starving people

54:44.360 --> 54:46.280
in Sudan or somewhere.

54:46.280 --> 54:49.640
So it's ridiculous having all these lights on, frankly.

54:49.640 --> 54:50.480
They're us.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.640
We are extraordinarily efficient.

54:52.640 --> 54:56.720
That 1,800, 2,000 food calories a day

54:56.720 --> 54:58.960
is unbelievably efficient.

54:58.960 --> 55:01.800
May seem like a lot of food, but it's just a light bulb.

55:03.360 --> 55:06.920
However, and incidentally,

55:06.920 --> 55:10.240
that metabolic rate is the metabolic rate

55:10.240 --> 55:13.880
we should have for a mammal of our size.

55:13.880 --> 55:16.160
That's what we should have, okay?

55:16.200 --> 55:19.960
And if you add in activity, hunting and gathering,

55:19.960 --> 55:23.080
which is the way we evolve or versions thereof,

55:23.080 --> 55:26.080
that number changes from 100 to about 250,

55:26.080 --> 55:28.560
the amount of energy we do to hunt and gather and so on.

55:28.560 --> 55:32.800
And that also scales the active metabolic rate for mammals.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.600
So that's what we, quote, should have.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.600
Then we started talking to one another.

55:38.600 --> 55:41.720
We discovered economies of scale to form communities,

55:41.720 --> 55:43.440
and then we started to innovate.

55:43.440 --> 55:44.960
And once we innovated,

55:44.960 --> 55:47.480
we created all of this around us,

55:47.480 --> 55:50.680
all this wonderful quality of life and standard of living

55:50.680 --> 55:52.560
that we'd like to have for everybody.

55:52.560 --> 55:55.680
And we can ask, what is our real metabolic rate?

55:55.680 --> 55:57.320
What is our social metabolic rate

55:57.320 --> 55:59.880
of having cars and lights and buildings

55:59.880 --> 56:01.560
and all the rest of the stuff?

56:01.560 --> 56:06.560
That number goes from about 90 watts to 11,000 watts.

56:07.600 --> 56:08.760
And you can turn it around,

56:08.760 --> 56:11.400
as has been done on this graph as I did here,

56:11.400 --> 56:13.200
and ask, how big is it?

56:13.200 --> 56:14.680
What big an animal are we?

56:14.680 --> 56:18.000
This is about a dozen elephants,

56:18.000 --> 56:19.520
each one of us in this room.

56:19.520 --> 56:21.920
And there are seven billion people of us on this planet

56:21.920 --> 56:23.840
who all want to be like us,

56:23.840 --> 56:27.440
and there's three billion more coming in the next 30, 40 years,

56:27.440 --> 56:30.360
and they all want to be like us using 11,000 watts.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.600
So this is an enormous problem,

56:33.600 --> 56:35.640
and I cannot answer the question,

56:35.640 --> 56:37.840
what is the future and what does it bring?

56:37.840 --> 56:40.640
But I can say that I'm a pessimist.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.000
So I'll finish on that.

56:42.000 --> 56:42.840
Oh.

56:42.840 --> 56:43.680
Thank you.

56:43.680 --> 56:44.520
Thank you.

56:44.520 --> 56:45.360
Thank you.
