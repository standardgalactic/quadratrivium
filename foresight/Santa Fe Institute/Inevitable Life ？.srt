1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, of course, it's a great pleasure to introduce my colleague today, Eric Smith.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Partly because he's not just a colleague, he's a friend of mine, and he's a collaborator at the Institute.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight's lecture, as you know, is on the topic of life, the inevitability of life,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and its origins in relation to geochemistry.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, one of the unfortunate tendencies of the human mind is to think categorically,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to think in terms of dichotomies, living, non-living, conscious, not conscious, good and evil.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But, of course, the world is not categorical, it's more continuous.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And, of course, this tendency to categorise extends to institutions, departments, physics departments,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
biology departments, literature departments, architecture departments.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And for those of you who've been coming to these public lectures, you will know that the Santa Fe Institute often stands in opposition

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to a rather simple-minded categorisation of the world, both institutional, intellectual and metaphysical.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, the topic of life, of course, derives some of its charge from the sort of categorical,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
dichotomous opposition it stands in relation to the inanimate world, to non-life.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I want you to read you a quick quote from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is a preface that she wrote to the book in 1818.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, presumably, she couldn't get a word in.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed and, among others, the nature of the principle of life.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And whether there was any possibility or probability of its ever being discovered and communicated, perhaps a corpse would be reanimated,

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Galvanism had given a token of such things.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Galvanim, of course, being the application of current to muscles and their subsequent contraction.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And, of course, there are other stories like that of the Gollum.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Gollum is mentioned in the Talmud, where Adam, in fact, was first a Gollum made from dust,

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and the famous Gollum, of course, of Prague, the 16th-century Rabbi Low,

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
who constructed a creature to work on the Sabbath out of the mud of the banks of the River Volta in Prague.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And, of course, more recently, computer viruses, which some people think are alive.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now, all of these narratives, Frankenstein, viruses, and the Gollum, life springs from physical and chemical processes.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It doesn't spring from existing life.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not like birth, where living things spawn living things.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
These are non-living things, spawning living things.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
At some point in the history of the earth, presumably there was no biology,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and some disposition of chemistry and physics gave rise to biology and the subsequent evolution of life.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And these are the things that Eric's going to talk about.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, Eric has done his fair share of raising disciplinary boundaries.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He was an undergrad at Caltech, where he did his degree in mathematics and physics.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He was then a post-graduate student in Austin, Texas, where he worked in string theory and quantum gravity.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And then he was a post-doc at Texas and then at Los Anamos before coming to the Santa Fe Institute.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
His interests include the emergence of life that he'll talk about today, but they're not restricted to the emergence of life.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's also interested in the correspondences between economic processes, physical processes, and living processes, biological ones,

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and also the connections between energy, information, and computation.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So in tonight's lecture, Eric will ask whether, contrary I think to our intuitions, life might not be inevitable in the universe rather than rare.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Eric.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you all for coming. David, thank you.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Wonderful introduction. It sets just exactly the right tone.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because in a subject where there has been too much oversimplification and too much soundbite reporting,

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to try to give you some sense of the richness and the beauty of the picture that comes up if we ask about the position of life on Earth.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So let me stop this thing.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And...

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Good.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So tonight I get to tell you some facts or some new ideas about the emergence of life on Earth

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that I think will change what many of us have been told about whether we should think that life on Earth is surprising or inevitable

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and how we should ask questions like this.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
At the same time as answering this question, it should change our understanding of the position of the biosphere within the geological world

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and several important aspects of our position as people or as animals within the biosphere.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So there are many different messages that all sort of inform each other.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I want to set us tonight the task of answering four questions.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
First one, why is there life on Earth at all as opposed to nothing or as opposed to an empty rocky planet?

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How and where did it originate? Sort of obvious questions of mechanism.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Why has life persisted?

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is important because I think if we have a sensible understanding of how life emerged,

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that must also make it sensible that life has stayed because the things that cause it to persist are the same things that caused it to emerge in the first place.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So the questions must be asked and answered sensibly together.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then, last of all, does the biosphere contain relics of emergence so that by looking at what life is today,

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
we have a window that's informative about how it came into existence?

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now, before I can address any of these sort of forward-looking questions,

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have to address a question that has been a problem in this topic,

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
which is whether science can say anything about these problems at all.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And of course, since I'm here on behalf of the Institute talking to you about science,

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you would think that this is a foregone answer,

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
but if we poll some influential 20th century scientists and particular biologists,

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the returns we get are a little bit surprising.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So let me start with Stephen Jay Gould.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I actually chose my talk title tonight as a response to Gould's very wonderful little book called Wonderful Life.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Many of you will probably have read it, and it had a big influence on me with my first exposures to biology,

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and it's a really important work of this century.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Gould chose the title for his book on the basis of Frank Capra's 1946 movie, It's a Wonderful Life,

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
because he felt that the movie told exactly the story he wanted to tell.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a story that an individual's actions can have permanent and important consequences.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And Gould's message about biology was that for the first time in science,

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
things that seem to be accidental can have consequences that could last forever.

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, of course, being Gould and fighting the last war against oversimplification,

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
he states things in the strongest possible terms.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Any replay of the tape would lead evolution down a pathway radically different from the road actually taken.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now, if you take this at face value or in the context of the book,

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
it makes it sound like accidents are all that matters,

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
which kind of leaves us wondering what then is the role for science,

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
not the same as in the other sciences maybe.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Gould, of course, worked with things that are big enough to see without a microscope and it can leave fossils.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go to somebody who works with things that are smaller.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is Jacques Monot, who, the year I was born in 1965,

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
won a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his work on the regulation of cell machinery from the gene.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Monot wrote a lasting influential book called Chance and Necessity.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
His concern was one that we've heard many times,

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
a wish that people not imprint human notions of purpose on biological descriptions of how machinery works.

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And he was interested in arguing against two things in particular.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The two ways people tend to imprint purpose.

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
One, vitalism would have been a claim that when matter becomes part of a living thing,

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
it's no longer the same as other matter and we can't understand it.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The other, animism, which says, well, it's all matter, but it all has purpose from the beginning.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think Monot's point in arguing this was to try to bring biology closer together to the other sciences

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and the way they're understood.

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But, of course, Monot was primarily a guy who explains how machinery works

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and how machinery works doesn't necessarily provide a good explanation of why it's there at all or how it got there.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And so, faced with this difficulty, he makes a statement that if anything is even stronger than Gould's.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He says, the biosphere does not contain a predictable class of objects or of events,

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
but constitutes a particular occurrence, compatible indeed with first principles,

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but not dedusible from those principles and essentially unpredictable.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So he starts out trying to bring biology together with the other sciences

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and with this sort of encapsulating statement, if anything, it makes biology seem even more remote from the other sciences

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and leaves us wondering what can we say.

111
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But the granddaddy of them all, as far as strong statements, is Francis Crick.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Crick, together with Jim Watson, discovered the double helix structure of DNA

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and first realized that this was the molecule that could be responsible for heredity in the way it works.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And Crick takes this sort of accidentalist viewpoint of Gould and Monot

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
all the way back to the beginning by associating the emergence of life

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
with the emergence of something like DNA and heredity.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So early, you see him here, he's looking sort of appropriately like a sorcerer,

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
presumably lecturing on the structure of the molecule that's the key to life itself.

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And I think a lot of people have tried to think of DNA in those terms

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and I'm going to try to push back a little against that tonight.

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But he refers to the emergence of life as a happy accident

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and a little bit later goes on to say, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle.

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So many are the conditions which would have to have been satisfied to get it going.

124
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Now, if there's one thing we know science does not claim to be able to talk about, it's miracles,

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
so while this is not necessarily a logical impossibility,

126
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
it seems like a very strange point of view for a scientist to be putting forward as a scientific conclusion

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
because it amounts essentially to throwing up one's hands and saying,

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
oh, we can't say anything about that part.

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So if there is ambiguity in the public's understanding of what science has to say about the emergence of life,

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think it would not be blamed on the public.

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Maybe we should start by looking at the things scientists have said.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But if there's ambiguity, it should be leading us to ask three important questions.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
As one of my favorite political commentators says, what were they thinking?

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Specifically, what aspect of biology are these people looking at

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that would cause them to draw such seemingly odd conclusions?

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
For us, what's important is, is this really science?

137
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Is this the nature of life that they're talking about,

138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
or is it actually a nature of their point of view which might be narrow and might have left things out?

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Because if it is just a prejudice that comes from not having looked at everything

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and we can broaden our perspective a little bit,

141
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
maybe we can find that from a bigger perspective there's a story that's not all about accident

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and that's truer to the nature of life, not necessarily to the history of science.

143
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So that's what the rest of tonight is supposed to be about.

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So what were they thinking?

145
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Most of us who have seen anything about the history of life

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
have seen a picture something like this.

147
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We see many pictures of trees of life.

148
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let me very briefly tell you what this is in case it's not familiar.

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Every name here at the end, elegant things like methanosarsina and entoamibi,

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
these are big groups of organisms.

151
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The tree is basically much too small for me to be able to show individual organisms.

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And as we go down any of these lines,

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
what you're seeing is the history that led up to the organism as it is today.

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So when you see then two lines that become one line in the past,

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the idea is that two things that are today different once had an ancestor that was a single thing.

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So one could easily talk for days about just this tree.

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There's so much interesting to know about it.

158
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll mention only a few things.

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
One, this is a representation of data that says that everything we know about in the earth is related to everything else.

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And as far as we can tell, everything that's around today came at some point from one single form

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that was a bottleneck from which the survivors descended.

162
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now, to give you a sense of scale, everything that you can see without a microscope

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
is these three little branches here, the plants, animals, and the fungi.

164
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So the rest of what is alive in the world is individual cells.

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Now, I couldn't make this dot small enough to only cover all of human history,

166
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
so it's about ten times too big for that.

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And it's kind of a useful thing to give us a sense of what part people are in the natural world.

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And not only scientifically, but also as human beings.

169
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But the thing that I really want to point out to you about trees that's important is

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
that the only time similarities, and that's what these trees are, I should mention,

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the trees are trees of family resemblances.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You see a trait that's into things and not anywhere else.

173
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You infer that those two things, that the trait came from a time when those two things were once a single population of organisms.

174
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Now, the only way having the same trait implies that you're related to the others that have the trait

175
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
is if that is infinitely accidental.

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So this is the reason you can't use skin darkness to figure out who's related to whom.

177
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Because as soon as you move toward the equator, you have to get darker to survive.

178
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You move away from the equator, you have to get lighter to survive.

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So these things can change so fast, and they can change in so many ways

180
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that they're not good guides to what is related to what.

181
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So the only time family resemblances imply a tree is when the change along these branches

182
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
is in characters that are so rare that it's amazing they ever occurred,

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and if they're lost, they're gone forever.

184
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So the reason Gould sees accident is that Gould's life was understanding the structure and the relations of this tree,

185
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
which is a thing that emphasizes the accidental parts of life.

186
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But we still have to understand why anything about life is so accidental

187
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that it would make a tree, that the family relations would be that.

188
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And to understand that, we have to go down to the molecular level.

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So this is now the world of Cric and Mono.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What Cric discovered with the double helix structure of DNA

191
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
was that you have a positive and a negative of the same information,

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
which can be split and copied without being used up,

193
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and that's how changes can be passed on from a mother to a daughter

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
when in the case of cells the mother divides.

195
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Now at the same time, either the positive or the negative can be used

196
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
as a source of instructions to control the cell,

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and that's how the hereditary information that's passed down is expressed in us.

198
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But the thing that's important here is this is like a company

199
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
whose commander only gives commands and never listens to feedback.

200
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The only way you know whether they were good ideas or not

201
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
is whether the company lives or dies.

202
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is what implies accident because it says that it's only the accidental changes

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
in the course of living or in the course of dividing

204
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that cause organisms to gradually change,

205
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and then those changes are inherited,

206
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and the only thing that determines what we see today

207
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
is which changes lived and which ones didn't.

208
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
This is Darwin's idea,

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and of course what Cric and Watson recognized

210
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
is that this is the molecular basis

211
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that gives substance to Darwin's empirical observations.

212
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But I'll point out to you here,

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
this is the description of life at the level of control and inheritance.

214
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Of course, if we have a moment of common sense,

215
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
we remember that there's more to life than control.

216
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What I want to do is now broaden the picture,

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
ask what else is in life,

218
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and then start to dig down in a different area that maybe is more fruitful.

219
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What I want to show you here,

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
life is not just one thing.

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's not just one level of structure or just one kind of organization.

222
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's many things and they're all different and they all work together.

223
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Just to give you a lay of the land,

224
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll review what some of them are,

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and then I'll tell you which ones I want to focus on.

226
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
First thing, life lives in the non-living world of rocks in the atmosphere.

227
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In the non-living world, your carbon comes in the form of carbon dioxide molecules mostly.

228
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's what these little stunted butterflies are supposed to be,

229
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
pictures of carbon dioxide.

230
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The first thing life has to do is make carbon-carbon bonds,

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
which it does by making a certain set of small molecules.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There are many of these about 250 and they're not very big,

233
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
between 5 and 20 carbon atoms.

234
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is a whole structure of chemistry that's called core metabolism,

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and that'll be the hero of our story tonight.

236
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But for a moment, let me go on.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You make little atoms one carbon at a time.

238
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When you make big atoms, you do something different.

239
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You stitch the little atoms together like beads on a necklace.

240
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is where you get the big molecules, the DNA and the proteins,

241
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that can have tens or hundreds of thousands of atoms, in some cases even millions.

242
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Of course, that's not all.

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The big molecules have to be physically stuck together to make the structures of cells.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's a different organizational problem.

245
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Now, for some living things, that's as far as it goes,

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
your one cell and that's your life.

247
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
For others, you get many cells that group together to make a plant or an animal.

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's another problem of organization.

249
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
For most of us, we live in an ecosystem where we have relations to all the other organisms.

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's another problem of coordination and organization.

251
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The ecosystems together on the earth feedback and change its basic geological chemistry.

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
All this is going on, these things are very different in their dynamics.

253
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We shouldn't be thinking that one idea of control explains all of them.

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The remarkable thing is, if we look at these things from the perspective of chance and necessity,

255
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
we find that in fact they lay at very different places.

256
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The benchmark for what I'll call necessity is the chemistry of the rocks and the atmosphere and the oceans.

257
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
On any planet like the earth, it's going to be the same.

258
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There's not much that's accidental to it.

259
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's very steady, we can predict what the minerals are and we understand it with our science.

260
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
At the opposite end of this is any individual species.

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The fact that there should happen to have been a large flightless pigeon on Mauritius is an infinite accident.

262
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The fact that it didn't survive unfortunately is the most likely thing.

263
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is Gould's world of contingency.

264
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
All the things that almost never were and never will be again.

265
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Here, of course, they're variable.

266
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
They fluctuate like crazy.

267
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is Doug Irwin's lecture a few months ago on extinctions.

268
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We have a hard time predicting them.

269
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This is Gould, Mono, and Crick, their statements.

270
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Here's what's neat.

271
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Biology is not all piled up against the contingent end.

272
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If I ask about the small molecules here,

273
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
these are almost as steady as the chemistry of the rocks.

274
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The same set of about 250 of them is in every living thing in the world

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and appears to have been the same for all of history, almost four billion years.

276
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So it's like a feature of the geosphere.

277
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
DNA, well, chemically DNA has been around probably since fairly close to the beginning

278
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and RNA even closer than that.

279
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But when this contains instructions for how to make these chemicals,

280
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
the instructions can change all over the place.

281
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The chemicals do not change and the pathways do not change.

282
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So all of a sudden control is looking like maybe it's not the most important thing.

283
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Maybe getting the answer is the important thing

284
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and you have some freedom in how you do it with control.

285
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Cells are fairly regular,

286
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
but there's a significant amount of variability in them over history.

287
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And ecosystems, if I could have drawn them, should cover this entire span

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
because the accidents of how we live together in an ecosystem

289
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
are among the most fragile things that are parts of life.

290
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And yet the chemistry of ecosystems, which is the chemistry of these molecules,

291
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
goes all the way back here to the oldest things we know.

292
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So in fact, if we want to understand the predictable parts of life,

293
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
we should be looking at metabolism as the bridge between the rock chemistry

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and the early stages of life and the part that we can predict.

295
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But in order to do that, we need a science of metabolism

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
which is going to be different from the science of control.

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So let me start back looking at the things that are alive again

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and show you how you would think about their organisation in metabolic terms.

299
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Turns out two questions will answer a huge fraction of what you need to know.

300
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
One is where you get your energy,

301
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and the second is do you depend on other living things for your own survival?

302
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And there are two choices to each.

303
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So biochemistry 101 in 30 seconds.

304
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
All of life is driven by energetic electrons

305
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and the only question about where you get your energy is where you get your electrons.

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
There turn out to be two choices.

307
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There are molecules that release energy by giving electrons away

308
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and the metabolisms that run on that energy are what I call reductive here.

309
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And both of these are of that kind.

310
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And I'll tell you what they are in a minute.

311
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This little guy lives at almost the temperature of boiling water in volcanoes under the deep sea.

312
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is botulism, which when I was a kid was not a cosmetic,

313
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
it was a deadly poison that you tried not to get in your canned goods.

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The other option besides reductive metabolisms are oxidative metabolisms

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
where the energy comes from pulling electrons to the environment.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Oxidative metabolisms are things like the blue-green algae that give the ocean its greenish colour

317
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and everything most people think about life is down in this corner.

318
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The animals, the plants, the fungi, everything big enough to see without a microscope.

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Now here's the interesting thing.

320
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The oxygen in the world that is the foundation for this way of life was produced by living things.

321
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It was not always here.

322
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So this whole way of life didn't exist at the beginning of the world

323
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and didn't exist at significant complexity until quite late,

324
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
probably half of the age of the earth.

325
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Now the other distinction we can make is whether or not you need anything else in the world.

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There are organisms, both of these kinds,

327
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
which basically can do every chemical thing they need in a world with no other living thing.

328
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What a life it must be, especially if you're just one cell,

329
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
you know, no communication, no competition,

330
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
but they can do what none of the rest of us can do.

331
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
These guys are called autotrophs from the Greek roots meaning self-feeding.

332
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The alternative to being an autotroph is to be a heterotroph.

333
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You have to live in an ecology because your own chemistry is incomplete

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and you have to have the ecology providing things for you.

335
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And we, of course, are the ultimate heterotrophs.

336
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We need everything.

337
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But in fact, what I did here was a little bit of a sleight of hand.

338
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I did the thing people always do.

339
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I looked at individual species and individual organisms.

340
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That wasn't the right thing to do.

341
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It turns out to be a distraction.

342
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Because if I look at the ecosystem level,

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
the whole ecology together, things become even simpler.

344
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
By definition, every ecology, because it's self-contained,

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
has to do all of its own chemistry.

346
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So every ecology is autotrophic.

347
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The remarkable thing that you get from studying biochemistry

348
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
is the knowledge that other than this division,

349
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
there's essentially no variability at the ecosystem level

350
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
in the chemistry of life, which means that...

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I mean, this is the Tolstoy quote.

352
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
All autotrophic ecosystems are essentially alike,

353
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
but every heterotrophic organism is heterotrophic in its own way.

354
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
If you are a reductive ecology, like one of these sulfur swamps

355
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that you get in volcanic hot springs,

356
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
then you're living off of electrons that come from the geochemical reactions.

357
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If you're an oxidative ecology, there's a little bit more variability.

358
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You're living ultimately off of energy that comes from sunlight

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and the ability to produce oxygen.

360
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But here's the more remarkable thing.

361
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Chemically, these things look like opposites.

362
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Either the environment gives you electrons where it pulls them in.

363
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It turns out that in the structure of life,

364
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
this is not just an opposition, it's a hierarchy.

365
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Because the universal chemistry that is in these guys

366
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
is a subset of what's in these guys.

367
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oxidative life is reductive life wrapped up in a spacesuit

368
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
that's able to capture sunlight.

369
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So what that means is that even though on the earth today

370
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
there are environments with almost no oxygen

371
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
down in the deep seas around volcanoes

372
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and environments with locks of oxygen,

373
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
like up here where we live,

374
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
you can also look at this as a picture back in time.

375
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because back at the very beginning,

376
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
when there was not yet life to have made oxygen,

377
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the only kind of life there was was the reductive life.

378
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And in these very simple organisms,

379
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
basically building biomass is enough to be alive.

380
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This may have happened as long as almost four billion years ago

381
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
within a couple hundred million years

382
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
of when the ocean stopped boiling off.

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So it basically was a snap of a finger.

384
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It happened as quickly as it could.

385
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Probably somewhat later,

386
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and this is the biggest uncertainty in the talk,

387
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
when this happened is unknown to a billion years or more.

388
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But at some point organisms started to realize

389
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
that there was huge energy in sunlight if they could capture it.

390
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And they started to couple that to building their core metabolism,

391
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and they started producing oxygen.

392
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Took a long time though for the oxygen to build up

393
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and only when there was a lot did you start getting the things

394
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
we think about as life, complex cell forms,

395
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
multi-cell organisms, all that stuff.

396
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Now here's the striking thing.

397
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Oxygen, when it first was introduced, was a waste product.

398
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It was a worst poison for life

399
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
than anything any of us has ever imagined.

400
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And yet this chemistry did not end.

401
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It was preserved and it has been preserved all the way up to the present.

402
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So.

403
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I've just thrown a huge amount of stuff at you in five slides.

404
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I think maybe that's appropriate because life is complicated.

405
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And we said that if we want to avoid the mistakes of the past,

406
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
we don't want to oversimplify by ignoring things at the beginning.

407
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
We want to look at it all,

408
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and then we want to see what looks like it doesn't depend on chance,

409
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
and we want to let universality and stability be our guide.

410
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So we've been able to boil the story down

411
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
to focusing on the core molecules of biochemistry

412
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and what we use to build our own biomass.

413
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So at this point, we're still in the middle of a treasure hunt.

414
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We think we know what we're after, but there hasn't been an aha.

415
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's for the next slide.

416
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But here's the cool thing.

417
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
If you were to watch a movie,

418
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and one of the characters were to open up a treasure map

419
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
that has five arrows pointing to someplace saying,

420
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
here it is, this is it,

421
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you would say, okay, that's not a very subtle movie.

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What kind of a character needs that?

423
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What I'm about to show you is that the map of biochemistry

424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
is a treasure map with five arrows pointing to here it is,

425
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
and it's been known since the 1960s.

426
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But people only started to recognize what they were seeing

427
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
within about the last 25 years.

428
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So this is what is universal about the way we build all of our biomolecules.

429
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Biochemistry itself is not super complicated.

430
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If you ask what we are made of, we're made of five classes of things,

431
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and we know all of them because we have to eat them.

432
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Because you remember I said we're metabolically incomplete.

433
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So we need the fatty acids because otherwise we can't make cells.

434
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's your olive oil.

435
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We need the amino acids, which we know from meringue and marshmallow

436
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
and things like that.

437
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
That's the structure and the enzymes and all that good stuff.

438
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
We need sugars.

439
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Turns out they're probably more important for structure

440
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
than they are for energy storage, but we like them for the other thing.

441
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Very, very important set of about 20 to 30 little molecules

442
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
which do all of our sort of super fine chemistry.

443
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Like the chlorophyll that allows plants to capture sunlight

444
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
or the heme that allows us to do respiration.

445
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And then of course there are the nucleic acids, the molecules of heredity.

446
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Now there are 250 or 300 basic molecules that these are built up from.

447
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But here is the kicker.

448
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Every molecule in every living thing in all the world for all time

449
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
has been synthesized from one of these 11 molecules in this cycle.

450
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Now when we were in high school a lot of us were taught about the Krebs cycle.

451
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And of course there was the million dollar, billion dollar point here

452
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
which was ignored and something of almost no importance that we were told.

453
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We were told that the Krebs cycle is important because we use it to break down sugars to get energy.

454
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The Krebs cycle is important because everything in the entire history of life

455
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
has used it as the starting point to build every biomolecule.

456
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
No exceptions.

457
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We came along 2.5 billion, well single cells came along 2.5 billion years later

458
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and used it to get energy.

459
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But we're borrowers in that sense.

460
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So it may be obvious now that I think this is where life started

461
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
but now that we have this chemical framework I can also tell you why

462
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think life had to start this way.

463
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Which is a question that we can ask in chemistry in a way that we could not before.

464
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So in biology the struggle has always been when you think in terms of control

465
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
how do you explain why something is there?

466
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Because when we think why is something there we always think what is it good for?

467
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Well what is it good for is a purpose based question

468
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and it's not clear that it came up because it was good for anything.

469
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It came up for a different reason.

470
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
In chemistry we're not so susceptible to that error

471
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
because in chemistry we're used to saying what was it getting away from?

472
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So a new way to ask about why life emerged is to say what was wrong with a non-living earth?

473
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What was so wrong that could have driven it to have to change

474
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and why was that change in the direction that led toward life?

475
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And that's the thing that I think we can answer

476
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
or that we can at least pose good questions to that are testable in the laboratory.

477
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So that's what I'll tell you about in what's left.

478
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Turns out what we appeal to for understanding is the thing that's the most familiar of all.

479
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
If you put enough stress on something it will break.

480
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And it turns out that the essential math and also the essential intuition I care about

481
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
for the origin of life is the intuition of breakdown.

482
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Now the thing that might be non or sort of counterintuitive

483
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
if you've been wondering about the origin of life

484
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
you don't normally think of the origin of life as the breaking of a lifeless earth.

485
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So the two things that I have to show you is there's more than one way for things to break down

486
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and then second sometimes the process of breakdown is a process of creating new structure

487
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and creating accident where there was only formlessness before.

488
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But you'll be surprised as familiar as crack propagation is to us

489
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
these other two facts about breakdown are equally familiar.

490
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
One of them we know all the time

491
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
because lightning of course is a breakdown of the atmosphere.

492
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's not a mechanical breakdown but instead it's an electrical breakdown.

493
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The thing that we need if we want to understand why life emerged

494
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
is to understand where the stress came from

495
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and why it results in one kind of breakdown instead of another.

496
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So if you want to understand lightning you say

497
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
that storm systems pull charges apart between the clouds and the ground

498
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and that creates an electrical stress for the charges to try to recombine.

499
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The ordinary dry atmosphere which is the preferred configuration

500
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
can't do that transport but the creation of the plasma channel of the lightning bolt

501
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
can do that transport and that's what sustains the plasma channel.

502
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Now we can't predict exactly the track it will take, that's contingent, that's accidental

503
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
but we can very well predict the chemistry of this plasma channel.

504
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So the analogy here and it's better than an analogy, it's a scientific equivalence

505
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
is that our biochemistry is like the altered state that is the plasma channel

506
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
within the lightning bolt and it was driven into existence in something like the same way.

507
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Now lightning is not an ideal example here because it's gone in a short time

508
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
and we don't think of it as lasting for very long

509
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
even though on the scale of the processes that make it it's plenty long lived.

510
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But there are other examples.

511
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Hurricanes are another kind of a breakdown of the atmosphere.

512
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
This is not a breakdown of the electrical structure of the atmosphere,

513
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
it's a breakdown of the thermal structure.

514
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What I'm showing you here is a set of hurricane tracks

515
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
which you can see transporting heat out of the tropical oceans

516
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and into the temperate and polar upper atmospheres.

517
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
This is what drives the hurricane system as of course people now understand

518
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and appreciate in a way that they did in a little while back.

519
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This is a channel that has the ability to pull in heat

520
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
in order to reinforce its own structure

521
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and the wall storms of the hurricane are transporting that heat from the ocean to the upper atmosphere.

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But in order to do that they have to break the smooth layered structure

523
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that the atmospheric temperature usually has.

524
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So if we want to understand the emergence of life, was it a chemical breakdown,

525
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
what we have to ask is where did that happen

526
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and what was the stress that would have caused it to happen.

527
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And now we're talking about stress in a chemical sense.

528
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So my good friend and colleague Harold Morowitz,

529
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
who is much older than I, also has an infinite gift for words.

530
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And he has recognized, that's why he's written something like eight or nine books

531
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
that are revered around the world and I recommend any of them to you.

532
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But he's recognized that theories of the origin of life can be divided into two categories.

533
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
There are the heaven theories and the hell theories.

534
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You can already guess which one I'll like.

535
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But it turns out that this has a basis.

536
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
They're distinguished according to where the energy comes from

537
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
in the life forms that use it today.

538
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
The heaven theories are all of the theories

539
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
whose energy ultimately comes from sunlight or starlight.

540
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The idea is that there's so much energy in this

541
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that it can do the chemistry of forming carbon-carbon bonds.

542
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So it can produce the small molecules.

543
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
This can happen on the surfaces of asteroids, which then fall on the earth.

544
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It can happen in the ices of comets.

545
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
In some small amount, the sunlight drives the weather system

546
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and a little bit of the energy from weather winds up in the lightning bolt

547
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and that can do a little bit of chemistry.

548
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
This was what the Miller-Urey experiment showed

549
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that was so exciting to people

550
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and that got the origin of life started as a scientific question.

551
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And all of these stories that have to do with this sort of sunlight-yielded chemistry

552
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
are the things that we associate with the primordial soup.

553
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Now, this appealed to people when there was no other idea in town,

554
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
but there are a lot of problems with it.

555
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Sunlight is a tremendous energy source,

556
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
but it's not easy to use because it tends to destroy things.

557
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And so, in fact, it's much easier to understand the way sunlight is used today

558
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
if that happens somewhat later on when there was already life in place

559
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
with the complexity to capture it.

560
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Another problem with the primordial soup is that you need to finish life

561
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
before the soup is done, so you're on the clock.

562
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
The idea is that, in the classical scenarios,

563
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
heaven deposits organic materials on the surface of the ocean

564
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and accidental chemistry gives you a control mechanism

565
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and then you have the keys to life itself, the DNA or whatever,

566
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
but then you have to build the whole life underneath of this

567
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
before you have used all of the soup.

568
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So, that's unappealing.

569
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The thing that, to me, is the biggest problem with these ideas

570
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
is that, in this chemistry,

571
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
there's no special place for the biochemistry we see,

572
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
and there's no special reason to exclude all of the things

573
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that are not in our biochemistry.

574
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So, it's not clear to me that this is very tightly coupled to who we are.

575
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And since the whole point of exploring biochemistry

576
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
was that that was the thing to be explained,

577
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I think we should expect a coupling.

578
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And that's where the hell theory comes in.

579
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
This is the theory, particularly associated with hydrothermal vents.

580
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
These can be volcanoes, but they can be quieter things

581
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that involve magma and water under the deep ocean.

582
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
There can be many different kinds.

583
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You can have these guys which are alkaline

584
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and which are full of carbon dioxide, but not too much metal.

585
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
These are called white smokers,

586
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and they occur in not the hottest places.

587
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
These are about at the boiling temperature of water a little bit cooler.

588
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
These guys can be 600 degrees Fahrenheit

589
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
or 300 degrees Celsius, roughly,

590
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and they thunder along at the bottom of the ocean.

591
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
They're black because they're full of metal and sulfur.

592
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
They're full of carbon dioxide. They're full of hydrogen.

593
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
In particular, they're full of all of the chemicals

594
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that life needs to exist,

595
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
but they are not full of primordial soup.

596
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And oddly enough, that turns out to be an advantage.

597
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And I'll show you why in the next slide.

598
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, I should mention to you

599
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
that there are whole ecosystems that live down here.

600
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The little grey guy that I told you can live all by itself

601
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
with no other living thing.

602
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They live down here in this range,

603
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and they do exactly the chemistry I'm going to tell you

604
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I think was being done four billion years ago

605
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
before there was life.

606
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
If you want to understand what was wrong with a lifeless earth,

607
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
then you say what was the problem.

608
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Here's the problem.

609
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The geochemistry creates carbon dioxide,

610
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and it creates hydrogen.

611
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Now, hydrogen has electrons

612
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that it can give to carbon or oxygen,

613
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and if it were to give them,

614
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
so you put as many hydrogens as will fit around a carbon

615
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
to make methane,

616
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
you put as many hydrogens as will fit around an oxygen

617
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
to make water,

618
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
that is the most energy that's available from this system.

619
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You look at this picture and you say,

620
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
well, how hard could it be?

621
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Well, it turns out it's very hard.

622
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's harder than any non-living thing

623
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
can do at an appreciable rate,

624
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
but living things do it with superb efficiency.

625
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So what life on earth is today doing,

626
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
among other things,

627
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
these geochemical processes

628
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
are generating all this energetic stuff,

629
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
but it would build up and build up and build up

630
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
in the absence of life.

631
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Life consumes it, provides this downhill run

632
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
to lower energy molecules.

633
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So the idea behind the lightning strike

634
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
is that this stress, when there was no life,

635
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
built up and built up

636
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and created a lightning strike through chemistry

637
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
to make this possible.

638
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But what does that have to do with biochemistry?

639
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
All I showed you was carbon dioxide and methane.

640
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Here's a surprising thing that's a little different

641
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
than we're used to thinking of.

642
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I told you that there are organisms that live

643
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
in these hydrogen environments,

644
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
the reducing environments that give electrons.

645
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They're doing this chemistry

646
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and they have essentially nothing more than biosynthesis.

647
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Their energy capture is very limited.

648
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's much less than a tenth of what any of us

649
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
use up in the air-breathing world.

650
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
The surprising thing is that in order to get from here to here,

651
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
the best way is to go through the molecules of life.

652
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So what this picture is, you can think of this

653
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
as being the chemical equivalent of a ball rolling down a hill

654
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and it has the same mathematical meaning.

655
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
What I'm showing you here is the starting point

656
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
when no chemistry has been done,

657
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the ending point when all of the energy has been extracted,

658
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and across here is how far you've gone

659
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
in transferring those hydrogens.

660
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It turns out that there are no ways through little molecules

661
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
to go from here to here that are as energy efficient and simple

662
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
as going through these molecules,

663
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
which are the ones in the cycle I showed you.

664
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You don't need to worry about the names,

665
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
but if you want to know why is there sugar,

666
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
there's sugar because sugar is downhill from the stuff that makes sugar.

667
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
If you want to understand why there's oil, including petroleum,

668
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
it's because oil is on the way to methane

669
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
if you have enough hydrogen to make it.

670
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And so what I'm telling you, the chemistry was doing here,

671
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
is exactly what these little guys are doing

672
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
at the base of that hydrothermal vent that I showed you.

673
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Incidentally, if I had remembered to point it out on the tree,

674
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
you remember that some of the organisms seem to connect in

675
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
very, very close to the root.

676
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Unlike us, we're kind of connected way out here in the leaves.

677
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This is one of them.

678
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
This connects all the way down at the bottom.

679
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Lives a few degrees below the boiling temperature of water.

680
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Seems to have ancestors that could be at least 3 billion years old

681
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
before it has a common ancestry with anything else.

682
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Does this simple chemistry is completely self-contained

683
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and does nothing else?

684
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So this is the kind of model we're looking at

685
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
for the chemistry of the origin of life.

686
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Now, you shouldn't believe me yet,

687
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
even if you might believe me in a minute,

688
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
because I just told you that all of this chemistry is hard.

689
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So where did any of this stuff come from if it's so hard to do?

690
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And that's what's special about the cycle at the core of biochemistry

691
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
with all the arrows pointing to it.

692
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Because that cycle is the chemical equivalent of the hurricane.

693
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So here's the cycle again.

694
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I didn't know how to show it to you

695
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
without making it sort of sleep inducing.

696
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But this is actually the chemical diagram

697
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
showing where carbon dioxide's come in,

698
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
where hydrogen's come in, where waters are given off,

699
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and so on, and we go round and round the cycle.

700
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And we go around it in this picture the same way

701
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
as the hurricane goes around it.

702
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
By the way, if you have kids in school

703
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and they come home telling you that the Krebs cycle

704
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
is the citric acid cycle,

705
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
tell them, wait till they grow up.

706
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Because this thing is called by some people

707
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the reverse citric acid cycle.

708
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
This is the real citric acid cycle.

709
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
This was here 4 billion years ago.

710
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We run the reverse citric acid cycle.

711
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That came along only when there was oxygen much later.

712
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But the important thing about this cycle is this.

713
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The chemistry of these molecules

714
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
is chemistry that's like flypaper.

715
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's suited to take in a carbon dioxide or a hydrogen

716
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
even if they couldn't react with each other.

717
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And so as you go around the cycle,

718
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
the molecules get bigger and bigger

719
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and bigger as they take in carbon.

720
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And then when they get here, they split.

721
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And you get two molecules where before you had one.

722
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So now you can take in twice as much carbon.

723
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And it splits again.

724
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And now you can take in four times as much carbon.

725
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So this is like compound interest.

726
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Or like the chain reaction that was, of course,

727
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
made famous by Los Alamos some decades ago.

728
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Or the hair commercial where she told two people

729
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and so on and so on.

730
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
The thing that's important about these kinds of cycles is

731
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
that even if you have only a very rare event

732
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
to form one of these molecules,

733
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
if you have self-amplification,

734
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
that can cause all of your carbon

735
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and all of your energy flow

736
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
to get sucked into one cycle.

737
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Just like you never find two hurricanes

738
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
in exactly the same place,

739
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
because any one of them is pulling all of the local energy in

740
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
from the ocean where it is.

741
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So that's pretty much the story.

742
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm not going to tell you that all of it is fact,

743
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
that all of it's established,

744
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
but all of it is experimentally testable.

745
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And there are several things that I think it allows us to think

746
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
that are different than have been thought before,

747
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
probably more common sense and maybe more useful.

748
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Metabolism first, not control first.

749
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Control is complicated if it had to come on a background of nothing

750
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
that would seem like almost a miracle,

751
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
but it doesn't exist on a background of almost nothing today.

752
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It exists on a background of metabolism,

753
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
and metabolism is old.

754
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Life arose and persists in order to enable metabolism.

755
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
This is the lightning strike argument.

756
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Think about how different this is

757
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
than the way we usually think.

758
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We usually think that metabolism exists in order to enable life.

759
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That's the sort of purpose-oriented thinking.

760
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
In the chemical domain,

761
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
you get a completely different idea of what life even is.

762
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Life is what can be built out of those 11 molecules

763
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
when you have this amplifying cycle

764
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
spewing them out from geochemistry.

765
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
We get, to me, the very pleasing idea

766
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
that the emergence of life was a form of collapse.

767
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The important thing about this is

768
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
that things do not come up off of the floor

769
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
and rearrange themselves on the table.

770
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So if the transition from a non-living to a living earth

771
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
was actually a collapse,

772
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that enables us to understand why life has been so stable.

773
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Species go extinct, ecosystems rearrange.

774
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Life has never winked out.

775
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's been continuous all the way back,

776
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and the chemistry has been invariant.

777
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
This is a sensible way to look at that.

778
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Of course, most of all,

779
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
the biosphere is no longer separate from the geosphere,

780
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
not in our thinking, not in our science.

781
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Geochemistry is, in some sense,

782
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the core of what we are and have always been.

783
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
The rest of us as living things is built around it.

784
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
There's contingency that comes in later.

785
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
There's all kinds of room for accident,

786
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
but this accident comes in

787
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
once there's a significant amount of structure already in place.

788
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Thank you, and it'll be good to talk.

789
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
APPLAUSE

790
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The first question is,

791
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
why do we not find it spontaneously emerging

792
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
in the remote parts of the world?

793
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
If the absence of life in those remote parts of the world

794
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
is explained by competition with existing forms of life,

795
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
which is the more common explanation,

796
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
then why is it so hard in a laboratory

797
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and of highly idealised conditions to synthesise life?

798
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Cool. Yeah, good. All good.

799
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So the answer to the first question

800
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
is a thing that even Darwin had already recognised,

801
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
that in some sense,

802
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
when you have very modern forms that are very sophisticated,

803
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
it's difficult for the things that gave rise to those modern forms

804
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
to be recreated.

805
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So for instance,

806
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm trying to think of something in the technological realm,

807
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
if there's some tremendous amount of effort

808
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
that's required to make the first digital computer,

809
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and it's as big as this room and uses as much electricity as a city,

810
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and then you have that thing sitting over there on the desk.

811
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
People would not be willing to go through the same effort

812
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
to do the same difficult thing again,

813
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
once the efficient things are already there.

814
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So I should be careful.

815
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
What you said the first time seems to be exactly right,

816
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
that we have never found any place where the process

817
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
of the emergence of life is being repeated,

818
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
but the second thing,

819
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
we've never found any place in the earth

820
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
that doesn't have something living there.

821
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So you drill down as deep as you can in an oil well,

822
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and you'll find bacteria and archaea living down there.

823
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You go up into arctic ices, they're there.

824
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Up in the atmosphere, they're up there feeding off dust particles.

825
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So in some sense, anywhere there's energy in the world,

826
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
something is already grazing on it.

827
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And I think most people do not expect

828
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
any catastrophic surprises in that area.

829
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
They think that we don't see the emergence of life again,

830
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
because current life is so much more efficient.

831
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But then the question about the lab

832
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
really is pertinent to what we do.

833
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And so the interesting thing is that

834
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
not only is life complex, but the geological world is complex.

835
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And so here's the best thing we can do in the lab.

836
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
There are probably three guys in the United States

837
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
who can do it, and I'm privileged to be sort of

838
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
on the doorstep of one of them asking for what he knows.

839
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
You can take a fantastically expensive machine

840
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
that took you most of your career to build.

841
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You can put a little bit of chemistry into a gold capsule.

842
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You can seal it.

843
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You can compress it to 300 atmospheres

844
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and heat it to 200 degrees.

845
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And then you can take it out and very carefully open it

846
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
and find out what happened.

847
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And if you don't have the chemistry exactly right,

848
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
you can start over.

849
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So compare that to what was happening in the early earth.

850
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
In the early earth, the mantle was more fluid,

851
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and so there probably were no lasting continents.

852
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It was constantly fractured.

853
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The moon was as big as a dinner plate in the sky,

854
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
and the tides were once every six hours

855
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and probably two kilometers high.

856
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
The entire ocean probably got cycled

857
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
through these hydrothermal systems

858
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
on the order of once every 1,000 years,

859
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
whereas today it's more like once every 100,000 years.

860
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And I told you that there were two of these systems today

861
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
that are sort of separate and sort of different

862
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
with their unrelated chemistry.

863
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
One is alkaline, one is acid, one has low metals,

864
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
one has high metals.

865
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
In the early earth, the entire upper crust

866
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
was probably fractured with the ocean

867
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
infecting through it.

868
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And the chemistry at that time

869
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
could have been any mix of any of these things.

870
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So if we want to understand and recreate correctly

871
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
in the lab this organic chemistry,

872
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
we have to understand what type of chemical environment

873
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
we're looking in.

874
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And that turns out to be a really hard search problem.

875
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Works better if you have the entire crust of the earth

876
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
than if you have a little gold capsule

877
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
that holds less than this much of my finger of a liquid.

878
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But I am hoping that I will live to see these experiments done.

879
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I should tell you that for the citric acid,

880
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
the Krebs cycle that I showed you,

881
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
George Cody and Carnegie Institution in Washington

882
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
has already gotten big arcs of this cycle to go

883
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
even with his little capsule.

884
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And so the question is whether at the places

885
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
where things are not working,

886
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
we're missing something about the mineral chemistry.

887
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And I think that that's probably the case

888
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and that it will probably be cracked.

889
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
OK.

890
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So here's the next one.

891
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It's probably the question that is maybe of greatest interest

892
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
to the most people.

893
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And that is where does the inevitability end, right?

894
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So in your spectrum, you know,

895
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
it would be a sort of rather disappointing take-home message

896
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
of inevitable life was basically the inevitability

897
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
of a bunch of small molecules.

898
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And so the question is,

899
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
is there some possibility of identifying other regularities

900
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and other processes that would make

901
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
more sophisticated, more complex structures inevitable too?

902
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So, for example, you know, we watched Star Trek

903
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
and we encountered bipedal self-conscious extraterrestrials.

904
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Are we going to be forever disappointed

905
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
and only ever encounter, you know, the Krebs cycle?

906
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Or is there something about the theory,

907
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
or some theory that might be related to it,

908
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that would say that more complex structures

909
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
would be inevitable too?

910
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Wonderful. Yep.

911
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So, of course, this is in some ways a disingenuous question

912
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
because this is what David and I work on together.

913
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And this is also what Jeffrey West at the Institute works on.

914
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
We think there are all kinds of things that are very lawful

915
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
and that can only happen in more or less the way they do

916
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
at all kinds of structures throughout life.

917
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I'll tell you about a couple in our work,

918
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
but I'll tell you about a couple others that are obvious

919
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
that are just kind of common knowledge.

920
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
All fish look more or less like fish,

921
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
and that's because they live in water.

922
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It's out that if you look at diatoms,

923
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
these little tiny glass-encased things that are one or a few cells,

924
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
they don't look like fish at all,

925
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
but that's because they live at low Reynolds number.

926
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And if you're a fluid mechanic and you look at diatoms,

927
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
they actually look all like each other,

928
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
sort of like snowflakes look like each other.

929
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So, in some sense, there are rules that make fish fish

930
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and that make diatoms diatoms.

931
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Now, I didn't tell you much about what goes on at the chemistry

932
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
above this very basic cycle,

933
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
but I think that we will be able to show

934
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
that maybe 14 or 15 of the 20 amino acids that we use

935
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
had to be either as they are or somewhere pretty close,

936
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
because it turns out that they are the easiest chemistry

937
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
to do from these carbon backbones.

938
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
We think that a lot of the regularity that's in our genetic code

939
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
turns out to have had a chemical origin in the era

940
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
before there were cells, before there was any coding,

941
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and that that probably is predictable.

942
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Of course, Geoffrey's work on allymetric scaling says,

943
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
if you want to become multicellular and you have to feed yourself,

944
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
there are limits on how you can do that,

945
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and that's why you do not have flying elephants

946
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
or little hummingbirds that live 100 years.

947
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And so there are lots of regularities,

948
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and the lovely thing is, like the structures of life,

949
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
they are not all alike.

950
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
They're very different, and they each come at different scales,

951
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and yet once you stitch them all together,

952
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
a lot of times there's kind of a skeleton of regularity

953
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and there's sense to the variations and the accidents

954
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
that can live around them.

955
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Those things and necessity are not things that are separated by a gulf.

956
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
They're things that are constantly sort of interleaved.

957
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So is that?

958
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Good, yes.

959
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So why don't we take some questions now from the audience?

960
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
There's one here, yes.

961
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Have any of the cornology that's been found in our explorations

962
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
of the moon and Mars?

963
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
No.

964
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
We haven't looked for them in Mars,

965
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
but here's a point that maybe I could have made better in the talk.

966
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
When I say that we are coupled to the geosphere,

967
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
we really are coupled to the energy of the geosphere,

968
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
because having carbon and having nitrogen or oxygen or phosphorus or sulphur

969
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
is not enough to give you life.

970
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You have to have an energy source that forces it to exist,

971
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and the moon is a very low energy place,

972
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and today even Mars is a very low energy place.

973
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The moons of Jupiter are not low energy places.

974
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
They may be chemically different places from the earth,

975
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
but it's kind of like Alice in Wonderland.

976
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It takes all the running you can do just to stay in place.

977
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
You'll have to run a lot harder than that to get anywhere.

978
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It's taken all we can do to understand the chemistry that's in the life we know.

979
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
If the chemistry of the planet or the moon is different on Europa or on Titan,

980
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
it may turn out to be an equally hard problem where we don't have clues

981
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
to understand what we should look for there.

982
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
But if you can find me a planet whose rocks are like the earth,

983
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and it comes from a second-generation star,

984
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
it's about at the same distance,

985
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I will certainly go there looking for vinegar,

986
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and looking for malic acid and citric acid,

987
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and all these other good things that are even familiar.

988
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
They're so common.

989
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, there's a question back there.

990
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You may have answered this in his second question,

991
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
but in your tree of life,

992
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
everything went down in this root of the tree.

993
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's my understanding, and I'm not in this field,

994
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
that even in that trunk of the tree,

995
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
biologists presume that there's DNA, there's control,

996
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
even in our trunk.

997
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So it must have happened very early,

998
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
as what you're saying, not as early as this,

999
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
but is DNA still in other places?

1000
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
If we do find the predacypal on another planet,

1001
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
are we going to find DNA on that planet?

1002
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I don't know about DNA.

1003
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I would bet more than 50 cents on RNA.

1004
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Depending on how many trillion dollars it costs us to go there,

1005
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
then there's a question how much you would bet on RNA.

1006
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You have it exactly right,

1007
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and you raise two really important points,

1008
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
because the oldest thing you can trace with a family tree

1009
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
is a thing that has a structure of control.

1010
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So anything that happens before the structure of control,

1011
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
even if it had a long time to happen,

1012
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
the family tree will not enable you to know about,

1013
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
because there was nothing to preserve those family resemblances.

1014
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Now, interesting thing,

1015
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
DNA is really good for what it does,

1016
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and RNA is not so good for the things DNA does,

1017
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
and there's a lot of chemical sense in DNA.

1018
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And it's interesting, it turns out that the sugar in DNA

1019
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
is not very hard for an organic chemist to make

1020
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
from some of the chemicals that I showed you there,

1021
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
but that's not the way it's made in any living thing.

1022
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
In every living thing, it's made from the sugar in RNA

1023
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
via a much more complicated, difficult reaction.

1024
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I think what that tells us is that RNA was certainly there,

1025
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
whether it was there a little before,

1026
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
or a little after there were cells,

1027
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
is a hard problem to be worked out,

1028
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and I would believe either one of those with a good argument.

1029
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
DNA may have come, interesting possibility,

1030
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
on the tree DNA could have come after the first branching.

1031
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
There are some people who believe it did,

1032
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
because the molecules that make, that copy DNA,

1033
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
look to have been independently derived twice.

1034
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So it could be that, at the root,

1035
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
there was actually an RNA organism,

1036
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and DNA was discovered for its value twice.

1037
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
There's a question here.

1038
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yeah.

1039
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
My main recollection of the prep cycle

1040
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:24,000
is that there are quite a few enzymes that they can go.

1041
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
What about that?

1042
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
That's the other wonderful part of the story

1043
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
that, if I had been a chemist, I would have told you

1044
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
instead of the story I told you today.

1045
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
The enzymes in modern cells are so efficient.

1046
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
They can increase the rate of reaction by millions,

1047
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
or as much as hundreds of millions of times.

1048
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Now, there also tends to hundreds of thousands of atoms long,

1049
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
so they probably didn't exist.

1050
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Because they're so good, and it's been so much work

1051
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
to understand how they work,

1052
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
almost all of our focus on catalysis

1053
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
has focused on these very big, very sophisticated,

1054
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and relatively late molecules.

1055
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
A thing that is now being discovered,

1056
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
but needs to be much more explored,

1057
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
is that small molecules can also be catalysts.

1058
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
They're not nearly as good,

1059
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
but they're also not nearly as hard to make.

1060
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And not only small molecules can be catalysts,

1061
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
but mineral surfaces can be catalysts.

1062
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The people who know this better than anybody

1063
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
are the petroleum engineers,

1064
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
because they're the ones who use it to convert the grades

1065
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
of gasoline and diesel and all that stuff.

1066
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And this is another place where there are tremendous fossils.

1067
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Much of the mineral chemistry that's good for hydrocracking

1068
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
involves iron, sulfur, cobalt, and molybdenum,

1069
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
some part of that is preserved in the enzymes

1070
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
as the actual active site that either moves an electron

1071
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
or moves a functional group.

1072
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And so, if we want to understand where the structure

1073
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
to the chemistry came from and we need catalysis,

1074
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
the place we need to look is in the small molecules themselves.

1075
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Starting with the minerals,

1076
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
what can be done on the surfaces of exposed rock,

1077
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
when those make small molecules,

1078
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
what catalytic capabilities do those perform?

1079
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
A few experiments have been done

1080
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
with showing that every one of the amino acids

1081
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
is catalytic for certain reactions that will make sugar.

1082
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And they're specific.

1083
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
They not only enhance the rates,

1084
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
but they do it in different ways for different molecules.

1085
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So this is a whole field of organic chemistry

1086
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
that doesn't yet exist,

1087
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
just because people haven't put a priority onto doing it.

1088
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But I hope that that's a thing

1089
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
that within a small number of years

1090
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
will become an active area of work.

1091
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
There's a question behind you.

1092
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
That, yes, you know.

1093
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
A great volume of something up on the internet

1094
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
of a supplementary researcher,

1095
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
he said, was playing that

1096
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
beings aren't dying in California

1097
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
due to the genetic of modified organisms.

1098
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And that this person also claims

1099
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
that this molecular interference

1100
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
can have potential to destroy life

1101
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
within six years.

1102
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Three-fourth that. Have you heard anything about this?

1103
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I heard something about cell phones

1104
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
causing the colony disruption of bees.

1105
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Happily that's not an area

1106
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
that it's my responsibility

1107
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
to provide reliable answers on.

1108
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You got to appreciate that the stuff I'm doing

1109
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
is simple enough that a physicist can understand it.

1110
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And the kind of questions that you're asking

1111
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
are at such a higher level of complexity,

1112
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I don't really have the right tools

1113
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
to address those kinds of questions,

1114
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
because they're in the domain of accident.

1115
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And that's one of the things we work on

1116
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
is how really do you think about a science

1117
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
where history is an important part.

1118
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Have you heard of the...

1119
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yes.

1120
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yes, they have been here in the past.

1121
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
They were only bigger and stronger than they are today.

1122
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Any given one might only last for a thousand years

1123
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
or 10,000 years,

1124
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and then it dries up and a different one goes someplace else.

1125
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
But I didn't mention this about the heaven and the hell theories.

1126
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
The heaven theory turns out to come from nuclear fusion,

1127
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
because that's what powers stars.

1128
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
The hell theories come from nuclear fission,

1129
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
because that's what keeps the inside of the planet hot.

1130
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And it's the process of getting rid of that excess heat

1131
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
that causes the planet to convert heat energy into chemical energy.

1132
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And that's what's driving these things.

1133
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
That's why there's a steady rich source of chemistry at those

1134
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
that there may not be on the surface.

1135
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I'm going to take two more questions.

1136
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes.

1137
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You bet. You bet.

1138
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
You know why?

1139
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Because there wasn't a self back then.

1140
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
And that, to me, is one of the most important things

1141
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
that should revise our understanding of biology.

1142
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The Darwinian Revolution took for granted

1143
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
that we know what individuals are on the planet.

1144
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
We know what individuals are on the planet.

1145
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
We know what people are on the planet.

1146
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
We know what people are on the planet.

1147
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
We know what people are on the planet.

1148
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We know what people are on the planet.

1149
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
We know for granted that we know what individuals are.

1150
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And that we know what it means for an individual to have offspring.

1151
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But in thermodynamics there are no individuals.

1152
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And so there's a big question.

1153
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Is the Darwinian dynamics of life completely unrelated

1154
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
to the things we understand?

1155
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Or in fact should we recognize that Darwinian dynamics

1156
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
come into existence when individuals come into existence

1157
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
and that there is a dynamic before that

1158
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that continues all the way back

1159
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
and becomes part of the physics?

1160
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So in fact what I want to say is

1161
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
you start with the geochemistry.

1162
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
You have an ordered geochemistry

1163
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
which is the seeds of biochemistry

1164
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
but there are not individuals yet.

1165
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
From biochemistry you get cells

1166
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
because they're the best way

1167
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
to make biochemistry happen

1168
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
and you get the chemistry of ecosystems

1169
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
but still there are no stable individuals.

1170
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Later, later, later

1171
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
when it becomes possible to specialize

1172
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
it starts to become worthwhile

1173
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
to have an individuality that persists.

1174
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And then the dynamics that we've all heard of from Darwin

1175
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
starts to become important

1176
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and that's also where accident starts to become important

1177
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
and where family trees begin to show up.

1178
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So there's a lovely continuity that goes back

1179
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
but to me it's wonderful.

1180
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
We don't have to take the self for granted anymore.

1181
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It can be a concept that it is the responsibility of science to derive.

1182
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So let's have

1183
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
there's one right in front here.

1184
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
It's a final question.

1185
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Well I know there are a lot of experiments

1186
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
that have been done with computer simulations

1187
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
of evolution.

1188
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So this must be very exciting

1189
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
to me.

1190
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
We'd like to create a toy model

1191
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
and run it through a computer network

1192
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
to see whether a simplified version

1193
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
of 11 simple chemicals

1194
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
that are descending energy

1195
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
train what's involved in this

1196
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
something.

1197
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The devil here is in the details.

1198
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Right.

1199
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So this is a place where there's been too much of a gap

1200
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
and this time I'll throw mud at the physicists.

1201
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
The physicists have stayed with problems

1202
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
that in some sense are simpler

1203
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
than chemistry

1204
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
because the physicists want to say

1205
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
assume a carbon atom is a sphere.

1206
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Assume a nitrogen atom is also a sphere of the same kind.

1207
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
A nitrogen atom is not the same as a carbon atom.

1208
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
What we need to do

1209
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
at the institute and more broadly

1210
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
is to drag physics forward

1211
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and say okay

1212
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
what do all of these ideas

1213
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
of dynamics look like

1214
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
when you have the structure of chemistry

1215
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
where carbon really is different from nitrogen

1216
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and the differences matter.

1217
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
But that is exactly the kind of experiment

1218
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
that we and colleagues are trying to do

1219
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
one little baby step at a time.

1220
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Right. Thanks Eric.

1221
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Okay.

1222
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Thank you.
