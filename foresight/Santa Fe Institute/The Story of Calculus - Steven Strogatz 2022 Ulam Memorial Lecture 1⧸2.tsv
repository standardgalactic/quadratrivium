276560	278760	..something you tried to abandon decades ago,
278800	281600	I suppose you'd come back for it, it's fantastic.
281640	285160	Many of you know Steve from his New York Times column,
286400	287800	his blog about mathematics,
287840	292520	where he showed how mathematics was essentially, in our modern world, ambiant.
292560	295560	It's part of the culture that we live in.

323700	325460	That's what I learnt in that article...
325700	329980	...which was again as a reassuring for me that it wasn't that exciting.
330300	335260	In connection to SFI and complexity science more generally...
336100	339620	...Stefa'n cwednaeth yw laint cyrdourfos copied toad.
339860	341980	He coauthored in 1998...
342180	344900	...i nebryd o ond차f posts i�l ifancs.
345100	347180	I'm sure many of you have heard.
347580	351540	At the result of Steve and Duncan Watts' article.
351540	356260	was one of our early postdocs, actually, after he'd finished working with Steve.
356260	360740	And this is one of the foundational papers in network science.
360740	366340	It built on sociological research and it added modern techniques of non-linear dynamics
366340	371260	and statistical physics and really revolutionized how we do a whole range of different sciences
371260	376620	now from sociology to network science in the internet.
376620	381900	Steve is also the author of several books that I'm sure some of you purchased up front.
381900	387300	So he writes both for technical audiences and for popular audiences and does so extremely well.
387300	393340	His book on non-linear dynamics and chaos from 1994 is a completely standard textbook
393340	396460	that many of us used in learning the field.
396460	401900	But he also wrote popular books like Sink, The Joy of X and Infinite Powers.
401900	404380	Will it be for sale still after the lecture?
404380	404900	Tomorrow.
404900	410220	OK, tomorrow night if you haven't bought a copy and go ahead and sign it.
410220	415060	So these lectures are the Stan Ulam Memorial Lectures.
415060	424500	And Stan Ulam was a mathematician who also wrote a popular book called Adventures of a Mathematician.
424500	426420	Stan was born in Poland.
426420	431020	He worked in Princeton, Harvard, Madison before coming to Los Alamos.
431100	435380	Steve shares Harvard and Princeton with Stan.
435380	442900	And in that book, Stan Ulam writes, theoretical physics, meaning mathematical physics,
442900	449940	is possible because there are many identical or nearly identical copies of objects and situations.
449940	452180	Science would not be possible.
452180	459460	Physics would not be conceivable if there was not this similarity or identity of vast numbers of points
459460	463500	or subsets or groups of points in the universe.
463500	468540	And Steve's work on networks and dynamical systems more generally
468540	472940	have revealed how in complex systems, which are full of particularities,
472940	479180	you find these kinds of universalities that even in the world of biological life,
479180	482780	there are universalities not unlike those that we observe in physics.
482780	486340	So join me in welcoming Steve to give the first of two Ulam Lectures.
490260	497100	Well, thank you very much, David, and thanks to all of you for coming out tonight.
497100	502700	Thank you too for our online audience on Zoom or on YouTube.
502700	507380	It's really, wow, what a big treat it is to be here speaking to you tonight.
507380	513340	My wife and I always love coming back to Santa Fe, and I can't tell you how honoured I am
514300	518300	to be giving the Ulam Lectures.
518300	523300	As you can see here, I've posted a little picture of Stan Ulam,
523300	526300	and he meant a lot to me.
526300	528300	I never had the pleasure of meeting him.
528300	534300	But when I was a teenager in high school, already in love with math and physics,
534300	540300	my beloved mentor, Mr De Curcio, gave me a book, A Graduation Present,
541300	544300	that he inscribed very affectionately.
544300	548300	And it was this book, Adventures of a Mathematician, SM Ulam,
548300	551300	who I had not heard of at that time.
551300	554300	But I learned a lot about him from the book.
554300	558300	It's a very candid and funny, quirky book.
558300	564300	You may be able to see, I don't know, the writing may be a little too small on that image on the side.
564300	570300	But it describes Ulam as, certainly true, a member of the famous Polish Mathematical School.
570300	575300	He'll be remembered probably forever as the person who invented the hydrogen bomb.
575300	581300	Edward Teller was working on it, but couldn't quite get it to work theoretically,
581300	586300	and Ulam figured out how to make it work for good or evil.
586300	588300	I don't know. This is how he'll be remembered, I suspect.
588300	592300	Which is a little bit of a pity, because in the world of math,
592300	597300	we think of him as one of the most creative mathematicians of the 20th century.
597300	602300	He thought of the method that we call the Monte Carlo method in constant use today
602300	607300	for solving all kinds of difficult probabilistic calculations.
607300	612300	He was extremely ingenious, and even in the subject that David mentioned,
612300	618300	my own subject, nonlinear dynamics, within Rico Fermi and other colleagues at Los Alamos,
618300	624300	he thought of ways to use what were then the very first computers to do scientific research,
624300	629300	not just to do calculations, but to perform computer experiments
629300	635300	and to learn things that you couldn't see either through pencil and paper or through observation.
635300	637300	You could see the invisible in the computer.
637300	642300	It was like a new kind of telescope or microscope for the mind. This was his idea.
642300	648300	Reading the book, one thing struck me that was a little puzzling,
648300	651300	which is he doesn't talk much about his wife.
651300	655300	She's in there, but she doesn't get mentioned so much,
655300	661300	and his wife Francoise, it turns out, actually is the writer of the book.
661300	668300	It's her modesty that we have to blame for her large absence in the book.
668300	673300	Francoise was a terrific writer. She had a degree in comparative literature,
673300	677300	and they had quite the love affair, I think, quite a great relationship,
677300	681300	giving birth to a daughter, Claire.
681300	689300	I had the pleasure to meet, well, there's Steve Weiner, who's here tonight.
689300	694300	That's Claire Weiner, and then their daughter, Rebecca Ulam Weiner.
694300	696300	I also had the pleasure to meet recently.
696300	702300	Anyway, so, yes, Francoise and Stan, quite the striking couple, weren't they?
702300	707300	I just want to leave you with one thought before I turn to my lecture proper here,
707300	709300	which is this remark of Stan's.
709300	714300	By the way, so the point was that he's dictating, he's telling stories to Francoise,
714300	720300	and she's writing them down and embellishing them and cleaning them up mostly.
720300	725300	Anyway, Stan says, it's still an unending source of surprise for me
725300	731300	to see how a few scribbles on a blackboard could change the course of human affairs,
731300	737300	to say the least, you know, if you think about what he did with the hydrogen bomb,
737300	744300	but also with his work really revolutionizing the way that we use computers in math and science.
744300	751300	So, with that, let me take up Ulam's theme of how a few scribbles can change the course of history,
751300	754300	because this is really what my story is about tonight.
754300	758300	The story of calculus is exactly that story.
758300	763300	Without calculus, we wouldn't have really anything that we are used to in the modern world.
763300	768300	We certainly wouldn't have radio, television, microwave ovens.
768300	773300	We wouldn't have been able to send astronauts to the moon or unravel the structure of DNA.
773300	776300	Looking at those pictures, can I ask you a little quiz?
776300	778300	Maybe for the younger people, I wonder.
778300	786300	If we've got some kids in the audience, does anyone know who's over there on the left?
786300	791300	You may have seen her in a movie recently or read about her.
791300	794300	Anyone want to shout it out?
794300	803300	That is Catherine Johnson, one of the hidden figures speaking of use of computers to solve important problems.
803300	808300	Actually, Catherine Johnson was a human calculator at the time when that referred to people.
808300	813300	The calculator was a person or even they were sometimes called computers.
813300	821300	Anyway, so then you see also Catherine in her 90s receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama.
821300	824300	Getting choked up thinking about her hidden figure status.
824300	830300	What about the other woman? Do you know who that is? Unraveling the structure of DNA?
830300	833300	Right, of course. That's Rosalind Franklin.
833300	841300	She is there next to her famous picture, an x-ray diffraction picture, revealing the helical structure of DNA.
841300	849300	Before Watson and Crick realized that, she in a way was channeling calculus.
849300	854300	To interpret an x-ray diffraction picture like that one you see next to her,
854300	858300	she had to use an outgrowth of calculus called Fourier analysis.
858300	866300	Just as Catherine Johnson was using differential equations to design trajectories to get our astronauts to the moon and back again safely.
866300	872300	So it's calculus throughout. It's in ultrasound for expectant mothers.
872300	879300	It's GPS for maybe getting you home tonight or lost travelers in general.
879300	887300	And as I already mentioned for nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, calculus throughout has helped make the world modern in so many ways.
887300	895300	So there's a mystery though in that, which is the calculus grew out of geometry.
895300	899300	And you might ask the question, and I want to explore this with you tonight.
899300	911300	How could it be that an arcane branch of math originally about shapes, specifically curved shapes, how could that have ultimately reshaped civilization?
912300	918300	And so I want to try to personify that question in the form of this gentleman, Herman Woke.
918300	926300	Some of you will know that Herman Woke was really a great American novelist of my parents' generation.
926300	929300	The World War II generation looked to Herman Woke.
929300	932300	He had served as a sailor in World War II.
932300	940300	He wanted to write the sort of big definitive novel about World War II
940300	947300	and ended up ballooning into two novels, The Winds of War and War and Remembrance, very famous books made into movies.
947300	953300	Cain Mutiny, you probably know that story, the book and movie, Humphrey Bogart in the movie anyway.
953300	959300	So Woke, when he was thinking about writing his big novel about World War II, someone told him,
959300	966300	you know, if you're going to write about the bomb, let's say, and the scientists who helped make the bomb,
966300	970300	you really ought to go talk to this gentleman, Richard Feynman.
970300	978300	Now, you'll recognize that there's a lot of Los Alamos and Santa Fe in these stories I'm telling here tonight.
978300	984300	Richard Feynman, of course, young, brilliant physicist, worked at Los Alamos on the bomb.
984300	992300	And so he was happy to receive Woke for their conversation about what was really happening, the inside story of the Manhattan Project.
992300	995300	Feynman, you'll see there in the pictures teaching at Caltech.
995300	1004300	He was a joker known for breaking into the safe at Los Alamos, going to strip clubs, playing his bongos character.
1004300	1007300	And anyway, so the two guys are talking.
1007300	1010300	Now, Woke and Feynman were both from New York City.
1010300	1012300	They found that they had that in common.
1012300	1015300	They were both Jewish guys, but there were also differences.
1015300	1020300	I mean, they had both served in the war, but Woke was very devout.
1020300	1024300	And Feynman was very much of an atheist.
1024300	1029300	And they found that they had a lot to talk about all around, and they had a good chat.
1029300	1032300	Anyway, they found themselves becoming friends.
1032300	1040300	And by the end of the chat, Feynman says to him in his, I guess, far rockaway accent that I won't attempt to imitate.
1040300	1043300	But something like, so you're really going to write this book.
1043300	1046300	Okay, I have one question for you.
1046300	1048300	Do you know calculus?
1048300	1053300	And Woke admits, well, no, I never studied calculus.
1053300	1056300	And then Feynman stares at him and says, well, you better learn it.
1056300	1059300	It's the language God talks.
1062300	1068300	And that became the title of a book that Woke wrote later, the language God talks.
1068300	1075300	You can maybe see the subtitle on science and religion about his conversations with prominent scientists,
1075300	1080300	John Weinberg, Feynman, a number of other, mostly atheists, about science and religion.
1080300	1083300	Are those irreconcilable? Are they compatible?
1083300	1089300	So I commend that book to your attention if you're interested in the relationship between science and religion.
1089300	1096300	But in particular, on the point of calculus, is it necessary to learn calculus as Feynman admonished him?
1096300	1098300	He needed to learn calculus.
1098300	1103300	Woke took him seriously, and he tells the story of what happened.
1103300	1108300	He says, I picked up and skimmed some freshman texts in college bookstores,
1108300	1113300	hoping to come across one that might help a mathematical ignoramus like me,
1113300	1119300	who had spent his college years in the humanities, i.e. literature and philosophy,
1119300	1125300	in an adolescent quest for the meaning of existence, like many college students.
1125300	1130300	A little knowing that calculus, which I had heard of as a difficult bore leading nowhere,
1130300	1133300	was the language God talks.
1133300	1143300	So he's motivated to learn calculus, but then it turns out that it's hard for someone in his position to learn calculus.
1143300	1151300	It's really hard, and he tells stories about it that he couldn't get anything from these freshman textbooks.
1151300	1154300	It was gibberish to him, so that didn't seem to work.
1154300	1159300	He hired a tutor, who happened to be an Israeli guy,
1159300	1162300	because he thought he was a person who knew a lot about math,
1162300	1166300	but he thought maybe I could also pick up and improve my spoken Hebrew on the side,
1166300	1169300	which he was interested in, so anyway he's with this Israeli tutor.
1169300	1171300	That didn't really work out so well.
1171300	1179300	Then, in fact, on both counts, and then he attended a high school class
1179300	1184300	and was very serious about going and doing all the homework for several weeks,
1184300	1189300	but he gradually fell behind and decided at some point to quit.
1189300	1194300	As he was leaving, he says that the students, all these teenagers, started clapping,
1194300	1199300	which he interpreted as sympathy applause, like for a pitiful showbiz act.
1199300	1208300	So my point is that it is not easy for many people to absorb the language God talks,
1208300	1209300	to learn calculus.
1209300	1213300	This made me personally sad thinking about this,
1213300	1217300	because I love calculus and want the world to appreciate it.
1217300	1221300	So I wrote this book recently, Infinite Powers,
1221300	1225300	subtitle How Calculus Reveals the Secret of the Universe.
1225300	1227300	Secrets, yeah.
1227300	1229300	Well, okay, you've got to sell books.
1229300	1234300	With people like Herman Woke in mind,
1234300	1240300	the reason I'm telling you the whole story is I want this talk to be accessible to anybody of goodwill,
1240300	1244300	like Herman Woke, an educated, curious person who didn't know much math,
1244300	1248300	but seriously wanted to get what is so special about calculus.
1248300	1251300	So I think of him as my ideal reader.
1251300	1256300	Actually, I sent him a copy of the book through his agent,
1256300	1261300	but he was about 103 years old at that point.
1261300	1265300	And I was told that his wife had recently passed away,
1265300	1267300	a good long life for both of them.
1267300	1271300	But I don't know if he ever really received the book or read it,
1271300	1275300	so I don't have a good conclusion for you about that.
1275300	1278300	But I do sort of have Herman Woke in mind,
1278300	1282300	and this book is for you, Mr Woke, if you can hear me.
1282300	1286300	So let me try to address the question,
1286300	1292300	what did Feynman mean with that cryptic comment that calculus is the language God talks?
1292300	1295300	What could that possibly mean?
1295300	1299300	All right, so let's talk a little bit about one case study.
1299300	1303300	I want to tell you the story of electricity and magnetism
1303300	1307300	and what calculus taught us about those phenomena.
1307300	1311300	So electricity, all right, there's a little picture of my daughter,
1311300	1315300	Leah, when she was much younger playing around in her grandmother's apartment,
1315300	1318300	and it was a wintry day. It was dry in the apartment.
1318300	1321300	Her hair got all staticky.
1321300	1325300	Lots of electrons rubbed off onto her hair without her knowing it.
1325300	1328300	They repelled each other. They made her hair look like that.
1328300	1331300	You're probably familiar with the phenomenon.
1331300	1335300	So yeah, that's static electricity.
1335300	1339300	There's also the electricity that's powering my microphone right now.
1339300	1341300	There's also magnetism.
1341300	1344300	You may have played around with bar magnets as a kid,
1344300	1347300	maybe even done a little experiment like this,
1347300	1351300	where you sprinkle iron filings on a piece of paper around a bar magnet,
1351300	1355300	and then amazingly, these iron filings reveal some kind of pattern.
1355300	1361300	They don't just form a random, you know, haphazard scatter on the page.
1361300	1366300	If you jiggle the page lightly, they start to align in this amazing, organized way,
1366300	1370300	suggesting that there's something around the magnet that is otherwise invisible
1370300	1373300	but that is now made manifest by these iron filings.
1373300	1378300	Michael Faraday did experiments like this back in the 1820s and 30s
1378300	1381300	and came up with the idea that there is something, although invisible,
1381300	1384300	something very real around a magnet,
1384300	1388300	which he called lines of force visualized by these filings,
1388300	1390300	but we today call it the magnetic field.
1390300	1394300	Similarly, there are invisible aspects of electricity
1394300	1396300	that we would call the electric field.
1396300	1401300	In the 1800s, scientists like Michael Faraday and Ampyr,
1401300	1407300	whose name lives on in the unit of electrical current, and Gauss and Ersted and many others,
1407300	1411300	were starting to try to figure out how do electricity and magnetism work.
1411300	1417300	Faraday created the first electric motor and electromagnets and lots of other things.
1417300	1419300	They started to realize there was this intimate relationship
1419300	1424300	like you could put a current through a wire and then the wire would start to act magnetic.
1424300	1428300	There would be a magnetic field around that wire with the current going through it and so on.
1428300	1432300	Anyway, Faraday didn't have much math background,
1432300	1436300	but this gentleman did, James Clerk Maxwell.
1436300	1438300	There's a picture of him as a young man.
1438300	1442300	He was a Scottish physicist and a mathematical physicist.
1442300	1446300	Usually you see him in pictures when he's much later in life with a big beard,
1446300	1449300	but I like this picture of him as a young man.
1449300	1453300	Anyway, he realized that what Faraday and others had been discovering
1453300	1457300	could be written in the language of calculus,
1457300	1460300	that there were certain laws about electricity and magnetism,
1460300	1466300	specifically how changing an electric field could produce magnetic effects
1466300	1470300	and changing electric fields, or did I say that first?
1470300	1472300	Basically changing one can produce the other.
1472300	1476300	Changing magnetism can generate electricity and vice versa.
1476300	1479300	He wrote what we would call differential equations,
1479300	1484300	meaning equations that describe how things change from moment to moment or place to place,
1484300	1488300	little differences in time or space, hence differential.
1488300	1498300	He wrote differential equations that encoded what Faraday and Ersted and Gauss and Ampere had discovered.
1498300	1503300	So now these physical discoveries from science, from tinkering,
1503300	1508300	were put in the language of math, and then comes the spooky part.
1508300	1512300	I mean it may not surprise you that math can describe physical phenomena.
1512300	1516300	We know that math is a language, but math is much more than a language,
1516300	1521300	and this is the part that I find uncanny, and that I think has something to do with what Feynman was talking about,
1521300	1525300	that with math you can actually manipulate equations.
1525300	1531300	You know that you can add and subtract if you're doing stuff with numbers,
1531300	1536300	but in algebra you do things like substitute a variable into another equation,
1536300	1541300	or you can divide, or in calculus you can do similar things, but they're more sophisticated,
1541300	1546300	and these manipulations, I want you to think of the word manipulate like in the spas here in town,
1546300	1549300	where you have a masseuse who's actually manipulating you,
1549300	1552300	and maybe you start mumbling and telling some intimate secrets.
1552300	1555300	You can get equations to do that.
1555300	1560300	If you can massage them the right way and get them to relax and open up,
1560300	1563300	they will tell you amazing things.
1563300	1566300	Okay, I'm being a little bit silly and metaphorical,
1566300	1572300	but what's really going on is that these operations of math are really long logical arguments
1572300	1574300	that are too long to keep in your head,
1574300	1579300	but you're applying logic to the equations and transforming them by manipulating them,
1579300	1584300	and they start to look different, and so Maxwell did this to these four equations that were known,
1584300	1588300	and he started to see something, he didn't know what he was looking for really,
1588300	1590300	but at some point he saw something he recognized,
1590300	1596300	which was an equation that describes the spreading of a ripple on a pond.
1596300	1604300	It describes a wave moving, and what is this wave that he's discovering?
1604300	1607300	He's curious how fast does it move.
1607300	1609300	If it's a wave, it's traveling, it has a speed.
1609300	1612300	He calculates the speed of this wave, and this part I'm just making up,
1612300	1617300	but I like to imagine him somewhere in Scotland and he's got his candle burning,
1617300	1623300	and he's calculating, and out comes the speed of these electromagnetic waves,
1623300	1628300	and they're moving at the speed of light, which is a pretty interesting coincidence.
1628300	1634300	In that moment, unique in human history, Maxwell is the first person to understand what light is.
1634300	1641300	People have thought about light for millennia, but Maxwell understands that light is a propagating wave of electricity and magnetism,
1641300	1647300	dancing together in his Pada da, and each regenerating the other.
1647300	1654300	He has this prediction from calculus and these known physical laws that light can move as an electromagnetic wave,
1654300	1656300	and it doesn't have to just be light.
1656300	1660300	There can be other kinds of non-visible forms of electromagnetic waves.
1660300	1667300	This comes out of his calculations around 1860, so think of the time of the Civil War in the US.
1667300	1675300	Soon after, Heinrich Hertz observes these predictions that come out of, like Ulam said, scribbling on a blackboard.
1675300	1679300	Nature is doing something that's respecting the scribbling,
1679300	1685300	and then Tesla figures out a way to use it to transmit energy wirelessly.
1685300	1691300	This should sound familiar, and then Marconi is sending messages across the Atlantic Ocean with it,
1692300	1695300	and then you have the 20th century.
1695300	1701300	You have radio and television and telephone and things we take for granted now, but it did come from calculus.
1701300	1707300	Now, I don't want to say calculus alone did this because I hope I told the story in a way that you're getting it,
1707300	1712300	that it was essential to have the physicists making their discoveries about electricity and magnetism,
1712300	1717300	but math was a key supporting player in this drama, specifically calculus.
1717300	1720300	I think that you can buy t-shirts now that look like this.
1720300	1727300	Some of you may even own this t-shirt, and God said, and there's Maxwell's equations in vector calculus,
1727300	1729300	and there was light.
1729300	1732300	It's actually kind of true.
1732300	1741300	So I sort of think this is what Feynman meant, that the language of electricity and magnetism that God talks is calculus.
1741300	1745300	This is a specific dialect of calculus, we call vector calculus,
1745300	1748300	but it doesn't just apply to electricity and magnetism.
1748300	1755300	The same is true if we were talking about how air moves, or water, or how heat diffuses,
1755300	1759300	or how gravity works, or even in the quantum mechanical realm.
1759300	1765300	All of those phenomena are described by this same sub-dialect of math, differential equations,
1765300	1768300	a specific kind of use of calculus.
1768300	1774300	So my argument for the rest of the talk is going to be that calculus matters because of these three things.
1774300	1780300	First, that nature's laws happen to be written in this particular language, calculus,
1780300	1784300	but that calculus is more than a language, it's a system of reasoning.
1784300	1792300	Like when Maxwell's doing his mathematical manipulations, he's somehow tapping into the inner logic of the universe.
1792300	1795300	It's not just playing games with symbols.
1795300	1803300	Nature is somehow doing the same thing that, I mean I find this really bizarre, so do many other people,
1803300	1812300	that we, with our puny primate logic, happen to have stumbled across something that mirrors the way nature really works,
1812300	1819300	that you can predict stuff that is out there, and then by learning to speak this strange language,
1819300	1826300	and by discovering that it taps into nature's hidden logic, we can use calculus to remake the world.
1826300	1832300	So that's the gist of the argument here, this is why calculus matters, at least from one point of view.
1832300	1839300	Now, in telling the story of calculus, I want to, at this moment, personify calculus.
1839300	1843300	I want you to think of it as something that has desires.
1843300	1848300	Now, if that's too ridiculous, think of it as the practitioners of calculus have desires.
1848300	1853300	But I'm going to say it this way, what does calculus want, and how does it get what it wants?
1853300	1858300	So the answer to what it wants, before I tell you what calculus really is,
1859300	1863300	what calculus wants to do is make hard problems simpler.
1863300	1868300	And this came as a surprise to my editor, who did not know any math when I was writing this book,
1868300	1873300	but he eventually said to me, I now get it after reading three drafts of the book, I get,
1873300	1877300	no, I mean he kept telling me do this, do that, I kept changing it, but by the third one he said,
1877300	1879300	I'm really starting to get what this is.
1879300	1885300	The books are so fat, the calculus textbooks are so big, because the problems are so hard,
1885300	1891300	but somehow you have found a way, not you, me, but I mean the people that do calculus
1891300	1895300	have found a way to make very hard problems tractable.
1895300	1897300	Now, how do they do it?
1897300	1900300	Okay, so how does calculus get what it wants?
1900300	1906300	Here's the strategy, it's going to slice hard problems into smaller pieces.
1906300	1908300	Okay, that might sound familiar.
1908300	1911300	You know that every good problem solver says if a problem is too hard,
1911300	1915300	break it down and solve simpler, easier problems first.
1915300	1917300	Fine, that's a time-honored strategy.
1917300	1925300	But calculus is a maniacal strategy that keeps doing this forever, indefinitely odd infinitum.
1925300	1929300	So calculus takes this idea of chopping to the infinite limit.
1929300	1938300	It keeps cutting and cutting and cutting and never stops until what's left is an infinite number of infinitesimal pieces.
1938300	1943300	This is the big idea at the heart of calculus, I'm going to call it the infinity principle,
1943300	1951300	which is that if you cut a problem of a certain class of math or physics problems,
1951300	1955300	and actually many problems nowadays, even in biology or the social sciences,
1955300	1961300	if you can subdivide it into infinitely many infinitesimal pieces, you have a strategy,
1961300	1966300	which is you're going to solve the problem first for the tiny pieces, and that tends to be easy.
1966300	1969300	Much easier than the problem originally was.
1969300	1971300	So that's why there's hope that this is going to work.
1971300	1975300	The heart problem is putting the pieces back together. There's no free lunch.
1975300	1977300	So that is the challenge in calculus.
1977300	1982300	Now that you've solved the little problems, how does that tell you about the original big problem?
1982300	1987300	Well, all right, so we have names for those two parts, the easy and the hard part.
1987300	1991300	The slicing part is what we call differential calculus, and that's actually easy.
1991300	1994300	We usually teach that at the beginning of the semester.
1995300	1999300	The hard part is the putting them back together, integrating everything into a whole,
1999300	2004300	and that's integral calculus, the rebuilding part.
2004300	2006300	All right, so that's our strategy.
2006300	2013300	And so from that point of view, calculus is about this exploitation of the infinity principle.
2013300	2017300	Now, you'll notice in the way I described what the principle is,
2017300	2019300	that you're going to keep cutting and cutting indefinitely,
2019300	2026300	you have to recognize that that's a wild fantasy that you could ever do that in real life.
2026300	2033300	And it has to do with a fantasy that stuff of all kinds is what I'm going to call continuous.
2033300	2038300	All right, so the infinity principle works nicely for things that are continuous,
2038300	2042300	to anything that can be sliced finer and finer forever, endlessly.
2042300	2045300	Those are what I'm going to call continuous, things that hold together,
2045300	2049300	I mean, from two Latin words that mean holding together.
2049300	2051300	No smallest parts.
2051300	2055300	And I want to make sure you understand, since this is a talk about stories,
2055300	2060300	that in math we tell ourselves stories just like everybody tells themselves stories.
2060300	2064300	There is an enormous creative fantasy happening right now.
2064300	2069300	The idea that matter is continuous, we know to be false, right?
2069300	2071300	We believe in atoms.
2071300	2073300	The word atom means uncuttable.
2073300	2075300	There are smallest bits.
2075300	2078300	You might not believe that atoms are the smallest bits,
2078300	2082300	but we don't really talk about splitting an electron.
2082300	2086300	We think at some level, matter can't be split farther.
2086300	2089300	At least that's what the modern physicists tell us.
2089300	2094300	And not just substance, but even time and space themselves.
2094300	2097300	If you listen to people talk about quantum gravity,
2097300	2100300	a theory that doesn't quite exist yet,
2100300	2103300	but we're working hard on it.
2103300	2109300	Once quantum mechanics and gravity are unified properly,
2109300	2114300	there's a belief that there will be a smallest unit of time and space,
2114300	2118300	which was already anticipated 100 years ago by Max Planck.
2118300	2122300	There's something called that if you combine fundamental constants
2122300	2125300	that control the strength of quantum effects,
2125300	2127300	something called H Planck's constant,
2127300	2131300	something that controls the structure of spacetime, the speed of light, C,
2131300	2135300	and something that controls the strength of gravity, Newton's constant, G.
2135300	2138300	There's only one way to combine those three quantities
2138300	2141300	to make something with the units of length.
2141300	2144300	Planck realized that, and if you do that, you get the Planck length,
2144300	2148300	which is 10 to the minus 35 meters approximately,
2148300	2151300	which is way smaller than an atomic nucleus.
2151300	2153300	It's way smaller than anything we could measure.
2153300	2155300	Way smaller.
2155300	2160300	But there is a feeling that no matter what quantum gravity ends up being,
2160300	2164300	as a theory, it will have the Planck length in it on dimensional grounds,
2164300	2167300	and something funky has to happen to space at that scale.
2167300	2172300	Either it gets pixelated, it's thrashing wildly from quantum jitters.
2172300	2174300	We don't know what's going to happen down there,
2174300	2178300	but it's going to not look smooth and continuous.
2178300	2180300	It's going to be weird.
2180300	2184300	And the same thing for the time it will take for light to travel that distance,
2184300	2187300	that will be 10 to the minus 43 seconds.
2187300	2190300	Time is going to get granular or weird.
2190300	2193300	The point being, nobody in modern physics would tell you
2193300	2197300	that nature is ultimately smooth and continuous today.
2197300	2199300	They may be wrong. I mean, maybe it is.
2199300	2203300	But our best understanding is that calculus is based on a lie.
2205300	2209300	The idea that you could keep cutting forever is not true in real life.
2209300	2214300	Nevertheless, creativity often involves wishful thinking.
2214300	2218300	We can imagine that we could cut forever, and doing it gives us calculus.
2218300	2222300	Really, like I say, the most powerful math we've ever thought of as a species.
2222300	2226300	So appreciating that there is this creative fantasy,
2226300	2230300	I would say calculus is not the study of derivatives and integrals
2230300	2232300	like your teacher might have told you.
2232300	2236300	It's the study of using the infinity principle systematically
2236300	2239300	to shed light on any continuous thing.
2239300	2245300	Any continuous shape, object, motion, phenomenon, process,
2245300	2248300	anything at all that can be thought of as continuous.
2248300	2251300	All right, so let me give you some examples of what calculus looks like.
2251300	2255300	Think of it as having to do, if you had to define it after you leave the lecture
2255300	2258300	and someone says you went to calculus lecture, what is calculus?
2258300	2261300	You could say it's the study of continuous change.
2261300	2264300	That works pretty well, or smooth change.
2264300	2266300	Or if you don't want adjectives, change.
2266300	2268300	Calculus is about change.
2268300	2272300	If you want to get a little more descriptive, it's about things that change direction,
2272300	2274300	which I would call curves.
2274300	2278300	Or it's about things that change location, which I would call motion.
2278300	2283300	Or it's about things that change in some other way, which I would call change.
2283300	2286300	So curves, motion, and change.
2286300	2288300	Those are the three obsessions of calculus.
2288300	2291300	Historically, calculus began with curves.
2292300	2294300	That's why I say it grew out of geometry.
2294300	2300300	In the olden days, like Euclid, math of geometry was about straight lines and sharp angles.
2300300	2304300	The triangles and squares you learned about in elementary geometry.
2304300	2306300	But you also learned this.
2306300	2308300	Okay, now that's a curve.
2308300	2309300	That's a circle.
2309300	2311300	Curvy is a thing can be.
2311300	2317300	You probably memorized a formula at some point in your life that the area of a circle is...
2317300	2319300	Did anyone know what to say?
2319300	2321300	Yeah, right? Pi r squared.
2321300	2324300	Everybody memorizes that for the SATs.
2324300	2329300	That's a formula involving that amazing number pi,
2329300	2336300	which already gives you a hint that that formula, because pi has those infinitely many digits that never repeat,
2336300	2339300	there's already a hint of calculus in there with the infinity principle.
2339300	2342300	Pi is not a creature of geometry.
2342300	2345300	Pi is actually a creature of calculus.
2346300	2351300	They snuck calculus into that formula when they told you pi r squared.
2351300	2353300	Where does that formula come from?
2353300	2357300	I want to show you an argument that is very close to the argument that Archimedes used
2357300	2362300	when he discovered and first proved the formula around 250 BC.
2362300	2366300	I'm reminding you the circumference of a circle, that's the distance around.
2366300	2370300	The diameter is the distance across through the middle at the widest point.
2370300	2376300	The radius, the r in pi r squared, that would be the distance from the center out to the circle.
2376300	2381300	The area refers to that green stuff inside, not the distance around, not the circumference.
2381300	2383300	We want the area inside a circle.
2383300	2388300	Here's an argument that will give us the pi r squared using the infinity principle.
2388300	2394300	Watch this. If you've never seen it, I think you're about to have a big epiphany.
2394300	2397300	If you have seen it, pretend that you're excited.
2398300	2404300	What we're going to do is this dramatic argument where we take the circle and chop it into four pieces.
2404300	2411300	The strategy is, if I could figure out the area of those four pieces, I would know the area of the whole circle.
2411300	2415300	I'm now going to try to rearrange the pieces into some shape that I recognize,
2415300	2418300	whose area I will know and that will be the area of the circle.
2418300	2423300	My first attempt is to make that shape on the bottom that looks like some kind of, I don't know what,
2423300	2429300	a worm or some scalloped shape. It doesn't look promising, but there it is.
2429300	2435300	If you want to think of it with pizza slices, I put one point down and then one point up, and I've snuggled them together.
2435300	2440300	The thing I want you to look at is that this distance here is what I'm calling r, the radius of the circle,
2440300	2445300	because it's the distance from what used to be the center. All these points are at the center.
2445300	2452300	I go from the center out to the curve. That's r, and then this distance along the bottom is half the circumference.
2452300	2460300	Half the curvy stuff. The circumference is pi times the diameter. We could also say 2 pi times the radius.
2460300	2466300	Half of that is just pi times the radius, and that's the distance around these curved scallops on the bottom.
2466300	2470300	The other pi r is up here on the top, making the whole circumference.
2470300	2478300	This is not so helpful at the moment, but now we're going to do like the optometrist does when trying to figure out your prescription.
2478300	2487300	Is this better or worse? Which is better? So what am I doing? I'm going to make eight slices,
2487300	2492300	and I want you to keep your eye on what happened here, which is that this is still the radius,
2492300	2498300	and this is still the curvy bottom of total length pi r. Do you see what's happening?
2498300	2503300	That the shape is starting to look more promising, more recognizable. What if I do it again?
2503300	2514300	Better? Even better. That's now 16 slices, and look, this is practically a parallelogram.
2514300	2521300	It's practically flat. It's not really, it's got little curves, but you can see it's getting flatter and flatter.
2521300	2527300	Compare what it was like that. This is very bulbous. This is getting flatter, and that's flatter still.
2527300	2537300	Also, let us compare the radius. Look how nearly upright that radius is standing, compared to how tilted that one is, compared to how tilted that one is.
2537300	2543300	Do you see what's going on? The more you take, the flatter and the more upright it gets.
2543300	2551300	So what do you think happens if I take infinitely many slices, infinitesimally thin? You get that.
2552300	2562300	Now that, you know how to find the area of, because that's a rectangle, and now we're back in classical geometry, so it's just the length times the height, pi r times r, that's pi r squared.
2562300	2568300	That's actually the reason. So if you have memorized it and never knew why, you now know why.
2568300	2576300	But you had to use calculus. You had to use this idea of taking infinitely many infinitesimal slices to get it, and it's because curves are hard.
2576300	2581300	We had to get rid of the curves and replace them with straight lines, so that we could use ordinary geometry.
2581300	2589300	And that's the genius of the early creators of calculus, Archimedes and Eudoxus and people like that in ancient Greece.
2589300	2592300	They were using the infinity principle to do problems like this.
2592300	2601300	Okay, so now Archimedes, although to us just sounds like another old Greek name, really lives on all around us today.
2601300	2612300	For instance, look at this. If you wanted to represent this head of a mannequin in computer graphics with a smooth bald head and smooth cheeks, you can do what Archimedes did.
2612300	2625300	You take something that's simple shapes analogous to the pizza slices, you could use triangles, and the more you take of them, the finer the mesh, the closer you get to something that looks like a smooth face.
2625300	2638300	And this is commonplace nowadays in computer graphics, like say in this movie Jerry's Game, which was really the first movie with a human character that had lots of expressions and emotions.
2638300	2651300	You can find it at its old five minute movie on YouTube, but it won the best short animated film back in 1998, and Jerry playing chess there in the park is built of millions of polygons.
2651300	2657300	You don't see them, just like you don't notice all the polygons in that smooth mannequin.
2657300	2671300	But going on even better to Shrek with his little trumpety ears or his belly explaining onions have layers to donkey, these creatures don't exist except as meshes of polygons.
2671300	2681300	So it's enormously powerful, this idea of replacing curved shapes with straight shapes by making them infinitesimally small and very plentiful.
2681300	2692300	And so if you just think it's about computer graphics, I want to show you a more serious application of this idea, which is, here's a patient, you may be able to see that his jaw is sticking out.
2692300	2717300	It's a congenital malformation here, and he went in for cranio facial surgery. The treatment is doctors, the surgeons, are going to take out some of the bones in his jaw and let his whole face heal, and they hope that he will look and feel the way that he wants to look and feel after the surgery.
2717300	2724300	But you don't really get a second chance. You want to predict what's going to happen after the face and the whole head heals.
2724300	2732300	So they first put this guy in a scanner, CT scanner, they get all the details of his bones and everything.
2732300	2743300	And then they have a mathematical model of what will happen with the soft tissues if they replace some bone and they're also taking out cartilage and maybe some, hopefully not too many blood vessels, but whatever.
2743300	2753300	It's complicated surgery, and this mathematical model built on differential equations and calculus tells them where to, it's basically like a flight simulator for surgeons.
2753300	2765300	So they can do the surgery on a virtual patient ahead of time. And so the model predicted that if they do what they should do, his new face will look like this, and here's his actual new face.
2766300	2771300	And they could quantify how close they were to the model. It was only ever off by like a millimeter at the most.
2771300	2781300	But what I want to show you is that the model consists of this Archimedean principle of lots of little triangles and polygons, except now in three dimensions.
2781300	2793300	So they have to put in tetrahedra in here underneath the skin, thinking about the whole model of the head, all these various soft tissues with their different elastic properties and stiffnesses and everything.
2793300	2801300	It's all elasticity theory and continuum mechanics built on calculus that makes this surgery possible and so effective.
2801300	2815300	Okay, so saying that calculus is about curves, motion and change, I've talked to you a little about, in case of this guy, the changing appearance and structure of his head.
2816300	2822300	We've talked about the change in Maxwell's equations and predictions of electromagnetic waves and wireless and all that.
2822300	2828300	But in general, curves are very big in data science. You know, that's something we teach our students.
2828300	2832300	How to represent changing relationships of all kinds in algebra class.
2832300	2836300	We teach them the X, Y plane and Cartesian coordinates.
2836300	2841300	The point being that curves are not just curves. Curves are the key to thinking about data.
2842300	2846300	And we can represent motion and change with curves, visually.
2846300	2857300	So I want to finish with this thought, which has to do with, speaking of motion, let us talk about Usain Bolt.
2857300	2862300	So Usain Bolt, you may remember, was a wonderful sprinter from Jamaica.
2862300	2866300	It didn't look like a typical sprinter. He's about six-five.
2866300	2869300	Usually a sprinter is a pretty compact muscular person.
2869300	2876300	Usain is a very gangly, tall guy, muscular, but very long legs.
2876300	2883300	And he normally was known for running the 200 meters. He was essentially invincible at that distance.
2883300	2889300	But he wanted to also try his hand. I feel like that's the wrong body part.
2889300	2896300	He wanted to try running the 100 meter dash at the Olympics back in Beijing in 2008.
2897300	2901300	And his coach said, it's not a great idea. You're a 200 meter man. Let's just stick with that.
2901300	2903300	He said, I want to practice. Let's try the 100.
2903300	2912300	So he ran the 100 meters in competition five times, which is not a lot to be going against the world's best 100 meter runners.
2912300	2917300	But anyway, he shows up in Beijing and I want to show you what happened on that night.
2917300	2922300	It's about 10.30 at night. No wind. Very good night to run.
2922300	2927300	So here's the, as it was called at the time.
2927300	2934300	And so back to 2008 and the Olympic Games in Beijing, the final of the men's 100 meters.
2934300	2937300	Usain was ready to do his thing.
2937300	2942300	And now a great start by Richard Thompson in lane four from Trinidad.
2942300	2946300	And here comes Usain Bolt. Bolt is pulling away. Bolt's looking back.
2946300	2952300	You don't look back in 100 meters. 9.68 is a world record for Usain Bolt.
2952300	2958300	9.68, a new world record, the fastest man in the world.
2958300	2964300	That celebration on the line told the world he could run faster and soon he would.
2964300	2968300	But it was the Olympic gold medal he really wanted.
2970300	2972300	If that went by too fast, do you want to watch that again?
2972300	2977300	That went by pretty fast, okay? 10 seconds. No, well, 9.68 seconds. Watch this again.
2977300	2981300	So keep your eye on Usain Bolt. He doesn't get the best start.
2981300	2985300	He was never the best. In fact, he was number seven out of eight coming out of the starting blocks.
2988300	2995300	And so back to 2008 and the Olympic Games in Beijing, the final of the men's 100 meters.
2995300	2998300	Usain was ready to do his thing.
2998300	3003300	And off. Great start by Richard Thompson in lane four from Trinidad.
3003300	3007300	And here comes Usain Bolt. Bolt is pulling away. Bolt's looking back.
3007300	3013300	You don't look back in 100 meters. 9.68 is a world record for Usain Bolt.
3013300	3019300	9.68, a new world record, the fastest man in the world.
3019300	3025300	That celebration on the line told the world he could run faster and soon he would.
3025300	3027300	But it was the Olympic.
3027300	3029300	Here, look at this.
3031300	3034300	Okay, those guys are running like hell.
3034300	3038300	And Usain Bolt has put his arms down.
3038300	3042300	You probably can't see it, but his shoelace is untied.
3042300	3046300	He's a very mischievous guy. He was known as a practical joker.
3046300	3050300	And he's coasting across the finish line and breaking the world record.
3050300	3055300	He stopped the running with the proper form about 10 or 20 meters before the end.
3055300	3058300	And he's just goofing around, slapping his chest.
3058300	3062300	He's so excited. I mean, I don't think it was, some people thought it was a little obnoxious.
3062300	3065300	But I think he was just celebrating. He's a very good natured guy.
3065300	3067300	Didn't mean any disrespect.
3067300	3073300	But anyway, the question became in the sports world, what if he had run hard all the way?
3073300	3076300	I mean, he already broke the world record with 9.68.
3076300	3079300	How fast could he have run so we could analyze this with math?
3080300	3086300	They have little recording devices every 10 meters down the track that measures his split time.
3086300	3089300	What time did he cross this 10 meters and the next 10 meters?
3089300	3092300	And from those data, we get this graph.
3092300	3096300	So here's his distance down the track as a function of time.
3096300	3101300	And you can see at the beginning, well, all right, let me be honest about this.
3101300	3105300	I actually only have these dots. That's what we know.
3106300	3109300	We also have the tape, but it's hard to tell from the tape.
3109300	3111300	There's a lot of distortion in the footage.
3111300	3114300	It's not so easy to really know exactly what's happening.
3114300	3120300	But you can fit a smooth curve through the dots by various statistical techniques,
3120300	3124300	which, by the way, use calculus, something called linear regression.
3124300	3129300	So you can estimate, excuse me, in a good way, a reasonable smooth curve through there
3129300	3133300	with the further constraint that its slope at the beginning should be zero,
3133300	3135300	because we know he had zero speed coming out of the blocks.
3135300	3137300	He's motionless at first.
3137300	3142300	So if you fit a curve with those constraints, you can then look at the slope at every point on that curve,
3142300	3146300	and that will tell you his speed instant by instant, and it looks like this.
3148300	3150300	You see the message there?
3150300	3152300	It's what you saw visually. It's very obvious.
3152300	3154300	He's picking up speed.
3155300	3158300	His peak speed was around 27 miles an hour.
3158300	3160300	This is when he's pulling away.
3160300	3165300	Then he's still accelerating, and then he starts slapping his chest and fooling around,
3165300	3167300	and he's slowing down.
3167300	3169300	So what would happen if he kept going?
3169300	3170300	All right.
3170300	3173300	So we could do that extrapolation, but actually we don't have to,
3173300	3178300	because a few months later was the world championship in Berlin.
3178300	3181300	And this time, the scientists were ready.
3181300	3185300	So they put little reflecting dots on the back of everything,
3185300	3189300	so they put little reflecting dots on the back of every runner,
3189300	3195300	and were shining sort of like the radar guns that the police would use to see if you're speeding.
3195300	3197300	I think they might actually have been laser guns,
3197300	3205300	but in any case, they could record 100 times per second where the runner was for each of the runners.
3205300	3208300	And so that's a very precise measurement, and here's what the data...
3208300	3210300	Oh, he broke the world record again.
3210300	3213300	I think it was now 9.58.
3213300	3215300	And so here's the data.
3215300	3220300	Now, what do you think all those wiggles are?
3220300	3222300	This is the wiggles of the actual data.
3222300	3224300	Do you know what those are?
3224300	3226300	Those are actually steps.
3226300	3227300	Breathing is an interesting guess.
3227300	3229300	Yeah, those are steps.
3229300	3234300	When you run, you're leaping and landing, and doing that again.
3234300	3238300	And in Usain Bolt's case, he does it 41 times.
3238300	3241300	Everybody else does 45 steps.
3241300	3242300	I told you he has long legs.
3242300	3247300	So he runs 41 steps in the 100 meters, and there's 41 wiggles in here.
3247300	3251300	And what I find interesting about this, and I want to leave you with this thought,
3251300	3254300	is that we don't really care about that.
3254300	3256300	That's not interesting, the wiggle.
3256300	3262300	I mean, yes, it's slightly interesting that his speed varies during a single foot cycle.
3262300	3268300	But what we're really interested in is the trend, the average that's going through here, these dots.
3268300	3271300	And so I want that to be kind of a little parable for you,
3271300	3275300	that sometimes if you get too detailed in your science,
3275300	3279300	you might start measuring stuff you're not actually interested in.
3279300	3282300	And I think that calculus is like that.
3282300	3286300	That when we take this approximation that we can cut things infinitely finally,
3286300	3288300	it's not really true.
3288300	3292300	At the finest scale, there's quantum jitters and other things that we don't care about.
3292300	3297300	Calculus is capturing the trend of reality over a tremendous number of orders of magnitude
3297300	3301300	of space and time and substance and everything.
3301300	3306300	And it's based on a lie, but it's capturing something true.
3306300	3312300	And so I think it's very well said by Picasso, art is a lie that makes us realize truth.
3312300	3316300	So I really do think that's the lesson, that is the story of calculus.
3316300	3318300	Thank you.
3328300	3330300	Thanks.
3334300	3337300	I see some microphones going around.
3337300	3339300	Are we doing questions here?
3339300	3342300	Oh, I would love to take questions if people would like.
3342300	3344300	So there are some microphones available.
3344300	3348300	If you just stand up or wave your hand, they'll come find you.
3348300	3350300	Yes, okay.
3350300	3353300	There are two of us, so try to get either of our attention.
3358300	3363300	Did you figure out how fast the world record would have been in those 2008 Olympics?
3363300	3366300	Well, it's a very good question. I did set that up.
3366300	3370300	Right, so we should probably really do the calculation I suggested.
3370300	3374300	Imagine if I extrapolated without the slowing down, what would he have run on that night?
3374300	3377300	I honestly haven't done it. It's a good question.
3377300	3380300	Could he have done even better than the 9.58?
3380300	3384300	I don't know. I haven't done the calculation. I should. It's a good question.
3384300	3386300	I have the data.
3386300	3391300	So we could just ignore the last few data points and then draw a straight line.
3391300	3393300	It's a good question. I'm sorry, I don't know.
3393300	3396300	Yes, there's a question over on the far left.
3402300	3407300	Can calculus be used in the research of cancer?
3407300	3411300	Calculus is being used constantly in cancer research.
3411300	3417300	Sure, yeah, I mean, we have mathematical models of various types,
3417300	3421300	so you can talk about the, for instance, the growth of a tumor has been modeled
3421300	3424300	with so-called partial differential equations.
3424300	3429300	There are questions about optimal dosing of chemotherapy,
3429300	3433300	or suppose you have several chemotherapy drugs that might work,
3433300	3437300	but if you just use one for too long, the patient develops resistance to it.
3437300	3441300	So is there an optimal way to trade off between a few different drugs?
3441300	3446300	I have a colleague, Dr. Jake Scott at Cleveland Clinic, who's doing exactly that,
3446300	3449300	using a branch of math called Optimal Control Theory,
3449300	3454300	which builds on calculus ideas from a subfield called Calculus of Variations.
3454300	3457300	So yeah, I mean, there's a lot of calculus.
3457300	3460300	There's even a field now called Mathematical Oncology,
3460300	3465300	which you could definitely look up and find practitioners.
3465300	3468300	Yes, yes, there's a question.
3477300	3481300	Hi, this is not your point exactly,
3481300	3488300	but I'm wondering how if time and space are not infinitely divisible,
3488300	3490300	Zeno's paradoxes get resolved,
3490300	3495300	and so I'm thinking particularly about the paradox of the flying arrow,
3495300	3502300	in which if it's in a moment of time at a certain point,
3502300	3505300	and then in the next moment of time at another point,
3505300	3508300	there's no motion between those,
3508300	3511300	and so it seems impossible for the arrow to move,
3511300	3515300	and Aristotle's resolution is just that you can keep dividing them,
3515300	3517300	and there's no real end.
3518300	3521300	Well, thank you for that question about Zeno's paradoxes.
3523300	3526300	I think you summarized the paradox of the arrow very well,
3526300	3532300	and I write about them at some length in infinite powers,
3532300	3536300	and I feel, I'll tell you what my take on them is,
3536300	3539300	but keep in mind that people have been arguing about Zeno's paradoxes
3539300	3543300	for about 2,500 years now,
3544300	3547300	so I don't claim that I've outdone Zeno or Aristotle
3547300	3549300	or Bertrand Russell or anyone in between,
3549300	3554300	but my take, one thing is, we don't have Zeno's writings.
3554300	3560300	We only know what Zeno was saying because of what Plato said about him
3560300	3562300	or Aristotle said about him,
3562300	3566300	and these were people who weren't predisposed toward treating Zeno kindly.
3566300	3569300	They bring him up to demolish him,
3569300	3572300	so I don't know that I trust their version of his paradoxes,
3572300	3577300	but as far as we can tell, he had at least four paradoxes,
3577300	3579300	which were structured like this.
3579300	3583300	Two paradoxes are supposed space and time are infinitely subdivisible,
3583300	3586300	and two of them are supposed the opposite,
3586300	3590300	supposed space and time are fundamentally particulate and discreet,
3590300	3592300	and then he has paradoxes for every occasion.
3592300	3598300	So the paradox of the arrow is under the premise that space and time are particulate,
3598300	3601300	that there's a particular moment in time,
3601300	3604300	and the arrow is at a particular location,
3604300	3608300	and then click on one of those digital clocks
3608300	3611300	that the second hand doesn't sweep continuously,
3611300	3613300	it goes tick, tick, tick, right?
3613300	3617300	That's the picture of time in Zeno's paradox of the arrow,
3617300	3622300	and under that paradox, at the next tick, the arrow's in a new place.
3622300	3625300	It has just materialized in a new location
3626300	3628300	without traversing the space in between
3628300	3631300	because, by assumption, there is no space in between.
3631300	3632300	Space is particulate.
3632300	3635300	So motion in a universe that is particulate
3635300	3639300	is doing exactly what Zeno said it would do, and there's no paradox.
3639300	3643300	He has described the way things would be in such a universe,
3643300	3645300	and the fact that we don't like it
3645300	3649300	is because we perceive space and time as being continuous,
3649300	3653300	but I don't think Zeno's paradox of the arrow is wrong.
3653300	3655300	I think it's logically correct.
3655300	3657300	So anyone who says that paradox is wrong
3657300	3660300	and tries to argue it with calculus
3660300	3662300	is not understanding Zeno's reasoning.
3662300	3664300	He's perfectly right about that.
3664300	3668300	Where he's not right is in the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise
3668300	3670300	or the dichotomy paradox.
3670300	3674300	Those are paradoxes, like the dichotomy paradox is,
3674300	3677300	I can't walk from here to there because before I get there,
3677300	3679300	I have to walk half the distance,
3679300	3681300	and I can't walk half the distance
3681300	3683300	because before I do that, I have to walk half of that.
3683300	3685300	You're always splitting in half.
3685300	3689300	Meanwhile, everyone does that every day.
3689300	3692300	They get out of bed and go eat breakfast, so we can do it.
3692300	3693300	So there's the paradox.
3693300	3696300	How can it be possible to do an infinite number of these things
3696300	3699300	before breakfast?
3699300	3703300	Zeno had trouble thinking about infinite sums
3703300	3705300	that converged to a finite thing
3705300	3709300	because that math was not really well developed at that point.
3709300	3712300	So I think Zeno is wrong about the...
3712300	3716300	If space and time are continuous, I think his paradoxes are faulty,
3716300	3720300	but I think his paradox of the arrow is correctly reasoned.
3720300	3722300	Stephen, over here.
3722300	3724300	Yes, please.
3724300	3727300	Thank you.
3727300	3736300	Calculus involves an infinite number of sums of infinite decimals,
3736300	3745300	and the universe has, beginning with Max Planck,
3745300	3753300	perhaps an invisibly small quantities of length and distance and so forth.
3753300	3759300	But as far as I understand, a fundamentally open question is
3759300	3763300	whether the universe itself is infinite or finite.
3763300	3769300	So can we use calculus to make predictions that are observable
3769300	3775300	through cosmology of whether our universe is finite or infinite?
3775300	3777300	Very interesting.
3777300	3780300	So to think about the infinitely big, not the infinitesimally small,
3780300	3783300	and in the case of cosmology.
3783300	3786300	First of all, I'm not an expert in that,
3786300	3792300	so I wouldn't presume to give you a clear answer on it.
3792300	3794300	I don't know what to say.
3794300	3796300	I mean, I think it's...
3796300	3799300	Well, what do our scientists tell us today that...
3799300	3801300	I mean, you see different things.
3801300	3805300	They tell us that the universe is 13.8 billion years old or something,
3805300	3811300	and a naive calculation would tell you so it should be 13.8 times...
3811300	3814300	You know, that many light years across in radius,
3814300	3816300	but then I'm told by my cosmology friends,
3816300	3818300	no, that's not right.
3818300	3823300	90 billion light years are some kind of crazy big number.
3823300	3826300	You don't just... because of something about inflation.
3826300	3829300	So I can't say I ever really understood that argument.
3829300	3832300	And then others will say, well, that's only just the visible universe
3832300	3836300	that we get from the cosmic microwave background and other data.
3836300	3839300	So if we really believe that that's just the visible universe,
3839300	3844300	but there's more stuff, like in a scenario where there's lots of bubble universes
3844300	3847300	that are causally decoupled from us,
3847300	3849300	conceivably it could be infinite.
3849300	3853300	I think there are respectable models that have infinite universes
3853300	3856300	in both time and space.
3856300	3858300	So I don't think calculus can answer that.
3858300	3860300	I think there are also respectable ones that are finite
3860300	3864300	that have big bang and big crunch pulsating universes.
3864300	3867300	So I don't think calculus can answer that one for us.
3867300	3871300	I don't see any logical contradiction in either of those.
3871300	3876300	It's up to the physicists and the cosmologists to take care of that one for us.
3877300	3879300	I saw some people nodding.
3879300	3883300	So I hope that was reasonably close to what science would say today.
3883300	3886300	I'm an amateur on that field.
3886300	3889300	Okay, we'll start here, and then Denise will cover that one.
3889300	3891300	Okay, good. Great questions.
3891300	3895300	How about the 1980 article about Wigner
3895300	3899300	about the unreasonable association of mathematics and natural science?
3899300	3902300	I'm not sure that's the correct title, but I think it's close.
3902300	3904300	Yeah, very close.
3904300	3907300	What was the question? Just you want my comments on Wigner's article?
3907300	3909300	The comments on that article.
3909300	3916300	Yeah, so Eugene Wigner, great scientist of one of the great Hungarian Jewish geniuses
3916300	3922300	that, along with people like von Neumann and Leo Zellart,
3922300	3925300	had this fantastic article from around 1960
3925300	3931300	that's called on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences.
3931300	3933300	I think that's the title.
3933300	3937300	The ringing phrase is on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.
3937300	3940300	So that's the question. Is it unreasonable or not?
3940300	3943300	Some people say, what's unreasonable?
3943300	3947300	The people who are big on the language point of view will say,
3947300	3950300	math is the language that we use to describe nature.
3950300	3953300	Why should we be surprised that it describes nature?
3953300	3957300	So they don't get it. They don't get what Wigner is talking about.
3957300	3962300	I think it's because those people don't know enough science, actually, or enough math.
3962300	3968300	The deeper you go, I mean, let me try to capture what Wigner is talking about.
3968300	3971300	Here's an example.
3971300	3976300	We have this theory that goes beyond quantum theory,
3976300	3981300	where in traditional quantum theory the electric and magnetic field are treated classically,
3981300	3983300	but other parts are treated quantum mechanically.
3983300	3986300	But if you quantize the electromagnetic field,
3986300	3990300	then you have this fancier theory called quantum electrodynamics, QED,
3990300	3993300	that Feynman worked on and others worked on.
3993300	3999300	In QED, we have certain calculations about quantities in physics,
3999300	4002300	something called the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron.
4002300	4005300	G-2 is the little formula for it.
4005300	4007300	It's not a very physically important quantity,
4007300	4013300	but it's interesting as a poster child for how good math can be in describing reality.
4013300	4017300	We can calculate this G-2 to, I think,
4017300	4024300	the current record is something like 12 digits after the decimal point.
4024300	4028300	One part in a trillion accuracy or something like that.
4028300	4033300	Does that spook you?
4033300	4034300	It should.
4034300	4039300	That math that is, according to some people, just a free creation of human imagination,
4039300	4046300	is matching click, click, click, click, click, click, click for 12 digits worth of what nature is doing.
4046300	4050300	So it's like nature knows math,
4050300	4054300	but really not just geometry, not just straight lines and stuff.
4054300	4058300	This is a very fancy part of math that seems like it's built in.
4058300	4061300	I don't know if that's the best example.
4061300	4064300	Maybe it's too arcane, that example.
4064300	4069300	Anyway, it's a feeling of awe that, certainly Einstein expressed in that famous saying
4069300	4074300	about the eternal mystery of the universe is that it's comprehensible.
4074300	4079300	He often quoted us the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.
4079300	4086300	So Einstein certainly felt it, and people like Dirac,
4086300	4092300	another example would be Dirac working in this area of quantum,
4092300	4094300	I mean it's a precursor to quantum electrodynamics.
4094300	4100300	He writes down a thing called the Dirac equation that merges special relativity with quantum theory,
4100300	4103300	the existence of something called antimatter,
4103300	4109300	that there should be in addition to an electron some exact bizarro world version of the electron
4109300	4114300	that has the same mass and the same charge except it's positive instead of negative.
4114300	4119300	And it had never been seen, and he just imagined it and the equations conjured it up and said it should be there.
4119300	4123300	And Dirac, very dry in his British way says something like,
4123300	4128300	would be curious or it would be surprising if nature did not make use of,
4129300	4133300	but it's sort of like, this math is so pretty you'd expect nature to do it.
4133300	4139300	And then a few years later, it's measured, there is a positron, you can find it, it's a real thing.
4139300	4144300	And today it's used in PET scanning if you've heard of people going in for sensitive kinds of magnetic imaging,
4144300	4147300	PET scanning, that's positron emission tomography.
4147300	4155300	So it's wild, the math conjured that thing out of nothingness, it was there waiting to be discovered.
4155300	4161300	I don't know what to say, so for me, yes, it's a profoundly practically religious feeling.
4161300	4168300	Like if I were inclined to believe in God, I would think this would be evidence, but I'm not.
4168300	4173300	But I don't know how to explain why math works so well at describing the universe.
4173300	4177300	It's confusing, I mean there could be circularity in the argument,
4177300	4181300	it could be that I'm only bringing up the cases where math works well.
4181300	4184300	So of course it works well in those cases.
4184300	4188300	I don't know, these are really deep questions.
4188300	4191300	Okay, here's a question.
4191300	4193300	Hi.
4193300	4194300	Oh yes please, go ahead.
4194300	4197300	I'm sorry, I saw a gentleman here in the middle, but go ahead.
4197300	4199300	My head is really exploding.
4199300	4201300	Your head's exploding, is that good?
4201300	4202300	Yes, that's it.
4202300	4204300	Okay, okay.
4204300	4210300	But just recently I've been listening to compositions by Carl Jenkins.
4210300	4211300	Could you hold your mic up a little closer?
4211300	4215300	Carl Jenkins, and they always talk about him being a mathematician.
4215300	4219300	I'm not a mathematician, I'm not a musician.
4219300	4224300	But 50 years ago, I also read Hermann Hesse and Magistral Ludi,
4224300	4229300	a glass bead game, and the connection between math and music.
4229300	4236300	So do you have any comments from the perspective of...
4236300	4239300	Is the question about the relation between math and music,
4239300	4241300	or between math and playing games?
4241300	4246300	No, it's math and music, and the patterns.
4246300	4249300	Do you have any insight there that you'd like to share with us?
4249300	4250300	I don't have much to say.
4250300	4252300	Certainly there's some kind of profound connection.
4252300	4254300	Certainly a lot of...
4254300	4257300	It's often pointed out that a few things,
4257300	4262300	that mathematicians are often particularly entranced with music.
4262300	4266300	There are plenty of musicians who are not that fond of math.
4266300	4269300	So that's not like a simple identification.
4269300	4272300	Leibniz has some quote that I can't remember exactly what it is,
4272300	4277300	but something like about that music is the soul.
4277300	4278300	Does someone remember the quote?
4278300	4281300	Music is math of the soul.
4281300	4282300	It's something about the...
4282300	4284300	Oh, do you have it?
4284300	4286300	Music is the soul of the last class.
4286300	4290300	Oh, please put the mic on her.
4290300	4291300	I love it.
4291300	4292300	Are you from St. John's?
4292300	4293300	Yeah.
4293300	4295300	This you see?
4295300	4297300	This is the kind of education you get at St. John's.
4297300	4299300	Please give us a quote.
4299300	4303300	So if I remember correct, Leibniz says music is the mind,
4303300	4307300	like, mathematicizing or calculating unconsciously.
4307300	4310300	And then Schopenhauer says music is the mind,
4310300	4313300	philosophizing unconsciously.
4313300	4315300	Nice.
4318300	4321300	So that's an interesting possible thought that...
4321300	4324300	Beautiful, thank you very much.
4324300	4326300	That is music the mind.
4326300	4327300	What is it?
4327300	4329300	Mathematizing unconsciously.
4329300	4332300	Certainly there's something about time and rhythm and pattern,
4332300	4336300	but it's a confusing question because math is...
4336300	4342300	I mean, music is so much more capable of moving us emotionally.
4342300	4345300	Math can move us in a certain way,
4345300	4348300	but it's not the same as listening to...
4348300	4350300	Right, even those of us who love math.
4350300	4353300	I have clapped at beautiful math.
4353300	4356300	I've never started weeping, but I could really get transported.
4356300	4358300	Well, not for that reason.
4358300	4359300	I don't know.
4359300	4361300	There's something very transporting.
4361300	4365300	Music feels transcendent in a different way than math is,
4365300	4368300	but other just random connections,
4368300	4370300	since you asked me what are my thoughts.
4370300	4372300	I'm also thinking of prodigies,
4372300	4377300	that the fields that have prodigies, math,
4377300	4381300	right, child prodigies, math, music,
4381300	4384300	the three-year-old Mozart, and chess.
4384300	4386300	And there may be some others,
4386300	4389300	but it's hard to be a great historian at two.
4389300	4394300	So some fields, especially fields that are about patterns,
4394300	4396300	subtle perceptions of patterns,
4396300	4399300	appreciation of symmetry pattern, things like that,
4399300	4403300	that are often outside of language or experience,
4403300	4405300	I mean spoken verbal language.
4405300	4406300	I don't know.
4406300	4410300	It's interesting to me that math and music and chess are those three.
4410300	4412300	There may be others, but I don't know.
4412300	4414300	I don't have that much to say about it.
4414300	4415300	Thank you.
4415300	4416300	Yeah, good question though.
4416300	4417300	Oh, yes, please.
4417300	4418300	Go ahead.
4418300	4422300	I have a chicken or the egg kind of a question for you.
4425300	4431300	Would any of the sciences or most of mathematics
4431300	4437300	be possible without the analysis of infinite series?
4438300	4439300	Aha.
4439300	4444300	So you're saying that the tool that we call infinite series
4444300	4446300	or the mathematical concept of infinite series,
4446300	4448300	would what be possible without it?
4448300	4450300	Everything else.
4450300	4451300	Higher math or something?
4451300	4453300	Well, the sciences.
4453300	4454300	The sciences.
4454300	4457300	How much of the sciences depends on the use of infinite series?
4457300	4459300	Calculus, it seems to me.
4459300	4460300	Calculus, yeah.
4460300	4462300	It very much uses infinite series.
4462300	4464300	I think it's kind of a basis of...
4465300	4467300	They're important for sure.
4467300	4468300	They're very important.
4468300	4473300	They're one strategy of using the infinity principle.
4473300	4475300	I wouldn't say that they're the only strategy,
4475300	4482300	but Newton used infinite series very much in his first development of calculus.
4482300	4485300	Then he later created fluctuations,
4485300	4488300	which were based on analogies with motion and time,
4488300	4491300	and then ultimately he did a geometric version of calculus
4491300	4494300	that is in the Principia where he's trying to persuade people
4494300	4497300	with what looks like Euclidean rigor,
4497300	4500300	except it has a lot of infinitesimal arguments in it.
4500300	4504300	So he certainly used infinite series a lot.
4504300	4506300	It's worth pointing out.
4506300	4509300	I've only mentioned European scientists so far
4509300	4512300	with Maxwell and Ersted and Company,
4512300	4518300	but let's not forget that in India there were people like Madhava
4518300	4521300	around 1300 or 1400,
4521300	4524300	so fully more than 200 years before Newton and Leibniz,
4524300	4528300	working with the infinite series that you like so much.
4528300	4534300	So Madhava came up with infinite series for sine and cosine
4534300	4537300	and arc tangent for astronomical reasons.
4537300	4541300	These are the great Hindu mathematicians of Kerala, India,
4541300	4543300	big tradition in math and astronomy.
4544300	4547300	You've got to appreciate that calculus is world culture.
4547300	4550300	The Arabic mathematicians did a lot.
4553300	4556300	I would single out a guy named Ibn al-Haitham,
4556300	4558300	often called Alhazen in the West.
4558300	4563300	Very important work also using infinite series and sums generally.
4563300	4568300	He could do integrals or find volumes that Archimedes didn't know how to do.
4568300	4572300	Anyway, I know that we often tell it very Eurocentric,
4572300	4576300	but I think the truth is the European mathematicians
4576300	4579300	put the finishing touches on calculus,
4579300	4582300	but a lot of it was developed elsewhere in the world.
4585300	4587300	First, the sake of honesty, let me say this definition
4587300	4589300	I've given about the infinity principle,
4589300	4591300	that that's the heart of calculus,
4591300	4594300	that's a singular point of view, that is not widely shared.
4594300	4598300	I believe it's right, but most historians will tell you calculus
4598300	4603300	is a phenomenon of Germany and England in the 1600s
4603300	4605300	from Leibniz and Newton,
4605300	4609300	in particular the discovery of the thing called the fundamental theorem of calculus,
4609300	4613300	which connects the two parts, the differential and integral part of calculus,
4613300	4616300	and lets us do things like infinite sums
4616300	4620300	through a certain trick that is called the anti-derivative,
4620300	4622300	that makes the calculations much easier
4622300	4626300	and you don't have to be a genius of the caliber of Archimedes or Ibn al-Haitham.
4626300	4630300	Now you can teach that calculus to ordinary school children
4630300	4634300	of no particular great intellect and they can do it,
4634300	4637300	which they could never do in Archimedean argument.
4637300	4640300	We've made calculus so streamlined and so easy,
4640300	4643300	maybe not you didn't think so when you took it,
4643300	4646300	but believe me it's much easier now than it was.
4646300	4649300	That's what most historians would tell you is the beginning of calculus,
4649300	4651300	but I just think that's wrong.
4651300	4655300	I think that's the culmination of 2,000 years of great work.
4657300	4659300	Shall we take one last question?
4668300	4673300	So going back to your example with the area of a circle,
4673300	4676300	one thing you took for granted was pi.
4676300	4677300	Oh yes.
4677300	4680300	So I was just curious how Archimedes, whoever it was,
4680300	4684300	that was deriving this initially, what method they used.
4684300	4686300	Sure, great question, yeah.
4686300	4692300	So right, I took for granted the pi in the calculation, the number pi, 3.14, etc.
4692300	4698300	So Archimedes absolutely gave a very systematic way of thinking about the number pi,
4698300	4705300	where he tried to, so in the same little manuscript or treatise
4705300	4708300	where he's calculated an area of a circle,
4708300	4712300	he also calculates the circumference, though he doesn't think of it as a,
4712300	4715300	I mean it's interesting, to him pi is not a number.
4715300	4717300	That's a whole complicated story.
4717300	4720300	But he looks at a ratio, he's very interested in proportions, right?
4720300	4722300	You know the Greeks think a lot about proportions.
4722300	4729300	And for him, he looks at the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter,
4729300	4735300	and he does it by putting in shapes that he understands that have straight sides,
4735300	4738300	like a square, actually what he starts with is a hexagon,
4738300	4741300	that almost looks like a circle, sitting inside the circle,
4741300	4745300	and another hexagon sitting outside the circle, tangent to the circle,
4745300	4747300	the inscribed and circumscribed hexagon.
4747300	4749300	And then he systematically doubles the number of sides,
4749300	4753300	so he goes from a 6-gon to a 12-gon to a 24-gon.
4753300	4758300	And you can picture as you add more and more corners to these polygons,
4758300	4761300	they start to look more and more like a real circle.
4761300	4765300	And he could calculate an iterative formula if he knows the area,
4765300	4767300	knows the circumference for a 6-gon,
4767300	4769300	it gives him the formula for the 12-gon,
4769300	4773300	and he works his way up till he eventually gets to the 96-gon,
4773300	4776300	and he shows that pi, this is a great formula,
4776300	4781300	he shows what we would today call pi is trapped between two numbers.
4781300	4788300	It's between the number 3 and 10 seventieths and 3 and 10 over 71,
4788300	4792300	which is cool because the 70 and the 71 are right next to each other.
4792300	4794300	So it's between 3 and 10 seventieths,
4794300	4796300	which you might recognize as 3 and 1 seventh,
4796300	4801300	or 22 sevenths, which a lot of people mistakenly think is equal to pi.
4801300	4804300	That's not correct, it's a bound on pi,
4804300	4807300	but that's Archimedes bound, 22 sevenths.
4807300	4810300	And then the other bound, which is a smaller, that's an upper bound,
4810300	4815300	and the smaller number, 3 plus 10 over 71, is a lower bound,
4815300	4818300	and pi is somehow trapped in between those two numbers.
4818300	4822300	So he does it by these inscribed and circumscribed 96-gons,
4822300	4827300	and it requires a lot of detailed approximations of square roots
4827300	4831300	using rational numbers that are still, people are debating,
4831300	4834300	how did he do it exactly, because he doesn't show his work.
4834300	4836300	Teachers out there, I know some of you are teachers,
4836300	4839300	see there's Beth, right, you would have taken off for Archimedes,
4839300	4841300	didn't show all his work.
4842300	4844300	Yeah, so we don't exactly know,
4844300	4847300	but he was a wizard with those approximations of fractions
4847300	4849300	of square roots and things,
4849300	4851300	but he got everything is right that he said.
4851300	4855300	If you don't appreciate Archimedes, he's really fantastic.
4855300	4859300	I would put him in the top three or four of all time in math,
4859300	4864300	he's really something with Newton and Riemann and Gauss,
4864300	4868300	those are really, but oiler too, those are like my top five.
4870300	4872300	For what it's worth.
4872300	4874300	Can we have another round of applause for Steve?
4877300	4879300	Thank you.
