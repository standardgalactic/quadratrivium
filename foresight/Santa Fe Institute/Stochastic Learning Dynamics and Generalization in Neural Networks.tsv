0	4320	What I'm going to tell you about is some recent work
4320	6560	we have done in trying to understand the learning
6560	10160	dynamics in the neural network, feed forward neural network,
10160	12880	from your based on a statistical physics point of view.
12880	16080	So you will see.
16080	18480	Got it, OK.
18480	23240	OK, so I will start with some basic introduction.
23240	26600	What I call the central dogma of machine learning.
26600	28520	Focus on two main things, but I think
28520	31040	is very important, which I think physicists
31040	34640	can contribute to optimization and generalization,
34640	36000	to understand these two things.
36000	39080	And then I'll talk along and talk about the topic.
39080	42280	One is really about the dynamics of learning in feed
42280	43960	forward neural network.
