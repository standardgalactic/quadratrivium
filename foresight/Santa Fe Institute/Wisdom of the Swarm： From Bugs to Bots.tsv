0	5280	at Cambridge University and he's been a professor of physics at Harvard University for the past
5280	12240	20 plus years I guess. Two facts about him that you might not know or maybe you do know is one
12240	18320	of MacArthur, genius of course, 1009. And the other thing is that he's also recipient of the
18320	30960	Ike Bilbell Prize in 2007 and what he wanted for was understanding wrinkly of sheets and manifolds
30960	36720	when they land on surfaces so every time I look in the mirror I'll keep the view.
37920	41680	That's pretty cool. I hope everybody else does the same from now on. Okay, thank you Sid.
42480	49360	It's a very small group so I hope that you will make this more of a multi-log and just
49360	57920	interrupt me as you feel the need to and correct me which I'm sure you will. So I wanted to tell
57920	64640	you something about some problems that I've been working on for more than a decade. All inspired
64640	74400	by originally Edward Lear and the wonderful poetry that he wrote in the 19th century associated
74400	81200	with collective nouns for groups of animals. So I'm going to show you one and I'm going to ask
81200	90080	you a question. So these are starlings from a BBC documentary above Rome so probably everybody
90080	96320	over here does know what the collective noun for starlings is. Memorization. What is it for rhinos?
100320	109680	A crash. What is it for owls? Parliament. Yeah, so I think what is it for?
110480	121600	I'm going to say, well, no, I'm not going to go, never mind. So the point about these
121600	126160	collectives is that it says something about function and that's very important and that's
126160	132400	what I want to try and emphasize over the next hour or so that even though from the
132400	139280	perspective that certainly I'm going to tell you a little bit about from physics, from mathematics,
139280	146160	you can ask about what kinds of and what forms of order do you see in collectives of organisms
146160	155600	on any scale from microbes to robots. But as the language, as English actually has got so many,
155600	159840	and I'm sure this is true of every language, has got so many different forms for collectives
159840	164960	different depending on the organism, it's associated with function. So why do these
164960	169280	collectives exist? Presumably they're associated with every collective there's a function. And
169280	172160	also from a physics point of view, you can ask a mathematics point of view, you can ask how do
172160	176080	they form. So there are three kinds of questions that you can ask about any kinds of collective
176080	184000	behavior in particular associated with collections of animals. And what I'd like to do is to ask
184000	188800	two different types of questions associated with collective behavior. One is how is collective
188800	195920	behavior constrained by physics. And the other is how does physics enable function in the context
195920	201760	of collective behavior. And I think it's interesting to point out a framework for this which has been
201760	208640	laid out a long time ago outside of physics by Nicholas Tinbergen, one of two brothers, both
208640	216720	of whom got the Nobel Prize. Tinbergen got the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine and he shared
216800	224800	it with Conrad Lorenz and Frisch in 1967 and 1968. And he raised a set of questions which have formed
224800	232080	the bedrock of ethology in studying behavior in animals. He was originally thinking about single
232080	236320	animals, individuals, but we can ask the same question in the context of collective. So he asked,
236320	241760	you know, what is a behavior in terms of its function? So, you know, how can you describe
241840	248640	that function? Why does that function arise? How does that function come to be in the context
248640	253680	of causation? And then both a proximal and a distal perspective in an organism, how does that
254640	260400	behavior develop? And how does it essentially arise across different species in an evolutionary
260400	264080	setting? But you don't have to limit yourself to organisms. You can of course ask the same
264080	268800	question in the context of collections of organisms. And what I want to do is to make this
268800	272000	very specific because I'm thinking about function in the context of architectures
273200	277040	because they are very concrete, quite literally often in, for example, with the human
278480	284000	situation. But in the animal situation, you also have remarkable sets of architectures which are
284000	290880	formed from the scale of microbes. We can essentially create biofilms to ants, to bees. I'm going to
290880	295760	focus on social insects, to termites. And I've shown you three different scales. Each one of them
295760	302720	has organisms on the scale of hundreds, two thousands or even millions. In this case associated
302720	307360	with maximizing transport from one location on a tree to another. In this case, which I'll come
307360	313920	back to associated with understanding how to minimize heating and cooling conditions within
313920	319680	the inside and or mechanically being stable when responding to a wind. And in this case,
319680	324960	a combination of making sure that you are simultaneously not fully insulated from the
325040	329360	environment, but not fully porous to the environment so that the vagaries and the fluctuations
329360	332480	associated with the environment can be buffered to some extent by architectures.
334240	339840	So these functional collectives in general, lots of work has been gone on from a biological
339840	346640	perspective, tend to roughly be capable of being broken up into ways of controlling how
347520	352320	in a physical context, energy matter information can be transferred with an uncertain environment.
352320	358480	And that environment and the ways in which the collectives form are or have to be adaptable in
358480	362240	a way which I'll become, which has become clearer and also are spatially heterogeneous. So they're
362240	369760	not just temporal, but also complex spatial patterns that form. And moving away from our
369760	374000	perspective and thinking about energy matter information, if I'm thinking about these systems
374000	379200	in a biological context, we have to start thinking about how you can or not get coordination and
379200	383760	communication in the context of these functional self-organized patterns. And an important thing
383760	387360	that I think I don't have to convince anybody over here, but worth pointing out right at the
387360	392400	beginning is in none of these cases, is there any evidence of a plan or a planner? There is
393840	397440	some sensing, there is some action at the individual level, which gradually
398160	402000	transcends the individual and at the collective level leads to these functional patterns.
402880	407200	And the most important part is that you can't leave out the environment. And that's what I'm
407200	410320	going to talk about in three different examples. So you have to think about the organism, you've
410320	415680	got to think about the organism interacting with other conspecifics, and then eventually you've
415680	419280	got to think about how it interacts with the environment. It changes the environment and
419280	423040	is changed by the environment. And you have to see these three examples, we immediately see that,
423040	428640	to understand that. Okay, so as I said, typical kind of question that we can ask is both ways,
428640	434720	how does collective behavior enabled and how does collective behavior constrained by physics?
435680	438320	Okay, I want to talk about social insects
440400	445280	for a reason which I don't think again is necessary for me to elaborate too much,
446080	451920	primarily because you have a remarkable, so these are the big four classes of social insects,
451920	456480	these wasps, ants, and termites. But from the point of view of the perspective that I came
456480	459840	to this from, I started out thinking about morphogenesis and thinking about multicellular
459840	463760	organisms. And there are lots of parallels between multicellular organisms and super
463760	470400	organisms, where these super organisms have a separation between the germline and the soma,
470400	475280	just like in multicellular organisms as well. Here you have often usually a queen,
475280	480800	and that's the only organism in colony that's capable of reproductive behavior. But then
480800	489440	everything else is shared, you have common nests, they are unlike in us, social insects are clonal,
489440	492960	you have reproductive mission of labor, as I said before, you have cooperative brood care,
492960	496320	you have overlapping generations, and the consequence of the last two is that you have
496320	500240	a sense of culture, and that culture is transmitted not through genetics, but through other means.
501600	507840	Okay, as a consequence of having these very large collections of organisms, you find that
507840	512160	they are extraordinary problem solvers. They can solve problems in physiology that are impossible
512160	516640	to solve on the scale of an individual organism, but can be solved collectively on the scale of
516640	523360	hundreds to millions of organisms. And as I said, I want to tell you about architectures,
524240	528000	and architectures are wonderful because you can essentially figure out a way to connect physiology
528000	532160	to physics, in this case the physiology is the architecture which is living, but not necessarily
532160	535920	made only of living things. It's essentially the environment which is dynamically changing,
535920	540480	and I'm going to show you examples of how these architectures allow for respiration and ventilation
540480	544720	on scales much larger than organisms in the context of bees, thermoregulation also in the
544720	548400	context of bees, and mechanoregulation in the context of termites and bees.
551920	556560	I've said this before, I want to emphasize this again. We should be thinking about the fact that
556560	560720	in all these examples that I'll tell you about, the environment is a malleable substrate, so it
560720	566240	can be changed by the organism, and a consequence of that is it changes the behavior of the organism,
566240	571680	and so the environment serves as a slow communication channel. The dynamics of the
571680	574640	environment is slow, typically compared to the dynamics of the organism,
576320	580240	modulo being close to where we are in the context of climate change and tipping points and what
580240	584560	not, but in general you have a separation of timescales associated with these things.
584560	588480	Okay, so the three examples that I want to tell you about which involve
588480	592720	connecting experiment and theory in very different places, and very different times over the last
592720	598880	decade. First example that I want to tell you about is associated with termite mounds. This
598880	603920	is an image of a termite mound from here, from Bangalore. We started out doing experiments over
603920	611200	here and then in Namibia and then parts of Western Africa. This is an image of a termite mound during
611200	618560	the day. This is an image of the termite mound at night viewed through an infrared camera superposed
618560	624880	on a regular image, and what you can see is essentially changes in temperature, so this
624880	630160	part is at night warm and cold, depending on time of the day or time of the night. Now I'll
630160	634880	come back to this, and this is work that was done with Sam Oko, who was a PhD student, and Alex
634880	638240	Hyde, also a PhD student, and I'll come back to that. So what are the questions over here? The
638240	645360	questions are what is the structure for, how is it built, and how does this all work out in the
645360	649200	context of a larger ecological question of the environment? This is a termite mound.
649840	654320	Oh, what? I'm going to show you all this. I'm going to tell you about the anatomy,
654320	658160	I'm going to tell you about the physiology, so hold the question. And please do stop me
658160	661440	with questions at any point. Some of them I will answer immediately, but some,
661440	664480	if you don't mind, I'll wait because I will have something to say about that.
664480	670080	The second problem that I want to tell you about was done in collaboration with Orif Pelleg, who I
670080	675040	know is an external faculty member over here. She started this when she was a postdoc. Now she's
675040	680480	in Colorado, and Jake Peters was a graduate student, and this is understanding ventilation, but not
680480	686480	for termite mounds, ventilation in bee hives or bee boxes, and this was done not so far from Boston
686480	692480	in our Concord Field Station. And then if I have time, I'll tell you about a third problem where
692480	696400	we essentially brought everything into the lab. Initially we wanted to do this, but we haven't
696400	700640	been able to. The third problem is associated with the third class of social insects. We haven't
700640	705040	had a chance to work on wasps yet. I would love to find a way to do so. And the third problem is
705040	709600	associated with understanding how architectures can be broken and built in the context of ants,
709600	714000	which want to try and escape from a coral in which they are essentially initially placed.
714720	718800	And then I want to gradually move from thinking about ants to robotic mimics of this. And the
718800	723520	question over there is what are the necessary, what is the minimum necessary set of rules,
723520	727760	and what is the minimum sufficient set of rules associated with having a programmable set of
727760	732000	agents that can interact with each other and interact with an environment to be able to capture
732000	738320	some aspects of the dynamics of organisms interacting with each other and with an environment,
738320	741840	all of which are malleable. And this is work that continues, actually. It started out with
741840	748080	Ganga Prasad and Sovik Mandal. Fabio built robots, and this was all a very close collaboration with
748880	753040	a colleague of mine in biology, Venkimofi, who was very interested in collectively.
753600	760800	Okay. So I'll give you the final result or way to think about, at least the way I've
760800	765360	approached this problem. And then you can come back to the talk periodically. If you feel like
765680	771040	a, every one of these I claim, and I'll show you evidence for, even though the problems that are
771040	775600	solved on much larger scales associated with very simple local sensing rules and local actuation
775600	780880	rules. And the key ingredient that I would like to emphasize is global physics, physics associated
780880	787520	with how heat is moving around, how vibrations are moving around, how fluid dynamics plays a role,
787520	791920	and coupled with simple local sensing and local actuation rules and global physics,
791920	796080	you can get both function and architecture as the claim. And I want to essentially tell you how
796080	802720	we think about this in all these problems. Okay. So termite mounds are remarkable. They are an
802720	808160	ecosystem on their own. You can actually have collections of collections, if you want. These
808160	815520	are collections of termite mounds from Australia. They're called magnetic termite mounds, wall
815520	819600	termite mounds, which seem to be oriented roughly in a particular angle with respect to magnetic
819600	826320	knots. So each mound can have millions of individuals. A termite itself is the size of a
826320	833200	fingernail. And you find them everywhere except in Antarctica. Probably the most remarkable example
833200	842400	of recent work in this space. This is England, Great Britain. This is the coast of South America.
843360	848480	This is a set of termite mounds which was excavated five or six years ago.
849520	853920	Look at the scale. It is not one mound. There are many mounds. A whole bunch of them.
854960	859280	Hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. So they essentially have the capacity to completely
859280	864080	change the ecology of the environment in which they are. So you can ask questions on the very,
864080	868160	very large scale. You can ask questions on the intermediate scale or on the very small scale.
868160	870880	And I'll talk about the intermediate and the small scale. What happens on the scale of an
870880	875920	individual termite mound when I coarse-grain and look at it? What happens at the level of
875920	880160	termites interacting with each other and with the termite mound as they build it? Those are the
880160	883120	two scales in which I want to tell you about. I won't tell you anything about on the very large
883120	890640	scale. So answering Sid's question, we started out, as I said, working on it in India with a
890640	895920	particular species, Odontoktermis obesis. You know, a few millimeters in size. Termite mounds are
895920	901200	hollow, but they are hollow on different scales. You don't have a chimney at the top,
901760	907040	contrary to what sometimes is shown in children's books. This is a view from the top. You don't
907040	911200	also have to have this very fluted structure. So for example, this is one from Namibia.
911760	915760	It's more or less axi-symmetric. Certainly it doesn't have flutes. These ones are not.
916800	920000	Under what conditions do you get it? Under what conditions you don't? I don't really have a sense
920000	925360	of that. The ecologists and the natural historians haven't actually really, I think, quantified
925360	929520	where and when you get this. So it's porous on multiple scales, and you can ask many questions.
929520	932800	You know, what is this good for from a physiology point of view? How might it be built from a
932800	936160	morphogenesis point of view? And what are the effects on ecology? And this is the question
936160	942880	that I will not answer. I'll try and answer some of these two. Okay, so start with anatomy. So this
942880	947520	is the anatomy of a termite mound. The most interesting part of the mound is not what you see
947520	953200	above. It's below. It's what's called the gallery. And within this gallery is where the brood is,
953200	957680	where most of the termites are most of the time. And along with the brood and the termites,
957680	963680	you also have fungus. Essentially, the termites will bring water and fungi from their environment
963680	968560	in the neighborhood of an individual mound, and they will use this to feed the brood and keep
968560	977200	the entire environment moist. The gallery itself, you can't, of course, see until it erupts into
977200	980480	a mound. So there's a very difficult question over here, which nobody's really addressed,
980480	984800	which is on what are the conditions for the eruption of a mound? And nobody's been able
984800	989360	to really build a mound in the lab. There are some attempts partially successful.
989360	994400	Continuing to answer the questions that you raised, a collaborator of mine, I'm sorry,
994400	1001200	his name is not here, Rupert Soar basically took a mound, which we knew was not inhabited anymore.
1001200	1006480	And how do we know this? We know this by essentially looking to see whether it starts to degrade over
1006480	1010000	a period of time. And if there is no repair, then you know it very likely it's been abandoned.
1011120	1018720	You can pour gypsum into it, allow that to precipitate. And then you can wash out the mud.
1018720	1024720	And this is the negative image of a termite mound. So you have vast, almost vertical channels,
1024720	1029520	which are themselves connected to each other. The termite mound is micro porous on the outside.
1029520	1033760	And as you go further and further inside, it becomes more and more macro porous. So the porosity
1033760	1039040	is got a gradient, small, many pores on the outside. As you go deeper and deeper, the pores
1039040	1044800	become larger and larger. And you have essentially vertical channels. And of course, this would
1044800	1048400	suggest that it has a very important part in ventilation. I'll show you some images associated
1048400	1055440	with that. So what is the physiology of this? Best way to describe this is to ask my favorite
1055440	1062880	naturalist and probably everybody's. Here in South Africa, it can also get very hot,
1062880	1069040	but there's no danger of flooding. So termites can take refuge from the heat below ground,
1069040	1075920	where it's cool and relatively stable. But two million insects living below ground
1075920	1083360	create a different kind of problem. The air around them gets stale. So termites need to have a way
1083360	1089760	of linking the underground air with the fresh air above a ventilation system. And they do that
1091120	1096720	with this. And to see how it works, you've got to look inside.
1100000	1105040	Using the latest scanning techniques, we can create a picture of the mound's interior.
1106000	1110400	An intricate network of passages lead to a central chimney.
1112320	1117840	Hot stale air from the insect population below rises up through the chimney.
1121840	1130240	But the top of the mound is sealed. So how does this stale air escape? The mound may look as though
1130320	1136080	it has strong defensive walls like a fortress. But in fact, these walls are porous, and their
1136080	1142800	primary purpose is to harness the wind. Fresh air blowing against the side of the mound
1142800	1148880	is forced through the tiny holes in these walls. From there, it travels through the smaller tunnels
1148880	1157440	until it reaches the central chimney. Here, the cooler fresh air mixes with the hot stale air
1157520	1164480	rising from the insect community below. Meanwhile, some air is blown around the side of the mound.
1165040	1171520	This creates a suction that pulls the stale air out of the chimney and out through the outer walls.
1172160	1176880	So an internal air current is created and the whole mound ventilated.
1178720	1183200	The mound's inhabitants spend most of their time close to or below ground level.
1184160	1188800	So he said, to De Bilan Mero said two things. First, he said that you have to have transport
1188800	1193200	across the wall, which is porous, which of course makes a lot of sense. But in fact,
1193200	1197040	as you know, because the pores are small, hydrodynamic effects are all going to be
1197040	1200800	dominated by viscous forces. They're not going to be dominated by inertia. And he then said something
1200800	1205840	else, which should have gotten all your antlers or your antenna up. And he said something about the
1205840	1210800	fact that, oh, if I have air moving around it, then the velocity of the air is high,
1210800	1214160	the pressure is low, and it's going to be suction. That can't be correct. And you can do an estimate
1214160	1222720	of that. And so clearly, if you have porosity, part of the argument associated with transport,
1223360	1226960	because of differences in concentration, is correct. But the airflow argument associated with
1226960	1232480	Bernoulli is wrong. And so this is the kind of argument which has been around in the literature
1232480	1236320	for a while. And we decided we'd go and measure things. We went to Namibia and we measured. What
1236320	1241280	did we measure? So you can measure the fluid flow velocities outside. You can essentially drill
1241280	1246720	holes into the termite mounds. And you can put in temperature sensors. And you can also have
1246720	1251760	velocity sensors to measure. I want to emphasize velocity sensors, not just speed, but direction
1251760	1257360	of the motion of the air inside. And then you can ask whether this is correct or not. And I'm going
1257360	1262960	to summarize the story, because it's almost a decade old now. And the story is that the argument
1262960	1268240	that Attenborough put forward is only partly correct. An important part was missed. And what
1268240	1271840	is the important part that was missed? In fact, let me show you an image. And then I'm going to
1271840	1275360	walk you through the argument. You know, our measurements and so on are there in this paper,
1275360	1279840	which is, as I said, published almost a decade ago. I showed you this image in the beginning.
1279840	1285520	This is a termite mound using regular light. This is an infrared during the day. And this is at
1285520	1291360	night. And so what really happens is the following. The mound is heated during the day and it cools
1291360	1296560	at night. But because the mound has a large thermal mass and therefore a thermal inertia,
1296560	1300720	the entire mound can't be heated simultaneously. It has to be heated from the outside and gradually
1300720	1305600	moves inwards. And so there's going to be a lag. If my thermal inertia is large enough,
1305600	1311040	then the outside is warm during the day, the inside is cold, hasn't had chance to heat up,
1311040	1314480	and exactly the reverse at night, because the inside is starting to warm up
1314480	1318560	during the day, outside starts to cool quickly. That means you have thermal gradients.
1318640	1323280	And these thermal gradients in space are a function of temperature variations in time.
1323280	1329840	So in fact, the termite mound actually is a heat engine, which instead of working between two,
1330880	1334560	a source and a sink in temperature, as we are used to thinking in thermodynamics,
1334560	1339600	which are kept at constant temperature, now in fact, the source and sink are oscillating.
1339600	1345920	And the mound is harnessing this temperature variation in time to create spatial flows
1345920	1351280	inside the mound, which we measure. So during the day, the outside of the mound is hot,
1351280	1357040	the air right inside is warm. As a consequence, air is going to rise. But because the air can't
1357040	1361840	leave because of the microporosity, so during the day, you have cycles like this, which we measure.
1363280	1368400	And at night, the outside starts to cool, so the mound air, sorry, the air in the mound just
1368400	1372640	inside starts to cool, it starts to sink, and the whole thing reverses. And so when will this
1372640	1377520	happen? It's not going to happen continuously, it's going to happen at dusk and a dawn, or slightly
1377520	1384560	after dusk and slightly before dawn, which means that the mound is a lung, and it's a lung driven
1384560	1391760	by temperature variations. And the mound essentially breathes twice a day. In us, our lungs work
1391760	1395280	primarily because of our diaphragm. Our diaphragm is essentially fundamentally what is essentially
1395280	1399680	pushing and pulling air in and out of the lungs. And instead of the diaphragm providing the muscular
1399680	1404320	forces in us, over here, temperature variations are essentially giving rise to the same thing.
1404320	1409600	And so we measured this in dead mounds. To be sure that we were right, we said, ah, in a live
1409600	1412800	mound, if this is the same thing, if this is happening in a live mound, which we know is live,
1412800	1417440	as I said, because it's under construction, we can see termites. In a dead mound, we see exactly
1417440	1422080	the same thing. Both in a live and a dead mound, we see the same thing. And we did this with two
1422080	1427200	different species on two different continents. We did this in Africa, in Namibia. We did this
1427280	1434960	in India with a different species. In Africa, in the temperate region, temperature variations are
1434960	1439840	much larger. And I'm going to come back to this. So therefore, you have much larger variations
1439840	1443440	to temperature between day and night. The consequence of that is the velocity should be much
1443440	1447040	larger. In India, the temperature variations are much smaller. The velocity should be smaller.
1447040	1452800	All that checks out. And the idea that it works like a lung, here is the evidence for this.
1452800	1457520	So what I'm showing you over here is what's happening in the nest and the gallery and what's
1457520	1462800	happening in the chimney. The carbon dioxide concentration starts to go up during the day,
1463440	1470080	as the termites are physiologically active. And then when at about 6 or 7 p.m., when this entire
1470080	1476320	cycle reverses, instead of having flows like this, the flows reverse, you excavate the bottom,
1476320	1480000	you excavate the gallery. And when you excavate the gallery, the carbon dioxide comes up. And
1480000	1483520	when the carbon dioxide comes up, the concentration of carbon dioxide inside is high compared to
1483520	1488240	outside. Now the porosity kicks in because the concentration difference allows you to
1488240	1494080	essentially equilibrate. So you have large-scale flows coupled to small-scale diffusion,
1494080	1500240	all driven by a heat source and a heat sink, which are fluctuating. So this is an interesting
1500240	1507680	observation, if only because it suggests that unlike our heat engines, animals don't have to work
1507680	1513360	at constant source and constant sink temperatures, you can have fluctuating versions of this.
1514000	1518480	Okay, so I'll leave it at that. A second question that this raises is when I said, ah,
1518480	1522800	the thermal inertia is large, if the thermal inertia was not large, of course, temperatures
1522800	1525920	will equilibrate quickly. And if temperature equilibrate quickly, you don't have to have any
1525920	1531040	of this. And so that begs the question, how in the world do termites figure out how to
1531040	1536400	build a structure of this kind so that it actually works? And I want to introduce another
1536400	1541120	naturalist, evolutionary biologist, who basically poses the question and then I'll show you
1541120	1547280	an attempt at an answer. Okay. Now what's fascinating to me about this is that if you came
1547280	1554720	across a building like that, you'd assume that some architect had designed it and he'd had a blueprint
1554720	1560240	of some kind, right, the drawing of how it was going to go, and he told people exactly what to do.
1560800	1566160	Now, this termite mine, nobody had an image of the complete building. I mean, no termite has a
1566160	1572160	picture of the whole mound. All the termites do is they, they build a mound and they're following
1572160	1579280	some rules. And to be honest, I don't think we know exactly what those rules are. My guess is that
1579280	1585920	they're fairly, fairly simple. So he gives it at that. What are they doing? What are they doing?
1586160	1592320	Fairly simple. So he gives it at that. What are the rules? How can we essentially now connect
1592320	1597200	the building behavior to the environmental changes? Because the building behavior will
1597200	1601120	change the environment. The environment will then feed back and change the behavior. For
1601120	1605360	example, if I build a mound, there are only certain places that the termites can get to.
1605360	1612160	So can we now understand how to couple the physics of the environment to the behavioral
1612160	1617280	biology of the organism? So don't separate out, this part is living and this part is not living.
1620160	1625520	So here's a cartoon. And here's a phrase which essentially summarizes everything.
1626240	1630480	You know, so Churchill famously said, we shape our buildings after they shape us. Well,
1630480	1635520	in the context of termites, the mound morphology clearly will influence the airflow. I've already
1635520	1639600	shown you, at least I wave my hands and told you how it works. We have some measurements of that.
1639600	1643200	The airflow is going to change the olfactory currents. It's going to change the pheromone
1643200	1647680	concentrations. The pheromone concentrations are going to change the termite behavior. And the termite
1647680	1652640	behavior is going to change the mind morphology. So you can't anymore separate out the organism
1652640	1656320	from the environment just as we can't separate out the brain from the body. We have to think
1656320	1660400	about all these things together. So how do we unpack this? And I'll show you two ways of unpacking
1660400	1665360	this. First is understanding the coarse-grained morphology of the termite mound. And second,
1665360	1669440	I'm going to show you CAT scans of the mound itself. And then I'm going to see how to unpack
1669440	1675280	the fine-grained morphology. First thing that you notice is that termite mounds are conical.
1676800	1680800	The aspect ratio is, they're not spheres. In fact, I'm going to show you examples.
1680800	1685680	Termite mounds, which you see in environments which are shady or termite mounds on trees,
1685680	1690240	they're much closer to spherical. So first question is, how come they become tall? And
1690880	1695360	I don't have to, I think, explain to this audience that one way to break symmetry is to use buoyancy.
1696560	1702480	Because as soon as I heat the air, heat air is going to move up and down much faster than sideways.
1702480	1706880	And if I essentially have buoyancy, that means I can move pheromones much faster in one direction
1706880	1711360	compared to the other. That means, therefore, I'll be able to build more in one direction compared
1711360	1715200	to the other if the pheromones were essentially responsible for the behavior of the termite.
1715840	1720240	And as a consequence, and I'll show you some scaling laws for that in just a minute,
1720240	1724880	as a consequence, you would expect that as you move from environments where the temperature
1724880	1728720	variations are small to environment where temperature variations are large,
1728720	1733920	the mound should become larger. This has been known for 100 years. If you go to the savanna,
1733920	1738560	you go to parts of southern Africa, you go to the temperate zones, the mounds can be 3,
1738560	1742960	3.5, 4 meters. You go to India, they are smaller. You go to a tree, they're even smaller. So already
1742960	1747280	you say, ah, that the physics of the environment is playing a very important role. Can I essentially
1747280	1754160	unpack that? So here is an attempt to do that. I've already, this is a cartoon. I'm going to assume
1754160	1758480	axi-symmetry. You have all kinds of interesting questions associated with how you break axi-symmetry.
1758480	1764480	We haven't addressed them. This is what I told you a minute or two ago that associated with
1764480	1771920	diurnal variations in temperature. You have heat and therefore air moving around. That means
1772000	1777760	pheromones are moving around. And the simplest rule for biology, for behavior, is you build if
1777760	1781600	the concentration of pheromones increases past the critical value, you stop and then you allow
1781600	1785760	things to degrade if the pheromone concentration does not. That's it. That's the only place
1785760	1790480	where I introduce a behavioral rule. Minimally, I have to therefore couple three different fields.
1791120	1798000	Temperature, which is the driving source of all that's happening. It's a function nominally of
1798000	1805920	time, but it becomes a function of space, s and z, z and s in the radial direction because I'm
1805920	1813040	thinking about a conducting porous material, a velocity which is driven by temperature variations
1813040	1816480	because of buoyancy and then pheromone concentration because they're essentially moved around. So
1816480	1821760	minimally, we have to have these three fields and forget the equations. I'll just describe what they
1821760	1825840	mean, which I think is very intuitive. Dienal oscillation would change in time with a frequency
1825840	1831920	which is one over 24 hours. Heat flow, so temperature variations are driven by advection
1831920	1836880	because of the fluid flow and they also have diffusion. Fluid flow, this is a porous medium,
1836880	1840640	it's driven essentially by temperature variations. Temperature variations lead to buoyancy and the
1840640	1844640	fluid is assumed to be incompressible. And the pheromone is advected by the fluid, it diffuses
1844640	1848480	and it has a source. And the source of all the pheromones are in the gallery because that's
1848480	1855440	where most of the termites are most of the time. Those are my equations. Here is the only place
1855440	1861120	where the biology quote comes in. You build, if the pheromone concentration becomes large,
1861120	1865200	then large in a critical value, you stop building or you essentially let it degrade and that's
1865200	1873520	coming in otherwise. That's it. What are the parameters? So there is a thickness of the wall,
1873520	1877440	which is where you have microporosity, after which you have this microporosity. There's a
1877440	1882080	thermal diffusion length, which is essentially associated with how much of the mound you can
1882160	1886800	heat or cool during the day or night. There is a buoyancy parameter, which is telling you
1886800	1891600	as a function of the temperature variations how fast or how slow is the fluid flow moving up and
1891600	1897600	down. And there is a pheromone penetration depth. And that is the idea that if I have a source of
1897600	1902720	pheromones and I just uniformly allow them to diffuse, there comes a critical distance beyond
1902720	1906400	which the concentration has fallen down below critical value. And if it's fallen down below
1906400	1910320	critical value, you won't build larger than that. And if there was no temperature variation,
1910960	1915760	or sorry, if there was no buoyancy, then this would be isotropic, so you get a spherical
1915760	1920480	termite mound. The reason that you get an elongated mound is precisely and only because
1921120	1926480	the termites are harnessing the buoyancy without even thinking about it, to have pheromones move
1926480	1931040	much faster in the vertical direction because of buoyancy and only slowly diffuse in the horizontal
1931040	1938160	direction. So you're assuming that the pheromones would produce their constant rate.
1938480	1943440	That anything beyond that will essentially make the problem more complicated. But yes,
1943440	1948000	in the simplest setting, I'm assuming that there is a source of pheromones that's uniform and at
1948000	1952000	one location. You can start making all kinds of complexities beyond that. Yes, indeed.
1952320	1954320	Yeah.
1961040	1962800	Which is known? Yes.
1972080	1978320	No, most over there, they're mostly excavating. All the building is happening above. So in the
1978320	1984160	gallery, there's a lot of porosity. Okay. Okay. So, but that's where the brood is,
1984160	1990080	and the brood are metabolically very active. So there's a huge source of pheromones and humidity,
1990080	1994080	water vapor, consequence of respiration, right there. But I don't know what was the...
1995280	1999440	There's a motion assumption here that I don't know. So you're assuming something about the
1999440	2004480	distribution of termites across the structure, and that's not... It's not here because I've
2004480	2009440	zoomed out and I'm thinking about not the individual dynamics of the termites. I'll come
2009440	2013840	back to that when I think about a second level of a model, which is more fine-grained. Here,
2013840	2017920	I'm saying I'm thinking about the termite mount as it's being built over an entire season.
2017920	2021600	So you're assuming that they're somehow uniformly spread over the structure?
2021600	2027680	I am assuming nothing about them except the fact that the order production is happening
2027680	2033360	at a particular location with a particular rate. Right. Okay. If the termites were actually moving
2033360	2037120	around and depositing it, if you hold on, I will show you a more fine-grained model,
2037120	2040640	which asks, what is the fine-grained structure? And I think part of the message,
2040640	2045760	perhaps, which I should have said, and maybe I'll say now, is I'm going to build a sequence of models,
2045760	2050400	actually in this case, two models. One for the coarse-grained perspective to understand
2050400	2054960	the aspect ratio and the size of the mount. Another one for the fine-grained structure,
2054960	2059680	because I'm going to show you with CAT scans that, in fact, the mount has a layered,
2059680	2064160	smectic-like behavior, smectic-like structure, you know, like a parking garage. And in order
2064160	2068720	to understand that, I'll have to start worrying about the dynamics of termites which are loaded
2068720	2073360	with cement, termites which are essentially unloaded and moving around, and how the air
2073360	2078000	is moving through all that I will build in at a more fine-grained level, if you will,
2078000	2083440	just wait for a couple of minutes. Question. More questions. Yeah.
2083440	2088720	So you said, you know, this still holds in the gallery. In the gallery, they're always active
2088720	2094080	because of the concentration of pheromones. In this case, I'm assuming that the gallery
2094080	2098160	is where most of the pheromones are produced. There could be pheromones produced elsewhere,
2098160	2103120	but I'm assuming that the concentration of pheromones elsewhere is a consequence of
2103120	2107600	being produced in large amounts at the base, and then moving around because of either diffusion
2107600	2112880	or buoyancy. I guess it's just for my mental picture. Is the gallery always increasing in size?
2112880	2120000	No, no, no. The gallery is first built, reaches a critical size. I don't know. We don't know what
2120000	2126000	the critical size is. And then, and only then, does the mound start to erupt outwards. Upwards,
2126000	2133440	sorry. Okay. So I've told you the parameters. There are three-dimensionalist parameters from
2133440	2139760	these four scales. There are two scaling laws, which I'm going to tell you about, which we can
2139760	2144160	calculate as consequences of these equations, but I could just directly read off once I know
2144160	2149280	what the parameters are. One is the aspect ratio. What is the height compared to the radius?
2149840	2154960	And the most important thing is its non-unity, and the reason it's non-unity is because of the
2154960	2159520	presence of this quantity, which I'm going to call a Peclet number. It's related to things
2159520	2163760	that have dynamics associated with how diffusion and advection play off against each other.
2163760	2167360	And what is this saying? This Peclet number is a ratio of this quantity
2168320	2173120	to this quantity, a pheromone penetration to buoyancy. So what is that really saying? That means
2173120	2177440	if the Peclet number is small, it's dominated by diffusion, therefore it's going to remain spherical.
2177440	2181280	If the Peclet number is large, that means the buoyancy length is large, which means you have
2181280	2185600	very, very large flows in the vertical direction, which means that the aspect ratio becomes very,
2185600	2190960	very large. Okay. And the reason it's a square, you must expect it should go at least as a square,
2190960	2194720	is because the symmetry doesn't matter which way it's going, whether it's up or down. So you could
2194720	2198320	have just guessed that, but in fact, you can calculate it and you can do the numerics solving
2198320	2204640	these PDEs and you find that that's correct. And there is another lens at timescale and the
2204640	2208160	timescale is associated with how long does it take to reach steady state. Why will it reach a
2208160	2212000	steady state? And this is a non-equilibrium steady state. It reaches a steady state because
2212000	2216000	eventually the pheromone concentration on the walls reaches phi star. And once it reaches
2216000	2220480	phi star, it can't grow anymore outwards. And similarly, once you reach steady velocity,
2220480	2225760	it can't grow to large in a critical height. And that characteristic time, not surprisingly,
2226800	2231360	is related to, I'm going to call this the BI, the BO number, which for all kinds of
2231360	2235680	historical reasons is named for the scientist BO, and it's characterized by this thermal diffusion
2235680	2243200	lens. So how much does that heat penetrate in or out of this? And you can calculate solutions,
2243840	2248640	which I'm going to show you when here are solutions of the PDEs, which show you different
2248640	2254800	kinds of mounds. And you can qualitatively, but only qualitatively see that they don't
2255760	2263440	have a complete discordance with observations. I mean, I can't say that they capture all of it,
2263440	2270160	but qualitatively they're correct. But question. Sorry, on that. So if the population were growing.
2270160	2276240	Very good. Yeah, ask the question. Well, that final inequality then would not be here.
2276320	2280560	Indeed. And if the populations are growing, termite mound will continuously grow. And so now,
2280560	2285200	and this is where you get a second mound, which starts to come up. Because what happens is there
2285200	2289120	are two possibilities. One is just you grow this individual mound, but then that means you're
2289600	2295200	depleting resources from the immediate neighborhood. You're depleting water, you're depleting fungus,
2295200	2299120	and so there is a characteristic scale beyond which it's no longer efficient to keep growing
2299120	2304240	this one mound. Instead, you'll find a second mound that grows. And in fact, I should say, so
2304240	2311120	we worked in Namibia for two seasons. And in India for three seasons. What we found is that
2311120	2316560	mounds will be built in a period of three to four months. In India, the monsoon essentially washes
2316560	2324640	out almost everything in Namibia. We found often that grazing animals use this as a backscratcher,
2324640	2329840	and they will destroy it. But in either case, rarely do you have a mound which will essentially
2329840	2333600	persist over, for example, we came back after a year, and most of the mounds we were studying were
2333600	2339040	gone. So there are much more sophisticated analysis associated with the timescale over
2339040	2342320	which you would expect this to stay. I don't really know. I don't have anything to say.
2343520	2349200	But I do want to now zoom in. You can see I hope these mounds, these are cross sections of mounds,
2349200	2354080	and you see the mounds are actually layered structures. And I want to now tell you a little
2354080	2365360	bit about them. So not the macromorphogenesis, but the macromorphogenesis zooming in. And here's
2365360	2370880	an image from our collaborator, Geethe Rallos, who studies collective behavior in Toulouse,
2372480	2376800	took one of the West African mounds. This is a much smaller one. Look at the size over here. These
2376800	2383520	are small of the order of something that you can hold in your hand. And you see this beautiful
2383600	2389360	smectic structure. In fact, if you, you know, like love these kind of ordered structures,
2390080	2393920	and familiar with liquid crystals, for example, where you have nematics, smectics,
2394560	2401360	smectics A, smectics C, and then you have cholesterics and all, and like a discoid liquid
2401360	2407600	crystals and polarized liquid crystals and whatnot, you know that you get defects,
2407600	2413120	edge dislocations, screw dislocations, so you see all these structures. But very importantly,
2413200	2418800	unlike in liquid crystals, where those are consequences of a very racial principle associated
2418800	2423280	with minimizing energy, here these are arising from non-equilibrium considerations. There's nothing
2423280	2428000	about the system, which is at equilibrium. And yet, because of the geometry, you are
2429040	2434640	inevitably going to be forced to have dislocations. And these dislocations, as I said, can take the
2434640	2440720	form of edge and screw dislocations. How do we understand these? Okay, same picture. I have to
2440720	2447920	couple the environment with the behavior, and with the airflow. In this case, I'm going to
2447920	2452000	think of now three fluids interacting with each other. As I said, the population of a termite
2452000	2456960	mound can be in the order of millions. I have two classes of termite mounds, mounds, termites,
2456960	2462640	which are loaded. So they have a bit of clay, particle of clay that they're moving around.
2463600	2468320	I have termite mounds which are unloaded. The mounds which are loaded are going to essentially
2468400	2473680	respond to gradients in pheromone and then drop the nest material at some particular location.
2473680	2481120	That changes the local porosity. That local porosity changes the dynamics of how the pheromone is
2481120	2485280	moving around in the presence or in the absence of airflow. That then changes the behavior of the
2485280	2488480	termite. And we have to essentially couple these exactly like what I was showing you before.
2489200	2494320	What Guy and his collaborators had shown a couple of years before, we started working on this
2494320	2499040	by looking at the behavior of individual termites in a Petri dish. So they weren't able to build
2499040	2505040	anything on the scale of a mound itself, but they were able to build small attempts that the
2505040	2509760	termites made to create these layered structures. And they found that the building rate is proportional
2509760	2513920	to first approximation of the pheromone concentration. And the removal rate is not
2513920	2518480	proportional. It's constant. So they essentially build more and more in response to higher and
2518480	2522080	higher concentrations. But then when they break it, they break it at a uniform rate.
2522240	2528320	And I'm going to use this in a model. And here is my model. And I'm sorry, it's a bit messy.
2529120	2534400	But let me explain what the physics is associated with each one of these equations. And these are
2534400	2538720	just essentially conservation laws and some reaction diffusion type equations. Let me explain
2538720	2545920	what. So the nest material, U is the nest material. When U varies from zero to one, it's either not
2545920	2553680	there at all or it's solid when it's one. Nest material is moved around in consequence of termites
2553680	2559440	which are loaded and destroyed because of termites which are essentially taking material away.
2559440	2564560	N plus and N minus are the populations of the termites which are loaded and unloaded.
2564560	2570960	And the nest, when it's being built, is assumed to be a soft porous solid. So it's like clay,
2570960	2575760	which will gradually settle down. And that's settling down. We build in through this term over
2575760	2582000	here. G is an effective gravity. It's essentially just loading the system. The fact that this is a
2582000	2587120	diffusion equation is consistent with the case. If I have a porous system which is just heavy
2587120	2590960	without any loading or unloading, without activity, it will start to sag. That's essentially why the
2590960	2596240	Leaning Tower of Pisa is leaning over large periods of time because of differences in the
2596240	2600720	foundation and the soil around it. It starts to essentially degrade. So that's the nest material.
2601040	2606160	The termite workers themselves are diffusing their chemo-tactic because they essentially
2606160	2612400	respond to gradients in the soil through chemo-tactic coefficient. And the termite workers themselves
2612400	2617840	can switch from being loaded to unloaded with a rate k. This diffusivity which is non-linear is
2617840	2622480	simply there because you can't have any diffusivity when u is equal to 1 since it's a solid. So it's
2622480	2626480	essentially completely gone. When u is equal to 1, it's a solid. Therefore, the termites can't move
2626480	2633440	at all. And finally, the pheromone concentration is diffusion. There is addition because of the
2633440	2639120	pheromones, because of the termites which are loaded. And there is a rate of degradation.
2639120	2643040	And the building and removal rates are very simple forms which essentially are proportional to the
2643040	2647520	loading of the loaded termites or the unloaded termites. And this u times 1 minus u is precisely
2647520	2653840	again so that it vanishes when you have no material and it also vanishes when there is only a solid.
2654480	2660720	So you can do a linear stability analysis and pull out the dimensionless parameters.
2660720	2665120	And the key dimensionless parameters that matter are the rate at which
2666720	2673840	diffusion and degradation arise in the pheromone concentration, a rate associated with the settling,
2673840	2680640	and the chemo-tactic coefficient. How strongly or how weakly do the termites respond to gradients
2680640	2689120	in pheromones? Here is an example of a simulation. I hope that you can see it. You get this layered
2689120	2695200	structure. The layer spacing is essentially, it shouldn't surprise you, anybody who's looked
2695200	2700160	at these reaction diffusion equations, you always get a spacing when you balance degradation with
2700160	2703600	diffusion. There's a characteristic length scale, which is this square root of those two. It turns
2703600	2708800	out for the values that we have in the system, this characteristic balance between diffusion and
2708800	2715520	degradation dominate and give you this spacing. No surprises that you also get edge dislocation
2715520	2719040	like structures and you also get screw dislocation like structures because you will never be able
2719040	2724000	to build perfectly when you're trying to essentially get layers. The only last point which I want to
2724000	2728560	make is what sets the orientation of the layers and the orientation of the layers is set by
2728560	2732640	gravity. It's essentially right there because otherwise you could say, oh, why should it be
2733440	2736800	layered this way? Why can't it be layered this way? Or why can't it be layered that way? And that's
2736800	2742320	because the settling is happening in one direction. So gravity in a very humble but profound, I would
2742320	2748560	say, way dominates both the physics of the large scale buoyancy driven circulation and on this
2748560	2756720	small scale setting the polarization of the layer orientation as well. Okay, that's my second
2756960	2768080	story about mound micro morphogenesis and I hope that it's clear no plan, no planner, there isn't
2768080	2773040	even a representation of the task. Okay, we think about intelligence requiring representation,
2773040	2780240	there is no representation anywhere. There is all that's happening is local sensing and local
2780240	2786240	action and out of that you can essentially get these structures and I want to emphasize
2786320	2790400	these are also out of equilibrium. They are not solutions of any variation problems even though
2790400	2796640	they look like they may have a variational way of getting there, for example, in the crystals.
2796640	2801280	So therefore they're both repairable and they're also adaptable. They're repairable because if I
2801280	2806080	monkey around with what happens at one location, immediately these dynamics will essentially change
2806080	2810800	the way in the pheromone moves around and therefore it will repair itself and it's also adaptable
2810800	2814640	for the same reason because if the temperature variations are present, then you will essentially
2814640	2820080	upscale or downscale the pattern. I'm just wondering what limits the size of the pheromone
2820080	2828800	and also the size of the population. So the size I believe is associated with the population,
2828800	2834000	it's scaled with the population. Now you're asking what sets the population and I don't
2834000	2840240	know the answer. I do know that what has been seen and that's primarily in these three
2840800	2849200	mounds, so they're not really mounds, they're much smaller nests. You will see characteristic
2849200	2855680	population and term and mound size correlate very well. In the context of mounds on the ground,
2856400	2859760	you have to have ground penetrating radar or something of that sort to be able to first
2859760	2864160	know where to even look and then start asking the question. I don't really have a whole lot to say.
2864800	2871840	Context of how long do they persist? I think the question that you're asking is a question of
2871840	2878640	is it more efficient to repair a mound or as it ages and it's physical aging or is it better
2878640	2885440	to start a new mound and so that's I think now much harder question to understand in the absence
2885440	2891040	of any data. I mean you can make up a story that past some age it just becomes very hard to continuously
2891040	2895840	repair the mounds and then you start making another one but that's my stories as good as yours.
2896880	2903280	Okay all right so I have 10 minutes or less? Okay so I want to switch maybe I'll just give
2903280	2908640	you a brief view. I think you must have heard some of it from Orit. I'll give you...
2909520	2916480	Do you know any of the communication industry of this and strategies? I mean all that term
2916480	2923600	might sort of crap at building mounds or is there any comparative data that gives you a feeling for that?
2928160	2933600	There probably is. I am not able to recall having quantitative data. I can tell you about
2933600	2937840	quantitative data from an evolutionary point of view associated with the fact that because we've
2937840	2943920	studied three different species in three different continents you know the size of the mound, the
2943920	2951360	shape of the mound we can qualitatively understand using these scaling laws. Temperature variations
2951360	2956480	becoming larger, the mound becomes larger, populations becoming larger, the mound becoming
2956480	2960480	larger. If you're now asking me can you predict the exponents? I mean we can but can you essentially
2960480	2970800	verify anything? No, zero. I mean these experiments, yeah, no. So the only part of the history is we've
2970800	2975120	studied three different species in three different continents. They're all conforming with the model.
2976400	2978880	They are qualitatively consistent.
2982240	2988560	You know I have another life where we actually study just the physics of things where I think we can
2988560	2995040	be a lot more hard-nosed about exponents and phase diagrams and so on and if I try to compare it with
2995040	3001360	that part we are very far away unfortunately. So this is all qualitative at this point,
3001360	3009280	unfortunately. Okay, all right. In the next 10 minutes I want to first give you a view of the
3009280	3012640	kinds of problems we've studied with bees but I won't tell you about any of them and then I'll
3012640	3018400	switch to ants if I have a little bit of time but I'm also happy to stop after. It's okay. So this is
3018560	3027040	a bee beard if you like in the Concord Field Station and you know on a day like this actually
3027040	3034960	at a time like this but probably about seven years ago or so, eight years ago and so you know this
3034960	3043440	cluster of bees is hanging by essentially holding on to its neighbors. Okay and why is it doing this?
3043440	3048960	So probably the most famous thing that everybody knows about in the context of collective behavior
3048960	3054000	of bees is associated with the waggle dance. Okay so when the bees essentially have to make a
3054000	3062240	decision about creating or moving to a new home then there's this remarkable set of events. First
3062240	3069760	I think described by Carl von Frisch in the 1930s and 40s for which as I said he and Thinbergen
3069760	3076720	and Conrad Lorenz shared Nobel Prize in 1967 and 68 where the bees essentially signal to each other
3076720	3084480	by waggling their bodies, changing their orientation and having more or less vigor associated with a
3086480	3090960	location. Once that decision has been made the bees have to move from one location to the other
3090960	3096000	and they typically move in over a period of days so they don't have the capacity to do this in one
3096000	3102080	day and if they do this as it will typically happen at this time of the year early spring then
3102080	3106480	there's a potential problem which is that they may freeze at night and to prevent freezing at night
3106480	3110480	they essentially have to create a bivouac for the night for maybe two nights maybe three nights
3110480	3114720	and this is the kind of bivouac that they treat where where they create where they essentially
3114720	3120400	hold on to each other so this is a potential solution to two problems one you need to be
3120400	3125360	mechanically stable so you have to hold on to the branch not at one point but over some finite
3125360	3131360	length of the branch or the bow and another is to essentially minimize the amount of surface to
3131360	3136880	reduce the amount of loss heat loss and there's very nice questions not just associated with
3136880	3142800	how they form these structures but even the structure of the structure itself which means
3142800	3146400	what which means what type of bees are on the outside and what type of bees on the inside
3146400	3150880	for example we know due to the work of Bernd Heinrich from the 1970s that in fact the younger
3150880	3154640	bees are on the inside the older bees on the outside not only that the bees on the outside
3154640	3161200	have pneumatic order okay so a very beautiful set of questions associated with trying to minimize
3161200	3167200	the thermal shock and the mechanical shock so a few years ago with Jake Peters and Ulpela we studied
3167200	3174720	this and I want to show you an experiment where Jake did and I won't tell you what the theory
3174720	3180560	which was done a few years ago so here's an experiment Jake basically took a piece of wood
3181440	3186480	created a little cage to which he attached which he attached to the piece of wood and within which
3187120	3192960	he also had a queen and then the bees essentially aggregated around that and he put this whole
3192960	3197600	thing inside a box and changed the temperature so you want to essentially understand how does this
3197600	3202160	cluster respond to temperature variations okay let me show you
3202400	3214400	the temperature is cycling from between 15 degrees 14 degrees or so the bees will go into a chill
3214400	3220960	coma and it's changing over a period of a few hours and what you see is essentially a porous
3220960	3227280	medium which is capable of responding by becoming more porous or less porous it becomes more porous
3227280	3232400	as it heats up and becomes less porous as it cools down what does that mean that means that
3232400	3236080	it becomes hotter and hotter you essentially create change the porosity and by changing the porosity
3236080	3240640	you can essentially get airflow and by changing the airflow you can get dynamics and cooling and
3240640	3247040	then when it cold when it becomes cold it shrinks and you know we understand we teach students how
3247040	3252160	to do calculations of heat conduction temperature variations and so on in the context of a first
3252160	3258560	course in thermodynamics and this is very cool because it's functional and it's active so what
3258560	3263920	are the bees doing so they're essentially spreading themselves out or moving their legs out or moving
3263920	3268480	their legs in and one can make some sense out of this so this is an example of if you want
3268480	3273280	where temperature regulation is associated with changing the physicality the embodiment of how
3273280	3277600	the collective essentially responds we're seeing the porosity is like the area
3277680	3283360	that's the simplest measure or it has now gone on I think I've actually measured in fact using an
3283360	3288640	x she's put the whole hive into a tomograph and she can essentially watch what is inside right
3288640	3292080	now you can just see it's the same number of bees how do we know that we can measure the weight
3292080	3296000	before and after and we can see that the same number of bees the volume is much larger therefore
3296000	3301120	the porosity has increased and the density has decreased and therefore in the surface area right
3301120	3304400	there has to be naturally a change in the surface area but the total number of bees kept is kept
3304400	3310560	constant yeah okay there's mechanical adaptation so as I said you have to change you have to
3310560	3314160	figure out how to maintain temperature you have to also figure out how to essentially respond
3314160	3319440	to shocks mechanical shocks so if I put you inside an elevator and I start shaking you what would you
3319440	3324560	do I mean I've shown you the result over there but what would you do individually okay move to
3324560	3329120	the ground so that you can basically move and have your center of mass as low as possible or go to a
3329120	3335280	wall this happens collectively as well okay so when I start shaking the cluster of bees they
3335280	3342720	start spreading out okay so this is very interesting because this is a kind of mechanical if you want
3344080	3349760	way of distributing the load because if the bees at the base have to take up all the load the bees
3349760	3354160	at the tip don't have to take up any of the load at all and yet they do so so is this a mechanical
3354240	3360320	altruism I don't know okay because all that's happening move all the bees to the to the surface
3360320	3367760	and therefore the load on all of them reduces and they're much happier okay so you can you can make
3367760	3372240	sense of this again using a theoretical model which I'm pretty sure Orit has talked to you about
3373200	3379360	but fundamentally it's playing with a collective version of a set of pendula which can essentially
3379360	3384240	oscillate from side to side we can also oscillate up and down so you have two degrees of freedom
3384240	3388880	you have a whole collection of them and you can show that functionally load distribution is much
3388880	3395680	much better and much more robust when you flatten out at high amplitudes or high frequencies and
3395680	3401440	then there is a third problem so this is mechanical thermal regulation that's mechanical adaptation
3401440	3406720	and and and then there is the hydrodynamics of ventilation so in the termite mound the mound
3407600	3410960	is more or less fixed and the whole mound works as a lung
3412080	3419040	in the bee box the bees can't question yeah what would be the trade-off between shaking
3419040	3426640	very good between these two yeah I don't have an answer what we do find is that you can see
3427760	3434000	over here the yeah why don't we can you ask me the question at the end I'll come back to that
3434000	3439040	because it's a very difficult question associated with you know if I want to be mechanically stable
3439040	3444240	and thermally relatively well insulated what kinds of shapes do you get I mean we have some thoughts
3444240	3450000	on that but just can you hold on and ask me the question at the end okay so I want to contrast
3450000	3456000	ventilation in the termite mound where the mound is fixed and temperature variations as a function
3456000	3462400	of time are converted to spatial gradients which lead to flows in a bee box the bee box is fixed
3462400	3469360	and a remarkable solution seems to present itself um on the solution so this is the bee box right
3469360	3473360	here this is where the brood is now let me show you
3479600	3485040	at the entrance fan okay question for you which way should you fan
3485360	3492640	and where first which way and then where outwards or inwards
3501040	3503040	why
3506640	3513600	not only to remove the question or comment you say inwards good okay turns out that
3513600	3518080	you want to actually pull air you want to you want to get outwards why because I can measure
3518080	3522400	not only can I essentially ventilate but I can measure I can measure what is happening inside
3522400	3527600	the hive or inside the bee box by pulling material by pulling the air out and now there are two
3527600	3534800	solutions okay if I can pull air out I can do this by modulating in time that's how we do when we breathe
3536160	3541520	same entrance and same exit we modulate in time okay I don't have to modulate in time alone I can
3541520	3548560	modulate in space so it depends on the size of the orifice if I had a very wide mouth I can say
3548560	3553120	at one part I essentially pull in and if I pull in at one part I can continuously pull in and the
3553120	3558480	other part just by continuity you just move out and that's the second solution that we find so
3558480	3563920	they always pull out and then they will spontaneously when they start out originally being homogeneous
3563920	3568560	distributed they will end up on one boundary or the other so there's a transition there's an instability
3568640	3572480	and that essentially drives the transition all the bees which are pulling out end up on one side
3572480	3576880	and then they can continuously pull out and the advantage is when I'm measuring and I am
3576880	3582480	ventilating now if I need more bees I just have to signal and so bees have a nason off gland they
3582480	3587680	have essentially a whole set of pheromones associated with signaling so they push that signal out and
3587680	3592560	the same wind which is essentially associated with pulling the air out now you can essentially
3592560	3597600	advect you've probably all heard of stigmergy and in the context of stigmergy using diffusion
3597600	3601440	to essentially signal now using flow which of course that means you're essentially improving
3601440	3605120	the efficiency enormously because instead of square root of time it's going linearly as time
3605120	3610400	and this is what bees do so they will first start pulling out then they will essentially end up on
3610400	3615120	one side and then finally they will essentially get other bees to join using this nason off
3615120	3619280	sensing mechanism and you can construct a mathematical framework for this you can do
3619280	3626640	experiments and so on okay I think I have run out of time so I am happy to stop here for anybody
3628240	3632720	and same thing in every one of these problems in the termite case in the all the bee cases
3632720	3638000	there was local sensing there's local actuation here it's heat transport here with mechanical
3638000	3644000	vibrations here it's fluid flow and heat transport and carbon dioxide all of these things
3644640	3650080	embodied or available to you I wouldn't even say embodied local sensing and actuation is
3650080	3656880	embodied the rest is there and and it's used repeatedly by these organisms so I will stop
3658880	3666000	by going to the last slide I had I think three slides four slides I'm going to go to the last slide
3666640	3675280	and happy to talk to people about ants if you want to stay I showed you some examples of how
3676160	3682800	large-scale problem solving can happen very very simply using local sensing and actuation
3682800	3688480	and critically it's mediated by physical fields which you cannot ignore because all this happened
3688480	3695920	in the world it didn't happen in some abstract brain or with a set of circuits alone second
3696000	3701520	thing this idea that you can separately study you know the living and non-living perhaps but
3701520	3709520	certainly in these social systems and super organisms I don't think so and I want to bring
3709520	3715440	to mind I think somebody who I'm sure is a great inspiration for people here as as as he has been
3715440	3722320	for me which is associated with the parable of the ant I think Herb Simon famously showed
3723120	3728800	an image of an ant showing some very very complicated path and without showing the
3728800	3732480	environment at all and the point that he wanted to make is that it looks like a very complicated
3732480	3735280	path because you've forgotten what the environment and as soon as you put the environment in
3735840	3739440	everything starts to essentially make itself much more clear and so rather than thinking
3739440	3745200	only about embodiment should we be extending it in order to account for the environment as well
3745200	3754080	well I showed you these examples Stigmergy's diffusive signaling flow is advective vibrations
3754080	3761120	is non-local just like flow I want to emphasize what I said before you can have what you might
3761120	3766880	think of as adaptable learnable solutions but you don't need representation you don't need plan
3766880	3772480	you don't need planner and you automatically get robustness because you've distributed a lot of
3772480	3778480	everything that you want to do into very simple local rules okay last point I want to come back
3778480	3783200	to where I started unfortunately I didn't have a chance to tell you about this but I am happy
3783200	3789040	to talk to people privately we've really started now asking questions of how hard or how easy it
3789040	3794800	is to do this from a synthetic perspective and not synthetic biology but if you want synthetic
3794800	3801200	engineering mathematical models of course are a way to synthesize systems but also physical
3801200	3807600	mimics and I'll close with a question which I think inspired a lot of people over here and
3807600	3812720	continues to inspire me you know just like Curing was thinking about intelligence can we think
3812720	3819280	about behavior the same way how much of what is happening can I essentially understand by
3819280	3826400	looking at collective behavior and if we can't then I think this quest of pushing towards ever
3826400	3832960	smaller mechanistic understanding of the molecular scale may be a lost cause you can only say what
3832960	3838960	is minimally needed you can perhaps say what is sufficient but beyond that it's very very hard to
3838960	3843600	say exactly all the different things all the different ways in which you can essentially come
3843600	3848560	up with a solution and that's of course not at all surprising because inverse problems are notoriously
3848560	3854320	ill-posed unless I have regularization unless I have mathematically or physically ways of
3854320	3859200	essentially saying these are the classes of solutions that I'm able to deal with I can't
3859200	3864240	really answer that question how do I deduce the rules by looking at the behavior for example if I'd
3864240	3869440	shown you you know these robots as individual particles could you tell me whether they were
3869440	3874960	actual robots whether they were termites and if you can't I think there's a real issue with asking
3874960	3879600	that kind of a question okay on that I will stop thank you so much I'm sorry I went over
3880400	3882240	gotta get out of here
3892240	3898320	so it's interesting this
3898320	3902560	What's in it, dude, is what's in it.
3902560	3905280	So, physics for you is embodiment.
3905280	3910280	So, right, so the non-local large space scales,
3910520	3912940	net scales are coming from physics.
3912940	3917040	And whereas us, we get it from the whole body.
3917040	3918640	We don't need the physics to do the work.
3918640	3919480	Our body does the work.
3919480	3920440	I'm just wondering.
3920440	3923240	I would say that even for us, the environment is critical.
3923240	3924760	Well, I'm not saying it's not critical,
3925280	3930280	but in this narrative, if you're that tiny termite,
3932680	3935000	the only way you get this on non-local information
3935000	3936360	is from the physics, right?
3936360	3937720	From these circulations.
3937720	3940560	Whereas we can get it from long axons.
3940560	3942920	I don't need physics to do the work.
3942920	3944160	Well, I would say the long axons
3944160	3945920	are probably one of the physical solutions.
3945920	3947200	But anyway, but keep going.
3947200	3949600	Well, if that was, then you'd be inconsistent
3949600	3951120	in the way your narrative works
3951120	3955800	because that's a part of the organism, right?
3955800	3958200	You could say nerve conduction is physics or something,
3958200	3960920	but not useful conception physics seems to me.
3960920	3962840	But I'm just wondering whether or not
3962840	3964320	there are sort of two worlds.
3964320	3966360	There's the world of little things.
3966360	3969040	And the only way they can build large structures
3970000	3973360	is by obtaining these non-local information
3973360	3975000	from physical principles.
3975000	3977800	And there's an activity to go to us
3977800	3980520	where you just build large-scale biological structure,
3980520	3983400	which does the work, and physics becomes auxiliary.
3988360	3993360	Let me, first of all, say that even for,
3994280	3996560	so for us, are you saying that
3996560	3998440	if I wanted to build something large,
3998440	4000280	I cannot do it using physics?
4000280	4002520	I cannot, but there are these two very different ways
4002520	4003640	of doing it.
4003640	4008640	Yeah, so let me frame this from an evolutionary point of view.
4008840	4010880	So these organisms have been around
4010880	4014480	for 100 times longer than us,
4014480	4016260	for 350 million years.
4018680	4023680	With relatively simple, I think, compared to us,
4023680	4025240	in going along exactly the direction
4025240	4027260	that you're going, cognitive rules,
4027260	4032260	and yet capable of solving these physiological tasks
4032400	4035720	which are common across the entire animal kingdom.
4035720	4037720	If I have societies, I have to worry
4037720	4041080	about large-scale respiration, large-scale physiology,
4041080	4044000	locomotion, predation, pre-capture, and so on.
4047040	4049800	In early evolution, this is a solution that came to be.
4053760	4057400	As evolution moved on, and this is a question
4057400	4058600	to which I don't really have an answer
4058600	4060040	in the sense that I'm satisfied with.
4060040	4061440	I mean, there are a lot of words,
4061440	4062440	but I don't know how to convert that
4062440	4064600	into anything more quantitative.
4065600	4068880	Can you have a notion of assimilation?
4068880	4072560	That is to say, you take these physics-based rules
4072560	4074040	which are part of the environment,
4074040	4076600	and then you build them into the body.
4076600	4077640	When I build them into the body,
4077640	4081640	I have the ability to move by essentially coordination.
4081640	4085400	That was previously, this bee talked to that bee,
4085400	4087360	which talked to that bee, and they all moved together.
4087360	4089840	But now I say, no, let me just make a super bee,
4089840	4091000	and I connect them all together.
4091000	4093640	Now they become part of the organism, super organism.
4095600	4098080	So I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying.
4098080	4102400	I don't see a temporal path which tells you how to start here,
4102400	4104400	because these have been around, as I said,
4104400	4108240	for a hundred times longer than us.
4109240	4110360	They're multicellular.
4110360	4112400	They solve, by the way, the same kind of problems
4112400	4114160	that we solve on the organismal level.
4114160	4116520	I didn't talk about the physiology of respiration.
4116520	4119800	In insect respiration, it's very different from our respiration.
4119800	4121440	Small insects don't need lungs.
4121440	4123240	They don't need lungs because they can essentially
4123560	4126000	interact directly with the environment through spiracles,
4126000	4128160	which means diffusive transport is good enough.
4128160	4130520	You become big, you have to change your rules.
4130520	4133560	So I'm not disagreeing at all with you.
4133560	4138160	I guess my concern is, is it really a discrete setting,
4138160	4142440	because I sort of think of this as a whole spectrum of solutions?
4142440	4145960	Let's imagine, if the termite might now and now say,
4145960	4148880	right, and you just stomp the bout
4148880	4151280	and move around in the environment, right?
4151320	4153640	At that point, these principles are kind of useless,
4153640	4156080	because that degree of integration is not going to be achieved
4156080	4158480	by advection and diffusion anymore.
4158480	4160520	That's why we have neuron, long neurons, right?
4160520	4163240	So in other words, there really is a distinction
4163240	4167400	that comes in once you have these more structured interactions.
4167400	4171120	So I would say that transition is not as discrete
4171120	4173680	as I think what I'm hearing you say.
4173680	4175920	This is a distributed solution.
4175920	4177800	If I don't know whether you're saying
4177800	4180080	that you also have possibilities for centralized solutions,
4180120	4181920	centralized brains, if you're not saying that,
4181920	4182840	then I think we don't disagree.
4182840	4185200	But if you are, then I would say I'm not sure that I agree.
4185200	4188000	Oh, it's not central, but...
4188000	4191040	Because you can think about cephalopods, yeah.
4191040	4193320	Central, I'm not using that central.
4193320	4195000	Just this idea that, anyway,
4195000	4198760	but this idea that advection and diffusion,
4198760	4202840	we don't have a nervous system that does its work.
4202840	4205280	I don't do vision by advection and diffusion.
4205280	4206560	Oh, I didn't talk only about advection and diffusion.
4206560	4208320	I talked about there are all kinds of other things
4208360	4209680	that are mechanical, there's movement,
4209680	4210920	there's all kinds of other things as well.
4210920	4212720	I mean, I gave you a couple of examples
4212720	4213880	where you can have active movement,
4213880	4216480	which can essentially solve problems in morphogenesis.
4218360	4220760	And if you ask me questions about vision,
4220760	4222720	I mean, understanding how the orientation
4222720	4224080	dominance columns arise,
4224080	4226320	actually it is advection and diffusion
4226320	4228120	coupled with stimuli,
4228120	4231400	which lead to ocular dominance columns arising.
4232480	4233560	We can have...
4233560	4237480	Dominance columns arrive through a strict connectivity
4237520	4240440	of neurons through reciprocal advection.
4240440	4242520	That's how ocular dominance columns arrive.
4242520	4244560	There is an underlying connectivity that gives...
4244560	4246080	Yeah, but how do you get the connectivity in the first place?
4246080	4246920	No, it's fair enough.
4246920	4247760	That's different.
4247760	4248840	I mean, no, but that's part of...
4248840	4250720	You can't put the connectivity in.
4250720	4252320	You've got to get the connectivity out.
4257560	4259320	We should continue to see that.
4259320	4260600	Yeah, yeah.
4260600	4261600	Okay, thank you.
