WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
at Cambridge University and he's been a professor of physics at Harvard University for the past

00:05.280 --> 00:12.240
20 plus years I guess. Two facts about him that you might not know or maybe you do know is one

00:12.240 --> 00:18.320
of MacArthur, genius of course, 1009. And the other thing is that he's also recipient of the

00:18.320 --> 00:30.960
Ike Bilbell Prize in 2007 and what he wanted for was understanding wrinkly of sheets and manifolds

00:30.960 --> 00:36.720
when they land on surfaces so every time I look in the mirror I'll keep the view.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.680
That's pretty cool. I hope everybody else does the same from now on. Okay, thank you Sid.

00:42.480 --> 00:49.360
It's a very small group so I hope that you will make this more of a multi-log and just

00:49.360 --> 00:57.920
interrupt me as you feel the need to and correct me which I'm sure you will. So I wanted to tell

00:57.920 --> 01:04.640
you something about some problems that I've been working on for more than a decade. All inspired

01:04.640 --> 01:14.400
by originally Edward Lear and the wonderful poetry that he wrote in the 19th century associated

01:14.400 --> 01:21.200
with collective nouns for groups of animals. So I'm going to show you one and I'm going to ask

01:21.200 --> 01:30.080
you a question. So these are starlings from a BBC documentary above Rome so probably everybody

01:30.080 --> 01:36.320
over here does know what the collective noun for starlings is. Memorization. What is it for rhinos?

01:40.320 --> 01:49.680
A crash. What is it for owls? Parliament. Yeah, so I think what is it for?

01:50.480 --> 02:01.600
I'm going to say, well, no, I'm not going to go, never mind. So the point about these

02:01.600 --> 02:06.160
collectives is that it says something about function and that's very important and that's

02:06.160 --> 02:12.400
what I want to try and emphasize over the next hour or so that even though from the

02:12.400 --> 02:19.280
perspective that certainly I'm going to tell you a little bit about from physics, from mathematics,

02:19.280 --> 02:26.160
you can ask about what kinds of and what forms of order do you see in collectives of organisms

02:26.160 --> 02:35.600
on any scale from microbes to robots. But as the language, as English actually has got so many,

02:35.600 --> 02:39.840
and I'm sure this is true of every language, has got so many different forms for collectives

02:39.840 --> 02:44.960
different depending on the organism, it's associated with function. So why do these

02:44.960 --> 02:49.280
collectives exist? Presumably they're associated with every collective there's a function. And

02:49.280 --> 02:52.160
also from a physics point of view, you can ask a mathematics point of view, you can ask how do

02:52.160 --> 02:56.080
they form. So there are three kinds of questions that you can ask about any kinds of collective

02:56.080 --> 03:04.000
behavior in particular associated with collections of animals. And what I'd like to do is to ask

03:04.000 --> 03:08.800
two different types of questions associated with collective behavior. One is how is collective

03:08.800 --> 03:15.920
behavior constrained by physics. And the other is how does physics enable function in the context

03:15.920 --> 03:21.760
of collective behavior. And I think it's interesting to point out a framework for this which has been

03:21.760 --> 03:28.640
laid out a long time ago outside of physics by Nicholas Tinbergen, one of two brothers, both

03:28.640 --> 03:36.720
of whom got the Nobel Prize. Tinbergen got the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine and he shared

03:36.800 --> 03:44.800
it with Conrad Lorenz and Frisch in 1967 and 1968. And he raised a set of questions which have formed

03:44.800 --> 03:52.080
the bedrock of ethology in studying behavior in animals. He was originally thinking about single

03:52.080 --> 03:56.320
animals, individuals, but we can ask the same question in the context of collective. So he asked,

03:56.320 --> 04:01.760
you know, what is a behavior in terms of its function? So, you know, how can you describe

04:01.840 --> 04:08.640
that function? Why does that function arise? How does that function come to be in the context

04:08.640 --> 04:13.680
of causation? And then both a proximal and a distal perspective in an organism, how does that

04:14.640 --> 04:20.400
behavior develop? And how does it essentially arise across different species in an evolutionary

04:20.400 --> 04:24.080
setting? But you don't have to limit yourself to organisms. You can of course ask the same

04:24.080 --> 04:28.800
question in the context of collections of organisms. And what I want to do is to make this

04:28.800 --> 04:32.000
very specific because I'm thinking about function in the context of architectures

04:33.200 --> 04:37.040
because they are very concrete, quite literally often in, for example, with the human

04:38.480 --> 04:44.000
situation. But in the animal situation, you also have remarkable sets of architectures which are

04:44.000 --> 04:50.880
formed from the scale of microbes. We can essentially create biofilms to ants, to bees. I'm going to

04:50.880 --> 04:55.760
focus on social insects, to termites. And I've shown you three different scales. Each one of them

04:55.760 --> 05:02.720
has organisms on the scale of hundreds, two thousands or even millions. In this case associated

05:02.720 --> 05:07.360
with maximizing transport from one location on a tree to another. In this case, which I'll come

05:07.360 --> 05:13.920
back to associated with understanding how to minimize heating and cooling conditions within

05:13.920 --> 05:19.680
the inside and or mechanically being stable when responding to a wind. And in this case,

05:19.680 --> 05:24.960
a combination of making sure that you are simultaneously not fully insulated from the

05:25.040 --> 05:29.360
environment, but not fully porous to the environment so that the vagaries and the fluctuations

05:29.360 --> 05:32.480
associated with the environment can be buffered to some extent by architectures.

05:34.240 --> 05:39.840
So these functional collectives in general, lots of work has been gone on from a biological

05:39.840 --> 05:46.640
perspective, tend to roughly be capable of being broken up into ways of controlling how

05:47.520 --> 05:52.320
in a physical context, energy matter information can be transferred with an uncertain environment.

05:52.320 --> 05:58.480
And that environment and the ways in which the collectives form are or have to be adaptable in

05:58.480 --> 06:02.240
a way which I'll become, which has become clearer and also are spatially heterogeneous. So they're

06:02.240 --> 06:09.760
not just temporal, but also complex spatial patterns that form. And moving away from our

06:09.760 --> 06:14.000
perspective and thinking about energy matter information, if I'm thinking about these systems

06:14.000 --> 06:19.200
in a biological context, we have to start thinking about how you can or not get coordination and

06:19.200 --> 06:23.760
communication in the context of these functional self-organized patterns. And an important thing

06:23.760 --> 06:27.360
that I think I don't have to convince anybody over here, but worth pointing out right at the

06:27.360 --> 06:32.400
beginning is in none of these cases, is there any evidence of a plan or a planner? There is

06:33.840 --> 06:37.440
some sensing, there is some action at the individual level, which gradually

06:38.160 --> 06:42.000
transcends the individual and at the collective level leads to these functional patterns.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.200
And the most important part is that you can't leave out the environment. And that's what I'm

06:47.200 --> 06:50.320
going to talk about in three different examples. So you have to think about the organism, you've

06:50.320 --> 06:55.680
got to think about the organism interacting with other conspecifics, and then eventually you've

06:55.680 --> 06:59.280
got to think about how it interacts with the environment. It changes the environment and

06:59.280 --> 07:03.040
is changed by the environment. And you have to see these three examples, we immediately see that,

07:03.040 --> 07:08.640
to understand that. Okay, so as I said, typical kind of question that we can ask is both ways,

07:08.640 --> 07:14.720
how does collective behavior enabled and how does collective behavior constrained by physics?

07:15.680 --> 07:18.320
Okay, I want to talk about social insects

07:20.400 --> 07:25.280
for a reason which I don't think again is necessary for me to elaborate too much,

07:26.080 --> 07:31.920
primarily because you have a remarkable, so these are the big four classes of social insects,

07:31.920 --> 07:36.480
these wasps, ants, and termites. But from the point of view of the perspective that I came

07:36.480 --> 07:39.840
to this from, I started out thinking about morphogenesis and thinking about multicellular

07:39.840 --> 07:43.760
organisms. And there are lots of parallels between multicellular organisms and super

07:43.760 --> 07:50.400
organisms, where these super organisms have a separation between the germline and the soma,

07:50.400 --> 07:55.280
just like in multicellular organisms as well. Here you have often usually a queen,

07:55.280 --> 08:00.800
and that's the only organism in colony that's capable of reproductive behavior. But then

08:00.800 --> 08:09.440
everything else is shared, you have common nests, they are unlike in us, social insects are clonal,

08:09.440 --> 08:12.960
you have reproductive mission of labor, as I said before, you have cooperative brood care,

08:12.960 --> 08:16.320
you have overlapping generations, and the consequence of the last two is that you have

08:16.320 --> 08:20.240
a sense of culture, and that culture is transmitted not through genetics, but through other means.

08:21.600 --> 08:27.840
Okay, as a consequence of having these very large collections of organisms, you find that

08:27.840 --> 08:32.160
they are extraordinary problem solvers. They can solve problems in physiology that are impossible

08:32.160 --> 08:36.640
to solve on the scale of an individual organism, but can be solved collectively on the scale of

08:36.640 --> 08:43.360
hundreds to millions of organisms. And as I said, I want to tell you about architectures,

08:44.240 --> 08:48.000
and architectures are wonderful because you can essentially figure out a way to connect physiology

08:48.000 --> 08:52.160
to physics, in this case the physiology is the architecture which is living, but not necessarily

08:52.160 --> 08:55.920
made only of living things. It's essentially the environment which is dynamically changing,

08:55.920 --> 09:00.480
and I'm going to show you examples of how these architectures allow for respiration and ventilation

09:00.480 --> 09:04.720
on scales much larger than organisms in the context of bees, thermoregulation also in the

09:04.720 --> 09:08.400
context of bees, and mechanoregulation in the context of termites and bees.

09:11.920 --> 09:16.560
I've said this before, I want to emphasize this again. We should be thinking about the fact that

09:16.560 --> 09:20.720
in all these examples that I'll tell you about, the environment is a malleable substrate, so it

09:20.720 --> 09:26.240
can be changed by the organism, and a consequence of that is it changes the behavior of the organism,

09:26.240 --> 09:31.680
and so the environment serves as a slow communication channel. The dynamics of the

09:31.680 --> 09:34.640
environment is slow, typically compared to the dynamics of the organism,

09:36.320 --> 09:40.240
modulo being close to where we are in the context of climate change and tipping points and what

09:40.240 --> 09:44.560
not, but in general you have a separation of timescales associated with these things.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.480
Okay, so the three examples that I want to tell you about which involve

09:48.480 --> 09:52.720
connecting experiment and theory in very different places, and very different times over the last

09:52.720 --> 09:58.880
decade. First example that I want to tell you about is associated with termite mounds. This

09:58.880 --> 10:03.920
is an image of a termite mound from here, from Bangalore. We started out doing experiments over

10:03.920 --> 10:11.200
here and then in Namibia and then parts of Western Africa. This is an image of a termite mound during

10:11.200 --> 10:18.560
the day. This is an image of the termite mound at night viewed through an infrared camera superposed

10:18.560 --> 10:24.880
on a regular image, and what you can see is essentially changes in temperature, so this

10:24.880 --> 10:30.160
part is at night warm and cold, depending on time of the day or time of the night. Now I'll

10:30.160 --> 10:34.880
come back to this, and this is work that was done with Sam Oko, who was a PhD student, and Alex

10:34.880 --> 10:38.240
Hyde, also a PhD student, and I'll come back to that. So what are the questions over here? The

10:38.240 --> 10:45.360
questions are what is the structure for, how is it built, and how does this all work out in the

10:45.360 --> 10:49.200
context of a larger ecological question of the environment? This is a termite mound.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.320
Oh, what? I'm going to show you all this. I'm going to tell you about the anatomy,

10:54.320 --> 10:58.160
I'm going to tell you about the physiology, so hold the question. And please do stop me

10:58.160 --> 11:01.440
with questions at any point. Some of them I will answer immediately, but some,

11:01.440 --> 11:04.480
if you don't mind, I'll wait because I will have something to say about that.

11:04.480 --> 11:10.080
The second problem that I want to tell you about was done in collaboration with Orif Pelleg, who I

11:10.080 --> 11:15.040
know is an external faculty member over here. She started this when she was a postdoc. Now she's

11:15.040 --> 11:20.480
in Colorado, and Jake Peters was a graduate student, and this is understanding ventilation, but not

11:20.480 --> 11:26.480
for termite mounds, ventilation in bee hives or bee boxes, and this was done not so far from Boston

11:26.480 --> 11:32.480
in our Concord Field Station. And then if I have time, I'll tell you about a third problem where

11:32.480 --> 11:36.400
we essentially brought everything into the lab. Initially we wanted to do this, but we haven't

11:36.400 --> 11:40.640
been able to. The third problem is associated with the third class of social insects. We haven't

11:40.640 --> 11:45.040
had a chance to work on wasps yet. I would love to find a way to do so. And the third problem is

11:45.040 --> 11:49.600
associated with understanding how architectures can be broken and built in the context of ants,

11:49.600 --> 11:54.000
which want to try and escape from a coral in which they are essentially initially placed.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.800
And then I want to gradually move from thinking about ants to robotic mimics of this. And the

11:58.800 --> 12:03.520
question over there is what are the necessary, what is the minimum necessary set of rules,

12:03.520 --> 12:07.760
and what is the minimum sufficient set of rules associated with having a programmable set of

12:07.760 --> 12:12.000
agents that can interact with each other and interact with an environment to be able to capture

12:12.000 --> 12:18.320
some aspects of the dynamics of organisms interacting with each other and with an environment,

12:18.320 --> 12:21.840
all of which are malleable. And this is work that continues, actually. It started out with

12:21.840 --> 12:28.080
Ganga Prasad and Sovik Mandal. Fabio built robots, and this was all a very close collaboration with

12:28.880 --> 12:33.040
a colleague of mine in biology, Venkimofi, who was very interested in collectively.

12:33.600 --> 12:40.800
Okay. So I'll give you the final result or way to think about, at least the way I've

12:40.800 --> 12:45.360
approached this problem. And then you can come back to the talk periodically. If you feel like

12:45.680 --> 12:51.040
a, every one of these I claim, and I'll show you evidence for, even though the problems that are

12:51.040 --> 12:55.600
solved on much larger scales associated with very simple local sensing rules and local actuation

12:55.600 --> 13:00.880
rules. And the key ingredient that I would like to emphasize is global physics, physics associated

13:00.880 --> 13:07.520
with how heat is moving around, how vibrations are moving around, how fluid dynamics plays a role,

13:07.520 --> 13:11.920
and coupled with simple local sensing and local actuation rules and global physics,

13:11.920 --> 13:16.080
you can get both function and architecture as the claim. And I want to essentially tell you how

13:16.080 --> 13:22.720
we think about this in all these problems. Okay. So termite mounds are remarkable. They are an

13:22.720 --> 13:28.160
ecosystem on their own. You can actually have collections of collections, if you want. These

13:28.160 --> 13:35.520
are collections of termite mounds from Australia. They're called magnetic termite mounds, wall

13:35.520 --> 13:39.600
termite mounds, which seem to be oriented roughly in a particular angle with respect to magnetic

13:39.600 --> 13:46.320
knots. So each mound can have millions of individuals. A termite itself is the size of a

13:46.320 --> 13:53.200
fingernail. And you find them everywhere except in Antarctica. Probably the most remarkable example

13:53.200 --> 14:02.400
of recent work in this space. This is England, Great Britain. This is the coast of South America.

14:03.360 --> 14:08.480
This is a set of termite mounds which was excavated five or six years ago.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.920
Look at the scale. It is not one mound. There are many mounds. A whole bunch of them.

14:14.960 --> 14:19.280
Hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. So they essentially have the capacity to completely

14:19.280 --> 14:24.080
change the ecology of the environment in which they are. So you can ask questions on the very,

14:24.080 --> 14:28.160
very large scale. You can ask questions on the intermediate scale or on the very small scale.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.880
And I'll talk about the intermediate and the small scale. What happens on the scale of an

14:30.880 --> 14:35.920
individual termite mound when I coarse-grain and look at it? What happens at the level of

14:35.920 --> 14:40.160
termites interacting with each other and with the termite mound as they build it? Those are the

14:40.160 --> 14:43.120
two scales in which I want to tell you about. I won't tell you anything about on the very large

14:43.120 --> 14:50.640
scale. So answering Sid's question, we started out, as I said, working on it in India with a

14:50.640 --> 14:55.920
particular species, Odontoktermis obesis. You know, a few millimeters in size. Termite mounds are

14:55.920 --> 15:01.200
hollow, but they are hollow on different scales. You don't have a chimney at the top,

15:01.760 --> 15:07.040
contrary to what sometimes is shown in children's books. This is a view from the top. You don't

15:07.040 --> 15:11.200
also have to have this very fluted structure. So for example, this is one from Namibia.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.760
It's more or less axi-symmetric. Certainly it doesn't have flutes. These ones are not.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.000
Under what conditions do you get it? Under what conditions you don't? I don't really have a sense

15:20.000 --> 15:25.360
of that. The ecologists and the natural historians haven't actually really, I think, quantified

15:25.360 --> 15:29.520
where and when you get this. So it's porous on multiple scales, and you can ask many questions.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.800
You know, what is this good for from a physiology point of view? How might it be built from a

15:32.800 --> 15:36.160
morphogenesis point of view? And what are the effects on ecology? And this is the question

15:36.160 --> 15:42.880
that I will not answer. I'll try and answer some of these two. Okay, so start with anatomy. So this

15:42.880 --> 15:47.520
is the anatomy of a termite mound. The most interesting part of the mound is not what you see

15:47.520 --> 15:53.200
above. It's below. It's what's called the gallery. And within this gallery is where the brood is,

15:53.200 --> 15:57.680
where most of the termites are most of the time. And along with the brood and the termites,

15:57.680 --> 16:03.680
you also have fungus. Essentially, the termites will bring water and fungi from their environment

16:03.680 --> 16:08.560
in the neighborhood of an individual mound, and they will use this to feed the brood and keep

16:08.560 --> 16:17.200
the entire environment moist. The gallery itself, you can't, of course, see until it erupts into

16:17.200 --> 16:20.480
a mound. So there's a very difficult question over here, which nobody's really addressed,

16:20.480 --> 16:24.800
which is on what are the conditions for the eruption of a mound? And nobody's been able

16:24.800 --> 16:29.360
to really build a mound in the lab. There are some attempts partially successful.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.400
Continuing to answer the questions that you raised, a collaborator of mine, I'm sorry,

16:34.400 --> 16:41.200
his name is not here, Rupert Soar basically took a mound, which we knew was not inhabited anymore.

16:41.200 --> 16:46.480
And how do we know this? We know this by essentially looking to see whether it starts to degrade over

16:46.480 --> 16:50.000
a period of time. And if there is no repair, then you know it very likely it's been abandoned.

16:51.120 --> 16:58.720
You can pour gypsum into it, allow that to precipitate. And then you can wash out the mud.

16:58.720 --> 17:04.720
And this is the negative image of a termite mound. So you have vast, almost vertical channels,

17:04.720 --> 17:09.520
which are themselves connected to each other. The termite mound is micro porous on the outside.

17:09.520 --> 17:13.760
And as you go further and further inside, it becomes more and more macro porous. So the porosity

17:13.760 --> 17:19.040
is got a gradient, small, many pores on the outside. As you go deeper and deeper, the pores

17:19.040 --> 17:24.800
become larger and larger. And you have essentially vertical channels. And of course, this would

17:24.800 --> 17:28.400
suggest that it has a very important part in ventilation. I'll show you some images associated

17:28.400 --> 17:35.440
with that. So what is the physiology of this? Best way to describe this is to ask my favorite

17:35.440 --> 17:42.880
naturalist and probably everybody's. Here in South Africa, it can also get very hot,

17:42.880 --> 17:49.040
but there's no danger of flooding. So termites can take refuge from the heat below ground,

17:49.040 --> 17:55.920
where it's cool and relatively stable. But two million insects living below ground

17:55.920 --> 18:03.360
create a different kind of problem. The air around them gets stale. So termites need to have a way

18:03.360 --> 18:09.760
of linking the underground air with the fresh air above a ventilation system. And they do that

18:11.120 --> 18:16.720
with this. And to see how it works, you've got to look inside.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.040
Using the latest scanning techniques, we can create a picture of the mound's interior.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.400
An intricate network of passages lead to a central chimney.

18:32.320 --> 18:37.840
Hot stale air from the insect population below rises up through the chimney.

18:41.840 --> 18:50.240
But the top of the mound is sealed. So how does this stale air escape? The mound may look as though

18:50.320 --> 18:56.080
it has strong defensive walls like a fortress. But in fact, these walls are porous, and their

18:56.080 --> 19:02.800
primary purpose is to harness the wind. Fresh air blowing against the side of the mound

19:02.800 --> 19:08.880
is forced through the tiny holes in these walls. From there, it travels through the smaller tunnels

19:08.880 --> 19:17.440
until it reaches the central chimney. Here, the cooler fresh air mixes with the hot stale air

19:17.520 --> 19:24.480
rising from the insect community below. Meanwhile, some air is blown around the side of the mound.

19:25.040 --> 19:31.520
This creates a suction that pulls the stale air out of the chimney and out through the outer walls.

19:32.160 --> 19:36.880
So an internal air current is created and the whole mound ventilated.

19:38.720 --> 19:43.200
The mound's inhabitants spend most of their time close to or below ground level.

19:44.160 --> 19:48.800
So he said, to De Bilan Mero said two things. First, he said that you have to have transport

19:48.800 --> 19:53.200
across the wall, which is porous, which of course makes a lot of sense. But in fact,

19:53.200 --> 19:57.040
as you know, because the pores are small, hydrodynamic effects are all going to be

19:57.040 --> 20:00.800
dominated by viscous forces. They're not going to be dominated by inertia. And he then said something

20:00.800 --> 20:05.840
else, which should have gotten all your antlers or your antenna up. And he said something about the

20:05.840 --> 20:10.800
fact that, oh, if I have air moving around it, then the velocity of the air is high,

20:10.800 --> 20:14.160
the pressure is low, and it's going to be suction. That can't be correct. And you can do an estimate

20:14.160 --> 20:22.720
of that. And so clearly, if you have porosity, part of the argument associated with transport,

20:23.360 --> 20:26.960
because of differences in concentration, is correct. But the airflow argument associated with

20:26.960 --> 20:32.480
Bernoulli is wrong. And so this is the kind of argument which has been around in the literature

20:32.480 --> 20:36.320
for a while. And we decided we'd go and measure things. We went to Namibia and we measured. What

20:36.320 --> 20:41.280
did we measure? So you can measure the fluid flow velocities outside. You can essentially drill

20:41.280 --> 20:46.720
holes into the termite mounds. And you can put in temperature sensors. And you can also have

20:46.720 --> 20:51.760
velocity sensors to measure. I want to emphasize velocity sensors, not just speed, but direction

20:51.760 --> 20:57.360
of the motion of the air inside. And then you can ask whether this is correct or not. And I'm going

20:57.360 --> 21:02.960
to summarize the story, because it's almost a decade old now. And the story is that the argument

21:02.960 --> 21:08.240
that Attenborough put forward is only partly correct. An important part was missed. And what

21:08.240 --> 21:11.840
is the important part that was missed? In fact, let me show you an image. And then I'm going to

21:11.840 --> 21:15.360
walk you through the argument. You know, our measurements and so on are there in this paper,

21:15.360 --> 21:19.840
which is, as I said, published almost a decade ago. I showed you this image in the beginning.

21:19.840 --> 21:25.520
This is a termite mound using regular light. This is an infrared during the day. And this is at

21:25.520 --> 21:31.360
night. And so what really happens is the following. The mound is heated during the day and it cools

21:31.360 --> 21:36.560
at night. But because the mound has a large thermal mass and therefore a thermal inertia,

21:36.560 --> 21:40.720
the entire mound can't be heated simultaneously. It has to be heated from the outside and gradually

21:40.720 --> 21:45.600
moves inwards. And so there's going to be a lag. If my thermal inertia is large enough,

21:45.600 --> 21:51.040
then the outside is warm during the day, the inside is cold, hasn't had chance to heat up,

21:51.040 --> 21:54.480
and exactly the reverse at night, because the inside is starting to warm up

21:54.480 --> 21:58.560
during the day, outside starts to cool quickly. That means you have thermal gradients.

21:58.640 --> 22:03.280
And these thermal gradients in space are a function of temperature variations in time.

22:03.280 --> 22:09.840
So in fact, the termite mound actually is a heat engine, which instead of working between two,

22:10.880 --> 22:14.560
a source and a sink in temperature, as we are used to thinking in thermodynamics,

22:14.560 --> 22:19.600
which are kept at constant temperature, now in fact, the source and sink are oscillating.

22:19.600 --> 22:25.920
And the mound is harnessing this temperature variation in time to create spatial flows

22:25.920 --> 22:31.280
inside the mound, which we measure. So during the day, the outside of the mound is hot,

22:31.280 --> 22:37.040
the air right inside is warm. As a consequence, air is going to rise. But because the air can't

22:37.040 --> 22:41.840
leave because of the microporosity, so during the day, you have cycles like this, which we measure.

22:43.280 --> 22:48.400
And at night, the outside starts to cool, so the mound air, sorry, the air in the mound just

22:48.400 --> 22:52.640
inside starts to cool, it starts to sink, and the whole thing reverses. And so when will this

22:52.640 --> 22:57.520
happen? It's not going to happen continuously, it's going to happen at dusk and a dawn, or slightly

22:57.520 --> 23:04.560
after dusk and slightly before dawn, which means that the mound is a lung, and it's a lung driven

23:04.560 --> 23:11.760
by temperature variations. And the mound essentially breathes twice a day. In us, our lungs work

23:11.760 --> 23:15.280
primarily because of our diaphragm. Our diaphragm is essentially fundamentally what is essentially

23:15.280 --> 23:19.680
pushing and pulling air in and out of the lungs. And instead of the diaphragm providing the muscular

23:19.680 --> 23:24.320
forces in us, over here, temperature variations are essentially giving rise to the same thing.

23:24.320 --> 23:29.600
And so we measured this in dead mounds. To be sure that we were right, we said, ah, in a live

23:29.600 --> 23:32.800
mound, if this is the same thing, if this is happening in a live mound, which we know is live,

23:32.800 --> 23:37.440
as I said, because it's under construction, we can see termites. In a dead mound, we see exactly

23:37.440 --> 23:42.080
the same thing. Both in a live and a dead mound, we see the same thing. And we did this with two

23:42.080 --> 23:47.200
different species on two different continents. We did this in Africa, in Namibia. We did this

23:47.280 --> 23:54.960
in India with a different species. In Africa, in the temperate region, temperature variations are

23:54.960 --> 23:59.840
much larger. And I'm going to come back to this. So therefore, you have much larger variations

23:59.840 --> 24:03.440
to temperature between day and night. The consequence of that is the velocity should be much

24:03.440 --> 24:07.040
larger. In India, the temperature variations are much smaller. The velocity should be smaller.

24:07.040 --> 24:12.800
All that checks out. And the idea that it works like a lung, here is the evidence for this.

24:12.800 --> 24:17.520
So what I'm showing you over here is what's happening in the nest and the gallery and what's

24:17.520 --> 24:22.800
happening in the chimney. The carbon dioxide concentration starts to go up during the day,

24:23.440 --> 24:30.080
as the termites are physiologically active. And then when at about 6 or 7 p.m., when this entire

24:30.080 --> 24:36.320
cycle reverses, instead of having flows like this, the flows reverse, you excavate the bottom,

24:36.320 --> 24:40.000
you excavate the gallery. And when you excavate the gallery, the carbon dioxide comes up. And

24:40.000 --> 24:43.520
when the carbon dioxide comes up, the concentration of carbon dioxide inside is high compared to

24:43.520 --> 24:48.240
outside. Now the porosity kicks in because the concentration difference allows you to

24:48.240 --> 24:54.080
essentially equilibrate. So you have large-scale flows coupled to small-scale diffusion,

24:54.080 --> 25:00.240
all driven by a heat source and a heat sink, which are fluctuating. So this is an interesting

25:00.240 --> 25:07.680
observation, if only because it suggests that unlike our heat engines, animals don't have to work

25:07.680 --> 25:13.360
at constant source and constant sink temperatures, you can have fluctuating versions of this.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.480
Okay, so I'll leave it at that. A second question that this raises is when I said, ah,

25:18.480 --> 25:22.800
the thermal inertia is large, if the thermal inertia was not large, of course, temperatures

25:22.800 --> 25:25.920
will equilibrate quickly. And if temperature equilibrate quickly, you don't have to have any

25:25.920 --> 25:31.040
of this. And so that begs the question, how in the world do termites figure out how to

25:31.040 --> 25:36.400
build a structure of this kind so that it actually works? And I want to introduce another

25:36.400 --> 25:41.120
naturalist, evolutionary biologist, who basically poses the question and then I'll show you

25:41.120 --> 25:47.280
an attempt at an answer. Okay. Now what's fascinating to me about this is that if you came

25:47.280 --> 25:54.720
across a building like that, you'd assume that some architect had designed it and he'd had a blueprint

25:54.720 --> 26:00.240
of some kind, right, the drawing of how it was going to go, and he told people exactly what to do.

26:00.800 --> 26:06.160
Now, this termite mine, nobody had an image of the complete building. I mean, no termite has a

26:06.160 --> 26:12.160
picture of the whole mound. All the termites do is they, they build a mound and they're following

26:12.160 --> 26:19.280
some rules. And to be honest, I don't think we know exactly what those rules are. My guess is that

26:19.280 --> 26:25.920
they're fairly, fairly simple. So he gives it at that. What are they doing? What are they doing?

26:26.160 --> 26:32.320
Fairly simple. So he gives it at that. What are the rules? How can we essentially now connect

26:32.320 --> 26:37.200
the building behavior to the environmental changes? Because the building behavior will

26:37.200 --> 26:41.120
change the environment. The environment will then feed back and change the behavior. For

26:41.120 --> 26:45.360
example, if I build a mound, there are only certain places that the termites can get to.

26:45.360 --> 26:52.160
So can we now understand how to couple the physics of the environment to the behavioral

26:52.160 --> 26:57.280
biology of the organism? So don't separate out, this part is living and this part is not living.

27:00.160 --> 27:05.520
So here's a cartoon. And here's a phrase which essentially summarizes everything.

27:06.240 --> 27:10.480
You know, so Churchill famously said, we shape our buildings after they shape us. Well,

27:10.480 --> 27:15.520
in the context of termites, the mound morphology clearly will influence the airflow. I've already

27:15.520 --> 27:19.600
shown you, at least I wave my hands and told you how it works. We have some measurements of that.

27:19.600 --> 27:23.200
The airflow is going to change the olfactory currents. It's going to change the pheromone

27:23.200 --> 27:27.680
concentrations. The pheromone concentrations are going to change the termite behavior. And the termite

27:27.680 --> 27:32.640
behavior is going to change the mind morphology. So you can't anymore separate out the organism

27:32.640 --> 27:36.320
from the environment just as we can't separate out the brain from the body. We have to think

27:36.320 --> 27:40.400
about all these things together. So how do we unpack this? And I'll show you two ways of unpacking

27:40.400 --> 27:45.360
this. First is understanding the coarse-grained morphology of the termite mound. And second,

27:45.360 --> 27:49.440
I'm going to show you CAT scans of the mound itself. And then I'm going to see how to unpack

27:49.440 --> 27:55.280
the fine-grained morphology. First thing that you notice is that termite mounds are conical.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.800
The aspect ratio is, they're not spheres. In fact, I'm going to show you examples.

28:00.800 --> 28:05.680
Termite mounds, which you see in environments which are shady or termite mounds on trees,

28:05.680 --> 28:10.240
they're much closer to spherical. So first question is, how come they become tall? And

28:10.880 --> 28:15.360
I don't have to, I think, explain to this audience that one way to break symmetry is to use buoyancy.

28:16.560 --> 28:22.480
Because as soon as I heat the air, heat air is going to move up and down much faster than sideways.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.880
And if I essentially have buoyancy, that means I can move pheromones much faster in one direction

28:26.880 --> 28:31.360
compared to the other. That means, therefore, I'll be able to build more in one direction compared

28:31.360 --> 28:35.200
to the other if the pheromones were essentially responsible for the behavior of the termite.

28:35.840 --> 28:40.240
And as a consequence, and I'll show you some scaling laws for that in just a minute,

28:40.240 --> 28:44.880
as a consequence, you would expect that as you move from environments where the temperature

28:44.880 --> 28:48.720
variations are small to environment where temperature variations are large,

28:48.720 --> 28:53.920
the mound should become larger. This has been known for 100 years. If you go to the savanna,

28:53.920 --> 28:58.560
you go to parts of southern Africa, you go to the temperate zones, the mounds can be 3,

28:58.560 --> 29:02.960
3.5, 4 meters. You go to India, they are smaller. You go to a tree, they're even smaller. So already

29:02.960 --> 29:07.280
you say, ah, that the physics of the environment is playing a very important role. Can I essentially

29:07.280 --> 29:14.160
unpack that? So here is an attempt to do that. I've already, this is a cartoon. I'm going to assume

29:14.160 --> 29:18.480
axi-symmetry. You have all kinds of interesting questions associated with how you break axi-symmetry.

29:18.480 --> 29:24.480
We haven't addressed them. This is what I told you a minute or two ago that associated with

29:24.480 --> 29:31.920
diurnal variations in temperature. You have heat and therefore air moving around. That means

29:32.000 --> 29:37.760
pheromones are moving around. And the simplest rule for biology, for behavior, is you build if

29:37.760 --> 29:41.600
the concentration of pheromones increases past the critical value, you stop and then you allow

29:41.600 --> 29:45.760
things to degrade if the pheromone concentration does not. That's it. That's the only place

29:45.760 --> 29:50.480
where I introduce a behavioral rule. Minimally, I have to therefore couple three different fields.

29:51.120 --> 29:58.000
Temperature, which is the driving source of all that's happening. It's a function nominally of

29:58.000 --> 30:05.920
time, but it becomes a function of space, s and z, z and s in the radial direction because I'm

30:05.920 --> 30:13.040
thinking about a conducting porous material, a velocity which is driven by temperature variations

30:13.040 --> 30:16.480
because of buoyancy and then pheromone concentration because they're essentially moved around. So

30:16.480 --> 30:21.760
minimally, we have to have these three fields and forget the equations. I'll just describe what they

30:21.760 --> 30:25.840
mean, which I think is very intuitive. Dienal oscillation would change in time with a frequency

30:25.840 --> 30:31.920
which is one over 24 hours. Heat flow, so temperature variations are driven by advection

30:31.920 --> 30:36.880
because of the fluid flow and they also have diffusion. Fluid flow, this is a porous medium,

30:36.880 --> 30:40.640
it's driven essentially by temperature variations. Temperature variations lead to buoyancy and the

30:40.640 --> 30:44.640
fluid is assumed to be incompressible. And the pheromone is advected by the fluid, it diffuses

30:44.640 --> 30:48.480
and it has a source. And the source of all the pheromones are in the gallery because that's

30:48.480 --> 30:55.440
where most of the termites are most of the time. Those are my equations. Here is the only place

30:55.440 --> 31:01.120
where the biology quote comes in. You build, if the pheromone concentration becomes large,

31:01.120 --> 31:05.200
then large in a critical value, you stop building or you essentially let it degrade and that's

31:05.200 --> 31:13.520
coming in otherwise. That's it. What are the parameters? So there is a thickness of the wall,

31:13.520 --> 31:17.440
which is where you have microporosity, after which you have this microporosity. There's a

31:17.440 --> 31:22.080
thermal diffusion length, which is essentially associated with how much of the mound you can

31:22.160 --> 31:26.800
heat or cool during the day or night. There is a buoyancy parameter, which is telling you

31:26.800 --> 31:31.600
as a function of the temperature variations how fast or how slow is the fluid flow moving up and

31:31.600 --> 31:37.600
down. And there is a pheromone penetration depth. And that is the idea that if I have a source of

31:37.600 --> 31:42.720
pheromones and I just uniformly allow them to diffuse, there comes a critical distance beyond

31:42.720 --> 31:46.400
which the concentration has fallen down below critical value. And if it's fallen down below

31:46.400 --> 31:50.320
critical value, you won't build larger than that. And if there was no temperature variation,

31:50.960 --> 31:55.760
or sorry, if there was no buoyancy, then this would be isotropic, so you get a spherical

31:55.760 --> 32:00.480
termite mound. The reason that you get an elongated mound is precisely and only because

32:01.120 --> 32:06.480
the termites are harnessing the buoyancy without even thinking about it, to have pheromones move

32:06.480 --> 32:11.040
much faster in the vertical direction because of buoyancy and only slowly diffuse in the horizontal

32:11.040 --> 32:18.160
direction. So you're assuming that the pheromones would produce their constant rate.

32:18.480 --> 32:23.440
That anything beyond that will essentially make the problem more complicated. But yes,

32:23.440 --> 32:28.000
in the simplest setting, I'm assuming that there is a source of pheromones that's uniform and at

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
one location. You can start making all kinds of complexities beyond that. Yes, indeed.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.320
Yeah.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.800
Which is known? Yes.

32:52.080 --> 32:58.320
No, most over there, they're mostly excavating. All the building is happening above. So in the

32:58.320 --> 33:04.160
gallery, there's a lot of porosity. Okay. Okay. So, but that's where the brood is,

33:04.160 --> 33:10.080
and the brood are metabolically very active. So there's a huge source of pheromones and humidity,

33:10.080 --> 33:14.080
water vapor, consequence of respiration, right there. But I don't know what was the...

33:15.280 --> 33:19.440
There's a motion assumption here that I don't know. So you're assuming something about the

33:19.440 --> 33:24.480
distribution of termites across the structure, and that's not... It's not here because I've

33:24.480 --> 33:29.440
zoomed out and I'm thinking about not the individual dynamics of the termites. I'll come

33:29.440 --> 33:33.840
back to that when I think about a second level of a model, which is more fine-grained. Here,

33:33.840 --> 33:37.920
I'm saying I'm thinking about the termite mount as it's being built over an entire season.

33:37.920 --> 33:41.600
So you're assuming that they're somehow uniformly spread over the structure?

33:41.600 --> 33:47.680
I am assuming nothing about them except the fact that the order production is happening

33:47.680 --> 33:53.360
at a particular location with a particular rate. Right. Okay. If the termites were actually moving

33:53.360 --> 33:57.120
around and depositing it, if you hold on, I will show you a more fine-grained model,

33:57.120 --> 34:00.640
which asks, what is the fine-grained structure? And I think part of the message,

34:00.640 --> 34:05.760
perhaps, which I should have said, and maybe I'll say now, is I'm going to build a sequence of models,

34:05.760 --> 34:10.400
actually in this case, two models. One for the coarse-grained perspective to understand

34:10.400 --> 34:14.960
the aspect ratio and the size of the mount. Another one for the fine-grained structure,

34:14.960 --> 34:19.680
because I'm going to show you with CAT scans that, in fact, the mount has a layered,

34:19.680 --> 34:24.160
smectic-like behavior, smectic-like structure, you know, like a parking garage. And in order

34:24.160 --> 34:28.720
to understand that, I'll have to start worrying about the dynamics of termites which are loaded

34:28.720 --> 34:33.360
with cement, termites which are essentially unloaded and moving around, and how the air

34:33.360 --> 34:38.000
is moving through all that I will build in at a more fine-grained level, if you will,

34:38.000 --> 34:43.440
just wait for a couple of minutes. Question. More questions. Yeah.

34:43.440 --> 34:48.720
So you said, you know, this still holds in the gallery. In the gallery, they're always active

34:48.720 --> 34:54.080
because of the concentration of pheromones. In this case, I'm assuming that the gallery

34:54.080 --> 34:58.160
is where most of the pheromones are produced. There could be pheromones produced elsewhere,

34:58.160 --> 35:03.120
but I'm assuming that the concentration of pheromones elsewhere is a consequence of

35:03.120 --> 35:07.600
being produced in large amounts at the base, and then moving around because of either diffusion

35:07.600 --> 35:12.880
or buoyancy. I guess it's just for my mental picture. Is the gallery always increasing in size?

35:12.880 --> 35:20.000
No, no, no. The gallery is first built, reaches a critical size. I don't know. We don't know what

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
the critical size is. And then, and only then, does the mound start to erupt outwards. Upwards,

35:26.000 --> 35:33.440
sorry. Okay. So I've told you the parameters. There are three-dimensionalist parameters from

35:33.440 --> 35:39.760
these four scales. There are two scaling laws, which I'm going to tell you about, which we can

35:39.760 --> 35:44.160
calculate as consequences of these equations, but I could just directly read off once I know

35:44.160 --> 35:49.280
what the parameters are. One is the aspect ratio. What is the height compared to the radius?

35:49.840 --> 35:54.960
And the most important thing is its non-unity, and the reason it's non-unity is because of the

35:54.960 --> 35:59.520
presence of this quantity, which I'm going to call a Peclet number. It's related to things

35:59.520 --> 36:03.760
that have dynamics associated with how diffusion and advection play off against each other.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.360
And what is this saying? This Peclet number is a ratio of this quantity

36:08.320 --> 36:13.120
to this quantity, a pheromone penetration to buoyancy. So what is that really saying? That means

36:13.120 --> 36:17.440
if the Peclet number is small, it's dominated by diffusion, therefore it's going to remain spherical.

36:17.440 --> 36:21.280
If the Peclet number is large, that means the buoyancy length is large, which means you have

36:21.280 --> 36:25.600
very, very large flows in the vertical direction, which means that the aspect ratio becomes very,

36:25.600 --> 36:30.960
very large. Okay. And the reason it's a square, you must expect it should go at least as a square,

36:30.960 --> 36:34.720
is because the symmetry doesn't matter which way it's going, whether it's up or down. So you could

36:34.720 --> 36:38.320
have just guessed that, but in fact, you can calculate it and you can do the numerics solving

36:38.320 --> 36:44.640
these PDEs and you find that that's correct. And there is another lens at timescale and the

36:44.640 --> 36:48.160
timescale is associated with how long does it take to reach steady state. Why will it reach a

36:48.160 --> 36:52.000
steady state? And this is a non-equilibrium steady state. It reaches a steady state because

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
eventually the pheromone concentration on the walls reaches phi star. And once it reaches

36:56.000 --> 37:00.480
phi star, it can't grow anymore outwards. And similarly, once you reach steady velocity,

37:00.480 --> 37:05.760
it can't grow to large in a critical height. And that characteristic time, not surprisingly,

37:06.800 --> 37:11.360
is related to, I'm going to call this the BI, the BO number, which for all kinds of

37:11.360 --> 37:15.680
historical reasons is named for the scientist BO, and it's characterized by this thermal diffusion

37:15.680 --> 37:23.200
lens. So how much does that heat penetrate in or out of this? And you can calculate solutions,

37:23.840 --> 37:28.640
which I'm going to show you when here are solutions of the PDEs, which show you different

37:28.640 --> 37:34.800
kinds of mounds. And you can qualitatively, but only qualitatively see that they don't

37:35.760 --> 37:43.440
have a complete discordance with observations. I mean, I can't say that they capture all of it,

37:43.440 --> 37:50.160
but qualitatively they're correct. But question. Sorry, on that. So if the population were growing.

37:50.160 --> 37:56.240
Very good. Yeah, ask the question. Well, that final inequality then would not be here.

37:56.320 --> 38:00.560
Indeed. And if the populations are growing, termite mound will continuously grow. And so now,

38:00.560 --> 38:05.200
and this is where you get a second mound, which starts to come up. Because what happens is there

38:05.200 --> 38:09.120
are two possibilities. One is just you grow this individual mound, but then that means you're

38:09.600 --> 38:15.200
depleting resources from the immediate neighborhood. You're depleting water, you're depleting fungus,

38:15.200 --> 38:19.120
and so there is a characteristic scale beyond which it's no longer efficient to keep growing

38:19.120 --> 38:24.240
this one mound. Instead, you'll find a second mound that grows. And in fact, I should say, so

38:24.240 --> 38:31.120
we worked in Namibia for two seasons. And in India for three seasons. What we found is that

38:31.120 --> 38:36.560
mounds will be built in a period of three to four months. In India, the monsoon essentially washes

38:36.560 --> 38:44.640
out almost everything in Namibia. We found often that grazing animals use this as a backscratcher,

38:44.640 --> 38:49.840
and they will destroy it. But in either case, rarely do you have a mound which will essentially

38:49.840 --> 38:53.600
persist over, for example, we came back after a year, and most of the mounds we were studying were

38:53.600 --> 38:59.040
gone. So there are much more sophisticated analysis associated with the timescale over

38:59.040 --> 39:02.320
which you would expect this to stay. I don't really know. I don't have anything to say.

39:03.520 --> 39:09.200
But I do want to now zoom in. You can see I hope these mounds, these are cross sections of mounds,

39:09.200 --> 39:14.080
and you see the mounds are actually layered structures. And I want to now tell you a little

39:14.080 --> 39:25.360
bit about them. So not the macromorphogenesis, but the macromorphogenesis zooming in. And here's

39:25.360 --> 39:30.880
an image from our collaborator, Geethe Rallos, who studies collective behavior in Toulouse,

39:32.480 --> 39:36.800
took one of the West African mounds. This is a much smaller one. Look at the size over here. These

39:36.800 --> 39:43.520
are small of the order of something that you can hold in your hand. And you see this beautiful

39:43.600 --> 39:49.360
smectic structure. In fact, if you, you know, like love these kind of ordered structures,

39:50.080 --> 39:53.920
and familiar with liquid crystals, for example, where you have nematics, smectics,

39:54.560 --> 40:01.360
smectics A, smectics C, and then you have cholesterics and all, and like a discoid liquid

40:01.360 --> 40:07.600
crystals and polarized liquid crystals and whatnot, you know that you get defects,

40:07.600 --> 40:13.120
edge dislocations, screw dislocations, so you see all these structures. But very importantly,

40:13.200 --> 40:18.800
unlike in liquid crystals, where those are consequences of a very racial principle associated

40:18.800 --> 40:23.280
with minimizing energy, here these are arising from non-equilibrium considerations. There's nothing

40:23.280 --> 40:28.000
about the system, which is at equilibrium. And yet, because of the geometry, you are

40:29.040 --> 40:34.640
inevitably going to be forced to have dislocations. And these dislocations, as I said, can take the

40:34.640 --> 40:40.720
form of edge and screw dislocations. How do we understand these? Okay, same picture. I have to

40:40.720 --> 40:47.920
couple the environment with the behavior, and with the airflow. In this case, I'm going to

40:47.920 --> 40:52.000
think of now three fluids interacting with each other. As I said, the population of a termite

40:52.000 --> 40:56.960
mound can be in the order of millions. I have two classes of termite mounds, mounds, termites,

40:56.960 --> 41:02.640
which are loaded. So they have a bit of clay, particle of clay that they're moving around.

41:03.600 --> 41:08.320
I have termite mounds which are unloaded. The mounds which are loaded are going to essentially

41:08.400 --> 41:13.680
respond to gradients in pheromone and then drop the nest material at some particular location.

41:13.680 --> 41:21.120
That changes the local porosity. That local porosity changes the dynamics of how the pheromone is

41:21.120 --> 41:25.280
moving around in the presence or in the absence of airflow. That then changes the behavior of the

41:25.280 --> 41:28.480
termite. And we have to essentially couple these exactly like what I was showing you before.

41:29.200 --> 41:34.320
What Guy and his collaborators had shown a couple of years before, we started working on this

41:34.320 --> 41:39.040
by looking at the behavior of individual termites in a Petri dish. So they weren't able to build

41:39.040 --> 41:45.040
anything on the scale of a mound itself, but they were able to build small attempts that the

41:45.040 --> 41:49.760
termites made to create these layered structures. And they found that the building rate is proportional

41:49.760 --> 41:53.920
to first approximation of the pheromone concentration. And the removal rate is not

41:53.920 --> 41:58.480
proportional. It's constant. So they essentially build more and more in response to higher and

41:58.480 --> 42:02.080
higher concentrations. But then when they break it, they break it at a uniform rate.

42:02.240 --> 42:08.320
And I'm going to use this in a model. And here is my model. And I'm sorry, it's a bit messy.

42:09.120 --> 42:14.400
But let me explain what the physics is associated with each one of these equations. And these are

42:14.400 --> 42:18.720
just essentially conservation laws and some reaction diffusion type equations. Let me explain

42:18.720 --> 42:25.920
what. So the nest material, U is the nest material. When U varies from zero to one, it's either not

42:25.920 --> 42:33.680
there at all or it's solid when it's one. Nest material is moved around in consequence of termites

42:33.680 --> 42:39.440
which are loaded and destroyed because of termites which are essentially taking material away.

42:39.440 --> 42:44.560
N plus and N minus are the populations of the termites which are loaded and unloaded.

42:44.560 --> 42:50.960
And the nest, when it's being built, is assumed to be a soft porous solid. So it's like clay,

42:50.960 --> 42:55.760
which will gradually settle down. And that's settling down. We build in through this term over

42:55.760 --> 43:02.000
here. G is an effective gravity. It's essentially just loading the system. The fact that this is a

43:02.000 --> 43:07.120
diffusion equation is consistent with the case. If I have a porous system which is just heavy

43:07.120 --> 43:10.960
without any loading or unloading, without activity, it will start to sag. That's essentially why the

43:10.960 --> 43:16.240
Leaning Tower of Pisa is leaning over large periods of time because of differences in the

43:16.240 --> 43:20.720
foundation and the soil around it. It starts to essentially degrade. So that's the nest material.

43:21.040 --> 43:26.160
The termite workers themselves are diffusing their chemo-tactic because they essentially

43:26.160 --> 43:32.400
respond to gradients in the soil through chemo-tactic coefficient. And the termite workers themselves

43:32.400 --> 43:37.840
can switch from being loaded to unloaded with a rate k. This diffusivity which is non-linear is

43:37.840 --> 43:42.480
simply there because you can't have any diffusivity when u is equal to 1 since it's a solid. So it's

43:42.480 --> 43:46.480
essentially completely gone. When u is equal to 1, it's a solid. Therefore, the termites can't move

43:46.480 --> 43:53.440
at all. And finally, the pheromone concentration is diffusion. There is addition because of the

43:53.440 --> 43:59.120
pheromones, because of the termites which are loaded. And there is a rate of degradation.

43:59.120 --> 44:03.040
And the building and removal rates are very simple forms which essentially are proportional to the

44:03.040 --> 44:07.520
loading of the loaded termites or the unloaded termites. And this u times 1 minus u is precisely

44:07.520 --> 44:13.840
again so that it vanishes when you have no material and it also vanishes when there is only a solid.

44:14.480 --> 44:20.720
So you can do a linear stability analysis and pull out the dimensionless parameters.

44:20.720 --> 44:25.120
And the key dimensionless parameters that matter are the rate at which

44:26.720 --> 44:33.840
diffusion and degradation arise in the pheromone concentration, a rate associated with the settling,

44:33.840 --> 44:40.640
and the chemo-tactic coefficient. How strongly or how weakly do the termites respond to gradients

44:40.640 --> 44:49.120
in pheromones? Here is an example of a simulation. I hope that you can see it. You get this layered

44:49.120 --> 44:55.200
structure. The layer spacing is essentially, it shouldn't surprise you, anybody who's looked

44:55.200 --> 45:00.160
at these reaction diffusion equations, you always get a spacing when you balance degradation with

45:00.160 --> 45:03.600
diffusion. There's a characteristic length scale, which is this square root of those two. It turns

45:03.600 --> 45:08.800
out for the values that we have in the system, this characteristic balance between diffusion and

45:08.800 --> 45:15.520
degradation dominate and give you this spacing. No surprises that you also get edge dislocation

45:15.520 --> 45:19.040
like structures and you also get screw dislocation like structures because you will never be able

45:19.040 --> 45:24.000
to build perfectly when you're trying to essentially get layers. The only last point which I want to

45:24.000 --> 45:28.560
make is what sets the orientation of the layers and the orientation of the layers is set by

45:28.560 --> 45:32.640
gravity. It's essentially right there because otherwise you could say, oh, why should it be

45:33.440 --> 45:36.800
layered this way? Why can't it be layered this way? Or why can't it be layered that way? And that's

45:36.800 --> 45:42.320
because the settling is happening in one direction. So gravity in a very humble but profound, I would

45:42.320 --> 45:48.560
say, way dominates both the physics of the large scale buoyancy driven circulation and on this

45:48.560 --> 45:56.720
small scale setting the polarization of the layer orientation as well. Okay, that's my second

45:56.960 --> 46:08.080
story about mound micro morphogenesis and I hope that it's clear no plan, no planner, there isn't

46:08.080 --> 46:13.040
even a representation of the task. Okay, we think about intelligence requiring representation,

46:13.040 --> 46:20.240
there is no representation anywhere. There is all that's happening is local sensing and local

46:20.240 --> 46:26.240
action and out of that you can essentially get these structures and I want to emphasize

46:26.320 --> 46:30.400
these are also out of equilibrium. They are not solutions of any variation problems even though

46:30.400 --> 46:36.640
they look like they may have a variational way of getting there, for example, in the crystals.

46:36.640 --> 46:41.280
So therefore they're both repairable and they're also adaptable. They're repairable because if I

46:41.280 --> 46:46.080
monkey around with what happens at one location, immediately these dynamics will essentially change

46:46.080 --> 46:50.800
the way in the pheromone moves around and therefore it will repair itself and it's also adaptable

46:50.800 --> 46:54.640
for the same reason because if the temperature variations are present, then you will essentially

46:54.640 --> 47:00.080
upscale or downscale the pattern. I'm just wondering what limits the size of the pheromone

47:00.080 --> 47:08.800
and also the size of the population. So the size I believe is associated with the population,

47:08.800 --> 47:14.000
it's scaled with the population. Now you're asking what sets the population and I don't

47:14.000 --> 47:20.240
know the answer. I do know that what has been seen and that's primarily in these three

47:20.800 --> 47:29.200
mounds, so they're not really mounds, they're much smaller nests. You will see characteristic

47:29.200 --> 47:35.680
population and term and mound size correlate very well. In the context of mounds on the ground,

47:36.400 --> 47:39.760
you have to have ground penetrating radar or something of that sort to be able to first

47:39.760 --> 47:44.160
know where to even look and then start asking the question. I don't really have a whole lot to say.

47:44.800 --> 47:51.840
Context of how long do they persist? I think the question that you're asking is a question of

47:51.840 --> 47:58.640
is it more efficient to repair a mound or as it ages and it's physical aging or is it better

47:58.640 --> 48:05.440
to start a new mound and so that's I think now much harder question to understand in the absence

48:05.440 --> 48:11.040
of any data. I mean you can make up a story that past some age it just becomes very hard to continuously

48:11.040 --> 48:15.840
repair the mounds and then you start making another one but that's my stories as good as yours.

48:16.880 --> 48:23.280
Okay all right so I have 10 minutes or less? Okay so I want to switch maybe I'll just give

48:23.280 --> 48:28.640
you a brief view. I think you must have heard some of it from Orit. I'll give you...

48:29.520 --> 48:36.480
Do you know any of the communication industry of this and strategies? I mean all that term

48:36.480 --> 48:43.600
might sort of crap at building mounds or is there any comparative data that gives you a feeling for that?

48:48.160 --> 48:53.600
There probably is. I am not able to recall having quantitative data. I can tell you about

48:53.600 --> 48:57.840
quantitative data from an evolutionary point of view associated with the fact that because we've

48:57.840 --> 49:03.920
studied three different species in three different continents you know the size of the mound, the

49:03.920 --> 49:11.360
shape of the mound we can qualitatively understand using these scaling laws. Temperature variations

49:11.360 --> 49:16.480
becoming larger, the mound becomes larger, populations becoming larger, the mound becoming

49:16.480 --> 49:20.480
larger. If you're now asking me can you predict the exponents? I mean we can but can you essentially

49:20.480 --> 49:30.800
verify anything? No, zero. I mean these experiments, yeah, no. So the only part of the history is we've

49:30.800 --> 49:35.120
studied three different species in three different continents. They're all conforming with the model.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.880
They are qualitatively consistent.

49:42.240 --> 49:48.560
You know I have another life where we actually study just the physics of things where I think we can

49:48.560 --> 49:55.040
be a lot more hard-nosed about exponents and phase diagrams and so on and if I try to compare it with

49:55.040 --> 50:01.360
that part we are very far away unfortunately. So this is all qualitative at this point,

50:01.360 --> 50:09.280
unfortunately. Okay, all right. In the next 10 minutes I want to first give you a view of the

50:09.280 --> 50:12.640
kinds of problems we've studied with bees but I won't tell you about any of them and then I'll

50:12.640 --> 50:18.400
switch to ants if I have a little bit of time but I'm also happy to stop after. It's okay. So this is

50:18.560 --> 50:27.040
a bee beard if you like in the Concord Field Station and you know on a day like this actually

50:27.040 --> 50:34.960
at a time like this but probably about seven years ago or so, eight years ago and so you know this

50:34.960 --> 50:43.440
cluster of bees is hanging by essentially holding on to its neighbors. Okay and why is it doing this?

50:43.440 --> 50:48.960
So probably the most famous thing that everybody knows about in the context of collective behavior

50:48.960 --> 50:54.000
of bees is associated with the waggle dance. Okay so when the bees essentially have to make a

50:54.000 --> 51:02.240
decision about creating or moving to a new home then there's this remarkable set of events. First

51:02.240 --> 51:09.760
I think described by Carl von Frisch in the 1930s and 40s for which as I said he and Thinbergen

51:09.760 --> 51:16.720
and Conrad Lorenz shared Nobel Prize in 1967 and 68 where the bees essentially signal to each other

51:16.720 --> 51:24.480
by waggling their bodies, changing their orientation and having more or less vigor associated with a

51:26.480 --> 51:30.960
location. Once that decision has been made the bees have to move from one location to the other

51:30.960 --> 51:36.000
and they typically move in over a period of days so they don't have the capacity to do this in one

51:36.000 --> 51:42.080
day and if they do this as it will typically happen at this time of the year early spring then

51:42.080 --> 51:46.480
there's a potential problem which is that they may freeze at night and to prevent freezing at night

51:46.480 --> 51:50.480
they essentially have to create a bivouac for the night for maybe two nights maybe three nights

51:50.480 --> 51:54.720
and this is the kind of bivouac that they treat where where they create where they essentially

51:54.720 --> 52:00.400
hold on to each other so this is a potential solution to two problems one you need to be

52:00.400 --> 52:05.360
mechanically stable so you have to hold on to the branch not at one point but over some finite

52:05.360 --> 52:11.360
length of the branch or the bow and another is to essentially minimize the amount of surface to

52:11.360 --> 52:16.880
reduce the amount of loss heat loss and there's very nice questions not just associated with

52:16.880 --> 52:22.800
how they form these structures but even the structure of the structure itself which means

52:22.800 --> 52:26.400
what which means what type of bees are on the outside and what type of bees on the inside

52:26.400 --> 52:30.880
for example we know due to the work of Bernd Heinrich from the 1970s that in fact the younger

52:30.880 --> 52:34.640
bees are on the inside the older bees on the outside not only that the bees on the outside

52:34.640 --> 52:41.200
have pneumatic order okay so a very beautiful set of questions associated with trying to minimize

52:41.200 --> 52:47.200
the thermal shock and the mechanical shock so a few years ago with Jake Peters and Ulpela we studied

52:47.200 --> 52:54.720
this and I want to show you an experiment where Jake did and I won't tell you what the theory

52:54.720 --> 53:00.560
which was done a few years ago so here's an experiment Jake basically took a piece of wood

53:01.440 --> 53:06.480
created a little cage to which he attached which he attached to the piece of wood and within which

53:07.120 --> 53:12.960
he also had a queen and then the bees essentially aggregated around that and he put this whole

53:12.960 --> 53:17.600
thing inside a box and changed the temperature so you want to essentially understand how does this

53:17.600 --> 53:22.160
cluster respond to temperature variations okay let me show you

53:22.400 --> 53:34.400
the temperature is cycling from between 15 degrees 14 degrees or so the bees will go into a chill

53:34.400 --> 53:40.960
coma and it's changing over a period of a few hours and what you see is essentially a porous

53:40.960 --> 53:47.280
medium which is capable of responding by becoming more porous or less porous it becomes more porous

53:47.280 --> 53:52.400
as it heats up and becomes less porous as it cools down what does that mean that means that

53:52.400 --> 53:56.080
it becomes hotter and hotter you essentially create change the porosity and by changing the porosity

53:56.080 --> 54:00.640
you can essentially get airflow and by changing the airflow you can get dynamics and cooling and

54:00.640 --> 54:07.040
then when it cold when it becomes cold it shrinks and you know we understand we teach students how

54:07.040 --> 54:12.160
to do calculations of heat conduction temperature variations and so on in the context of a first

54:12.160 --> 54:18.560
course in thermodynamics and this is very cool because it's functional and it's active so what

54:18.560 --> 54:23.920
are the bees doing so they're essentially spreading themselves out or moving their legs out or moving

54:23.920 --> 54:28.480
their legs in and one can make some sense out of this so this is an example of if you want

54:28.480 --> 54:33.280
where temperature regulation is associated with changing the physicality the embodiment of how

54:33.280 --> 54:37.600
the collective essentially responds we're seeing the porosity is like the area

54:37.680 --> 54:43.360
that's the simplest measure or it has now gone on I think I've actually measured in fact using an

54:43.360 --> 54:48.640
x she's put the whole hive into a tomograph and she can essentially watch what is inside right

54:48.640 --> 54:52.080
now you can just see it's the same number of bees how do we know that we can measure the weight

54:52.080 --> 54:56.000
before and after and we can see that the same number of bees the volume is much larger therefore

54:56.000 --> 55:01.120
the porosity has increased and the density has decreased and therefore in the surface area right

55:01.120 --> 55:04.400
there has to be naturally a change in the surface area but the total number of bees kept is kept

55:04.400 --> 55:10.560
constant yeah okay there's mechanical adaptation so as I said you have to change you have to

55:10.560 --> 55:14.160
figure out how to maintain temperature you have to also figure out how to essentially respond

55:14.160 --> 55:19.440
to shocks mechanical shocks so if I put you inside an elevator and I start shaking you what would you

55:19.440 --> 55:24.560
do I mean I've shown you the result over there but what would you do individually okay move to

55:24.560 --> 55:29.120
the ground so that you can basically move and have your center of mass as low as possible or go to a

55:29.120 --> 55:35.280
wall this happens collectively as well okay so when I start shaking the cluster of bees they

55:35.280 --> 55:42.720
start spreading out okay so this is very interesting because this is a kind of mechanical if you want

55:44.080 --> 55:49.760
way of distributing the load because if the bees at the base have to take up all the load the bees

55:49.760 --> 55:54.160
at the tip don't have to take up any of the load at all and yet they do so so is this a mechanical

55:54.240 --> 56:00.320
altruism I don't know okay because all that's happening move all the bees to the to the surface

56:00.320 --> 56:07.760
and therefore the load on all of them reduces and they're much happier okay so you can you can make

56:07.760 --> 56:12.240
sense of this again using a theoretical model which I'm pretty sure Orit has talked to you about

56:13.200 --> 56:19.360
but fundamentally it's playing with a collective version of a set of pendula which can essentially

56:19.360 --> 56:24.240
oscillate from side to side we can also oscillate up and down so you have two degrees of freedom

56:24.240 --> 56:28.880
you have a whole collection of them and you can show that functionally load distribution is much

56:28.880 --> 56:35.680
much better and much more robust when you flatten out at high amplitudes or high frequencies and

56:35.680 --> 56:41.440
then there is a third problem so this is mechanical thermal regulation that's mechanical adaptation

56:41.440 --> 56:46.720
and and and then there is the hydrodynamics of ventilation so in the termite mound the mound

56:47.600 --> 56:50.960
is more or less fixed and the whole mound works as a lung

56:52.080 --> 56:59.040
in the bee box the bees can't question yeah what would be the trade-off between shaking

56:59.040 --> 57:06.640
very good between these two yeah I don't have an answer what we do find is that you can see

57:07.760 --> 57:14.000
over here the yeah why don't we can you ask me the question at the end I'll come back to that

57:14.000 --> 57:19.040
because it's a very difficult question associated with you know if I want to be mechanically stable

57:19.040 --> 57:24.240
and thermally relatively well insulated what kinds of shapes do you get I mean we have some thoughts

57:24.240 --> 57:30.000
on that but just can you hold on and ask me the question at the end okay so I want to contrast

57:30.000 --> 57:36.000
ventilation in the termite mound where the mound is fixed and temperature variations as a function

57:36.000 --> 57:42.400
of time are converted to spatial gradients which lead to flows in a bee box the bee box is fixed

57:42.400 --> 57:49.360
and a remarkable solution seems to present itself um on the solution so this is the bee box right

57:49.360 --> 57:53.360
here this is where the brood is now let me show you

57:59.600 --> 58:05.040
at the entrance fan okay question for you which way should you fan

58:05.360 --> 58:12.640
and where first which way and then where outwards or inwards

58:21.040 --> 58:23.040
why

58:26.640 --> 58:33.600
not only to remove the question or comment you say inwards good okay turns out that

58:33.600 --> 58:38.080
you want to actually pull air you want to you want to get outwards why because I can measure

58:38.080 --> 58:42.400
not only can I essentially ventilate but I can measure I can measure what is happening inside

58:42.400 --> 58:47.600
the hive or inside the bee box by pulling material by pulling the air out and now there are two

58:47.600 --> 58:54.800
solutions okay if I can pull air out I can do this by modulating in time that's how we do when we breathe

58:56.160 --> 59:01.520
same entrance and same exit we modulate in time okay I don't have to modulate in time alone I can

59:01.520 --> 59:08.560
modulate in space so it depends on the size of the orifice if I had a very wide mouth I can say

59:08.560 --> 59:13.120
at one part I essentially pull in and if I pull in at one part I can continuously pull in and the

59:13.120 --> 59:18.480
other part just by continuity you just move out and that's the second solution that we find so

59:18.480 --> 59:23.920
they always pull out and then they will spontaneously when they start out originally being homogeneous

59:23.920 --> 59:28.560
distributed they will end up on one boundary or the other so there's a transition there's an instability

59:28.640 --> 59:32.480
and that essentially drives the transition all the bees which are pulling out end up on one side

59:32.480 --> 59:36.880
and then they can continuously pull out and the advantage is when I'm measuring and I am

59:36.880 --> 59:42.480
ventilating now if I need more bees I just have to signal and so bees have a nason off gland they

59:42.480 --> 59:47.680
have essentially a whole set of pheromones associated with signaling so they push that signal out and

59:47.680 --> 59:52.560
the same wind which is essentially associated with pulling the air out now you can essentially

59:52.560 --> 59:57.600
advect you've probably all heard of stigmergy and in the context of stigmergy using diffusion

59:57.600 --> 01:00:01.440
to essentially signal now using flow which of course that means you're essentially improving

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.120
the efficiency enormously because instead of square root of time it's going linearly as time

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:10.400
and this is what bees do so they will first start pulling out then they will essentially end up on

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.120
one side and then finally they will essentially get other bees to join using this nason off

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:19.280
sensing mechanism and you can construct a mathematical framework for this you can do

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:26.640
experiments and so on okay I think I have run out of time so I am happy to stop here for anybody

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.720
and same thing in every one of these problems in the termite case in the all the bee cases

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.000
there was local sensing there's local actuation here it's heat transport here with mechanical

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
vibrations here it's fluid flow and heat transport and carbon dioxide all of these things

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:50.080
embodied or available to you I wouldn't even say embodied local sensing and actuation is

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.880
embodied the rest is there and and it's used repeatedly by these organisms so I will stop

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:06.000
by going to the last slide I had I think three slides four slides I'm going to go to the last slide

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:15.280
and happy to talk to people about ants if you want to stay I showed you some examples of how

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:22.800
large-scale problem solving can happen very very simply using local sensing and actuation

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.480
and critically it's mediated by physical fields which you cannot ignore because all this happened

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:35.920
in the world it didn't happen in some abstract brain or with a set of circuits alone second

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.520
thing this idea that you can separately study you know the living and non-living perhaps but

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:49.520
certainly in these social systems and super organisms I don't think so and I want to bring

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:55.440
to mind I think somebody who I'm sure is a great inspiration for people here as as as he has been

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:02.320
for me which is associated with the parable of the ant I think Herb Simon famously showed

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.800
an image of an ant showing some very very complicated path and without showing the

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.480
environment at all and the point that he wanted to make is that it looks like a very complicated

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.280
path because you've forgotten what the environment and as soon as you put the environment in

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.440
everything starts to essentially make itself much more clear and so rather than thinking

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:25.200
only about embodiment should we be extending it in order to account for the environment as well

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:34.080
well I showed you these examples Stigmergy's diffusive signaling flow is advective vibrations

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:41.120
is non-local just like flow I want to emphasize what I said before you can have what you might

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.880
think of as adaptable learnable solutions but you don't need representation you don't need plan

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.480
you don't need planner and you automatically get robustness because you've distributed a lot of

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.480
everything that you want to do into very simple local rules okay last point I want to come back

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.200
to where I started unfortunately I didn't have a chance to tell you about this but I am happy

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:09.040
to talk to people privately we've really started now asking questions of how hard or how easy it

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:14.800
is to do this from a synthetic perspective and not synthetic biology but if you want synthetic

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:21.200
engineering mathematical models of course are a way to synthesize systems but also physical

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:27.600
mimics and I'll close with a question which I think inspired a lot of people over here and

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.720
continues to inspire me you know just like Curing was thinking about intelligence can we think

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:39.280
about behavior the same way how much of what is happening can I essentially understand by

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:46.400
looking at collective behavior and if we can't then I think this quest of pushing towards ever

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:52.960
smaller mechanistic understanding of the molecular scale may be a lost cause you can only say what

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.960
is minimally needed you can perhaps say what is sufficient but beyond that it's very very hard to

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.600
say exactly all the different things all the different ways in which you can essentially come

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.560
up with a solution and that's of course not at all surprising because inverse problems are notoriously

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:14.320
ill-posed unless I have regularization unless I have mathematically or physically ways of

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.200
essentially saying these are the classes of solutions that I'm able to deal with I can't

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.240
really answer that question how do I deduce the rules by looking at the behavior for example if I'd

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.440
shown you you know these robots as individual particles could you tell me whether they were

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.960
actual robots whether they were termites and if you can't I think there's a real issue with asking

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.600
that kind of a question okay on that I will stop thank you so much I'm sorry I went over

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.240
gotta get out of here

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:58.320
so it's interesting this

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.560
What's in it, dude, is what's in it.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.280
So, physics for you is embodiment.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.280
So, right, so the non-local large space scales,

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.940
net scales are coming from physics.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:17.040
And whereas us, we get it from the whole body.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.640
We don't need the physics to do the work.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.480
Our body does the work.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.440
I'm just wondering.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.240
I would say that even for us, the environment is critical.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.760
Well, I'm not saying it's not critical,

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.280
but in this narrative, if you're that tiny termite,

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.000
the only way you get this on non-local information

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.360
is from the physics, right?

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.720
From these circulations.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.560
Whereas we can get it from long axons.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.920
I don't need physics to do the work.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.160
Well, I would say the long axons

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.920
are probably one of the physical solutions.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.200
But anyway, but keep going.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.600
Well, if that was, then you'd be inconsistent

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.120
in the way your narrative works

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.800
because that's a part of the organism, right?

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.200
You could say nerve conduction is physics or something,

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.920
but not useful conception physics seems to me.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.840
But I'm just wondering whether or not

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.320
there are sort of two worlds.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.360
There's the world of little things.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.040
And the only way they can build large structures

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.360
is by obtaining these non-local information

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.000
from physical principles.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.800
And there's an activity to go to us

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.520
where you just build large-scale biological structure,

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.400
which does the work, and physics becomes auxiliary.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:33.360
Let me, first of all, say that even for,

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.560
so for us, are you saying that

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.440
if I wanted to build something large,

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.280
I cannot do it using physics?

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.520
I cannot, but there are these two very different ways

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.640
of doing it.

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:48.640
Yeah, so let me frame this from an evolutionary point of view.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.880
So these organisms have been around

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.480
for 100 times longer than us,

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.260
for 350 million years.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.680
With relatively simple, I think, compared to us,

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.240
in going along exactly the direction

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.260
that you're going, cognitive rules,

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.260
and yet capable of solving these physiological tasks

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.720
which are common across the entire animal kingdom.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.720
If I have societies, I have to worry

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.080
about large-scale respiration, large-scale physiology,

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.000
locomotion, predation, pre-capture, and so on.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.800
In early evolution, this is a solution that came to be.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.400
As evolution moved on, and this is a question

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.600
to which I don't really have an answer

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.040
in the sense that I'm satisfied with.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.440
I mean, there are a lot of words,

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.440
but I don't know how to convert that

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.600
into anything more quantitative.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.880
Can you have a notion of assimilation?

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.560
That is to say, you take these physics-based rules

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.040
which are part of the environment,

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.600
and then you build them into the body.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.640
When I build them into the body,

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.640
I have the ability to move by essentially coordination.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.400
That was previously, this bee talked to that bee,

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.360
which talked to that bee, and they all moved together.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.840
But now I say, no, let me just make a super bee,

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.000
and I connect them all together.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.640
Now they become part of the organism, super organism.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.080
So I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.400
I don't see a temporal path which tells you how to start here,

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.400
because these have been around, as I said,

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.240
for a hundred times longer than us.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.360
They're multicellular.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.400
They solve, by the way, the same kind of problems

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.160
that we solve on the organismal level.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.520
I didn't talk about the physiology of respiration.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.800
In insect respiration, it's very different from our respiration.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.440
Small insects don't need lungs.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.240
They don't need lungs because they can essentially

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.000
interact directly with the environment through spiracles,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.160
which means diffusive transport is good enough.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.520
You become big, you have to change your rules.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.560
So I'm not disagreeing at all with you.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.160
I guess my concern is, is it really a discrete setting,

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.440
because I sort of think of this as a whole spectrum of solutions?

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.960
Let's imagine, if the termite might now and now say,

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.880
right, and you just stomp the bout

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.280
and move around in the environment, right?

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.640
At that point, these principles are kind of useless,

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.080
because that degree of integration is not going to be achieved

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.480
by advection and diffusion anymore.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.520
That's why we have neuron, long neurons, right?

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.240
So in other words, there really is a distinction

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.400
that comes in once you have these more structured interactions.

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.120
So I would say that transition is not as discrete

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.680
as I think what I'm hearing you say.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.920
This is a distributed solution.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.800
If I don't know whether you're saying

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.080
that you also have possibilities for centralized solutions,

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.920
centralized brains, if you're not saying that,

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.840
then I think we don't disagree.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.200
But if you are, then I would say I'm not sure that I agree.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.000
Oh, it's not central, but...

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.040
Because you can think about cephalopods, yeah.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.320
Central, I'm not using that central.

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.000
Just this idea that, anyway,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.760
but this idea that advection and diffusion,

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.840
we don't have a nervous system that does its work.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.280
I don't do vision by advection and diffusion.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.560
Oh, I didn't talk only about advection and diffusion.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.320
I talked about there are all kinds of other things

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.680
that are mechanical, there's movement,

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.920
there's all kinds of other things as well.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.720
I mean, I gave you a couple of examples

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.880
where you can have active movement,

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.480
which can essentially solve problems in morphogenesis.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.760
And if you ask me questions about vision,

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.720
I mean, understanding how the orientation

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.080
dominance columns arise,

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.320
actually it is advection and diffusion

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.120
coupled with stimuli,

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.400
which lead to ocular dominance columns arising.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.560
We can have...

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.480
Dominance columns arrive through a strict connectivity

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.440
of neurons through reciprocal advection.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.520
That's how ocular dominance columns arrive.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.560
There is an underlying connectivity that gives...

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.080
Yeah, but how do you get the connectivity in the first place?

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:46.920
No, it's fair enough.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.760
That's different.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.840
I mean, no, but that's part of...

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.720
You can't put the connectivity in.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.320
You've got to get the connectivity out.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.320
We should continue to see that.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.600
Okay, thank you.
