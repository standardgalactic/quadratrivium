0	5240	I'm Jessica Flack and I'm the co-director of the Center for Complexity and Collective
5240	7800	Computation in the WID.
7800	12840	And before I introduce tonight's topic and speakers, special guests, I would like to
12840	16160	first thank some of the folks in WID who made tonight happen.
16160	22800	Maria Piat, Marianne Englisch, Jenny Eagleton, Sarah Shapiro, and Beth Misko, WID's outstanding
22800	25440	administrative and outreach team.
25440	29600	I'd also like to thank Wisconsin Public Television, who's in the back filming the lectures
29600	36360	tonight, everybody at University Communications, who's done a great job with advertising, folks
36360	42280	at the ITHMIS for accommodating changes the last minute, and of course the IT team and
42280	46160	Alan Ruby in particular here in WID for their support tonight.
46160	49760	And finally, the Center for Complexity and Collective Computation is indebted to John
49760	56160	Wiley and to the Templeton Foundation for very much appreciated financial support of
56160	58260	tonight's lecture series.
58260	61900	Without this support, we could not have these kinds of events.
61900	65620	So tonight's lecture on the roles of energy and information in 21st century biology is
65620	70620	part of a new public lecture series sponsored by C4, that's the Center for Complexity and
70620	74900	Collective Computation, and the series is called the John von Neumann Public Lectures
74900	76940	in Complexity and Computation.
76940	82380	And the lectures are going to be each month at about 7 p.m. the 2nd or 3rd Wednesday over
82380	86920	the course of the fall and spring semesters in 2012 and 2013.
86920	90000	We have a great lineup this fall.
90000	95280	The next speaker, the next lecture is on October 17th, and it's by Graham Spencer, who you
95280	101400	might know as one of the original founders of Excite, and he's currently a partner at
101400	106160	Google Ventures, and he's going to be talking about programming the Internet.
106160	110360	He's a super smart, broad-minded computer scientist who gives fun and insightful lectures,
110360	112960	so I hope to see you guys all there.
112960	117440	Intelligent information are two of the most fundamental concepts in science, affecting
117440	122600	phenomena over a vast range of scales, from quantum mechanics to the origin of life to
122600	128840	the evolution of cooperation in human and animal societies, to also, as you'll hear
128840	131760	about tonight, the size and pace of cities.
131760	135280	In tonight's lecture, Dr. Jeffrey West and Dr. David Krakauer, who I will introduce
135280	139680	momentarily, will explore how information and energy have shaped nature, and they'll
139680	145040	discuss the implications of the principles for the future of science, for future of biology,
145040	147880	and for society.
147880	151720	Some of the questions that we will tackle over the course of the evening tonight include
151720	154920	what really are energy and information.
154920	158840	The laws of physics, and specifically the first law of thermodynamics, tells us that
158840	162080	energy cannot be created or destroyed.
162080	168800	As such, it's said to be a conserved quantity, meaning that the total energy in the universe
168800	171240	is a constant.
171240	175240	It is this property of energy coupled to the fact that it can be hard to transform into
175240	179960	something useful that makes it seem like a finite expendable resource.
179960	182280	Now is the same true for information?
182280	184920	Or can information be created and destroyed?
184920	187360	And if so, what does this mean?
187360	191800	So as you'll hear tonight, existing theories of information stress that information increases
191800	194560	our understanding of the world around us.
194560	201640	In formal terms, we say that information reduces the uncertainty about the environment.
201640	205760	But there's nothing in this definition that captures, I think, the fact that most of us,
205760	209560	for most of us in this audience, information is really about meaning.
209560	213280	It's the knowledge itself not about reducing uncertainty about the knowledge that we're
213280	214920	interested in.
214920	217960	So existing formal theories of information have nothing to say about this which you might
217960	218960	call semantics.
218960	222320	Do we need a new theory of information?
222320	223960	That includes meaning or semantics.
223960	226720	That's one of the questions we'll ask tonight.
226720	230400	Can we use existing formal theories of information?
230400	234760	Or are the new ones that we might build to overcome energetic constraints?
234760	240160	Or does information only help us find solutions to harness energy more efficiently?
240160	244360	These are deep and unanswered questions in physics and biology.
244360	249360	So finally, we are going to ask what would a new science of energy and information mean
249360	253720	for physics, for computer science, for biology, and for society?
253720	255760	So our first speaker is Dr. Jeffrey West.
255760	259720	Jeffrey is a theoretical physicist whose primary interests have been in fundamental questions
259720	264480	in physics, especially those concerning the elementary particles, their interactions
264480	267720	and cosmological implications.
267720	273520	Jeffrey received his BA from Cambridge in 1961, his doctorate from Stanford in 1966,
273520	276840	where he returned in 1970 as a member of the faculty.
276840	282560	He was the leader and founder of the high-energy physics group at Los Alamos National Labs.
282560	285800	Then he moved to the Santa Fe Institute in 2003, where he became a distinguished member
285800	293160	of the faculty and eventually became president of SFI for 2005 to 2009.
293160	297480	His long-term fascination has been in the origin of universal scaling laws that pervade
297480	302040	biology from the molecular genomic scale up through a minor country and sells to whole
302040	304360	organisms and ecosystems.
304360	307640	He's currently working to extend the theory of scaling that was developed in biology,
307640	312080	or as it was developed in biology, to social systems with the goal of understanding the
312080	317280	structure and dynamic of social organizations, such as cities and corporations.
317280	322600	Tonight, he will talk on energy scaling and the future of life on Earth for about 45
322600	323760	minutes.
323760	326360	Our second lecture is David Krakauer.
326360	330280	David is the director of the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, co-director of the Center for
330280	334960	Complexity and Collective Computation, professor of genetics at UW-Madison and external professor
334960	337200	at the Santa Fe Institute.
337200	340800	A graduate of University London and Oxford University has authored more than a hundred
340800	345040	scientific papers, served on several journal editorial boards, and works to bridge the
345040	349920	gap between academia and business, and also between the physical and biological sciences
349920	354520	on the one hand and the social sciences and humanities on the other.
354520	358880	His research focuses on the evolutionary history of information processing mechanisms
358880	361280	in adaptive systems.
361280	365920	But his mind, and I know him well, is perhaps best described as sitting in an intellectual
365920	369960	space that has been deeply influenced by, I guess, I think a somewhat idiosyncratic
369960	375800	group of some of history's most interesting contributors, including John Louis Borges,
375800	379720	John von Neumann, Turing, Bill Hamilton, and Sir Thomas Brown.
379720	384240	Tonight he will talk for 30 minutes on the power of information to transform the 21st
384240	386000	century.
386000	390040	Following the lectures of David and Jeffrey, Steve Paulson from Wisconsin Public Radio
390040	395080	will lead a panel discussion on the role of energy and information in 21st century biology.
395080	399000	Steve is the executive producer and interviewer with, to the best of our knowledge, a well
399000	401040	known science radio program.
401040	407080	Paulson is written for Salon, Slate, The Huffington Post, The Chronicle of Higher Education,
407080	409800	The Independent, and many other publications.
409800	415200	His radio reports have also been broadcast on NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered.
415200	419320	His recent book, Adams and Eden, Conversations on Religion and Science, was published back
419320	421520	for the University Press.
421560	426080	So please join me for a bit of a marathon session and welcome Steve, David, and Jeffrey.
426080	428080	Thank you.
451520	457080	Thank you, David, thank you, Jessica, and thank you for inviting me to give this talk
457080	465040	and be part of this interesting discussion about energy and information.
465040	474880	So this is the title that was given to me, mostly because I was delinquent in giving
474880	477840	one myself.
477840	483480	And it does sort of cover what I'm going to talk about, but this is kind of the landscape
483480	490480	that I'm going to be talking about tonight in terms primarily of energy and the ideas
490480	497440	surrounding metabolism in biology, and it's a very idiosyncratic view, and as is clear
497440	504120	from the introduction, I come to it as a theoretical physicist wandering into areas of biology
504120	506480	and the social sciences.
506480	508160	And I'm going to begin it.
508160	513960	I'm going to take as a point of departure something that's relevant to this, namely,
513960	520720	this is supported by the Center for Computation and Complexity, or whatever anyway.
520720	529200	Complexity was in it, and I wanted to use as a point of departure a statement by Stephen
529200	534080	Hawking, who is not someone that works on complexity and not someone that works on biology, but
534080	541640	is a highly reductionistic physicist, and here's something he said about 10 years ago.
541640	544960	Some say that while the 20th century was the century of physics, we are now entering the
544960	546360	century of biology.
546360	547840	What do you think of this?
547840	552160	And many people believe the 21st century is the century of biology, and it certainly will
552160	557440	be, but more importantly, and this I do believe is what Hawking says, I think the next century
557440	561560	will be the century of complexity, because many of the problems we're going to face
561560	566880	and are facing are to do with complex adaptive systems, and I'll be talking a little bit
566880	568040	about them.
568040	573680	And I want to use this, as I say, as a point of departure because implicit in this is an
573680	580160	idea of what complexity is, and that's something I'm not going to discuss, but accept to use
580160	586920	it to talk about what is not complex first, because it brings in the whole role of energy.
586920	591360	And this is a system we're familiar with, the solar system, and this is a system that
591360	594040	is often thought of as not complex.
594040	603160	It is simple, and by simple it means that the whole dynamics of that system, the motion
603160	608400	of the planets around the sun and therefore of the satellites that power our communication
608400	614120	systems, are all encoded in two very simple looking equations.
614120	618560	This is a highly non-technical talk, you don't have to understand the equations, everybody
618560	624480	is familiar with the idea F equals MA, but they're in the two laws proposed by Newton
624480	628880	that kind of covers everything to do with the motion of the solar system, the planets
628880	634680	around the sun, but much, much else, and much of modern physics is based on these equations
634680	640200	or versions of these equations, but critical in this is the flow of energy, the idea that
640200	646960	energy is the kind of fundamental thing that's underlying this motion, and one of the crucial
646960	651440	aspects of that is already been mentioned by Jessica, the conservation of energy.
651440	655920	But if you add to it another set of equations, which you don't have to understand, but important
655920	661440	to understand conceptually the equations of Maxwell for unifying electricity and magnetism
661440	666960	and giving rise to understanding radiation, electromagnetic radiation, that pretty much
666960	673080	encompasses much of the kind of world that we live in, and indeed, just to take these
673080	678360	two equations with these equations is how your cell phone works and allows everybody
678360	683680	to communicate and everything else that's pretty much around us, and these, the word
683680	690360	simple applies to because they invoke the idea that you can encode everything in this symbolic
690360	696480	fashion and from that everything else follows, even down to the quantum level, and one of
696480	701640	the things I want to emphasize is that again, these are to do with the flow of energy and
701640	707160	because they are simple and they are written in a mathematically precise form, you can
707160	712080	calculate things somehow in principle to any degree of accuracy, and one of the great
712080	718960	triumphs of 20th century science is this calculation, which is calculating the strength
718960	724560	of the magnet associated with the electron, and here's the theory to 12 decimal places,
724560	727920	and here's the experiment agreeing with it to 12 decimal places.
727920	733760	This is kind of extraordinary, and this is quite unusual actually in the world that we
733760	740480	live in, because the world that we live in, oh, I forgot about that, I put this slide
740480	746040	in, just to show you some of the main characters that you're familiar with that have, that
746040	750080	I think have played an important role in developing ideas of energy.
750080	755120	One is this, is Newton, that's the kind of rock star image of Newton.
755120	760440	This is Einstein looking like Einstein, and this is Max Planck, the origin of photons
760440	770520	and the quantum, and this is someone, oops, this is someone that most people are not familiar
770520	777520	with, it's another, there was a famous Bill Hamilton here, biologist, very famous ecologist,
777520	781640	biologist, the David or Jessica actually mentioned.
781640	789520	This is a really deep Bill Hamilton, this is Bill Hamilton, he was an Irishman who I
789520	796560	sadly drank himself to death, but he encoded something extremely important about energy,
796560	801200	and the physicists in the audience will forgive me, but basically he said that all physical
801200	807560	systems in some sense minimize the amount of energy that needs to be expended.
807560	813000	So this kind of a least, minimum least energy principle, Hamilton's principle, it's actually
813000	818440	called technically the principle of least action, but roughly speaking this is the framework
818440	825440	in which all of the physics that encompasses everything from the macroscopic down to string
825440	832400	theory operates from, is using those principles, and it's to do based on energy.
832400	838200	So here's a picture of energy, this is energy, we're familiar with it, and this is highly
838200	842600	complex use of energy because these are highly non-linear effects and you're familiar with
842600	849640	them, you're also familiar with this, this is the energy that we create on the planet
849640	856080	through objects like this, cities, and I'm going to talk a little bit about that shortly,
856080	863280	and these are driven of course by us, which involve energy, so there are these multiple
863280	873160	levels of energy, and they go all the way down to the thing that drives these us, that
873160	880720	drives us to create the light and the energy by which we live, our brains and our cells,
880720	887360	and these of course also operate by energy themselves, but they invoke something new
887360	893360	that is typically not been considered in physics, and they invoke information, the idea that
893360	900960	information necessarily is needed to be put into the system in order to understand the
900960	905840	way these systems have evolved and the way they organize and the way they behave, and
905840	911520	these systems are typically outside physics, and they form much of the work of biology
911520	919440	and the social sciences, and they are complex, but more importantly they evolve and are therefore
919440	925800	adaptive, so these are very different in their nature from the kind of simplistic system that
925880	932640	we see in the motions of the planets, or even may I say in thinking about string theory
932640	937600	as the origins of the universe, because we can write definitive, precise equations in
937600	944280	principle for those, whereas for these we have this extraordinary challenging problem
944280	950120	of both integrating information in it and understanding the role of energy, and what
950120	956320	I'm going to explore tonight is how far one can take the traditional physics thinking
956320	964480	without invoking explicitly information to understand some of the organization and dynamics
964480	969560	of these systems, and then David will talk about information and maybe in the discussion
969560	973880	we'll talk a little bit about the integration. So here's another kind of system that you're
973880	980360	familiar with, a forest, and all of these systems obey second law of thermodynamics and
980360	985680	the conservation of energy, and therefore the production of entropy, which is the kind
985680	993120	of random stuff, the dissipative kind of energy that comes from doing work and creating order,
993120	999560	it is the resulting disorder that comes from ordering the system, and one of the challenges
999640	1005760	and I would say, I would even go as far as to say, I think the major challenge conceptually
1005760	1011280	in 21st century science is understanding this integration between energy and resources on
1011280	1018680	the one hand, metabolism in biology with information, genomics maybe, and integrate and get a complete
1018680	1025440	understanding of these. These are typically considered separately, roughly speaking, in
1026040	1033360	the kind of academic way in which we think about these things. So what I'm going to talk
1033360	1040600	about in these systems is, as a physicist, I want a quantitative, predictive, mathematical
1040600	1045920	in principle understanding of the dynamics and organization of these systems, and it
1045920	1052000	is clear for the kinds of systems I just referred to, we cannot do what we did for understanding
1052000	1057080	the magnetic moment of the electron. We're not going to get equations that produce precise
1057080	1066080	calculations, but maybe what we can get is what we call coarse grain descriptions. So
1066080	1071720	for example, the kinds of questions that we ought to be able to answer quantitatively
1071720	1076480	are questions like this. Why is it that I can look across this room and say, everybody
1076480	1085160	will be dead in 100 years? In fact, if I look more closely, I would say that, including
1085160	1092160	myself, may I say, but where does 100 years come from for a typical lifespan of a human
1092160	1099440	being? Why isn't it 10 years or 1,000 years? And how is that connected to underlying molecular
1099440	1102920	structures of the genome and the respiratory complex? Where in the hell does that come
1102960	1108800	from? And why is it that the same stuff, if it were a mouse, only lives two or three
1108800	1115160	years? So those are the kinds of coarse-grained questions that one ought to be able to answer
1115160	1122240	in a predictive framework, and I'm not going to talk much about these, but in what role
1122240	1127080	does energy and metabolism play in these? So here's another set of similar kinds of
1127080	1131720	coarse-grained questions. Why do we need eight hours of sleep? Why do we need to sleep? Why
1131840	1138040	are not two hours or 18 hours like a mouse or four hours like an elephant? Where in the
1138040	1144280	hell do these numbers come from? And why is it that mice get many more tumors during their
1144280	1150200	lifespan per unit volume than human beings? And therefore, why in the hell are we doing
1150200	1155360	all these experiments on mice and trying to draw conclusions about human beings? We need
1155360	1160960	to understand those kinds of questions. And the one I really love is why is it very good
1161040	1166240	to grow babies in your body but not grow cancer, which is also part of you? So these are kind
1166240	1171640	of coarse-grained questions. And one that has occupied me in the last few years is are citizen
1171640	1179640	companies just large organisms that are biological? Are citizen organisms just, is New York a great
1179640	1186960	big whale? And Google a great big elephant? And if that's true, how come that organisms
1187040	1196040	die? Companies die but cities don't. And in fact, I would say, roughly speaking, almost
1196040	1201520	no cities die, although you can think of counter examples. We have done awful experiments to
1201520	1207520	test that. We've dropped two atom bombs on two cities and 30 years later they're functioning.
1207520	1214120	Companies, all companies die. And so one of the questions is in a coarse-grained way, can
1214160	1220160	we predict when Google and Microsoft are going to go bust? Because they surely will eventually.
1220160	1224480	Okay, so those are the kinds of questions. And I want to lead into all of this. This is
1224480	1231480	biology, but I want to lead into it via cities because we are facing an extraordinary challenge
1232480	1238320	and this is addressing the question of how biological are cities and can we understand
1238320	1243920	them that way? We are facing this extraordinary challenge that we live in this exponentially
1243920	1249480	expanding universe of socioeconomic quantities. And just to give you an example, we've gone
1249480	1254640	from a few percent being urban to over 80 percent being urban in just 200 years. The
1254640	1259960	world's across the halfway mark. We're going to go to somewhere close to 80 percent by
1259960	1266800	2050. China's building several hundred new cities in the next 20 to 30 years. And indeed,
1266800	1272800	this statistic ought to freak everybody out that every week from now to 2050 on the average
1272840	1277240	one and a half million people are being urbanized. Therefore, every two months, there's a New
1277240	1282240	York metropolitan area coming onto this planet. So by the beginning of December, there's another
1282240	1287440	New York metropolitan area. By the beginning of February, there's another one. By the beginning
1287440	1294440	of April, there's another one and so on inextricably for the next 30, 40 years. Now, can I use
1295720	1297240	explosives in this talk?
1297240	1298240	Sure.
1298240	1303760	Okay. How in the f*** are we going to deal with that? This is an extraordinary challenge.
1303760	1310760	So I want to get into that and it is related to energy. Okay. So the other aspect to recognize
1312120	1317360	is that all of the tsunami of problems we're facing from global warming to the environment
1317360	1324360	to health problems to crime to resource problems, water, energy and so on, all are driven by
1325360	1331360	urbanization by people in cities. So that's the problem. But cities are also the solution
1331360	1338360	because they suck all of you lot into Madison. Cities suck in people and they are the sources
1338360	1345360	of ideas, innovation and wealth creation. So this is what cities are represented by,
1346360	1352360	the good of cities. This is what in fact attracts people to cities, all these good things, culture,
1353360	1360360	music, goods and so on, driven and participating in an ever expanding, exponential, expanding
1361080	1368080	economy. But if this is a thermodynamic system, which it is, it produces entropy. So it produces
1369800	1376800	socioeconomic entropy. Incidentally, side comment, if you look in any of the standard
1377800	1384800	economics books, you never see the word entropy. But what is more amazing is, we've looked
1386080	1393080	in five of the standard texts, only in one did the word energy appear. That's a side
1393600	1400600	comment, provocative comment. So here's socioeconomic entropy. Okay. You're familiar with all this.
1401600	1406600	And the question is, is that what New York and San Francisco and it looked like in 2050
1406600	1413600	or that, or like this, or this? This is what we want, or even like that, beautiful, or
1415400	1421760	like that in a hundred years or that. And most importantly, to maintain that, which
1421760	1428520	is the social buzz of a city, the interaction of people. So here's the question, given this
1428560	1435560	extraordinary role of cities, we need a science of cities. Okay. And I'm going to use energy
1435960	1441720	as the as a major piece of that. So the question is, can we have a science of that? And is
1441720	1447760	that another version of this? Well, if it is, that would be good, actually. If this were
1447760	1454760	another version of that, because you ask any question that has a quantitative metric associated
1455240	1459680	with it, like, how many trees are there of a given size? How many leaves are there in
1459680	1465000	a given branch of a given size? How much energy is flowing through each one? How many, how
1465000	1471000	big is the canopy? What is the mortality rate? What is the growth rate? How, how far apart
1471000	1476880	the trees have given size, etc. All those can be answered in a quantitative conceptual
1476880	1482800	framework with a bunch of mathematical formulae, which in a coarse grained way, agrees with
1482840	1488000	data from forests all across the globe. And the question is, can we do the same for this?
1488000	1495000	Sorry, we'll submit to go backwards. So we're here, some of the commonalities, metaphorically,
1496160	1502520	at least, between social organizations and biological organisms, which we're all familiar
1502520	1509520	with. And I'm going to show you some just very briefly some data that substantiates
1510280	1516720	the idea that we understand a little bit about, generically, the way forests work. So what
1516720	1522080	this is, is just a plot of the number of trees of a given size. The theory, which I'm going
1522080	1527320	to talk about momentarily, the theory predicts that it goes as the inverse square of the
1527320	1530920	diameter of the tree trunks. The number of trees of a given size goes as the inverse
1530920	1534640	square of the diameter of the tree trunks, which means if you look at trees that are
1534640	1539200	twice the size of any others, there's a quarter of the number, two squared, a quarter of the
1539200	1545000	number, if it were three times, it'd be eighth and so on. So you get the idea. And there's
1545000	1549680	data. And what is important about it, not only does the data fit the theory, but you
1549680	1556680	can see it's over a period of 30, 40 years, this forest, which is a tropical forest, has
1556920	1563680	changed dramatically. Lots of trees have died, new ones have grown, rapid turnover. But this
1563680	1570680	law has remained robust. And there's data into the 90s and 2000s that continue with
1572360	1578480	that. I'm going to miss this. So here's the kind of framework that I want to invoke. Here's
1578480	1584280	a cartoon of, say, an ecosystem. I could have done a city. And this is the lens that I want
1584280	1589840	to look at it through. And all of these equations actually are really to do with energy flow.
1590840	1595960	So another concept I want to talk about very briefly is the concept of scalability that
1595960	1602960	a system needs to be scalable if it is a system that is going to be resilient and evolvable
1603880	1610160	and adaptive to change. It needs to be scalable just in the sense that we are scalable. This
1610160	1617160	is us. We have scaled over a range of 100 million in size in mass. We go down to something
1619920	1624760	that sits on the palm of my hand all the way up to something that's bigger than this, much
1624760	1631280	bigger than this room. And we're all pretty much the same thing. We may look different,
1631280	1638280	but in terms of, in a coarse-grained average way in terms of our life history and our physiology,
1638280	1643320	we're all pretty much the same thing. And I'm going to show you that in a moment. But
1643320	1649160	even going further, in going from the molecular levels, I could have put the genome here.
1649640	1654720	This is what the cartoon of the molecules that produce your energy all the way through
1654720	1661320	mitochondria to cells, to multicellular organisms like this, to produce things like this, houses
1661320	1667280	and produce things like this, so that, in fact, what goes on here scales all the way
1667280	1674280	through this to keep this going. All of these have to be scalable because they are highly
1674280	1680520	complex and high and continuously evolving and continuously adapting. And so there has
1680520	1686520	to be a kind of scalability. And out of that comes the idea that you can't have this being
1686520	1693520	arbitrary. There have to be emergent laws that govern this. And I think the next slide,
1693520	1700280	ah, yes. So in a similar way to the way we scaled in a much shorter time frame in terms
1700280	1705520	of our growth, and one of the things that I will talk about briefly in a moment is about
1705520	1712100	growth and the fact that the same theory, the same theoretical framework, which I will
1712100	1720040	come to in a moment, which ah, it purports to explain the organization dynamics growth
1720040	1727320	of forests that I talked about earlier applied to us, mammals, gives rise to equations like
1727320	1732320	this or pictures like this for what is called a growth curve.
1732320	1734240	This is the weight as a function of age.
1734240	1735000	This is us.
1735000	1737440	It happens to be a rat version of us.
1737440	1740440	And the line there, the solid line,
1740440	1742880	is a prediction from the theory.
1742880	1744680	And the points are the data.
1744680	1745760	And you can see it's very good.
1745760	1747800	And this can be done for any organism.
1747800	1749680	And if I had time, I would show you
1749680	1751480	lots of other wonderful fits.
1751480	1753800	But the point is that we can understand growth.
1753800	1756440	And I will come to that in a moment.
1756440	1759920	But the important thing I want to stress now,
1759920	1764600	moving to social systems, is that this
1764600	1767960	were taken over to socioeconomic systems,
1767960	1772520	namely that the organism grows quickly and then stops,
1772520	1773240	like we did.
1773240	1776840	I mean, one of the amazing things about biology
1776840	1780680	is that we eat, we grow, and then we go on eating,
1780680	1781920	but we don't grow.
1781920	1783160	And the theory explains that.
1783160	1784640	And I don't have time to go into it.
1784640	1786120	Maybe we can discuss it later.
1786160	1789040	And it's all to do with the input of energy
1789040	1791800	and the distribution of energy and the scaling
1791800	1794120	of the networks that are inside us.
1794120	1797320	But the point is this would be very bad
1797320	1799000	if it were a socioeconomic system,
1799000	1802240	because this is our image of socioeconomic systems.
1802240	1805720	And I showed you a picture before of the economy,
1805720	1808080	always open and expanding.
1808080	1811400	And I want to come back to this in a moment.
1811400	1815920	So here's a picture of the extraordinary scaling
1815920	1817360	in biology.
1817360	1819200	So let me spend a minute on it.
1819200	1822160	What you see is plotted here is the most fundamental quantity,
1822160	1825360	certainly from a physicist's view, of in biology.
1825360	1826920	That is your metabolic rate.
1826920	1831600	How much energy do you need per day to stay alive?
1831600	1836400	The 2,000 food calories a day that you eat to stay alive.
1836400	1841960	And here it is plotted on the vertical axis
1841960	1845840	against the weight, the mass of the organism,
1845840	1847320	on the horizontal axis.
1847320	1850080	And it's plotted in a Byzantine way.
1850080	1852920	So I can put mice and elephants on the same graph.
1852920	1856280	And the Byzantine way is that instead of being linear,
1856280	1861280	it goes up by factors of 10, 1, 10, 100, 1,000 watts,
1861280	1863960	1, 10, 100, 1,000 kilograms.
1863960	1865640	So we can get everywhere on the same graph.
1865640	1868240	And what you see is something extraordinary,
1868240	1872360	that there's an extraordinary regularity
1872360	1875200	when we're dealing with maybe one of the most complex
1875200	1878120	and diverse phenomena in the universe.
1878120	1881320	Something unbelievably simple, ridiculously simple
1881320	1882280	has emerged.
1882280	1884920	And this is at some level astonishing
1884920	1888440	because we believe that each one of these organisms,
1888440	1892200	each subsystem of that organism, each organ, each cell
1892200	1896200	type, each genome has evolved with its own unique history
1896200	1899280	and its own unique environmental niche.
1899280	1902320	So you might have expected from that natural selection
1902320	1905560	viewpoint that if I plotted anything
1905560	1907160	versus the size of an organism, it'd
1907160	1910280	be all over the map representing, manifesting
1910280	1913440	the historical contingency involved in all of this.
1913440	1915120	No, that's not what you see.
1915120	1921080	You see something ridiculously, ridiculously regular.
1921080	1925480	And that regularity has some extraordinary features.
1925480	1931360	For one, the slope of it is approximately 3 quarters.
1931360	1933400	And that 3 quarters is less than one.
1933400	1937120	One would be a slope, a line like this.
1937120	1938800	And one is what you might naively
1938800	1941880	expect if you thought everything were pretty much the same.
1941880	1944520	The most naive level, you double the size of an organism,
1944520	1945560	double the number of cells.
1945560	1947440	Therefore, double the amount of energy needed
1947440	1948800	to keep it alive.
1948800	1949680	That's not what you see.
1949680	1951800	You see something less than one, which
1951800	1955000	means in that language, double the size of an organism.
1955000	1958000	Approximately instead of needing twice the amount of energy,
1958000	1960840	you only need roughly 75%.
1960840	1963440	So there's this extraordinary economy of scale
1963440	1967120	as you get bigger, and this is called sublinear behavior.
1967120	1973400	So it turns out that if you look at any physiological variable
1973400	1977280	that you can measure and or any life history event
1977280	1980520	that you can think of, it all has this kind of character.
1980520	1983240	And I'm going to show you a couple of examples.
1983240	1986240	There's heart rate, very mundane kind of quantity,
1986240	1987240	versus body size.
1987240	1988760	I'm not going to explain it in detail,
1988760	1993680	but what you see is, again, a very simple scaling law.
1993680	1995560	This is you thinking.
1995560	1998640	This is your white matter to gray matter in your brain.
1998640	2001480	Again, a very simple law evolving.
2001480	2003160	This is your genomes.
2003160	2006400	And what you see from this is that you
2006400	2009200	have this regular behavior, and the other remarkable thing
2009200	2012120	is all the slopes of those, like that three quarters,
2012120	2014840	are simple multiples of one quarter.
2014840	2019800	Four plays this amazing role in these scaling laws
2019800	2023000	of extraordinary complex phenomena.
2023000	2024160	What is underlying them?
2024160	2027720	And this is work I did with colleagues at the Santa Fe
2027720	2030160	Institute, and I'll tell you who they are in a moment.
2030160	2032160	The idea is, how in the hell can this
2032160	2038200	be that all of these phenomena have simple scaling laws?
2038200	2040480	And why is it that the scaling laws of mammals
2040480	2044920	are the same as birds, fish, crustacea, insects, and so on?
2044920	2045880	How can that be?
2045880	2048280	Well, what could be universal among them?
2048280	2050520	What could be universal is somehow
2050520	2054240	the supply of energy and resources through networks
2054240	2056280	has to be a commonality among them.
2056280	2060880	And the idea here was that it is the mathematics,
2060880	2065560	the universal mathematics, and geometric topological properties
2065560	2069320	of those networks that transcend design,
2069320	2071840	that are constraining natural selection.
2071840	2073120	That's the idea.
2073120	2076040	And I'm not going to, I don't have time to go into that,
2076040	2080560	other than to say that if you look at these networks,
2080560	2082960	that's your brain, that's your white-to-gray matter
2082960	2085640	of the brain, that's your lungs, that's a tree,
2085640	2088000	that's a little thing, lives inside an elephant,
2088000	2089520	but they're ubiquitous.
2089520	2092520	And they have these repositories.
2092520	2093760	They have these properties.
2093760	2095400	And if you use those properties, put them
2095400	2099520	into some fancy mathematics, and use Bill Hamilton's
2099520	2104960	principle of energy least action kind of ideas,
2104960	2107960	out-pop all of these marvelous scaling laws,
2107960	2110240	including the number four, the one quarter, which
2110240	2113040	happens to be, for the information, the dimension
2113040	2115080	that we live in, three plus one.
2115080	2117080	And just to add to that, the plus one
2117080	2120160	is to do with the fact that these networks have
2120160	2121520	a fractal-like behavior.
2121520	2124200	That's a kind of tangential remark.
2124200	2125200	So here's others.
2125200	2127800	This is down at the intracellular level.
2127800	2130400	This is the intermiticondrial level, and so on.
2130400	2131920	So here's that growth again.
2131920	2134320	So the idea is we have this theory.
2134320	2136360	The claim is we have this wonderful theory
2136360	2140200	that, based on networks, the mathematics of networks,
2140200	2143720	and that from that, we can understand these scaling laws.
2143720	2146080	But also, if you like, we understand the network.
2146080	2148640	We can understand the structure of the network
2148640	2151240	within each of the organisms.
2151240	2154360	And you can use that to go back to this growth
2154360	2158560	and use this kind of idea that, if you eat, you metabolize,
2158560	2163040	that energy goes through the network, controls the network,
2163040	2165760	which maintains the cells that are there,
2165760	2168720	replaces ones that are dead, and grows new ones.
2168720	2171240	And then from that, you can mathematics it,
2171240	2173840	and that gives rise to this equation, which
2173840	2177040	actually invokes all of the properties of the network
2177040	2181560	and gives rise to these kinds of what we call sigmoidal,
2181560	2185560	meaning they stop growing curves.
2185560	2189200	So here's kind of the summary of this part.
2189200	2192920	We have these amazing nonlinear quarter power scaling laws.
2192920	2196360	They represent an economy of scale.
2196360	2199200	The one quarter is intimately related
2199200	2202600	to flows of energy in networks.
2202600	2205360	One thing I did not emphasize is the pace of life
2205360	2209720	systematically slows with size, so that, for example, heart
2209720	2211920	rates decrease systematically according
2211920	2214440	to these quarter power scaling laws.
2214440	2218600	The rate of diffusion of oxygen, say, across membranes,
2218600	2220440	decreases with size.
2220440	2222800	Organisms live longer systematically,
2222800	2223760	and so on and so forth.
2223760	2227960	Everything to do with time slows down the bigger you are.
2227960	2231600	Growth is sigmoidal, reaches a stable size of maturity.
2231600	2233680	And to emphasize again, the idea is
2233720	2237040	this is all based on the mathematics and properties
2237040	2238320	of networks.
2238320	2243280	So, and this is a sustainable system.
2243280	2245680	It's sustainable phenomenologically,
2245680	2250440	because it's been around a couple of billion years or more.
2250440	2252560	Part of that sustainability, I believe,
2252560	2258040	is actually invoked in the fact that things stop growing.
2258040	2261840	They stabilize, and most organisms, not all,
2261840	2263200	and we can discuss this.
2263200	2266800	Most organisms spend most of their mature life
2266800	2269760	in a stable size configuration.
2269760	2271040	Not all, and there are exceptions,
2271040	2272080	and we can discuss that.
2272080	2276080	But this leads to a sustainable, resilient system.
2276080	2278480	And the question is, oh, I'm sorry, yes.
2278480	2280640	So this is the Motley crew that I work with,
2280640	2283320	some are biologists, some physicists, some chemists.
2283320	2288000	But I then took the work over into social organizations,
2288000	2291320	and there's another Motley crew, that the top guys did
2291320	2293760	all the work.
2293760	2295760	All the guys at the bottom are famous
2295760	2297440	and did none of the work.
2297440	2300880	And the guys in the middle started off with me
2300880	2302960	and then moved on to other things.
2302960	2307680	OK, so here's the question, the first question,
2307680	2310880	about whether cities and companies are biological.
2310880	2312680	The first thing is, do they scale?
2312680	2318680	So what we said before was that whales live in the ocean,
2318680	2321000	and elephants have trunks, and giraffes long necks,
2321000	2323640	and we stand on two feet, and mice scurry around.
2323640	2327000	But in fact, at the kind of 85% level,
2327000	2329120	then scaled versions of one another
2329120	2331760	in this nonlinear, quarter-power fashion,
2331760	2333280	this mathematical fashion.
2333280	2334960	They're scaled versions of one another.
2334960	2337680	Is that true of cities?
2337680	2339680	And is it a kind of universal scaling,
2339680	2340760	as it is in biology?
2340760	2343960	So are cities scaled versions of one another?
2343960	2347160	Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,
2347160	2350960	which is a scaled up Madison, which is a scaled up Santa Fe?
2351000	2352760	Even though they look completely different?
2352760	2354160	Well, you can only answer that.
2354160	2357000	I mean, first sight, it's hard to believe.
2357000	2360160	Every city feels so unique.
2360160	2365240	But of course, you can only answer that by looking at data.
2365240	2367400	But one of the reasons you might think
2367400	2370520	there are scaling phenomena, there
2370520	2373720	are these kind of generic universal similarities,
2373720	2376880	is because cities are indeed networks.
2376880	2378400	I mean, there's the obvious networks
2378400	2382040	of roads and electrical lines and all the rest of it,
2382040	2386080	like this, transportation systems.
2386080	2390840	But more importantly, there's this network, which never
2390840	2392720	occurs, essentially, in biology.
2392720	2395880	It is the network of us talking to one another.
2395880	2399040	It's us, social networks, that is unique.
2399040	2405120	It's only been around on this planet for maybe 10,000 years.
2405120	2407840	Maybe in the universe, for all we know, for 10,000 years.
2408520	2411440	But certainly, in our solar system, this is it.
2411440	2413600	It's new.
2413600	2414360	And it's this.
2414360	2416240	This is just people talking to one another,
2416240	2418840	how they interact with one another.
2418840	2421120	So whoops, I seem to have lost the slide.
2421120	2422000	It doesn't matter.
2422000	2423880	So I use this slide.
2423880	2425360	What is the city but the people?
2425360	2428160	Indeed, the city is not the buildings and the roads
2428160	2430200	and all these other stuff.
2430200	2431000	It's us.
2431000	2432680	We are the city.
2432680	2435520	And that stuff is a manifestation
2435520	2437320	of the interactions between us.
2437320	2440600	And that's something that is outside of biology
2440600	2443840	but is integral to biology because it's driven by biology
2443840	2447200	and it's driven in large part by energy.
2447200	2449320	And I'm going to talk about that.
2449320	2451840	So the other part of the network is not just
2451840	2454240	that we interact with each other but we cluster.
2454240	2456760	So I'm going to not say much more about that
2456760	2460720	but go straight to the data and ask the question about scaling.
2460720	2465520	So this is a graph plotted in the same way
2465520	2467400	as those biological graphs were.
2467400	2470560	But this is a mundane one, the number of petrol stations.
2470560	2472680	I was working with European colleagues,
2472680	2476720	number of gas stations in a city as a function of its size
2476720	2478120	in various countries.
2478120	2481000	And you can see there's pretty good evidence of scaling.
2481000	2484880	It's again, there's a very simple line on this plot
2484880	2487840	plotted this way, very much like biology.
2487840	2491160	And like biology, this would be linear
2491160	2494760	so that you don't, when you double the size of a city,
2494760	2496920	you don't need twice as many gas stations.
2496920	2498640	In fact, what you find from this,
2498640	2501720	you only need about 85% more gas stations.
2501720	2505160	The slope of this line is not three quarters
2505160	2508160	as it is in biology, it's about 0.85, it turns out.
2508160	2511840	Most importantly though is that they're pretty much the same.
2511840	2513600	The slopes of these are the same.
2513600	2516520	The same economy of scale occurs
2516520	2518320	in all these European countries
2518320	2520200	but it occurs in Colombia.
2520200	2522520	It occurs in Chile, it occurs in China.
2522560	2525000	Anywhere you look, across the globe,
2525000	2528520	you get the same scaling and if you look
2528520	2531480	at any infrastructural quantity that you can measure,
2531480	2533640	you get the same scaling as this.
2533640	2538640	There's a consistent, always roughly 15% saving
2539000	2540880	every time you double, okay?
2540880	2542320	Okay, 10.
2542320	2543160	Good, perfect.
2544960	2547320	So this is kind of a mundane quantity
2547320	2549520	but here's, and that's like biology.
2549520	2551800	Looks just like biology except it's 0.85
2552000	2557440	but this is something that doesn't exist in biology.
2557440	2561760	Wages, you lot, super creative people
2561760	2563800	and you ask how do those scale
2563800	2566240	with the size of the city and here they are.
2566240	2570160	This is wages at the top and this is super creative,
2570160	2573160	so-called super creative by a man named Richard Florida
2573160	2577360	and what you see is there's more fluctuations in the data
2577360	2580360	but there's pretty good evidence of scaling
2580360	2583880	but most importantly, the scaling is different
2583880	2585120	than in biology.
2585120	2587240	The slope of these are bigger than one
2587240	2589800	rather than less than one and this is critical.
2589800	2594640	Namely, the slope of these you see is roughly about 1.15
2594640	2599640	so that what that says is that if you double the size
2599800	2602200	instead of needing less per capita,
2602200	2603760	you have more per capita
2603760	2605800	and I will come back to this in a moment.
2605800	2608720	So here's wages, super creative,
2608760	2612600	here's patents, this is some prude measure
2612600	2614520	of the innovation of a city.
2615680	2619000	The slope of this is also about 1.15,
2619000	2623360	this is the crime in Japan, so a little bit bigger, 1.15,
2623360	2626000	this is police, tax receipts, construction,
2626000	2629640	all about 1.15 and there they are all plotted
2629640	2631600	on one another, just a few of them
2631600	2636600	to show a universality of income, GDP, crime and patents,
2637480	2641320	very different things but they all scale in the same way,
2641320	2643280	there's quite a lot of fluctuations
2643280	2647000	and the slope of that is roughly 1.15
2647000	2652000	and what is, we believe that underlying this
2652320	2655120	the universality of social networks
2655120	2657760	of the way we interact with each other
2658600	2660640	is a kind of universal phenomenon
2660640	2663600	whether you're in China, Japan, Columbia,
2663600	2665320	the United States, anywhere,
2665320	2668880	the fundamentals of the social interaction is universal
2668880	2671600	and that is what is being manifested
2671600	2673800	in these scaling laws, these scaling laws
2673800	2676760	are for multiple socioeconomic quantities
2676760	2679120	anywhere in the world, we've looked at data
2679120	2681640	in Europe, the United States, China, Japan,
2681640	2683320	Latin America and so forth.
2684260	2687240	What is interesting to substantiate that
2687240	2689960	is this graph which is very recent data
2689960	2693240	which is the number of cell phone people,
2693240	2696320	none of the people you call on your phone
2696320	2699440	on the average as a function of city size.
2699440	2702320	So this is a kind of way of tapping in
2702320	2705800	to the network, the social network
2705800	2708880	and if this theoretical framework
2708880	2711440	of the mathematics of that social network
2711440	2714680	is the right one, the slope of this should be
2714680	2716600	about the same as these other networks
2716600	2720040	and indeed we could have plotted this on top of this
2720040	2721880	and it would have fit right on top of it.
2721880	2724680	So this is the number of people you talk to
2724680	2729320	on the average as a function of your city size, okay.
2729320	2732720	So I'm gonna miss this
2732720	2734360	and that's what I said a moment ago
2734360	2736200	and here's kind of the summary of this,
2736200	2738080	the good, the bad and the ugly.
2738080	2740040	If you double the size of a city
2740040	2742160	or if you look at a city that's twice as big
2742160	2746520	as another city, then systematically across the globe
2748320	2750880	and you double the size, you can go from 50,000
2750920	2753320	to 100,000 or 5,000,000 to 10,000,000
2753320	2755600	doesn't matter where you begin, just double the size,
2755600	2759000	systematically income, wealth, patents, colleges,
2759000	2761800	creative people, police, crime, AIDS, flu,
2761800	2764080	all of these things, the good, bad and the ugly
2764080	2766880	all go up together to the same degree
2767760	2772040	and at the same time, you save about 15%
2772040	2773920	on the infrastructure.
2773920	2777800	Big cities are good and the bigger ones are better still
2777800	2779440	both at the collective level,
2779440	2782520	they save on infrastructure per capita,
2782520	2784320	I had a graph which I flipped through,
2784320	2787200	they save on carbon footprint per capita
2787200	2789040	and at the individual level,
2791860	2794200	everybody is attracted to cities
2794200	2796200	by the first lot of those income, wealth,
2796200	2799400	number of patents, colleges and the general buzz of city
2799400	2800960	and ignore the other bad things,
2800960	2802760	the fact that they're coming along with it,
2802760	2807760	handing glove as more crime, disease and so forth, okay.
2810280	2812480	So, the network dynamics is the one
2812480	2814720	that dominates this again
2814720	2817360	and the network dynamics has the following
2817360	2822360	interesting phenomenon that if it's sublinear scaling,
2823520	2826920	then we have this pace of life slowing with size
2826920	2829160	that I mentioned, but if it's super linear,
2829160	2833320	bigger than one that we see in socioeconomic systems
2833320	2838100	in cities and are driven by the social networks,
2838100	2840540	then the theory tells you the pace of life
2840540	2843300	systematically increases with size
2843300	2846540	and so the pace of life in New York
2846540	2850700	is systematically faster than it is in Madison,
2850700	2854140	which is systematically faster than it is in Espanola,
2854140	2858660	which is a tiny town here, Santa Fe, in a systematic way
2858660	2862020	and here's some whimsical data to show you that,
2862020	2863060	we've looked at many things,
2863060	2866300	on the left is some data on heart rate versus body size,
2866300	2868820	the one on the right is walking speed,
2868820	2869900	show you walking speed,
2869900	2871900	there's people have actually measured walking speed,
2871900	2876900	perfect and you can see it's systematically rising
2876900	2879380	and it's in reasonably good agreement with the data,
2879380	2883540	but that, you know, why, because walking actually,
2883540	2887900	walking in a city is a social phenomenon, okay.
2887900	2890820	So, I'm gonna miss this out, I think.
2892620	2894140	So, this is kind of a summary
2894140	2896340	and I'm gonna finish off in the last few minutes
2896340	2897340	with the last part of this.
2897340	2902260	So, unlike biology, super linear scaling,
2902260	2904980	socioeconomic, which is to do with wealth creation
2904980	2908620	and innovation and ideas, dominates,
2908620	2910860	and so you get this kind of 15% rule,
2910860	2914140	which I'm not gonna talk about its origins here,
2914140	2916620	that also leads to a systematic increase
2916620	2918540	in the pace of life and the last thing
2918540	2922100	I'm gonna talk about, which is very satisfactory,
2922100	2924740	is that if this is true, which it is,
2924740	2926640	and it comes from these networks,
2926640	2930020	then I'm gonna talk about growth
2930020	2932660	and the idea of open-ended growth following from this
2932660	2936380	because we're gonna use the same kind of growth equation
2936380	2940260	that, again, based on energy equivalent
2940260	2942340	of the flow of energy through these systems
2942340	2946080	leading to maintenance and growth,
2946080	2949100	and that's what we had before for us,
2949100	2952060	the sublinear scaling leading to bounded growth
2952060	2954240	and if it's super linear scaling,
2954240	2955820	there's a cartoon on the left,
2955820	2960820	this leads to actually faster than exponential growth.
2961300	2963700	And that's very satisfying, that's great,
2963700	2964900	because that's what we see
2964900	2967140	and that's what we apparently love
2967140	2969340	or have loved for the last couple of hundred years
2969340	2970260	and that's great.
2970260	2973860	However, it has, if you believe the theory,
2973860	2976660	this has a fatal flaw
2976660	2980740	and the fatal flaw is denoted by this line
2980780	2982900	and it's called in the technical language
2982900	2985460	a finite time singularity
2985460	2988020	and to put it in very simple language,
2988020	2990980	what it says is that in some finite time,
2990980	2994660	this damn growth curve will go to infinite size
2994660	2996380	and that's obviously impossible.
2996380	2998340	So this is kind of a Malthusian argument,
2998340	3000180	namely at some stage,
3000180	3001980	you're gonna run out of whatever it is
3001980	3003660	that's keeping the system alive,
3003660	3006300	the resources, the energy, whatever it is
3006300	3008220	and the theory tells you what happens,
3008260	3011180	it says as you go through this so-called singularity,
3011180	3013220	you stagnate and collapse.
3013220	3015500	That's terrible and we need to avoid that
3015500	3017340	and we have avoided it
3017340	3019100	and this is how we avoid it.
3019100	3022620	We avoid it for the very reason
3022620	3027620	that Malthus and Paul Ehrlich were rejected,
3027740	3030060	that is they did not take into account
3030060	3032780	the fact that we innovate ourselves out of these problems.
3032780	3034440	So I wanna finish on this note.
3034440	3035880	So here's the situation.
3036880	3041440	This is you start at some point and you start growing
3041440	3045040	and you would hit this singularity and collapse.
3045040	3047520	So somewhere along here,
3048740	3050840	you better change something
3050840	3054840	because this growth was done in the paradigm
3054840	3056600	of whatever the major innovation is.
3056600	3059120	It could be the discovery of iron,
3059120	3061680	could be the discovery of coal, could be oil,
3061680	3063760	it could be the invention of computers,
3063760	3065240	the invention of IT,
3065240	3068880	that's something major that has a kind of paradigm shift
3068880	3069920	and changes everything.
3069920	3074560	So this suggests that the way out of this dilemma
3074560	3079080	of collapse is that you innovate somewhere here
3079080	3080200	and you start over again.
3080200	3083800	You reset the clock and then you can go on merrily
3083800	3084640	and of course you're gonna hit
3084640	3087040	another finite time singularity and collapse
3087040	3089260	unless you innovate again.
3089260	3090560	So you have to keep innovating.
3090560	3092480	So there's a kind of theorem if you like
3093480	3097160	that if you want to continue to have open-ended growth,
3097160	3098920	you have to have cycles of innovation.
3098920	3100680	Well, people have been saying things like that
3100680	3102120	for a long time.
3102120	3105760	Here's the difference going back to what we said.
3108160	3112440	As you grow and you get bigger, the pace of life increases.
3112440	3114520	So first of all, the pace of life is increasing.
3114520	3117280	Second thing is it turns out the theory says,
3117280	3118800	yes, you can do this,
3118840	3123840	but the time to go from here to here necessarily
3123920	3127040	has to be and systematically shorter
3127040	3128840	than the time from here to here.
3128840	3130160	So that you can innovate,
3130160	3131920	you can have these cycles of innovation,
3131920	3133880	but they must come quicker and quicker.
3135200	3138760	So the image is that we're on this treadmill
3138760	3141360	that is going faster and faster,
3141360	3143240	which is difficult to begin with.
3143240	3147160	But at some stage you've got to jump from that treadmill
3147160	3150400	onto another treadmill that's going even faster.
3150400	3152920	And then very soon you've got to jump onto another one
3152920	3154800	and you've got to kind of keep doing this.
3154800	3157000	So you have this kind of double acceleration
3157000	3158200	and the question is,
3158200	3161640	do you suffer a kind of global heart attack from that?
3161640	3163680	So is this sustainable?
3164520	3166200	Obviously not, ultimately.
3167600	3169120	And here's, this is not mine at all.
3169120	3172040	This is someone I don't know who he is, but he did it
3172040	3174480	and he showed, you know, it was great.
3174480	3178600	Oh, this is something I saw in an English newspaper
3178600	3182320	a week ago, which I thought illustrated the point
3182320	3183160	a little bit.
3185000	3187200	So here's something, some of you may have heard
3187200	3190440	of the idea of singularity from this,
3190440	3194800	what I consider a little bit loony work of Ray Kurzweil.
3195960	3196920	I think this is loony,
3196920	3199520	but he did some wonderful things of collecting data.
3199520	3201200	I don't agree with a lot of this,
3201200	3204240	but what he's plotted here is that
3204320	3206840	here's the paradigm shift.
3206840	3211840	That is, how long it took to create each one
3211960	3216560	of these paradigms versus how long ago it happened.
3216560	3221080	Okay, so, and what you see is it takes shorter and shorter
3221080	3224680	times to make these shifts
3224680	3226800	and it's happening faster and faster.
3226800	3228200	And he drew this, he got them,
3228200	3230200	there's all kinds of people who've done things like this.
3230200	3231760	I'm gonna finish up.
3231800	3233720	And whoops.
3233720	3237560	And interestingly enough, that straight line,
3237560	3239440	if you take this theoretical framework
3239440	3240560	that I just told you about,
3240560	3242780	this continuous innovation and jumping
3242780	3244760	from one treadmill to another,
3244760	3247960	it predicts almost exactly that orange line.
3247960	3250880	So that's data kind of supporting it.
3250880	3252520	So I'm gonna finish with that
3252520	3255480	and I'm gonna finish with one last image,
3255480	3258240	which is this, just to give you a sense of things
3258240	3261120	in terms of energy, our metabolic rate,
3261120	3262760	I didn't point that out on the graph.
3262760	3264480	You remember that graph of metabolic rate?
3264480	3268080	Our metabolic rate in watts is about 90 watts,
3268080	3270920	a little bit less women versus men,
3270920	3272320	but roughly it's about 90 watts.
3272320	3273160	We're a light bulb.
3273160	3277640	One of the bloody light bulbs is equivalent to one of us.
3277640	3280400	So turning a light bulb off,
3280400	3281600	it's like your mother turning you.
3281600	3284360	If you turn it off, you help the starving people
3284360	3286280	in Sudan or somewhere.
3286280	3289640	So it's ridiculous having all these lights on, frankly.
3289640	3290480	They're us.
3290480	3292640	We are extraordinarily efficient.
3292640	3296720	That 1,800, 2,000 food calories a day
3296720	3298960	is unbelievably efficient.
3298960	3301800	May seem like a lot of food, but it's just a light bulb.
3303360	3306920	However, and incidentally,
3306920	3310240	that metabolic rate is the metabolic rate
3310240	3313880	we should have for a mammal of our size.
3313880	3316160	That's what we should have, okay?
3316200	3319960	And if you add in activity, hunting and gathering,
3319960	3323080	which is the way we evolve or versions thereof,
3323080	3326080	that number changes from 100 to about 250,
3326080	3328560	the amount of energy we do to hunt and gather and so on.
3328560	3332800	And that also scales the active metabolic rate for mammals.
3332800	3334600	So that's what we, quote, should have.
3334600	3336600	Then we started talking to one another.
3338600	3341720	We discovered economies of scale to form communities,
3341720	3343440	and then we started to innovate.
3343440	3344960	And once we innovated,
3344960	3347480	we created all of this around us,
3347480	3350680	all this wonderful quality of life and standard of living
3350680	3352560	that we'd like to have for everybody.
3352560	3355680	And we can ask, what is our real metabolic rate?
3355680	3357320	What is our social metabolic rate
3357320	3359880	of having cars and lights and buildings
3359880	3361560	and all the rest of the stuff?
3361560	3366560	That number goes from about 90 watts to 11,000 watts.
3367600	3368760	And you can turn it around,
3368760	3371400	as has been done on this graph as I did here,
3371400	3373200	and ask, how big is it?
3373200	3374680	What big an animal are we?
3374680	3378000	This is about a dozen elephants,
3378000	3379520	each one of us in this room.
3379520	3381920	And there are seven billion people of us on this planet
3381920	3383840	who all want to be like us,
3383840	3387440	and there's three billion more coming in the next 30, 40 years,
3387440	3390360	and they all want to be like us using 11,000 watts.
3391360	3393600	So this is an enormous problem,
3393600	3395640	and I cannot answer the question,
3395640	3397840	what is the future and what does it bring?
3397840	3400640	But I can say that I'm a pessimist.
3400680	3402000	So I'll finish on that.
3402000	3402840	Oh.
3402840	3403680	Thank you.
3403680	3404520	Thank you.
3404520	3405360	Thank you.
