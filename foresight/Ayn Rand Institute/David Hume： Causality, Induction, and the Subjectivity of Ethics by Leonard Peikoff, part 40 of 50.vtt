00:00.000 --> 00:13.320
Well, where are we now?

00:13.320 --> 00:16.360
What do we have in Hume's universe?

00:16.360 --> 00:21.840
We have a bundle of impressions or experiences, images, and so on.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.880
Impressions of what?

00:23.880 --> 00:25.800
Nothing.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.980
External world is a myth.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.940
Experiences experienced by whom?

00:33.940 --> 00:35.100
Nobody.

00:35.100 --> 00:38.180
The self is a myth.

00:38.180 --> 00:42.940
Now you might think this is as far as we can go in skepticism.

00:42.940 --> 00:46.820
Impressions of nothing by nobody.

00:46.820 --> 00:50.420
But there is more to go yet.

00:50.420 --> 00:58.980
There is one very famous and incredibly influential point of Hume's that is almost universally accepted today by philosophers.

00:58.980 --> 01:10.460
There is still one more link tying the world or tying experiences together, which must be shattered if we're to end up with a real poached egg mentality.

01:10.460 --> 01:15.420
And that is the law of cause and effect.

01:15.420 --> 01:20.220
Remember Barclay had believed in cause and effect coming from God.

01:20.220 --> 01:22.260
Hobbes had believed in cause and effect.

01:22.260 --> 01:27.060
Every major philosopher prior to Hume believed in cause and effect.

01:27.100 --> 01:33.940
Hume now sets his nominalism and sensualism to work to demolish cause and effect too.

01:33.940 --> 01:37.860
So now we'll look at Hume's greatest quote achievement.

01:37.860 --> 01:43.020
His destruction of the law of cause and effect.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.140
Well again, we follow the standard procedure.

01:45.140 --> 01:48.220
Let's take the term cause.

01:48.220 --> 01:50.060
What does it mean?

01:50.060 --> 01:53.940
We say A causes B.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.660
Take a classic simple example.

01:55.660 --> 01:58.340
We take a rock and throw it at a window.

01:58.340 --> 01:59.460
The window shatters.

01:59.460 --> 02:03.980
We say the rock caused the window to break.

02:03.980 --> 02:08.420
What does it mean to say one thing caused another?

02:08.420 --> 02:13.700
Well says Hume, people think that there are three points involved.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.980
Two of them as we'll see are OK.

02:15.980 --> 02:21.020
One, the vital one proves to be meaningless.

02:21.020 --> 02:26.300
Well one thing involved in the causal relationship is spatial contiguity.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.140
Togetherness in space.

02:29.140 --> 02:35.300
The rock actually touches the window for instance in the process of it breaking.

02:35.300 --> 02:36.620
Well that's very simple.

02:36.620 --> 02:39.740
We can see the two of them in direct physical contact.

02:39.740 --> 02:45.740
So we have a direct perceptual reference for the phrase spatial contiguity or spatial togetherness.

02:45.740 --> 02:48.380
And therefore that's perfectly meaningful.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.420
But that of course is not enough.

02:50.460 --> 02:55.380
Causal relationship also involves temporal contiguity.

02:55.380 --> 03:00.740
The window breaks immediately after in time the rock strikes.

03:00.740 --> 03:05.740
And again says Hume, that's a perfectly respectable phrase temporal contiguity

03:05.740 --> 03:11.740
because we can observe one thing happening immediately after another in time

03:11.740 --> 03:15.100
and therefore that is perfectly meaningful.

03:15.140 --> 03:22.660
But spatial and temporal contiguity after all do not yet give us the essence of the causal relationship.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.700
A coincidence can have these two characteristics.

03:26.700 --> 03:30.900
For instance suppose I casually touch this lecture.

03:30.900 --> 03:38.820
And while I'm in direct contact with it spatially, at the next instant it suddenly gives off,

03:38.820 --> 03:43.940
I don't know, 13 bombs in the whole room and whole building come down.

03:43.940 --> 03:49.740
Well you would say maybe the two events were spatially and temporally connected

03:49.740 --> 03:51.500
but that simply is a coincidence.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.300
There's no causal connection.

03:53.300 --> 03:57.780
Maybe someone in the next room let off a bomb at the same instant.

03:57.780 --> 04:04.340
What is the crucial factor, the vital ingredient in the concept of causal connection?

04:04.340 --> 04:08.740
Well says Hume, it is necessary connection.

04:08.740 --> 04:13.580
Not only spatial and temporal contiguity but necessary connection.

04:13.620 --> 04:19.460
When we say A causes B, we mean more than simply the two go together in space

04:19.460 --> 04:21.620
and the two go together in time.

04:21.620 --> 04:25.900
We mean that the first necessitates the second.

04:25.900 --> 04:29.940
That the two have a compulsory connection to each other.

04:29.940 --> 04:33.980
That granted the first the second must happen.

04:33.980 --> 04:37.380
That the first produces the second.

04:37.380 --> 04:40.220
That the first makes the second happen.

04:40.220 --> 04:45.540
Etc. All those being synonyms for necessary connection.

04:45.540 --> 04:53.980
Well now let us put this strand, necessary connection to the test of the theory of meaning.

04:53.980 --> 05:04.020
Do we ever perceive or form an image of necessary connection between events?

05:04.020 --> 05:05.620
Now watch it very closely.

05:05.620 --> 05:12.060
I don't have a window here to demonstrate but you just have to project that I take a rock

05:12.060 --> 05:17.020
and I throw it at the window and you see the rock sailing slowly across the room.

05:17.020 --> 05:23.100
Then you see, now you can stand there you right next to the wall with a magnifying glass to watch.

05:23.100 --> 05:26.700
You see the rock moving, touch the window.

05:26.700 --> 05:30.180
So far there's no necessity, there's just a rock, right?

05:30.180 --> 05:33.420
The next thing you see the fragment shattered, right?

05:33.420 --> 05:41.060
Now no little flag came out and said, the next event is unavoidable.

05:41.060 --> 05:47.940
There was no booming voice from the sky that said, what comes now has to be.

05:47.940 --> 05:54.740
There was no Doris Day saying K-Sara-Sara.

05:54.740 --> 05:59.340
We perceive that two events go together in space and time, that's all.

05:59.340 --> 06:04.420
We never come in contact with any such phenomenon as necessity.

06:04.420 --> 06:06.060
What is necessity like?

06:06.060 --> 06:07.420
Is it red?

06:07.420 --> 06:08.740
Is it loud?

06:08.740 --> 06:10.460
Is it a heart?

06:10.460 --> 06:13.620
Well, can you form an image of it?

06:13.620 --> 06:14.940
What does it look like?

06:14.940 --> 06:16.980
What would it taste like?

06:16.980 --> 06:20.380
Obviously we cannot form a perceptive necessity.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.940
We cannot form an image of necessity.

06:24.020 --> 06:30.220
It must therefore be an utterly meaningless term.

06:30.220 --> 06:35.780
The phrase necessary connection must be just noise, like gloop.

06:35.780 --> 06:40.860
And so of course must any of its synonyms, the synonym of nonsense is nonsense.

06:40.860 --> 06:44.540
And therefore when you say one thing produces another or makes it happen or

06:44.540 --> 06:50.660
given the first, the second must happen, all of those are equally meaningless.

06:50.660 --> 06:57.780
Now let's have Hume speak for himself on this, quote.

06:57.780 --> 07:02.140
First, he states his nominalism and sensualism, quote.

07:02.140 --> 07:06.020
It seems a proposition which will not admit of much dispute,

07:06.020 --> 07:11.820
that all our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions.

07:11.820 --> 07:13.300
That's his sensualism, you see.

07:13.300 --> 07:18.620
An idea is simply a faded copy of your sense experience.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.460
To be fully acquainted, I'm continuing the quote.

07:20.460 --> 07:25.500
To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of necessary connection,

07:25.500 --> 07:27.740
let us examine its impression.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.980
In order to find the impression with greater certainty,

07:31.980 --> 07:36.380
let us search forward in all the sources from which it may possibly be derived.

07:37.660 --> 07:42.660
Now, unquote, now he conducts a scrupulous search all over the place,

07:42.660 --> 07:45.540
looking for a necessary connection if only he could find it.

07:45.540 --> 07:51.300
And, quote, when we look about us towards external objects and

07:51.300 --> 07:57.300
consider the operation of causes, we are never able in a single instance to

07:57.300 --> 08:00.100
discover any power or necessary connection.

08:01.220 --> 08:05.020
Any quality which binds the effect to the cause and

08:05.020 --> 08:08.740
renders the one an infallible consequence of the other.

08:08.740 --> 08:14.820
We only find that the one does actually, in fact, follow the other.

08:14.820 --> 08:18.740
There is not in any single particular instance of cause and

08:18.740 --> 08:24.780
effect anything which can suggest the idea of necessary connection, unquote.

08:26.300 --> 08:31.980
Well, if an idea is a name for a fading experience,

08:31.980 --> 08:36.220
a copy of an experience, and there is no experience of necessary connection,

08:36.220 --> 08:41.860
there is no idea of necessary connection, the phrase must be meaningless.

08:41.860 --> 08:48.140
When, therefore, you take a knife and put it in somebody's heart and twist it.

08:48.140 --> 08:50.940
One event is observing the knife go in, and

08:50.940 --> 08:55.380
the next event is you see the man turn pale and lie down on the ground.

08:55.380 --> 08:59.380
And those are two events that are spatially and temporally contiguous, and

08:59.380 --> 09:00.740
that's it.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.140
You cannot say one made the other happen.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.220
All you have a right to assert, in fact,

09:07.220 --> 09:11.260
the only thing that is meaningful to us is that the two events go together in

09:11.260 --> 09:12.220
space and time.

09:13.940 --> 09:19.300
You observe that one is right next to the other, that one is right after the other,

09:19.300 --> 09:22.540
but you can't observe that one is because of the other.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.860
And of course, that's right, you can't observe the causality.

09:28.700 --> 09:33.100
Well, why do you think that there is a necessary relationship?

09:34.420 --> 09:39.700
If, in fact, this is a myth, again, because you have an overactive imagination.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.740
In this case, you have a hyperactive associative mechanism.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.980
Two events, which in fact have no necessary connection, or

09:49.980 --> 09:52.020
if it would be meaningless to say so.

09:52.020 --> 09:57.100
Two events happen by chance to go together so

09:57.100 --> 10:02.020
many times in your experience, that after a while you form the habit,

10:02.020 --> 10:07.980
simply by custom, by conditioning, to expect the second when you encounter the first.

10:07.980 --> 10:11.980
That is the source of the irrational idea of necessary connection.

10:12.940 --> 10:18.700
You observe, says Hume, repeated conjunctions, repeated conjunctions.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.020
Two events, which happen to go together repeatedly.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.660
And you begin to associate the two and expect the second after the first.

10:25.660 --> 10:29.780
For instance, suppose you were brought up by an irrational mother.

10:30.820 --> 10:35.420
And for no reason at all, every morning when you sat down

10:35.420 --> 10:40.220
by breakfast, at breakfast to drink a glass of orange juice.

10:40.220 --> 10:43.940
Just as you picked the glass of orange juice up, she had a huge strap and

10:43.940 --> 10:46.260
she smashed the kitchen table with it.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.980
Now, on this happened day after day.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.580
There's no causal connection, but that's just the kind of mother you have.

10:53.420 --> 10:58.620
After a while, as you pick up the oranges, you flinch in the expectation of the strap.

10:58.620 --> 11:04.020
And you come to associate the two, you see, simply by quantity of repetition.

11:04.020 --> 11:08.940
Well, Hume says this is exactly the relationship in every case where we

11:08.940 --> 11:09.980
assert causal effect.

11:09.980 --> 11:10.860
That's not his example.

11:12.620 --> 11:17.180
Causality is simply a subjective expectation on our part.

11:17.180 --> 11:20.380
Completely irrational without any justification.

11:22.260 --> 11:27.500
You can use the word cause if you want, but then all it means is

11:27.500 --> 11:32.700
two events are repeatedly conjoined up to now in our experience.

11:32.700 --> 11:38.180
Then we, therefore, have the accompanying irrational, baseless expectation

11:38.180 --> 11:41.420
that there's some connection between them.

11:41.420 --> 11:44.260
But in fact, there is no connection.

11:44.260 --> 11:47.660
I think I have one more quote from Hume on this.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.780
Quote, famous conclusion.

11:54.780 --> 11:59.900
All events seem entirely loose and separate.

11:59.900 --> 12:00.980
Loose and separate.

12:01.940 --> 12:07.460
One event follows another, but we never can observe any tie between them.

12:07.460 --> 12:11.580
They seem conjoined, but never connected.

12:11.580 --> 12:16.860
And as we have no idea of anything which never appeared to our senses,

12:16.860 --> 12:22.660
the conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connection at all.

12:22.660 --> 12:27.260
And that this word is absolutely without any meaning when employed either in

12:27.260 --> 12:30.460
philosophical reasoning or common life.

12:30.460 --> 12:31.820
Unquote.

12:31.820 --> 12:34.220
That's uncompromising Humean statement.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.700
Now, suppose you can test this and say, oh, that's ridiculous.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.620
Causality is not simply a matter of habit.

12:41.620 --> 12:44.260
Causal sequences are necessary.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.900
Their opposites are literally inconceivable.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.260
We couldn't even imagine their opposites happening.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.940
Hume comes back with a famous example.

12:52.940 --> 12:57.460
He says, you can't perfectly well imagine the opposite happening.

12:58.980 --> 13:03.100
He gives the example of Adam, of course, he doesn't believe in Adam.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.340
Doesn't believe in anything, but it's just as an example of the first man.

13:07.340 --> 13:09.980
Now, Adam across the garden sees a flame.

13:11.980 --> 13:18.140
Is Adam able to know before he experiences the behavior of the flame?

13:18.140 --> 13:22.420
That the flame is going to consume him if he puts his hand into it.

13:23.300 --> 13:27.780
No, he says, Adam hasn't the faintest idea how this orange

13:27.780 --> 13:33.580
tongue that's flickering is going to behave when he puts his hand into it.

13:33.580 --> 13:39.300
Prior to experience, if we asked Adam, is it gonna make you six feet taller,

13:39.300 --> 13:43.020
burn your hand off, or turn you into a pumpkin, Adam would say, I haven't a clue.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.300
Well, it says, Hume, what has he got after experience?

13:48.300 --> 13:50.300
After experience, he's got a burned hand.

13:51.300 --> 13:55.620
But he doesn't have any more understanding of why this took place.

13:55.620 --> 14:00.260
As far as you can see, the fire could just as well have turned him into ice or

14:00.260 --> 14:01.060
into a pumpkin.

14:02.620 --> 14:08.980
In other words, it simply is a matter of brute fact that it happens to be the case

14:08.980 --> 14:13.980
that fire up to now burns or warms.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.940
But it's unintelligible why this is so, and

14:16.940 --> 14:19.700
we can easily conceive the opposite.

14:21.180 --> 14:26.420
Now, if someone were to say that we can explain by reference to scientific law,

14:26.420 --> 14:31.620
why fire does what it does, Hume would say scientific law.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.660
Scientific law is based on cause and effect.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.300
Cause and effect depends on necessary connection, and

14:37.300 --> 14:40.060
that's meaningless, so much for scientific laws.

14:41.620 --> 14:46.340
All we do is we let our familiarity with certain arbitrary

14:46.340 --> 14:51.700
sequences delude us into thinking that the connection is intelligible,

14:51.700 --> 14:53.660
when actually it's completely unintelligible.

14:54.860 --> 14:59.980
Well, suppose you try to give Hume a proof in logic,

14:59.980 --> 15:03.420
that every event must have a cause that necessitates it.

15:05.220 --> 15:08.460
Well, Hume says, go ahead and try, and

15:08.460 --> 15:11.140
I'll show you that you can't give me any such proof.

15:11.140 --> 15:17.100
Is your proof going to rely on reason, he says?

15:17.100 --> 15:20.060
You answer, well, certainly I'm going to give a rational proof.

15:21.340 --> 15:26.220
Well, says Hume, by reason we can only prove truths whose opposites

15:26.220 --> 15:30.900
would be contradictory, logical contradictions.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.660
Reason teaches us that we have to believe something because

15:33.660 --> 15:35.940
the opposite would be a contradiction.

15:35.940 --> 15:39.420
So we can prove that two and two is four because if somebody denied it,

15:39.420 --> 15:41.460
we could show him he was contradicting himself.

15:43.020 --> 15:47.860
Now, anything which is a contradiction is inconceivable.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.340
You can't conceive around square, for instance,

15:50.340 --> 15:52.900
because it's the two sides annihilate each other.

15:54.940 --> 15:59.540
Now, is there any difficulty in conceiving that the law of cause and

15:59.540 --> 16:01.860
effect is false?

16:01.860 --> 16:06.380
Would any contradiction be involved, he asks, in conceiving it?

16:06.380 --> 16:10.500
No, the opposite of the law of cause and effect, he says,

16:10.500 --> 16:12.740
is perfectly conceivable.

16:12.740 --> 16:14.340
It's easy to understand.

16:14.340 --> 16:20.340
It's not like a round square which obliterates it itself.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.500
It's perfectly conceivable.

16:23.700 --> 16:30.140
Take that idea, there are events which don't have any causes.

16:30.140 --> 16:34.900
Now, if this was a contradiction, we shouldn't even be able to grasp it.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.540
It should be like married bachelor.

16:37.540 --> 16:40.820
But says, Hume, there's no difficulty in grasping this.

16:40.820 --> 16:43.780
Just imagine, I'm making up the example, but this is his idea.

16:43.780 --> 16:46.700
Imagine you're walking down the street and

16:46.700 --> 16:51.860
suddenly an apple pops into existence out of thin air.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.980
Nothing preceded it, it's not a hallucination.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.060
It just is there without any cause.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.260
Walt Disney could drop.

17:00.980 --> 17:04.140
Now says, Hume, this is perfectly conceivable.

17:04.140 --> 17:05.660
There's no contradiction in it.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.780
If there were a contradiction, you couldn't conceive it.

17:07.780 --> 17:11.300
But you understood my story, so you must be able to conceive it.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.140
Whereas if I said a round square popped out,

17:14.140 --> 17:15.500
you'd say, I don't know what that is.

17:16.820 --> 17:19.380
If it's conceivable, there's no contradiction.

17:19.380 --> 17:22.380
If there's no contradiction, reason can't prove it.

17:22.380 --> 17:25.580
Reason only proves something whose opposite is a contradiction.

17:25.580 --> 17:29.700
Therefore, the law of cause and effect cannot be proved.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.100
Since it can't be proved in reason, and

17:32.100 --> 17:36.140
we know there's no basis for it in reference to experience,

17:37.180 --> 17:42.060
we conclude the law of cause and effect is bereft of any foundation of any kind.

17:42.060 --> 17:47.380
In reason or in experience, it is therefore simply a myth.

17:49.900 --> 17:56.420
Now, of course, the objections to this Humean viewpoint are legion.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.380
Since this is the last time I'll get my licks in it,

17:59.380 --> 18:03.300
you might keep interrupting each point because I can't put it off anymore

18:03.300 --> 18:05.340
that, of course, having running out.

18:05.340 --> 18:06.860
But let me just indicate briefly.

18:08.300 --> 18:13.660
Notice that Hume assumes that if he can visualize an event that takes place

18:13.660 --> 18:18.580
allegedly without a cause, that that's the same as saying he conceives it

18:18.580 --> 18:19.700
without contradiction.

18:20.660 --> 18:24.620
Now, of course, if Aristotle heard this argument, he would say,

18:25.620 --> 18:29.900
you are visualizing an event which implies a contradiction.

18:30.900 --> 18:34.980
And therefore, you are actually conceiving nothing but an irrational

18:34.980 --> 18:37.460
figment of your own imagination.

18:37.460 --> 18:40.860
You have an image, but not a logical concept.

18:41.860 --> 18:43.900
What would Hume's answer be if he heard that?

18:45.260 --> 18:46.380
What's the difference?

18:47.620 --> 18:49.460
An image is a concept.

18:49.460 --> 18:53.060
If I can form an image of something, I've formed a concept of it.

18:53.260 --> 18:56.100
That, of course, is his nominalism.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.500
Concept is an image.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.060
So if you can form an image, you can form a concept.

19:01.060 --> 19:05.100
And if you can form a concept, then it's obviously logically possible.

19:05.100 --> 19:10.260
Therefore, if you can form an image, any arbitrary fantastic image,

19:10.260 --> 19:13.220
the thing it stands for is logically possible.

19:13.220 --> 19:18.300
That is the end result of reducing concepts to images the way the nominalists do.

19:18.300 --> 19:24.940
Now, you might think you would satisfy Hume if you gave him the proof of cause and

19:24.940 --> 19:27.340
effect that we developed from Aristotle's philosophy.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.620
You remember the argument which had essentially two premises.

19:31.620 --> 19:36.300
Actions are actions of entities, and entities have identity.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.820
They are what they are, the law of identity, and therefore,

19:39.820 --> 19:43.980
to make a long story short, they can only act in accordance with their nature.

19:43.980 --> 19:49.900
Now, if you were to reincarnate David Hume and give him this argument,

19:49.900 --> 19:52.220
he wouldn't bat an eye or turn a hair.

19:53.820 --> 20:01.020
Because observe each premise, entities, he would say, what is that?

20:01.020 --> 20:04.700
All we have are loose, floating bundles of qualities.

20:04.700 --> 20:08.660
And that's all that he as a nominalist sensualist can encounter.

20:08.660 --> 20:13.500
And therefore, the premise about entities existing is already out.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.580
And so is therefore the base of any proof of cause and effect given his nominalist.

20:17.580 --> 20:23.340
And as for the law of identity, is that supposed to be a necessary general truth?

20:23.340 --> 20:27.820
Well, then, as a nominalist, that, of course, must be linguistic,

20:27.820 --> 20:29.980
semantic, just the way you use words.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.100
It doesn't say anything.

20:32.060 --> 20:38.620
Now, you see, in other words, causality has already comes fairly far down a philosophy.

20:38.620 --> 20:44.540
You first of all have to have the conceptual level to validate your knowledge of anything,

20:44.540 --> 20:45.980
including of causality.

20:47.180 --> 20:52.700
So there's actually nothing new to answer in Hume's attack on cause and effect.

20:52.700 --> 20:58.220
If you can answer his nominalism and sensualism, if you can defend a valid theory of concepts,

20:58.860 --> 21:02.380
then his whole attack on cause and effect crashes to the ground,

21:02.380 --> 21:04.300
along with the whole rest of his philosophy.

21:04.940 --> 21:08.620
And of course, if you cannot answer his nominalism and sensualism,

21:09.180 --> 21:12.460
then you are lost and everything is lost.

21:13.180 --> 21:19.020
And you see, again, the crucial importance of a valid theory of concepts.

21:21.340 --> 21:29.340
In any event, for Hume, the collapse of cause and effect leads to overwhelming insoluble problems.

21:30.060 --> 21:33.980
It leads him to complete and total skepticism.

21:35.260 --> 21:39.980
Because if there is no cause and effect, how can we predict the future?

21:41.100 --> 21:42.540
How can we generalize?

21:43.980 --> 21:47.820
How can we say that because things have happened a certain way in the past,

21:48.380 --> 21:50.700
therefore they will happen that way in the future?

21:51.340 --> 21:53.900
How can we ever formulate scientific laws?

21:53.900 --> 21:59.980
How can we even have science to all of which Hume's answer is, you can't.

22:00.380 --> 22:08.300
We have, he says, no reason on earth to assume that nature follows law.

22:09.420 --> 22:12.700
We have no reason to assume that nature is uniform.

22:12.700 --> 22:16.460
We have no reason to assume that the future will be like the past.

22:17.820 --> 22:20.860
This is known as the problem of induction.

22:21.580 --> 22:27.420
And the problem of induction is what makes you think that because something has happened

22:27.500 --> 22:32.220
a certain way repeatedly in the past, it will therefore happen that way in the future.

22:33.180 --> 22:39.660
Now, of course, if there are necessary connections in reality, if there are actual laws

22:39.660 --> 22:46.220
which nature must obey, then you can validly generalize from experience under the appropriate

22:46.220 --> 22:54.620
circumstances. But if you destroy causality and you reduce it, nature, to simply unintelligible,

22:54.700 --> 23:01.340
brute conjunction of events without any necessity, then anything is possible at the next instant.

23:02.060 --> 23:06.860
And the fact that something has happened a thousand times proves nothing about the future.

23:07.580 --> 23:10.540
It's simply been a run of coincidence.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.940
Now, people often misunderstand Hume.

23:15.900 --> 23:20.300
And they think he is saying, well, you can never be certain about the future.

23:20.300 --> 23:24.860
You can only have a degree of probability. He goes much beyond that.

23:25.660 --> 23:31.340
He says you can't even have the faintest trace of probability with regard to the future.

23:31.980 --> 23:38.140
Every occurrence is a brand new event. All events are loose and separate.

23:38.140 --> 23:42.380
There is no necessity about any conjunction of events.

23:42.940 --> 23:48.460
And therefore, you haven't the slightest reason, he says, to assume that the future will resemble

23:48.460 --> 23:56.780
the past in any respect. If I throw a penny up in the air, now up to now, the penny has come down.

23:57.580 --> 24:01.820
And you might be inclined to say, well, there's a good chance it'll come down again.

24:02.620 --> 24:07.260
But of course, in Hume's philosophy, there's only one chance in infinity that it will come down.

24:09.420 --> 24:15.660
It might still stand still. It might go straight up. It might turn into a hagel.

24:15.660 --> 24:21.020
It might become a quarter. It could do anything.

24:22.300 --> 24:26.780
Now you say, but it's become, it's come down so many times in the past.

24:26.780 --> 24:31.820
Well, I've heard Hume and say that just goes to show that we have had such a run of good luck

24:31.820 --> 24:40.540
that we shouldn't expect it to continue. That's known as the problem of induction.

24:40.700 --> 24:47.180
Well, we've reached a total dead end, an absolutely shattered universe.

24:47.180 --> 24:55.820
We have loosely floating qualities, no entities, no reality, no self, no causality,

24:56.380 --> 25:02.620
everything a brute contingent fact. Now let's mop up some final points.

25:03.180 --> 25:10.700
Is there any necessary knowledge, according to Hume, anything we can know as necessary?

25:11.580 --> 25:19.500
Yes, he says, but not matters of fact. Not matters of fact. Anything which talks about the way things

25:19.500 --> 25:29.980
actually are, any factual statement is contingent. We derive it from experience. It is empirical.

25:30.780 --> 25:36.460
Aposteriora, using the term I introduced last time, which means dependent on experience.

25:37.180 --> 25:46.300
Well, then where do we get necessary knowledge of? Only in what Hume calls relations of ideas.

25:48.140 --> 25:54.460
If I, out of the statement, bachelors are male, I can know that that has to be true.

25:54.460 --> 26:03.660
Because, says Hume, it is a matter of definition. I define bachelor as an entity one of whose

26:03.660 --> 26:09.660
characteristics is being male, and therefore this is a necessary truth. I can count on it,

26:09.660 --> 26:15.900
but it doesn't tell me anything about facts. It would be true even if there are no bachelors.

26:16.780 --> 26:26.380
It's necessary simply because we make it so by our arbitrary nominalistic definitions. If it's

26:26.380 --> 26:32.300
stated an actual fact of reality, he would say, how would you ever know it is necessary?

26:33.100 --> 26:40.140
Therefore this kind of truth, the so-called relations of ideas, we arrive at that by reason

26:40.220 --> 26:45.660
or thought or analysis. In their case, the opposite would be a contradiction.

26:46.460 --> 26:53.420
They are learned by definition, not by experience. They are so-called a priori.

26:54.140 --> 26:59.260
And so we have the standard dichotomy that we have seen in so many different forms,

27:00.380 --> 27:06.940
as it exists in Hume, the linguistic truths versus the existential or factual truths,

27:06.940 --> 27:13.580
the logical truths versus the factual truths, the truths of reason which are necessary but

27:13.580 --> 27:22.220
detached from reality, and the truths of experience which pertain to fact but are contingent.

27:22.780 --> 27:29.900
You see this is a variant of the standard dichotomy, and this is what Kahn then picked up

27:29.900 --> 27:35.580
and called the analytic, the truths versus the synthetic, the analytic being the ones you arrive

27:35.580 --> 27:41.500
at by analysis, the logical truths so-called, and the synthetic being the ones that tell you

27:41.500 --> 27:49.740
actual empirical information. Now, given this, which is therefore not original with Hume,

27:51.660 --> 27:58.780
what happens to metaphysics if you accept this dichotomy of the necessary relations of ideas

27:58.780 --> 28:06.220
which are linguistic versus the contingent factual empirical truths? Well, is metaphysics

28:07.020 --> 28:12.860
supposed to be factual? Well, the advocates of metaphysics say certainly metaphysics tells you

28:12.860 --> 28:20.620
facts about reality. Well, if it's factual, it has to be empirical. Is metaphysics supposed to

28:20.620 --> 28:27.260
therefore tell you simply contingent empirical hypotheses? No, the advocates of metaphysical

28:27.260 --> 28:32.540
principles like cause and effect, for instance, say they are necessary. Well, there's no such

28:32.540 --> 28:40.540
possibility as a factual necessary truth. If it's necessary, it's simply linguistic. If it's factual,

28:40.540 --> 28:47.100
it is not necessary. Is metaphysics supposed to be linguistic? No, say its advocates. Is

28:47.100 --> 28:52.780
metaphysics supposed to be contingent then? No, say its advocates. Well, then says Hume,

28:52.780 --> 29:00.940
metaphysics as such is out into the fire with it. There is no room for any such subject.

29:01.980 --> 29:05.820
If you come and say to Hume, but what about existence exists?

29:08.140 --> 29:14.940
A is A. Consciousness is the faculty for perceiving reality. Every event has a cause,

29:14.940 --> 29:18.940
he would say to you. Do you mean those propositions as expression of your arbitrary

29:19.020 --> 29:23.180
linguistic usage? You would say certainly not. I mean those to be facts of reality.

29:23.980 --> 29:29.580
He would say, did you arrive at them by sensory perception and do you regard them as simply

29:29.580 --> 29:35.820
contingent truths? You say certainly not. Those are laws and principles of reality. Say no such

29:35.820 --> 29:43.820
category. It's either a subjective relation of ideas, or it is a brute contingent sensualist

29:43.820 --> 29:49.500
type fact. Therefore, as far as metaphysics is concerned, throw it into the fire.

29:52.300 --> 29:57.500
A viewpoint echoed in the 20th century by many schools who are simply neo-Humia.

29:59.180 --> 30:06.780
The upshot in Hume's viewpoint is this. If you are certain about a proposition, if you understand

30:06.780 --> 30:13.580
why it must be true, if it's really reliable, it's detached from reality. And on the other hand,

30:13.580 --> 30:19.420
if it has something to say about the real world, you can't be certain about it and you can't make

30:19.420 --> 30:25.980
any sense of it. If you know it must be true, then it's not about the world. It says nothing about

30:25.980 --> 30:31.900
facts, it just expresses linguistic conventions. If it says something about facts, then it is

30:31.900 --> 30:40.060
contingent, uncertain, unreliable. If you prove it by experience, it's contingent and unreliable.

30:40.060 --> 30:46.460
If you prove it by logic, it simply is an arbitrary convention. So you're trapped either way.

30:46.460 --> 30:51.660
You cannot win, you end up in a complete skepticism.

30:53.580 --> 31:01.100
Now let us look briefly at some final topics from Hume, which we can race through briefly because

31:01.100 --> 31:09.580
the essence of his philosophy you now know. Human God. Well, of course, God cannot survive

31:09.660 --> 31:17.180
on a Humean philosophy. God is supposed to be a spiritual substance who is the cause of the world.

31:18.060 --> 31:23.820
Well, every item in that statement is gone. There is no world, no spiritual substance,

31:23.820 --> 31:33.660
and no causality. And consequently, God is out. And Hume takes great delight in demolishing God.

31:33.660 --> 31:37.020
He's particularly interested in the argument from design. You know, the

31:37.900 --> 31:45.900
reader's digest teleological argument. And he loves to take on religious people and make mincemeat

31:45.900 --> 31:52.300
of their viewpoint. Now there are passages in Hume which indicate that religion is still a sensitive

31:52.300 --> 31:58.460
subject in his opinion and that he is loath to come out as a complete atheist, but obviously any

31:58.460 --> 32:04.380
belief in God would be completely incompatible with his philosophy. In essence, his view would be

32:04.380 --> 32:11.020
that God as a term is radically different from anything a sensualist can come in contact with,

32:11.020 --> 32:16.620
and therefore it's simply a meaningless noise. And therefore, Hume is essentially anti-religious.

32:18.460 --> 32:24.620
If you read his detailed arguments, I may say you would find them a mixture of astute

32:25.260 --> 32:30.380
objections. He's a fairly good polemicist, but he's always a Humean and to untangle

32:30.940 --> 32:35.340
his good objections from his crazy Humeanism, which are all mashed together.

32:36.620 --> 32:39.420
It's easier to refute God on your own without help from Hume.

32:43.580 --> 32:51.980
Now, the effects of Hume's assault on God were that, combined with other influences, he was only

32:51.980 --> 32:59.660
one, but he contributed heavily to the fact that after this period, no influential philosopher

33:00.220 --> 33:05.980
attempted to prove the existence of God in reason. Kant was very religious, but he did not think

33:05.980 --> 33:15.420
you could prove God in reason. Hegel, well, Hegel is Hegel, and his God is hardly the same as anybody

33:15.420 --> 33:22.380
else's God. Nietzsche said correctly in the 19th century, God is dead, meaning religion was a

33:22.380 --> 33:28.780
dead issue. And in the 20th century, one whole school derivative from Hume and Kant says that

33:28.780 --> 33:36.940
God is simply a noise like gloop. It stands for nothing at all. And another school says that

33:36.940 --> 33:43.100
if you do believe in God, you have to go by absurd feelings because God is not graspable by reason.

33:43.980 --> 33:51.900
So God never survived the 18th century philosophically. He never again had the importance

33:51.900 --> 33:59.420
that he did in Descartes' Bonot's Alarmus Locke Barclay. Now, there are people who think that this

33:59.420 --> 34:07.020
is good, and that Hume has done a great service combined with a few other philosophers in getting

34:07.020 --> 34:15.340
rid of God. I would not agree with that. Because as an objectivist, I would say the concept of God

34:15.340 --> 34:25.500
is bad because it is anti-reason and anti-reality. But in Hume, God is thrown out along with reason

34:25.500 --> 34:32.940
and reality on the same grounds. And this is a very, very bad mixture. Now, I remember once

34:32.940 --> 34:39.980
talking to a brash sophomore, this was 20 years ago, and I asked him if he believed in God.

34:40.540 --> 34:49.900
And he said, of course not. God doesn't exist. Nothing does. Now, that is the Humean mentality.

34:51.020 --> 34:57.180
And it helps to explain to you why it is a mistake to call objectivism atheism.

34:57.820 --> 35:05.340
Objectivists are atheists. We deny the existence of God. But all sorts of people deny the existence

35:05.340 --> 35:11.340
of God, including Hume and the Communists for different reasons. And therefore, to know that

35:11.340 --> 35:17.980
somebody is an atheist is to tell you nothing about the essence of his philosophy. It simply

35:17.980 --> 35:23.660
tells you that there is one aberration he did not commit. But that leaves open a terrific field.

35:26.380 --> 35:33.340
Now, on ethics, to say a word about Hume's view on that question, it should be obvious

35:33.900 --> 35:39.420
that his ethics is compatible with the rest of his philosophy. In other words, it is a thoroughly

35:39.420 --> 35:49.820
skeptical subjectivist ethics. The question he raises is, how can you ever defend an ethical

35:49.820 --> 35:57.340
or evaluative proposition? If we have to base everything on experience, experience only tells

35:57.340 --> 36:03.820
us what is the case? How do we ever get a knowledge of what ought to be the case?

36:05.580 --> 36:16.300
Did you ever touch a desirability? Did you ever smell a goodness? Obviously, valued terms. You cannot

36:16.300 --> 36:22.540
grasp or imbibe through the senses or images. And if that is our only means of cognition,

36:22.540 --> 36:28.860
there is obviously no way to validate value premises. So here we have the old problem of

36:28.860 --> 36:35.420
deriving values from facts. And of course, Hume declares it can't be done. In fact, there's a

36:35.420 --> 36:42.940
parallel here. Just as he claims, you can't get a must out of an is. You can't get a necessary

36:42.940 --> 36:49.580
connection out of a fact. So he says, you can't get an evaluation out of an is. You can't get an

36:49.660 --> 36:57.180
ought out of it is. You can't get a value out of a fact. And therefore, value judgments are

36:57.180 --> 37:06.140
gratuitously arbitrary in their foundation. No rational ethics is possible. Ethics must begin

37:06.140 --> 37:12.060
with subjective desires and feelings. And when we say something is right or some equivalent value

37:12.060 --> 37:19.980
term, we ultimately must mean that is what we desire. Ethics is a matter of feeling.

37:22.860 --> 37:28.060
Reason therefore says Hume is and must be a slave of the passions.

37:30.700 --> 37:38.860
In other words, we have again, essentially the softest viewpoint in ethics. Now there's nothing

37:38.940 --> 37:44.460
new, therefore, in his ethics. It's the same skepticism as in the rest of his philosophy.

37:45.420 --> 37:50.140
And the answer to his specific charge that you cannot get values out of fact is contained.

37:50.940 --> 37:53.820
Well, it's contained in Galt's speech, and it's also in the

37:54.620 --> 37:58.860
objectivist ethics, the essay by Ms. Rand. So I won't comment on that further.

38:01.420 --> 38:05.580
To summarize Hume's philosophy, I think the best thing is to let him summarize.

38:06.300 --> 38:13.420
This is a quote from him in which he expresses his arch skepticism, quote. I read you these

38:13.420 --> 38:18.700
because they're famous and explicit. And because he's British, they're intelligible, quote.

38:20.540 --> 38:25.740
"'Tis not solely in poetry and music, we must follow our taste and sentiment,

38:25.740 --> 38:31.660
but likewise in philosophy. When I am convinced of any principle,

38:31.660 --> 38:38.380
it is only an idea which strikes more strongly upon me. When I give the preference to one set

38:38.380 --> 38:45.100
of arguments above another, I do nothing but decide from my feeling concerning the superiority

38:45.100 --> 38:52.860
of their influence. Objects have no discoverable connection together, nor is it from any other

38:52.860 --> 38:59.340
principle but custom operating upon the imagination that we can draw any inference from the appearance

38:59.340 --> 39:09.420
of one to the existence of another.'" In other words, nobody can know anything. This is arch,

39:09.420 --> 39:17.260
complete skepticism, absolute bankruptcy, philosophy, idea, science, theory, it's all a

39:17.260 --> 39:22.700
matter of taste and feeling. Now you say you can't live by this philosophy,

39:24.460 --> 39:29.100
and you think that that is an objection to Hume. Well, you may or may not be surprised to

39:29.100 --> 39:36.860
know that Hume agrees with you. He says quite explicitly, no, you cannot live by this philosophy.

39:37.580 --> 39:42.300
He says in a famous passage, which I won't take the time to read, but what it amounts to is that

39:42.860 --> 39:49.420
he writes this material showing that external world is meaningless and self is meaningless

39:49.420 --> 39:55.180
and causality is meaningless and so on. Then he says he leaves his writing and he goes and dines

39:55.260 --> 40:03.180
with friends, he plays a game of backgammon, he uses that example, and he lives in the normal

40:03.180 --> 40:09.820
world with everybody else, and then he says he comes back and reads what he wrote, and it seems

40:09.820 --> 40:17.580
to him so strained and ridiculous he wants to throw it all out, but he can't find anything wrong with

40:17.580 --> 40:28.540
it. Why is his solution to this dilemma? The solution he says is skepticism is a disease

40:29.260 --> 40:37.340
that comes from living by reason, and the only way out is simply pay no attention to the conclusions

40:37.340 --> 40:45.420
of reason. Quote, this skeptical doubt, both with respect to reason and the senses, is a

40:45.420 --> 40:51.820
malady which can never be radically cured but must return upon us every moment, however we

40:51.820 --> 40:59.500
may chase it away. Carelessness and inattention, carelessness and inattention alone can afford

40:59.500 --> 41:09.980
us any remedy. For this reason, I rely entirely upon them and take it for granted whatever may

41:09.980 --> 41:14.700
be the reader's opinion at this present moment that an hour hence he will be persuaded that

41:14.700 --> 41:24.140
there is both an external and internal world. You get the idea. In other words, you cannot live by

41:24.140 --> 41:31.660
philosophy, you have to be careless and inattentive to it because you can't live by reason, and you

41:31.660 --> 41:40.060
do not have to, because we are not only rational creatures, we are also natural creatures, which

41:40.060 --> 41:47.900
means we have instincts, we have imaginations, we have feelings, and our feelings and imaginations

41:47.900 --> 41:54.780
and instincts will invent the fictions we need and will take us through life prosperously as long

41:54.780 --> 42:01.020
as we pay no attention to reason and philosophy. If you think you've got a reason for believing what

42:01.020 --> 42:08.140
you do, you haven't. Your actual, the actual, I can't even say cause because there are no causes,

42:08.140 --> 42:17.420
but the actual something or other of your beliefs is simply instinct, quote, famous line of humor.

42:17.420 --> 42:25.260
If we believe that fire warms or water refreshes, it is only because it costs us too much pains

42:25.260 --> 42:34.060
to think otherwise, unquote. Now there's just a pragmatic matter of instinct. In other words,

42:34.060 --> 42:42.700
in the last analysis, irrational, unphilosophical, unthinking, blind, instinct is superior to reason,

42:42.700 --> 42:50.380
thought, and philosophy. That's the final upshot of humans philosophy. Reason is impotent, nobody

42:50.380 --> 42:57.100
can know anything. Reason can't give you a knowledge of reality. External reality is a myth, entities

42:57.100 --> 43:03.260
are a myth, the self is a myth, cause and effect is a myth, logic is a subjective construction,

43:03.260 --> 43:09.020
nobody has any reason to believe anything. You can live only if you ignore reason and function by

43:09.020 --> 43:15.900
irrational instinct, only if you throw a reason and philosophy into the fire and follow your irrational

43:15.900 --> 43:22.300
passions. Now you see this is the end result of trying to philosophize, having invalidated

43:23.020 --> 43:27.980
the conceptual faculty. And one of two things had to happen at this point.

43:28.780 --> 43:36.540
Either a champion of reason in a valid sense had to appear, somebody who finally validated

43:36.540 --> 43:45.020
man's conceptual faculty, or the arch destroyer of all time would appear and put the final seal

43:45.020 --> 43:52.380
on man's philosophic demise. And the second, of course, is what happened. The man who came on

43:52.380 --> 43:58.460
the scene right after Hume, who set himself the task of answering Hume, who said he was going to

43:58.460 --> 44:05.420
avoid the floating constructs of the rationalists and the skepticism of the empiricists, that man

44:05.420 --> 44:11.660
was Kant. And of course, in the process of giving his answers to these schools, he once and for all

44:11.660 --> 44:18.300
removed reason from the philosophic scene altogether. We have now traced the story from Greece,

44:18.860 --> 44:23.500
beginning with Thales and his friends eagerly trying for the first time to probe into the

44:23.500 --> 44:29.660
nature of reality. And we have gone now all the way through David Hume, where the attempt

44:29.660 --> 44:35.500
finally collapses with a sickening whimper. For tonight, that's it. Thank you very much.

44:35.500 --> 44:47.820
And how could Hume ask, can we conceive the opposite of the law of cause and effect,

44:47.820 --> 44:54.380
since it is a conception and it would be meaningless to begin with? No. The answer is by concept,

44:54.380 --> 45:00.300
he would mean form an image of. Can you form an image of the opposite of cause and effect?

45:00.300 --> 45:05.020
And he and his followers would say, yes, you could. You can form an image of an event without a

45:05.020 --> 45:12.060
cause, namely, for instance, the apple I mentioned during the lecture. And as long as you could image

45:12.060 --> 45:20.300
it for them, that's forming a concept of. How would Hume deal with 100% predictability? For

45:20.300 --> 45:25.260
instance, a certain mass of rock thrown with a certain force will always break a window made a

45:25.260 --> 45:32.060
certain way. Hume would say, you have no way whatever of knowing this. All you would know is that

45:32.060 --> 45:38.780
up to now, that kind of rock has behaved this way, but you haven't got one reason in a million

45:38.780 --> 45:43.660
to believe that it's going to behave that way in the future. So he would simply say, I don't

45:43.660 --> 45:51.180
account for 100% predictability. There is no even 1% predictability. Of course, he's wrong,

45:51.180 --> 46:00.220
but that's what he would say. By Hume's premises, how can our past experiences cause us to form a

46:00.220 --> 46:07.580
habit and hence arrive at our false idea of cause? A good question, no answer to it. Hume

46:07.580 --> 46:15.420
throughout gives causal explanations, alleged causal explanations of our false beliefs, our

46:15.420 --> 46:21.660
belief in entities and the self and the external world and so on. Having denied causality,

46:21.660 --> 46:26.780
he has no business giving such explanations, a point which is commonly made in polemics against

46:27.420 --> 46:31.420
and therefore he has to say that our belief in causality, if he's consistent,

46:32.300 --> 46:41.500
like causality itself, like any phenomenon of the world, is simply an inexplicable,

46:41.500 --> 46:48.140
brute, unintelligible, contingent fact which he can't make a header tailor. And in falling

46:48.140 --> 46:54.460
into the tendency to give a causal explanation of our mistaken belief in causality, he is using

46:54.460 --> 46:58.220
causality while denying it and thereby contradicting his own philosophy.

47:00.940 --> 47:09.660
If you ask Hume to put his hand, yes, in a fire a few times, and see if this would be the time

47:09.660 --> 47:17.820
his hand wouldn't be burned, would he do it? Assuming not what would be his reason. Undoubtedly,

47:17.820 --> 47:23.260
he wouldn't do it and he would say because he's a creature of instinct. Being a creature of instinct,

47:23.260 --> 47:29.820
he is conditioned to expect irrationally that the flame would burn him and he prefers to live by

47:29.820 --> 47:39.020
his irrational instinct. If Hume has to fall back on the concept of natural creatures with

47:39.020 --> 47:44.220
instincts, emotions, and so on, doesn't he necessarily refute his original impurities

47:44.220 --> 47:50.860
premise of no innate ideas? If so, didn't he see this and offer any explanation? Well,

47:50.860 --> 48:00.780
you must understand that for Hume, instincts, emotions, etc., are part of the impressions

48:00.780 --> 48:08.860
we are directly given. Just as we are directly given the simple ideas, those include certain

48:08.860 --> 48:15.820
emotions, passions, and feelings which for Hume do not derive from our ideas or from our intellect

48:15.900 --> 48:21.740
at all. They are simply irreducible primaries. They are part of our given empirical equipment

48:22.620 --> 48:29.740
and therefore he feels no compulsion to offer any explanation of emotions. Emotions are simply

48:29.740 --> 48:36.860
there. Whatever emotions we have, we have and that's it. They are raw elements like sensations with no

48:36.860 --> 48:41.740
further explanation offered. Of course, since he offers no explanation of anything, it shouldn't

48:41.740 --> 48:48.140
surprise you that he offers no explanation of emotions either. Why did certain philosophers

48:48.140 --> 48:53.420
develop a preference for certain psychological processes, namely sensation and perceptions,

48:53.420 --> 48:58.620
which stay out to be valid or meaningful and reject as meaningless or non-existent other

48:58.620 --> 49:03.500
psychological processes such as conceptualization and understanding whose existence are equally

49:03.500 --> 49:09.900
identifiable introspectively? Well, I tried to explain that in the process of giving the course.

49:11.820 --> 49:21.260
They believed that concepts were not based on reality and therefore they simply reconstrued

49:21.260 --> 49:30.140
what is in fact available introspectively. If it'll make you feel better to think of that

49:30.140 --> 49:34.140
noise coming from the next room, it's simply a secondary quality and therefore it's not really

49:34.140 --> 49:44.620
real. In other words, concepts do pose a certain problem that percepts don't. I'm not saying that

49:44.620 --> 49:51.660
the conclusions of philosophers are valid, but concepts are not directly perceivable in reality

49:51.660 --> 49:58.380
the way percepts are. Percepts represent a direct contact with reality. Concepts an indirect contact

49:59.020 --> 50:03.740
and therefore if a philosopher says, yes, I can grasp perception but I don't know what

50:03.740 --> 50:10.220
conception is, it represents to be sure a profound default on his philosophic tasks

50:10.220 --> 50:15.020
since the essence of philosophy is the theory of concepts, but on the face of it it is more

50:15.020 --> 50:20.300
intelligible and if you were to say I grasp concepts but I deny percepts because percepts

50:20.300 --> 50:27.740
are much simpler and easier to grasp and in this sense I would offer that as a partial explanation.

50:28.380 --> 50:34.940
But the full story is of course the whole nominalist argumentation.
