00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
Ayn Rand is one of the most provocative voices of the 20th century.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,200
Her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrug have earned her fame for their popularity

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,040
and notoriety for their content.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,600
In her many essays, public lectures, radio and television interviews, Ayn Rand offered

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,360
a unique perspective on a wide range of philosophical problems.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,480
Yet academic philosophers, both in her time and hours, have responded to her work largely

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,440
with derision and dismissal.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,240
What explains this attitude by professional philosophers?

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,800
Why do they routinely dismiss Ayn Rand?

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,840
Welcome to New Ideal Live, the podcast of the Ayn Rand Institute.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,480
I'm Aaron Smith, a fellow instructor at ARI.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Joining me today is ARI associate fellow Mike Mazum.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,160
Now, Mike, in your article, Why Can't Professional Philosophers Get Ayn Rand Right?

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,160
You address this question.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,920
And I wanted to spend some time talking with you about the article and about the case you

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,840
make in that article, because I think it's an important case.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,800
And I want to just read a quote from that article.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,960
You say, until professional philosophers engage with Rand's actual arguments, their

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,640
pat dismissal of her philosophy remains an unprofessional prejudice.

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
End quote.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
For those who may not have read the article, can you give us some kind of an overview of

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,040
what that article is about and what you're arguing in it?

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Yeah, thanks, Aaron.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:39,640
So there are dozens of criticisms of Rand floating out there, dozens as probably an understatement.

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:50,320
And part of what we do at ARI and part of what I see myself as doing is advocating, expanding

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,800
on and teaching about Rand's philosophy.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,080
So part of that means responding to criticisms.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,160
And many of the criticisms that are floating out there have responses to them in the Objectivist

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,840
secondary literature in podcasts on websites.

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,880
What I wanted to do in the article was to draw attention to a thread or a through line

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:26,640
that characterizes most of these criticisms, particularly the ones that are coming from

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,440
professional philosophy.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,720
If you have been in philosophy classes as an undergraduate and discussed I and Rand with

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:43,040
your professors, you probably get some version of she's not serious, she's not a philosopher.

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,720
Her arguments are lame, bad, weak.

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,760
And if they even concede that she has arguments at all, there's more than a few who would

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,040
just say she doesn't even argue for her position.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,480
She takes these controversial positions, but she won't give arguments for them.

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,360
What she'll do is she'll write a mean character who has a view that she doesn't like and make

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,800
them look stupid and then the view that she does like looks heroic in another character.

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,800
So why do they have this attitude?

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:25,440
Why do they have this such a strong and impassioned rejection of her?

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,400
It's a kind of puzzle that a lot of her fans have, why am I getting this hostility from

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,360
my professors because I like these ideas?

45
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:46,360
And also why can't my professors seem to criticize the views that I think I agree with?

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:54,680
Is the accusation of straw manning Rand is a common kind of response to these criticisms?

47
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:05,360
So what I do in the article is go through some of the criticisms that are sort of viral

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,380
in the Rand fan world, that's the Mike Cumers criticisms that I discuss have been floating

49
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,300
around the internet for decades.

50
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,100
And also criticisms from people in philosophy who are prominent, even if I don't think they're

51
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:28,780
good criticisms or even criticisms that have a lot of viewership, they're still notable

52
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,100
because of the stature of the people in the profession.

53
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:41,800
So what I did in the article is made the case that there's a feature that all of these arguments,

54
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,080
all of these criticisms have in common that fans of Rand and people who maybe aren't Rand

55
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,300
fans but are just kind of interested in objectivism as a cultural phenomenon haven't noticed

56
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,600
or aren't aware of.

57
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,340
So a lot of the responses to the criticisms that I discuss, for example, the responses

58
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,880
to Mike Humer or the responses to Robert Nozick, take the criticisms as given and just you've

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,780
got in respond by saying, well, you haven't correctly characterized her in this way or

60
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
that way.

61
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,880
What I'm trying to do is not reply directly to these criticisms but show that these criticisms

62
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:29,920
stem from some a wrong approach to the project of understanding and criticizing Rand and

63
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,020
that's the what I call philosophical procalism.

64
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,760
One of the things that I noticed from your article is that you don't take the tack that

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,640
I think a lot of people take is they look at this some sort of mis-presentation of one

66
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,280
of Iron Man's arguments and they say, well, this is dishonest, this is obviously dishonest.

67
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,120
And even if there is an element of dishonesty there sometimes, it's I think that's not the

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,400
tack you take in this article.

69
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,320
And so we're going to look at the issue of what you call philosophical parochialism and

70
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,900
sort of unpack that.

71
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,980
But just I don't know for motivations point like what who cares what these academics think?

72
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,140
I mean, you mentioned people like Brian Leiter and now many people in the audience might

73
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,980
not know who these people are, but these are all academic philosophers of mixed prominence.

74
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,260
Some are quite prominent, some are less like maybe semi prominent, but Brian Leiter, Masimo

75
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,700
Piliucci, I've written about him before, James Rachel's, Robert Nozick and you mentioned

76
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,460
Michael Humer.

77
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,440
Why do you think it's important to respond to these critics?

78
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
And I think in particularly the way you do.

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,360
So one thing to say is that part of advocating a radical philosophy is you look at the criticisms,

80
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
you think them through, respond to them.

81
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,960
That's part of your job as an advocate of controversial ideas.

82
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,800
So it just so happens that as bad as I think some of these criticisms are, they're not

83
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:10,380
all terrible, but as bad as some of them are, they're about as good as you'll find anywhere.

84
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,260
So if you look at the kind of criticisms you see in more popular presentations, popular

85
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:25,180
books, not academics, but public intellectuals who aren't academics, you get the much more

86
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,120
cruder.

87
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,160
She thinks Rand hates the poor.

88
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,280
She wants to industrialize a moral hero.

89
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Yeah.

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,760
So if you're rich, that means you're great, like that kind of that level.

91
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,840
And what the even the bad article or bad arguments from the professional philosophers do is try

92
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,440
to, you know, how is Rand reasoning about this and where is it wrong?

93
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,160
That's what they're at least attempting to do or claiming to do.

94
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,340
They happen to be the best you find out there.

95
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:08,980
Now the other reason to do that is most people who have an impact on the culture at large

96
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:17,380
go to college and some, you know, most people take some sort of philosophy class, whether

97
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,560
it's a introduction to philosophy or whether it's just like an ethics business ethics.

98
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,080
And that's where you're introduced to different ways of thinking about philosophical issues

99
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,640
if you, if you don't learn about them on your own.

100
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,200
And in those textbooks and in those classrooms, it's the professionals who get discussed.

101
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,960
And when Rand comes up and I go through in the article, some textbook presentations of

102
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:51,420
Rand, it's always or almost always a hatchet job, a misrepresentation, or just, just, you

103
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,700
know, that's a attributing some motives to the people doing this.

104
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,420
It's just incompetence.

105
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,060
They just can't accurately portray her.

106
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
They won't quote her.

107
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,940
They'll say Rand says this, they won't give a quote, they won't give a citation.

108
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,900
Or they'll say, go read James Rachel's on Iron Rand, you know, you don't have to read

109
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
her.

110
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,360
So let me just interject for a second, for the sake of the audience.

111
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,280
So you mentioned James Rachel's and they might not know who that is, but he wrote a book

112
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,240
called The Elements of Moral Philosophy and it's one of the most popular and widely used

113
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,320
introductions to ethics, at least in the US, I don't know how broadly that's said, but

114
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,540
at least in the US, it's very slender, brief presentations, concise presentations of different

115
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,960
major ethical positions, and it's just used all over the place.

116
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,660
So it's, you know, when you address James Rachel's, it's like, you might not know who

117
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,820
that is, but it's, it's the author of a widely used textbook that's just all over the place

118
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,180
in philosophy departments.

119
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,940
And so if you get a treatment that mangles Iron Rand in such a popular and widely used

120
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,660
textbook, I mean, a lot of eyes are on that piece.

121
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:04,140
So yeah, it's also, so it's one, it's one of the most popular textbook.

122
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,520
But I think it's in its 14th edition, something like that.

123
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,560
It's been around for quite some time and it's, even when it's not assigned, the other textbooks

124
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:24,600
that cite Rand are clearly taking their view of what Rand is saying from James Rachel's

125
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,720
presentation of her.

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,600
So it's, it's not, yeah, and I think also that, I mean, one of the major things is that

127
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,940
these mangled arguments, these mis-presentations of Rand's arguments that you get, lead people

128
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,940
to dismiss Iron Rand as a serious thinker.

129
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,060
And I think the more that happens, the more this matters, I think, to us who think that

130
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,820
her philosophic thought is new, original, really important, and to the extent to which

131
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,340
they go to professional philosophers, they read treatments by these people who are experts

132
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,960
in the field.

133
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,560
And their assessment, judging by their presentation, is, yeah, this is a pretty bad argument.

134
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,560
So she can't think straight and, you know, nothing to see here, kids.

135
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,160
And that, I think, is the overall impact of this.

136
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:25,320
Half the country goes to college, you think half of them take an ethics class, maybe three

137
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,160
quarters of them encounter Rand in their ethics textbooks.

138
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,500
She's discussed, to some degree, in a lot of the ethics textbooks.

139
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,940
And they think, this is it, like, they come in with no opinion.

140
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,220
I've heard of her, she's, you know, whatever.

141
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,460
And this is it, this is all there is to it, this is nothing.

142
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,700
And then, you know, you don't have infinite time in your life to go explore everything.

143
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,420
So you just dismiss her and then look back, yeah.

144
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:59,140
So it's important to address these, these kind of criticisms.

145
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:06,160
Even though it's easy to dismiss academics as off in the ivory tower, I mean, they have

146
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,560
an impact on each subsequent generation just through the fact that everyone goes to college.

147
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Yeah.

148
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Okay.

149
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
So fair enough.

150
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
So let's, let's get into the parochialism here.

151
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,160
So this is your main sort of claim in the article that one of the reasons why, a major

152
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,980
reason why academic philosophers don't get her arguments right is because there's something

153
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,020
like a certain kind of parochialism going on.

154
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,500
Can you say what parochialism is and how it's, how do you think it's operating?

155
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,260
I mean, for the full treatment, you can read the article, but just what, what do you want

156
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
to bring out here?

157
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Right.

158
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:49,620
So you're being parochial if you're assuming your own and projecting onto someone else

159
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,280
your own sort of views on the subject, assuming they agree with you on, on, on what you're

160
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,920
discussing and in philosophy.

161
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:08,440
So if you're discussing a philosophical theory, it's assuming concepts, definitions, views

162
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,880
of what philosophy is and how it argues when you're approaching a figure who's disputing

163
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,120
that.

164
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,260
So if you're reading Ayn Rand or if you're reading Heidegger from the German tradition

165
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,940
and you're an American 20th, 21st century mainstream academic and you read them and

166
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,420
you're just assuming that they must be interested in the same problems, 20th century American

167
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,380
academics are interested in, that they share the same definitions, that they, they share

168
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,180
the same methods and standards, that's a parochial approach to them.

169
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:48,440
You have to understand that people in different philosophical or historical contexts just

170
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,000
have different, different interests, different definitions, different standards of, for what

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,240
they're doing.

172
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,000
And part of interpreting them objectively is not imposing on them your own parochial

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,320
assumptions.

174
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,000
And my, my basic argument is that this is how Rand is being approached.

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,740
And I give an example in the article of a philosopher, Massimo Piliucci, who's criticizing

176
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,700
Rand on, on, on her metaphysics.

177
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,420
And he's, she, she defines a metaphysical concept axiom one way, and he just says, no,

178
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,500
that's not how we define it, and my response is, yeah, that's not how you define it.

179
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,380
Yeah, we, who's we, yeah, who's we, that's how you define it in the philosophy you're

180
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,720
familiar with.

181
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,640
But philosophical terms and definitions are, I mean, there are things people argue over.

182
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,940
What's the right way to define justice?

183
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,000
What's the right way to define freedom?

184
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,560
What's the right way to define axiom is the concept in question.

185
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,680
And to just assume, well, this is the way my people define, yeah, that's what's in dispute.

186
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
We're disputing.

187
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
There's a, there's a different way to think about it.

188
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,200
And Rand's saying hers is superior or correct.

189
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,180
And you're not going to, you're not going to decide who's right by just asserting your,

190
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
your side.

191
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,540
So that's a pretty crude version of it.

192
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,540
That's why I start with it just to familiarize the reader with what it looks like.

193
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,620
But there's more, as the article goes on, we go into more complex versions of this, assuming

194
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,020
that Rand must be arguing a certain way because, well, how else would you argue?

195
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,360
That's how we argue in 20th century academic philosophy.

196
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,580
Not being sensitive to act that she argues a different way.

197
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,580
Yeah.

198
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,420
So I want to ask you about the sort of form of argument that they think is, I don't know,

199
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,260
the gold standard, like how you're supposed to properly argue as a philosopher.

200
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,140
But just to come back to Massimo Piliucci, I mean, just to read that, there's a real

201
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,940
unseriousness on his part toward Rand, a real contempt for his subject.

202
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,340
So it's, you know, he quotes, like, as you say in the article, he quotes, he quotes

203
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,840
some statement by Ein Rand, which says something about an axiom, but it's not a definition

204
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
of the axiom.

205
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,760
So he leaves out the definition of an axiom, leaves in the quote, whereas he just characterizes

206
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,520
some aspect of it and says, this is what she, how she defines an axiom, wrong.

207
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,400
He says, oh, you know, without even like doing a little mini minor due diligence and just

208
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,240
kind of like, so where does she write about this?

209
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
How does she define this?

210
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
What?

211
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
It's just, there's none of that.

212
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,540
This is obviously wrong.

213
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
This is obviously silly.

214
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,260
And it just, that's not what it is.

215
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,180
An axiom is what, what do you say, a premise where you start a discussion or something

216
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,300
like that, and it's like something you take for granted in a discussion.

217
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:50,380
And like, there's no investigation, no thought as she have a different conception of what

218
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,580
an axiom and what is that?

219
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,740
And what do I think of it?

220
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,500
And there's just none of it.

221
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,300
Well, we'll come, we'll come back to this, I'm sure.

222
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,920
But one of the things that's so frustrating about this is that, I mean, I put in the article

223
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,800
and you just said, these, a lot of these people writing about Rand obviously have contempt

224
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,720
for her. And it's actually possible to have contempt for a figure you're discussing and

225
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,920
not misrepresent them.

226
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,160
This happens all the time in good philosophical, historical scholarship.

227
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,840
You're discussing a figure, you think, yeah, their views are really wrong and really bad,

228
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,660
really evil.

229
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,700
And I can write a paper about it and not caricature them or misrepresent them.

230
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,260
So there's, there's a lot of things going on.

231
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,180
And that, that case is especially, a lot of things, a lot of the things that are going

232
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,100
on are especially obvious in that case.

233
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,300
Yeah.

234
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,260
And so part of it, I think is stemming from this, just there's a contempt for the subject,

235
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:53,100
which leads to a cavalier, unserious treatment of the subject, which then leads to

236
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,720
wide, just common errors, gross misrepresentations, things like, it's hard to take

237
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,320
seriously. And I mean, speaking for myself, like, I want to respond to these things.

238
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,680
And at some point it feels like, like you're flooding, swatting a fly, so to speak,

239
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,960
it's just sort of like, it's not worth the effort.

240
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,960
And yet you want to respond.

241
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And yet the criticism is so poor that it's, it's, it's kind of embarrassing to respond.

242
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,000
But not all these criticisms that you mentioned for sure in your article are of

243
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,740
that caliber where it's just so silly, like it's, it's going to be a bit embarrassing

244
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,980
to respond to it.

245
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,500
And you make the case that they're looking for a certain kind of argument.

246
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:41,420
They don't see it in Rand and they try to reconstruct it according to what they

247
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,780
think an argument should look like.

248
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,860
And then something goes awry there.

249
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,140
So maybe you can tell, tell us a bit about that.

250
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,860
Maybe I hope I'm not mischaracterizing that.

251
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,260
No, that's, that's, that's fair.

252
00:18:51,260 --> 00:19:03,440
So there's a standard that philosophy, or I should say, philosophers in the kind of

253
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,800
Anglo-American, what's sometimes called analytic tradition, that they, they want

254
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,960
their craft to aspire to.

255
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,640
And it's sort of like the standards of rigor in mathematics, where you can put

256
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:25,140
down certain propositions and then prove as a matter of formal deductive necessity

257
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,260
that some controversial conclusion follows from them or some, some important

258
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,980
conclusion follows from them.

259
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,660
And that's now people in that tradition are aware that that's really hard to do to, to

260
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,780
find it, knock down argument that just follows as a matter of pure formalism.

261
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,400
Like you think of, if you've taken a logic class and you write down like symbols, you

262
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,280
turn an English sentence into a string of symbols and prove something about it.

263
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,080
That's really hard to do.

264
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,240
It almost never happens, but that's a kind of standard we can try to approximate that.

265
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,960
And if you have that view as a kind of, well, this is what a good philosophical

266
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,000
argument looks like.

267
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,040
And it's not as bad as it used to be, but there was a period of time where, you know,

268
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,420
if you looked in a philosophy journal, this is 60s, 70s, 80s kind of, you'd see a lot

269
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,940
of articles, yeah, when Einren was writing, you'd see articles on, you think it's an

270
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,180
ethics article, oh, okay, this is going to be very, you know, how to live your life,

271
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,820
what's a virtue, what's a vice, what's a good, and you instead, you get analyses of

272
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,820
the logical structure of sentences that has the, have the word ought in it.

273
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,480
And there's a whole bunch of symbolic logic, is that what does this have to do with, that's

274
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,240
the way people were thinking and writing at the time.

275
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,720
And that still goes on to a lesser degree today.

276
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,640
A lot of the criticisms that I'm responding to originated in this time period and kind

277
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,800
of just have been repeated without any reflection since then.

278
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:08,440
And if that's your view of what good philosophy looks like, and that's your view of not just,

279
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,620
that's what good philosophy looks like, but that's just what philosophy looks like.

280
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,220
And then you approach Rand, you read one of her articles, and she's not arguing that way

281
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,740
at all, like she rejects arguing that way, she thinks that's a bad way to argue,

282
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,540
it's never going to get you anywhere, it's not going to get you to the truth.

283
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,460
There's a question of what do I make of this?

284
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,500
And if you went to graduate school during that period of time, you might not even know

285
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,600
that there are other ways people reason and argue, you might not have learned that.

286
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,720
And you might not see that major figures in the history of philosophy are arguing that way

287
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,000
because it's hard to parse an interesting philosophical argument and see what its parts are.

288
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:07,140
So my conclusion is that a lot of the more sophisticated criticisms are trying

289
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:13,500
to take something resembling what Rand says in her published essays and like shoehorn them

290
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:22,580
into this premise, premise, conclusion structure of reasoning that the profession values.

291
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,760
And that's just not how she's arguing.

292
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,480
And you make a case in the, I mean, I'm not, I take it you don't have any problem

293
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,720
with putting together premises and conclusions.

294
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,480
I mean, one of the things that you do when you look in an article is what are the points

295
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,120
that are adduced that are intended by the author to support or give evidence for

296
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,480
or plausibility for a conclusion?

297
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,660
I think obviously we're not saying anything negative against that, but there's a particular kind

298
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,400
of deductive structure that they're trying to, they don't find in Ayn Rand.

299
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,720
So part of it is they think, well, she doesn't really have arguments because they don't find that.

300
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,740
And then part of it is, well, she doesn't really have arguments, but let's see if we can put it

301
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,980
in a deductive form so where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.

302
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,400
And then you're saying that's often not what you find in Rand's work.

303
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
And you give an argument in the piece.

304
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,720
I don't know how much you want to talk about this, but her argument.

305
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,720
No, just as a point of evidence in favor of this as an interpretation of what they're doing.

306
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,080
This is what Robert Nozick says he's doing, like explicitly.

307
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,640
He starts his article saying, yeah, he starts his article saying, I'd like to reconstruct Rand's

308
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,020
argument as a deductive argument with premises and et cetera.

309
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,060
And then he says, I don't know what that is.

310
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,060
So I'm going to fill in the blanks for her.

311
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Yeah. And that was on the Randian argument.

312
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,300
That's on the Randian argument in 1971, or maybe 73.

313
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,780
Yeah. And that gets referred to a lot.

314
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Yeah. Just look at Nozick's takedown and on the Randian argument.

315
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,020
Again, that's the way these things function.

316
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:14,880
So it's not like those arguments have been given, in this case, there were responses,

317
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,440
contemporaneous responses to Nozick's on the Randian argument article.

318
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,240
And maybe you can mention some of those, but often it's just they stand as, yeah, just see,

319
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,960
just see Nozick or just see James Rachel's and that's already been taken care of.

320
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,880
And then that's part of the way.

321
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:42,180
There's an amusing exchange on one of the major professional philosophy blogs.

322
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,460
Somebody writes in and asks, what are the best academic criticisms of

323
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,540
Ayn Rand looking for like ammunition?

324
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,100
And there's a whole bunch of threads or a whole bunch of replies with, you know,

325
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,820
recognizable names replying.

326
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,860
And they come up with a whole lot of nothing except Robert Nozick's article.

327
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,320
And he starts the article saying, I don't really know how to accurately represent Rand's argument.

328
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,880
I'm going to give my own version of it.

329
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,960
So that's like the best they can do when they're when they're asked.

330
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,840
So that's, I mean, you asked earlier, why is this worth responding to?

331
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,360
Yeah, that's another reason worth responding to.

332
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,360
It's like, you'll go to your professors and ask them, what do you think about Ayn Rand?

333
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,440
And you'll get hostility.

334
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,680
And then like really ask them, like, what's a good response?

335
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,640
And if that's, yeah.

336
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:36,180
I think one of the really valuable things, I mean, about your article is that you take

337
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,060
the time to show what's how these arguments go wrong.

338
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,900
So it's Sidney Hook's famous criticism.

339
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,260
Robert Nozick's now famous article on the Randian argument.

340
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,980
James Rachel's widely popular treatment of Ayn Rand's egoism in his moral

341
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:03,480
philosophy textbook and to show that they go wrong, that they don't match Rand's

342
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:13,440
argument and then go on to say underlying why they, what's generating this, what's

343
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,760
the mistreatment of the mishandling of the argument, the mispresentation of the

344
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,960
argument is they have a kind of parochial view about what an argument looks like,

345
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,040
what philosophy, what it means to practice philosophy and they, as a result, they

346
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,180
don't find these kinds of arguments in her.

347
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,740
What kind of arguments do you find if you're not finding deductive arguments?

348
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,780
I mean, she obviously, well, you have people that say she makes no arguments.

349
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,500
Again, for someone who reads that and thinks, like, what are you talking about?

350
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,300
I think this also helps to see like they're looking for a specific kind of

351
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,020
thing when they're looking for an argument, they don't find it.

352
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,540
But does she make arguments, Mike?

353
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,040
Yeah, so read the article for the details, but in short summary, she does make

354
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,840
arguments, they're not the kind of arguments you find in math, they're more

355
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,680
like the kind of arguments you find in the sciences, they're explanatory arguments.

356
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:11,040
She's looking at some phenomenon about, so the example I give in the article is

357
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:17,040
her argument for egoism, she's looking to explain why we pursue values to begin with.

358
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,540
And then she's using that explanation to go on and give a further explanation.

359
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,940
So if this is why we pursue values to begin with, why do we need to pursue

360
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,540
values under the guidance of a systematic code?

361
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,540
So she gives a series of explanatory arguments.

362
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,540
It's more help, if you want to understand the form of the argument, like how she argues,

363
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:45,980
it would be more helpful to learn about explanation in the history of the

364
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,480
biology or something, than it would be to look at how math structures its arguments.

365
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,480
But the pattern in philosophy has been to look to math, not to the inductive sciences.

366
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,480
So yeah, for the details, you have to look at the article.

367
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Okay, so I think one of the values of the article, for people who are interested

368
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,480
in objectivism and frustrated by these kind of presentations of Rand's work,

369
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,980
I think this helps it go some distance in explaining what's behind it,

370
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:29,980
beyond other than or in addition to some kind of dishonesty or hostility toward Rand.

371
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,980
Because the hostility is real, whether or not that factors in the presentation of Rand or not.

372
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,980
I think sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.

373
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Like you mentioned, Nozick wasn't hostile to Rand and he was more sympathetic to her.

374
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,480
As far as you can tell, trying to present, to fairly present her case.

375
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Whereas other things are just kind of smears and it's not always like that, though it often is.

376
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,980
Yeah, I mean, I don't think Nozick is hostile.

377
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,480
I don't consider Mike Humor hostile.

378
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,480
So if we're thinking about, my question is why do professional philosophers,

379
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
why can't they get Rand right?

380
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:16,980
What I'm trying to do is give a major factor that people aren't aware of.

381
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,980
So if you really want the full answer to the question, it's like a multi-factor explanation.

382
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,980
So as we pointed out with Massimo Piliucci's criticism,

383
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,980
yeah, there's just some intellectual dishonesty here.

384
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,980
He's quoting her out of context.

385
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,480
He's kind of just crudely asserting his own view as if that in and of itself is a response to anything.

386
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,480
And the guy has three PhDs, like he knows what's wrong with that.

387
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:52,480
So that's certainly, you can't have a full understanding of why some academics reject her so strongly.

388
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Part of it is there's just some dishonesty.

389
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,480
But I mean, dishonesty doesn't exist in a vacuum.

390
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,980
So other relevant factors are there's hostility to her.

391
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,980
Moral and political views are that's certainly relevant to understanding why she's rejected.

392
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,980
Most philosophers are very left-wing.

393
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,980
That's certainly relevant.

394
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:25,980
They're all bought into altruism or just computer subjectivism as a moral framework.

395
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,480
So they're hostile to the egoism just as in so far as the content is concerned.

396
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,480
And then you have to see all of those things interacting with the prokulism.

397
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,480
So there couldn't possibly be a better argument for a good argument for capitalism.

398
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,480
I mean, I've read Nozick, I've read Milton Friedman.

399
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,480
She just has to be saying some other version of that.

400
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,480
And those arguments are dumb, so I don't need to bother taking her too seriously.

401
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,980
That's a kind of prokulism in and of itself.

402
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:08,980
And then if you are deep into Rand's philosophy, you'll be familiar with her claims.

403
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:17,980
You can't defend capitalism without a radical revision of your moral and epistemological views.

404
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:27,980
So that kind of factor interacts with the professor's rejection of the political views.

405
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
So these are all relevant factors.

406
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:37,980
And what I want to draw people's attention to is just this additional one that you might not have noticed.

407
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Yeah, because I think it's really non-obvious, particular to people who aren't in the field.

408
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,980
And there is a sense in which, so in graduate school often we're taught to...

409
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:55,980
So we both have PhDs in philosophy, so we spent time in academia and learning about what philosophic arguments are supposed to look like,

410
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,980
at least as we're taught, and you're often taught to sort of put things in standard form.

411
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,980
You put it in terms of premises in conclusion.

412
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,980
And often you'll read a piece that it's hard to do that with.

413
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
And it's not just on Rand.

414
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:15,980
So one of the most widely assigned pieces of reading in introductory philosophy courses,

415
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,980
or introductory ethics courses, is Plato's dialogue, Euthyphro,

416
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:28,980
where Socrates is talking to this guy named Euthyphro and part of what happens in the dialogue is that

417
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,980
he's questioning Euthyphro about his use of a particular concept and his understanding of it.

418
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Because his grasp of that concept is going to have an impact on how he functions in his life and on some important issue.

419
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:48,980
And as they sort of go around and through the discussion, it turns out, he doesn't really know what he's talking about.

420
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,980
He doesn't have a clear-headed notion of what kind of concept.

421
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,980
It's in this case, it's piety, but you could substitute it, like in many of his other dialogues,

422
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,980
it's justice, it's knowledge, and so on, courage.

423
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:09,980
And what he's pointing out is you don't have a clear view of what you mean by this concept, and yet you're functioning with it.

424
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:17,980
And it's part of your operating system, and yet it's clearly unsatisfactory, like in a significant way.

425
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,980
And you need to pay more attention to that.

426
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Now, it's very hard to put that in some sort of standard form, and I've seen professors try to do it, like as a TA in, of course, in ethics,

427
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,980
I saw professors do that, and it was, it misses most of what the dialogue is about.

428
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,980
It's like, yeah, Socrates is making this argument, and if you put it in this form, clearly the conclusion doesn't follow,

429
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,980
and so because there's all sorts of counter-examples, and this is silly, and what a dumb argument,

430
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:51,980
and it's like you miss the force of a really important philosophical dialogue that has resonance today.

431
00:33:51,980 --> 00:34:00,980
Like, I mean, I assigned, I teach Objectivism, I assigned the youth of Rome for its power and its impact and the point it makes,

432
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,980
and it's kind of, Rand is making something of a similar point in philosophy who needs it, and yet you miss it completely.

433
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,980
And that's just another example of this. This is how you're supposed to think about an argument.

434
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,980
You don't find it in there, let's shoehorn it into some kind of argument.

435
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,980
The argument doesn't really work very well. It doesn't really represent what's going on in that philosophical work.

436
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,980
And then you say, and then the students are going, yeah, well, Socrates is not much of a thinker.

437
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Well, I allude to this a little bit in the article where I make the point that the way Rand's arguing shouldn't be,

438
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,980
it's not as if she's got a completely out of left field new way to give a philosophical argument.

439
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Now, she's much better at it than the philosophers in the historical canon.

440
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,980
But other philosophers give explanatory arguments, including Plato.

441
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,980
I don't think they're good explanations, but that's how they're reasoning.

442
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:16,980
And one of the pieces of evidence to think that there's something unjust and dishonest about how Rand is discussed by academic philosophers

443
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:29,980
is if you really took the standards they're trying to apply to her and apply them to somebody like Descartes or Plato,

444
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,980
you'd have to say they're not good philosophers either.

445
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:41,980
They don't make the kind of rigorous deductive arguments that you look that the 20th century figures are looking for.

446
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:48,980
At least they don't always. The theories they're most well remembered for are not argued for in that way.

447
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:55,980
They're more argued for. The forums best explain certain things, like I cite the Fido in my article.

448
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:09,980
And if you really held yourself to that standard they're trying to impose on Rand, then none of these people are serious thinkers either.

449
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,980
And now they don't do that. So why not?

450
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,980
And that's where you have to factor in it.

451
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:23,980
One is just, well, we're supposed to think Plato is a good philosopher, so we don't raise these objections to him.

452
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,980
But also Rand's a right winger and we hate her for that.

453
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,980
And she's a capitalist and she says it's good to be selfish, so we hate her views too.

454
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,980
And again, all these factors interact.

455
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:44,980
But I mean, any time you see a kind of inconsistent application of a standard, and it's really strong evidence.

456
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
At least raises a flag.

457
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,980
Yeah, at least raises a flag. Yeah, there's several things going on here.

458
00:36:52,980 --> 00:37:05,980
One of which is just there's an injustice and the other of which is, you know, you have to dig into understanding that and that's part of what bringing out the prokulism of the approach does.

459
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
Okay.

460
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:21,980
So your article focuses mainly on the prokulism. And I think it's good that we did mention, you know, there are other factors going on, it's not just this but one thing is just like this is one factor that's not often seen or noticed.

461
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,980
And I think it's like,

462
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:34,980
maybe this is a bit of a side point, but can you say why you think it's important to flag that the issue of prokulism because I think about graduate students.

463
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
I think it's important now.

464
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:51,980
So, you take a standard sort of fan of I ran they read out the shrug they read the fountain head. They get inspired by the novels. In some cases it feels right quite liberating it's the, it gives them a framework that is empowering and so on.

465
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,980
And they read something like I ran is not really a philosopher arguments are all bad. And it doesn't.

466
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:07,980
But if you're actually studying philosophy or intellectual fields, and you come across these things, I think it's useful to note.

467
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:20,980
I think your articles worth reading, I think in part that I was just talking to somebody who was in political science. And she was saying, I, you know, I want to I want to see Rand's argument in deductive form and she wasn't critical.

468
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:32,980
She wasn't, she wasn't a criticism of critical mind renders just sort of like, that's what I'm looking for. And it's like that's what we're seeing effect taught to look for. And then if you don't see those you don't find those you start to think well maybe there's something to that criticism

469
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:39,980
maybe she just doesn't really make arguments or her arguments are bad. If you try to put them in deductive form and then it sort of mangles the argument.

470
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Yeah, I mean, Rand is saying philosophies not like that.

471
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:56,980
Yeah, say more about that because that's important because she rejects that method of argumentation, not just that she doesn't do things like professionals today do it.

472
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:05,980
And so there's some confusion, and she's saying, you guys don't know how to argue in philosophy. And I mean she thinks the field has collapsed.

473
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:16,980
The whole field of philosophy in fact, has collapsed in a in a fundamental way they're not, they're not forming systems anymore, predominantly.

474
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,980
And yeah, she thinks that there's a kind of dereliction of the field.

475
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:44,980
So to just to just indicate that that there's more going on here like you wouldn't say that about the origin of the species, or like Galileo's arguments for the for the for the sun being the center of the solar system.

476
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,980
You wouldn't say I can't put it in a deductive form.

477
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:57,980
So that means there's no arguments easy. Yeah, that's just not the sciences just aren't like that.

478
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:12,980
And Rand's saying something similar about philosophy is not like that it's not like math where maybe in math you can do that sort of thing saying no it's more like the sciences and is she right about that I mean that is a philosophical question.

479
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:19,980
What methods should philosophy use. What kind of subject is it.

480
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:26,980
And she's calling that into question and she's, she has her own way of thinking about it. And I mean even it.

481
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:36,980
She indicates that she's doing that in most of the major texts when she argues for egoism in the objectives ethics.

482
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:45,980
She starts the essay by talking about how the science of ethics should look how it should proceed what its questions are.

483
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:57,980
And why people have not like been able to see that she gives a whole argument that the first question of ethics is does man, what are values and does man need them.

484
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,980
That's not usually how you start ethics when you take intro to ethics that's not how it begins.

485
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:19,980
But she's got a different view and she's telling you she has a different view. And that's one of the, you know, one of the just indications that these critics commentators are approaching their, their subject with this populism is that she's

486
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:29,980
literally telling you that she's doing something different. And they just doesn't register they don't even acknowledge that she say they don't say, well she says she's doing something different which is really not.

487
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,980
It just goes in one ear at the other like it's not even there.

488
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:41,980
Yeah, and I think so one of the things I appreciated the most in my own graduate school and philosophy.

489
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:51,980
And I tried to emulate because I thought like this is the right way to approach a particular philosopher.

490
00:41:51,980 --> 00:42:10,980
Particularly when you disagree with them or don't understand him but it was usually him is to understand the philosopher in his own terms or on his own terms in the context of his times addressing the kinds of issues that person does so one of

491
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:20,980
things that's standard. And I think it's interesting that the philosophers that you mentioned in the article, predominantly are not historians of philosophy.

492
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:33,980
So I studied in departments where they had people and I tended to gravitate toward these people that are historians in philosophy, whether in ancient Greek philosophy or typically early modern where

493
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:39,980
it's like if you take Dick Hart says this and this and you put some premises and that's stupid. It's like none of them approach it like that.

494
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:47,980
They look at this and say what Dick Hart is doing is he's trying and they try to put it in a context. What are his own aims.

495
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:56,980
How does he think philosophy should properly function how do you think you should argue why does he take these premises which seems strange to us for granted.

496
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:08,980
Why doesn't he question these other things which we think are obviously questionable. And it's taking the philosopher seriously like yeah no there's a reason why he doesn't question these things.

497
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,980
And it's not because Dick Hart's stupid. He's brilliant.

498
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:22,980
And yet he doesn't take these things doesn't seem to take X seriously or whatever it's in we do, or he takes this for granted and we certainly don't.

499
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,980
And they don't simply jump in as yeah but he's stupid and we dismiss that they're like, you know what's behind that.

500
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:36,980
Why is that and they approach their subject with a seriousness and I was really appreciated that you learn much much more about the thinker.

501
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:50,980
You learn how to think about a given philosopher in context, and it gets you out of this parochial view where, you know, I came from a small town and everybody's Christian and this is our background and everybody knows there's a God and Jesus saved us.

502
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,980
It's just like, as if you couldn't think outside that village mentally.

503
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:01,980
And I think a lot of what the good good history of philosophy is getting you outside of your mental village.

504
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,980
And there's.

505
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:21,980
Yeah, and I think that's what has really expanded and enriched I think my understanding of Spinoza of Plato of Piero of Ellis you know take the any of these figures, where you have really good professors that know the context and take their subject seriously

506
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:28,980
and learn an immense amount. I only wish that philosophers would take that attitude to Iran. I mean some do.

507
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:37,980
They're typically fans of Iran, who are wind up being the experts in her philosophy, but then if you're a fan of Iran or proponent or an advocate in some sense.

508
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:48,980
It's easy for others to dismiss all those are just the fans and then, you know, but you'd like so you take something like the companion to Iran right this is kind of an academic but where you're right here.

509
00:44:48,980 --> 00:45:01,980
It's an academic publication with a lot of serious content on Iran's a lot of scholarly work on it, and, you know, it's often ignored, sadly.

510
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,980
I wish that was more the approach.

511
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:14,980
You started reading, I think it's the, is it the last sentence of my article I think I think it is I should know.

512
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:31,980
But they're the their dismissal is unprofessional I mean, this is one of the things that's actually praiseworthy about philosophy of the last 50 or so years professional philosophy is that the history of philosophy is way better than it used to be for just the kind of reasons you're

513
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:48,980
the richer it's they're much more sensitive to the authors philosophical historical context, understanding on their, them on their own terms, and they have no patience for people who would approach those figures in a like play though in a parochial

514
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,980
matter that's why it doesn't happen because there's good

515
00:45:51,980 --> 00:46:08,980
I've heard professors like this guy doesn't know anything like that that's that there is like this is the stupidest presentation of Kant or Plato or whatever it is because like these people take their subjects seriously, and it's like you're just way off and from the

516
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:24,980
you could you could you could never do the kind of criticism that Sidney hook or Massimo Piliucci did it that I go through in the beginning of my article to a major canon figure you just be like,

517
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:42,980
this is foolish like why why is a philosophy professor writing this way. So that's why I say it's it's unprofessional of them because there are good standards in there are some good standards in professional philosophy and the kind of historical interpretive standards are

518
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:49,980
basically right on and well functioning and part of the issue is when they deal with iron Rand.

519
00:46:49,980 --> 00:47:03,980
Yeah, when they do with iron Rand, I would imagine if if if there if there are other parallel controversial figures that professional philosophers hate that we'd see something similar in the way in the way they approach them.

520
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,980
Them to.

521
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:24,980
But I mean Rand's a but ran part of the reason ran gets such strong reactions is that she's not an obscure an obscure figure that the profession kind of looks down at she's like a mainstream

522
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:40,980
person to regular to regular people she's popular she's more popular than most almost any like living philosopher today. So that's you know what another part of why she gets so much of this and other other people do not.

523
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:56,980
Yeah, that's an important point to raise is that if other canonical figures in the history of philosophy were afforded the treatment that the philosophers you mentioned talking about iron Rand.

524
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:12,980
Give iron Rand, I mean, they probably wouldn't get published they'd be sort of laughed out of the out of the journal out of the journal so to speak, because I like like in, I wrote a piece called why Massimo Piliucci gets iron ran wrong, and it had to do with.

525
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:26,980
He wrote some piece on iron Rand and our relation to aerosol. And I mean, it was largely just silly. And he took two quotes, put him into one block quote as if it's from the same thing.

526
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:38,980
Once by iron ran from one source, one's actually by Leonard Peacock from a book, and they attributes it to a wrong source by some other article that iron ran wrote that he didn't know iron ran wrote.

527
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:49,980
It was like, he said that this comes from some objectivist or something I get that objectivist is iron ran Massimo. And it's just so cavalier, which the way he treats it.

528
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:56,980
But I like the way you definitely one of the article, the people who take iron ran more seriously as well.

529
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:14,980
Yeah, so what one of the, the one of the points I make in the article is that, yeah, that you can laugh at how crude, the foolish Massimo Piliucci is, and if jibes are, but it's basically the same thing is going on in the Rachel's textbook.

530
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:40,980
It's just, you know, more, it's a more clever than, than what he does. And I don't want to put Mike humor in this, in this camp, I think in fairness to him. He actually treats her with the level of respect that professional philosophers treat each other when they're criticizing each other.

531
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:57,980
Like, it's a lot of times you get back and forth like, well, you didn't really get me right. This isn't, but it's like, no, he gives the sites paragraphs that he's getting drawing his points from and, and there it's just more like you could have a serious, I like, I think he's, you could have a serious back and forth with him.

532
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:06,980
I don't think you could with Rachel's or Piliucci or Sidney Hook or some of the others I cite.

533
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,980
So we've been talking about the critics right now of Inrand.

534
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:20,980
But my guess is there are ways in which even fans of Inrand or could be parochial in their thinking as well.

535
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:35,980
Parochial thinking isn't restricted to critics of Inrand. So it's a kind of general kind of phenomenon, a way of approaching ideas from a kind of local limited perspective where you're not fully aware that you're taking for granted a lot of things that are at issue.

536
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:44,980
And then are there ways in which you think even fans of Inrand can be parochial and ways in which, if so, we can avoid that.

537
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:54,980
Well, you mentioned the value of the history of philosophy for, for breaking out of your parochial habits. I mean, like I say in the article, this is kind of the default way.

538
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:03,980
Where, where else would you start, but with what you're already familiar with and comfortable with? Like, that's sure that there's nothing wrong with starting that way.

539
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:09,980
But then you also want to be self conscious. Like, yeah, there's a whole wider world out there that I'm not, you know, not familiar with.

540
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:26,980
There's different ways of thinking about things. And part of, especially if you're into Inrand and you're like an undergrad, one of the best things you can do is just seek out other philosophies and like think about,

541
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Okay, the Plato approaches it this way. Inrand approaches it that way. Like try to understand why there's a difference there and really think about who's right and what is Plato assuming that I'm not or that Inrand's not, what is she back and forth.

542
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,980
And you can, you know, you can do the same thing with your professors, get criticisms from them.

543
00:51:46,980 --> 00:52:00,980
And can I really answer this? And do I, do I know what's, what, where he's coming from? Is it just a, you know, is he just being more like Massimo Pealeucci, just straight up misrepresenting things?

544
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:06,980
Or is he being more thoughtful, like a more like a Nozick or a bicumor? And do I have answers to these things? And if I don't, what does that mean?

545
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:15,980
That's, that's the best thing you could do to train yourself to just question your own assumptions, question your own premises, check your own premises, is to have them challenged?

546
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,980
Yeah, I mean, a lot of times you're assuming.

547
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,980
You're assuming straight out of Inrand's attitude toward a proper methodology.

548
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:30,980
A lot of times, a lot of times you don't know you're holding something as an assumption, as a premise, until you encounter somebody who doesn't.

549
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:41,980
And then it's like, what, what, they seem stupid. And this is what I say in the, in the article about, like, the way Rand looks to some of these people who are criticizing her.

550
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:53,980
Like, she's disputing assumptions so basic that they don't, that they have that they don't even, like, bother debating about talking about, and then she doesn't share them.

551
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,980
And it's like, who is this weird person who doesn't know that everything is like math?

552
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,980
Like, who doesn't know that?

553
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,980
Like, we all know this.

554
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,980
And then what we're saying here is it goes the other way too.

555
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:16,980
Yeah, for a lot of people, including myself, reading Inrand as a young person was my introduction to philosophy.

556
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,980
I mean, I heard the word philosophy, but I hadn't studied any particular philosopher before I read the fountain head and out the shrugged and then everything.

557
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:31,980
And it was like, and of course, I ran introduced me to the subject of philosophy, in part via her own philosophy, but also her treatment of other philosophers.

558
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,980
And so that's what I sort of took for granted, sort of at the outset.

559
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,980
Now, I went on to study philosophy and take other philosophers quite seriously.

560
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,980
And I benefited enormously from that.

561
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:51,980
But there is that sense in which you get introduced, many people get introduced to philosophy and to other philosophers via Inrand's philosophy and what she thinks of those other philosophers.

562
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,980
And then they can come in and spouting off things about Kant and the never read Kant.

563
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,980
It's that kind of thing, which must be just as irritating to a Kant scholar.

564
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,980
Yeah, this is his view. And it's like, have you ever read Kant?

565
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:12,980
Well, no, but I mean, that's would be just that's the sort of analog of what's so irritating to us when people treat Inrand that way.

566
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:19,980
It goes both ways. And the solution goes both ways is applicable to both.

567
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:31,980
I mean, a good little a good little test for yourself is just if you're super into objectivism and you're an under like your young philosophy student want to make make the most out of your time in college.

568
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Just a little check for yourself is when you're making an argument or a criticism of someone.

569
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:50,980
So another figure, Kant or whoever would, if somebody wrote what I or said what I just said about Rand.

570
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:56,980
How would I take that? Like, this is a complete representation. You don't know what you've read. You haven't read anything.

571
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:00,980
Yeah, if you're going into philosophy class, you say, Oh, I know all about Hume.

572
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:06,980
I didn't read Hume. I listened to Leonard Pieckoff lecture about Hume once. Now I know all about Hume.

573
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:20,980
That's a good place to start, but you don't know all about Hume. And you don't want to do the same thing that the critics are doing. You want to aspire to a better approach.

574
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:27,980
Don't don't take objectivism as if it's self evident and unquestionable.

575
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,980
I mean, that's that's an aspect of objectivity.

576
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,980
Yeah.

577
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:40,980
Yeah, so Mike's article is called Why Can't Professional Philosophers Get Rand Right? That's the one we've been talking about today.

578
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,980
And I also want to point people toward an article I wrote called Why Massimo Piliucci Gets Rand Wrong.

579
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:51,980
He's a prominent philosopher of science and it addresses a similar issue to the one Mike is addressing.

580
00:55:52,980 --> 00:56:07,980
I also want to point people toward a companion to Ein Rand. This is the book of scholarly work on Ein Rand's thought, and particularly toward chapter one, which is by Greg Salmiere, which is available online as a free PDF.

581
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,980
So if you click the link in the show notes, you can get that.

582
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:20,980
It's particularly important reading I think in this context because it addresses Ein Rand as a philosophical outsider and how to approach her work in that vein.

583
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:32,980
So that's it for resources for today. I think so stay tuned for next week's show. And please send questions for future podcast or future Q&A episodes to experts at Ein Rand.org.
