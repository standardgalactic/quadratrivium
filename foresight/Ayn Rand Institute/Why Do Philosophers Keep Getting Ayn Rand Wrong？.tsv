0	4540	Ayn Rand is one of the most provocative voices of the 20th century.
4540	9200	Her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrug have earned her fame for their popularity
9200	12040	and notoriety for their content.
12040	16600	In her many essays, public lectures, radio and television interviews, Ayn Rand offered
16600	21360	a unique perspective on a wide range of philosophical problems.
21360	27480	Yet academic philosophers, both in her time and hours, have responded to her work largely
27480	30440	with derision and dismissal.
30440	34240	What explains this attitude by professional philosophers?
34240	37800	Why do they routinely dismiss Ayn Rand?
37800	40840	Welcome to New Ideal Live, the podcast of the Ayn Rand Institute.
40840	44480	I'm Aaron Smith, a fellow instructor at ARI.
44480	48480	Joining me today is ARI associate fellow Mike Mazum.
48480	55160	Now, Mike, in your article, Why Can't Professional Philosophers Get Ayn Rand Right?
55160	57160	You address this question.
57160	60920	And I wanted to spend some time talking with you about the article and about the case you
60920	64840	make in that article, because I think it's an important case.
64840	67800	And I want to just read a quote from that article.
67800	73960	You say, until professional philosophers engage with Rand's actual arguments, their
73960	79640	pat dismissal of her philosophy remains an unprofessional prejudice.
79640	80640	End quote.
80640	84720	For those who may not have read the article, can you give us some kind of an overview of
84760	89040	what that article is about and what you're arguing in it?
89040	91040	Yeah, thanks, Aaron.
91040	99640	So there are dozens of criticisms of Rand floating out there, dozens as probably an understatement.
99640	110320	And part of what we do at ARI and part of what I see myself as doing is advocating, expanding
110320	114800	on and teaching about Rand's philosophy.
114800	120080	So part of that means responding to criticisms.
120080	126160	And many of the criticisms that are floating out there have responses to them in the Objectivist
126160	132840	secondary literature in podcasts on websites.
132840	138880	What I wanted to do in the article was to draw attention to a thread or a through line
138960	146640	that characterizes most of these criticisms, particularly the ones that are coming from
146640	149440	professional philosophy.
149440	155720	If you have been in philosophy classes as an undergraduate and discussed I and Rand with
155720	163040	your professors, you probably get some version of she's not serious, she's not a philosopher.
163040	168720	Her arguments are lame, bad, weak.
168720	173760	And if they even concede that she has arguments at all, there's more than a few who would
173760	176040	just say she doesn't even argue for her position.
176040	181480	She takes these controversial positions, but she won't give arguments for them.
181480	186360	What she'll do is she'll write a mean character who has a view that she doesn't like and make
186360	192800	them look stupid and then the view that she does like looks heroic in another character.
192800	197800	So why do they have this attitude?
197800	205440	Why do they have this such a strong and impassioned rejection of her?
205440	211400	It's a kind of puzzle that a lot of her fans have, why am I getting this hostility from
211400	216360	my professors because I like these ideas?
216360	226360	And also why can't my professors seem to criticize the views that I think I agree with?
226360	234680	Is the accusation of straw manning Rand is a common kind of response to these criticisms?
234680	245360	So what I do in the article is go through some of the criticisms that are sort of viral
245360	252380	in the Rand fan world, that's the Mike Cumers criticisms that I discuss have been floating
252380	254300	around the internet for decades.
254300	260100	And also criticisms from people in philosophy who are prominent, even if I don't think they're
260100	268780	good criticisms or even criticisms that have a lot of viewership, they're still notable
268780	273100	because of the stature of the people in the profession.
273100	281800	So what I did in the article is made the case that there's a feature that all of these arguments,
281800	288080	all of these criticisms have in common that fans of Rand and people who maybe aren't Rand
288080	295300	fans but are just kind of interested in objectivism as a cultural phenomenon haven't noticed
295300	296600	or aren't aware of.
296600	301340	So a lot of the responses to the criticisms that I discuss, for example, the responses
301340	308880	to Mike Humer or the responses to Robert Nozick, take the criticisms as given and just you've
308880	313780	got in respond by saying, well, you haven't correctly characterized her in this way or
313780	314780	that way.
314780	319880	What I'm trying to do is not reply directly to these criticisms but show that these criticisms
319880	329920	stem from some a wrong approach to the project of understanding and criticizing Rand and
329920	334020	that's the what I call philosophical procalism.
334020	339760	One of the things that I noticed from your article is that you don't take the tack that
339760	344640	I think a lot of people take is they look at this some sort of mis-presentation of one
344640	349280	of Iron Man's arguments and they say, well, this is dishonest, this is obviously dishonest.
349280	355120	And even if there is an element of dishonesty there sometimes, it's I think that's not the
355120	357400	tack you take in this article.
357400	363320	And so we're going to look at the issue of what you call philosophical parochialism and
363320	364900	sort of unpack that.
364900	370980	But just I don't know for motivations point like what who cares what these academics think?
370980	375140	I mean, you mentioned people like Brian Leiter and now many people in the audience might
375140	379980	not know who these people are, but these are all academic philosophers of mixed prominence.
379980	385260	Some are quite prominent, some are less like maybe semi prominent, but Brian Leiter, Masimo
385260	390700	Piliucci, I've written about him before, James Rachel's, Robert Nozick and you mentioned
390700	392460	Michael Humer.
392460	395440	Why do you think it's important to respond to these critics?
395440	398440	And I think in particularly the way you do.
398440	405360	So one thing to say is that part of advocating a radical philosophy is you look at the criticisms,
405360	407520	you think them through, respond to them.
407520	415960	That's part of your job as an advocate of controversial ideas.
415960	421800	So it just so happens that as bad as I think some of these criticisms are, they're not
421800	430380	all terrible, but as bad as some of them are, they're about as good as you'll find anywhere.
430380	436260	So if you look at the kind of criticisms you see in more popular presentations, popular
436260	445180	books, not academics, but public intellectuals who aren't academics, you get the much more
445180	447120	cruder.
447120	452160	She thinks Rand hates the poor.
452160	456280	She wants to industrialize a moral hero.
456280	457280	Yeah.
457280	460760	So if you're rich, that means you're great, like that kind of that level.
460760	466840	And what the even the bad article or bad arguments from the professional philosophers do is try
466840	470440	to, you know, how is Rand reasoning about this and where is it wrong?
470440	473160	That's what they're at least attempting to do or claiming to do.
473900	477340	They happen to be the best you find out there.
477340	488980	Now the other reason to do that is most people who have an impact on the culture at large
488980	497380	go to college and some, you know, most people take some sort of philosophy class, whether
497380	503560	it's a introduction to philosophy or whether it's just like an ethics business ethics.
503560	508080	And that's where you're introduced to different ways of thinking about philosophical issues
508080	511640	if you, if you don't learn about them on your own.
511640	517200	And in those textbooks and in those classrooms, it's the professionals who get discussed.
517200	520960	And when Rand comes up and I go through in the article, some textbook presentations of
520960	531420	Rand, it's always or almost always a hatchet job, a misrepresentation, or just, just, you
531420	535700	know, that's a attributing some motives to the people doing this.
535700	537420	It's just incompetence.
537420	540060	They just can't accurately portray her.
540060	541060	They won't quote her.
541060	544940	They'll say Rand says this, they won't give a quote, they won't give a citation.
544940	549900	Or they'll say, go read James Rachel's on Iron Rand, you know, you don't have to read
550840	551840	her.
551840	554360	So let me just interject for a second, for the sake of the audience.
554360	559280	So you mentioned James Rachel's and they might not know who that is, but he wrote a book
559280	565240	called The Elements of Moral Philosophy and it's one of the most popular and widely used
565240	570320	introductions to ethics, at least in the US, I don't know how broadly that's said, but
570320	575540	at least in the US, it's very slender, brief presentations, concise presentations of different
575540	577960	major ethical positions, and it's just used all over the place.
577980	581660	So it's, you know, when you address James Rachel's, it's like, you might not know who
581660	586820	that is, but it's, it's the author of a widely used textbook that's just all over the place
586820	588180	in philosophy departments.
588180	594940	And so if you get a treatment that mangles Iron Rand in such a popular and widely used
594940	597660	textbook, I mean, a lot of eyes are on that piece.
597660	604140	So yeah, it's also, so it's one, it's one of the most popular textbook.
604140	608520	But I think it's in its 14th edition, something like that.
608520	616560	It's been around for quite some time and it's, even when it's not assigned, the other textbooks
616560	624600	that cite Rand are clearly taking their view of what Rand is saying from James Rachel's
624600	626720	presentation of her.
626720	633600	So it's, it's not, yeah, and I think also that, I mean, one of the major things is that
633780	640940	these mangled arguments, these mis-presentations of Rand's arguments that you get, lead people
640940	643940	to dismiss Iron Rand as a serious thinker.
644860	650060	And I think the more that happens, the more this matters, I think, to us who think that
650060	655820	her philosophic thought is new, original, really important, and to the extent to which
656180	660340	they go to professional philosophers, they read treatments by these people who are experts
660340	661960	in the field.
661960	668560	And their assessment, judging by their presentation, is, yeah, this is a pretty bad argument.
668560	673560	So she can't think straight and, you know, nothing to see here, kids.
673560	676160	And that, I think, is the overall impact of this.
676160	685320	Half the country goes to college, you think half of them take an ethics class, maybe three
685320	689160	quarters of them encounter Rand in their ethics textbooks.
689160	693500	She's discussed, to some degree, in a lot of the ethics textbooks.
693500	696940	And they think, this is it, like, they come in with no opinion.
696940	700220	I've heard of her, she's, you know, whatever.
700220	703460	And this is it, this is all there is to it, this is nothing.
703460	707700	And then, you know, you don't have infinite time in your life to go explore everything.
707700	711420	So you just dismiss her and then look back, yeah.
711420	719140	So it's important to address these, these kind of criticisms.
719140	726160	Even though it's easy to dismiss academics as off in the ivory tower, I mean, they have
726160	733560	an impact on each subsequent generation just through the fact that everyone goes to college.
733560	734560	Yeah.
734560	735560	Okay.
735560	736560	So fair enough.
736560	739040	So let's, let's get into the parochialism here.
739040	744160	So this is your main sort of claim in the article that one of the reasons why, a major
744180	749980	reason why academic philosophers don't get her arguments right is because there's something
749980	752020	like a certain kind of parochialism going on.
752020	755500	Can you say what parochialism is and how it's, how do you think it's operating?
755500	759260	I mean, for the full treatment, you can read the article, but just what, what do you want
759260	760260	to bring out here?
760260	761260	Right.
761260	769620	So you're being parochial if you're assuming your own and projecting onto someone else
769620	776280	your own sort of views on the subject, assuming they agree with you on, on, on what you're
776280	778920	discussing and in philosophy.
778920	788440	So if you're discussing a philosophical theory, it's assuming concepts, definitions, views
788440	793880	of what philosophy is and how it argues when you're approaching a figure who's disputing
793880	795120	that.
795120	802260	So if you're reading Ayn Rand or if you're reading Heidegger from the German tradition
802260	807940	and you're an American 20th, 21st century mainstream academic and you read them and
807940	813420	you're just assuming that they must be interested in the same problems, 20th century American
813420	817380	academics are interested in, that they share the same definitions, that they, they share
817380	821180	the same methods and standards, that's a parochial approach to them.
821180	828440	You have to understand that people in different philosophical or historical contexts just
828440	835000	have different, different interests, different definitions, different standards of, for what
835000	836240	they're doing.
836240	843000	And part of interpreting them objectively is not imposing on them your own parochial
843000	845320	assumptions.
845320	850000	And my, my basic argument is that this is how Rand is being approached.
850000	857740	And I give an example in the article of a philosopher, Massimo Piliucci, who's criticizing
857740	861700	Rand on, on, on her metaphysics.
861700	867420	And he's, she, she defines a metaphysical concept axiom one way, and he just says, no,
867420	872500	that's not how we define it, and my response is, yeah, that's not how you define it.
872500	877380	Yeah, we, who's we, yeah, who's we, that's how you define it in the philosophy you're
877380	878720	familiar with.
878720	884640	But philosophical terms and definitions are, I mean, there are things people argue over.
884640	886940	What's the right way to define justice?
886940	889000	What's the right way to define freedom?
889000	892560	What's the right way to define axiom is the concept in question.
892560	896680	And to just assume, well, this is the way my people define, yeah, that's what's in dispute.
896680	897680	We're disputing.
897680	899440	There's a, there's a different way to think about it.
899440	903200	And Rand's saying hers is superior or correct.
903220	909180	And you're not going to, you're not going to decide who's right by just asserting your,
909180	910180	your side.
910180	911540	So that's a pretty crude version of it.
911540	916540	That's why I start with it just to familiarize the reader with what it looks like.
916540	922620	But there's more, as the article goes on, we go into more complex versions of this, assuming
922620	928020	that Rand must be arguing a certain way because, well, how else would you argue?
928020	932360	That's how we argue in 20th century academic philosophy.
932360	935580	Not being sensitive to act that she argues a different way.
935580	936580	Yeah.
936580	942420	So I want to ask you about the sort of form of argument that they think is, I don't know,
942420	947260	the gold standard, like how you're supposed to properly argue as a philosopher.
947260	952140	But just to come back to Massimo Piliucci, I mean, just to read that, there's a real
952140	957940	unseriousness on his part toward Rand, a real contempt for his subject.
957940	962340	So it's, you know, he quotes, like, as you say in the article, he quotes, he quotes
962680	968840	some statement by Ein Rand, which says something about an axiom, but it's not a definition
968840	969840	of the axiom.
969840	974760	So he leaves out the definition of an axiom, leaves in the quote, whereas he just characterizes
974760	979520	some aspect of it and says, this is what she, how she defines an axiom, wrong.
979520	986400	He says, oh, you know, without even like doing a little mini minor due diligence and just
986400	988240	kind of like, so where does she write about this?
988240	989240	How does she define this?
989240	990240	What?
990240	991240	It's just, there's none of that.
991420	992540	This is obviously wrong.
992540	993540	This is obviously silly.
993540	995260	And it just, that's not what it is.
995260	1000180	An axiom is what, what do you say, a premise where you start a discussion or something
1000180	1002300	like that, and it's like something you take for granted in a discussion.
1002300	1010380	And like, there's no investigation, no thought as she have a different conception of what
1010380	1011580	an axiom and what is that?
1011660	1012740	And what do I think of it?
1012740	1013500	And there's just none of it.
1014460	1017300	Well, we'll come, we'll come back to this, I'm sure.
1017360	1023920	But one of the things that's so frustrating about this is that, I mean, I put in the article
1023920	1027800	and you just said, these, a lot of these people writing about Rand obviously have contempt
1027800	1033720	for her. And it's actually possible to have contempt for a figure you're discussing and
1033720	1034920	not misrepresent them.
1035280	1040160	This happens all the time in good philosophical, historical scholarship.
1040440	1044840	You're discussing a figure, you think, yeah, their views are really wrong and really bad,
1044860	1045660	really evil.
1045660	1050700	And I can write a paper about it and not caricature them or misrepresent them.
1051020	1053260	So there's, there's a lot of things going on.
1054580	1059180	And that, that case is especially, a lot of things, a lot of the things that are going
1059180	1061100	on are especially obvious in that case.
1062020	1062300	Yeah.
1062580	1066260	And so part of it, I think is stemming from this, just there's a contempt for the subject,
1066740	1073100	which leads to a cavalier, unserious treatment of the subject, which then leads to
1073120	1078720	wide, just common errors, gross misrepresentations, things like, it's hard to take
1078720	1084320	seriously. And I mean, speaking for myself, like, I want to respond to these things.
1084320	1088680	And at some point it feels like, like you're flooding, swatting a fly, so to speak,
1088680	1090960	it's just sort of like, it's not worth the effort.
1091560	1092960	And yet you want to respond.
1093000	1097000	And yet the criticism is so poor that it's, it's, it's kind of embarrassing to respond.
1097920	1103000	But not all these criticisms that you mentioned for sure in your article are of
1103020	1106740	that caliber where it's just so silly, like it's, it's going to be a bit embarrassing
1106740	1107980	to respond to it.
1108940	1113500	And you make the case that they're looking for a certain kind of argument.
1114100	1121420	They don't see it in Rand and they try to reconstruct it according to what they
1121420	1122780	think an argument should look like.
1122780	1124860	And then something goes awry there.
1124860	1127140	So maybe you can tell, tell us a bit about that.
1127380	1128860	Maybe I hope I'm not mischaracterizing that.
1129660	1131260	No, that's, that's, that's fair.
1131260	1143440	So there's a standard that philosophy, or I should say, philosophers in the kind of
1143480	1149800	Anglo-American, what's sometimes called analytic tradition, that they, they want
1149840	1151960	their craft to aspire to.
1152240	1156640	And it's sort of like the standards of rigor in mathematics, where you can put
1156640	1165140	down certain propositions and then prove as a matter of formal deductive necessity
1165940	1170260	that some controversial conclusion follows from them or some, some important
1170260	1171980	conclusion follows from them.
1172820	1179660	And that's now people in that tradition are aware that that's really hard to do to, to
1179660	1184780	find it, knock down argument that just follows as a matter of pure formalism.
1184800	1188400	Like you think of, if you've taken a logic class and you write down like symbols, you
1188400	1191280	turn an English sentence into a string of symbols and prove something about it.
1191960	1193080	That's really hard to do.
1193080	1197240	It almost never happens, but that's a kind of standard we can try to approximate that.
1199360	1204960	And if you have that view as a kind of, well, this is what a good philosophical
1204960	1206000	argument looks like.
1206000	1213040	And it's not as bad as it used to be, but there was a period of time where, you know,
1213040	1219420	if you looked in a philosophy journal, this is 60s, 70s, 80s kind of, you'd see a lot
1219420	1225940	of articles, yeah, when Einren was writing, you'd see articles on, you think it's an
1225940	1231180	ethics article, oh, okay, this is going to be very, you know, how to live your life,
1231180	1236820	what's a virtue, what's a vice, what's a good, and you instead, you get analyses of
1236820	1240820	the logical structure of sentences that has the, have the word ought in it.
1241080	1245480	And there's a whole bunch of symbolic logic, is that what does this have to do with, that's
1245480	1248240	the way people were thinking and writing at the time.
1248840	1251720	And that still goes on to a lesser degree today.
1252040	1256640	A lot of the criticisms that I'm responding to originated in this time period and kind
1256640	1260800	of just have been repeated without any reflection since then.
1261280	1268440	And if that's your view of what good philosophy looks like, and that's your view of not just,
1268460	1271620	that's what good philosophy looks like, but that's just what philosophy looks like.
1272700	1278220	And then you approach Rand, you read one of her articles, and she's not arguing that way
1278300	1282740	at all, like she rejects arguing that way, she thinks that's a bad way to argue,
1282980	1285540	it's never going to get you anywhere, it's not going to get you to the truth.
1287780	1289460	There's a question of what do I make of this?
1290420	1295500	And if you went to graduate school during that period of time, you might not even know
1295520	1301600	that there are other ways people reason and argue, you might not have learned that.
1302240	1307720	And you might not see that major figures in the history of philosophy are arguing that way
1307720	1314000	because it's hard to parse an interesting philosophical argument and see what its parts are.
1314500	1327140	So my conclusion is that a lot of the more sophisticated criticisms are trying
1327140	1333500	to take something resembling what Rand says in her published essays and like shoehorn them
1333500	1342580	into this premise, premise, conclusion structure of reasoning that the profession values.
1342640	1344760	And that's just not how she's arguing.
1346460	1352480	And you make a case in the, I mean, I'm not, I take it you don't have any problem
1352480	1355720	with putting together premises and conclusions.
1355720	1359480	I mean, one of the things that you do when you look in an article is what are the points
1359480	1365120	that are adduced that are intended by the author to support or give evidence for
1365680	1368480	or plausibility for a conclusion?
1368480	1373660	I think obviously we're not saying anything negative against that, but there's a particular kind
1373660	1378400	of deductive structure that they're trying to, they don't find in Ayn Rand.
1379360	1383720	So part of it is they think, well, she doesn't really have arguments because they don't find that.
1384200	1387740	And then part of it is, well, she doesn't really have arguments, but let's see if we can put it
1388700	1394980	in a deductive form so where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.
1395640	1400400	And then you're saying that's often not what you find in Rand's work.
1400400	1403120	And you give an argument in the piece.
1403120	1405720	I don't know how much you want to talk about this, but her argument.
1405720	1412720	No, just as a point of evidence in favor of this as an interpretation of what they're doing.
1412920	1416080	This is what Robert Nozick says he's doing, like explicitly.
1416080	1421640	He starts his article saying, yeah, he starts his article saying, I'd like to reconstruct Rand's
1421660	1426020	argument as a deductive argument with premises and et cetera.
1426300	1429060	And then he says, I don't know what that is.
1429220	1431060	So I'm going to fill in the blanks for her.
1431940	1433940	Yeah. And that was on the Randian argument.
1434660	1439300	That's on the Randian argument in 1971, or maybe 73.
1439300	1441780	Yeah. And that gets referred to a lot.
1441940	1444940	Yeah. Just look at Nozick's takedown and on the Randian argument.
1444940	1447020	Again, that's the way these things function.
1447360	1454880	So it's not like those arguments have been given, in this case, there were responses,
1454880	1460440	contemporaneous responses to Nozick's on the Randian argument article.
1461880	1467240	And maybe you can mention some of those, but often it's just they stand as, yeah, just see,
1467240	1471960	just see Nozick or just see James Rachel's and that's already been taken care of.
1472440	1473880	And then that's part of the way.
1474740	1482180	There's an amusing exchange on one of the major professional philosophy blogs.
1482540	1487460	Somebody writes in and asks, what are the best academic criticisms of
1487460	1490540	Ayn Rand looking for like ammunition?
1491460	1497100	And there's a whole bunch of threads or a whole bunch of replies with, you know,
1497100	1498820	recognizable names replying.
1499180	1502860	And they come up with a whole lot of nothing except Robert Nozick's article.
1503280	1508320	And he starts the article saying, I don't really know how to accurately represent Rand's argument.
1508320	1509880	I'm going to give my own version of it.
1510360	1513960	So that's like the best they can do when they're when they're asked.
1514200	1516840	So that's, I mean, you asked earlier, why is this worth responding to?
1516840	1518360	Yeah, that's another reason worth responding to.
1518360	1522360	It's like, you'll go to your professors and ask them, what do you think about Ayn Rand?
1522360	1523440	And you'll get hostility.
1523440	1527680	And then like really ask them, like, what's a good response?
1527680	1528640	And if that's, yeah.
1529340	1536180	I think one of the really valuable things, I mean, about your article is that you take
1536180	1541060	the time to show what's how these arguments go wrong.
1541260	1543900	So it's Sidney Hook's famous criticism.
1544820	1548260	Robert Nozick's now famous article on the Randian argument.
1548580	1555980	James Rachel's widely popular treatment of Ayn Rand's egoism in his moral
1555980	1563480	philosophy textbook and to show that they go wrong, that they don't match Rand's
1563480	1573440	argument and then go on to say underlying why they, what's generating this, what's
1573440	1576760	the mistreatment of the mishandling of the argument, the mispresentation of the
1576760	1580960	argument is they have a kind of parochial view about what an argument looks like,
1580960	1585040	what philosophy, what it means to practice philosophy and they, as a result, they
1585060	1587180	don't find these kinds of arguments in her.
1587580	1591740	What kind of arguments do you find if you're not finding deductive arguments?
1591740	1594780	I mean, she obviously, well, you have people that say she makes no arguments.
1596660	1601500	Again, for someone who reads that and thinks, like, what are you talking about?
1601780	1605300	I think this also helps to see like they're looking for a specific kind of
1605300	1607020	thing when they're looking for an argument, they don't find it.
1607700	1609540	But does she make arguments, Mike?
1609960	1615040	Yeah, so read the article for the details, but in short summary, she does make
1615040	1618840	arguments, they're not the kind of arguments you find in math, they're more
1618840	1623680	like the kind of arguments you find in the sciences, they're explanatory arguments.
1623680	1631040	She's looking at some phenomenon about, so the example I give in the article is
1631040	1637040	her argument for egoism, she's looking to explain why we pursue values to begin with.
1638040	1641540	And then she's using that explanation to go on and give a further explanation.
1641540	1645940	So if this is why we pursue values to begin with, why do we need to pursue
1645940	1649540	values under the guidance of a systematic code?
1649540	1652540	So she gives a series of explanatory arguments.
1652540	1658540	It's more help, if you want to understand the form of the argument, like how she argues,
1658540	1665980	it would be more helpful to learn about explanation in the history of the
1666480	1671480	biology or something, than it would be to look at how math structures its arguments.
1671480	1678480	But the pattern in philosophy has been to look to math, not to the inductive sciences.
1680480	1684480	So yeah, for the details, you have to look at the article.
1685480	1690480	Okay, so I think one of the values of the article, for people who are interested
1690480	1695480	in objectivism and frustrated by these kind of presentations of Rand's work,
1695980	1701980	I think this helps it go some distance in explaining what's behind it,
1701980	1709980	beyond other than or in addition to some kind of dishonesty or hostility toward Rand.
1709980	1715980	Because the hostility is real, whether or not that factors in the presentation of Rand or not.
1715980	1717980	I think sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.
1717980	1722980	Like you mentioned, Nozick wasn't hostile to Rand and he was more sympathetic to her.
1723480	1728480	As far as you can tell, trying to present, to fairly present her case.
1728480	1733480	Whereas other things are just kind of smears and it's not always like that, though it often is.
1733480	1736980	Yeah, I mean, I don't think Nozick is hostile.
1736980	1739480	I don't consider Mike Humor hostile.
1739480	1746480	So if we're thinking about, my question is why do professional philosophers,
1747480	1749480	why can't they get Rand right?
1749980	1756980	What I'm trying to do is give a major factor that people aren't aware of.
1756980	1762980	So if you really want the full answer to the question, it's like a multi-factor explanation.
1762980	1768980	So as we pointed out with Massimo Piliucci's criticism,
1768980	1770980	yeah, there's just some intellectual dishonesty here.
1770980	1773980	He's quoting her out of context.
1774480	1780480	He's kind of just crudely asserting his own view as if that in and of itself is a response to anything.
1780480	1784480	And the guy has three PhDs, like he knows what's wrong with that.
1784480	1792480	So that's certainly, you can't have a full understanding of why some academics reject her so strongly.
1792480	1795480	Part of it is there's just some dishonesty.
1795480	1798480	But I mean, dishonesty doesn't exist in a vacuum.
1798980	1802980	So other relevant factors are there's hostility to her.
1802980	1807980	Moral and political views are that's certainly relevant to understanding why she's rejected.
1807980	1812980	Most philosophers are very left-wing.
1812980	1815980	That's certainly relevant.
1815980	1825980	They're all bought into altruism or just computer subjectivism as a moral framework.
1826480	1832480	So they're hostile to the egoism just as in so far as the content is concerned.
1832480	1838480	And then you have to see all of those things interacting with the prokulism.
1838480	1842480	So there couldn't possibly be a better argument for a good argument for capitalism.
1842480	1847480	I mean, I've read Nozick, I've read Milton Friedman.
1847480	1849480	She just has to be saying some other version of that.
1849480	1854480	And those arguments are dumb, so I don't need to bother taking her too seriously.
1854980	1857980	That's a kind of prokulism in and of itself.
1857980	1868980	And then if you are deep into Rand's philosophy, you'll be familiar with her claims.
1868980	1877980	You can't defend capitalism without a radical revision of your moral and epistemological views.
1877980	1887980	So that kind of factor interacts with the professor's rejection of the political views.
1887980	1889980	So these are all relevant factors.
1889980	1897980	And what I want to draw people's attention to is just this additional one that you might not have noticed.
1897980	1902980	Yeah, because I think it's really non-obvious, particular to people who aren't in the field.
1902980	1907980	And there is a sense in which, so in graduate school often we're taught to...
1907980	1915980	So we both have PhDs in philosophy, so we spent time in academia and learning about what philosophic arguments are supposed to look like,
1915980	1919980	at least as we're taught, and you're often taught to sort of put things in standard form.
1919980	1921980	You put it in terms of premises in conclusion.
1921980	1925980	And often you'll read a piece that it's hard to do that with.
1925980	1927980	And it's not just on Rand.
1927980	1935980	So one of the most widely assigned pieces of reading in introductory philosophy courses,
1935980	1941980	or introductory ethics courses, is Plato's dialogue, Euthyphro,
1941980	1948980	where Socrates is talking to this guy named Euthyphro and part of what happens in the dialogue is that
1948980	1954980	he's questioning Euthyphro about his use of a particular concept and his understanding of it.
1954980	1961980	Because his grasp of that concept is going to have an impact on how he functions in his life and on some important issue.
1961980	1968980	And as they sort of go around and through the discussion, it turns out, he doesn't really know what he's talking about.
1968980	1972980	He doesn't have a clear-headed notion of what kind of concept.
1972980	1977980	It's in this case, it's piety, but you could substitute it, like in many of his other dialogues,
1977980	1981980	it's justice, it's knowledge, and so on, courage.
1981980	1989980	And what he's pointing out is you don't have a clear view of what you mean by this concept, and yet you're functioning with it.
1989980	1997980	And it's part of your operating system, and yet it's clearly unsatisfactory, like in a significant way.
1997980	2000980	And you need to pay more attention to that.
2000980	2008980	Now, it's very hard to put that in some sort of standard form, and I've seen professors try to do it, like as a TA in, of course, in ethics,
2008980	2015980	I saw professors do that, and it was, it misses most of what the dialogue is about.
2015980	2020980	It's like, yeah, Socrates is making this argument, and if you put it in this form, clearly the conclusion doesn't follow,
2020980	2024980	and so because there's all sorts of counter-examples, and this is silly, and what a dumb argument,
2024980	2031980	and it's like you miss the force of a really important philosophical dialogue that has resonance today.
2031980	2040980	Like, I mean, I assigned, I teach Objectivism, I assigned the youth of Rome for its power and its impact and the point it makes,
2040980	2046980	and it's kind of, Rand is making something of a similar point in philosophy who needs it, and yet you miss it completely.
2046980	2050980	And that's just another example of this. This is how you're supposed to think about an argument.
2050980	2054980	You don't find it in there, let's shoehorn it into some kind of argument.
2054980	2060980	The argument doesn't really work very well. It doesn't really represent what's going on in that philosophical work.
2060980	2065980	And then you say, and then the students are going, yeah, well, Socrates is not much of a thinker.
2065980	2080980	Well, I allude to this a little bit in the article where I make the point that the way Rand's arguing shouldn't be,
2080980	2087980	it's not as if she's got a completely out of left field new way to give a philosophical argument.
2087980	2093980	Now, she's much better at it than the philosophers in the historical canon.
2093980	2098980	But other philosophers give explanatory arguments, including Plato.
2098980	2102980	I don't think they're good explanations, but that's how they're reasoning.
2102980	2116980	And one of the pieces of evidence to think that there's something unjust and dishonest about how Rand is discussed by academic philosophers
2117980	2129980	is if you really took the standards they're trying to apply to her and apply them to somebody like Descartes or Plato,
2129980	2133980	you'd have to say they're not good philosophers either.
2133980	2141980	They don't make the kind of rigorous deductive arguments that you look that the 20th century figures are looking for.
2141980	2148980	At least they don't always. The theories they're most well remembered for are not argued for in that way.
2148980	2155980	They're more argued for. The forums best explain certain things, like I cite the Fido in my article.
2155980	2169980	And if you really held yourself to that standard they're trying to impose on Rand, then none of these people are serious thinkers either.
2169980	2172980	And now they don't do that. So why not?
2172980	2175980	And that's where you have to factor in it.
2175980	2183980	One is just, well, we're supposed to think Plato is a good philosopher, so we don't raise these objections to him.
2183980	2187980	But also Rand's a right winger and we hate her for that.
2187980	2192980	And she's a capitalist and she says it's good to be selfish, so we hate her views too.
2192980	2196980	And again, all these factors interact.
2196980	2204980	But I mean, any time you see a kind of inconsistent application of a standard, and it's really strong evidence.
2204980	2206980	At least raises a flag.
2206980	2212980	Yeah, at least raises a flag. Yeah, there's several things going on here.
2212980	2225980	One of which is just there's an injustice and the other of which is, you know, you have to dig into understanding that and that's part of what bringing out the prokulism of the approach does.
2226980	2228980	Okay.
2228980	2241980	So your article focuses mainly on the prokulism. And I think it's good that we did mention, you know, there are other factors going on, it's not just this but one thing is just like this is one factor that's not often seen or noticed.
2241980	2245980	And I think it's like,
2245980	2254980	maybe this is a bit of a side point, but can you say why you think it's important to flag that the issue of prokulism because I think about graduate students.
2254980	2256980	I think it's important now.
2256980	2271980	So, you take a standard sort of fan of I ran they read out the shrug they read the fountain head. They get inspired by the novels. In some cases it feels right quite liberating it's the, it gives them a framework that is empowering and so on.
2271980	2276980	And they read something like I ran is not really a philosopher arguments are all bad. And it doesn't.
2277980	2287980	But if you're actually studying philosophy or intellectual fields, and you come across these things, I think it's useful to note.
2287980	2300980	I think your articles worth reading, I think in part that I was just talking to somebody who was in political science. And she was saying, I, you know, I want to I want to see Rand's argument in deductive form and she wasn't critical.
2300980	2312980	She wasn't, she wasn't a criticism of critical mind renders just sort of like, that's what I'm looking for. And it's like that's what we're seeing effect taught to look for. And then if you don't see those you don't find those you start to think well maybe there's something to that criticism
2312980	2319980	maybe she just doesn't really make arguments or her arguments are bad. If you try to put them in deductive form and then it sort of mangles the argument.
2319980	2325980	Yeah, I mean, Rand is saying philosophies not like that.
2325980	2336980	Yeah, say more about that because that's important because she rejects that method of argumentation, not just that she doesn't do things like professionals today do it.
2336980	2345980	And so there's some confusion, and she's saying, you guys don't know how to argue in philosophy. And I mean she thinks the field has collapsed.
2346980	2356980	The whole field of philosophy in fact, has collapsed in a in a fundamental way they're not, they're not forming systems anymore, predominantly.
2356980	2362980	And yeah, she thinks that there's a kind of dereliction of the field.
2363980	2384980	So to just to just indicate that that there's more going on here like you wouldn't say that about the origin of the species, or like Galileo's arguments for the for the for the sun being the center of the solar system.
2385980	2390980	You wouldn't say I can't put it in a deductive form.
2390980	2397980	So that means there's no arguments easy. Yeah, that's just not the sciences just aren't like that.
2397980	2412980	And Rand's saying something similar about philosophy is not like that it's not like math where maybe in math you can do that sort of thing saying no it's more like the sciences and is she right about that I mean that is a philosophical question.
2412980	2419980	What methods should philosophy use. What kind of subject is it.
2419980	2426980	And she's calling that into question and she's, she has her own way of thinking about it. And I mean even it.
2426980	2436980	She indicates that she's doing that in most of the major texts when she argues for egoism in the objectives ethics.
2436980	2445980	She starts the essay by talking about how the science of ethics should look how it should proceed what its questions are.
2445980	2457980	And why people have not like been able to see that she gives a whole argument that the first question of ethics is does man, what are values and does man need them.
2457980	2462980	That's not usually how you start ethics when you take intro to ethics that's not how it begins.
2462980	2479980	But she's got a different view and she's telling you she has a different view. And that's one of the, you know, one of the just indications that these critics commentators are approaching their, their subject with this populism is that she's
2479980	2489980	literally telling you that she's doing something different. And they just doesn't register they don't even acknowledge that she say they don't say, well she says she's doing something different which is really not.
2489980	2493980	It just goes in one ear at the other like it's not even there.
2493980	2501980	Yeah, and I think so one of the things I appreciated the most in my own graduate school and philosophy.
2501980	2511980	And I tried to emulate because I thought like this is the right way to approach a particular philosopher.
2511980	2530980	Particularly when you disagree with them or don't understand him but it was usually him is to understand the philosopher in his own terms or on his own terms in the context of his times addressing the kinds of issues that person does so one of
2530980	2540980	things that's standard. And I think it's interesting that the philosophers that you mentioned in the article, predominantly are not historians of philosophy.
2540980	2553980	So I studied in departments where they had people and I tended to gravitate toward these people that are historians in philosophy, whether in ancient Greek philosophy or typically early modern where
2553980	2559980	it's like if you take Dick Hart says this and this and you put some premises and that's stupid. It's like none of them approach it like that.
2559980	2567980	They look at this and say what Dick Hart is doing is he's trying and they try to put it in a context. What are his own aims.
2567980	2576980	How does he think philosophy should properly function how do you think you should argue why does he take these premises which seems strange to us for granted.
2576980	2588980	Why doesn't he question these other things which we think are obviously questionable. And it's taking the philosopher seriously like yeah no there's a reason why he doesn't question these things.
2588980	2593980	And it's not because Dick Hart's stupid. He's brilliant.
2593980	2602980	And yet he doesn't take these things doesn't seem to take X seriously or whatever it's in we do, or he takes this for granted and we certainly don't.
2602980	2608980	And they don't simply jump in as yeah but he's stupid and we dismiss that they're like, you know what's behind that.
2608980	2616980	Why is that and they approach their subject with a seriousness and I was really appreciated that you learn much much more about the thinker.
2616980	2630980	You learn how to think about a given philosopher in context, and it gets you out of this parochial view where, you know, I came from a small town and everybody's Christian and this is our background and everybody knows there's a God and Jesus saved us.
2630980	2635980	It's just like, as if you couldn't think outside that village mentally.
2635980	2641980	And I think a lot of what the good good history of philosophy is getting you outside of your mental village.
2641980	2644980	And there's.
2644980	2661980	Yeah, and I think that's what has really expanded and enriched I think my understanding of Spinoza of Plato of Piero of Ellis you know take the any of these figures, where you have really good professors that know the context and take their subject seriously
2661980	2668980	and learn an immense amount. I only wish that philosophers would take that attitude to Iran. I mean some do.
2668980	2677980	They're typically fans of Iran, who are wind up being the experts in her philosophy, but then if you're a fan of Iran or proponent or an advocate in some sense.
2677980	2688980	It's easy for others to dismiss all those are just the fans and then, you know, but you'd like so you take something like the companion to Iran right this is kind of an academic but where you're right here.
2688980	2701980	It's an academic publication with a lot of serious content on Iran's a lot of scholarly work on it, and, you know, it's often ignored, sadly.
2701980	2705980	I wish that was more the approach.
2705980	2714980	You started reading, I think it's the, is it the last sentence of my article I think I think it is I should know.
2714980	2731980	But they're the their dismissal is unprofessional I mean, this is one of the things that's actually praiseworthy about philosophy of the last 50 or so years professional philosophy is that the history of philosophy is way better than it used to be for just the kind of reasons you're
2731980	2748980	the richer it's they're much more sensitive to the authors philosophical historical context, understanding on their, them on their own terms, and they have no patience for people who would approach those figures in a like play though in a parochial
2748980	2750980	matter that's why it doesn't happen because there's good
2751980	2768980	I've heard professors like this guy doesn't know anything like that that's that there is like this is the stupidest presentation of Kant or Plato or whatever it is because like these people take their subjects seriously, and it's like you're just way off and from the
2769980	2784980	you could you could you could never do the kind of criticism that Sidney hook or Massimo Piliucci did it that I go through in the beginning of my article to a major canon figure you just be like,
2785980	2802980	this is foolish like why why is a philosophy professor writing this way. So that's why I say it's it's unprofessional of them because there are good standards in there are some good standards in professional philosophy and the kind of historical interpretive standards are
2802980	2809980	basically right on and well functioning and part of the issue is when they deal with iron Rand.
2809980	2823980	Yeah, when they do with iron Rand, I would imagine if if if there if there are other parallel controversial figures that professional philosophers hate that we'd see something similar in the way in the way they approach them.
2823980	2828980	Them to.
2828980	2844980	But I mean Rand's a but ran part of the reason ran gets such strong reactions is that she's not an obscure an obscure figure that the profession kind of looks down at she's like a mainstream
2844980	2860980	person to regular to regular people she's popular she's more popular than most almost any like living philosopher today. So that's you know what another part of why she gets so much of this and other other people do not.
2860980	2876980	Yeah, that's an important point to raise is that if other canonical figures in the history of philosophy were afforded the treatment that the philosophers you mentioned talking about iron Rand.
2877980	2892980	Give iron Rand, I mean, they probably wouldn't get published they'd be sort of laughed out of the out of the journal out of the journal so to speak, because I like like in, I wrote a piece called why Massimo Piliucci gets iron ran wrong, and it had to do with.
2892980	2906980	He wrote some piece on iron Rand and our relation to aerosol. And I mean, it was largely just silly. And he took two quotes, put him into one block quote as if it's from the same thing.
2906980	2918980	Once by iron ran from one source, one's actually by Leonard Peacock from a book, and they attributes it to a wrong source by some other article that iron ran wrote that he didn't know iron ran wrote.
2918980	2929980	It was like, he said that this comes from some objectivist or something I get that objectivist is iron ran Massimo. And it's just so cavalier, which the way he treats it.
2929980	2936980	But I like the way you definitely one of the article, the people who take iron ran more seriously as well.
2936980	2954980	Yeah, so what one of the, the one of the points I make in the article is that, yeah, that you can laugh at how crude, the foolish Massimo Piliucci is, and if jibes are, but it's basically the same thing is going on in the Rachel's textbook.
2954980	2980980	It's just, you know, more, it's a more clever than, than what he does. And I don't want to put Mike humor in this, in this camp, I think in fairness to him. He actually treats her with the level of respect that professional philosophers treat each other when they're criticizing each other.
2981980	2997980	Like, it's a lot of times you get back and forth like, well, you didn't really get me right. This isn't, but it's like, no, he gives the sites paragraphs that he's getting drawing his points from and, and there it's just more like you could have a serious, I like, I think he's, you could have a serious back and forth with him.
2997980	3006980	I don't think you could with Rachel's or Piliucci or Sidney Hook or some of the others I cite.
3006980	3011980	So we've been talking about the critics right now of Inrand.
3011980	3020980	But my guess is there are ways in which even fans of Inrand or could be parochial in their thinking as well.
3020980	3035980	Parochial thinking isn't restricted to critics of Inrand. So it's a kind of general kind of phenomenon, a way of approaching ideas from a kind of local limited perspective where you're not fully aware that you're taking for granted a lot of things that are at issue.
3035980	3044980	And then are there ways in which you think even fans of Inrand can be parochial and ways in which, if so, we can avoid that.
3044980	3054980	Well, you mentioned the value of the history of philosophy for, for breaking out of your parochial habits. I mean, like I say in the article, this is kind of the default way.
3054980	3063980	Where, where else would you start, but with what you're already familiar with and comfortable with? Like, that's sure that there's nothing wrong with starting that way.
3063980	3069980	But then you also want to be self conscious. Like, yeah, there's a whole wider world out there that I'm not, you know, not familiar with.
3069980	3086980	There's different ways of thinking about things. And part of, especially if you're into Inrand and you're like an undergrad, one of the best things you can do is just seek out other philosophies and like think about,
3087980	3100980	Okay, the Plato approaches it this way. Inrand approaches it that way. Like try to understand why there's a difference there and really think about who's right and what is Plato assuming that I'm not or that Inrand's not, what is she back and forth.
3100980	3106980	And you can, you know, you can do the same thing with your professors, get criticisms from them.
3106980	3120980	And can I really answer this? And do I, do I know what's, what, where he's coming from? Is it just a, you know, is he just being more like Massimo Pealeucci, just straight up misrepresenting things?
3120980	3126980	Or is he being more thoughtful, like a more like a Nozick or a bicumor? And do I have answers to these things? And if I don't, what does that mean?
3126980	3135980	That's, that's the best thing you could do to train yourself to just question your own assumptions, question your own premises, check your own premises, is to have them challenged?
3135980	3137980	Yeah, I mean, a lot of times you're assuming.
3137980	3142980	You're assuming straight out of Inrand's attitude toward a proper methodology.
3142980	3150980	A lot of times, a lot of times you don't know you're holding something as an assumption, as a premise, until you encounter somebody who doesn't.
3151980	3161980	And then it's like, what, what, they seem stupid. And this is what I say in the, in the article about, like, the way Rand looks to some of these people who are criticizing her.
3161980	3173980	Like, she's disputing assumptions so basic that they don't, that they have that they don't even, like, bother debating about talking about, and then she doesn't share them.
3174980	3179980	And it's like, who is this weird person who doesn't know that everything is like math?
3179980	3180980	Like, who doesn't know that?
3180980	3181980	Like, we all know this.
3181980	3184980	And then what we're saying here is it goes the other way too.
3184980	3196980	Yeah, for a lot of people, including myself, reading Inrand as a young person was my introduction to philosophy.
3196980	3203980	I mean, I heard the word philosophy, but I hadn't studied any particular philosopher before I read the fountain head and out the shrugged and then everything.
3203980	3211980	And it was like, and of course, I ran introduced me to the subject of philosophy, in part via her own philosophy, but also her treatment of other philosophers.
3211980	3216980	And so that's what I sort of took for granted, sort of at the outset.
3217980	3221980	Now, I went on to study philosophy and take other philosophers quite seriously.
3221980	3223980	And I benefited enormously from that.
3223980	3231980	But there is that sense in which you get introduced, many people get introduced to philosophy and to other philosophers via Inrand's philosophy and what she thinks of those other philosophers.
3231980	3235980	And then they can come in and spouting off things about Kant and the never read Kant.
3235980	3240980	It's that kind of thing, which must be just as irritating to a Kant scholar.
3240980	3243980	Yeah, this is his view. And it's like, have you ever read Kant?
3243980	3252980	Well, no, but I mean, that's would be just that's the sort of analog of what's so irritating to us when people treat Inrand that way.
3252980	3259980	It goes both ways. And the solution goes both ways is applicable to both.
3260980	3271980	I mean, a good little a good little test for yourself is just if you're super into objectivism and you're an under like your young philosophy student want to make make the most out of your time in college.
3271980	3278980	Just a little check for yourself is when you're making an argument or a criticism of someone.
3278980	3290980	So another figure, Kant or whoever would, if somebody wrote what I or said what I just said about Rand.
3290980	3296980	How would I take that? Like, this is a complete representation. You don't know what you've read. You haven't read anything.
3296980	3300980	Yeah, if you're going into philosophy class, you say, Oh, I know all about Hume.
3300980	3306980	I didn't read Hume. I listened to Leonard Pieckoff lecture about Hume once. Now I know all about Hume.
3306980	3320980	That's a good place to start, but you don't know all about Hume. And you don't want to do the same thing that the critics are doing. You want to aspire to a better approach.
3320980	3327980	Don't don't take objectivism as if it's self evident and unquestionable.
3327980	3330980	I mean, that's that's an aspect of objectivity.
3331980	3332980	Yeah.
3332980	3340980	Yeah, so Mike's article is called Why Can't Professional Philosophers Get Rand Right? That's the one we've been talking about today.
3340980	3345980	And I also want to point people toward an article I wrote called Why Massimo Piliucci Gets Rand Wrong.
3345980	3351980	He's a prominent philosopher of science and it addresses a similar issue to the one Mike is addressing.
3352980	3367980	I also want to point people toward a companion to Ein Rand. This is the book of scholarly work on Ein Rand's thought, and particularly toward chapter one, which is by Greg Salmiere, which is available online as a free PDF.
3367980	3370980	So if you click the link in the show notes, you can get that.
3370980	3380980	It's particularly important reading I think in this context because it addresses Ein Rand as a philosophical outsider and how to approach her work in that vein.
3380980	3392980	So that's it for resources for today. I think so stay tuned for next week's show. And please send questions for future podcast or future Q&A episodes to experts at Ein Rand.org.
