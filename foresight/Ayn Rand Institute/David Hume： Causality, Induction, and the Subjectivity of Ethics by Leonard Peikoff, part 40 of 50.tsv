0	13320	Well, where are we now?
13320	16360	What do we have in Hume's universe?
16360	21840	We have a bundle of impressions or experiences, images, and so on.
21840	23880	Impressions of what?
23880	25800	Nothing.
25800	29980	External world is a myth.
30620	33940	Experiences experienced by whom?
33940	35100	Nobody.
35100	38180	The self is a myth.
38180	42940	Now you might think this is as far as we can go in skepticism.
42940	46820	Impressions of nothing by nobody.
46820	50420	But there is more to go yet.
50420	58980	There is one very famous and incredibly influential point of Hume's that is almost universally accepted today by philosophers.
58980	70460	There is still one more link tying the world or tying experiences together, which must be shattered if we're to end up with a real poached egg mentality.
70460	75420	And that is the law of cause and effect.
75420	80220	Remember Barclay had believed in cause and effect coming from God.
80220	82260	Hobbes had believed in cause and effect.
82260	87060	Every major philosopher prior to Hume believed in cause and effect.
87100	93940	Hume now sets his nominalism and sensualism to work to demolish cause and effect too.
93940	97860	So now we'll look at Hume's greatest quote achievement.
97860	103020	His destruction of the law of cause and effect.
103020	105140	Well again, we follow the standard procedure.
105140	108220	Let's take the term cause.
108220	110060	What does it mean?
110060	113940	We say A causes B.
113940	115660	Take a classic simple example.
115660	118340	We take a rock and throw it at a window.
118340	119460	The window shatters.
119460	123980	We say the rock caused the window to break.
123980	128420	What does it mean to say one thing caused another?
128420	133700	Well says Hume, people think that there are three points involved.
133700	135980	Two of them as we'll see are OK.
135980	141020	One, the vital one proves to be meaningless.
141020	146300	Well one thing involved in the causal relationship is spatial contiguity.
146300	149140	Togetherness in space.
149140	155300	The rock actually touches the window for instance in the process of it breaking.
155300	156620	Well that's very simple.
156620	159740	We can see the two of them in direct physical contact.
159740	165740	So we have a direct perceptual reference for the phrase spatial contiguity or spatial togetherness.
165740	168380	And therefore that's perfectly meaningful.
168380	170420	But that of course is not enough.
170460	175380	Causal relationship also involves temporal contiguity.
175380	180740	The window breaks immediately after in time the rock strikes.
180740	185740	And again says Hume, that's a perfectly respectable phrase temporal contiguity
185740	191740	because we can observe one thing happening immediately after another in time
191740	195100	and therefore that is perfectly meaningful.
195140	202660	But spatial and temporal contiguity after all do not yet give us the essence of the causal relationship.
202660	206700	A coincidence can have these two characteristics.
206700	210900	For instance suppose I casually touch this lecture.
210900	218820	And while I'm in direct contact with it spatially, at the next instant it suddenly gives off,
218820	223940	I don't know, 13 bombs in the whole room and whole building come down.
223940	229740	Well you would say maybe the two events were spatially and temporally connected
229740	231500	but that simply is a coincidence.
231500	233300	There's no causal connection.
233300	237780	Maybe someone in the next room let off a bomb at the same instant.
237780	244340	What is the crucial factor, the vital ingredient in the concept of causal connection?
244340	248740	Well says Hume, it is necessary connection.
248740	253580	Not only spatial and temporal contiguity but necessary connection.
253620	259460	When we say A causes B, we mean more than simply the two go together in space
259460	261620	and the two go together in time.
261620	265900	We mean that the first necessitates the second.
265900	269940	That the two have a compulsory connection to each other.
269940	273980	That granted the first the second must happen.
273980	277380	That the first produces the second.
277380	280220	That the first makes the second happen.
280220	285540	Etc. All those being synonyms for necessary connection.
285540	293980	Well now let us put this strand, necessary connection to the test of the theory of meaning.
293980	304020	Do we ever perceive or form an image of necessary connection between events?
304020	305620	Now watch it very closely.
305620	312060	I don't have a window here to demonstrate but you just have to project that I take a rock
312060	317020	and I throw it at the window and you see the rock sailing slowly across the room.
317020	323100	Then you see, now you can stand there you right next to the wall with a magnifying glass to watch.
323100	326700	You see the rock moving, touch the window.
326700	330180	So far there's no necessity, there's just a rock, right?
330180	333420	The next thing you see the fragment shattered, right?
333420	341060	Now no little flag came out and said, the next event is unavoidable.
341060	347940	There was no booming voice from the sky that said, what comes now has to be.
347940	354740	There was no Doris Day saying K-Sara-Sara.
354740	359340	We perceive that two events go together in space and time, that's all.
359340	364420	We never come in contact with any such phenomenon as necessity.
364420	366060	What is necessity like?
366060	367420	Is it red?
367420	368740	Is it loud?
368740	370460	Is it a heart?
370460	373620	Well, can you form an image of it?
373620	374940	What does it look like?
374940	376980	What would it taste like?
376980	380380	Obviously we cannot form a perceptive necessity.
380380	383940	We cannot form an image of necessity.
384020	390220	It must therefore be an utterly meaningless term.
390220	395780	The phrase necessary connection must be just noise, like gloop.
395780	400860	And so of course must any of its synonyms, the synonym of nonsense is nonsense.
400860	404540	And therefore when you say one thing produces another or makes it happen or
404540	410660	given the first, the second must happen, all of those are equally meaningless.
410660	417780	Now let's have Hume speak for himself on this, quote.
417780	422140	First, he states his nominalism and sensualism, quote.
422140	426020	It seems a proposition which will not admit of much dispute,
426020	431820	that all our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions.
431820	433300	That's his sensualism, you see.
433300	438620	An idea is simply a faded copy of your sense experience.
438620	440460	To be fully acquainted, I'm continuing the quote.
440460	445500	To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of necessary connection,
445500	447740	let us examine its impression.
449060	451980	In order to find the impression with greater certainty,
451980	456380	let us search forward in all the sources from which it may possibly be derived.
457660	462660	Now, unquote, now he conducts a scrupulous search all over the place,
462660	465540	looking for a necessary connection if only he could find it.
465540	471300	And, quote, when we look about us towards external objects and
471300	477300	consider the operation of causes, we are never able in a single instance to
477300	480100	discover any power or necessary connection.
481220	485020	Any quality which binds the effect to the cause and
485020	488740	renders the one an infallible consequence of the other.
488740	494820	We only find that the one does actually, in fact, follow the other.
494820	498740	There is not in any single particular instance of cause and
498740	504780	effect anything which can suggest the idea of necessary connection, unquote.
506300	511980	Well, if an idea is a name for a fading experience,
511980	516220	a copy of an experience, and there is no experience of necessary connection,
516220	521860	there is no idea of necessary connection, the phrase must be meaningless.
521860	528140	When, therefore, you take a knife and put it in somebody's heart and twist it.
528140	530940	One event is observing the knife go in, and
530940	535380	the next event is you see the man turn pale and lie down on the ground.
535380	539380	And those are two events that are spatially and temporally contiguous, and
539380	540740	that's it.
540740	543140	You cannot say one made the other happen.
544460	547220	All you have a right to assert, in fact,
547220	551260	the only thing that is meaningful to us is that the two events go together in
551260	552220	space and time.
553940	559300	You observe that one is right next to the other, that one is right after the other,
559300	562540	but you can't observe that one is because of the other.
563660	566860	And of course, that's right, you can't observe the causality.
568700	573100	Well, why do you think that there is a necessary relationship?
574420	579700	If, in fact, this is a myth, again, because you have an overactive imagination.
580700	584740	In this case, you have a hyperactive associative mechanism.
586020	589980	Two events, which in fact have no necessary connection, or
589980	592020	if it would be meaningless to say so.
592020	597100	Two events happen by chance to go together so
597100	602020	many times in your experience, that after a while you form the habit,
602020	607980	simply by custom, by conditioning, to expect the second when you encounter the first.
607980	611980	That is the source of the irrational idea of necessary connection.
612940	618700	You observe, says Hume, repeated conjunctions, repeated conjunctions.
618700	622020	Two events, which happen to go together repeatedly.
622020	625660	And you begin to associate the two and expect the second after the first.
625660	629780	For instance, suppose you were brought up by an irrational mother.
630820	635420	And for no reason at all, every morning when you sat down
635420	640220	by breakfast, at breakfast to drink a glass of orange juice.
640220	643940	Just as you picked the glass of orange juice up, she had a huge strap and
643940	646260	she smashed the kitchen table with it.
647260	648980	Now, on this happened day after day.
648980	651580	There's no causal connection, but that's just the kind of mother you have.
653420	658620	After a while, as you pick up the oranges, you flinch in the expectation of the strap.
658620	664020	And you come to associate the two, you see, simply by quantity of repetition.
664020	668940	Well, Hume says this is exactly the relationship in every case where we
668940	669980	assert causal effect.
669980	670860	That's not his example.
672620	677180	Causality is simply a subjective expectation on our part.
677180	680380	Completely irrational without any justification.
682260	687500	You can use the word cause if you want, but then all it means is
687500	692700	two events are repeatedly conjoined up to now in our experience.
692700	698180	Then we, therefore, have the accompanying irrational, baseless expectation
698180	701420	that there's some connection between them.
701420	704260	But in fact, there is no connection.
704260	707660	I think I have one more quote from Hume on this.
712060	713780	Quote, famous conclusion.
714780	719900	All events seem entirely loose and separate.
719900	720980	Loose and separate.
721940	727460	One event follows another, but we never can observe any tie between them.
727460	731580	They seem conjoined, but never connected.
731580	736860	And as we have no idea of anything which never appeared to our senses,
736860	742660	the conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connection at all.
742660	747260	And that this word is absolutely without any meaning when employed either in
747260	750460	philosophical reasoning or common life.
750460	751820	Unquote.
751820	754220	That's uncompromising Humean statement.
756060	758700	Now, suppose you can test this and say, oh, that's ridiculous.
758700	761620	Causality is not simply a matter of habit.
761620	764260	Causal sequences are necessary.
764260	766900	Their opposites are literally inconceivable.
766900	770260	We couldn't even imagine their opposites happening.
770260	772940	Hume comes back with a famous example.
772940	777460	He says, you can't perfectly well imagine the opposite happening.
778980	783100	He gives the example of Adam, of course, he doesn't believe in Adam.
783100	786340	Doesn't believe in anything, but it's just as an example of the first man.
787340	789980	Now, Adam across the garden sees a flame.
791980	798140	Is Adam able to know before he experiences the behavior of the flame?
798140	802420	That the flame is going to consume him if he puts his hand into it.
803300	807780	No, he says, Adam hasn't the faintest idea how this orange
807780	813580	tongue that's flickering is going to behave when he puts his hand into it.
813580	819300	Prior to experience, if we asked Adam, is it gonna make you six feet taller,
819300	823020	burn your hand off, or turn you into a pumpkin, Adam would say, I haven't a clue.
824780	828300	Well, it says, Hume, what has he got after experience?
828300	830300	After experience, he's got a burned hand.
831300	835620	But he doesn't have any more understanding of why this took place.
835620	840260	As far as you can see, the fire could just as well have turned him into ice or
840260	841060	into a pumpkin.
842620	848980	In other words, it simply is a matter of brute fact that it happens to be the case
848980	853980	that fire up to now burns or warms.
853980	856940	But it's unintelligible why this is so, and
856940	859700	we can easily conceive the opposite.
861180	866420	Now, if someone were to say that we can explain by reference to scientific law,
866420	871620	why fire does what it does, Hume would say scientific law.
871620	874660	Scientific law is based on cause and effect.
874660	877300	Cause and effect depends on necessary connection, and
877300	880060	that's meaningless, so much for scientific laws.
881620	886340	All we do is we let our familiarity with certain arbitrary
886340	891700	sequences delude us into thinking that the connection is intelligible,
891700	893660	when actually it's completely unintelligible.
894860	899980	Well, suppose you try to give Hume a proof in logic,
899980	903420	that every event must have a cause that necessitates it.
905220	908460	Well, Hume says, go ahead and try, and
908460	911140	I'll show you that you can't give me any such proof.
911140	917100	Is your proof going to rely on reason, he says?
917100	920060	You answer, well, certainly I'm going to give a rational proof.
921340	926220	Well, says Hume, by reason we can only prove truths whose opposites
926220	930900	would be contradictory, logical contradictions.
930900	933660	Reason teaches us that we have to believe something because
933660	935940	the opposite would be a contradiction.
935940	939420	So we can prove that two and two is four because if somebody denied it,
939420	941460	we could show him he was contradicting himself.
943020	947860	Now, anything which is a contradiction is inconceivable.
947860	950340	You can't conceive around square, for instance,
950340	952900	because it's the two sides annihilate each other.
954940	959540	Now, is there any difficulty in conceiving that the law of cause and
959540	961860	effect is false?
961860	966380	Would any contradiction be involved, he asks, in conceiving it?
966380	970500	No, the opposite of the law of cause and effect, he says,
970500	972740	is perfectly conceivable.
972740	974340	It's easy to understand.
974340	980340	It's not like a round square which obliterates it itself.
980340	982500	It's perfectly conceivable.
983700	990140	Take that idea, there are events which don't have any causes.
990140	994900	Now, if this was a contradiction, we shouldn't even be able to grasp it.
994900	996540	It should be like married bachelor.
997540	1000820	But says, Hume, there's no difficulty in grasping this.
1000820	1003780	Just imagine, I'm making up the example, but this is his idea.
1003780	1006700	Imagine you're walking down the street and
1006700	1011860	suddenly an apple pops into existence out of thin air.
1011860	1014980	Nothing preceded it, it's not a hallucination.
1014980	1018060	It just is there without any cause.
1018060	1019260	Walt Disney could drop.
1020980	1024140	Now says, Hume, this is perfectly conceivable.
1024140	1025660	There's no contradiction in it.
1025660	1027780	If there were a contradiction, you couldn't conceive it.
1027780	1031300	But you understood my story, so you must be able to conceive it.
1031300	1034140	Whereas if I said a round square popped out,
1034140	1035500	you'd say, I don't know what that is.
1036820	1039380	If it's conceivable, there's no contradiction.
1039380	1042380	If there's no contradiction, reason can't prove it.
1042380	1045580	Reason only proves something whose opposite is a contradiction.
1045580	1049700	Therefore, the law of cause and effect cannot be proved.
1049700	1052100	Since it can't be proved in reason, and
1052100	1056140	we know there's no basis for it in reference to experience,
1057180	1062060	we conclude the law of cause and effect is bereft of any foundation of any kind.
1062060	1067380	In reason or in experience, it is therefore simply a myth.
1069900	1076420	Now, of course, the objections to this Humean viewpoint are legion.
1076420	1079380	Since this is the last time I'll get my licks in it,
1079380	1083300	you might keep interrupting each point because I can't put it off anymore
1083300	1085340	that, of course, having running out.
1085340	1086860	But let me just indicate briefly.
1088300	1093660	Notice that Hume assumes that if he can visualize an event that takes place
1093660	1098580	allegedly without a cause, that that's the same as saying he conceives it
1098580	1099700	without contradiction.
1100660	1104620	Now, of course, if Aristotle heard this argument, he would say,
1105620	1109900	you are visualizing an event which implies a contradiction.
1110900	1114980	And therefore, you are actually conceiving nothing but an irrational
1114980	1117460	figment of your own imagination.
1117460	1120860	You have an image, but not a logical concept.
1121860	1123900	What would Hume's answer be if he heard that?
1125260	1126380	What's the difference?
1127620	1129460	An image is a concept.
1129460	1133060	If I can form an image of something, I've formed a concept of it.
1133260	1136100	That, of course, is his nominalism.
1136100	1137500	Concept is an image.
1138420	1141060	So if you can form an image, you can form a concept.
1141060	1145100	And if you can form a concept, then it's obviously logically possible.
1145100	1150260	Therefore, if you can form an image, any arbitrary fantastic image,
1150260	1153220	the thing it stands for is logically possible.
1153220	1158300	That is the end result of reducing concepts to images the way the nominalists do.
1158300	1164940	Now, you might think you would satisfy Hume if you gave him the proof of cause and
1164940	1167340	effect that we developed from Aristotle's philosophy.
1168380	1171620	You remember the argument which had essentially two premises.
1171620	1176300	Actions are actions of entities, and entities have identity.
1176300	1179820	They are what they are, the law of identity, and therefore,
1179820	1183980	to make a long story short, they can only act in accordance with their nature.
1183980	1189900	Now, if you were to reincarnate David Hume and give him this argument,
1189900	1192220	he wouldn't bat an eye or turn a hair.
1193820	1201020	Because observe each premise, entities, he would say, what is that?
1201020	1204700	All we have are loose, floating bundles of qualities.
1204700	1208660	And that's all that he as a nominalist sensualist can encounter.
1208660	1213500	And therefore, the premise about entities existing is already out.
1213500	1217580	And so is therefore the base of any proof of cause and effect given his nominalist.
1217580	1223340	And as for the law of identity, is that supposed to be a necessary general truth?
1223340	1227820	Well, then, as a nominalist, that, of course, must be linguistic,
1227820	1229980	semantic, just the way you use words.
1229980	1231100	It doesn't say anything.
1232060	1238620	Now, you see, in other words, causality has already comes fairly far down a philosophy.
1238620	1244540	You first of all have to have the conceptual level to validate your knowledge of anything,
1244540	1245980	including of causality.
1247180	1252700	So there's actually nothing new to answer in Hume's attack on cause and effect.
1252700	1258220	If you can answer his nominalism and sensualism, if you can defend a valid theory of concepts,
1258860	1262380	then his whole attack on cause and effect crashes to the ground,
1262380	1264300	along with the whole rest of his philosophy.
1264940	1268620	And of course, if you cannot answer his nominalism and sensualism,
1269180	1272460	then you are lost and everything is lost.
1273180	1279020	And you see, again, the crucial importance of a valid theory of concepts.
1281340	1289340	In any event, for Hume, the collapse of cause and effect leads to overwhelming insoluble problems.
1290060	1293980	It leads him to complete and total skepticism.
1295260	1299980	Because if there is no cause and effect, how can we predict the future?
1301100	1302540	How can we generalize?
1303980	1307820	How can we say that because things have happened a certain way in the past,
1308380	1310700	therefore they will happen that way in the future?
1311340	1313900	How can we ever formulate scientific laws?
1313900	1319980	How can we even have science to all of which Hume's answer is, you can't.
1320380	1328300	We have, he says, no reason on earth to assume that nature follows law.
1329420	1332700	We have no reason to assume that nature is uniform.
1332700	1336460	We have no reason to assume that the future will be like the past.
1337820	1340860	This is known as the problem of induction.
1341580	1347420	And the problem of induction is what makes you think that because something has happened
1347500	1352220	a certain way repeatedly in the past, it will therefore happen that way in the future.
1353180	1359660	Now, of course, if there are necessary connections in reality, if there are actual laws
1359660	1366220	which nature must obey, then you can validly generalize from experience under the appropriate
1366220	1374620	circumstances. But if you destroy causality and you reduce it, nature, to simply unintelligible,
1374700	1381340	brute conjunction of events without any necessity, then anything is possible at the next instant.
1382060	1386860	And the fact that something has happened a thousand times proves nothing about the future.
1387580	1390540	It's simply been a run of coincidence.
1392140	1394940	Now, people often misunderstand Hume.
1395900	1400300	And they think he is saying, well, you can never be certain about the future.
1400300	1404860	You can only have a degree of probability. He goes much beyond that.
1405660	1411340	He says you can't even have the faintest trace of probability with regard to the future.
1411980	1418140	Every occurrence is a brand new event. All events are loose and separate.
1418140	1422380	There is no necessity about any conjunction of events.
1422940	1428460	And therefore, you haven't the slightest reason, he says, to assume that the future will resemble
1428460	1436780	the past in any respect. If I throw a penny up in the air, now up to now, the penny has come down.
1437580	1441820	And you might be inclined to say, well, there's a good chance it'll come down again.
1442620	1447260	But of course, in Hume's philosophy, there's only one chance in infinity that it will come down.
1449420	1455660	It might still stand still. It might go straight up. It might turn into a hagel.
1455660	1461020	It might become a quarter. It could do anything.
1462300	1466780	Now you say, but it's become, it's come down so many times in the past.
1466780	1471820	Well, I've heard Hume and say that just goes to show that we have had such a run of good luck
1471820	1480540	that we shouldn't expect it to continue. That's known as the problem of induction.
1480700	1487180	Well, we've reached a total dead end, an absolutely shattered universe.
1487180	1495820	We have loosely floating qualities, no entities, no reality, no self, no causality,
1496380	1502620	everything a brute contingent fact. Now let's mop up some final points.
1503180	1510700	Is there any necessary knowledge, according to Hume, anything we can know as necessary?
1511580	1519500	Yes, he says, but not matters of fact. Not matters of fact. Anything which talks about the way things
1519500	1529980	actually are, any factual statement is contingent. We derive it from experience. It is empirical.
1530780	1536460	Aposteriora, using the term I introduced last time, which means dependent on experience.
1537180	1546300	Well, then where do we get necessary knowledge of? Only in what Hume calls relations of ideas.
1548140	1554460	If I, out of the statement, bachelors are male, I can know that that has to be true.
1554460	1563660	Because, says Hume, it is a matter of definition. I define bachelor as an entity one of whose
1563660	1569660	characteristics is being male, and therefore this is a necessary truth. I can count on it,
1569660	1575900	but it doesn't tell me anything about facts. It would be true even if there are no bachelors.
1576780	1586380	It's necessary simply because we make it so by our arbitrary nominalistic definitions. If it's
1586380	1592300	stated an actual fact of reality, he would say, how would you ever know it is necessary?
1593100	1600140	Therefore this kind of truth, the so-called relations of ideas, we arrive at that by reason
1600220	1605660	or thought or analysis. In their case, the opposite would be a contradiction.
1606460	1613420	They are learned by definition, not by experience. They are so-called a priori.
1614140	1619260	And so we have the standard dichotomy that we have seen in so many different forms,
1620380	1626940	as it exists in Hume, the linguistic truths versus the existential or factual truths,
1626940	1633580	the logical truths versus the factual truths, the truths of reason which are necessary but
1633580	1642220	detached from reality, and the truths of experience which pertain to fact but are contingent.
1642780	1649900	You see this is a variant of the standard dichotomy, and this is what Kahn then picked up
1649900	1655580	and called the analytic, the truths versus the synthetic, the analytic being the ones you arrive
1655580	1661500	at by analysis, the logical truths so-called, and the synthetic being the ones that tell you
1661500	1669740	actual empirical information. Now, given this, which is therefore not original with Hume,
1671660	1678780	what happens to metaphysics if you accept this dichotomy of the necessary relations of ideas
1678780	1686220	which are linguistic versus the contingent factual empirical truths? Well, is metaphysics
1687020	1692860	supposed to be factual? Well, the advocates of metaphysics say certainly metaphysics tells you
1692860	1700620	facts about reality. Well, if it's factual, it has to be empirical. Is metaphysics supposed to
1700620	1707260	therefore tell you simply contingent empirical hypotheses? No, the advocates of metaphysical
1707260	1712540	principles like cause and effect, for instance, say they are necessary. Well, there's no such
1712540	1720540	possibility as a factual necessary truth. If it's necessary, it's simply linguistic. If it's factual,
1720540	1727100	it is not necessary. Is metaphysics supposed to be linguistic? No, say its advocates. Is
1727100	1732780	metaphysics supposed to be contingent then? No, say its advocates. Well, then says Hume,
1732780	1740940	metaphysics as such is out into the fire with it. There is no room for any such subject.
1741980	1745820	If you come and say to Hume, but what about existence exists?
1748140	1754940	A is A. Consciousness is the faculty for perceiving reality. Every event has a cause,
1754940	1758940	he would say to you. Do you mean those propositions as expression of your arbitrary
1759020	1763180	linguistic usage? You would say certainly not. I mean those to be facts of reality.
1763980	1769580	He would say, did you arrive at them by sensory perception and do you regard them as simply
1769580	1775820	contingent truths? You say certainly not. Those are laws and principles of reality. Say no such
1775820	1783820	category. It's either a subjective relation of ideas, or it is a brute contingent sensualist
1783820	1789500	type fact. Therefore, as far as metaphysics is concerned, throw it into the fire.
1792300	1797500	A viewpoint echoed in the 20th century by many schools who are simply neo-Humia.
1799180	1806780	The upshot in Hume's viewpoint is this. If you are certain about a proposition, if you understand
1806780	1813580	why it must be true, if it's really reliable, it's detached from reality. And on the other hand,
1813580	1819420	if it has something to say about the real world, you can't be certain about it and you can't make
1819420	1825980	any sense of it. If you know it must be true, then it's not about the world. It says nothing about
1825980	1831900	facts, it just expresses linguistic conventions. If it says something about facts, then it is
1831900	1840060	contingent, uncertain, unreliable. If you prove it by experience, it's contingent and unreliable.
1840060	1846460	If you prove it by logic, it simply is an arbitrary convention. So you're trapped either way.
1846460	1851660	You cannot win, you end up in a complete skepticism.
1853580	1861100	Now let us look briefly at some final topics from Hume, which we can race through briefly because
1861100	1869580	the essence of his philosophy you now know. Human God. Well, of course, God cannot survive
1869660	1877180	on a Humean philosophy. God is supposed to be a spiritual substance who is the cause of the world.
1878060	1883820	Well, every item in that statement is gone. There is no world, no spiritual substance,
1883820	1893660	and no causality. And consequently, God is out. And Hume takes great delight in demolishing God.
1893660	1897020	He's particularly interested in the argument from design. You know, the
1897900	1905900	reader's digest teleological argument. And he loves to take on religious people and make mincemeat
1905900	1912300	of their viewpoint. Now there are passages in Hume which indicate that religion is still a sensitive
1912300	1918460	subject in his opinion and that he is loath to come out as a complete atheist, but obviously any
1918460	1924380	belief in God would be completely incompatible with his philosophy. In essence, his view would be
1924380	1931020	that God as a term is radically different from anything a sensualist can come in contact with,
1931020	1936620	and therefore it's simply a meaningless noise. And therefore, Hume is essentially anti-religious.
1938460	1944620	If you read his detailed arguments, I may say you would find them a mixture of astute
1945260	1950380	objections. He's a fairly good polemicist, but he's always a Humean and to untangle
1950940	1955340	his good objections from his crazy Humeanism, which are all mashed together.
1956620	1959420	It's easier to refute God on your own without help from Hume.
1963580	1971980	Now, the effects of Hume's assault on God were that, combined with other influences, he was only
1971980	1979660	one, but he contributed heavily to the fact that after this period, no influential philosopher
1980220	1985980	attempted to prove the existence of God in reason. Kant was very religious, but he did not think
1985980	1995420	you could prove God in reason. Hegel, well, Hegel is Hegel, and his God is hardly the same as anybody
1995420	2002380	else's God. Nietzsche said correctly in the 19th century, God is dead, meaning religion was a
2002380	2008780	dead issue. And in the 20th century, one whole school derivative from Hume and Kant says that
2008780	2016940	God is simply a noise like gloop. It stands for nothing at all. And another school says that
2016940	2023100	if you do believe in God, you have to go by absurd feelings because God is not graspable by reason.
2023980	2031900	So God never survived the 18th century philosophically. He never again had the importance
2031900	2039420	that he did in Descartes' Bonot's Alarmus Locke Barclay. Now, there are people who think that this
2039420	2047020	is good, and that Hume has done a great service combined with a few other philosophers in getting
2047020	2055340	rid of God. I would not agree with that. Because as an objectivist, I would say the concept of God
2055340	2065500	is bad because it is anti-reason and anti-reality. But in Hume, God is thrown out along with reason
2065500	2072940	and reality on the same grounds. And this is a very, very bad mixture. Now, I remember once
2072940	2079980	talking to a brash sophomore, this was 20 years ago, and I asked him if he believed in God.
2080540	2089900	And he said, of course not. God doesn't exist. Nothing does. Now, that is the Humean mentality.
2091020	2097180	And it helps to explain to you why it is a mistake to call objectivism atheism.
2097820	2105340	Objectivists are atheists. We deny the existence of God. But all sorts of people deny the existence
2105340	2111340	of God, including Hume and the Communists for different reasons. And therefore, to know that
2111340	2117980	somebody is an atheist is to tell you nothing about the essence of his philosophy. It simply
2117980	2123660	tells you that there is one aberration he did not commit. But that leaves open a terrific field.
2126380	2133340	Now, on ethics, to say a word about Hume's view on that question, it should be obvious
2133900	2139420	that his ethics is compatible with the rest of his philosophy. In other words, it is a thoroughly
2139420	2149820	skeptical subjectivist ethics. The question he raises is, how can you ever defend an ethical
2149820	2157340	or evaluative proposition? If we have to base everything on experience, experience only tells
2157340	2163820	us what is the case? How do we ever get a knowledge of what ought to be the case?
2165580	2176300	Did you ever touch a desirability? Did you ever smell a goodness? Obviously, valued terms. You cannot
2176300	2182540	grasp or imbibe through the senses or images. And if that is our only means of cognition,
2182540	2188860	there is obviously no way to validate value premises. So here we have the old problem of
2188860	2195420	deriving values from facts. And of course, Hume declares it can't be done. In fact, there's a
2195420	2202940	parallel here. Just as he claims, you can't get a must out of an is. You can't get a necessary
2202940	2209580	connection out of a fact. So he says, you can't get an evaluation out of an is. You can't get an
2209660	2217180	ought out of it is. You can't get a value out of a fact. And therefore, value judgments are
2217180	2226140	gratuitously arbitrary in their foundation. No rational ethics is possible. Ethics must begin
2226140	2232060	with subjective desires and feelings. And when we say something is right or some equivalent value
2232060	2239980	term, we ultimately must mean that is what we desire. Ethics is a matter of feeling.
2242860	2248060	Reason therefore says Hume is and must be a slave of the passions.
2250700	2258860	In other words, we have again, essentially the softest viewpoint in ethics. Now there's nothing
2258940	2264460	new, therefore, in his ethics. It's the same skepticism as in the rest of his philosophy.
2265420	2270140	And the answer to his specific charge that you cannot get values out of fact is contained.
2270940	2273820	Well, it's contained in Galt's speech, and it's also in the
2274620	2278860	objectivist ethics, the essay by Ms. Rand. So I won't comment on that further.
2281420	2285580	To summarize Hume's philosophy, I think the best thing is to let him summarize.
2286300	2293420	This is a quote from him in which he expresses his arch skepticism, quote. I read you these
2293420	2298700	because they're famous and explicit. And because he's British, they're intelligible, quote.
2300540	2305740	"'Tis not solely in poetry and music, we must follow our taste and sentiment,
2305740	2311660	but likewise in philosophy. When I am convinced of any principle,
2311660	2318380	it is only an idea which strikes more strongly upon me. When I give the preference to one set
2318380	2325100	of arguments above another, I do nothing but decide from my feeling concerning the superiority
2325100	2332860	of their influence. Objects have no discoverable connection together, nor is it from any other
2332860	2339340	principle but custom operating upon the imagination that we can draw any inference from the appearance
2339340	2349420	of one to the existence of another.'" In other words, nobody can know anything. This is arch,
2349420	2357260	complete skepticism, absolute bankruptcy, philosophy, idea, science, theory, it's all a
2357260	2362700	matter of taste and feeling. Now you say you can't live by this philosophy,
2364460	2369100	and you think that that is an objection to Hume. Well, you may or may not be surprised to
2369100	2376860	know that Hume agrees with you. He says quite explicitly, no, you cannot live by this philosophy.
2377580	2382300	He says in a famous passage, which I won't take the time to read, but what it amounts to is that
2382860	2389420	he writes this material showing that external world is meaningless and self is meaningless
2389420	2395180	and causality is meaningless and so on. Then he says he leaves his writing and he goes and dines
2395260	2403180	with friends, he plays a game of backgammon, he uses that example, and he lives in the normal
2403180	2409820	world with everybody else, and then he says he comes back and reads what he wrote, and it seems
2409820	2417580	to him so strained and ridiculous he wants to throw it all out, but he can't find anything wrong with
2417580	2428540	it. Why is his solution to this dilemma? The solution he says is skepticism is a disease
2429260	2437340	that comes from living by reason, and the only way out is simply pay no attention to the conclusions
2437340	2445420	of reason. Quote, this skeptical doubt, both with respect to reason and the senses, is a
2445420	2451820	malady which can never be radically cured but must return upon us every moment, however we
2451820	2459500	may chase it away. Carelessness and inattention, carelessness and inattention alone can afford
2459500	2469980	us any remedy. For this reason, I rely entirely upon them and take it for granted whatever may
2469980	2474700	be the reader's opinion at this present moment that an hour hence he will be persuaded that
2474700	2484140	there is both an external and internal world. You get the idea. In other words, you cannot live by
2484140	2491660	philosophy, you have to be careless and inattentive to it because you can't live by reason, and you
2491660	2500060	do not have to, because we are not only rational creatures, we are also natural creatures, which
2500060	2507900	means we have instincts, we have imaginations, we have feelings, and our feelings and imaginations
2507900	2514780	and instincts will invent the fictions we need and will take us through life prosperously as long
2514780	2521020	as we pay no attention to reason and philosophy. If you think you've got a reason for believing what
2521020	2528140	you do, you haven't. Your actual, the actual, I can't even say cause because there are no causes,
2528140	2537420	but the actual something or other of your beliefs is simply instinct, quote, famous line of humor.
2537420	2545260	If we believe that fire warms or water refreshes, it is only because it costs us too much pains
2545260	2554060	to think otherwise, unquote. Now there's just a pragmatic matter of instinct. In other words,
2554060	2562700	in the last analysis, irrational, unphilosophical, unthinking, blind, instinct is superior to reason,
2562700	2570380	thought, and philosophy. That's the final upshot of humans philosophy. Reason is impotent, nobody
2570380	2577100	can know anything. Reason can't give you a knowledge of reality. External reality is a myth, entities
2577100	2583260	are a myth, the self is a myth, cause and effect is a myth, logic is a subjective construction,
2583260	2589020	nobody has any reason to believe anything. You can live only if you ignore reason and function by
2589020	2595900	irrational instinct, only if you throw a reason and philosophy into the fire and follow your irrational
2595900	2602300	passions. Now you see this is the end result of trying to philosophize, having invalidated
2603020	2607980	the conceptual faculty. And one of two things had to happen at this point.
2608780	2616540	Either a champion of reason in a valid sense had to appear, somebody who finally validated
2616540	2625020	man's conceptual faculty, or the arch destroyer of all time would appear and put the final seal
2625020	2632380	on man's philosophic demise. And the second, of course, is what happened. The man who came on
2632380	2638460	the scene right after Hume, who set himself the task of answering Hume, who said he was going to
2638460	2645420	avoid the floating constructs of the rationalists and the skepticism of the empiricists, that man
2645420	2651660	was Kant. And of course, in the process of giving his answers to these schools, he once and for all
2651660	2658300	removed reason from the philosophic scene altogether. We have now traced the story from Greece,
2658860	2663500	beginning with Thales and his friends eagerly trying for the first time to probe into the
2663500	2669660	nature of reality. And we have gone now all the way through David Hume, where the attempt
2669660	2675500	finally collapses with a sickening whimper. For tonight, that's it. Thank you very much.
2675500	2687820	And how could Hume ask, can we conceive the opposite of the law of cause and effect,
2687820	2694380	since it is a conception and it would be meaningless to begin with? No. The answer is by concept,
2694380	2700300	he would mean form an image of. Can you form an image of the opposite of cause and effect?
2700300	2705020	And he and his followers would say, yes, you could. You can form an image of an event without a
2705020	2712060	cause, namely, for instance, the apple I mentioned during the lecture. And as long as you could image
2712060	2720300	it for them, that's forming a concept of. How would Hume deal with 100% predictability? For
2720300	2725260	instance, a certain mass of rock thrown with a certain force will always break a window made a
2725260	2732060	certain way. Hume would say, you have no way whatever of knowing this. All you would know is that
2732060	2738780	up to now, that kind of rock has behaved this way, but you haven't got one reason in a million
2738780	2743660	to believe that it's going to behave that way in the future. So he would simply say, I don't
2743660	2751180	account for 100% predictability. There is no even 1% predictability. Of course, he's wrong,
2751180	2760220	but that's what he would say. By Hume's premises, how can our past experiences cause us to form a
2760220	2767580	habit and hence arrive at our false idea of cause? A good question, no answer to it. Hume
2767580	2775420	throughout gives causal explanations, alleged causal explanations of our false beliefs, our
2775420	2781660	belief in entities and the self and the external world and so on. Having denied causality,
2781660	2786780	he has no business giving such explanations, a point which is commonly made in polemics against
2787420	2791420	and therefore he has to say that our belief in causality, if he's consistent,
2792300	2801500	like causality itself, like any phenomenon of the world, is simply an inexplicable,
2801500	2808140	brute, unintelligible, contingent fact which he can't make a header tailor. And in falling
2808140	2814460	into the tendency to give a causal explanation of our mistaken belief in causality, he is using
2814460	2818220	causality while denying it and thereby contradicting his own philosophy.
2820940	2829660	If you ask Hume to put his hand, yes, in a fire a few times, and see if this would be the time
2829660	2837820	his hand wouldn't be burned, would he do it? Assuming not what would be his reason. Undoubtedly,
2837820	2843260	he wouldn't do it and he would say because he's a creature of instinct. Being a creature of instinct,
2843260	2849820	he is conditioned to expect irrationally that the flame would burn him and he prefers to live by
2849820	2859020	his irrational instinct. If Hume has to fall back on the concept of natural creatures with
2859020	2864220	instincts, emotions, and so on, doesn't he necessarily refute his original impurities
2864220	2870860	premise of no innate ideas? If so, didn't he see this and offer any explanation? Well,
2870860	2880780	you must understand that for Hume, instincts, emotions, etc., are part of the impressions
2880780	2888860	we are directly given. Just as we are directly given the simple ideas, those include certain
2888860	2895820	emotions, passions, and feelings which for Hume do not derive from our ideas or from our intellect
2895900	2901740	at all. They are simply irreducible primaries. They are part of our given empirical equipment
2902620	2909740	and therefore he feels no compulsion to offer any explanation of emotions. Emotions are simply
2909740	2916860	there. Whatever emotions we have, we have and that's it. They are raw elements like sensations with no
2916860	2921740	further explanation offered. Of course, since he offers no explanation of anything, it shouldn't
2921740	2928140	surprise you that he offers no explanation of emotions either. Why did certain philosophers
2928140	2933420	develop a preference for certain psychological processes, namely sensation and perceptions,
2933420	2938620	which stay out to be valid or meaningful and reject as meaningless or non-existent other
2938620	2943500	psychological processes such as conceptualization and understanding whose existence are equally
2943500	2949900	identifiable introspectively? Well, I tried to explain that in the process of giving the course.
2951820	2961260	They believed that concepts were not based on reality and therefore they simply reconstrued
2961260	2970140	what is in fact available introspectively. If it'll make you feel better to think of that
2970140	2974140	noise coming from the next room, it's simply a secondary quality and therefore it's not really
2974140	2984620	real. In other words, concepts do pose a certain problem that percepts don't. I'm not saying that
2984620	2991660	the conclusions of philosophers are valid, but concepts are not directly perceivable in reality
2991660	2998380	the way percepts are. Percepts represent a direct contact with reality. Concepts an indirect contact
2999020	3003740	and therefore if a philosopher says, yes, I can grasp perception but I don't know what
3003740	3010220	conception is, it represents to be sure a profound default on his philosophic tasks
3010220	3015020	since the essence of philosophy is the theory of concepts, but on the face of it it is more
3015020	3020300	intelligible and if you were to say I grasp concepts but I deny percepts because percepts
3020300	3027740	are much simpler and easier to grasp and in this sense I would offer that as a partial explanation.
3028380	3034940	But the full story is of course the whole nominalist argumentation.
