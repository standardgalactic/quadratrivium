The universe is vast and complex, and our understanding of it continues to evolve with scientific discovery. Here's a summary of the key points you've described:

1. **Observable Universe**: This is the region of space from which we can observe light, which is about 93 billion light-years in diameter. It's the part of the universe accessible to us given the finite speed of light (light from distant objects has taken this long to reach us).

2. **Size and Expansion**: The observable universe has expanded over time. Objects that emitted light billions of years ago are now even farther away because the space between them and us has been stretching.

3. **Center of the Observable Universe**: Each of us is at the center of our own observable universe, given that we can only observe space up to the horizon defined by the farthest light we receive (currently 46 billion light-years).

4. **The Whole Universe**: This is likely much larger than the observable universe and may be infinite. We cannot see or know what lies beyond our observable universe, but it has a temporal beginning, which is known as the Big Bang.

5. **No Edge or Center for the Entire Universe**: The whole universe doesn't have a spatial edge. It expands in all directions and may be infinite without boundaries. There is no single center to the entire universe; each observer within it has their own "center" based on what they can observe.

6. **Expansion of the Universe**: Space itself is expanding, which means both the observable universe and potentially the whole universe are getting bigger over time. This expansion is not uniform in all directions but generally consistent across large scales.

7. **The Big Bang**: The universe began with the Big Bang approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is the temporal edge for the whole universe. This event marked the beginning of space, time, matter, and energy as we understand them.

In summary, the observable universe is a sphere whose diameter is about 93 billion light-years across, centered on our location in the Milky Way galaxy. The entire universe may be much larger, possibly infinite, and it continues to expand, with new regions becoming observable as time passes. Our understanding of these concepts comes from observations and theories developed by cosmologists and astrophysicists.
