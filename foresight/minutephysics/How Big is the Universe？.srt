1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
The universe. How big is it? Does it have a center? Does it have an edge? Is it getting bigger? And if so, why?

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,960
Well, we know that there are two different meanings for universe. First, the observable universe is

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
everything that we've been able to see or observe thus far. And second, the universe, or the whole

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,600
universe, means everything that exists or has existed or will exist. More specifically, the

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,800
observable universe is the region of space visible to us from Earth. And since the universe is only

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,400
about 13.8 billion years old and light takes time to travel through space, then regardless of what

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,600
direction we look, we see light that's been traveling at most 13.8 billion years. So it's

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,680
logical to think that the observable universe must then be 2 times 13.77 equals 27.5 billion light

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,120
years across. But it's not. That's because over time, space has been expanding, so the distant

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,200
objects that gave off that light 13.8 billion years ago have since moved even farther away from us.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,600
Today, those distant objects are a bit more than 46 billion light years away.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,360
Multiply times 2 and you get 93 billion light years, the diameter of the observable universe.

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,680
To give you a sense of scale, the size of the Earth within the observable universe is roughly

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
equivalent to the size of a virus within the solar system. Although that doesn't help much

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,480
because we can't really appreciate the incomprehensible smallness of a virus nor the bewildering

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,240
bigness of our solar system either. So let's just say that the observable universe is stupendously big.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,400
But the whole universe, as far as we can tell, is a lot bigger. Space is most likely infinite,

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
or at least it doesn't have an edge, though the difference between those is another story

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,840
unto itself. Now, what about the center of the universe? Well, the observable universe has a

20
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,880
center. Us, we are at the center of the observable universe because the observable universe is just

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,000
the region of space visible from Earth. And kind of like how the view from a very tall tower is a

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,360
circle centered on the tower, the piece of space we can see from here is naturally centered here.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,000
In fact, if you want to be more precise, each one of us is the center of our own observable

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
universe. But that doesn't mean we're at the center of the whole universe, just like the tower

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,320
isn't the center of the world. It's the center of the piece of the world that it can see,

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,480
up to the horizon. But just because you can't see beyond the horizon doesn't mean there's

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,440
nothing there. And so it is with the observable universe. Looking up at the sky, we see light

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
that's at most 13.8 billion years old and coming from stuff that's now 46 billion light years away.

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,560
Anything farther is beyond the horizon. But each second, we see a new, even older light

30
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,440
coming from slightly farther away, three light seconds farther to be precise. And so our view

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,480
of the cosmos is literally getting bigger all the time. All we have to do is wait and watch as the

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,000
universe ages and light from more distant places has the time to get to us. So here we are, sitting

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,760
at the center of our observable piece of the whole universe. How big is the universe? Well,

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,520
the observable universe is currently 93 billion light years across. The whole universe is probably

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,120
infinite. Does the universe have an edge? The observable universe does. It's 46 billion light

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,320
years away in any direction. And the whole universe has a temporal edge, or what we call a beginning,

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,280
but almost certainly not a spatial one. Does the universe have a center? Again, the observable

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,440
universe does. You, the universe as a whole, almost certainly not. And is the universe getting bigger?

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,560
Yes, space is expanding, which makes both the observable universe and the whole universe bigger.

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,360
Plus, over time, we see older and older light coming from farther and farther away. So our

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,560
observable universe gets bigger that way too. And that, in a nutshell, is our view from the tower.

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,960
You are the center of the universe. And so am I. And so is everyone else. And so is no one.
