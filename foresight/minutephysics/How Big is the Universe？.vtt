The universe. How big is it? Does it have a center? Does it have an edge? Is it getting bigger? And if so, why?

00:07.840 --> 00:12.960
Well, we know that there are two different meanings for universe. First, the observable universe is

00:12.960 --> 00:18.320
everything that we've been able to see or observe thus far. And second, the universe, or the whole

00:18.320 --> 00:23.600
universe, means everything that exists or has existed or will exist. More specifically, the

00:23.600 --> 00:28.800
observable universe is the region of space visible to us from Earth. And since the universe is only

00:28.800 --> 00:34.400
about 13.8 billion years old and light takes time to travel through space, then regardless of what

00:34.400 --> 00:39.600
direction we look, we see light that's been traveling at most 13.8 billion years. So it's

00:39.600 --> 00:45.680
logical to think that the observable universe must then be 2 times 13.77 equals 27.5 billion light

00:45.680 --> 00:51.120
years across. But it's not. That's because over time, space has been expanding, so the distant

00:51.120 --> 00:57.200
objects that gave off that light 13.8 billion years ago have since moved even farther away from us.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.600
Today, those distant objects are a bit more than 46 billion light years away.

01:01.600 --> 01:07.360
Multiply times 2 and you get 93 billion light years, the diameter of the observable universe.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.680
To give you a sense of scale, the size of the Earth within the observable universe is roughly

01:11.680 --> 01:16.000
equivalent to the size of a virus within the solar system. Although that doesn't help much

01:16.000 --> 01:20.480
because we can't really appreciate the incomprehensible smallness of a virus nor the bewildering

01:20.480 --> 01:26.240
bigness of our solar system either. So let's just say that the observable universe is stupendously big.

01:26.240 --> 01:32.400
But the whole universe, as far as we can tell, is a lot bigger. Space is most likely infinite,

01:32.400 --> 01:36.240
or at least it doesn't have an edge, though the difference between those is another story

01:36.240 --> 01:41.840
unto itself. Now, what about the center of the universe? Well, the observable universe has a

01:41.840 --> 01:46.880
center. Us, we are at the center of the observable universe because the observable universe is just

01:46.880 --> 01:52.000
the region of space visible from Earth. And kind of like how the view from a very tall tower is a

01:52.000 --> 01:57.360
circle centered on the tower, the piece of space we can see from here is naturally centered here.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.000
In fact, if you want to be more precise, each one of us is the center of our own observable

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
universe. But that doesn't mean we're at the center of the whole universe, just like the tower

02:06.000 --> 02:10.320
isn't the center of the world. It's the center of the piece of the world that it can see,

02:10.320 --> 02:14.480
up to the horizon. But just because you can't see beyond the horizon doesn't mean there's

02:14.480 --> 02:19.440
nothing there. And so it is with the observable universe. Looking up at the sky, we see light

02:19.440 --> 02:25.120
that's at most 13.8 billion years old and coming from stuff that's now 46 billion light years away.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.560
Anything farther is beyond the horizon. But each second, we see a new, even older light

02:30.560 --> 02:35.440
coming from slightly farther away, three light seconds farther to be precise. And so our view

02:35.440 --> 02:40.480
of the cosmos is literally getting bigger all the time. All we have to do is wait and watch as the

02:40.480 --> 02:46.000
universe ages and light from more distant places has the time to get to us. So here we are, sitting

02:46.000 --> 02:51.760
at the center of our observable piece of the whole universe. How big is the universe? Well,

02:51.760 --> 02:57.520
the observable universe is currently 93 billion light years across. The whole universe is probably

02:57.520 --> 03:03.120
infinite. Does the universe have an edge? The observable universe does. It's 46 billion light

03:03.120 --> 03:08.320
years away in any direction. And the whole universe has a temporal edge, or what we call a beginning,

03:08.320 --> 03:13.280
but almost certainly not a spatial one. Does the universe have a center? Again, the observable

03:13.280 --> 03:19.440
universe does. You, the universe as a whole, almost certainly not. And is the universe getting bigger?

03:19.440 --> 03:24.560
Yes, space is expanding, which makes both the observable universe and the whole universe bigger.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.360
Plus, over time, we see older and older light coming from farther and farther away. So our

03:29.360 --> 03:34.560
observable universe gets bigger that way too. And that, in a nutshell, is our view from the tower.

03:34.880 --> 03:40.960
You are the center of the universe. And so am I. And so is everyone else. And so is no one.
