0	7840	The universe. How big is it? Does it have a center? Does it have an edge? Is it getting bigger? And if so, why?
7840	12960	Well, we know that there are two different meanings for universe. First, the observable universe is
12960	18320	everything that we've been able to see or observe thus far. And second, the universe, or the whole
18320	23600	universe, means everything that exists or has existed or will exist. More specifically, the
23600	28800	observable universe is the region of space visible to us from Earth. And since the universe is only
28800	34400	about 13.8 billion years old and light takes time to travel through space, then regardless of what
34400	39600	direction we look, we see light that's been traveling at most 13.8 billion years. So it's
39600	45680	logical to think that the observable universe must then be 2 times 13.77 equals 27.5 billion light
45680	51120	years across. But it's not. That's because over time, space has been expanding, so the distant
51120	57200	objects that gave off that light 13.8 billion years ago have since moved even farther away from us.
57200	61600	Today, those distant objects are a bit more than 46 billion light years away.
61600	67360	Multiply times 2 and you get 93 billion light years, the diameter of the observable universe.
67360	71680	To give you a sense of scale, the size of the Earth within the observable universe is roughly
71680	76000	equivalent to the size of a virus within the solar system. Although that doesn't help much
76000	80480	because we can't really appreciate the incomprehensible smallness of a virus nor the bewildering
80480	86240	bigness of our solar system either. So let's just say that the observable universe is stupendously big.
86240	92400	But the whole universe, as far as we can tell, is a lot bigger. Space is most likely infinite,
92400	96240	or at least it doesn't have an edge, though the difference between those is another story
96240	101840	unto itself. Now, what about the center of the universe? Well, the observable universe has a
101840	106880	center. Us, we are at the center of the observable universe because the observable universe is just
106880	112000	the region of space visible from Earth. And kind of like how the view from a very tall tower is a
112000	117360	circle centered on the tower, the piece of space we can see from here is naturally centered here.
117360	122000	In fact, if you want to be more precise, each one of us is the center of our own observable
122000	126000	universe. But that doesn't mean we're at the center of the whole universe, just like the tower
126000	130320	isn't the center of the world. It's the center of the piece of the world that it can see,
130320	134480	up to the horizon. But just because you can't see beyond the horizon doesn't mean there's
134480	139440	nothing there. And so it is with the observable universe. Looking up at the sky, we see light
139440	145120	that's at most 13.8 billion years old and coming from stuff that's now 46 billion light years away.
145120	150560	Anything farther is beyond the horizon. But each second, we see a new, even older light
150560	155440	coming from slightly farther away, three light seconds farther to be precise. And so our view
155440	160480	of the cosmos is literally getting bigger all the time. All we have to do is wait and watch as the
160480	166000	universe ages and light from more distant places has the time to get to us. So here we are, sitting
166000	171760	at the center of our observable piece of the whole universe. How big is the universe? Well,
171760	177520	the observable universe is currently 93 billion light years across. The whole universe is probably
177520	183120	infinite. Does the universe have an edge? The observable universe does. It's 46 billion light
183120	188320	years away in any direction. And the whole universe has a temporal edge, or what we call a beginning,
188320	193280	but almost certainly not a spatial one. Does the universe have a center? Again, the observable
193280	199440	universe does. You, the universe as a whole, almost certainly not. And is the universe getting bigger?
199440	204560	Yes, space is expanding, which makes both the observable universe and the whole universe bigger.
204560	209360	Plus, over time, we see older and older light coming from farther and farther away. So our
209360	214560	observable universe gets bigger that way too. And that, in a nutshell, is our view from the tower.
214880	220960	You are the center of the universe. And so am I. And so is everyone else. And so is no one.
