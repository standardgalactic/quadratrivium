00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Welcome to the Future of Life Institute podcast. My name is

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,400
Gus Docker and I'm here with Johannes Aquar. Johannes is a

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,640
researcher at Founders Pledge where he leads the Climate

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,600
Change Fund. Johannes, welcome to the podcast.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,280
Thanks so much for having me, Gus. Great to be here. I'm a big

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,520
fan of the Future of Life Institute. And yeah, happy to

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,040
talk all things climate today.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,960
Perhaps we could start with your role at Founders Pledge. What

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,480
is it that you do there? How do you how do you see your role?

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,160
Yeah, so I think the way I usually describe it is like my

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,440
goal and the goal of my team is kind of to like find and fund

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,280
kind of the highest impact opportunities and climate and

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,760
those are like philanthropic opportunities, right? So like

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,960
things where we can wear a million dollars or something in

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,920
the quarter of magnitude can kind of make a difference by

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,920
supporting initiatives that are like extremely promising. And

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,720
yeah, as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning, right? So

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,440
there's kind of the climate fund, which kind of puts this

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,560
to life, the Founders Pledge Climate Fund, but also we're

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,880
advising kind of, I know for individuals kind of beyond that

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,120
and kind of trying to, yeah, trying to identify using

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,840
research and using privatization research, kind of to

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,320
identify where where are the biggest blind spot, what are the

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,600
blind spot generating mechanisms, if you will, and kind of

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
what does that mean for what you should fund on a margin as an

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
ex philanthropist?

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,920
Yeah, and I think that word is the key. So thinking on the

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,640
margin here, I see your job, or I think that that your job is

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,880
about thinking about the marginal dollar, where is that

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,640
dollar best spent? Would that be the correct frame?

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,880
Yes, the next dollar or the next million dollar. And I think

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,440
that's like really, really crucial frame, because I think a

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,760
lot of the things that I am going to be saying is going to be

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,920
like, controversial, and might be wrong. If like, if one would

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
interpret them as unlike, this is all we should be doing. And

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,120
that's, I'm not really talking about this is all we should be

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,520
doing. I'm talking about like, at the margin, this is what we

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,760
should be doing relatively, relatively more off. Yeah, we're

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,280
going to get into a broad overview of the whole climate

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
change issue. We're going to look at all the potential

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,720
technologies or government options that might help us

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,000
alleviate this problem. But I think we should start with your

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,800
personal journey as an environmentalist. So how did

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,360
you end up in this role? Where did you start? When did you

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
first become interested in the climate?

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,080
So, I mean, I grew up in the 90s in Germany, so it was very

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,040
easy to kind of become an environmentalist, I think. So

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,720
kind of in my, I remember, like some of my first childhood

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,040
memories kind of being very interested in saving the tigers

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,040
as like inventing a board game, save the Siberian tiger kind of

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,680
like, like, yeah, there was a, an animal documentary on like

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,560
three times a week and like the last five or 10 minutes of the

53
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,880
documentary would always be like, okay, and now humans are

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,840
destroying this beautiful nature, right? So that that was kind

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,280
of, I think, very big part of kind of, yeah, of this, of this,

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,480
I think, initial, initial education, or becoming an

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,160
environmentalist. And I guess I got more serious about this kind

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,760
of, yeah, in my, in my teenage years, when I was like an

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,120
environmental activist for the German chapter of Friends of

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,840
the Earth, and kind of like, protesting President Bush to

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,360
sign the Kyoto Protocol when he was visiting this kind of

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,200
stuff. So that's kind of where it started. And then I kind of

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,160
when I came to to university, I think the idea for me was, okay,

64
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,760
let's kind of study social sciences with a focus on like

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,720
understanding what's kind of what kind of makes climate

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,680
policies successful. So that's kind of what I spent kind of my

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,440
studies on. And then I was working afterwards, for, for a

68
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
think tank in Germany for five years, kind of working on

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,160
carbon pricing. And that's kind of, ultimately, after this kind

70
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,480
of joint joint foundry pledge kind of went into philanthropy.

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,400
So that's kind of the story.

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,640
Yeah. And what's something you've changed your mind about? Where

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,400
where have you gotten new ideas or learned new facts that kind

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
of changed your priorities?

75
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,840
I mean, lots, lots and lots over the years, right? So that was

76
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,440
kind of like a very short introduction to like a 20 year

77
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,200
journey. I think the first big change probably in college kind

78
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,080
of. So at that point, I was kind of, yeah, very strongly kind

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,480
of, yeah, as I said, like influenced by the environmental

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,720
movement kind of was kind of card carrying environmentalist,

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,440
if you will. And essentially, at that point, kind of, yeah, as I

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,600
said, I was kind of studying social science or kind of

83
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,440
focusing on political culture and understanding in a way that

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,760
like the things that I believed or the kind of people like me

85
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,120
would believe about how to solve the climate change, right? So

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
like, heavily focused on renewables, heavily focused on

87
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,120
energy efficiency, heavily focused on lifestyle change, being

88
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,960
anti nuclear being somewhat skeptical of technological

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,320
innovation, right? That essentially, all of those

90
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,240
beliefs kind of fit together kind of in a very systematic

91
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,920
fashion, right? And what unites them is not that they're kind

92
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,520
of an adequate response to the climate challenge, what unites

93
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,880
them is that they're kind of part of a specific ideology and this

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,280
kind of this case kind of like a kind of egalitarian green

95
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
ideology, which kind of is framing a large part of the

96
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,520
climate conversation. So I think that was kind of the first

97
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,600
really important realization that like all of all of the

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,360
responses to the climate and to other problems are kind of

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,080
heavily ideological shaped, right? And like, if you have a

100
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,380
situation like every other climate, which is kind of

101
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,440
dominated by one kind of ideology, this will kind of shape

102
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,840
the shape the results. So so I think that was kind of one, I

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,840
think another one a bit later, when I was studying in the in the

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,920
United States, this was like 2012, 2011, 2012. This was the

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,480
time where essentially in the US kind of the big push, the

106
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,800
big push under Obama to kind of push for climate policy. Waxman

107
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,840
Markey was the name. So that kind of a cap and trade bill in the

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,240
United States kind of had just failed, right? And this was like

109
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,040
a once in a generation moment with regards to climate policy in

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,000
the US, right? So like the Democrats had like won the

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,760
presidency had like a huge majority in the House and the

112
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,200
Senate as well, right? So like, was kind of a situation of

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,400
reckoning, like, what are we going to do now? Because like,

114
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
even even under such favorable conditions that we kind of can

115
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,000
expect every like 15 or 20 years, like, we're not able to pass

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
climate policy in the US. So I think in that time, kind of

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,120
discovered kind of I think what I would describe is kind of like

118
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,800
the innovation hawk argument in climate, right? So like people

119
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,480
that are like very heavily focused on innovation, which I

120
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,200
think at that time was kind of not that big a part of the of

121
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,640
the climate coalitions. I think that's kind of another thing

122
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,600
that changed around that time. And I don't think I go all the

123
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,720
way but it's kind of interesting. So because in a way, what they

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,560
did or what they were emphasizing kind of became a big part of

125
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,840
climate policy that later passed. So like that has just passed

126
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,280
with President Biden is kind of essentially putting this lots of

127
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,320
those ideas into practice. But so that's another one. And then I

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,760
think another kind of big one, of course, for me growing up as a

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,720
German environmentalist, I was heavily anti nuclear. And being

130
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,920
in the US also is the first time kind of exposed to pro nuclear

131
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,280
environmentalists. And for a time was kind of lukewarm about

132
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,000
nuclear and at some point kind of realized, okay, even though it's

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,480
very uncomfortable in the German context, because otherwise

134
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,480
reasonable people become like very unreasonable and very

135
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,520
emotionally aggressive, like, when you're talking about nuclear

136
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,760
and when they became pro nuclear, but that was kind of an

137
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,480
important shift of mind as well. I think those are kind of three.

138
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,280
And then two more recent ones, I would say, 2015, essentially a

139
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,600
success of the Paris Agreement. So up until 2015, I think

140
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,280
international climate policy by and large had always failed. And

141
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,520
this was kind of like, the expectations were very low. And

142
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,960
then the fact that the Paris Agreement kind of succeeded,

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,280
even though it's kind of a non binding agreement, but it can

144
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,840
has completely changed the conversations that we're having

145
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,680
in different countries. So it kind of serves as this kind of

146
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,840
North Star that kind of lots of national conversations that

147
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,920
kind of focused on. So I think that's kind of was another

148
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,600
surprise.

149
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,280
In what sense did the Paris Agreement succeed? What would

150
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
have been the results of it?

151
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,240
I mean, the Paris Agreement has succeeded. I mean, not only the

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,840
Paris Agreement, but like around that time. So like that was

153
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,920
in late 2015, and then like 2016, 2017, the nature of the

154
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,560
climate conversation has completely changed, right? Like

155
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,960
around that time in Western countries anyway, in the sense

156
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,200
that like before it was kind of a relatively niche issue, and

157
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,280
it kind of became like a broad societal consensus that like

158
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,560
meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement matters. I mean, it's

159
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,480
maybe not political consensus across the political aisle in

160
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,760
all countries, but at least kind of for the left, the central

161
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,160
left kind of in all countries. So I think that kind of really

162
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,560
changed and kind of the idea of net zero and that climate was

163
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,240
kind of a top issue. Yeah, so I think that's kind of I think

164
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,160
what the Paris Agreement achieved, right? And like, this is

165
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,520
kind of very significant, like compare it, right? It's like

166
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,920
it's a non-binding treaty, ultimately. So there is a

167
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,200
version, I think you could have had a cynical take on this

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,000
agreement kind of before, like it's not and I certainly had

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,360
this to a degree, like it's not going to do much because it's

170
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,760
like a non binding, very weak agreement on some level, that's

171
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,320
true. So that's not what it's doing, what it's doing, it's

172
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
kind of like transforming, conforming the conversation.

173
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,680
And you mentioned a last thing that you changed your mind on?

174
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,320
I think a last thing that I would mention is kind of that. I

175
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,120
think that's kind of maybe like 2020 or so. Essentially, that

176
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,720
the situation around climate has improved very, very

177
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,720
significantly, which is kind of funny to say this, because I

178
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,160
think most people have the have the opposite perception. But

179
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,640
like, in general, that like so like in 2015, 2016, people were

180
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,240
saying things like, there's a 5% probability of some of more of

181
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,800
six degrees, or more warming. And I think right now, if you

182
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,080
would make this forecast, the forecast right now would be

183
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,040
something like maybe like half a percent that we get to six

184
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,400
degrees at all, and not more than six degrees, like an order of

185
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,240
magnitude change. And so essentially, that the forecast

186
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,520
before we're probably with pessimistic, but also that the

187
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,800
situation kind of has has changed very significantly, mostly

188
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,200
through the success of renewables, the success of kind of

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,480
electric cars that essentially the the very high risk climate

190
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,640
futures are essentially almost ruled out at this point. And

191
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
that's a very significant change.

192
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm wondering, when you're working with climate change,

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,880
this is such a complex issue. It's it's a it involves a lot of

194
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,600
disciplines, not just climate science itself, but economics

195
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,440
and law and the physics and engineering and all of these

196
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,440
disciplines, how do you form an all things considered view of

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,840
the situation in light of all of these disciplines? I mean, you

198
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,040
can't go get a PhD in all of them, I'm guessing. And so how do

199
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,920
you yeah, how do you how do you approach this?

200
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,440
I mean, in theory, you could but by the time you have those

201
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,640
PhDs, the problem was solved. Yeah, so I think the answer here,

202
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,080
I mean, has to be to kind of, essentially, you're always in

203
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,840
the state of like kind of being a reviewer and kind of like a

204
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,560
reviewer of different pieces of evidence. So that's like one

205
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,400
piece of the answer. Another piece of the answer is kind of

206
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,240
obviously, you do this on a team, right? So like, essentially,

207
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,720
right now, in my team, well, like we have a specialist kind of

208
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,160
for the technical economics, we have a specialist for Carmlock

209
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,440
and emerging economies, we have a specialist for philanthropy and

210
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,720
have other philanthropists behave. So that's kind of another

211
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,080
piece of the answer. But to, I think to answer it more

212
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,520
substantively, I think there's kind of like, three kinds of

213
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,880
expertise that are like most significant, when it comes to the

214
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,800
question of like, that I'm trying to answer, which is like,

215
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,160
what should we be doing philanthropically, right? So which

216
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
is kind of like only one way to answer the question of there,

217
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,880
I think it's kind of like one is kind of really the social

218
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,280
science question of like political visibility, like, which

219
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,520
kind of like carbon taxes, can we get where which kind of

220
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,640
policies can we achieve in a given country? So that's kind of

221
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,760
like, what does the option space actually look like? So that's

222
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,760
kind of, I think, one key expertise. The other one is kind

223
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
of like, what do different policies or different kind of

224
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
things in the world, what do they achieve, right? So like,

225
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,280
that's, I guess, policy analysis on econometrics and stuff like

226
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,160
that. And then there's kind of because climate change is really

227
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,080
a decadal challenge and the global challenge and like, it's

228
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,480
also a challenge of like, global technological transformation.

229
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,080
So then there's kind of this question of like, what do changes

230
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,120
and countries kind of what are the long term consequences of

231
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,720
that and kind of changing the technology stack, if you will,

232
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,040
globally, so it's a techno economic question. And I think

233
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,160
those three expertise was I kind of the most, most relevant

234
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,320
ones, from a, from a solution oriented perspective. And then

235
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,400
of course, if you're a philanthropist like myself,

236
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,480
then also like, what are other philanthropists doing, right?

237
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,880
Because like, doing the best thing on the margin is almost

238
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
always about kind of finding blind spots and filling the

239
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,560
blind spots.

240
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,960
Okay, so let's get to this broad overview that I would like of

241
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,000
climate change on the broadest possible scale. What is it that's

242
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,160
driving climate change? Is it mostly emissions? And if so,

243
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
where are these emissions coming from?

244
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,720
So it's like mostly mostly emissions, right? And so like all

245
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,960
of the mean all of climate change is about emissions. And so if

246
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,000
you kind of I mean, there's sort of different ways to slice it

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,320
by I guess, let's first kind of slice it by sector. So if you

248
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,160
kind of look at it by sector, then there's like 75% of

249
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,880
emissions are related to kind of energy and energy here like one

250
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,680
very important thing about climate electricity is only a small

251
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,160
part of energy electricity is about a third of energy. So like

252
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,080
when I say 75%, that's not only electricity, right? That's also

253
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,400
kind of transport fuels that's heating fuels and that's also

254
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,040
stuff like industrial heat. Essentially, the burning of

255
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,520
fossil fuels to produce energy. So that's about 75% of emissions.

256
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,560
Then there's about 5% of emissions that's kind of emissions

257
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,360
from industrial processes. So stuff like producing cement or

258
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,840
chemicals where you kind of have emissions that are not related

259
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,640
to fossil fuels that are called process emissions, right? And it

260
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,920
doesn't mean that industry is only 5%. This is about the kind of

261
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,880
the non energy share of industry. So that together gets you to

262
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,800
like about 80%. And then there's about 15 or like 18%. That's

263
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,320
kind of related to agricultural emissions, broadly. And then the

264
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,520
last 5% or so is kind of a combination of on the one hand,

265
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,640
stuff like deforestation, and then the other hand, stuff like

266
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,320
waste. So yeah, I think 80% of the challenge is kind of energy

267
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,760
energy industry. There's two important qualifications to

268
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,000
this. This is kind of where the emissions are coming from right

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,480
now, right? And like, that doesn't mean that this is exactly

270
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,320
proportional to what the solution looks like. So like, it can

271
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,120
definitely be the case of kind of land use change and kind of

272
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,080
like restoring wilderness, etc. It's like a bigger part of the

273
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,320
of the solution pipes. I think that's kind of one qualification.

274
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,960
And another qualification is that these percentages are kind

275
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,520
of heavily dependent on what warming metrics you use. So the

276
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,240
numbers that I cited right now are kind of for what's called

277
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,920
global warming potential 100. So like, if we're kind of assuming

278
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,400
over the course of 100 years, if you kind of take a shorter view,

279
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,200
if you would say something like global warming potential for the

280
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,560
next 20 years, then something like agriculture would have like a

281
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,440
larger share because methane, which is a very potent greenhouse

282
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,920
gas in the short term has kind of a relatively larger share in

283
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,960
agriculture than in other sectors. So that's another

284
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,640
important qualification here.

285
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,400
Yeah. And in global terms, our emissions still increasing?

286
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,200
Yes.

287
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,600
And how long do we expect them to increase?

288
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
Well, I mean, people have been talking about the end to

289
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,080
emission increase for a long time. And then there's always

290
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,640
something, something else coming up. So I think we will

291
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,280
probably see the end to increasing emissions this

292
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,760
decade. So I mean, it's mostly dependent on what China and India

293
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,960
are doing at this point. And they're both kind of, yeah, have

294
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,400
to go to kind of peak their emissions rather soon. So it could

295
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,280
happen, could happen this decade.

296
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,520
Yeah, you mentioned China and India, we should talk about

297
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,360
geographically where emissions are coming from, where, where have

298
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
they come from in the past and where are they likely to come

299
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,280
from in the future?

300
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,440
Well, so I think in the past, right, if you kind of take the long

301
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,440
view, then, and that's like, most of the emissions are certainly

302
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,600
like have been caused by, by Western countries, I think

303
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,440
that's, that's kind of clear. And like, we do have being in

304
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,000
Western countries, like a large historical responsibility. But

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
if we kind of look at the situation right now, like the US

306
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
right now, something like 15% of emissions, the EU is something

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,440
around like 10%. And like Asia is kind of something like close

308
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,800
to two thirds of emissions and then kind of the rest. And if we

309
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,520
kind of think this picture going forward, right, so like the

310
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,280
share of the EU and the share of the US is going to kind of

311
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,600
further decrease, I mean, probably to something like for the

312
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,200
US to something like 5% for like the EU, maybe something like

313
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,080
3%. And then, yeah, China is going to be something like 25% I

314
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
think over over the course of the century, then other other

315
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,800
emerging Asia kind of India and then Southeast Asia. And then

316
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,120
kind of at some point later in the century, Africa, hopefully

317
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,760
will, hopefully will grow strongly and like, I mean, yeah,

318
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,840
let's hope it's going to be low carbon. But like, I guess

319
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,320
there's kind of this kind of also part of the long game. So

320
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,480
like the emissions are very clearly the focus of emissions

321
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,520
is very much changing, right? That's kind of what I sometimes

322
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,960
call like the central conundrum of climate policy, which is like

323
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,440
the people that are responsible for a lot of the historical

324
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,040
emissions kind of have very little direct leverage and kind of

325
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,280
how the problem is going to become because kind of

326
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,360
essentially, in the EU, like there's not a lot of emissions

327
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
you can reduce like I mean, anymore, right? Like I mean,

328
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,040
already kind of reaching the goal of getting to carbon

329
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,120
neutrality by 2050 is like very ambitious. But at that point,

330
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,880
like there's there's no leverage left.

331
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,320
Because you project that EU is only going to be 3% of emissions.

332
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,040
And so reducing emissions by 3% would be great, but it's not

333
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,440
going to tackle the problem in a big way.

334
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,040
Essentially, most of the leverage that the EU has on

335
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,080
emissions does not come from the own territorial emissions,

336
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,600
right? So if we kind of look at the most significant things

337
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,800
that EU countries have done, it's like things like Denmark

338
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,920
making wind energy cheap, Germany kind of making solar

339
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,920
cheap. These these kind of things have like done way way more

340
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,160
to like transform the energy future than like emission

341
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,120
changes within Europe.

342
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,360
European countries have subsidized technologies that can

343
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,440
then be exported to other countries where they can decrease

344
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,800
emissions much more than they could in those European countries

345
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
themselves. From what you're saying that the biggest problem

346
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,920
or the biggest driver of emissions is energy production. I

347
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,640
wonder if that category is too broad. I mean, a lot of things

348
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,560
must must be covered by energy production. Is it? What what

349
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,800
does that category cover?

350
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,360
Yeah, so like I think, yeah, I mean, it covers kind of

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,920
electricity, it covers heating, it covers transport, and it

352
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,360
also covers, I mean, that's also heating, but it's kind of

353
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,440
very different than what we mean when we say heating like

354
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,600
stuff like industrial heat, right, which like steel and stuff

355
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,680
like that. And like on some level, it's kind of true broader

356
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,080
term. I still find it useful to think about as kind of one

357
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,800
piece, because especially if we're thinking about the kind of

358
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,200
the solution trajectory, right? So like, what like, I guess the

359
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,280
master plan plan and so far as there is a master plan to kind

360
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,240
of solve climate, right? As essentially electrify everything

361
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,760
or like mean electrify all energy consumption, right? So that

362
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,000
sounds like, historically, those sectors have been very

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,880
different, but like, or kind of also very different in terms of

364
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,760
the fuels, but like, you want to get in a situation where like,

365
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,560
the central problem is one of kind of on the one hand getting

366
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,360
electricity or energy production kind of low or zero carbon. And

367
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,640
on the other hand, kind of either directly right with

368
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,880
electric cars or indirectly through stuff like hydrogen,

369
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,600
electrifying kind of a lot of other stuff. So in that sense,

370
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,920
it's a cross simplification to speak of like energy as one

371
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,640
sector, but it's also, I think, if we're kind of at the broad

372
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,560
level, it's a useful one in terms of, yeah, in terms of the

373
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,360
solution landscape.

374
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,440
Yeah, so so the categories is kind of unified by the same

375
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,720
solution, the same solution would solve all of the the the

376
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,400
things that belong to that category. So electrification

377
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,040
would be a solution for many of the things that belong to that

378
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,680
category. Or is that too strong?

379
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,080
I mean, it's just a little bit too strong. But I think it's

380
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,120
kind of right in the, yeah, basically right, I would say,

381
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,800
right. So, so how far electrification goes kind of

382
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,840
depends on like, like things are differentially easy to

383
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
electrify. So like, things that are hard to electrify stuff that

384
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,040
kind of requires, I mean, either a long duration of storage or

385
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,160
like lots of kind of concentrated energy, or so like

386
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,520
stuff like heavy duty transport, right, like electrifying

387
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,840
trucks is much harder than electrifying passenger cars. And

388
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,560
like, like refining large or like decarbonizing large ships,

389
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
it's kind of much harder and airplanes much harder than

390
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,040
cars. So, and for some of those, you might either use kind of

391
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,680
indirect electrification, right? So kind of like hydrogen or

392
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,800
like using power to create hydrogen. But it might also go

393
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,400
another way, you can also kind of create hydrogen kind of with

394
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,280
natural gas and carbon capture and storage. Yeah, so that's kind

395
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,960
of where there is more, more nuance there, where we can kind

396
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,240
of dive deeper.

397
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,720
Why is it more difficult to electrify an airplane than a car?

398
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,840
Is it is it because the airplane will have will have a need for

399
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
higher peak energy output or something like that?

400
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,720
Well, it's essentially, I mean, batteries are very heavy. And so

401
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,440
like an airplane becomes much more efficient, because once you

402
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,760
burn the fuel, it's kind of not, it has no weight anymore. And

403
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,400
it's also so like that's kind of one part. And like the other

404
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,400
part is kind of like energy, energy density, right? So like,

405
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,920
in principle, like flying and air, like flying kind of requires

406
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,080
a lot of, like, it's kind of much harder than kind of moving

407
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,360
moving a car around. And so you kind of need, need higher energy

408
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,880
density.

409
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,040
Okay, so what I want to do is to walk through all of the

410
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,960
potential technological options we have. Start with that. I'm

411
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,800
going to start with talking about oil and coal, which is kind

412
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,760
of a funny place to start maybe, because in some sense, oil and

413
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
coal is is the whole reason for the problem. But I think it's

414
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,440
interesting to discuss oil and coal just because if we know

415
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,160
something about why they are hard to replace, we might know

416
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,240
something about how to how to best go about the climate change

417
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,360
problem. So yeah, I've written down that that oil and coal is

418
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,040
cheap, and it works in existing systems. Do you see other

419
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
advantages beyond those I just mentioned?

420
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,800
Yeah, I think those are kind of the the two really big ones,

421
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,520
right? And like work in existing systems, I think another way to

422
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,640
put this is like, we've essentially built an entire world

423
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,480
economy around them. So they fit with existing systems, because

424
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,840
we built an entire economy around them and not only in the

425
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,640
economy, right? Like the United States is kind of having

426
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,120
aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, because kind of

427
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,080
protecting oil reserves is kind of part of the, well, it's like

428
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,400
part of the overall kind of strategy, right? So it's like,

429
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,280
yeah, essentially, we've been spending more than a century

430
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,480
optimizing our energy and world economy for relying on oil,

431
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,920
alcohol, natural gas, I think another kind of advantage that

432
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,280
they do have, I mean, at least if we compare them to renewables,

433
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,440
to most renewables is that they do have higher energy

434
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,520
densities. So yeah, and then of course, I mean, in the case of

435
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,200
oil, right, like oil is easy to transport, coal is also relatively

436
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,120
easy to transport with gas, it's a bit harder. Yeah, so I think

437
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,040
this is kind of like broadly speaking, that's that seems like

438
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
the right characterization.

439
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,080
And of course, the enormous disadvantage here is that there's

440
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,120
very high emissions associated with oil and coal. And I think

441
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,480
additionally, there are, there are quite large problems with

442
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,560
air pollution, which provides us with an additional reason to

443
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,480
replace oil and coal, maybe you could talk about air pollution

444
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,640
from from oil and coal. How big of a problem is that?

445
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,760
So air pollution at large kills about 7 million people every

446
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,920
year. So it's like one of the leading causes of death. And not

447
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,400
all of that is related to fossil fuels, right? So like, we also

448
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,960
have the situation that some of that is actually related to

449
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,560
renewables, like to, especially in Africa, people burning wood

450
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,800
for heating at home and for cooking. So that that's actually

451
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,080
a situation where like using a fossil fuel, in this case, natural

452
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,920
gas would actually be much better because it would. But

453
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,480
essentially, so, in particular, coal and oil, kind of, yeah,

454
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,360
yeah, kill kill a lot of people. So gas is a lot cleaner. So gas

455
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,920
is about 15 times cleaner than coal in terms of air pollution.

456
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,320
But it's a very significant cause of death. And I think it's

457
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,520
also really underappreciated. So like, people usually talk about

458
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,440
air pollution is kind of like a co benefit of climate change.

459
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,560
Unlike climate change has to get really bad to kill like 5

460
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,320
million people every year. Like, right? So like, it's kind of

461
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,200
quite possible that resolving climate change and like the most

462
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
significant effect of that is kind of a reduction in kind of

463
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,600
air pollution casualties, right? Obviously, like this is not the

464
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,800
highest risk case, right? Like there are cases with there's no

465
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,400
case with air pollution, like killing 100 million people, right?

466
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,320
And there's kind of cases, there's a risk cases around

467
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,840
climate that kind of motivate caring about climate that are

468
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,560
more extreme than killing 5 million people. But like, we would

469
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,560
yeah, it's just just I guess it's not it's not a co benefit.

470
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,320
It's kind of a problem on a similar order of magnitude.

471
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,480
Yeah, makes sense. Air pollution is a huge deal. Why is it that

472
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,720
oil and gas is hard to replace? And here we might talk about a

473
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,600
carbon lock in also, which is a term that that's used.

474
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,400
The primary reason that if like energy transitions are, well,

475
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,680
energy transitions are hard for a couple of reasons, right? But

476
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,240
like, okay, let's let's kind of start with that with a lock in

477
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,760
reason to begin with. A lot of the assets, right, like pipelines,

478
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,880
or coal power plants, or highways, etc. Right? Like those are

479
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,640
very long lived assets, right? They have natural lifetimes that

480
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,360
are like 40 or 60 years. They're capital intensive assets. So

481
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,880
like, even if like, you're kind of in a situation where like

482
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,280
every new build is kind of the low carbon alternative, it will

483
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,200
take you like 40 years to kind of turn around like an entire

484
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,520
system, right? And that's kind of an optimistic case. So like,

485
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,480
it's like, there's a lot of kind of lock in and then there's so

486
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,680
like, this is kind of at the pure kind of technical or

487
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,600
infrastructural level, right? And then you also have stuff like,

488
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,480
like pipelines and infrastructure, which are, which are

489
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,800
even, even longer, longer lived than single assets. And then of

490
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,120
course, you have like a huge kind of political economy, like

491
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,040
political special interest kind of groups and kind of the

492
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,920
entire kind of fate of countries essentially build around

493
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,480
that, right? I guess like when people say like, Putin used to

494
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,080
behave like the CEO of like a gas company, right? Like, I mean,

495
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,200
kind of changed a little bit the way he's behaving. But like,

496
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,480
right, like, it's kind of like, like their entire countries or

497
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,960
entire kind of regions of the world that are like heavily

498
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,040
dependent on the fossil fuel economy. So I think that's kind

499
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,360
of another really big reason. And another reason of like,

500
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,480
obviously, is also like energy transitions in general move

501
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,520
towards denser forms of energy, right? So like what we're trying

502
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,120
to do right now, where we're essentially saying, okay, we want

503
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,080
to move from a fossil fuel dominated energy economy to one

504
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,880
that's kind of dominated by renewables, kind of not a natural

505
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,840
direction for an energy transition to go. So like the more

506
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,080
natural direction of energy transitions thus far has been

507
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,880
like from less energy dense fuels of like from biomass to

508
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,680
fossil fuels, right? And like, going from fossil fuels to

509
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,800
mostly mostly renewable powered systems, actually, it's not a

510
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,520
natural move of the energy system, probably wouldn't happen.

511
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,120
Like there are many other situations where it kind of

512
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,080
wouldn't happen.

513
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,320
Yeah, maybe here is a natural point to talk about energy

514
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,440
density. Why is energy density important?

515
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,360
So energy density, right? So like, essentially how much land or

516
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,600
how many resources do you need to kind of produce a given amount

517
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,880
of energy? So the reason that's important, I think, is kind of

518
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,040
like, two fold mean from an environmental perspective, energy

519
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,040
density is essentially a proxy for like, how much impact we have

520
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,680
on the environment, right? So if you're using less land, using

521
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,280
less materials, then you're kind of like principle, like lower

522
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,360
energy density means like lower environmental impact. So that's

523
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,040
kind of one, one part of it. The other part, which is more about

524
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,160
like what's useful for for human civilization, right? So like

525
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,200
having denser forms of energy, like if you're talking about

526
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,160
electricity, it means like you need less transmission, for

527
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,280
example, right? So like that's kind of another use. And you're

528
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,680
also kind of, if you want to power, like an industrial center

529
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,640
or like an urbanizing society, like having lots of energy, and

530
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,640
having relatively dense forms of energy is useful. One shouldn't

531
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,440
overdo this, right? It's like, I'm not saying like, on the limit,

532
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,320
kind of, we would have like one big fusion plant and we all kind

533
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,760
of just get from. So that's clearly not the case. I think

534
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,840
we've seen this with nuclear fission that like, having very

535
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,040
large kind of energy sources also as a downside, because demand

536
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,840
isn't always there. So like, not take it to the extreme limit,

537
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,400
but like, kind of, on some level, like energy density and

538
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,520
principle is kind of useful, a useful metric.

539
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,360
But when you when you talk about energy density, it's you're

540
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,920
talking about also the resources necessary to produce that

541
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,280
energy, not only the energy density, say, for example, of a 10

542
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,800
centimeter by 10 centimeter cube of coal or oil or fuel for for a

543
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,040
nuclear reactor, it's a broader term than that. That's energy

544
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,880
density, where we have historically been moving towards

545
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,160
forms of energy that are that are more dense. And now we're

546
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,240
trying to move towards forms of energy that are that are less

547
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,240
dense. I think before we get to renewables, we should we should

548
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,040
talk about natural gas that you mentioned a couple of times. And

549
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,640
what are the advantages here and disadvantages? I'm guessing

550
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,320
it's it's better than oil and coal.

551
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,800
Just to add on the energy density, like because we've talked

552
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,560
about why it's important, but we didn't talk about what does it

553
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,840
actually look like. So like, if you're kind of if you look at

554
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,680
the metric site, nuclear nuclear power would be something like

555
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,560
seven terawatt hours per square kilometers, natural gas, which

556
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,600
we're going to talk about next, it's like about half that. And

557
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,880
like solar is kind of about 100 or so, roughly, what nuclear is

558
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,360
right. So that's kind of why it matters. Like the differences

559
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,040
are quite stark, both from from renewables to fossil fuels and

560
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,240
from fossil fuels to nuclear, like natural gas, if we talk about

561
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,560
natural gas. So I mean, it's about half as polluting as coal, in

562
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,840
terms of CO2. And it's much, much less polluting about 15

563
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,920
times less polluting when we talk about air pollution. And

564
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,480
essentially, if we look at the decarbonization successes of the

565
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,280
last 20 years, like many of them have been coal to gas

566
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,880
transitions. So like, essentially, the fact that the US was

567
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,680
kind of able to reduce emissions, even though until like 2021

568
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,280
didn't really have much in terms of climate policies, like,

569
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,400
mostly the story of the fracking revolution in the United

570
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,680
States, and kind of the replacement of coal by natural

571
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,200
gas, a little bit similar in the UK, in the UK, there's kind of

572
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,760
natural gas is also like more of a renewable expansion. And

573
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,280
that's so like, that's kind of another select that's kind of

574
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,920
this has been a big story. It's like an easy win, right? It's

575
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,120
not a transformational win because you don't get to zero

576
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,520
emissions. But it's kind of the easy win. So if you're imposing

577
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,520
moderate carbon price, in a place with a lot of coal, that

578
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,240
will usually mean you're gonna substitute it with natural gas.

579
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,400
In which cases does it make sense to switch to natural gas?

580
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,520
I mean, that's kind of like, right, that that's kind of I

581
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,640
think something where the climate community has like two

582
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,680
different perspectives, right? I think there are people that

583
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,920
are more incrementalists that would say like, yeah, it's good

584
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,920
if you're switching from coal to natural gas. There's also

585
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
people that would say, okay, if you're switching from coal to

586
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,720
natural gas, you're locking in another fossil fuel source, right?

587
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,040
And it's kind of like better to maybe have coal run a bit

588
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,520
longer and then fully replace it with a zero carbon source. I

589
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,320
think that's kind of the debate. And I think different people

590
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,640
have like different opinions. And I think also the right answer

591
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,560
might be different in different places. The best case scenario

592
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,680
would be one for like, natural gas replaced with coal. And then

593
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,160
natural gas is kind of replaced with natural gas and gas and

594
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,760
carbon capture. So where you're kind of capping the emissions

595
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,120
or where you're using kind of part of the natural gas

596
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,200
infrastructure with like zero carbon fuels, right? So like

597
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,920
with natural gas kind of that's produced for electrolysis and

598
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,960
kind of like additional like adding CO2 there or yeah, so

599
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,800
it's a synthetic natural gas, essentially.

600
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,600
So that last point, is there a way to produce that natural gas

601
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,320
that's more environmentally friendly?

602
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,000
So I mean, natural gas is CH4. So in principle, you can, you

603
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,440
can get it from H2 like from hydrogen, like which you can

604
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,080
generate in a low carbon way. And if you would kind of then

605
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,760
take CO2 out of the air, so you can essentially produce like

606
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,240
carbon neutral, natural gas, right? Like this. Yeah, or you

607
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,760
could use hydrogen. Yeah. So essentially, there's ideas of

608
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,080
about using some of the kind of natural gas infrastructure for

609
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,440
like zero carbon gases. And that's I think something like one

610
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,360
way where carbon lock in can be made a little bit less severe,

611
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,880
right? Where you're like locking in like a gas infrastructure,

612
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,080
for example, but that gas could at some point be carbon neutral.

613
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,640
Yeah, if we build a new natural gas plant now, how much carbon

614
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,880
are we locking in? For how many years would this natural gas

615
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
plant have to run in order to be profitable or to make sense to

616
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,320
build? If you're building new natural gas plants right now, I

617
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,680
think they expect like most like if you're in a Western

618
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,200
country, I don't think the investor would have the

619
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,880
expectation that they're going to run this for 40 years, because

620
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,480
like running this for 40 years would mean they're not 2023. So

621
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,640
like 13 years after kind of most Western countries have

622
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,120
committed to like reaching net zero. That being sad, right?

623
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,280
Like even countries like Germany, that are kind of

624
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,240
priding themselves to be climate leaders are building new

625
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,200
natural gas capacity right now in an energy crisis situation,

626
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,040
right? So we're essentially, I guess the way this becomes

627
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,280
profitable is because we really do value energy security. So

628
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,160
like, as countries, we're willing to kind of finance

629
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,120
things that don't make sense in a long run perspective, if you

630
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,400
will.

631
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,080
Maybe we could say a bit more about energy density and why

632
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,920
it's important. Is it important because some forms of energy

633
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,920
take up too much space and then crowd out other other things

634
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,240
we would like to do with that space like having natural

635
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,400
habitats or yet using the land for agriculture or what's the

636
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,640
problem with energy sources with low energy density?

637
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,720
So like crowding out of like other land uses is definitely a

638
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,320
factor, right? So especially for biofuels, I think it's a

639
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,080
factor with like biofuels take up a lot of land and like kind of

640
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,800
agricultural land that that can compete with like food

641
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,000
security concerns. Yes, I think that is kind of one concern. So

642
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
like land use, right? So like if I looked at a paper where

643
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
essentially that's kind of modeling a transition towards a

644
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,280
lower carbon future and what they're essentially like, and like

645
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,680
a renewable heavy future, what they're essentially modeling is

646
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:57,440
like, okay, by 2050, there is some six fold increase in the land

647
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,200
required required for energy production compared to today. And

648
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,520
like to be fair, like it's not that it's six times less

649
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,520
efficient, because also like electricity production is like

650
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,960
assumed to triple over the time frame rate. So that's kind of a

651
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,440
halving of like efficiency in terms of like energy density,

652
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,240
that's like a still a significant change. I think to me, the

653
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,200
more the more fundamental challenge is really one of like, if

654
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,440
you're having lots of decentralized energy sources,

655
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,120
like kind of the requirements in terms of transmission and like

656
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,640
infrastructure, build out are kind of like much, much larger,

657
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,640
right? So essentially, when we're saying it is cheap, and it is

658
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,320
easy to build renewables, we're talking about is kind of on the

659
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,680
plant level where this is true. But when we're talking about the

660
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,520
energy system level and say like we want to build an energy

661
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,320
system that is primarily based on low energy density sources,

662
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,360
like I'm not saying this cannot work, but like this is like a

663
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,560
risky proposition, mostly for the for transmission and storage

664
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,000
requirements that are kind of related to low energy density

665
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
and intermittency.

666
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,840
Okay, so that's oil, coal and natural gas. What about if we if

667
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,240
we get into the renewables, so solar and wind? What are some

668
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,320
advantages of solar and wind?

669
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,160
At this point, solar and wind are pretty cheap. So at this point,

670
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,880
I think in many, in many places in the world will be the case

671
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,080
that like adding solar capacity to the grid is like one of the

672
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,840
cheapest things you can do. It's very important to realize

673
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,800
that like this is not a fact of like nature or like technology

674
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,280
itself, that's a result of like very conscious social choices,

675
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,120
right? I mean, it's essentially countries like Germany and

676
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,240
jurisdictions like California, and then later kind of China,

677
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,240
essentially saying, okay, we really want to have cheap

678
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,840
renewables, and we're really like heavily investing that. So in

679
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,920
that sense, kind of the fact that we have cheap renewables

680
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,440
right now is much more a function of their popularity

681
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,640
with constituencies than it is kind of like the principle

682
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,160
underlying technology, right? So like, if like nuclear would be

683
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,120
as popular as like renewables are, we probably also could have

684
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,640
like cheap nuclear now, this is kind of what I'm saying, or a

685
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,920
geothermal for that matter. So I think that's kind of an

686
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,600
important aspect here. So yeah, there can be quite cheap. And

687
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,800
also there are use cases where decentralized and kind of

688
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,640
smaller production is kind of good, right? So I mean, you can

689
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,840
kind of use deploy them where they are needed, right? Like if

690
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,880
you're, if you're a small town, you're not going to build your

691
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,960
own kind of big power plant, but you can build your, but your

692
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,640
solar's on the rooftop, etc. So I think that's kind of the main

693
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,120
advantage obviously produces no carbon, no air pollution. Yeah,

694
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,160
and can be can be built quickly.

695
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,280
Yeah, so you mentioned that that solar and wind have gotten

696
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,120
cheaper because of basically policies by European countries

697
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,320
and by California and so on. When when solar has reached the

698
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,840
price point that it has that it that it's at now, does it

699
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,080
require kind of continual subsidies to stay at that price

700
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,640
point? Or have we developed solar to a point now that it's

701
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,560
price competitive, even on an open market, let's say. So in

702
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,360
energy, you generally don't have open markets. I think that's an

703
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,840
important thing to realize. So solar is competitive in many

704
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,120
cases, right? But like, it's not like with oil, we're like, you

705
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,720
have a global price of oil, right? It's like, essentially, for

706
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,600
solar, like how costs affect on the solar, compared to

707
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,720
alternatives depends on like, how good is the solar resource?

708
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,120
Depends also on like, how much solar is already on the grid?

709
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,880
Because like, you can be in a situation where like installing

710
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
the additional solar capacity is very cheap, but it's not going

711
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,560
to produce a lot of additional value because essentially, like

712
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,280
the sun is shining at the time where you're already at 100%

713
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,080
solar, then like, it's easy to add an additional solar power

714
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,200
plant, that's kind of it doesn't add a lot. Unless you kind of

715
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,400
have cheap storage or cheap transmission, super cheap, sorry,

716
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,600
super cheap transmission. So that's what's called value

717
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,000
deflation. So it's not really like, it doesn't really make

718
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,200
sense to think about it as like, one price point that that is

719
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,400
being, being undercut, right? So like, we're in a situation

720
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,920
where there are places in the world where like, adding solar

721
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,400
kind of happens without subsidies, and it's kind of like,

722
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,200
essentially, the natural result of like market forces or like

723
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,080
mediated market forces. And we have also places with quite a

724
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,200
very high renewable penetration, right, places like

725
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,600
California, or Germany, where like, places that made renewables

726
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,440
so cheap, but that are now kind of struggling to add a lot more

727
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,880
because stuff like system integration, or like the value

728
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,360
of an additional plant is kind of, is kind of low.

729
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,120
How much of our energy production could be replaced by wind and

730
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,880
solar alone? The problem with wind and solar, or one problem is

731
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,760
that it's intermittent. So it requires the sun to shine or the

732
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,080
wind to blow, unless you have a really good storage technology,

733
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,400
basically, batteries. But how much of our energy production do

734
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,800
you think we could replace by by solar and wind?

735
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,560
You don't only need batteries, right? So like, essentially, you

736
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,400
need to solve, I think, three or four problems. So like, one is

737
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,320
kind of short term storage. For this, you can use batteries.

738
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,520
And right, that's kind of like, okay, you can run your washing

739
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,720
machine during the night, that that's kind of the use case.

740
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,880
Then you kind of need to solve in most places in the world, you

741
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,520
need to solve seasonal storage, right, so that there's kind of

742
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,680
like parts of the year where like, there's much less solar

743
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,040
available. Like, that's like a much, much harder challenge. And

744
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
I think that's kind of underappreciated, because people

745
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,080
talk about storage, they think about batteries, and they think

746
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,800
the problem was solved. And like, kind of essentially, being

747
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,640
able to have enough energy to like half a month, or like more

748
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,240
kind of work of like energy reserve requires a very different

749
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,840
solution. It's not probably not going to happen with batteries,

750
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,640
that's kind of for something like, right, what I've talked about

751
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,960
before, like, power to x, like producing hydrogen or kind of

752
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,360
other forms of like, low carbon energy, like gases or like

753
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,680
liquid to store energy. So like, that's kind of what you will

754
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,760
need there. And then there's kind of the problem of

755
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,880
transmission. And then there's a problem around essentially, do

756
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,600
we have enough land in the jurisdictions? I think the last

757
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,040
one will not be the decisive constraint, I think that that

758
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,280
will will probably work. But essentially, there's like, three,

759
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,480
three challenges, like storage in the short term, seasonal

760
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,120
storage, transmission, I can't imagine the world, right, if

761
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,000
when I think about the future, I always try to think of a

762
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,840
distribution. And like, there's like part of that

763
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,800
distribution where like, okay, wind and solar are kind of

764
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,160
really like 80 or 90% of the energy supply. And essentially,

765
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,040
seasonal storage has been solved, transmission has been

766
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,360
solved, and it's kind of that that's a large part of the

767
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,920
solution. Those are not the futures I'm particularly worried

768
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,680
about. Because I mean, those are really very best case futures,

769
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,120
it's like an AI safety of like AGI is inherently safe, that's

770
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,000
kind of the future. And then there are kind of the futures

771
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,280
where like, something has gone wrong, right? And like, that's

772
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,960
kind of like an hour climate response and like a natural thing

773
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,080
or things like one of the most likely failure modes right now

774
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,600
that we can like, if we kind of if we're kind of waking up in

775
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,880
2040, and like, we're on a trajectory to like, more than

776
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,920
three degrees, it's very likely that kind of, we've been

777
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,120
overbeating on intermittent renewables, that essentially,

778
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,320
that it is much harder, even though it's easy to get to like

779
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,880
20, 30% in electricity, like getting to like 100% in energy

780
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,600
right again, like, and then like, growing demand, like

781
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,720
something like 10x compared now that this is kind of really

782
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,240
hard. So this is an area where there's very significant

783
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,360
uncertainty, I would say we're kind of, yeah, on the top, you

784
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,520
can kind of do almost get almost 100%, but also where it's kind

785
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,400
of quite imaginable that you don't get over, over 50% of

786
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,600
energy, which will still be like a huge, huge role, right? I

787
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,760
mean, right now, it's kind of something like three to 4% of

788
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,160
like energy. You mentioned the seasonal storage, what are the

789
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,360
most promising approaches there? This is something where it's

790
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,680
not primarily about batteries, right? So it's primarily about

791
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,760
kind of using more energy dense form. So like, for example,

792
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,080
using using kind of excess capacity, excess power

793
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,680
capacity, to produce carbon neutral hydrogen and to store

794
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,120
this as hydrogen or to kind of store this like synthetic

795
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,480
natural gas. This to me seems right now, the most plausible

796
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,840
trajectory. I mean, there's also kind of like, there's, there's

797
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,520
lots of different technologies that are being tried out.

798
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,400
Okay, so that's, that's solar and wind, which could turn out

799
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,200
very, very well. But where there are challenges to be solved

800
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,160
before they can be implemented and can constitute a large

801
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,120
percentage of our energy production.

802
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,480
That sounds too pessimistic. It's more like, solar and wind

803
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,160
will definitely play a much larger role than they're playing

804
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,680
now. The question is, will they take us to 100% but like, yeah,

805
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,840
that's a different, yeah, it's a different framing, right? So

806
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,840
like, yeah, the short term story is definitely about the

807
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,120
expansion of, of mature renewables.

808
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,640
We should say something about the, to my eyes, insane decrease

809
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,960
in the price of solar, or at least it looks like a very,

810
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,480
very steep decrease when I look at these graphs. Yeah, can you

811
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,840
say something about how much cheaper solar is now compared to

812
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,720
20 years ago?

813
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,960
Well, it's essentially at like less than 10% of where it was

814
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,080
20 years ago, right? So like, that's, that isn't an insane

815
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,880
decrease. So I like, I remember when I was kind of entering the

816
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,200
climate conversation, and people were talking about renewables,

817
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,040
they were always talking about solar wind, geothermal, hydro,

818
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,080
bio, at some point, people only started talking about solar and

819
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,680
wind, right? Because essentially, those technologies

820
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,440
could like radically cheaper, in particular, solar wind also,

821
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,000
but a bit less so. Yeah, so that's a very, very steep decline,

822
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,800
right, which has been achieved. There's a great book about this

823
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,240
how solar got cheap by Gregory Named, but essentially, it's

824
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,360
kind of primarily a result kind of very aggressive policy. I

825
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,920
mean, it kind of goes back to the 1970s and like, the first

826
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,280
oil crises from like Jimmy Carter, but then kind of got really

827
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,160
picked up in the early 2000s, right, of like Germany, kind of

828
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,720
really strongly supporting it, also like not only Germany, also

829
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,280
like California, etc. And then like, at some point, China

830
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,360
essentially massively investing in production capacity. So yeah,

831
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,920
and that's kind of a big part of the story as well. It's not a

832
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,720
story of fundamental technological innovation. It's

833
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,560
really more of a brute force approach to making things cheap.

834
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,360
What about Hydro? Could Hydro ever constitute a large percent

835
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,000
of our energy production?

836
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,200
So Hydro could, I think, I mean, it's like, it's already, I

837
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,560
think it's still, if I'm not mistaken, it's still like the

838
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,240
largest renewable energy resource, right? It's kind of, it's

839
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,240
not really talked about because it's kind of like, static, it's

840
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,040
not like the, it's not sexy, it's not where the action is. But

841
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,680
like, it's a very significant part. I think like with Hydro,

842
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,720
like large Hydro has like large kind of environmental

843
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,960
downsides. And I think another kind of constrained, like, so

844
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,920
that's a couple of other constraints. And one is like

845
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,400
geopolitical. If you're kind of talking about them, hydropower

846
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,040
is often like a very kind of contentious issue if you're

847
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,000
thinking about denial or other other areas. So like, that's

848
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:27,080
another big problem. And it's also like very long term

849
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,600
infrastructure. So I think like, Hydro, I think, like from a

850
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,240
technical perspective, like Hydro could play a larger role,

851
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,080
but it's kind of, I don't think there are many people that are

852
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,720
kind of betting on like an abundant future with lots of

853
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,560
Hydro. Or at least I haven't come across them. I think I know

854
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,800
exactly like one charity that's working on hydropower. That's

855
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,800
mostly on making less clear paths. And the answer, they're

856
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,360
kind of trying mostly to use hydropower, making existing

857
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,160
hydropower or existing dams more efficient, like essentially

858
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,840
using them more to produce electricity.

859
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,200
Do we even have enough large rivers to, to generate enough

860
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,680
electricity by Hydro?

861
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,440
That's a good question. But I actually don't know the answer

862
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,360
because it's kind of so far out of the overturned window. One

863
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,520
other thing I want to say on Hydros that essentially Hydro is

864
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,240
affected by climate change as well, right? So like, essentially

865
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,240
that Hydro is becoming a less reliable energy resource,

866
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,960
essentially, as kind of climate patterns, precipitation

867
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,120
patterns become harder to predict and more extreme. So I

868
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,920
think it's kind of another reason why it's not like, it's not a

869
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,000
major bet that anyone I think is kind of really making at this

870
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,560
point. Okay, let's move on to nuclear energy. What do you see

871
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,320
as the advantages and disadvantages there?

872
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,040
Hey, like the biggest advantage is like related to energy

873
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,520
density, right? I mean, it sounds like ironic and very

874
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,920
counterintuitive to say this, but like from an environmental

875
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,720
perspective, like nuclear is kind of the cleanest, cleanest

876
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,040
form of energy production. Because it's like of those that we

877
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,000
have right now, because it's so, so energy dense, it doesn't need

878
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,320
a lot of materials, it doesn't need a lot of land. Yeah, so

879
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,120
I think that's kind of the clear advantage produces zero

880
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,920
carbon disadvantages, I think are are well known in the case of

881
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,880
nuclear. So accident risk, nuclear waste. Yeah, and also I

882
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,760
guess some dual use concerns around like nuclear weapons. Yes,

883
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,360
I think those are kind of the disadvantages and also right

884
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,200
now, but that's not a fundamental feature of

885
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,600
technology. That's kind of something of, I guess it's a

886
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,040
result of social choice. Right now, it's very expensive and

887
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,760
slow to build. Yeah, that was actually my my next question

888
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,800
would be, when I look at some new nuclear power plant, it has

889
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,800
often taken a decade or more to build. And it's gone over

890
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,800
budget. So so why is it so? Why does it take so long? And why

891
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,680
does it cost so much to build nuclear power plants?

892
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,000
Like I think right now, I mean, we were able to build nuclear

893
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,240
power plants in France and something like four years,

894
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,160
right? And right now, we're not able to do this in the West

895
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,440
right now, it would probably more take something like 20 years.

896
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,920
But so there's a lot of variance here that is like, it's not

897
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,720
like related to the features of the technology or like our

898
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,640
fundamental technological ability, right? There's like a 5x

899
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,800
kind of difference that's kind of related to regulation,

900
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,200
economy, societal commitment, etc. Right? That's kind of where

901
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,480
where the explanation ultimately has to be. So I think

902
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,320
there's kind of lots of different reasons. I mean, one,

903
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,520
like, I guess, one most general one, which is not nuclear

904
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,760
specific is like in general, in the West, we're not able to

905
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,720
build things, right? It's not only that we're not able to build

906
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,720
nuclear plants, we're also not in Berlin, we're not even able to

907
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,760
build airports. So, so I think that's kind of like the general

908
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,280
class of like, there's lots of general stuff around like

909
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,120
regulation and kind of interest groups. But then there's also

910
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,920
like nuclear specific stuff, right? And I think it's

911
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,160
essentially, I think the most significant part is that

912
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,680
essentially the supply chain for for building nuclear in the

913
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,080
West has essentially fallen fallen apart, right? So like,

914
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,480
we're building things kind of in the first of a kind style, or

915
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,360
kind of not first of a kind, but like first in a decade or first

916
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,440
in a decade more, which is not the way to build like anything

917
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,640
kind of at scale anything efficiently. That's not how France

918
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,080
kind of built the nuclear fleet, right? So like, the most

919
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,920
successful example of building out nuclear quickly is like

920
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,520
France from the like late 70s to like late 80s. So that's, I

921
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:29,520
think, most of the explanation. What did France do right? I mean,

922
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,640
France was in a situation of emergency. So like the 1970s at

923
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,880
the time of like the big oil price shocks and like France is a

924
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:44,080
country without significant domestic energy supply. So they

925
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:48,880
were extremely exposed to the oil price shocks. And at the same

926
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,200
time, they were already in nuclear power, right? Like they

927
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,760
kind of have like nuclear expertise, very centralized

928
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,280
government. So yeah, they essentially decided, okay,

929
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,200
we're gonna build nuclear as like a national project, and that

930
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,680
kind of standardized it like one of like, both the same kind of

931
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,200
reactor, both the workforce in a very centralized fashion, if

932
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,680
you kind of compare this to the US, for example, where like

933
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,720
utilities are kind of really spread out across the country,

934
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,120
and like we're like, essentially, there's like not

935
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,600
someone who's buying like 100 nuclear plants, right? There's

936
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,840
kind of utilities that are buying like one reactor, or maybe

937
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,160
two reactors and one plant or something like that, right? So

938
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,320
like, the way that this happens was like fundamentally,

939
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,040
fundamentally different. So these were very special

940
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,520
circumstances. And like, just to be very clear, I'm not

941
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,680
suggesting that those are transferable to today, right? Like

942
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,120
it's not that the kind of shock or stress that France was under,

943
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,960
it's not something we can replicate and say, oh, we're all

944
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,440
we're all gonna build like to 80% nuclear in like 15 years,

945
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,280
because of climate change, most countries are not able to do

946
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,080
that. Like, technologically, they are, but like politically

947
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,480
speaking, it doesn't seem feasible.

948
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,600
Do you think we we need to develop new designs for nuclear

949
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:09,240
reactors? Do we need to move to better designs? Do we need a

950
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,120
molten salt reactors or something like this? Or are the

951
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,120
reactor designs we have today enough?

952
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,120
And this is, I think, an active debate in the like, in the

953
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,640
nuclear community. And I think like, it kind of depends on how

954
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,320
how do we define need in this context, right? So like, I

955
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,080
think, from purely technical perspective, right, there's

956
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,640
nothing wrong with existing nuclear power plants. So what's

957
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,720
wrong is kind of like when the fact that we're not able to

958
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,840
build them is kind of lack of societal commitment and like,

959
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,640
lack of learning and stuff like that, right? So like, we can

960
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,600
imagine a future where we built a lot of that. So the question

961
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,200
is, can we actually get into that future? The most significant

962
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,760
benefit of kind of advanced nuclear, like small, small

963
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,080
modular reactors is essentially, it seems more plausible that

964
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,800
this is kind of like, like, or there are countries where it

965
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,280
seems more plausible that we're going to build lots of small

966
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,120
modular reactors, because you can produce them and factories,

967
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,360
you can essentially exploit the same learning curve dynamics

968
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,920
that made renewables and electric cars and all other kind of

969
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,960
technologies that we were able to make cheap cheap. So that's

970
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,760
kind of another aspect. And it's also kind of playing much

971
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,240
better with like renewable dominated grid. So it's kind of

972
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,520
more flexible. And it's also like a smaller, smaller unit. So I

973
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,640
think there, yeah, I think, I mean, we are like philanthropically

974
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,400
speaking, we are we are betting on advanced nuclear or small

975
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,920
modular reactors. But I wouldn't say it's necessarily related

976
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,840
to like, technological problem with existing reactors is more

977
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,280
like, yeah, the whole, yeah, yes, one of the themes here, it's

978
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,680
not only about technology, it's about the whole like, societal

979
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,160
kind of apparatus around the technology.

980
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,360
And so the small modular reactors would be easier to

981
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,320
innovate on because you would you would be able to develop one

982
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,760
such reactor and deploy it and get feedback much, much more

983
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,720
quickly than you can with a with a larger reactor, where it might

984
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,280
take 15 years for it to to be built. And only then can you go

985
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,680
back and think about what you could have done differently. Is

986
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,360
it also a question of potentially you can you can mass

987
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,000
produce these small modular reactors? What are the

988
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,840
advantages here?

989
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,520
So like it is the mass production, right, the mass

990
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,160
production in a factory. So it's not only the 15 year thing,

991
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,200
right, like under ideal circumstances, you could also

992
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,360
build a large plant and something like four or six years,

993
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,000
like you could also learn something from large plants,

994
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,720
and you could build the same plant design over and over

995
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,800
again. But it's much easier to learn. And like, obviously, it's

996
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,920
like a controlled production environment, right? So like when

997
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,160
kind of most of the reduction happens in a factory, I mean,

998
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,040
obviously, some of the assembly has to happen on site, but like,

999
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,160
that is where you can really kind of expect a high learning

1000
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,600
rates, right? So that's kind of, yeah, essentially, applying the

1001
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,360
same mechanism by which we make, make other kind of

1002
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,840
technologies cheap to the nuclear case.

1003
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,680
One last technology I want to run through is geothermal. This is

1004
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,120
something that's maybe like hydro, it's potentially a bit

1005
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,880
overlooked. But yeah, how promising do you think geothermal

1006
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,520
energy is?

1007
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,880
So I would say much more promising than hydro. But I think

1008
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,920
also, geopharmals definitely having a moment right now, and

1009
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,520
it's becoming radically less overlooked. There's traditional

1010
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,800
geothermal, which is kind of great, but it's very location

1011
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,520
specific, right? So you're low location dependent, you kind of

1012
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,800
do it, build it in lots of places, because you kind of need

1013
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,720
essentially not, yeah, you need kind of good conditions, you

1014
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,920
need like, yeah, close to volcano, etc. So like, essentially,

1015
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,520
you need to be closer to heat source near in the ground. And

1016
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,000
then there's kind of like different forms of like advanced

1017
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,600
geothermal. And that's a little bit like, there's like lots of

1018
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,360
different ones, it's like six or seven different ones. But I

1019
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,240
guess the one that we've been focusing on traditionally is

1020
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,600
what you would call ultra deep geothermal or like a super

1021
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,800
hot rock geothermal, where essentially, you're going so

1022
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,640
deep, that you can kind of make it much less location

1023
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,880
dependent, and also kind of get much, much warmer, what much

1024
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,320
hotter fuel, so you kind of get more, more energy density to

1025
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,040
get more favorable economics. And then that's kind of the idea

1026
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,400
of like, geothermal anywhere. So if you're kind of able to drill

1027
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,880
like, five kilometers or five down, yeah, that could be very

1028
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,520
promising. And that's kind of like, in general, this is not

1029
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,580
only true for super hot or ultra deep, but also kind of more

1030
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,360
generally for like innovations, you're formal. What this does,

1031
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,760
it's kind of leveraging the advances of the fracking of the

1032
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,960
Shea gas revolution, right? So like our ability to drill has

1033
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,000
been like, strongly increased through the through the fracking

1034
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,360
revolution and essentially applying this to to geothermal

1035
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,960
is kind of where a lot of the innovations coming from. And

1036
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:59,560
it's kind of very attractive, because once you make it work,

1037
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,480
right, you need to solve a couple of material science

1038
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,880
challenges here. But like, once those are solved, you have like

1039
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,120
a very mature labor force, and you kind of have like large

1040
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,320
economic interests, oil and gas, that will be quite

1041
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,600
interesting on that. So in that sense, it's kind of an innovation

1042
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,840
that is kind of locked in, if you will, right? So like, it's kind

1043
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,040
of not locked out, like

1044
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, but if we're talking about drilling five kilometers down,

1045
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,080
this is not something you could do in in a person's backyard. So

1046
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,080
this is not as decentralized as for example, setting up solar

1047
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,720
panels on a on a roof in a residential neighborhood.

1048
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,160
No, it's solving the same problem that small modular

1049
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,360
reactors or like other kind of clean firm sources will solve,

1050
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,880
right? So it's not this is not about everyone having a super

1051
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,080
hot rock thing in their backyard. But this is about solving the

1052
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,640
hard part of electricity decarbonization, which is kind of

1053
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,920
clean firm resources, right? So like, not intermittent

1054
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,640
renewables, but something that can be dispatched and it can be

1055
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,320
used the entire time.

1056
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,880
I guess technically, this is not a renewable form of energy,

1057
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,320
but in a, in a kind of practical sense, it will take

1058
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,200
billions of years for the earth's heat to dissipate enough for

1059
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,440
this technology not not to work. So in practical terms, it's

1060
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,160
it's renewable.

1061
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,160
Yeah, in practical terms, I think the distinction renewable and

1062
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,440
not doesn't matter because I mean, renewables also require lots

1063
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,080
of non renewables, like resources to like, like, right, like in a

1064
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,440
way, so like the minerals that you need for like solar and wind

1065
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,120
and so like, so yeah, it's, it's not a, it's not a practical

1066
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,040
thing to worry about. But nor nor should you kind of worry

1067
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,200
about uranium running out or stuff like that.

1068
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,440
Okay, we've, we've done an overview of a lot of the

1069
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,760
technological options we have. If you were to to rank these

1070
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,360
technologies and think about, you know, a plan for how we might

1071
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,920
solve climate climate change using a combination of them. Where

1072
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,600
would you where do you see most promise in the short term and in

1073
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,200
the long term?

1074
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,960
I mean, in the short term, it's very clear that like intermittent

1075
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:13,400
renewables and natural gas will like do most of the like heavy

1076
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,680
lifting and decarbonization in the near future. So like, because

1077
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,160
they are quick to build and they're kind of quickly expanding

1078
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,560
right and like, okay, in some places also adding nuclear

1079
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,640
capacity, and also many other places like not prematurely

1080
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,880
shutting down nuclear capacity, right? So like, yeah, so those

1081
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,800
are I think kind of the short term and then hydropower, the

1082
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:38,240
short term options. And the medium runs something like, well,

1083
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:41,840
like advances in geothermal or advances in small modular

1084
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,160
reactors, right, could kind of address what right now is kind

1085
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,680
of a little bit of the Achilles heel of kind of electricity

1086
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,920
decarbonization, which is kind of clean for power, right? So like

1087
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,000
that's kind of why those are still important and like worth

1088
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,080
doing, even though like renewables right now are cheap,

1089
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,840
and there's kind of this like seduction of like only relying

1090
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,360
on existing technologies. But like, the reason to not do that

1091
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,040
is like the risk that we talked about before, but also kind of

1092
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,800
the energy system function of like clean firm, which right now

1093
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,600
is kind of not adequately solved. And when you say clean

1094
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,760
firm, what do you mean? Well, so clean, right, means like zero

1095
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,480
emissions and like zero air pollution and like otherwise

1096
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,840
clean. So like that includes nuclear that includes geothermal

1097
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:30,680
that includes fusion. If it were, if it were to happen. And firm

1098
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,880
here means that it's essentially it is not an intermittent

1099
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,160
resource, right? It's kind of not like solar and wind that is

1100
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:43,280
kind of so yeah, it can in principle be run 24 seven. And

1101
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,160
you will not use it for electricity 24 seven, but you

1102
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,280
might use it for for producing hydrogen at other times of the

1103
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,200
day. But like, yeah, essentially, that you're reducing what

1104
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,280
storage kind of needs to do, right? Like it's becomes a lot

1105
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,280
like building an energy system that has like clean firm

1106
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,360
resources in it, like it's a lot more realistic to get to like

1107
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,080
100% kind of clean than if you're kind of entirely batting

1108
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,720
on intermittent resources.

1109
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,520
Yeah, so you think thinking across the different climate

1110
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,160
scenarios, it's a it will be smart strategy for us to also

1111
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,320
invest in some of these clean firm technologies and not just

1112
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,480
traditional renewables like wind and solar.

1113
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,800
Okay, yeah, so I think it's kind of worth distinguishing two

1114
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:33,280
separate strands of the argument here, even on kind of a normal

1115
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,160
kind of trajectory where renewables are very successful,

1116
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,160
like clean firm is kind of a useful compliment, right? And it

1117
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,520
makes the overall system more efficient, it kind of like reduces

1118
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:49,040
the like the necessity to like overbuild intermittent renewables

1119
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,400
reduces the necessity of storage, etc. Right. So like, the case

1120
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,760
for clean firms not entirely like hedging one, but then there's

1121
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,480
also kind of the hedging one, which is like, I think we talked

1122
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,360
about this before, right? Like, if we kind of wake up in 2040,

1123
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,000
and like, our situation looks much worse than we're thinking

1124
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,240
now, like, what has gone wrong? Well, one of the main things

1125
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,640
that could have gone wrong is that like expanding solar and

1126
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,080
wind was much hotter. And in that sense, investments in and

1127
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,720
clean firm are like a hedge against that. And there's a key

1128
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,360
fact of like climate that makes the hedging quality important.

1129
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,000
And that's essentially like the shape of climate damage. So that

1130
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
climate damage to kind of like, or our expectation of like how

1131
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,160
climate damage looks like is that it's kind of strongly

1132
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,480
nonlinear. So like, world with six degrees is like much worse

1133
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,320
than twice as bad than a world of three degrees and the world

1134
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,600
with three degrees much worse than twice as bad than 1.5

1135
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,080
degrees. So it's kind of particularly important, right? I

1136
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,560
mean, you need to control for how likely those are. But like,

1137
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,320
it's like, even if you kind of control for how likely there

1138
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,880
are, it's kind of important to like, favor solutions that work

1139
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,200
in situations where a lot of damage is. So those are kind of

1140
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,000
right now, I would say those little worlds kind of more

1141
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,120
reflect 2.5 degrees like 2.5 to 3.5, like those are reasonably

1142
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,320
likely and reasonably more damaging than the worst cases

1143
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,080
that I kind of take a lot of the expected damage and the

1144
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,040
function. And under those, like if you're in those

1145
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,320
situations, right, you kind of, you know, something,

1146
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,960
probabilistically speaking, you know, you know, something that

1147
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,360
is likely to have happened in those worlds. Like one thing

1148
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,720
is likely to have happened is that renewables will have like,

1149
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,280
yeah, been more curtailed than we expect.

1150
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,680
Okay, and I think we'll discuss this more later, thinking

1151
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,520
about different climate scenarios and where we should spend our

1152
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:41,160
money in, to kind of cover all scenarios. But before we get

1153
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,200
there, I want to talk about some governmental options. What

1154
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,040
could governments do in order to help this situation? You

1155
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:54,800
mentioned before how European governments and California was

1156
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,960
able to subsidize renewables to such an extent that they are

1157
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,080
now quite cheap. In general, what's your sense of how well

1158
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,480
subsidies work? Would you recommend that governments try

1159
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,400
to pick out which which energy technologies they favor and then

1160
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,400
subsidize those?

1161
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,120
The broad answer to which Mrs. Canter relates to like, what is

1162
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,200
what, how good is the government at picking winners and

1163
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,680
like, how far should the government pick winners? I think

1164
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,680
like, the broad answer is here, like, the government was

1165
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,800
heavily involved in every kind of important technological

1166
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,840
success when it comes to energy and climate, and also like

1167
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,480
heavily involved in lots of different failures. So like on

1168
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,840
the success, right, we have like solar, we have electric cars,

1169
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,880
we have wind, we have nuclear, we have fracking. On the failure,

1170
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,720
we have stuff like cylindra, we have stuff like biofuels in the

1171
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,720
US, which are like subsidized because they're kind of big in

1172
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,840
Iowa and Iowa is important for presidential elections. Like, so

1173
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,720
like, you have like the good, the bad and the ugly kind of all

1174
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,360
all together, right? So like, that's important, right? It's

1175
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,600
like, it's not, there's essentially no example of

1176
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,760
like energy technology transformation that kind of where

1177
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,840
government has not played a huge role. So I think that that's

1178
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:14,280
something worth, like worth remembering kind of to start. And

1179
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:19,280
it's also there's no because there's no clear example where

1180
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,120
essentially technology has been an energy technology has been

1181
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:27,880
brought about primarily by market forces, right? So like, so

1182
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,320
like there's demonstration projects, those are often

1183
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,440
public or like at least publicly, partially publicly

1184
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,000
funded. Then there's kind of about this basic R&D where like

1185
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,640
government also plays a big role demonstration projects. And

1186
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,360
there's kind of like early procurement policies like across

1187
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,680
the entire chain of the environment of the innovation

1188
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:51,080
process government plays a huge role. And I think there isn't

1189
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,720
really an alternative to this or like we haven't really

1190
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,720
observed an alternative to this. So I think the view that I

1191
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,880
would kind of house like in general kind of government is

1192
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,920
much better than its reputation. Because like once electric cars

1193
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,320
get cheap, then we're all celebrating Elon Musk, but we're

1194
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,680
like forgetting the fact that like, there's like huge electric

1195
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:14,120
car subsidies that like may Tesla possible, right? Like, and I

1196
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,240
mean, there's a similar story, like not to pick on Elon Musk,

1197
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,280
right? There's a similar story for like most other kind of

1198
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,480
technological successes. At the end, there's kind of a private

1199
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,000
company that's kind of doing the last mile, that's getting a

1200
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,920
lot of the attention. But like before, or even at that last

1201
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,160
stage, there's huge, huge involvement by the government. So

1202
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,680
I think that's that's what I can say to, to start. So government

1203
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,280
will make mistakes. But I think the alternative is not to not

1204
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,960
let the government pick. Ideally, and I think that's what we're

1205
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,880
kind of seeing in the United States right now. You're

1206
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:51,240
essentially trying to support technology at the right, at the

1207
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,640
right level, right? So like, you shouldn't choose all

1208
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,920
technologies. And you should also like be humble in terms of

1209
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,040
like, you cannot pick all the winners. But right now, if you

1210
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,320
look at the the inflation reduction act, and the

1211
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,240
infrastructure bill selected to major pieces of kind of climate

1212
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,920
policy change in the United States are now, they're

1213
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,280
essentially like very broad, that's unlike lots of different

1214
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,440
technologies. And they're very kind of on the one hand, like

1215
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,680
then an infrastructure bill like R&D driven, in the case of the

1216
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,120
inflation reduction act more like subsidy and later stage

1217
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,120
technology driven, like, I guess they're a very strong form of

1218
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,680
government involvement. But in a way, they're taking a lot of

1219
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,040
winners, or like some of them will not be winners, right? So

1220
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,640
like, they're, they're kind of very, very broad on their, their

1221
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,680
approach to their credit.

1222
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,880
And do you think that's the right strategy to subsidize or to

1223
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,600
support from the government side across the right range of

1224
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,600
technologies and across different stages of technological

1225
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,120
development?

1226
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,720
So if we're saying that history is informative, then I think

1227
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,280
that's kind of what history teaches us about like innovation

1228
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,200
and energy. Yes.

1229
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,680
Are there any research and development into one of the

1230
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,240
the forms of energy technology we talked about that you think

1231
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,000
the government should spend more money on? Should the

1232
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,400
government be subsidizing at a later stage of development, some

1233
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,360
of these technologies?

1234
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,840
So like, I guess the contextualized the moment that

1235
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,000
we're in, right? So like we're in, well, mid 20 or mid to late

1236
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,880
2023, and like, both in the United States, and to a lesser

1237
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,120
degree also in Europe, like we've seen like major climate

1238
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,680
policies over the last year, right? So like, like in the, in

1239
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,800
the United States was focused on that case, right? So like the

1240
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,560
inflation reduction act was passed, like essentially almost

1241
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,600
exactly a year ago, a year before the infrastructure was

1242
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,240
passed. Like both of those are kind of like, putting support

1243
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,080
for clean energy, essentially on a whole order of magnitude,

1244
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,880
kind of different levels. So we're now subsidizing or the

1245
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,880
inflation reduction act, we're going to subsidize renewable,

1246
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,920
like only renewables, clean energy, and other kind of

1247
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,280
clean technologies on the order of like, 300 billion, at least

1248
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,880
and could go, could go, could go higher than this. We are in a

1249
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:02,480
situation where like, money is not the primary constraint right

1250
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,720
now, for most kind of energy innovation, or it's kind of

1251
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,960
like, it's much more harder to make that case, right? Like,

1252
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,960
that doesn't mean we're in a situation where everything is

1253
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,520
kind of going great, right? It's more that kind of the

1254
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,280
challenges maybe more like stuff like permitting reform, or

1255
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,360
kind of making those demonstration projects

1256
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,480
happening, or like, in the case of nuclear reforming the nuclear

1257
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,680
regulatory commission. So it's not so much about money being

1258
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:32,600
the limiting constraint that and like, for the second part of

1259
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,880
the question, should they support at a later stage? Yes,

1260
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,640
absolutely. So I think the basic, the basic problem in the

1261
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:43,280
discourse, I think is that there's relatively broad support

1262
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,520
for like, basic research and development, right, like support

1263
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,080
for that is kind of very kind of mainstream, right, like lots of

1264
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,920
conservatives will kind of support investment and basic,

1265
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,320
basic R&D, because there's a very clear market failure there,

1266
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,680
it's very well recognized. So it's kind of very bipartisan, or

1267
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,520
at least there's kind of like a broad kind of set of people

1268
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,840
that will support that. But like the like the area where most

1269
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,600
failure happens kind of in the later stages is kind of like

1270
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,800
getting 100 million for a demonstration project. So that's

1271
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,080
something that historically in the United States, for example,

1272
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:21,000
has been hard to kind of get political buy-in to fund this

1273
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,200
work, right? Because it's also like, when you fail, you fail

1274
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,600
very recently, right? So like Mitt Romney in 2012, like started

1275
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,640
his campaign at the Solyndra plan, right? Like Solyndra being

1276
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,400
like kind of the example of the failure of kind of the clean

1277
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,040
energy investments of the Obama administration. So maybe, maybe

1278
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,120
explain what happened there. I'm not familiar with the, is it

1279
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,320
called Solyndra?

1280
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,960
Yeah, so like Solyndra was kind of like an advanced solar company

1281
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,360
that kind of was kind of heavily supported by the American

1282
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,920
Reinvestment Act, so kind of the small scale version of what

1283
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,920
Biden did now, like enlarge with inflation reduction act, kind

1284
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,880
of like so the recovery after honey, 18, the clean energy

1285
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,360
spending there. And Solyndra was kind of a very, very public

1286
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:08,760
failure of a company that was kind of heavily backed by the

1287
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,880
government. And yeah, essentially became the symbol of

1288
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,960
like, okay, the government is really bad at picking winners,

1289
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,440
right? And like, that kind of happened. At the same time as

1290
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,920
kind of the shale gas revolution was playing out, right?

1291
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,560
We're like, also the government had kind of played a big, big

1292
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,760
role in supporting that. So it's just like, we're very selective

1293
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,640
and like picking our examples.

1294
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,200
What do you think about carbon taxes? This is a solution to

1295
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,480
climate change that's often favored by economists, where

1296
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,680
you you simply price the negative externality of

1297
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,920
emissions, and then you let the market figure out how to

1298
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,240
implement the how to reduce emissions. Do you think carbon

1299
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,720
taxes could work? So and I guess I mentioned this in the

1300
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,360
beginning, but just just to recap. So before I joined

1301
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,480
founder slash, I spent five years working on carbon pricing

1302
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,680
emission trading system, carbon taxes. So I'm very familiar

1303
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:05,280
with those debates. I mean, I think they can work. But I think

1304
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,280
they will not play, like a major role in kind of the solution.

1305
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,760
And just like to give a couple of, couple of like arguments,

1306
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,800
why? So if you're like thinking again about kind of the

1307
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:21,240
example of like solar, and how solar got cheap. So the

1308
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,000
subsidies that kind of Germany was able to kind of that were

1309
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,240
politically feasible in the early 2000s in Germany. You could

1310
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,960
have achieved them with a carbon tax between like 700 to 900

1311
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,240
something in that range, dollars per ton. That's an

1312
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:40,120
insanely high carbon tax. So like at that point, most of the

1313
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,760
world had no carbon taxes at all, right, like Germany had no

1314
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,760
carbon tax at all, like the only kind of countries having

1315
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,840
carbon taxes for like, Scandinavian countries. And like

1316
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,960
even then, like the highest carbon tax will be something like

1317
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:57,400
$50 a ton, right? So like, the really kind of transformative

1318
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,560
price signal that you need to like drive an immature

1319
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:06,400
technology, you will probably never get where the carbon tax

1320
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,600
that's politically feasible, right? Like you could not, it's

1321
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,720
not that you could have had the carbon tax at that level at that

1322
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,040
time. So I think that's kind of one reason, right? And now we're

1323
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,120
essentially like now we're essentially this situation where

1324
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,560
like solar were kind of the difference to the fossil fuel

1325
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,000
alternative was kind of zero in many cases, right? You wouldn't

1326
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,640
need a carbon tax. Essentially, to solve climate change, you need

1327
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,240
fundamental technological transformation. And for that, you

1328
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,520
need like very, very strong push and you cannot get this kind of

1329
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:41,720
push with a with a politically feasible price. So that's kind

1330
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,600
one constraint. And the other constraint is kind of the

1331
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:50,800
international situation. So if you were in a situation where you

1332
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,560
would have a global carbon tax, right, like maybe or a global

1333
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:57,600
kind of carbon price, maybe that would be enough to kind of

1334
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,560
induce some some innovation, etc. But like, you never, like,

1335
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,640
it's very far, very far from getting there. So I think right

1336
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,360
now we're in a situation where it's very clear that the most

1337
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,480
significant things that like individual countries can do, like

1338
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,720
in a situation where international coordination is

1339
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,320
relatively weak, are not about kind of introducing a carbon

1340
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:25,880
tax, like had Germany introduced the carbon tax in 2005,

1341
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,040
this would have or sorry, in 2005, we got the emission

1342
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,800
trading system. So let's say if we had like introduced like

1343
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,720
reasonably high carbon prices early in the 2000s, would have

1344
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,440
kind of accelerated like transition from like German

1345
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,160
coal to Russian gas, that would have been the main effect

1346
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,360
would not have had like transformative effects,

1347
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,240
globally speaking, right? So like, that's, I think, the really

1348
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:53,080
big constraint there. So essentially, yeah, carbon

1349
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:59,040
taxes might play a role. Once all technologies are reasonably

1350
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,120
close to competitiveness, and then kind of iron out a little

1351
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:07,360
bit on the on the margin. But I guess that that's kind of like

1352
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:10,080
not not the point where it really matters anymore.

1353
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,480
Yeah, and just just to check with you, what do you what do you

1354
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:18,160
think about planting trees? Is that with that work at all? Is

1355
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:22,720
that on the kind of what would that have a large enough effect

1356
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:27,320
to matter? You sometimes hear claims about the importance of

1357
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:33,680
the Amazon rainforest, for example, as a way of decreasing

1358
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:38,960
CO2 in the atmosphere, could the government initiate a large

1359
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,640
kind of projects of planting more forest for that work?

1360
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,040
So I mean, in principle, the easier thing had should always be

1361
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,400
avoiding deforestation, because planting trees to like to have

1362
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,000
a carbon effect, right, like it takes 20 years. It's not

1363
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,160
instantaneously useful. I mean, I guess, I guess to start with

1364
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:02,520
again, now we kind of need to refocus on, we're talking here

1365
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,040
on the margin. And when we talk about trees, everyone loves

1366
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,560
trees. Like the person I meet the most, like the superficial

1367
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,080
kind of climate person I meet the most, right? Like the first

1368
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,600
like, they want to like they want to plant trees, like that's

1369
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,240
the first thing that essentially everyone kind of coming into

1370
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,520
this conversation jumps to.

1371
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,400
Yeah, this is exactly why I brought it up, because I'm

1372
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,320
guessing that this proposal would be extremely popular with a

1373
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:29,520
kind of broad public and maybe that itself, even though planting

1374
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,040
trees may may not be the most effective thing. Just the fact

1375
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,720
that it's so popular might mean that it's it's easier to

1376
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,280
implement. And that could be an argument for it.

1377
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:41,360
Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, you would need to do a certain

1378
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,240
insane scale. But so if you if we're thinking about the kind of

1379
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,320
the existing solution on this base, which is essentially about

1380
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,320
like rainforest protection, right? And like there we have kind

1381
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:56,920
of an international carbon market around protecting rain

1382
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,200
forests, like called web plus. And the basic idea there is like

1383
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:08,840
you're rewarding countries for avoiding deforestation. So and

1384
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,000
like the most significant example of this is like between

1385
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,520
Norway and Brazil, where like Norway kind of tried to like pay

1386
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,800
Brazil lots of money to kind of like, yeah, save kind of like

1387
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,360
deforest less. And the problem with that is I think

1388
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,920
fundamentally that you're rewarding something you can't

1389
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,760
observe, like you're rewarding counterfactual, like you're

1390
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,240
rewarding, of additionally avoided deforestation, which is

1391
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,520
not something you can observe, right? So like your and so like

1392
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,840
that is kind of hard on the best case. And it's like,

1393
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,800
essentially impossible when you have like sovereign nation states

1394
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,440
that all can kind of have their own, their own estimates. So

1395
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,680
that's one of the problems. And the other problem, of course,

1396
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:57,160
is kind of a snot. Like the main benefit of like avoiding

1397
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,880
deforestation comes from the long term again, right? So like,

1398
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,160
but you can't really have like credible, credible commitments

1399
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,160
over like decades in terms of protecting trees. So like it's

1400
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:12,120
a solution that like looks seductively simple, but kind of

1401
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,640
in practice, kind of doesn't work. Yeah, so like that's kind of

1402
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,880
the case for avoiding deforestation and for planting

1403
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,600
trees. Yeah, I mean, you need to do those on an extremely

1404
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,600
massive scale. And like, it's not going to have large effects

1405
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,920
kind of in the, in the short term.

1406
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,720
Yeah, are there any other non technological options that you

1407
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,960
like, or that you find promising?

1408
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,120
There's lots of other things we can do, right? So like, I think

1409
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,840
one thing that we should talk about briefly would be climate

1410
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,240
finance. So which is essentially the idea of like

1411
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,560
incentivizing lower income countries for like building or

1412
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,000
like paying essentially paying more clean energy

1413
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,800
infrastructure. Yeah, in principle, that's one of the

1414
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,240
things that you would expect if we had a global carbon market,

1415
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,160
right? Because like abating abating emissions should be

1416
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,040
cheaper in a lower income country. So that's another

1417
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,760
approach of kind of a software from many of the problems I've

1418
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,400
now talked about with regards to with regards to rainforest

1419
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,320
protection. So that's another approach that I think we should

1420
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,640
mention. And then there's kind of when you're kind of in a

1421
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,080
situation where you have a lot of growth happening, right? So if

1422
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,160
you're kind of an emerging Asia right now, there is a lot of

1423
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:27,560
variance and like how emission intensive that growth can be. So

1424
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:32,040
like we've just hired a carbon looking specialist who like she

1425
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,480
will kind of look at what what are the interventions we can do

1426
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,040
there. But like if you kind of look at the literature, you can

1427
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,440
kind of see like clear differences related to, yeah,

1428
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,240
like how our city is being built and these kind of things like

1429
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:49,360
kind of shape essentially shaping long run behavioral

1430
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,160
patterns by like different forms of infrastructure

1431
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,360
investments.

1432
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:57,080
Yeah, and you mentioned supporting innovation or

1433
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,280
innovation policy.

1434
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,000
And that's kind of ties to what we've talked about before,

1435
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,960
right, which is like, the government is essential for

1436
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,720
technological transformation. What the government does can be

1437
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:13,160
affected by advocacy, you can kind of fund through like where

1438
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,520
you can find a charity to do this kind of work. And it is it

1439
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,720
locks it kind of souls for this like what I described is like

1440
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:24,200
the central conundrum of climate policy, right, that kind of

1441
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:29,720
essentially the gas that you have like way more leverage through

1442
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,720
innovation on like global emission outcomes than like

1443
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,720
through their territorial emissions. So you have this

1444
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,760
potential for trajectory changing dynamics, right, that we've

1445
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,720
kind of been discussing with the example of solar electric cars

1446
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:47,600
et cetera that relatively small changes in the world, like in

1447
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:51,640
the large in the grand scheme of things, right, like California

1448
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,360
aggressively supporting electric cars or Denmark aggressively

1449
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:58,160
supporting wind power, these are like small changes on the world

1450
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,960
but like huge long term consequences. So I think that's

1451
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,280
kind of the thing and like the other things that I would

1452
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,560
mention, so like kind of on the on the carbon carbon lock inside

1453
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,040
would be stuff like, yeah, essentially regulatory reform,

1454
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,680
right. And the US this would be something like permitting

1455
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,400
reform, which which will become like a hot issue or is already

1456
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,480
becoming a hot issue because the financing for clean energy is

1457
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,840
there but the permits and the regulation is not there. And

1458
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,400
they're similar similar issues and like emerging emerging

1459
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,920
economies. So it's not all about technological innovation, not

1460
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,400
at all. Right. It's also about like, yeah, shaping the

1461
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:43,800
regulatory frameworks, etc. And here you're using

1462
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:49,040
some amount of money in order to influence a much bigger amount

1463
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,440
of money. Basically, you're using philanthropic dollars to

1464
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:56,040
influence the dollars or the money spent by governments.

1465
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,720
Yeah. So for everything that we're kind of funding and

1466
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:04,000
there's always there's always kind of advocacy and the broader

1467
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:07,680
sense of the term. So I'm kind of saying essentially, using

1468
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,800
philanthropy to influence much larger budgets, right? And like

1469
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:14,560
like that reasoning comes from the fact that like, all government

1470
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,400
budgets are like several orders of magnitude, like two to three

1471
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:22,560
orders of magnitudes, larger than philanthropy. And also, I

1472
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,840
think what we've already touched on, right, like, there's

1473
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,000
things that kind of essentially need the government, even if it's

1474
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,200
like changing regulation, etc. Right. So like, most impact

1475
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,240
focused philanthropy and climate is ultimately about kind of

1476
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:38,120
shaping actions of the government, you know, or other large

1477
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:38,920
actors.

1478
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,920
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I do wonder, though, aren't

1479
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:47,000
there a lot of kind of interest groups trying to get the

1480
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,400
government to spend money on on various things. And so you might

1481
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,080
there might be a lot of competition for influence over

1482
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,000
over the government's resources.

1483
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:00,200
When I just talked about like the different sizes of the

1484
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:06,000
changes in the world, that kind of relates relates to this. So I

1485
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,360
think that the best case or like the kind of the highest impact

1486
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,360
case for like philanthropy to have like a large impact on

1487
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,720
government policy is kind of in situations where there's like

1488
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,240
relatively little attention, right? So like, if we're kind of

1489
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,040
thinking about the counter example of like the carbon

1490
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,160
tax, like needs national attention needs like bipartisan

1491
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,040
support to be passed definitely needs national

1492
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,960
conversation. Like that's probably a situation where like an

1493
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,400
additional fund traffic dollar will not make a large difference

1494
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,880
because kind of like lots of other money is involved. But when

1495
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,800
you're kind of in a situation where like, you know, okay, we're

1496
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,800
going to pass this big climate bill. And like, there's a big

1497
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,160
national conversation about we want to do this, the climate

1498
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:54,320
bill, but ultimately, like how exactly does this climate bill

1499
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:58,400
look like, which technology does support and how that is kind of

1500
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,280
a thing, the sweet spot for kind of philanthropy, right,

1501
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,760
because we're essentially lots of political science literature

1502
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,040
for like how this kind of works. It's what's called like

1503
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,120
legislative subsidy. So there's kind of special charities that

1504
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,440
kind of specialize and like knowing which legislation would

1505
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,440
be needed to kind of promote a given technology or given

1506
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:21,200
approach. And yeah, essentially providing providing that

1507
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:25,000
knowledge to the policymakers. So I think that's kind of a way

1508
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,720
in which in which charities can have a large influence and kind

1509
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:34,640
of policy fields that are less politicized and that are kind

1510
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,040
of like under, yeah, that are kind of not not not super not

1511
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,120
super crowded. Yeah,

1512
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,640
let's give an overview of the different climate scenarios. So

1513
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,840
what's most likely to happen with the climate and specifically,

1514
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,320
I think we should talk about the worst cases and how likely

1515
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:51,840
those are.

1516
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,640
If you kind of look at the forecast, there's something like

1517
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:00,760
one third probability that we will kind of meet global climate

1518
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:04,880
targets. So that would be like limiting warming to two degrees.

1519
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,840
Then there's kind of about another third for something

1520
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,080
like between two, two and three degrees. And then there's kind

1521
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:16,320
of another third for everything kind of above three degrees from

1522
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:20,600
up to like five degrees. So this is kind of from a we can we can

1523
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,640
link this in the show notes, but like that's kind of from an

1524
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:25,840
from an LSE paper that kind of try to try to estimate those

1525
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,360
last year. And but like, there's different ways to estimate

1526
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,480
this, but it's kind of like broadly, broadly consistent. So

1527
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,720
like, we're probably not in current trajectory is not going

1528
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,160
to meet the global climate targets. We're gonna overshoot

1529
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:44,600
them by a degree or so. At the same time, right, kind of the

1530
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,280
really extreme scenarios, like six degrees or something like

1531
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:51,640
that has become like, very, very significantly less likely

1532
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,120
compared to what we believe like five or six years ago.

1533
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,880
Yeah, maybe you could describe some of the effects of the

1534
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
these different degrees of heating. It's a bit abstract

1535
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,400
when we're talking in terms of degrees, could you describe

1536
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,200
some of the effects of different degrees of heating?

1537
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,880
I mean, again, like this is of course an area where there's

1538
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,680
always like huge uncertainties, right? So like, we're like, if

1539
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,520
you look at the bars, like when do certain phenomena starts

1540
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,800
is kind of always like, okay, this could start at two degrees,

1541
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,720
because start at four and five degrees. I mean, the thing that

1542
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,920
we're kind of like right now, we're kind of in a situation where

1543
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,560
we can, where we can essentially see climate change in our

1544
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,240
daily lives, right, where kind of the temperature extremes

1545
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:32,720
have clearly changed. Also, like where like many, not all, but

1546
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,160
like kind of many kind of natural disasters have a climate

1547
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,080
change signal on there, right? So it kind of become more likely

1548
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,440
or more intense related to climate change. So that's kind of

1549
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:47,640
where we are right now. It's broadly kind of, I guess, probably

1550
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,560
think these things have become more, more intense. Then if

1551
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:54,240
you're kind of, I guess if you're hitting two degrees or more

1552
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:58,240
than like tipping point, tipping points become somewhat more

1553
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,680
likely. So there are elements in the climate system that either

1554
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,160
would kind of have like local environment effects or like

1555
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,560
dieback on the Amazon, for example, or kind of have like

1556
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,320
global climate effects, like shifting global temperature up

1557
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,600
by a half a degree or something of that sort. So those kind of

1558
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:19,080
things become kind of become happening, happening more as we

1559
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,400
moving higher up. Yeah, I think that's kind of the main thing.

1560
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,960
So I would say this is pretty abstract. The reason for that is

1561
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,960
this is not really what I'm not really spending a lot of time on

1562
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,720
that. I'm mostly interested, like, give them what I'm doing

1563
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,520
day to day, I'm mostly interested in understanding the

1564
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,440
shape of the curve, and how likely the different futures are

1565
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,400
because that's kind of what's most relevant for me to prioritize.

1566
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,000
And so are you prioritizing the worst case scenarios?

1567
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,880
No. And I'm really happy that you asked this because this is a

1568
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,720
very typical misunderstanding. So what I'm essentially arguing for

1569
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:55,560
and I will talk about this, which we can also link like on the

1570
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,200
structure of climate risk and its implications for high

1571
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,800
impact philanthropy. What I'm essentially asked arguing for is

1572
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,520
we treat this the same that we will treat other problems. So

1573
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:09,440
like, we're essentially looking at expected damage, right? So

1574
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:13,560
like an expected damage is the product of two different things

1575
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:16,920
is like the probability of different futures and how bad

1576
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:23,840
those futures would be. And right now, most of the probability

1577
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,920
mass, so when we put these things together, based on the

1578
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,240
current estimates would be on the other side, I think, like

1579
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:33,360
above, like most of the damage would be above 2.5 to 3.5. But

1580
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,800
crucially, it would not be in like six degrees or more. Because

1581
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,840
that's like, even though those worlds will be extremely

1582
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,640
damaging, they've become so much less likely that they're so

1583
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,920
that kind of the degree, like the low likelihood kind of

1584
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:48,000
dominates the strength of the signal. So it's not about just

1585
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,120
focusing on the worst world is kind of taking an expected

1586
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:57,400
damage. And the alternative to this, that I'm criticizing is

1587
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,480
essentially much of the focus of the climate community, where

1588
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,640
it's like, black and white, like either we meet the goal of the

1589
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,440
Paris Agreement or we don't, like there's all of this massive

1590
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,440
complexity that you talked about. And we're just reducing it

1591
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,960
to, okay, on a two degree trajectory, we will need this

1592
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,160
and this and this. And like, that's kind of, I guess, in a way,

1593
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,640
the wrong question. Where do you see the most expected damage

1594
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,880
then? Yeah, so and the last time we ran these numbers, and we

1595
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,760
should run them again this year. But like, it's kind of, I

1596
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,800
think, in those worlds that are both reasonably likely, and

1597
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,840
also much more like significantly more damaging

1598
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,400
than kind of the best case worlds, right? So they will be like

1599
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:39,400
worlds of like 2.5 to 3.5 degrees, roughly, that's kind of

1600
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:44,680
where the bulk of the damages. So those are worlds where the

1601
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,840
Paris Agreement has not succeeded, right? Because me, the

1602
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,840
Paris Agreement's goal is to limit temperature to two

1603
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,360
degrees. They're also like worlds where like, yeah, some

1604
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:57,200
things must must clearly have gone wrong. They're also not

1605
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:01,360
worlds like those worlds are not consistent with like, super

1606
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,200
cheap renewables, easy seasonal storage, etc. Yeah.

1607
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:09,000
Yeah. And in those worlds, what are the most promising

1608
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,760
interventions to alleviate the expected damage?

1609
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:17,480
The method here is, let's think about, because we're in a

1610
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:20,520
situation of extreme uncertainty, about lots of

1611
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:22,960
different things, like how much our economy is going to grow,

1612
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,920
how carbon tensiles is going to be, how will different

1613
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:30,400
technologies play out, how strong will the climate react? And

1614
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,080
all of these things are highly uncertain. But we're trying to

1615
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,200
understand, what do we know about the structure here? Like,

1616
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,560
what do we know? What is more likely to be true in a worse

1617
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,920
world, essentially? So like, on the technological level, or we

1618
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:45,880
already talked about this, right? So like, okay, a typical,

1619
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:50,040
like there's kind of two, two typical, or two, I think, failure

1620
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,440
moods that people would expect. Like one is kind of like,

1621
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,000
renewables do not scale as much. Another would kind of be that

1622
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:01,080
electrification doesn't scale as much, right? So that's kind of

1623
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:06,040
related. So if renewables don't scale as much, then like, the

1624
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:09,120
clean firm power sources that we talked about, right, those are

1625
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,920
kind of, we're gonna play a relatively larger role. So like,

1626
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,240
a significant part of the motivation of like, investing in

1627
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,880
geothermal, investing in advanced nuclear kind of comes not all

1628
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:24,160
of it, but like, comes from that. There's of course, also like

1629
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:27,960
other aspects to this, right? It's not only about the choice of

1630
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,360
energy technology, it's also about like, different kinds of

1631
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,600
solutions. So if you're kind of thinking about those futures,

1632
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,160
like those are not futures, where, as a side, like, international

1633
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:45,000
cooperation on climate, like being in a great shape is not

1634
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:50,280
consistent with being in the 3.5 world. So that means that

1635
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,440
things that kind of maybe look very good on the best case,

1636
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,840
right? Like if the best case is kind of like the case that we're

1637
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:01,160
in right now, or probably even better, let's say, saving trees

1638
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,560
on the Amazon, like, if we could kind of get this to work,

1639
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,400
right? Like, even if that were very cheap, and the best case

1640
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:11,560
where we solve this regulatory problem that so far, we were not

1641
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:14,640
able to solve. Now, that's not going to work in this kind of

1642
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,720
world, right? So, so, so that's, I think, something that's kind

1643
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:21,280
of contraindicated on this case, right? So it's kind of like, this

1644
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,120
will look worse. And similarly, if you kind of think about the

1645
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:29,200
structure of the world economy, like, and kind of like the future

1646
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,680
for predictions, you probably have like, more of the higher

1647
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,600
warming worlds are like, in situations where like emerging

1648
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:41,120
economies have been growing very strongly, right? So like, yeah,

1649
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:44,320
we're making us like, let's say Africa is kind of growing, and

1650
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,720
growing very strong. So it also tells us something about like,

1651
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:49,640
regional prioritization, some level,

1652
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,160
I think actually, that's, that's a great segue to where I would

1653
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:57,440
like to, to, to end this conversation by talking about

1654
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:02,120
kind of interactions between climates and, and other areas we

1655
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:06,080
could call them. What are the tradeoffs between economic

1656
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,520
development and emissions?

1657
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:13,040
Yeah, so that depends on where you are with regards to economic

1658
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:17,320
development. So there's a very strong relationship between

1659
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:21,720
economic development or human development more generally, and

1660
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,960
use of energy. And that's like, not like a one direction

1661
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,000
causation, right? So like, we shouldn't say like, more energy

1662
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,440
causes more development. But we should say that it would be very

1663
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,560
surprising that the world gets a lot richer without losing a lot

1664
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:39,000
more energy. So I think that's very clear. And like, there's

1665
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,760
papers on that that show this very clearly. And like, it's like

1666
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,880
kind of really, really strong kind of relationship. And the

1667
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,560
relationship is much, much stronger in the earlier part of

1668
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,560
the ladder, right? So like, high income countries right now are

1669
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,240
able to grow without growing their emissions, right? So there's

1670
01:35:56,240 --> 01:36:02,360
like, about 20, 25 countries or so that have been able to grow

1671
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,720
over the last decade, grow the GDP without growing their

1672
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,400
emissions, what would be kind of like the, the weak kind of

1673
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,600
condition of decoupling, right? It's kind of not doesn't mean

1674
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,640
they will meet their climate goals, but it kind of means that

1675
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,680
kind of growth is kind of possible without increasing

1676
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:22,360
emissions. But that is not true on the, on the lower end, right?

1677
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:26,360
And like, broadly for, for three reasons, if you're kind of

1678
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:30,680
very energy poor, then like, so if you can kind of save more

1679
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,560
energy, like energy efficiency gains, etc. will just use like

1680
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:37,600
probably translate into into more energy use. I think that's

1681
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,560
kind of one reason there's two other ones. So one is kind of

1682
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,560
like earlier economic development is kind of more, more

1683
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,120
carbon intensive, right? So it requires stuff like that

1684
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:49,440
requires little steel and cement, the kind of stuff that's

1685
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,760
kind of hard to decarbonize right now, or which we actually

1686
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,600
have not decarbonized to this point at like, reasonable cost.

1687
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:01,320
So that's kind of another aspect to this. Yeah, so that

1688
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:04,560
essentially you're doing lots of infrastructure investments

1689
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,320
that are very early. And of course, also like the willingness

1690
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:12,200
to pay for climate policy is like, very low and rightly so very

1691
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,960
low if you're not in a very energy poor context, right? If

1692
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,880
you're in India and have like 400 million people without

1693
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,600
access to electricity, then like the first thing that you're

1694
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,920
thinking about is not implementing a carbon tax.

1695
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,280
And so we mentioned one very large benefit of using less oil

1696
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,760
and coal, which is to add, which is a decrease in air

1697
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:36,760
pollution. Do you think there are other additional benefits?

1698
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:41,240
Here I'm thinking in terms of greater food stability or less

1699
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,360
conflict or something like that?

1700
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:47,400
I would call it the more sophisticated case about caring

1701
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,640
about climate change is probably less about like extreme

1702
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,040
weather events and the like the dire impacts of extreme weather

1703
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:57,480
events, but more like political instability and conflict,

1704
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,560
especially in places that are heavily dependent on like, well,

1705
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:04,120
environmental conditions, right, right? So if you kind of in

1706
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:07,240
sub-Saharan Africa, and you have like rain-fed agriculture,

1707
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,120
like that is probably the most likely case where you can get

1708
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:14,240
social destabilization because of climate change, because

1709
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:17,520
you're like the vulnerability is very high. So yeah, I think

1710
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,680
that's kind of an important effect. This seems like very

1711
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:25,480
important from like, like, ethically speaking, from a

1712
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,600
perspective of like, okay, this is like climate change is

1713
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,360
hurting the global poor the most. And like, it's kind of the

1714
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:36,560
most destabilizing probably in those in those areas. So I think

1715
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,000
that's a very important effect. And something that I think

1716
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,920
effective altruists, it's easy for effective altruists to forget

1717
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,160
that, because in a way, if you kind of think about climate as a

1718
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:51,280
civilizational risk, I think I would agree that the civilizational

1719
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:54,720
risk aspect of climate is kind of low, because it's kind of hard

1720
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:59,000
to imagine a great power war because of climate change. And I

1721
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,680
guess, like, if you're kind of caring about the long term

1722
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:03,200
future, like great power wars are just like, extraordinarily

1723
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:06,440
important. But kind of from the from the more near term suffering

1724
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,760
perspective, like, I think that's a very significant effect.

1725
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:16,920
And another one that comes more from essentially making clean

1726
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:20,360
energy cheap, right, is kind of thought like reducing energy

1727
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,040
poverty. So I just, I just mentioned, like, I guess 400

1728
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,800
million people in India, not having access to electricity,

1729
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,320
right? So like, we're living in a world where like, what we are

1730
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,120
thinking about first when we're reducing emissions, right, like

1731
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,960
we can use we can all use a lot less energy, without like,

1732
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,040
sacrificing a lot of our living standards. But we're not living

1733
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,240
in a globally representative part of the world. Both of us and I

1734
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,600
think most listeners. So it's kind of a very different

1735
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,240
situation, like the average human on this planet is like very

1736
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:55,000
energy poor and like, we're the human development benefits of

1737
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,760
access to more energy are very significant. Yeah, so and ideally

1738
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,760
if it's quite clean and cheap energy, that's the ideal, ideal

1739
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,200
case.

1740
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,560
Yeah, that's a great point. Your Highness, thanks for coming on

1741
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,320
the podcast. It's been a real pleasure. Thanks for sharing

1742
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,240
your knowledge with us.

1743
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,840
Yeah, thank you so much.

1744
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:13,640
Great to be here.
