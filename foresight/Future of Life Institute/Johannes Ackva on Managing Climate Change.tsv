0	3800	Welcome to the Future of Life Institute podcast. My name is
3800	8400	Gus Docker and I'm here with Johannes Aquar. Johannes is a
8900	12640	researcher at Founders Pledge where he leads the Climate
12640	15600	Change Fund. Johannes, welcome to the podcast.
15840	18280	Thanks so much for having me, Gus. Great to be here. I'm a big
18280	21520	fan of the Future of Life Institute. And yeah, happy to
21520	23040	talk all things climate today.
23400	26960	Perhaps we could start with your role at Founders Pledge. What
26960	29480	is it that you do there? How do you how do you see your role?
29600	34160	Yeah, so I think the way I usually describe it is like my
34160	39440	goal and the goal of my team is kind of to like find and fund
39440	42280	kind of the highest impact opportunities and climate and
42280	44760	those are like philanthropic opportunities, right? So like
44760	47960	things where we can wear a million dollars or something in
47960	50920	the quarter of magnitude can kind of make a difference by
50920	54920	supporting initiatives that are like extremely promising. And
54920	56720	yeah, as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning, right? So
56720	59440	there's kind of the climate fund, which kind of puts this
60440	62560	to life, the Founders Pledge Climate Fund, but also we're
62560	65880	advising kind of, I know for individuals kind of beyond that
65880	69120	and kind of trying to, yeah, trying to identify using
69120	71840	research and using privatization research, kind of to
71840	75320	identify where where are the biggest blind spot, what are the
75960	78600	blind spot generating mechanisms, if you will, and kind of
78640	82000	what does that mean for what you should fund on a margin as an
82000	82840	ex philanthropist?
83080	85920	Yeah, and I think that word is the key. So thinking on the
85960	89640	margin here, I see your job, or I think that that your job is
89640	92880	about thinking about the marginal dollar, where is that
92880	95640	dollar best spent? Would that be the correct frame?
95760	98880	Yes, the next dollar or the next million dollar. And I think
98880	102440	that's like really, really crucial frame, because I think a
102440	105760	lot of the things that I am going to be saying is going to be
105760	109920	like, controversial, and might be wrong. If like, if one would
109920	113040	interpret them as unlike, this is all we should be doing. And
113040	115120	that's, I'm not really talking about this is all we should be
115320	118520	doing. I'm talking about like, at the margin, this is what we
118520	121760	should be doing relatively, relatively more off. Yeah, we're
121760	126280	going to get into a broad overview of the whole climate
126280	128680	change issue. We're going to look at all the potential
128680	132720	technologies or government options that might help us
132760	136000	alleviate this problem. But I think we should start with your
136000	139800	personal journey as an environmentalist. So how did
139800	142360	you end up in this role? Where did you start? When did you
142360	144360	first become interested in the climate?
144560	149080	So, I mean, I grew up in the 90s in Germany, so it was very
149080	153040	easy to kind of become an environmentalist, I think. So
153080	155720	kind of in my, I remember, like some of my first childhood
155720	159040	memories kind of being very interested in saving the tigers
159040	163040	as like inventing a board game, save the Siberian tiger kind of
163040	166680	like, like, yeah, there was a, an animal documentary on like
166680	169560	three times a week and like the last five or 10 minutes of the
169560	172880	documentary would always be like, okay, and now humans are
172880	175840	destroying this beautiful nature, right? So that that was kind
175840	181280	of, I think, very big part of kind of, yeah, of this, of this,
181280	184480	I think, initial, initial education, or becoming an
184480	188160	environmentalist. And I guess I got more serious about this kind
188160	190760	of, yeah, in my, in my teenage years, when I was like an
190760	195120	environmental activist for the German chapter of Friends of
195120	198840	the Earth, and kind of like, protesting President Bush to
198840	201360	sign the Kyoto Protocol when he was visiting this kind of
201360	204200	stuff. So that's kind of where it started. And then I kind of
204200	207160	when I came to to university, I think the idea for me was, okay,
207160	210760	let's kind of study social sciences with a focus on like
210760	213720	understanding what's kind of what kind of makes climate
213720	217680	policies successful. So that's kind of what I spent kind of my
217680	221440	studies on. And then I was working afterwards, for, for a
221440	223920	think tank in Germany for five years, kind of working on
223920	227160	carbon pricing. And that's kind of, ultimately, after this kind
227160	230480	of joint joint foundry pledge kind of went into philanthropy.
230520	232400	So that's kind of the story.
232600	236640	Yeah. And what's something you've changed your mind about? Where
236680	240400	where have you gotten new ideas or learned new facts that kind
240400	241920	of changed your priorities?
242040	244840	I mean, lots, lots and lots over the years, right? So that was
244840	247440	kind of like a very short introduction to like a 20 year
247440	252200	journey. I think the first big change probably in college kind
252200	255080	of. So at that point, I was kind of, yeah, very strongly kind
255080	257480	of, yeah, as I said, like influenced by the environmental
257480	260720	movement kind of was kind of card carrying environmentalist,
260720	264440	if you will. And essentially, at that point, kind of, yeah, as I
264440	266600	said, I was kind of studying social science or kind of
266600	271440	focusing on political culture and understanding in a way that
271440	274760	like the things that I believed or the kind of people like me
274760	277120	would believe about how to solve the climate change, right? So
277120	280240	like, heavily focused on renewables, heavily focused on
280240	284120	energy efficiency, heavily focused on lifestyle change, being
284120	286960	anti nuclear being somewhat skeptical of technological
286960	289320	innovation, right? That essentially, all of those
289320	292240	beliefs kind of fit together kind of in a very systematic
292240	295920	fashion, right? And what unites them is not that they're kind
295920	298520	of an adequate response to the climate challenge, what unites
298520	301880	them is that they're kind of part of a specific ideology and this
301880	305280	kind of this case kind of like a kind of egalitarian green
305840	308080	ideology, which kind of is framing a large part of the
308080	311520	climate conversation. So I think that was kind of the first
311560	314600	really important realization that like all of all of the
314600	317360	responses to the climate and to other problems are kind of
317360	321080	heavily ideological shaped, right? And like, if you have a
321080	323380	situation like every other climate, which is kind of
323380	326440	dominated by one kind of ideology, this will kind of shape
326440	330840	the shape the results. So so I think that was kind of one, I
330840	334840	think another one a bit later, when I was studying in the in the
334840	340920	United States, this was like 2012, 2011, 2012. This was the
340920	344480	time where essentially in the US kind of the big push, the
344520	348800	big push under Obama to kind of push for climate policy. Waxman
348800	351840	Markey was the name. So that kind of a cap and trade bill in the
351840	355240	United States kind of had just failed, right? And this was like
355240	360040	a once in a generation moment with regards to climate policy in
360040	362000	the US, right? So like the Democrats had like won the
362000	365760	presidency had like a huge majority in the House and the
365880	369200	Senate as well, right? So like, was kind of a situation of
369200	371400	reckoning, like, what are we going to do now? Because like,
371440	374240	even even under such favorable conditions that we kind of can
374240	378000	expect every like 15 or 20 years, like, we're not able to pass
378000	382160	climate policy in the US. So I think in that time, kind of
383000	386120	discovered kind of I think what I would describe is kind of like
386120	389800	the innovation hawk argument in climate, right? So like people
389800	393480	that are like very heavily focused on innovation, which I
393480	397200	think at that time was kind of not that big a part of the of
397200	400640	the climate coalitions. I think that's kind of another thing
400640	404600	that changed around that time. And I don't think I go all the
404600	407720	way but it's kind of interesting. So because in a way, what they
407720	410560	did or what they were emphasizing kind of became a big part of
411080	413840	climate policy that later passed. So like that has just passed
413840	417280	with President Biden is kind of essentially putting this lots of
417280	420320	those ideas into practice. But so that's another one. And then I
420320	423760	think another kind of big one, of course, for me growing up as a
423760	427720	German environmentalist, I was heavily anti nuclear. And being
427720	430920	in the US also is the first time kind of exposed to pro nuclear
430920	435280	environmentalists. And for a time was kind of lukewarm about
435280	439000	nuclear and at some point kind of realized, okay, even though it's
439000	442480	very uncomfortable in the German context, because otherwise
442480	445480	reasonable people become like very unreasonable and very
445480	448520	emotionally aggressive, like, when you're talking about nuclear
448520	450760	and when they became pro nuclear, but that was kind of an
450760	455480	important shift of mind as well. I think those are kind of three.
456480	463280	And then two more recent ones, I would say, 2015, essentially a
463280	469600	success of the Paris Agreement. So up until 2015, I think
469640	473280	international climate policy by and large had always failed. And
473280	476520	this was kind of like, the expectations were very low. And
476520	479960	then the fact that the Paris Agreement kind of succeeded,
479960	482280	even though it's kind of a non binding agreement, but it can
482600	485840	has completely changed the conversations that we're having
485840	488680	in different countries. So it kind of serves as this kind of
490080	492840	North Star that kind of lots of national conversations that
492840	495920	kind of focused on. So I think that's kind of was another
495960	496600	surprise.
497160	500280	In what sense did the Paris Agreement succeed? What would
500280	501280	have been the results of it?
501400	505240	I mean, the Paris Agreement has succeeded. I mean, not only the
505240	507840	Paris Agreement, but like around that time. So like that was
507840	511920	in late 2015, and then like 2016, 2017, the nature of the
511920	514560	climate conversation has completely changed, right? Like
514560	517960	around that time in Western countries anyway, in the sense
517960	522200	that like before it was kind of a relatively niche issue, and
522200	525280	it kind of became like a broad societal consensus that like
525680	528560	meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement matters. I mean, it's
528560	531480	maybe not political consensus across the political aisle in
531480	534760	all countries, but at least kind of for the left, the central
534760	539160	left kind of in all countries. So I think that kind of really
539160	542560	changed and kind of the idea of net zero and that climate was
542560	547240	kind of a top issue. Yeah, so I think that's kind of I think
547560	550160	what the Paris Agreement achieved, right? And like, this is
550160	553520	kind of very significant, like compare it, right? It's like
553520	555920	it's a non-binding treaty, ultimately. So there is a
555920	560200	version, I think you could have had a cynical take on this
560200	563000	agreement kind of before, like it's not and I certainly had
563000	565360	this to a degree, like it's not going to do much because it's
565360	568760	like a non binding, very weak agreement on some level, that's
568760	572320	true. So that's not what it's doing, what it's doing, it's
572320	574720	kind of like transforming, conforming the conversation.
574960	578680	And you mentioned a last thing that you changed your mind on?
578920	583320	I think a last thing that I would mention is kind of that. I
583320	587120	think that's kind of maybe like 2020 or so. Essentially, that
587480	590720	the situation around climate has improved very, very
590720	593720	significantly, which is kind of funny to say this, because I
593720	596160	think most people have the have the opposite perception. But
596160	600640	like, in general, that like so like in 2015, 2016, people were
600640	605240	saying things like, there's a 5% probability of some of more of
605240	608800	six degrees, or more warming. And I think right now, if you
608800	612080	would make this forecast, the forecast right now would be
612080	615040	something like maybe like half a percent that we get to six
615040	617400	degrees at all, and not more than six degrees, like an order of
617400	623240	magnitude change. And so essentially, that the forecast
623240	626520	before we're probably with pessimistic, but also that the
626520	629800	situation kind of has has changed very significantly, mostly
629800	633200	through the success of renewables, the success of kind of
633240	637480	electric cars that essentially the the very high risk climate
637480	641640	futures are essentially almost ruled out at this point. And
641640	643480	that's a very significant change.
643760	646000	I'm wondering, when you're working with climate change,
646000	650880	this is such a complex issue. It's it's a it involves a lot of
650880	655600	disciplines, not just climate science itself, but economics
655600	660440	and law and the physics and engineering and all of these
660440	664440	disciplines, how do you form an all things considered view of
664440	667840	the situation in light of all of these disciplines? I mean, you
667840	672040	can't go get a PhD in all of them, I'm guessing. And so how do
672040	673920	you yeah, how do you how do you approach this?
674040	676440	I mean, in theory, you could but by the time you have those
676440	682640	PhDs, the problem was solved. Yeah, so I think the answer here,
682680	686080	I mean, has to be to kind of, essentially, you're always in
686080	689840	the state of like kind of being a reviewer and kind of like a
689840	692560	reviewer of different pieces of evidence. So that's like one
692560	695400	piece of the answer. Another piece of the answer is kind of
695400	698240	obviously, you do this on a team, right? So like, essentially,
698240	701720	right now, in my team, well, like we have a specialist kind of
701720	704160	for the technical economics, we have a specialist for Carmlock
704160	708440	and emerging economies, we have a specialist for philanthropy and
708440	710720	have other philanthropists behave. So that's kind of another
710720	713080	piece of the answer. But to, I think to answer it more
713080	716520	substantively, I think there's kind of like, three kinds of
716520	719880	expertise that are like most significant, when it comes to the
719880	722800	question of like, that I'm trying to answer, which is like,
722800	726160	what should we be doing philanthropically, right? So which
726160	730160	is kind of like only one way to answer the question of there,
730160	732880	I think it's kind of like one is kind of really the social
732880	736280	science question of like political visibility, like, which
736280	739520	kind of like carbon taxes, can we get where which kind of
739520	742640	policies can we achieve in a given country? So that's kind of
742640	746760	like, what does the option space actually look like? So that's
746760	749760	kind of, I think, one key expertise. The other one is kind
749760	752320	of like, what do different policies or different kind of
752320	754240	things in the world, what do they achieve, right? So like,
754240	757280	that's, I guess, policy analysis on econometrics and stuff like
757280	761160	that. And then there's kind of because climate change is really
761160	765080	a decadal challenge and the global challenge and like, it's
765080	767480	also a challenge of like, global technological transformation.
767480	771080	So then there's kind of this question of like, what do changes
771120	774120	and countries kind of what are the long term consequences of
774120	776720	that and kind of changing the technology stack, if you will,
776720	779040	globally, so it's a techno economic question. And I think
779040	784160	those three expertise was I kind of the most, most relevant
784160	788320	ones, from a, from a solution oriented perspective. And then
788320	790400	of course, if you're a philanthropist like myself,
790400	793480	then also like, what are other philanthropists doing, right?
793480	796880	Because like, doing the best thing on the margin is almost
796880	800880	always about kind of finding blind spots and filling the
800880	801560	blind spots.
802480	805960	Okay, so let's get to this broad overview that I would like of
805960	809000	climate change on the broadest possible scale. What is it that's
809040	814160	driving climate change? Is it mostly emissions? And if so,
814160	815760	where are these emissions coming from?
815800	820720	So it's like mostly mostly emissions, right? And so like all
820720	824960	of the mean all of climate change is about emissions. And so if
824960	827000	you kind of I mean, there's sort of different ways to slice it
827000	830320	by I guess, let's first kind of slice it by sector. So if you
830320	835160	kind of look at it by sector, then there's like 75% of
835160	840880	emissions are related to kind of energy and energy here like one
840880	843680	very important thing about climate electricity is only a small
843680	847160	part of energy electricity is about a third of energy. So like
847160	850080	when I say 75%, that's not only electricity, right? That's also
850080	853400	kind of transport fuels that's heating fuels and that's also
853400	856040	stuff like industrial heat. Essentially, the burning of
856040	861520	fossil fuels to produce energy. So that's about 75% of emissions.
862240	866560	Then there's about 5% of emissions that's kind of emissions
866560	870360	from industrial processes. So stuff like producing cement or
870360	872840	chemicals where you kind of have emissions that are not related
872840	876640	to fossil fuels that are called process emissions, right? And it
876640	879920	doesn't mean that industry is only 5%. This is about the kind of
879920	883880	the non energy share of industry. So that together gets you to
883880	888800	like about 80%. And then there's about 15 or like 18%. That's
888800	893320	kind of related to agricultural emissions, broadly. And then the
893320	897520	last 5% or so is kind of a combination of on the one hand,
897520	901640	stuff like deforestation, and then the other hand, stuff like
901640	906320	waste. So yeah, I think 80% of the challenge is kind of energy
906360	909760	energy industry. There's two important qualifications to
909760	914000	this. This is kind of where the emissions are coming from right
914000	917480	now, right? And like, that doesn't mean that this is exactly
917520	920320	proportional to what the solution looks like. So like, it can
920320	924120	definitely be the case of kind of land use change and kind of
924120	927080	like restoring wilderness, etc. It's like a bigger part of the
927640	930320	of the solution pipes. I think that's kind of one qualification.
931040	933960	And another qualification is that these percentages are kind
933960	939520	of heavily dependent on what warming metrics you use. So the
939520	942240	numbers that I cited right now are kind of for what's called
942240	945920	global warming potential 100. So like, if we're kind of assuming
945920	950400	over the course of 100 years, if you kind of take a shorter view,
950400	953200	if you would say something like global warming potential for the
953200	956560	next 20 years, then something like agriculture would have like a
956560	960440	larger share because methane, which is a very potent greenhouse
960440	962920	gas in the short term has kind of a relatively larger share in
962920	964960	agriculture than in other sectors. So that's another
965080	966640	important qualification here.
966760	971400	Yeah. And in global terms, our emissions still increasing?
971720	972200	Yes.
972760	976600	And how long do we expect them to increase?
976880	979040	Well, I mean, people have been talking about the end to
979040	982080	emission increase for a long time. And then there's always
982080	986640	something, something else coming up. So I think we will
986640	991280	probably see the end to increasing emissions this
991280	996760	decade. So I mean, it's mostly dependent on what China and India
996760	999960	are doing at this point. And they're both kind of, yeah, have
999960	1003400	to go to kind of peak their emissions rather soon. So it could
1003400	1005280	happen, could happen this decade.
1005320	1007520	Yeah, you mentioned China and India, we should talk about
1007880	1011360	geographically where emissions are coming from, where, where have
1011360	1013440	they come from in the past and where are they likely to come
1013440	1014280	from in the future?
1014480	1017440	Well, so I think in the past, right, if you kind of take the long
1017440	1020440	view, then, and that's like, most of the emissions are certainly
1020440	1023600	like have been caused by, by Western countries, I think
1023600	1027440	that's, that's kind of clear. And like, we do have being in
1027440	1032000	Western countries, like a large historical responsibility. But
1032000	1034640	if we kind of look at the situation right now, like the US
1034640	1038000	right now, something like 15% of emissions, the EU is something
1038000	1044440	around like 10%. And like Asia is kind of something like close
1044440	1048800	to two thirds of emissions and then kind of the rest. And if we
1048800	1051520	kind of think this picture going forward, right, so like the
1051520	1055280	share of the EU and the share of the US is going to kind of
1055280	1058600	further decrease, I mean, probably to something like for the
1058600	1063200	US to something like 5% for like the EU, maybe something like
1063200	1068080	3%. And then, yeah, China is going to be something like 25% I
1068080	1071280	think over over the course of the century, then other other
1071280	1074800	emerging Asia kind of India and then Southeast Asia. And then
1074800	1078120	kind of at some point later in the century, Africa, hopefully
1078120	1081760	will, hopefully will grow strongly and like, I mean, yeah,
1081800	1083840	let's hope it's going to be low carbon. But like, I guess
1083840	1087320	there's kind of this kind of also part of the long game. So
1087320	1091480	like the emissions are very clearly the focus of emissions
1091480	1094520	is very much changing, right? That's kind of what I sometimes
1094520	1097960	call like the central conundrum of climate policy, which is like
1098920	1102440	the people that are responsible for a lot of the historical
1102440	1107040	emissions kind of have very little direct leverage and kind of
1107040	1110280	how the problem is going to become because kind of
1110280	1113360	essentially, in the EU, like there's not a lot of emissions
1113360	1115440	you can reduce like I mean, anymore, right? Like I mean,
1115440	1119040	already kind of reaching the goal of getting to carbon
1119040	1122120	neutrality by 2050 is like very ambitious. But at that point,
1122120	1123880	like there's there's no leverage left.
1124080	1128320	Because you project that EU is only going to be 3% of emissions.
1128320	1132040	And so reducing emissions by 3% would be great, but it's not
1132040	1134440	going to tackle the problem in a big way.
1135200	1139040	Essentially, most of the leverage that the EU has on
1139040	1143080	emissions does not come from the own territorial emissions,
1143160	1145600	right? So if we kind of look at the most significant things
1145600	1149800	that EU countries have done, it's like things like Denmark
1149880	1152920	making wind energy cheap, Germany kind of making solar
1152920	1156920	cheap. These these kind of things have like done way way more
1156920	1161160	to like transform the energy future than like emission
1161160	1162120	changes within Europe.
1162200	1165360	European countries have subsidized technologies that can
1165360	1168440	then be exported to other countries where they can decrease
1168440	1171800	emissions much more than they could in those European countries
1171800	1174800	themselves. From what you're saying that the biggest problem
1174880	1178920	or the biggest driver of emissions is energy production. I
1178920	1182640	wonder if that category is too broad. I mean, a lot of things
1182640	1186560	must must be covered by energy production. Is it? What what
1186560	1187800	does that category cover?
1187960	1190360	Yeah, so like I think, yeah, I mean, it covers kind of
1191000	1195920	electricity, it covers heating, it covers transport, and it
1195960	1198360	also covers, I mean, that's also heating, but it's kind of
1198360	1200440	very different than what we mean when we say heating like
1200440	1203600	stuff like industrial heat, right, which like steel and stuff
1203600	1206680	like that. And like on some level, it's kind of true broader
1206680	1211080	term. I still find it useful to think about as kind of one
1211080	1213800	piece, because especially if we're thinking about the kind of
1213800	1217200	the solution trajectory, right? So like, what like, I guess the
1217200	1220280	master plan plan and so far as there is a master plan to kind
1220280	1225240	of solve climate, right? As essentially electrify everything
1225600	1228760	or like mean electrify all energy consumption, right? So that
1228760	1232000	sounds like, historically, those sectors have been very
1232000	1234880	different, but like, or kind of also very different in terms of
1234880	1238760	the fuels, but like, you want to get in a situation where like,
1238840	1242560	the central problem is one of kind of on the one hand getting
1243120	1247360	electricity or energy production kind of low or zero carbon. And
1247360	1249640	on the other hand, kind of either directly right with
1249640	1252880	electric cars or indirectly through stuff like hydrogen,
1253520	1256600	electrifying kind of a lot of other stuff. So in that sense,
1256600	1259920	it's a cross simplification to speak of like energy as one
1259920	1263640	sector, but it's also, I think, if we're kind of at the broad
1263640	1267560	level, it's a useful one in terms of, yeah, in terms of the
1267560	1268360	solution landscape.
1268400	1272440	Yeah, so so the categories is kind of unified by the same
1272440	1276720	solution, the same solution would solve all of the the the
1276720	1279400	things that belong to that category. So electrification
1279400	1283040	would be a solution for many of the things that belong to that
1283040	1284680	category. Or is that too strong?
1284840	1287080	I mean, it's just a little bit too strong. But I think it's
1287080	1291120	kind of right in the, yeah, basically right, I would say,
1291280	1294800	right. So, so how far electrification goes kind of
1294800	1297840	depends on like, like things are differentially easy to
1297840	1301200	electrify. So like, things that are hard to electrify stuff that
1301200	1305040	kind of requires, I mean, either a long duration of storage or
1305040	1308160	like lots of kind of concentrated energy, or so like
1308160	1310520	stuff like heavy duty transport, right, like electrifying
1310520	1313840	trucks is much harder than electrifying passenger cars. And
1313880	1317560	like, like refining large or like decarbonizing large ships,
1317600	1319760	it's kind of much harder and airplanes much harder than
1319760	1324040	cars. So, and for some of those, you might either use kind of
1324040	1326680	indirect electrification, right? So kind of like hydrogen or
1326680	1330800	like using power to create hydrogen. But it might also go
1330920	1334400	another way, you can also kind of create hydrogen kind of with
1334400	1338280	natural gas and carbon capture and storage. Yeah, so that's kind
1338280	1341960	of where there is more, more nuance there, where we can kind
1342280	1343240	of dive deeper.
1343280	1347720	Why is it more difficult to electrify an airplane than a car?
1347800	1350840	Is it is it because the airplane will have will have a need for
1350840	1353840	higher peak energy output or something like that?
1354000	1357720	Well, it's essentially, I mean, batteries are very heavy. And so
1357720	1360440	like an airplane becomes much more efficient, because once you
1360440	1364760	burn the fuel, it's kind of not, it has no weight anymore. And
1364760	1367400	it's also so like that's kind of one part. And like the other
1367400	1370400	part is kind of like energy, energy density, right? So like,
1370400	1372920	in principle, like flying and air, like flying kind of requires
1372920	1376080	a lot of, like, it's kind of much harder than kind of moving
1376120	1379360	moving a car around. And so you kind of need, need higher energy
1379360	1379880	density.
1380160	1383040	Okay, so what I want to do is to walk through all of the
1383040	1386960	potential technological options we have. Start with that. I'm
1386960	1390800	going to start with talking about oil and coal, which is kind
1390800	1394760	of a funny place to start maybe, because in some sense, oil and
1394760	1397760	coal is is the whole reason for the problem. But I think it's
1397760	1401440	interesting to discuss oil and coal just because if we know
1401440	1404160	something about why they are hard to replace, we might know
1404160	1408240	something about how to how to best go about the climate change
1408240	1413360	problem. So yeah, I've written down that that oil and coal is
1413360	1418040	cheap, and it works in existing systems. Do you see other
1418040	1420040	advantages beyond those I just mentioned?
1420840	1425800	Yeah, I think those are kind of the the two really big ones,
1425800	1428520	right? And like work in existing systems, I think another way to
1428520	1432640	put this is like, we've essentially built an entire world
1432640	1436480	economy around them. So they fit with existing systems, because
1436480	1438840	we built an entire economy around them and not only in the
1438840	1441640	economy, right? Like the United States is kind of having
1441640	1444120	aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, because kind of
1444120	1447080	protecting oil reserves is kind of part of the, well, it's like
1447080	1450400	part of the overall kind of strategy, right? So it's like,
1450720	1454280	yeah, essentially, we've been spending more than a century
1454280	1459480	optimizing our energy and world economy for relying on oil,
1459680	1463920	alcohol, natural gas, I think another kind of advantage that
1463920	1467280	they do have, I mean, at least if we compare them to renewables,
1468640	1472440	to most renewables is that they do have higher energy
1472440	1477520	densities. So yeah, and then of course, I mean, in the case of
1477520	1481200	oil, right, like oil is easy to transport, coal is also relatively
1481240	1485120	easy to transport with gas, it's a bit harder. Yeah, so I think
1485120	1488040	this is kind of like broadly speaking, that's that seems like
1488280	1489280	the right characterization.
1489480	1493080	And of course, the enormous disadvantage here is that there's
1493120	1498120	very high emissions associated with oil and coal. And I think
1498120	1501480	additionally, there are, there are quite large problems with
1501520	1504560	air pollution, which provides us with an additional reason to
1504560	1507480	replace oil and coal, maybe you could talk about air pollution
1507480	1510640	from from oil and coal. How big of a problem is that?
1510800	1515760	So air pollution at large kills about 7 million people every
1515760	1520920	year. So it's like one of the leading causes of death. And not
1520920	1523400	all of that is related to fossil fuels, right? So like, we also
1523400	1525960	have the situation that some of that is actually related to
1526480	1530560	renewables, like to, especially in Africa, people burning wood
1530560	1533800	for heating at home and for cooking. So that that's actually
1533800	1537080	a situation where like using a fossil fuel, in this case, natural
1537080	1539920	gas would actually be much better because it would. But
1539920	1545480	essentially, so, in particular, coal and oil, kind of, yeah,
1545520	1548360	yeah, kill kill a lot of people. So gas is a lot cleaner. So gas
1548360	1552920	is about 15 times cleaner than coal in terms of air pollution.
1553040	1556320	But it's a very significant cause of death. And I think it's
1556320	1560520	also really underappreciated. So like, people usually talk about
1560560	1564440	air pollution is kind of like a co benefit of climate change.
1564880	1568560	Unlike climate change has to get really bad to kill like 5
1568560	1571320	million people every year. Like, right? So like, it's kind of
1571320	1575200	quite possible that resolving climate change and like the most
1575200	1578200	significant effect of that is kind of a reduction in kind of
1578520	1581600	air pollution casualties, right? Obviously, like this is not the
1581600	1584800	highest risk case, right? Like there are cases with there's no
1584800	1587400	case with air pollution, like killing 100 million people, right?
1587400	1590320	And there's kind of cases, there's a risk cases around
1590320	1592840	climate that kind of motivate caring about climate that are
1593080	1596560	more extreme than killing 5 million people. But like, we would
1596560	1599560	yeah, it's just just I guess it's not it's not a co benefit.
1599560	1602320	It's kind of a problem on a similar order of magnitude.
1602440	1606480	Yeah, makes sense. Air pollution is a huge deal. Why is it that
1606520	1610720	oil and gas is hard to replace? And here we might talk about a
1610720	1614600	carbon lock in also, which is a term that that's used.
1614920	1618400	The primary reason that if like energy transitions are, well,
1618400	1620680	energy transitions are hard for a couple of reasons, right? But
1620680	1623240	like, okay, let's let's kind of start with that with a lock in
1623680	1628760	reason to begin with. A lot of the assets, right, like pipelines,
1629480	1633880	or coal power plants, or highways, etc. Right? Like those are
1633880	1636640	very long lived assets, right? They have natural lifetimes that
1636640	1641360	are like 40 or 60 years. They're capital intensive assets. So
1641360	1644880	like, even if like, you're kind of in a situation where like
1644920	1650280	every new build is kind of the low carbon alternative, it will
1650280	1653200	take you like 40 years to kind of turn around like an entire
1653200	1657520	system, right? And that's kind of an optimistic case. So like,
1657800	1660480	it's like, there's a lot of kind of lock in and then there's so
1660480	1663680	like, this is kind of at the pure kind of technical or
1663680	1666600	infrastructural level, right? And then you also have stuff like,
1667560	1669480	like pipelines and infrastructure, which are, which are
1669480	1673800	even, even longer, longer lived than single assets. And then of
1673800	1677120	course, you have like a huge kind of political economy, like
1677120	1680040	political special interest kind of groups and kind of the
1680040	1682920	entire kind of fate of countries essentially build around
1682920	1686480	that, right? I guess like when people say like, Putin used to
1686480	1691080	behave like the CEO of like a gas company, right? Like, I mean,
1691520	1694200	kind of changed a little bit the way he's behaving. But like,
1694200	1697480	right, like, it's kind of like, like their entire countries or
1697480	1699960	entire kind of regions of the world that are like heavily
1699960	1704040	dependent on the fossil fuel economy. So I think that's kind
1704040	1709360	of another really big reason. And another reason of like,
1709360	1713480	obviously, is also like energy transitions in general move
1713480	1716520	towards denser forms of energy, right? So like what we're trying
1716560	1720120	to do right now, where we're essentially saying, okay, we want
1720120	1725080	to move from a fossil fuel dominated energy economy to one
1725080	1728880	that's kind of dominated by renewables, kind of not a natural
1728880	1732840	direction for an energy transition to go. So like the more
1732840	1736080	natural direction of energy transitions thus far has been
1736080	1739880	like from less energy dense fuels of like from biomass to
1739880	1743680	fossil fuels, right? And like, going from fossil fuels to
1743720	1746800	mostly mostly renewable powered systems, actually, it's not a
1746800	1750520	natural move of the energy system, probably wouldn't happen.
1750840	1753120	Like there are many other situations where it kind of
1753120	1754080	wouldn't happen.
1754360	1758320	Yeah, maybe here is a natural point to talk about energy
1758320	1761440	density. Why is energy density important?
1762320	1765360	So energy density, right? So like, essentially how much land or
1765360	1768600	how many resources do you need to kind of produce a given amount
1769120	1772880	of energy? So the reason that's important, I think, is kind of
1772880	1778040	like, two fold mean from an environmental perspective, energy
1778040	1783040	density is essentially a proxy for like, how much impact we have
1783040	1785680	on the environment, right? So if you're using less land, using
1785680	1789280	less materials, then you're kind of like principle, like lower
1789280	1792360	energy density means like lower environmental impact. So that's
1792360	1796040	kind of one, one part of it. The other part, which is more about
1796040	1799160	like what's useful for for human civilization, right? So like
1799160	1802200	having denser forms of energy, like if you're talking about
1802200	1805160	electricity, it means like you need less transmission, for
1805160	1808280	example, right? So like that's kind of another use. And you're
1808280	1813680	also kind of, if you want to power, like an industrial center
1813680	1817640	or like an urbanizing society, like having lots of energy, and
1817640	1821640	having relatively dense forms of energy is useful. One shouldn't
1821640	1824440	overdo this, right? It's like, I'm not saying like, on the limit,
1824440	1827320	kind of, we would have like one big fusion plant and we all kind
1827320	1829760	of just get from. So that's clearly not the case. I think
1829760	1832840	we've seen this with nuclear fission that like, having very
1832840	1836040	large kind of energy sources also as a downside, because demand
1836040	1839840	isn't always there. So like, not take it to the extreme limit,
1839840	1842400	but like, kind of, on some level, like energy density and
1842400	1845520	principle is kind of useful, a useful metric.
1845560	1848360	But when you when you talk about energy density, it's you're
1848360	1851920	talking about also the resources necessary to produce that
1851920	1856280	energy, not only the energy density, say, for example, of a 10
1856280	1861800	centimeter by 10 centimeter cube of coal or oil or fuel for for a
1861800	1865040	nuclear reactor, it's a broader term than that. That's energy
1865040	1867880	density, where we have historically been moving towards
1867920	1870160	forms of energy that are that are more dense. And now we're
1870160	1873240	trying to move towards forms of energy that are that are less
1873240	1876240	dense. I think before we get to renewables, we should we should
1876240	1880040	talk about natural gas that you mentioned a couple of times. And
1880040	1884640	what are the advantages here and disadvantages? I'm guessing
1884640	1887320	it's it's better than oil and coal.
1887400	1889800	Just to add on the energy density, like because we've talked
1889800	1892560	about why it's important, but we didn't talk about what does it
1892560	1895840	actually look like. So like, if you're kind of if you look at
1895840	1898680	the metric site, nuclear nuclear power would be something like
1898680	1903560	seven terawatt hours per square kilometers, natural gas, which
1903560	1906600	we're going to talk about next, it's like about half that. And
1906600	1911880	like solar is kind of about 100 or so, roughly, what nuclear is
1911880	1914360	right. So that's kind of why it matters. Like the differences
1914360	1918040	are quite stark, both from from renewables to fossil fuels and
1918040	1922240	from fossil fuels to nuclear, like natural gas, if we talk about
1922240	1927560	natural gas. So I mean, it's about half as polluting as coal, in
1927560	1931840	terms of CO2. And it's much, much less polluting about 15
1931840	1934920	times less polluting when we talk about air pollution. And
1934960	1938480	essentially, if we look at the decarbonization successes of the
1938480	1942280	last 20 years, like many of them have been coal to gas
1942280	1944880	transitions. So like, essentially, the fact that the US was
1944880	1948680	kind of able to reduce emissions, even though until like 2021
1948680	1951280	didn't really have much in terms of climate policies, like,
1951640	1954400	mostly the story of the fracking revolution in the United
1954400	1957680	States, and kind of the replacement of coal by natural
1957680	1961200	gas, a little bit similar in the UK, in the UK, there's kind of
1961240	1964760	natural gas is also like more of a renewable expansion. And
1964760	1967280	that's so like, that's kind of another select that's kind of
1967280	1970920	this has been a big story. It's like an easy win, right? It's
1970920	1973120	not a transformational win because you don't get to zero
1973120	1976520	emissions. But it's kind of the easy win. So if you're imposing
1976560	1980520	moderate carbon price, in a place with a lot of coal, that
1980520	1983240	will usually mean you're gonna substitute it with natural gas.
1983320	1986400	In which cases does it make sense to switch to natural gas?
1986600	1988520	I mean, that's kind of like, right, that that's kind of I
1988520	1990640	think something where the climate community has like two
1990640	1992680	different perspectives, right? I think there are people that
1992680	1995920	are more incrementalists that would say like, yeah, it's good
1995920	1998920	if you're switching from coal to natural gas. There's also
1998920	2000920	people that would say, okay, if you're switching from coal to
2000920	2004720	natural gas, you're locking in another fossil fuel source, right?
2004720	2008040	And it's kind of like better to maybe have coal run a bit
2008040	2011520	longer and then fully replace it with a zero carbon source. I
2011520	2014320	think that's kind of the debate. And I think different people
2014320	2016640	have like different opinions. And I think also the right answer
2016640	2019560	might be different in different places. The best case scenario
2019600	2023680	would be one for like, natural gas replaced with coal. And then
2024200	2027160	natural gas is kind of replaced with natural gas and gas and
2027160	2030760	carbon capture. So where you're kind of capping the emissions
2030760	2033120	or where you're using kind of part of the natural gas
2033120	2037200	infrastructure with like zero carbon fuels, right? So like
2037200	2041920	with natural gas kind of that's produced for electrolysis and
2041920	2044960	kind of like additional like adding CO2 there or yeah, so
2044960	2047800	it's a synthetic natural gas, essentially.
2047960	2051600	So that last point, is there a way to produce that natural gas
2051600	2053320	that's more environmentally friendly?
2053480	2058000	So I mean, natural gas is CH4. So in principle, you can, you
2058000	2062440	can get it from H2 like from hydrogen, like which you can
2062440	2065080	generate in a low carbon way. And if you would kind of then
2065080	2067760	take CO2 out of the air, so you can essentially produce like
2067760	2072240	carbon neutral, natural gas, right? Like this. Yeah, or you
2072240	2077760	could use hydrogen. Yeah. So essentially, there's ideas of
2077760	2082080	about using some of the kind of natural gas infrastructure for
2082080	2085440	like zero carbon gases. And that's I think something like one
2085440	2089360	way where carbon lock in can be made a little bit less severe,
2089360	2091880	right? Where you're like locking in like a gas infrastructure,
2091880	2095080	for example, but that gas could at some point be carbon neutral.
2095200	2099640	Yeah, if we build a new natural gas plant now, how much carbon
2099640	2102880	are we locking in? For how many years would this natural gas
2102880	2106480	plant have to run in order to be profitable or to make sense to
2106480	2109320	build? If you're building new natural gas plants right now, I
2109320	2111680	think they expect like most like if you're in a Western
2111680	2114200	country, I don't think the investor would have the
2114200	2117880	expectation that they're going to run this for 40 years, because
2117880	2121480	like running this for 40 years would mean they're not 2023. So
2121480	2125640	like 13 years after kind of most Western countries have
2125640	2129120	committed to like reaching net zero. That being sad, right?
2129120	2132280	Like even countries like Germany, that are kind of
2132320	2135240	priding themselves to be climate leaders are building new
2135240	2141200	natural gas capacity right now in an energy crisis situation,
2141200	2144040	right? So we're essentially, I guess the way this becomes
2144040	2147280	profitable is because we really do value energy security. So
2147280	2151160	like, as countries, we're willing to kind of finance
2151160	2155120	things that don't make sense in a long run perspective, if you
2155120	2155400	will.
2155800	2159080	Maybe we could say a bit more about energy density and why
2159080	2162920	it's important. Is it important because some forms of energy
2162960	2166920	take up too much space and then crowd out other other things
2166920	2169240	we would like to do with that space like having natural
2169240	2174400	habitats or yet using the land for agriculture or what's the
2174400	2177640	problem with energy sources with low energy density?
2177760	2182720	So like crowding out of like other land uses is definitely a
2182720	2186320	factor, right? So especially for biofuels, I think it's a
2186320	2190080	factor with like biofuels take up a lot of land and like kind of
2190080	2192800	agricultural land that that can compete with like food
2192800	2198000	security concerns. Yes, I think that is kind of one concern. So
2198000	2200560	like land use, right? So like if I looked at a paper where
2200560	2203920	essentially that's kind of modeling a transition towards a
2203920	2207280	lower carbon future and what they're essentially like, and like
2207280	2210680	a renewable heavy future, what they're essentially modeling is
2210680	2217440	like, okay, by 2050, there is some six fold increase in the land
2217440	2221200	required required for energy production compared to today. And
2221200	2223520	like to be fair, like it's not that it's six times less
2223520	2226520	efficient, because also like electricity production is like
2226520	2228960	assumed to triple over the time frame rate. So that's kind of a
2228960	2232440	halving of like efficiency in terms of like energy density,
2232440	2237240	that's like a still a significant change. I think to me, the
2237240	2241200	more the more fundamental challenge is really one of like, if
2241200	2243440	you're having lots of decentralized energy sources,
2243440	2246120	like kind of the requirements in terms of transmission and like
2246120	2249640	infrastructure, build out are kind of like much, much larger,
2249680	2253640	right? So essentially, when we're saying it is cheap, and it is
2253640	2256320	easy to build renewables, we're talking about is kind of on the
2256320	2259680	plant level where this is true. But when we're talking about the
2259680	2262520	energy system level and say like we want to build an energy
2262520	2267320	system that is primarily based on low energy density sources,
2267920	2270360	like I'm not saying this cannot work, but like this is like a
2270360	2274560	risky proposition, mostly for the for transmission and storage
2275280	2280000	requirements that are kind of related to low energy density
2280440	2281440	and intermittency.
2281560	2286840	Okay, so that's oil, coal and natural gas. What about if we if
2286840	2291240	we get into the renewables, so solar and wind? What are some
2291240	2293320	advantages of solar and wind?
2293800	2297160	At this point, solar and wind are pretty cheap. So at this point,
2297160	2299880	I think in many, in many places in the world will be the case
2299880	2303080	that like adding solar capacity to the grid is like one of the
2303080	2306840	cheapest things you can do. It's very important to realize
2306880	2311800	that like this is not a fact of like nature or like technology
2311800	2315280	itself, that's a result of like very conscious social choices,
2315280	2318120	right? I mean, it's essentially countries like Germany and
2318120	2321240	jurisdictions like California, and then later kind of China,
2321960	2324240	essentially saying, okay, we really want to have cheap
2324240	2326840	renewables, and we're really like heavily investing that. So in
2326840	2328920	that sense, kind of the fact that we have cheap renewables
2328920	2333440	right now is much more a function of their popularity
2333480	2336640	with constituencies than it is kind of like the principle
2337120	2340160	underlying technology, right? So like, if like nuclear would be
2340160	2343120	as popular as like renewables are, we probably also could have
2343120	2346640	like cheap nuclear now, this is kind of what I'm saying, or a
2346640	2349920	geothermal for that matter. So I think that's kind of an
2349920	2353600	important aspect here. So yeah, there can be quite cheap. And
2353600	2356800	also there are use cases where decentralized and kind of
2356800	2359640	smaller production is kind of good, right? So I mean, you can
2359640	2364840	kind of use deploy them where they are needed, right? Like if
2364840	2367880	you're, if you're a small town, you're not going to build your
2367880	2370960	own kind of big power plant, but you can build your, but your
2370960	2374640	solar's on the rooftop, etc. So I think that's kind of the main
2374880	2379120	advantage obviously produces no carbon, no air pollution. Yeah,
2379280	2382160	and can be can be built quickly.
2382240	2385280	Yeah, so you mentioned that that solar and wind have gotten
2385280	2389120	cheaper because of basically policies by European countries
2389120	2392320	and by California and so on. When when solar has reached the
2392320	2395840	price point that it has that it that it's at now, does it
2395840	2400080	require kind of continual subsidies to stay at that price
2400080	2403640	point? Or have we developed solar to a point now that it's
2403760	2407560	price competitive, even on an open market, let's say. So in
2407560	2410360	energy, you generally don't have open markets. I think that's an
2410400	2415840	important thing to realize. So solar is competitive in many
2415840	2419120	cases, right? But like, it's not like with oil, we're like, you
2419120	2422720	have a global price of oil, right? It's like, essentially, for
2422720	2425600	solar, like how costs affect on the solar, compared to
2425600	2428720	alternatives depends on like, how good is the solar resource?
2429320	2432120	Depends also on like, how much solar is already on the grid?
2432120	2434880	Because like, you can be in a situation where like installing
2435520	2439280	the additional solar capacity is very cheap, but it's not going
2439280	2442560	to produce a lot of additional value because essentially, like
2442560	2445280	the sun is shining at the time where you're already at 100%
2445440	2449080	solar, then like, it's easy to add an additional solar power
2449080	2452200	plant, that's kind of it doesn't add a lot. Unless you kind of
2452200	2455400	have cheap storage or cheap transmission, super cheap, sorry,
2455400	2458600	super cheap transmission. So that's what's called value
2458640	2461000	deflation. So it's not really like, it doesn't really make
2461000	2465200	sense to think about it as like, one price point that that is
2465200	2468400	being, being undercut, right? So like, we're in a situation
2468400	2471920	where there are places in the world where like, adding solar
2471920	2474400	kind of happens without subsidies, and it's kind of like,
2474400	2478200	essentially, the natural result of like market forces or like
2478200	2482080	mediated market forces. And we have also places with quite a
2482080	2484200	very high renewable penetration, right, places like
2484200	2487600	California, or Germany, where like, places that made renewables
2487600	2490440	so cheap, but that are now kind of struggling to add a lot more
2490440	2493880	because stuff like system integration, or like the value
2493880	2497360	of an additional plant is kind of, is kind of low.
2497400	2501120	How much of our energy production could be replaced by wind and
2501120	2504880	solar alone? The problem with wind and solar, or one problem is
2504880	2509760	that it's intermittent. So it requires the sun to shine or the
2509760	2515080	wind to blow, unless you have a really good storage technology,
2515080	2519400	basically, batteries. But how much of our energy production do
2519400	2521800	you think we could replace by by solar and wind?
2522120	2524560	You don't only need batteries, right? So like, essentially, you
2524560	2529400	need to solve, I think, three or four problems. So like, one is
2529400	2533320	kind of short term storage. For this, you can use batteries.
2534200	2537520	And right, that's kind of like, okay, you can run your washing
2537520	2540720	machine during the night, that that's kind of the use case.
2541160	2543880	Then you kind of need to solve in most places in the world, you
2543880	2546520	need to solve seasonal storage, right, so that there's kind of
2546520	2548680	like parts of the year where like, there's much less solar
2548680	2552040	available. Like, that's like a much, much harder challenge. And
2552040	2554040	I think that's kind of underappreciated, because people
2554040	2556080	talk about storage, they think about batteries, and they think
2556080	2559800	the problem was solved. And like, kind of essentially, being
2559800	2563640	able to have enough energy to like half a month, or like more
2563640	2567240	kind of work of like energy reserve requires a very different
2567600	2569840	solution. It's not probably not going to happen with batteries,
2569840	2572640	that's kind of for something like, right, what I've talked about
2572640	2575960	before, like, power to x, like producing hydrogen or kind of
2575960	2581360	other forms of like, low carbon energy, like gases or like
2581440	2584680	liquid to store energy. So like, that's kind of what you will
2584680	2586760	need there. And then there's kind of the problem of
2586760	2591880	transmission. And then there's a problem around essentially, do
2591880	2596600	we have enough land in the jurisdictions? I think the last
2596600	2599040	one will not be the decisive constraint, I think that that
2599040	2602280	will will probably work. But essentially, there's like, three,
2602600	2605480	three challenges, like storage in the short term, seasonal
2605480	2609120	storage, transmission, I can't imagine the world, right, if
2609160	2612000	when I think about the future, I always try to think of a
2612000	2614840	distribution. And like, there's like part of that
2614840	2619800	distribution where like, okay, wind and solar are kind of
2619800	2625160	really like 80 or 90% of the energy supply. And essentially,
2625160	2628040	seasonal storage has been solved, transmission has been
2628040	2630360	solved, and it's kind of that that's a large part of the
2630360	2633920	solution. Those are not the futures I'm particularly worried
2633920	2637680	about. Because I mean, those are really very best case futures,
2637680	2641120	it's like an AI safety of like AGI is inherently safe, that's
2641120	2645000	kind of the future. And then there are kind of the futures
2645000	2648280	where like, something has gone wrong, right? And like, that's
2648280	2651960	kind of like an hour climate response and like a natural thing
2651960	2655080	or things like one of the most likely failure modes right now
2655080	2657600	that we can like, if we kind of if we're kind of waking up in
2657600	2660880	2040, and like, we're on a trajectory to like, more than
2660920	2663920	three degrees, it's very likely that kind of, we've been
2663920	2667120	overbeating on intermittent renewables, that essentially,
2667240	2670320	that it is much harder, even though it's easy to get to like
2670320	2673880	20, 30% in electricity, like getting to like 100% in energy
2673880	2676600	right again, like, and then like, growing demand, like
2676600	2679720	something like 10x compared now that this is kind of really
2679720	2682240	hard. So this is an area where there's very significant
2683280	2686360	uncertainty, I would say we're kind of, yeah, on the top, you
2686360	2690520	can kind of do almost get almost 100%, but also where it's kind
2690560	2694400	of quite imaginable that you don't get over, over 50% of
2694400	2697600	energy, which will still be like a huge, huge role, right? I
2697600	2699760	mean, right now, it's kind of something like three to 4% of
2699760	2703160	like energy. You mentioned the seasonal storage, what are the
2703160	2706360	most promising approaches there? This is something where it's
2706360	2709680	not primarily about batteries, right? So it's primarily about
2709680	2713760	kind of using more energy dense form. So like, for example,
2713760	2717080	using using kind of excess capacity, excess power
2717120	2720680	capacity, to produce carbon neutral hydrogen and to store
2720680	2723120	this as hydrogen or to kind of store this like synthetic
2723120	2727480	natural gas. This to me seems right now, the most plausible
2727520	2729840	trajectory. I mean, there's also kind of like, there's, there's
2729840	2732520	lots of different technologies that are being tried out.
2732680	2737400	Okay, so that's, that's solar and wind, which could turn out
2737400	2741200	very, very well. But where there are challenges to be solved
2741200	2744160	before they can be implemented and can constitute a large
2744200	2746120	percentage of our energy production.
2746520	2750480	That sounds too pessimistic. It's more like, solar and wind
2750480	2753160	will definitely play a much larger role than they're playing
2753160	2757680	now. The question is, will they take us to 100% but like, yeah,
2757680	2759840	that's a different, yeah, it's a different framing, right? So
2759840	2762840	like, yeah, the short term story is definitely about the
2762840	2765120	expansion of, of mature renewables.
2765160	2769640	We should say something about the, to my eyes, insane decrease
2769640	2773960	in the price of solar, or at least it looks like a very,
2773960	2777480	very steep decrease when I look at these graphs. Yeah, can you
2777480	2780840	say something about how much cheaper solar is now compared to
2780840	2781720	20 years ago?
2782120	2784960	Well, it's essentially at like less than 10% of where it was
2784960	2789080	20 years ago, right? So like, that's, that isn't an insane
2789080	2791880	decrease. So I like, I remember when I was kind of entering the
2791880	2795200	climate conversation, and people were talking about renewables,
2795200	2799040	they were always talking about solar wind, geothermal, hydro,
2799040	2802080	bio, at some point, people only started talking about solar and
2802080	2804680	wind, right? Because essentially, those technologies
2804680	2808440	could like radically cheaper, in particular, solar wind also,
2808440	2813000	but a bit less so. Yeah, so that's a very, very steep decline,
2813040	2816800	right, which has been achieved. There's a great book about this
2816800	2821240	how solar got cheap by Gregory Named, but essentially, it's
2821240	2825360	kind of primarily a result kind of very aggressive policy. I
2825360	2828920	mean, it kind of goes back to the 1970s and like, the first
2828920	2832280	oil crises from like Jimmy Carter, but then kind of got really
2832280	2835160	picked up in the early 2000s, right, of like Germany, kind of
2835160	2837720	really strongly supporting it, also like not only Germany, also
2837720	2841280	like California, etc. And then like, at some point, China
2841280	2845360	essentially massively investing in production capacity. So yeah,
2845360	2849920	and that's kind of a big part of the story as well. It's not a
2849920	2852720	story of fundamental technological innovation. It's
2852720	2857560	really more of a brute force approach to making things cheap.
2858000	2862360	What about Hydro? Could Hydro ever constitute a large percent
2862400	2864000	of our energy production?
2864120	2867200	So Hydro could, I think, I mean, it's like, it's already, I
2867200	2869560	think it's still, if I'm not mistaken, it's still like the
2869560	2873240	largest renewable energy resource, right? It's kind of, it's
2873240	2876240	not really talked about because it's kind of like, static, it's
2876240	2879040	not like the, it's not sexy, it's not where the action is. But
2879040	2882680	like, it's a very significant part. I think like with Hydro,
2882680	2885720	like large Hydro has like large kind of environmental
2885760	2888960	downsides. And I think another kind of constrained, like, so
2888960	2890920	that's a couple of other constraints. And one is like
2890920	2894400	geopolitical. If you're kind of talking about them, hydropower
2894400	2897040	is often like a very kind of contentious issue if you're
2897040	2901000	thinking about denial or other other areas. So like, that's
2901120	2907080	another big problem. And it's also like very long term
2907080	2909600	infrastructure. So I think like, Hydro, I think, like from a
2909600	2912240	technical perspective, like Hydro could play a larger role,
2912240	2915080	but it's kind of, I don't think there are many people that are
2915080	2917720	kind of betting on like an abundant future with lots of
2917720	2921560	Hydro. Or at least I haven't come across them. I think I know
2921560	2926800	exactly like one charity that's working on hydropower. That's
2926800	2929800	mostly on making less clear paths. And the answer, they're
2929800	2932360	kind of trying mostly to use hydropower, making existing
2932360	2937160	hydropower or existing dams more efficient, like essentially
2937160	2938840	using them more to produce electricity.
2939080	2944200	Do we even have enough large rivers to, to generate enough
2944280	2945680	electricity by Hydro?
2945880	2948440	That's a good question. But I actually don't know the answer
2948440	2952360	because it's kind of so far out of the overturned window. One
2952360	2955520	other thing I want to say on Hydros that essentially Hydro is
2955520	2958240	affected by climate change as well, right? So like, essentially
2958240	2962240	that Hydro is becoming a less reliable energy resource,
2962280	2964960	essentially, as kind of climate patterns, precipitation
2964960	2968120	patterns become harder to predict and more extreme. So I
2968120	2970920	think it's kind of another reason why it's not like, it's not a
2970920	2974000	major bet that anyone I think is kind of really making at this
2974000	2978560	point. Okay, let's move on to nuclear energy. What do you see
2978560	2981320	as the advantages and disadvantages there?
2981600	2984040	Hey, like the biggest advantage is like related to energy
2984040	2987520	density, right? I mean, it sounds like ironic and very
2987520	2989920	counterintuitive to say this, but like from an environmental
2989920	2992720	perspective, like nuclear is kind of the cleanest, cleanest
2992720	2996040	form of energy production. Because it's like of those that we
2996040	2999000	have right now, because it's so, so energy dense, it doesn't need
2999000	3001320	a lot of materials, it doesn't need a lot of land. Yeah, so
3001320	3005120	I think that's kind of the clear advantage produces zero
3005120	3009920	carbon disadvantages, I think are are well known in the case of
3009920	3015880	nuclear. So accident risk, nuclear waste. Yeah, and also I
3015880	3019760	guess some dual use concerns around like nuclear weapons. Yes,
3019760	3023360	I think those are kind of the disadvantages and also right
3023360	3025200	now, but that's not a fundamental feature of
3025200	3027600	technology. That's kind of something of, I guess it's a
3027600	3031040	result of social choice. Right now, it's very expensive and
3031080	3033760	slow to build. Yeah, that was actually my my next question
3033760	3037800	would be, when I look at some new nuclear power plant, it has
3037800	3041800	often taken a decade or more to build. And it's gone over
3041800	3045800	budget. So so why is it so? Why does it take so long? And why
3045800	3048680	does it cost so much to build nuclear power plants?
3049200	3052000	Like I think right now, I mean, we were able to build nuclear
3052000	3054240	power plants in France and something like four years,
3054240	3057160	right? And right now, we're not able to do this in the West
3057160	3059440	right now, it would probably more take something like 20 years.
3059440	3064920	But so there's a lot of variance here that is like, it's not
3064920	3067720	like related to the features of the technology or like our
3067720	3070640	fundamental technological ability, right? There's like a 5x
3070640	3074800	kind of difference that's kind of related to regulation,
3074800	3078200	economy, societal commitment, etc. Right? That's kind of where
3078600	3082480	where the explanation ultimately has to be. So I think
3082480	3085320	there's kind of lots of different reasons. I mean, one,
3085360	3088520	like, I guess, one most general one, which is not nuclear
3088560	3090760	specific is like in general, in the West, we're not able to
3090760	3092720	build things, right? It's not only that we're not able to build
3092720	3095720	nuclear plants, we're also not in Berlin, we're not even able to
3095720	3099760	build airports. So, so I think that's kind of like the general
3099760	3102280	class of like, there's lots of general stuff around like
3102280	3105120	regulation and kind of interest groups. But then there's also
3105120	3107920	like nuclear specific stuff, right? And I think it's
3107920	3111160	essentially, I think the most significant part is that
3111160	3114680	essentially the supply chain for for building nuclear in the
3114680	3117080	West has essentially fallen fallen apart, right? So like,
3117600	3122480	we're building things kind of in the first of a kind style, or
3122480	3125360	kind of not first of a kind, but like first in a decade or first
3125360	3128440	in a decade more, which is not the way to build like anything
3128440	3131640	kind of at scale anything efficiently. That's not how France
3131640	3134080	kind of built the nuclear fleet, right? So like, the most
3134560	3137920	successful example of building out nuclear quickly is like
3137920	3143520	France from the like late 70s to like late 80s. So that's, I
3143560	3149520	think, most of the explanation. What did France do right? I mean,
3149520	3153640	France was in a situation of emergency. So like the 1970s at
3153640	3157880	the time of like the big oil price shocks and like France is a
3157880	3164080	country without significant domestic energy supply. So they
3164080	3168880	were extremely exposed to the oil price shocks. And at the same
3168880	3171200	time, they were already in nuclear power, right? Like they
3171200	3173760	kind of have like nuclear expertise, very centralized
3173760	3177280	government. So yeah, they essentially decided, okay,
3177280	3180200	we're gonna build nuclear as like a national project, and that
3180200	3183680	kind of standardized it like one of like, both the same kind of
3183680	3188200	reactor, both the workforce in a very centralized fashion, if
3188200	3191680	you kind of compare this to the US, for example, where like
3191680	3194720	utilities are kind of really spread out across the country,
3194720	3199120	and like we're like, essentially, there's like not
3199120	3201600	someone who's buying like 100 nuclear plants, right? There's
3201600	3205840	kind of utilities that are buying like one reactor, or maybe
3205840	3208160	two reactors and one plant or something like that, right? So
3208160	3211320	like, the way that this happens was like fundamentally,
3211760	3214040	fundamentally different. So these were very special
3214520	3217520	circumstances. And like, just to be very clear, I'm not
3217520	3220680	suggesting that those are transferable to today, right? Like
3220680	3224120	it's not that the kind of shock or stress that France was under,
3224120	3226960	it's not something we can replicate and say, oh, we're all
3227000	3230440	we're all gonna build like to 80% nuclear in like 15 years,
3230880	3233280	because of climate change, most countries are not able to do
3233280	3236080	that. Like, technologically, they are, but like politically
3236080	3238480	speaking, it doesn't seem feasible.
3238920	3243600	Do you think we we need to develop new designs for nuclear
3243600	3249240	reactors? Do we need to move to better designs? Do we need a
3249240	3253120	molten salt reactors or something like this? Or are the
3253120	3255120	reactor designs we have today enough?
3255320	3258120	And this is, I think, an active debate in the like, in the
3258120	3262640	nuclear community. And I think like, it kind of depends on how
3262680	3266320	how do we define need in this context, right? So like, I
3266320	3269080	think, from purely technical perspective, right, there's
3269080	3274640	nothing wrong with existing nuclear power plants. So what's
3274640	3276720	wrong is kind of like when the fact that we're not able to
3276720	3279840	build them is kind of lack of societal commitment and like,
3280640	3282640	lack of learning and stuff like that, right? So like, we can
3282680	3286600	imagine a future where we built a lot of that. So the question
3286600	3291200	is, can we actually get into that future? The most significant
3291200	3293760	benefit of kind of advanced nuclear, like small, small
3293760	3299080	modular reactors is essentially, it seems more plausible that
3299080	3301800	this is kind of like, like, or there are countries where it
3301800	3304280	seems more plausible that we're going to build lots of small
3304280	3308120	modular reactors, because you can produce them and factories,
3308120	3311360	you can essentially exploit the same learning curve dynamics
3311400	3313920	that made renewables and electric cars and all other kind of
3313920	3316960	technologies that we were able to make cheap cheap. So that's
3316960	3320760	kind of another aspect. And it's also kind of playing much
3320760	3324240	better with like renewable dominated grid. So it's kind of
3324240	3327520	more flexible. And it's also like a smaller, smaller unit. So I
3327520	3331640	think there, yeah, I think, I mean, we are like philanthropically
3331640	3334400	speaking, we are we are betting on advanced nuclear or small
3334400	3337920	modular reactors. But I wouldn't say it's necessarily related
3337960	3341840	to like, technological problem with existing reactors is more
3341840	3345280	like, yeah, the whole, yeah, yes, one of the themes here, it's
3345280	3348680	not only about technology, it's about the whole like, societal
3348680	3351160	kind of apparatus around the technology.
3351280	3354360	And so the small modular reactors would be easier to
3354360	3357320	innovate on because you would you would be able to develop one
3357320	3360760	such reactor and deploy it and get feedback much, much more
3360760	3364720	quickly than you can with a with a larger reactor, where it might
3364720	3369280	take 15 years for it to to be built. And only then can you go
3369280	3372680	back and think about what you could have done differently. Is
3372680	3375360	it also a question of potentially you can you can mass
3375360	3378000	produce these small modular reactors? What are the
3378000	3378840	advantages here?
3378960	3381520	So like it is the mass production, right, the mass
3381520	3385160	production in a factory. So it's not only the 15 year thing,
3385160	3387200	right, like under ideal circumstances, you could also
3387200	3389360	build a large plant and something like four or six years,
3389360	3392000	like you could also learn something from large plants,
3392000	3395720	and you could build the same plant design over and over
3395720	3399800	again. But it's much easier to learn. And like, obviously, it's
3399800	3402920	like a controlled production environment, right? So like when
3402920	3405160	kind of most of the reduction happens in a factory, I mean,
3405440	3408040	obviously, some of the assembly has to happen on site, but like,
3408520	3412160	that is where you can really kind of expect a high learning
3412160	3415600	rates, right? So that's kind of, yeah, essentially, applying the
3415600	3419360	same mechanism by which we make, make other kind of
3419360	3422840	technologies cheap to the nuclear case.
3423440	3427680	One last technology I want to run through is geothermal. This is
3427680	3431120	something that's maybe like hydro, it's potentially a bit
3431120	3435880	overlooked. But yeah, how promising do you think geothermal
3435880	3436520	energy is?
3436760	3439880	So I would say much more promising than hydro. But I think
3439880	3442920	also, geopharmals definitely having a moment right now, and
3442920	3445520	it's becoming radically less overlooked. There's traditional
3445520	3448800	geothermal, which is kind of great, but it's very location
3448800	3451520	specific, right? So you're low location dependent, you kind of
3451520	3453800	do it, build it in lots of places, because you kind of need
3454520	3456720	essentially not, yeah, you need kind of good conditions, you
3456720	3460920	need like, yeah, close to volcano, etc. So like, essentially,
3460920	3464520	you need to be closer to heat source near in the ground. And
3464520	3468000	then there's kind of like different forms of like advanced
3468080	3471600	geothermal. And that's a little bit like, there's like lots of
3471600	3475360	different ones, it's like six or seven different ones. But I
3475360	3478240	guess the one that we've been focusing on traditionally is
3478240	3481600	what you would call ultra deep geothermal or like a super
3481600	3484800	hot rock geothermal, where essentially, you're going so
3484800	3488640	deep, that you can kind of make it much less location
3488640	3491880	dependent, and also kind of get much, much warmer, what much
3491880	3495320	hotter fuel, so you kind of get more, more energy density to
3495320	3498040	get more favorable economics. And then that's kind of the idea
3498040	3502400	of like, geothermal anywhere. So if you're kind of able to drill
3502400	3506880	like, five kilometers or five down, yeah, that could be very
3506880	3509520	promising. And that's kind of like, in general, this is not
3509520	3512580	only true for super hot or ultra deep, but also kind of more
3512580	3516360	generally for like innovations, you're formal. What this does,
3516360	3519760	it's kind of leveraging the advances of the fracking of the
3519760	3523960	Shea gas revolution, right? So like our ability to drill has
3523960	3527000	been like, strongly increased through the through the fracking
3527000	3530360	revolution and essentially applying this to to geothermal
3530760	3533960	is kind of where a lot of the innovations coming from. And
3533960	3539560	it's kind of very attractive, because once you make it work,
3539560	3542480	right, you need to solve a couple of material science
3542480	3545880	challenges here. But like, once those are solved, you have like
3545880	3549120	a very mature labor force, and you kind of have like large
3549120	3552320	economic interests, oil and gas, that will be quite
3552320	3556600	interesting on that. So in that sense, it's kind of an innovation
3556640	3559840	that is kind of locked in, if you will, right? So like, it's kind
3559840	3561040	of not locked out, like
3562760	3566000	Yeah, but if we're talking about drilling five kilometers down,
3566000	3569080	this is not something you could do in in a person's backyard. So
3569080	3573080	this is not as decentralized as for example, setting up solar
3573080	3576720	panels on a on a roof in a residential neighborhood.
3577000	3580160	No, it's solving the same problem that small modular
3580160	3583360	reactors or like other kind of clean firm sources will solve,
3583360	3586880	right? So it's not this is not about everyone having a super
3586920	3591080	hot rock thing in their backyard. But this is about solving the
3591080	3594640	hard part of electricity decarbonization, which is kind of
3594640	3597920	clean firm resources, right? So like, not intermittent
3597920	3600640	renewables, but something that can be dispatched and it can be
3600640	3602320	used the entire time.
3602480	3605880	I guess technically, this is not a renewable form of energy,
3605880	3610320	but in a, in a kind of practical sense, it will take
3610320	3614200	billions of years for the earth's heat to dissipate enough for
3614200	3617440	this technology not not to work. So in practical terms, it's
3617440	3618160	it's renewable.
3618640	3621160	Yeah, in practical terms, I think the distinction renewable and
3621160	3626440	not doesn't matter because I mean, renewables also require lots
3626440	3630080	of non renewables, like resources to like, like, right, like in a
3630080	3632440	way, so like the minerals that you need for like solar and wind
3632440	3635120	and so like, so yeah, it's, it's not a, it's not a practical
3635120	3639040	thing to worry about. But nor nor should you kind of worry
3639040	3641200	about uranium running out or stuff like that.
3641280	3644440	Okay, we've, we've done an overview of a lot of the
3644440	3648760	technological options we have. If you were to to rank these
3648800	3652360	technologies and think about, you know, a plan for how we might
3652360	3656920	solve climate climate change using a combination of them. Where
3656920	3661600	would you where do you see most promise in the short term and in
3661600	3662200	the long term?
3662440	3666960	I mean, in the short term, it's very clear that like intermittent
3667240	3673400	renewables and natural gas will like do most of the like heavy
3673400	3676680	lifting and decarbonization in the near future. So like, because
3676680	3679160	they are quick to build and they're kind of quickly expanding
3679160	3682560	right and like, okay, in some places also adding nuclear
3682560	3686640	capacity, and also many other places like not prematurely
3686640	3689880	shutting down nuclear capacity, right? So like, yeah, so those
3689880	3693800	are I think kind of the short term and then hydropower, the
3693840	3698240	short term options. And the medium runs something like, well,
3698240	3701840	like advances in geothermal or advances in small modular
3701840	3705160	reactors, right, could kind of address what right now is kind
3705160	3707680	of a little bit of the Achilles heel of kind of electricity
3707680	3710920	decarbonization, which is kind of clean for power, right? So like
3710920	3715000	that's kind of why those are still important and like worth
3715000	3718080	doing, even though like renewables right now are cheap,
3718080	3720840	and there's kind of this like seduction of like only relying
3720840	3724360	on existing technologies. But like, the reason to not do that
3724360	3727040	is like the risk that we talked about before, but also kind of
3727040	3730800	the energy system function of like clean firm, which right now
3730800	3734600	is kind of not adequately solved. And when you say clean
3734600	3737760	firm, what do you mean? Well, so clean, right, means like zero
3737760	3740480	emissions and like zero air pollution and like otherwise
3740480	3743840	clean. So like that includes nuclear that includes geothermal
3743840	3750680	that includes fusion. If it were, if it were to happen. And firm
3750680	3754880	here means that it's essentially it is not an intermittent
3754880	3757160	resource, right? It's kind of not like solar and wind that is
3757160	3763280	kind of so yeah, it can in principle be run 24 seven. And
3763280	3766160	you will not use it for electricity 24 seven, but you
3766200	3769280	might use it for for producing hydrogen at other times of the
3769280	3774200	day. But like, yeah, essentially, that you're reducing what
3774200	3777280	storage kind of needs to do, right? Like it's becomes a lot
3777520	3780280	like building an energy system that has like clean firm
3780280	3784360	resources in it, like it's a lot more realistic to get to like
3784360	3788080	100% kind of clean than if you're kind of entirely batting
3788080	3789720	on intermittent resources.
3789880	3792520	Yeah, so you think thinking across the different climate
3792520	3796160	scenarios, it's a it will be smart strategy for us to also
3796160	3800320	invest in some of these clean firm technologies and not just
3800600	3803480	traditional renewables like wind and solar.
3803920	3808800	Okay, yeah, so I think it's kind of worth distinguishing two
3808800	3813280	separate strands of the argument here, even on kind of a normal
3813280	3816160	kind of trajectory where renewables are very successful,
3816840	3820160	like clean firm is kind of a useful compliment, right? And it
3820160	3824520	makes the overall system more efficient, it kind of like reduces
3824520	3829040	the like the necessity to like overbuild intermittent renewables
3829080	3832400	reduces the necessity of storage, etc. Right. So like, the case
3832440	3836760	for clean firms not entirely like hedging one, but then there's
3836800	3839480	also kind of the hedging one, which is like, I think we talked
3839480	3843360	about this before, right? Like, if we kind of wake up in 2040,
3843360	3846000	and like, our situation looks much worse than we're thinking
3846000	3849240	now, like, what has gone wrong? Well, one of the main things
3849240	3851640	that could have gone wrong is that like expanding solar and
3851640	3856080	wind was much hotter. And in that sense, investments in and
3856080	3860720	clean firm are like a hedge against that. And there's a key
3860720	3864360	fact of like climate that makes the hedging quality important.
3864920	3869000	And that's essentially like the shape of climate damage. So that
3869000	3872000	climate damage to kind of like, or our expectation of like how
3872000	3875160	climate damage looks like is that it's kind of strongly
3875160	3878480	nonlinear. So like, world with six degrees is like much worse
3878480	3881320	than twice as bad than a world of three degrees and the world
3881320	3883600	with three degrees much worse than twice as bad than 1.5
3883600	3887080	degrees. So it's kind of particularly important, right? I
3887080	3889560	mean, you need to control for how likely those are. But like,
3889720	3892320	it's like, even if you kind of control for how likely there
3892320	3895880	are, it's kind of important to like, favor solutions that work
3895880	3899200	in situations where a lot of damage is. So those are kind of
3899240	3902000	right now, I would say those little worlds kind of more
3902000	3907120	reflect 2.5 degrees like 2.5 to 3.5, like those are reasonably
3907120	3910320	likely and reasonably more damaging than the worst cases
3910320	3914080	that I kind of take a lot of the expected damage and the
3914080	3917040	function. And under those, like if you're in those
3917040	3919320	situations, right, you kind of, you know, something,
3919440	3921960	probabilistically speaking, you know, you know, something that
3921960	3924360	is likely to have happened in those worlds. Like one thing
3924520	3927720	is likely to have happened is that renewables will have like,
3928240	3930280	yeah, been more curtailed than we expect.
3930560	3933680	Okay, and I think we'll discuss this more later, thinking
3933680	3936520	about different climate scenarios and where we should spend our
3936560	3941160	money in, to kind of cover all scenarios. But before we get
3941160	3945200	there, I want to talk about some governmental options. What
3945200	3949040	could governments do in order to help this situation? You
3949040	3954800	mentioned before how European governments and California was
3954800	3958960	able to subsidize renewables to such an extent that they are
3958960	3963080	now quite cheap. In general, what's your sense of how well
3963080	3966480	subsidies work? Would you recommend that governments try
3966480	3970400	to pick out which which energy technologies they favor and then
3970400	3971400	subsidize those?
3971720	3976120	The broad answer to which Mrs. Canter relates to like, what is
3976160	3978200	what, how good is the government at picking winners and
3978200	3981680	like, how far should the government pick winners? I think
3981680	3985680	like, the broad answer is here, like, the government was
3985680	3988800	heavily involved in every kind of important technological
3988800	3991840	success when it comes to energy and climate, and also like
3991840	3995480	heavily involved in lots of different failures. So like on
3995480	3997840	the success, right, we have like solar, we have electric cars,
3997840	4001880	we have wind, we have nuclear, we have fracking. On the failure,
4001880	4005720	we have stuff like cylindra, we have stuff like biofuels in the
4005720	4008720	US, which are like subsidized because they're kind of big in
4008720	4011840	Iowa and Iowa is important for presidential elections. Like, so
4011840	4014720	like, you have like the good, the bad and the ugly kind of all
4014760	4018360	all together, right? So like, that's important, right? It's
4018360	4021600	like, it's not, there's essentially no example of
4021600	4024760	like energy technology transformation that kind of where
4024760	4028840	government has not played a huge role. So I think that that's
4028840	4034280	something worth, like worth remembering kind of to start. And
4034280	4039280	it's also there's no because there's no clear example where
4039280	4042120	essentially technology has been an energy technology has been
4042120	4047880	brought about primarily by market forces, right? So like, so
4047880	4050320	like there's demonstration projects, those are often
4050320	4053440	public or like at least publicly, partially publicly
4053440	4057000	funded. Then there's kind of about this basic R&D where like
4057000	4059640	government also plays a big role demonstration projects. And
4059640	4062360	there's kind of like early procurement policies like across
4062360	4065680	the entire chain of the environment of the innovation
4065680	4071080	process government plays a huge role. And I think there isn't
4071080	4074720	really an alternative to this or like we haven't really
4074720	4078720	observed an alternative to this. So I think the view that I
4078720	4080880	would kind of house like in general kind of government is
4080880	4084920	much better than its reputation. Because like once electric cars
4084920	4087320	get cheap, then we're all celebrating Elon Musk, but we're
4087320	4090680	like forgetting the fact that like, there's like huge electric
4090680	4094120	car subsidies that like may Tesla possible, right? Like, and I
4094120	4096240	mean, there's a similar story, like not to pick on Elon Musk,
4096240	4098280	right? There's a similar story for like most other kind of
4098280	4101480	technological successes. At the end, there's kind of a private
4101480	4104000	company that's kind of doing the last mile, that's getting a
4104000	4107920	lot of the attention. But like before, or even at that last
4107920	4110160	stage, there's huge, huge involvement by the government. So
4110160	4114680	I think that's that's what I can say to, to start. So government
4114680	4118280	will make mistakes. But I think the alternative is not to not
4118280	4122960	let the government pick. Ideally, and I think that's what we're
4122960	4125880	kind of seeing in the United States right now. You're
4125880	4131240	essentially trying to support technology at the right, at the
4131240	4133640	right level, right? So like, you shouldn't choose all
4133640	4136920	technologies. And you should also like be humble in terms of
4136920	4140040	like, you cannot pick all the winners. But right now, if you
4140040	4142320	look at the the inflation reduction act, and the
4142320	4146240	infrastructure bill selected to major pieces of kind of climate
4146240	4148920	policy change in the United States are now, they're
4148920	4152280	essentially like very broad, that's unlike lots of different
4152280	4155440	technologies. And they're very kind of on the one hand, like
4155480	4158680	then an infrastructure bill like R&D driven, in the case of the
4158720	4161120	inflation reduction act more like subsidy and later stage
4161120	4165120	technology driven, like, I guess they're a very strong form of
4165120	4169680	government involvement. But in a way, they're taking a lot of
4169680	4172040	winners, or like some of them will not be winners, right? So
4172040	4174640	like, they're, they're kind of very, very broad on their, their
4174640	4175680	approach to their credit.
4175880	4179880	And do you think that's the right strategy to subsidize or to
4179880	4183600	support from the government side across the right range of
4183600	4186600	technologies and across different stages of technological
4186600	4187120	development?
4187200	4189720	So if we're saying that history is informative, then I think
4189720	4192280	that's kind of what history teaches us about like innovation
4192280	4193200	and energy. Yes.
4193280	4196680	Are there any research and development into one of the
4196720	4200240	the forms of energy technology we talked about that you think
4200240	4203000	the government should spend more money on? Should the
4203000	4206400	government be subsidizing at a later stage of development, some
4206400	4207360	of these technologies?
4207720	4209840	So like, I guess the contextualized the moment that
4209840	4214000	we're in, right? So like we're in, well, mid 20 or mid to late
4214000	4218880	2023, and like, both in the United States, and to a lesser
4218880	4221120	degree also in Europe, like we've seen like major climate
4221120	4225680	policies over the last year, right? So like, like in the, in
4225680	4227800	the United States was focused on that case, right? So like the
4227800	4230560	inflation reduction act was passed, like essentially almost
4230560	4234600	exactly a year ago, a year before the infrastructure was
4234600	4238240	passed. Like both of those are kind of like, putting support
4238240	4241080	for clean energy, essentially on a whole order of magnitude,
4241080	4243880	kind of different levels. So we're now subsidizing or the
4243880	4245880	inflation reduction act, we're going to subsidize renewable,
4245880	4248920	like only renewables, clean energy, and other kind of
4248920	4253280	clean technologies on the order of like, 300 billion, at least
4253280	4257880	and could go, could go, could go higher than this. We are in a
4257880	4262480	situation where like, money is not the primary constraint right
4262480	4266720	now, for most kind of energy innovation, or it's kind of
4266720	4268960	like, it's much more harder to make that case, right? Like,
4268960	4270960	that doesn't mean we're in a situation where everything is
4270960	4273520	kind of going great, right? It's more that kind of the
4273520	4277280	challenges maybe more like stuff like permitting reform, or
4277280	4279360	kind of making those demonstration projects
4279360	4283480	happening, or like, in the case of nuclear reforming the nuclear
4283480	4287680	regulatory commission. So it's not so much about money being
4287680	4292600	the limiting constraint that and like, for the second part of
4292600	4295880	the question, should they support at a later stage? Yes,
4295880	4299640	absolutely. So I think the basic, the basic problem in the
4299640	4303280	discourse, I think is that there's relatively broad support
4303280	4307520	for like, basic research and development, right, like support
4307520	4311080	for that is kind of very kind of mainstream, right, like lots of
4311080	4313920	conservatives will kind of support investment and basic,
4314480	4317320	basic R&D, because there's a very clear market failure there,
4317360	4321680	it's very well recognized. So it's kind of very bipartisan, or
4321680	4324520	at least there's kind of like a broad kind of set of people
4324520	4328840	that will support that. But like the like the area where most
4328840	4331600	failure happens kind of in the later stages is kind of like
4331600	4334800	getting 100 million for a demonstration project. So that's
4334800	4337080	something that historically in the United States, for example,
4337080	4341000	has been hard to kind of get political buy-in to fund this
4341000	4344200	work, right? Because it's also like, when you fail, you fail
4344200	4347600	very recently, right? So like Mitt Romney in 2012, like started
4347600	4351640	his campaign at the Solyndra plan, right? Like Solyndra being
4351640	4355400	like kind of the example of the failure of kind of the clean
4355400	4359040	energy investments of the Obama administration. So maybe, maybe
4359040	4362120	explain what happened there. I'm not familiar with the, is it
4362120	4363320	called Solyndra?
4363560	4366960	Yeah, so like Solyndra was kind of like an advanced solar company
4366960	4370360	that kind of was kind of heavily supported by the American
4371120	4374920	Reinvestment Act, so kind of the small scale version of what
4374920	4377920	Biden did now, like enlarge with inflation reduction act, kind
4377920	4380880	of like so the recovery after honey, 18, the clean energy
4380880	4384360	spending there. And Solyndra was kind of a very, very public
4384360	4388760	failure of a company that was kind of heavily backed by the
4388760	4391880	government. And yeah, essentially became the symbol of
4391880	4394960	like, okay, the government is really bad at picking winners,
4394960	4398440	right? And like, that kind of happened. At the same time as
4398440	4400920	kind of the shale gas revolution was playing out, right?
4400920	4403560	We're like, also the government had kind of played a big, big
4403560	4406760	role in supporting that. So it's just like, we're very selective
4406760	4408640	and like picking our examples.
4408920	4413200	What do you think about carbon taxes? This is a solution to
4413200	4417480	climate change that's often favored by economists, where
4417480	4420680	you you simply price the negative externality of
4420680	4423920	emissions, and then you let the market figure out how to
4423920	4428240	implement the how to reduce emissions. Do you think carbon
4428240	4430720	taxes could work? So and I guess I mentioned this in the
4430720	4433360	beginning, but just just to recap. So before I joined
4433360	4437480	founder slash, I spent five years working on carbon pricing
4437480	4441680	emission trading system, carbon taxes. So I'm very familiar
4441680	4445280	with those debates. I mean, I think they can work. But I think
4445280	4450280	they will not play, like a major role in kind of the solution.
4450400	4453760	And just like to give a couple of, couple of like arguments,
4453760	4456800	why? So if you're like thinking again about kind of the
4456840	4461240	example of like solar, and how solar got cheap. So the
4461240	4464000	subsidies that kind of Germany was able to kind of that were
4464000	4468240	politically feasible in the early 2000s in Germany. You could
4468240	4472960	have achieved them with a carbon tax between like 700 to 900
4472960	4476240	something in that range, dollars per ton. That's an
4476240	4480120	insanely high carbon tax. So like at that point, most of the
4480120	4482760	world had no carbon taxes at all, right, like Germany had no
4482760	4484760	carbon tax at all, like the only kind of countries having
4484760	4489840	carbon taxes for like, Scandinavian countries. And like
4489840	4491960	even then, like the highest carbon tax will be something like
4491960	4497400	$50 a ton, right? So like, the really kind of transformative
4497400	4500560	price signal that you need to like drive an immature
4500560	4506400	technology, you will probably never get where the carbon tax
4506400	4509600	that's politically feasible, right? Like you could not, it's
4509600	4512720	not that you could have had the carbon tax at that level at that
4512760	4517040	time. So I think that's kind of one reason, right? And now we're
4517040	4519120	essentially like now we're essentially this situation where
4519120	4521560	like solar were kind of the difference to the fossil fuel
4521560	4524000	alternative was kind of zero in many cases, right? You wouldn't
4524000	4528640	need a carbon tax. Essentially, to solve climate change, you need
4528640	4533240	fundamental technological transformation. And for that, you
4533240	4536520	need like very, very strong push and you cannot get this kind of
4536520	4541720	push with a with a politically feasible price. So that's kind
4542240	4544600	one constraint. And the other constraint is kind of the
4544600	4550800	international situation. So if you were in a situation where you
4550800	4553560	would have a global carbon tax, right, like maybe or a global
4553560	4557600	kind of carbon price, maybe that would be enough to kind of
4557600	4561560	induce some some innovation, etc. But like, you never, like,
4561560	4566640	it's very far, very far from getting there. So I think right
4566640	4571360	now we're in a situation where it's very clear that the most
4571360	4574480	significant things that like individual countries can do, like
4574480	4576720	in a situation where international coordination is
4576720	4581320	relatively weak, are not about kind of introducing a carbon
4581320	4585880	tax, like had Germany introduced the carbon tax in 2005,
4585880	4588040	this would have or sorry, in 2005, we got the emission
4588040	4590800	trading system. So let's say if we had like introduced like
4590800	4594720	reasonably high carbon prices early in the 2000s, would have
4594760	4598440	kind of accelerated like transition from like German
4598440	4601160	coal to Russian gas, that would have been the main effect
4601160	4603360	would not have had like transformative effects,
4603720	4607240	globally speaking, right? So like, that's, I think, the really
4607280	4613080	big constraint there. So essentially, yeah, carbon
4613080	4619040	taxes might play a role. Once all technologies are reasonably
4619040	4623120	close to competitiveness, and then kind of iron out a little
4623120	4627360	bit on the on the margin. But I guess that that's kind of like
4627400	4630080	not not the point where it really matters anymore.
4630400	4633480	Yeah, and just just to check with you, what do you what do you
4633480	4638160	think about planting trees? Is that with that work at all? Is
4638160	4642720	that on the kind of what would that have a large enough effect
4642720	4647320	to matter? You sometimes hear claims about the importance of
4647320	4653680	the Amazon rainforest, for example, as a way of decreasing
4653680	4658960	CO2 in the atmosphere, could the government initiate a large
4658960	4662640	kind of projects of planting more forest for that work?
4662880	4667040	So I mean, in principle, the easier thing had should always be
4667040	4671400	avoiding deforestation, because planting trees to like to have
4671400	4675000	a carbon effect, right, like it takes 20 years. It's not
4675000	4679160	instantaneously useful. I mean, I guess, I guess to start with
4679160	4682520	again, now we kind of need to refocus on, we're talking here
4682520	4686040	on the margin. And when we talk about trees, everyone loves
4686040	4689560	trees. Like the person I meet the most, like the superficial
4689560	4692080	kind of climate person I meet the most, right? Like the first
4692120	4694600	like, they want to like they want to plant trees, like that's
4694600	4697240	the first thing that essentially everyone kind of coming into
4697240	4698520	this conversation jumps to.
4698800	4701400	Yeah, this is exactly why I brought it up, because I'm
4701400	4705320	guessing that this proposal would be extremely popular with a
4705320	4709520	kind of broad public and maybe that itself, even though planting
4709520	4713040	trees may may not be the most effective thing. Just the fact
4713040	4715720	that it's so popular might mean that it's it's easier to
4715720	4718280	implement. And that could be an argument for it.
4718440	4721360	Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, you would need to do a certain
4722680	4726240	insane scale. But so if you if we're thinking about the kind of
4726240	4729320	the existing solution on this base, which is essentially about
4729320	4732320	like rainforest protection, right? And like there we have kind
4732320	4736920	of an international carbon market around protecting rain
4736920	4741200	forests, like called web plus. And the basic idea there is like
4741880	4748840	you're rewarding countries for avoiding deforestation. So and
4748840	4752000	like the most significant example of this is like between
4752000	4755520	Norway and Brazil, where like Norway kind of tried to like pay
4755520	4758800	Brazil lots of money to kind of like, yeah, save kind of like
4759120	4763360	deforest less. And the problem with that is I think
4763360	4767920	fundamentally that you're rewarding something you can't
4767920	4770760	observe, like you're rewarding counterfactual, like you're
4770800	4775240	rewarding, of additionally avoided deforestation, which is
4775240	4779520	not something you can observe, right? So like your and so like
4779520	4782840	that is kind of hard on the best case. And it's like,
4782960	4785800	essentially impossible when you have like sovereign nation states
4785800	4789440	that all can kind of have their own, their own estimates. So
4789440	4792680	that's one of the problems. And the other problem, of course,
4792680	4797160	is kind of a snot. Like the main benefit of like avoiding
4797160	4799880	deforestation comes from the long term again, right? So like,
4800200	4804160	but you can't really have like credible, credible commitments
4804160	4807160	over like decades in terms of protecting trees. So like it's
4807160	4812120	a solution that like looks seductively simple, but kind of
4812120	4816640	in practice, kind of doesn't work. Yeah, so like that's kind of
4816640	4818880	the case for avoiding deforestation and for planting
4818880	4821600	trees. Yeah, I mean, you need to do those on an extremely
4821600	4824600	massive scale. And like, it's not going to have large effects
4824600	4826920	kind of in the, in the short term.
4827120	4831720	Yeah, are there any other non technological options that you
4831720	4833960	like, or that you find promising?
4834160	4836120	There's lots of other things we can do, right? So like, I think
4836120	4839840	one thing that we should talk about briefly would be climate
4839840	4843240	finance. So which is essentially the idea of like
4843280	4847560	incentivizing lower income countries for like building or
4847560	4850000	like paying essentially paying more clean energy
4850240	4853800	infrastructure. Yeah, in principle, that's one of the
4853800	4856240	things that you would expect if we had a global carbon market,
4856240	4859160	right? Because like abating abating emissions should be
4859160	4863040	cheaper in a lower income country. So that's another
4863080	4865760	approach of kind of a software from many of the problems I've
4865760	4869400	now talked about with regards to with regards to rainforest
4869400	4873320	protection. So that's another approach that I think we should
4873320	4876640	mention. And then there's kind of when you're kind of in a
4876640	4880080	situation where you have a lot of growth happening, right? So if
4880080	4884160	you're kind of an emerging Asia right now, there is a lot of
4884160	4887560	variance and like how emission intensive that growth can be. So
4887560	4892040	like we've just hired a carbon looking specialist who like she
4892040	4895480	will kind of look at what what are the interventions we can do
4895480	4898040	there. But like if you kind of look at the literature, you can
4898040	4901440	kind of see like clear differences related to, yeah,
4901440	4905240	like how our city is being built and these kind of things like
4905240	4909360	kind of shape essentially shaping long run behavioral
4909360	4912160	patterns by like different forms of infrastructure
4912680	4913360	investments.
4913680	4917080	Yeah, and you mentioned supporting innovation or
4917080	4918280	innovation policy.
4918520	4922000	And that's kind of ties to what we've talked about before,
4922000	4924960	right, which is like, the government is essential for
4924960	4929720	technological transformation. What the government does can be
4929720	4933160	affected by advocacy, you can kind of fund through like where
4933160	4937520	you can find a charity to do this kind of work. And it is it
4937520	4940720	locks it kind of souls for this like what I described is like
4940720	4944200	the central conundrum of climate policy, right, that kind of
4944720	4949720	essentially the gas that you have like way more leverage through
4949720	4952720	innovation on like global emission outcomes than like
4952720	4955720	through their territorial emissions. So you have this
4956480	4959760	potential for trajectory changing dynamics, right, that we've
4959760	4962720	kind of been discussing with the example of solar electric cars
4962720	4967600	et cetera that relatively small changes in the world, like in
4967680	4971640	the large in the grand scheme of things, right, like California
4971640	4975360	aggressively supporting electric cars or Denmark aggressively
4975480	4978160	supporting wind power, these are like small changes on the world
4978160	4981960	but like huge long term consequences. So I think that's
4981960	4985280	kind of the thing and like the other things that I would
4985280	4989560	mention, so like kind of on the on the carbon carbon lock inside
4990280	4994040	would be stuff like, yeah, essentially regulatory reform,
4994040	4997680	right. And the US this would be something like permitting
4997960	5001400	reform, which which will become like a hot issue or is already
5001400	5004480	becoming a hot issue because the financing for clean energy is
5004480	5008840	there but the permits and the regulation is not there. And
5008880	5012400	they're similar similar issues and like emerging emerging
5012400	5016920	economies. So it's not all about technological innovation, not
5016920	5019400	at all. Right. It's also about like, yeah, shaping the
5019400	5023800	regulatory frameworks, etc. And here you're using
5024040	5029040	some amount of money in order to influence a much bigger amount
5029040	5032440	of money. Basically, you're using philanthropic dollars to
5032680	5036040	influence the dollars or the money spent by governments.
5036480	5039720	Yeah. So for everything that we're kind of funding and
5039720	5044000	there's always there's always kind of advocacy and the broader
5044040	5047680	sense of the term. So I'm kind of saying essentially, using
5047680	5050800	philanthropy to influence much larger budgets, right? And like
5050840	5054560	like that reasoning comes from the fact that like, all government
5054560	5057400	budgets are like several orders of magnitude, like two to three
5057400	5062560	orders of magnitudes, larger than philanthropy. And also, I
5062560	5064840	think what we've already touched on, right, like, there's
5064840	5068000	things that kind of essentially need the government, even if it's
5068000	5071200	like changing regulation, etc. Right. So like, most impact
5071200	5074240	focused philanthropy and climate is ultimately about kind of
5074520	5078120	shaping actions of the government, you know, or other large
5078440	5078920	actors.
5079280	5082920	Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I do wonder, though, aren't
5082920	5087000	there a lot of kind of interest groups trying to get the
5087000	5091400	government to spend money on on various things. And so you might
5091440	5094080	there might be a lot of competition for influence over
5094080	5096000	over the government's resources.
5096520	5100200	When I just talked about like the different sizes of the
5100200	5106000	changes in the world, that kind of relates relates to this. So I
5106000	5109360	think that the best case or like the kind of the highest impact
5109360	5113360	case for like philanthropy to have like a large impact on
5113360	5116720	government policy is kind of in situations where there's like
5116720	5121240	relatively little attention, right? So like, if we're kind of
5121240	5124040	thinking about the counter example of like the carbon
5124040	5128160	tax, like needs national attention needs like bipartisan
5128160	5130040	support to be passed definitely needs national
5130040	5132960	conversation. Like that's probably a situation where like an
5132960	5135400	additional fund traffic dollar will not make a large difference
5135400	5139880	because kind of like lots of other money is involved. But when
5139880	5142800	you're kind of in a situation where like, you know, okay, we're
5142800	5146800	going to pass this big climate bill. And like, there's a big
5146800	5150160	national conversation about we want to do this, the climate
5150160	5154320	bill, but ultimately, like how exactly does this climate bill
5154320	5158400	look like, which technology does support and how that is kind of
5158400	5161280	a thing, the sweet spot for kind of philanthropy, right,
5161280	5164760	because we're essentially lots of political science literature
5164760	5167040	for like how this kind of works. It's what's called like
5167040	5171120	legislative subsidy. So there's kind of special charities that
5171120	5174440	kind of specialize and like knowing which legislation would
5174440	5177440	be needed to kind of promote a given technology or given
5177440	5181200	approach. And yeah, essentially providing providing that
5181200	5185000	knowledge to the policymakers. So I think that's kind of a way
5185000	5189720	in which in which charities can have a large influence and kind
5189720	5194640	of policy fields that are less politicized and that are kind
5194680	5199040	of like under, yeah, that are kind of not not not super not
5199040	5200120	super crowded. Yeah,
5200360	5204640	let's give an overview of the different climate scenarios. So
5204680	5207840	what's most likely to happen with the climate and specifically,
5207840	5211320	I think we should talk about the worst cases and how likely
5211320	5211840	those are.
5212000	5215640	If you kind of look at the forecast, there's something like
5215680	5220760	one third probability that we will kind of meet global climate
5220760	5224880	targets. So that would be like limiting warming to two degrees.
5226000	5228840	Then there's kind of about another third for something
5228840	5233080	like between two, two and three degrees. And then there's kind
5233080	5236320	of another third for everything kind of above three degrees from
5236360	5240600	up to like five degrees. So this is kind of from a we can we can
5240600	5242640	link this in the show notes, but like that's kind of from an
5242680	5245840	from an LSE paper that kind of try to try to estimate those
5245840	5249360	last year. And but like, there's different ways to estimate
5249360	5252480	this, but it's kind of like broadly, broadly consistent. So
5252480	5255720	like, we're probably not in current trajectory is not going
5255720	5259160	to meet the global climate targets. We're gonna overshoot
5259160	5264600	them by a degree or so. At the same time, right, kind of the
5264600	5267280	really extreme scenarios, like six degrees or something like
5267280	5271640	that has become like, very, very significantly less likely
5271640	5274120	compared to what we believe like five or six years ago.
5274360	5277880	Yeah, maybe you could describe some of the effects of the
5278000	5281000	these different degrees of heating. It's a bit abstract
5281000	5283400	when we're talking in terms of degrees, could you describe
5283400	5286200	some of the effects of different degrees of heating?
5286600	5288880	I mean, again, like this is of course an area where there's
5288880	5291680	always like huge uncertainties, right? So like, we're like, if
5291680	5294520	you look at the bars, like when do certain phenomena starts
5294520	5296800	is kind of always like, okay, this could start at two degrees,
5296800	5299720	because start at four and five degrees. I mean, the thing that
5299720	5301920	we're kind of like right now, we're kind of in a situation where
5301920	5304560	we can, where we can essentially see climate change in our
5304560	5307240	daily lives, right, where kind of the temperature extremes
5307680	5312720	have clearly changed. Also, like where like many, not all, but
5312720	5315160	like kind of many kind of natural disasters have a climate
5315160	5318080	change signal on there, right? So it kind of become more likely
5318080	5321440	or more intense related to climate change. So that's kind of
5321480	5327640	where we are right now. It's broadly kind of, I guess, probably
5327640	5331560	think these things have become more, more intense. Then if
5331560	5334240	you're kind of, I guess if you're hitting two degrees or more
5334280	5338240	than like tipping point, tipping points become somewhat more
5338240	5340680	likely. So there are elements in the climate system that either
5340680	5343160	would kind of have like local environment effects or like
5343160	5346560	dieback on the Amazon, for example, or kind of have like
5346560	5350320	global climate effects, like shifting global temperature up
5350320	5353600	by a half a degree or something of that sort. So those kind of
5353600	5359080	things become kind of become happening, happening more as we
5359080	5362400	moving higher up. Yeah, I think that's kind of the main thing.
5362400	5364960	So I would say this is pretty abstract. The reason for that is
5365000	5367960	this is not really what I'm not really spending a lot of time on
5367960	5370720	that. I'm mostly interested, like, give them what I'm doing
5370720	5373520	day to day, I'm mostly interested in understanding the
5373520	5376440	shape of the curve, and how likely the different futures are
5376480	5379400	because that's kind of what's most relevant for me to prioritize.
5379640	5383000	And so are you prioritizing the worst case scenarios?
5383400	5386880	No. And I'm really happy that you asked this because this is a
5386880	5391720	very typical misunderstanding. So what I'm essentially arguing for
5391840	5395560	and I will talk about this, which we can also link like on the
5395600	5398200	structure of climate risk and its implications for high
5398200	5401800	impact philanthropy. What I'm essentially asked arguing for is
5401800	5404520	we treat this the same that we will treat other problems. So
5404520	5409440	like, we're essentially looking at expected damage, right? So
5409440	5413560	like an expected damage is the product of two different things
5413560	5416920	is like the probability of different futures and how bad
5416920	5423840	those futures would be. And right now, most of the probability
5423840	5425920	mass, so when we put these things together, based on the
5425920	5429240	current estimates would be on the other side, I think, like
5429240	5433360	above, like most of the damage would be above 2.5 to 3.5. But
5433360	5436800	crucially, it would not be in like six degrees or more. Because
5436800	5438840	that's like, even though those worlds will be extremely
5438840	5441640	damaging, they've become so much less likely that they're so
5441640	5444920	that kind of the degree, like the low likelihood kind of
5444920	5448000	dominates the strength of the signal. So it's not about just
5448000	5452120	focusing on the worst world is kind of taking an expected
5452120	5457400	damage. And the alternative to this, that I'm criticizing is
5457400	5461480	essentially much of the focus of the climate community, where
5461480	5464640	it's like, black and white, like either we meet the goal of the
5464640	5467440	Paris Agreement or we don't, like there's all of this massive
5467440	5470440	complexity that you talked about. And we're just reducing it
5470440	5473960	to, okay, on a two degree trajectory, we will need this
5474000	5476160	and this and this. And like, that's kind of, I guess, in a way,
5476160	5479640	the wrong question. Where do you see the most expected damage
5479640	5482880	then? Yeah, so and the last time we ran these numbers, and we
5482880	5485760	should run them again this year. But like, it's kind of, I
5485760	5488800	think, in those worlds that are both reasonably likely, and
5488800	5490840	also much more like significantly more damaging
5490840	5493400	than kind of the best case worlds, right? So they will be like
5493880	5499400	worlds of like 2.5 to 3.5 degrees, roughly, that's kind of
5499400	5504680	where the bulk of the damages. So those are worlds where the
5504680	5507840	Paris Agreement has not succeeded, right? Because me, the
5507840	5509840	Paris Agreement's goal is to limit temperature to two
5509840	5513360	degrees. They're also like worlds where like, yeah, some
5513360	5517200	things must must clearly have gone wrong. They're also not
5517200	5521360	worlds like those worlds are not consistent with like, super
5521360	5525200	cheap renewables, easy seasonal storage, etc. Yeah.
5525360	5529000	Yeah. And in those worlds, what are the most promising
5529040	5532760	interventions to alleviate the expected damage?
5532920	5537480	The method here is, let's think about, because we're in a
5537480	5540520	situation of extreme uncertainty, about lots of
5540520	5542960	different things, like how much our economy is going to grow,
5542960	5545920	how carbon tensiles is going to be, how will different
5545920	5550400	technologies play out, how strong will the climate react? And
5550440	5553080	all of these things are highly uncertain. But we're trying to
5553080	5556200	understand, what do we know about the structure here? Like,
5556320	5559560	what do we know? What is more likely to be true in a worse
5559560	5562920	world, essentially? So like, on the technological level, or we
5562920	5565880	already talked about this, right? So like, okay, a typical,
5565880	5570040	like there's kind of two, two typical, or two, I think, failure
5570040	5572440	moods that people would expect. Like one is kind of like,
5573040	5577000	renewables do not scale as much. Another would kind of be that
5577800	5581080	electrification doesn't scale as much, right? So that's kind of
5581320	5586040	related. So if renewables don't scale as much, then like, the
5586040	5589120	clean firm power sources that we talked about, right, those are
5589120	5592920	kind of, we're gonna play a relatively larger role. So like,
5593440	5596240	a significant part of the motivation of like, investing in
5596240	5599880	geothermal, investing in advanced nuclear kind of comes not all
5599880	5604160	of it, but like, comes from that. There's of course, also like
5604200	5607960	other aspects to this, right? It's not only about the choice of
5607960	5611360	energy technology, it's also about like, different kinds of
5611360	5616600	solutions. So if you're kind of thinking about those futures,
5616800	5621160	like those are not futures, where, as a side, like, international
5621160	5625000	cooperation on climate, like being in a great shape is not
5625000	5630280	consistent with being in the 3.5 world. So that means that
5630320	5633440	things that kind of maybe look very good on the best case,
5633440	5635840	right? Like if the best case is kind of like the case that we're
5635840	5641160	in right now, or probably even better, let's say, saving trees
5641160	5643560	on the Amazon, like, if we could kind of get this to work,
5643560	5647400	right? Like, even if that were very cheap, and the best case
5647400	5651560	where we solve this regulatory problem that so far, we were not
5651560	5654640	able to solve. Now, that's not going to work in this kind of
5654640	5657720	world, right? So, so, so that's, I think, something that's kind
5657720	5661280	of contraindicated on this case, right? So it's kind of like, this
5661280	5665120	will look worse. And similarly, if you kind of think about the
5665120	5669200	structure of the world economy, like, and kind of like the future
5669200	5672680	for predictions, you probably have like, more of the higher
5672680	5676600	warming worlds are like, in situations where like emerging
5676600	5681120	economies have been growing very strongly, right? So like, yeah,
5681160	5684320	we're making us like, let's say Africa is kind of growing, and
5684320	5686720	growing very strong. So it also tells us something about like,
5687120	5689640	regional prioritization, some level,
5689960	5693160	I think actually, that's, that's a great segue to where I would
5693200	5697440	like to, to, to end this conversation by talking about
5697480	5702120	kind of interactions between climates and, and other areas we
5702120	5706080	could call them. What are the tradeoffs between economic
5706080	5708520	development and emissions?
5708760	5713040	Yeah, so that depends on where you are with regards to economic
5713040	5717320	development. So there's a very strong relationship between
5717320	5721720	economic development or human development more generally, and
5721800	5724960	use of energy. And that's like, not like a one direction
5724960	5728000	causation, right? So like, we shouldn't say like, more energy
5728000	5732440	causes more development. But we should say that it would be very
5732440	5735560	surprising that the world gets a lot richer without losing a lot
5735560	5739000	more energy. So I think that's very clear. And like, there's
5739240	5741760	papers on that that show this very clearly. And like, it's like
5741760	5744880	kind of really, really strong kind of relationship. And the
5744880	5748560	relationship is much, much stronger in the earlier part of
5748560	5752560	the ladder, right? So like, high income countries right now are
5752560	5756240	able to grow without growing their emissions, right? So there's
5756240	5762360	like, about 20, 25 countries or so that have been able to grow
5762360	5764720	over the last decade, grow the GDP without growing their
5764720	5768400	emissions, what would be kind of like the, the weak kind of
5768400	5771600	condition of decoupling, right? It's kind of not doesn't mean
5771600	5773640	they will meet their climate goals, but it kind of means that
5773640	5776680	kind of growth is kind of possible without increasing
5776680	5782360	emissions. But that is not true on the, on the lower end, right?
5782360	5786360	And like, broadly for, for three reasons, if you're kind of
5786360	5790680	very energy poor, then like, so if you can kind of save more
5790680	5794560	energy, like energy efficiency gains, etc. will just use like
5794640	5797600	probably translate into into more energy use. I think that's
5797600	5801560	kind of one reason there's two other ones. So one is kind of
5801560	5804560	like earlier economic development is kind of more, more
5804560	5807120	carbon intensive, right? So it requires stuff like that
5807120	5809440	requires little steel and cement, the kind of stuff that's
5809440	5812760	kind of hard to decarbonize right now, or which we actually
5812760	5816600	have not decarbonized to this point at like, reasonable cost.
5816920	5821320	So that's kind of another aspect to this. Yeah, so that
5821320	5824560	essentially you're doing lots of infrastructure investments
5824600	5827320	that are very early. And of course, also like the willingness
5827320	5832200	to pay for climate policy is like, very low and rightly so very
5832200	5834960	low if you're not in a very energy poor context, right? If
5834960	5837880	you're in India and have like 400 million people without
5837880	5840600	access to electricity, then like the first thing that you're
5840600	5842920	thinking about is not implementing a carbon tax.
5843000	5849280	And so we mentioned one very large benefit of using less oil
5849280	5852760	and coal, which is to add, which is a decrease in air
5852760	5856760	pollution. Do you think there are other additional benefits?
5857320	5861240	Here I'm thinking in terms of greater food stability or less
5861280	5864360	conflict or something like that?
5864840	5867400	I would call it the more sophisticated case about caring
5867400	5870640	about climate change is probably less about like extreme
5870760	5874040	weather events and the like the dire impacts of extreme weather
5874040	5877480	events, but more like political instability and conflict,
5877520	5881560	especially in places that are heavily dependent on like, well,
5881560	5884120	environmental conditions, right, right? So if you kind of in
5884120	5887240	sub-Saharan Africa, and you have like rain-fed agriculture,
5887280	5890120	like that is probably the most likely case where you can get
5890640	5894240	social destabilization because of climate change, because
5894240	5897520	you're like the vulnerability is very high. So yeah, I think
5897520	5902680	that's kind of an important effect. This seems like very
5902680	5905480	important from like, like, ethically speaking, from a
5905480	5907600	perspective of like, okay, this is like climate change is
5907600	5911360	hurting the global poor the most. And like, it's kind of the
5911360	5916560	most destabilizing probably in those in those areas. So I think
5916560	5920000	that's a very important effect. And something that I think
5920000	5923920	effective altruists, it's easy for effective altruists to forget
5923920	5927160	that, because in a way, if you kind of think about climate as a
5927160	5931280	civilizational risk, I think I would agree that the civilizational
5931320	5934720	risk aspect of climate is kind of low, because it's kind of hard
5935080	5939000	to imagine a great power war because of climate change. And I
5939000	5940680	guess, like, if you're kind of caring about the long term
5940680	5943200	future, like great power wars are just like, extraordinarily
5943200	5946440	important. But kind of from the from the more near term suffering
5946440	5949760	perspective, like, I think that's a very significant effect.
5950760	5956920	And another one that comes more from essentially making clean
5956920	5960360	energy cheap, right, is kind of thought like reducing energy
5960360	5963040	poverty. So I just, I just mentioned, like, I guess 400
5963040	5966800	million people in India, not having access to electricity,
5966800	5970320	right? So like, we're living in a world where like, what we are
5970320	5973120	thinking about first when we're reducing emissions, right, like
5973120	5976960	we can use we can all use a lot less energy, without like,
5977280	5981040	sacrificing a lot of our living standards. But we're not living
5981040	5985240	in a globally representative part of the world. Both of us and I
5985240	5988600	think most listeners. So it's kind of a very different
5988600	5991240	situation, like the average human on this planet is like very
5991240	5995000	energy poor and like, we're the human development benefits of
5995000	5999760	access to more energy are very significant. Yeah, so and ideally
5999760	6002760	if it's quite clean and cheap energy, that's the ideal, ideal
6002760	6003200	case.
6003360	6006560	Yeah, that's a great point. Your Highness, thanks for coming on
6006560	6009320	the podcast. It's been a real pleasure. Thanks for sharing
6009320	6010240	your knowledge with us.
6010680	6011840	Yeah, thank you so much.
6012760	6013640	Great to be here.
