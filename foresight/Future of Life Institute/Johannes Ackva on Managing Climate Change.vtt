00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Welcome to the Future of Life Institute podcast. My name is

00:03.800 --> 00:08.400
Gus Docker and I'm here with Johannes Aquar. Johannes is a

00:08.900 --> 00:12.640
researcher at Founders Pledge where he leads the Climate

00:12.640 --> 00:15.600
Change Fund. Johannes, welcome to the podcast.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.280
Thanks so much for having me, Gus. Great to be here. I'm a big

00:18.280 --> 00:21.520
fan of the Future of Life Institute. And yeah, happy to

00:21.520 --> 00:23.040
talk all things climate today.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.960
Perhaps we could start with your role at Founders Pledge. What

00:26.960 --> 00:29.480
is it that you do there? How do you how do you see your role?

00:29.600 --> 00:34.160
Yeah, so I think the way I usually describe it is like my

00:34.160 --> 00:39.440
goal and the goal of my team is kind of to like find and fund

00:39.440 --> 00:42.280
kind of the highest impact opportunities and climate and

00:42.280 --> 00:44.760
those are like philanthropic opportunities, right? So like

00:44.760 --> 00:47.960
things where we can wear a million dollars or something in

00:47.960 --> 00:50.920
the quarter of magnitude can kind of make a difference by

00:50.920 --> 00:54.920
supporting initiatives that are like extremely promising. And

00:54.920 --> 00:56.720
yeah, as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning, right? So

00:56.720 --> 00:59.440
there's kind of the climate fund, which kind of puts this

01:00.440 --> 01:02.560
to life, the Founders Pledge Climate Fund, but also we're

01:02.560 --> 01:05.880
advising kind of, I know for individuals kind of beyond that

01:05.880 --> 01:09.120
and kind of trying to, yeah, trying to identify using

01:09.120 --> 01:11.840
research and using privatization research, kind of to

01:11.840 --> 01:15.320
identify where where are the biggest blind spot, what are the

01:15.960 --> 01:18.600
blind spot generating mechanisms, if you will, and kind of

01:18.640 --> 01:22.000
what does that mean for what you should fund on a margin as an

01:22.000 --> 01:22.840
ex philanthropist?

01:23.080 --> 01:25.920
Yeah, and I think that word is the key. So thinking on the

01:25.960 --> 01:29.640
margin here, I see your job, or I think that that your job is

01:29.640 --> 01:32.880
about thinking about the marginal dollar, where is that

01:32.880 --> 01:35.640
dollar best spent? Would that be the correct frame?

01:35.760 --> 01:38.880
Yes, the next dollar or the next million dollar. And I think

01:38.880 --> 01:42.440
that's like really, really crucial frame, because I think a

01:42.440 --> 01:45.760
lot of the things that I am going to be saying is going to be

01:45.760 --> 01:49.920
like, controversial, and might be wrong. If like, if one would

01:49.920 --> 01:53.040
interpret them as unlike, this is all we should be doing. And

01:53.040 --> 01:55.120
that's, I'm not really talking about this is all we should be

01:55.320 --> 01:58.520
doing. I'm talking about like, at the margin, this is what we

01:58.520 --> 02:01.760
should be doing relatively, relatively more off. Yeah, we're

02:01.760 --> 02:06.280
going to get into a broad overview of the whole climate

02:06.280 --> 02:08.680
change issue. We're going to look at all the potential

02:08.680 --> 02:12.720
technologies or government options that might help us

02:12.760 --> 02:16.000
alleviate this problem. But I think we should start with your

02:16.000 --> 02:19.800
personal journey as an environmentalist. So how did

02:19.800 --> 02:22.360
you end up in this role? Where did you start? When did you

02:22.360 --> 02:24.360
first become interested in the climate?

02:24.560 --> 02:29.080
So, I mean, I grew up in the 90s in Germany, so it was very

02:29.080 --> 02:33.040
easy to kind of become an environmentalist, I think. So

02:33.080 --> 02:35.720
kind of in my, I remember, like some of my first childhood

02:35.720 --> 02:39.040
memories kind of being very interested in saving the tigers

02:39.040 --> 02:43.040
as like inventing a board game, save the Siberian tiger kind of

02:43.040 --> 02:46.680
like, like, yeah, there was a, an animal documentary on like

02:46.680 --> 02:49.560
three times a week and like the last five or 10 minutes of the

02:49.560 --> 02:52.880
documentary would always be like, okay, and now humans are

02:52.880 --> 02:55.840
destroying this beautiful nature, right? So that that was kind

02:55.840 --> 03:01.280
of, I think, very big part of kind of, yeah, of this, of this,

03:01.280 --> 03:04.480
I think, initial, initial education, or becoming an

03:04.480 --> 03:08.160
environmentalist. And I guess I got more serious about this kind

03:08.160 --> 03:10.760
of, yeah, in my, in my teenage years, when I was like an

03:10.760 --> 03:15.120
environmental activist for the German chapter of Friends of

03:15.120 --> 03:18.840
the Earth, and kind of like, protesting President Bush to

03:18.840 --> 03:21.360
sign the Kyoto Protocol when he was visiting this kind of

03:21.360 --> 03:24.200
stuff. So that's kind of where it started. And then I kind of

03:24.200 --> 03:27.160
when I came to to university, I think the idea for me was, okay,

03:27.160 --> 03:30.760
let's kind of study social sciences with a focus on like

03:30.760 --> 03:33.720
understanding what's kind of what kind of makes climate

03:33.720 --> 03:37.680
policies successful. So that's kind of what I spent kind of my

03:37.680 --> 03:41.440
studies on. And then I was working afterwards, for, for a

03:41.440 --> 03:43.920
think tank in Germany for five years, kind of working on

03:43.920 --> 03:47.160
carbon pricing. And that's kind of, ultimately, after this kind

03:47.160 --> 03:50.480
of joint joint foundry pledge kind of went into philanthropy.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.400
So that's kind of the story.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.640
Yeah. And what's something you've changed your mind about? Where

03:56.680 --> 04:00.400
where have you gotten new ideas or learned new facts that kind

04:00.400 --> 04:01.920
of changed your priorities?

04:02.040 --> 04:04.840
I mean, lots, lots and lots over the years, right? So that was

04:04.840 --> 04:07.440
kind of like a very short introduction to like a 20 year

04:07.440 --> 04:12.200
journey. I think the first big change probably in college kind

04:12.200 --> 04:15.080
of. So at that point, I was kind of, yeah, very strongly kind

04:15.080 --> 04:17.480
of, yeah, as I said, like influenced by the environmental

04:17.480 --> 04:20.720
movement kind of was kind of card carrying environmentalist,

04:20.720 --> 04:24.440
if you will. And essentially, at that point, kind of, yeah, as I

04:24.440 --> 04:26.600
said, I was kind of studying social science or kind of

04:26.600 --> 04:31.440
focusing on political culture and understanding in a way that

04:31.440 --> 04:34.760
like the things that I believed or the kind of people like me

04:34.760 --> 04:37.120
would believe about how to solve the climate change, right? So

04:37.120 --> 04:40.240
like, heavily focused on renewables, heavily focused on

04:40.240 --> 04:44.120
energy efficiency, heavily focused on lifestyle change, being

04:44.120 --> 04:46.960
anti nuclear being somewhat skeptical of technological

04:46.960 --> 04:49.320
innovation, right? That essentially, all of those

04:49.320 --> 04:52.240
beliefs kind of fit together kind of in a very systematic

04:52.240 --> 04:55.920
fashion, right? And what unites them is not that they're kind

04:55.920 --> 04:58.520
of an adequate response to the climate challenge, what unites

04:58.520 --> 05:01.880
them is that they're kind of part of a specific ideology and this

05:01.880 --> 05:05.280
kind of this case kind of like a kind of egalitarian green

05:05.840 --> 05:08.080
ideology, which kind of is framing a large part of the

05:08.080 --> 05:11.520
climate conversation. So I think that was kind of the first

05:11.560 --> 05:14.600
really important realization that like all of all of the

05:14.600 --> 05:17.360
responses to the climate and to other problems are kind of

05:17.360 --> 05:21.080
heavily ideological shaped, right? And like, if you have a

05:21.080 --> 05:23.380
situation like every other climate, which is kind of

05:23.380 --> 05:26.440
dominated by one kind of ideology, this will kind of shape

05:26.440 --> 05:30.840
the shape the results. So so I think that was kind of one, I

05:30.840 --> 05:34.840
think another one a bit later, when I was studying in the in the

05:34.840 --> 05:40.920
United States, this was like 2012, 2011, 2012. This was the

05:40.920 --> 05:44.480
time where essentially in the US kind of the big push, the

05:44.520 --> 05:48.800
big push under Obama to kind of push for climate policy. Waxman

05:48.800 --> 05:51.840
Markey was the name. So that kind of a cap and trade bill in the

05:51.840 --> 05:55.240
United States kind of had just failed, right? And this was like

05:55.240 --> 06:00.040
a once in a generation moment with regards to climate policy in

06:00.040 --> 06:02.000
the US, right? So like the Democrats had like won the

06:02.000 --> 06:05.760
presidency had like a huge majority in the House and the

06:05.880 --> 06:09.200
Senate as well, right? So like, was kind of a situation of

06:09.200 --> 06:11.400
reckoning, like, what are we going to do now? Because like,

06:11.440 --> 06:14.240
even even under such favorable conditions that we kind of can

06:14.240 --> 06:18.000
expect every like 15 or 20 years, like, we're not able to pass

06:18.000 --> 06:22.160
climate policy in the US. So I think in that time, kind of

06:23.000 --> 06:26.120
discovered kind of I think what I would describe is kind of like

06:26.120 --> 06:29.800
the innovation hawk argument in climate, right? So like people

06:29.800 --> 06:33.480
that are like very heavily focused on innovation, which I

06:33.480 --> 06:37.200
think at that time was kind of not that big a part of the of

06:37.200 --> 06:40.640
the climate coalitions. I think that's kind of another thing

06:40.640 --> 06:44.600
that changed around that time. And I don't think I go all the

06:44.600 --> 06:47.720
way but it's kind of interesting. So because in a way, what they

06:47.720 --> 06:50.560
did or what they were emphasizing kind of became a big part of

06:51.080 --> 06:53.840
climate policy that later passed. So like that has just passed

06:53.840 --> 06:57.280
with President Biden is kind of essentially putting this lots of

06:57.280 --> 07:00.320
those ideas into practice. But so that's another one. And then I

07:00.320 --> 07:03.760
think another kind of big one, of course, for me growing up as a

07:03.760 --> 07:07.720
German environmentalist, I was heavily anti nuclear. And being

07:07.720 --> 07:10.920
in the US also is the first time kind of exposed to pro nuclear

07:10.920 --> 07:15.280
environmentalists. And for a time was kind of lukewarm about

07:15.280 --> 07:19.000
nuclear and at some point kind of realized, okay, even though it's

07:19.000 --> 07:22.480
very uncomfortable in the German context, because otherwise

07:22.480 --> 07:25.480
reasonable people become like very unreasonable and very

07:25.480 --> 07:28.520
emotionally aggressive, like, when you're talking about nuclear

07:28.520 --> 07:30.760
and when they became pro nuclear, but that was kind of an

07:30.760 --> 07:35.480
important shift of mind as well. I think those are kind of three.

07:36.480 --> 07:43.280
And then two more recent ones, I would say, 2015, essentially a

07:43.280 --> 07:49.600
success of the Paris Agreement. So up until 2015, I think

07:49.640 --> 07:53.280
international climate policy by and large had always failed. And

07:53.280 --> 07:56.520
this was kind of like, the expectations were very low. And

07:56.520 --> 07:59.960
then the fact that the Paris Agreement kind of succeeded,

07:59.960 --> 08:02.280
even though it's kind of a non binding agreement, but it can

08:02.600 --> 08:05.840
has completely changed the conversations that we're having

08:05.840 --> 08:08.680
in different countries. So it kind of serves as this kind of

08:10.080 --> 08:12.840
North Star that kind of lots of national conversations that

08:12.840 --> 08:15.920
kind of focused on. So I think that's kind of was another

08:15.960 --> 08:16.600
surprise.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.280
In what sense did the Paris Agreement succeed? What would

08:20.280 --> 08:21.280
have been the results of it?

08:21.400 --> 08:25.240
I mean, the Paris Agreement has succeeded. I mean, not only the

08:25.240 --> 08:27.840
Paris Agreement, but like around that time. So like that was

08:27.840 --> 08:31.920
in late 2015, and then like 2016, 2017, the nature of the

08:31.920 --> 08:34.560
climate conversation has completely changed, right? Like

08:34.560 --> 08:37.960
around that time in Western countries anyway, in the sense

08:37.960 --> 08:42.200
that like before it was kind of a relatively niche issue, and

08:42.200 --> 08:45.280
it kind of became like a broad societal consensus that like

08:45.680 --> 08:48.560
meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement matters. I mean, it's

08:48.560 --> 08:51.480
maybe not political consensus across the political aisle in

08:51.480 --> 08:54.760
all countries, but at least kind of for the left, the central

08:54.760 --> 08:59.160
left kind of in all countries. So I think that kind of really

08:59.160 --> 09:02.560
changed and kind of the idea of net zero and that climate was

09:02.560 --> 09:07.240
kind of a top issue. Yeah, so I think that's kind of I think

09:07.560 --> 09:10.160
what the Paris Agreement achieved, right? And like, this is

09:10.160 --> 09:13.520
kind of very significant, like compare it, right? It's like

09:13.520 --> 09:15.920
it's a non-binding treaty, ultimately. So there is a

09:15.920 --> 09:20.200
version, I think you could have had a cynical take on this

09:20.200 --> 09:23.000
agreement kind of before, like it's not and I certainly had

09:23.000 --> 09:25.360
this to a degree, like it's not going to do much because it's

09:25.360 --> 09:28.760
like a non binding, very weak agreement on some level, that's

09:28.760 --> 09:32.320
true. So that's not what it's doing, what it's doing, it's

09:32.320 --> 09:34.720
kind of like transforming, conforming the conversation.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.680
And you mentioned a last thing that you changed your mind on?

09:38.920 --> 09:43.320
I think a last thing that I would mention is kind of that. I

09:43.320 --> 09:47.120
think that's kind of maybe like 2020 or so. Essentially, that

09:47.480 --> 09:50.720
the situation around climate has improved very, very

09:50.720 --> 09:53.720
significantly, which is kind of funny to say this, because I

09:53.720 --> 09:56.160
think most people have the have the opposite perception. But

09:56.160 --> 10:00.640
like, in general, that like so like in 2015, 2016, people were

10:00.640 --> 10:05.240
saying things like, there's a 5% probability of some of more of

10:05.240 --> 10:08.800
six degrees, or more warming. And I think right now, if you

10:08.800 --> 10:12.080
would make this forecast, the forecast right now would be

10:12.080 --> 10:15.040
something like maybe like half a percent that we get to six

10:15.040 --> 10:17.400
degrees at all, and not more than six degrees, like an order of

10:17.400 --> 10:23.240
magnitude change. And so essentially, that the forecast

10:23.240 --> 10:26.520
before we're probably with pessimistic, but also that the

10:26.520 --> 10:29.800
situation kind of has has changed very significantly, mostly

10:29.800 --> 10:33.200
through the success of renewables, the success of kind of

10:33.240 --> 10:37.480
electric cars that essentially the the very high risk climate

10:37.480 --> 10:41.640
futures are essentially almost ruled out at this point. And

10:41.640 --> 10:43.480
that's a very significant change.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.000
I'm wondering, when you're working with climate change,

10:46.000 --> 10:50.880
this is such a complex issue. It's it's a it involves a lot of

10:50.880 --> 10:55.600
disciplines, not just climate science itself, but economics

10:55.600 --> 11:00.440
and law and the physics and engineering and all of these

11:00.440 --> 11:04.440
disciplines, how do you form an all things considered view of

11:04.440 --> 11:07.840
the situation in light of all of these disciplines? I mean, you

11:07.840 --> 11:12.040
can't go get a PhD in all of them, I'm guessing. And so how do

11:12.040 --> 11:13.920
you yeah, how do you how do you approach this?

11:14.040 --> 11:16.440
I mean, in theory, you could but by the time you have those

11:16.440 --> 11:22.640
PhDs, the problem was solved. Yeah, so I think the answer here,

11:22.680 --> 11:26.080
I mean, has to be to kind of, essentially, you're always in

11:26.080 --> 11:29.840
the state of like kind of being a reviewer and kind of like a

11:29.840 --> 11:32.560
reviewer of different pieces of evidence. So that's like one

11:32.560 --> 11:35.400
piece of the answer. Another piece of the answer is kind of

11:35.400 --> 11:38.240
obviously, you do this on a team, right? So like, essentially,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.720
right now, in my team, well, like we have a specialist kind of

11:41.720 --> 11:44.160
for the technical economics, we have a specialist for Carmlock

11:44.160 --> 11:48.440
and emerging economies, we have a specialist for philanthropy and

11:48.440 --> 11:50.720
have other philanthropists behave. So that's kind of another

11:50.720 --> 11:53.080
piece of the answer. But to, I think to answer it more

11:53.080 --> 11:56.520
substantively, I think there's kind of like, three kinds of

11:56.520 --> 11:59.880
expertise that are like most significant, when it comes to the

11:59.880 --> 12:02.800
question of like, that I'm trying to answer, which is like,

12:02.800 --> 12:06.160
what should we be doing philanthropically, right? So which

12:06.160 --> 12:10.160
is kind of like only one way to answer the question of there,

12:10.160 --> 12:12.880
I think it's kind of like one is kind of really the social

12:12.880 --> 12:16.280
science question of like political visibility, like, which

12:16.280 --> 12:19.520
kind of like carbon taxes, can we get where which kind of

12:19.520 --> 12:22.640
policies can we achieve in a given country? So that's kind of

12:22.640 --> 12:26.760
like, what does the option space actually look like? So that's

12:26.760 --> 12:29.760
kind of, I think, one key expertise. The other one is kind

12:29.760 --> 12:32.320
of like, what do different policies or different kind of

12:32.320 --> 12:34.240
things in the world, what do they achieve, right? So like,

12:34.240 --> 12:37.280
that's, I guess, policy analysis on econometrics and stuff like

12:37.280 --> 12:41.160
that. And then there's kind of because climate change is really

12:41.160 --> 12:45.080
a decadal challenge and the global challenge and like, it's

12:45.080 --> 12:47.480
also a challenge of like, global technological transformation.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.080
So then there's kind of this question of like, what do changes

12:51.120 --> 12:54.120
and countries kind of what are the long term consequences of

12:54.120 --> 12:56.720
that and kind of changing the technology stack, if you will,

12:56.720 --> 12:59.040
globally, so it's a techno economic question. And I think

12:59.040 --> 13:04.160
those three expertise was I kind of the most, most relevant

13:04.160 --> 13:08.320
ones, from a, from a solution oriented perspective. And then

13:08.320 --> 13:10.400
of course, if you're a philanthropist like myself,

13:10.400 --> 13:13.480
then also like, what are other philanthropists doing, right?

13:13.480 --> 13:16.880
Because like, doing the best thing on the margin is almost

13:16.880 --> 13:20.880
always about kind of finding blind spots and filling the

13:20.880 --> 13:21.560
blind spots.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.960
Okay, so let's get to this broad overview that I would like of

13:25.960 --> 13:29.000
climate change on the broadest possible scale. What is it that's

13:29.040 --> 13:34.160
driving climate change? Is it mostly emissions? And if so,

13:34.160 --> 13:35.760
where are these emissions coming from?

13:35.800 --> 13:40.720
So it's like mostly mostly emissions, right? And so like all

13:40.720 --> 13:44.960
of the mean all of climate change is about emissions. And so if

13:44.960 --> 13:47.000
you kind of I mean, there's sort of different ways to slice it

13:47.000 --> 13:50.320
by I guess, let's first kind of slice it by sector. So if you

13:50.320 --> 13:55.160
kind of look at it by sector, then there's like 75% of

13:55.160 --> 14:00.880
emissions are related to kind of energy and energy here like one

14:00.880 --> 14:03.680
very important thing about climate electricity is only a small

14:03.680 --> 14:07.160
part of energy electricity is about a third of energy. So like

14:07.160 --> 14:10.080
when I say 75%, that's not only electricity, right? That's also

14:10.080 --> 14:13.400
kind of transport fuels that's heating fuels and that's also

14:13.400 --> 14:16.040
stuff like industrial heat. Essentially, the burning of

14:16.040 --> 14:21.520
fossil fuels to produce energy. So that's about 75% of emissions.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.560
Then there's about 5% of emissions that's kind of emissions

14:26.560 --> 14:30.360
from industrial processes. So stuff like producing cement or

14:30.360 --> 14:32.840
chemicals where you kind of have emissions that are not related

14:32.840 --> 14:36.640
to fossil fuels that are called process emissions, right? And it

14:36.640 --> 14:39.920
doesn't mean that industry is only 5%. This is about the kind of

14:39.920 --> 14:43.880
the non energy share of industry. So that together gets you to

14:43.880 --> 14:48.800
like about 80%. And then there's about 15 or like 18%. That's

14:48.800 --> 14:53.320
kind of related to agricultural emissions, broadly. And then the

14:53.320 --> 14:57.520
last 5% or so is kind of a combination of on the one hand,

14:57.520 --> 15:01.640
stuff like deforestation, and then the other hand, stuff like

15:01.640 --> 15:06.320
waste. So yeah, I think 80% of the challenge is kind of energy

15:06.360 --> 15:09.760
energy industry. There's two important qualifications to

15:09.760 --> 15:14.000
this. This is kind of where the emissions are coming from right

15:14.000 --> 15:17.480
now, right? And like, that doesn't mean that this is exactly

15:17.520 --> 15:20.320
proportional to what the solution looks like. So like, it can

15:20.320 --> 15:24.120
definitely be the case of kind of land use change and kind of

15:24.120 --> 15:27.080
like restoring wilderness, etc. It's like a bigger part of the

15:27.640 --> 15:30.320
of the solution pipes. I think that's kind of one qualification.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.960
And another qualification is that these percentages are kind

15:33.960 --> 15:39.520
of heavily dependent on what warming metrics you use. So the

15:39.520 --> 15:42.240
numbers that I cited right now are kind of for what's called

15:42.240 --> 15:45.920
global warming potential 100. So like, if we're kind of assuming

15:45.920 --> 15:50.400
over the course of 100 years, if you kind of take a shorter view,

15:50.400 --> 15:53.200
if you would say something like global warming potential for the

15:53.200 --> 15:56.560
next 20 years, then something like agriculture would have like a

15:56.560 --> 16:00.440
larger share because methane, which is a very potent greenhouse

16:00.440 --> 16:02.920
gas in the short term has kind of a relatively larger share in

16:02.920 --> 16:04.960
agriculture than in other sectors. So that's another

16:05.080 --> 16:06.640
important qualification here.

16:06.760 --> 16:11.400
Yeah. And in global terms, our emissions still increasing?

16:11.720 --> 16:12.200
Yes.

16:12.760 --> 16:16.600
And how long do we expect them to increase?

16:16.880 --> 16:19.040
Well, I mean, people have been talking about the end to

16:19.040 --> 16:22.080
emission increase for a long time. And then there's always

16:22.080 --> 16:26.640
something, something else coming up. So I think we will

16:26.640 --> 16:31.280
probably see the end to increasing emissions this

16:31.280 --> 16:36.760
decade. So I mean, it's mostly dependent on what China and India

16:36.760 --> 16:39.960
are doing at this point. And they're both kind of, yeah, have

16:39.960 --> 16:43.400
to go to kind of peak their emissions rather soon. So it could

16:43.400 --> 16:45.280
happen, could happen this decade.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.520
Yeah, you mentioned China and India, we should talk about

16:47.880 --> 16:51.360
geographically where emissions are coming from, where, where have

16:51.360 --> 16:53.440
they come from in the past and where are they likely to come

16:53.440 --> 16:54.280
from in the future?

16:54.480 --> 16:57.440
Well, so I think in the past, right, if you kind of take the long

16:57.440 --> 17:00.440
view, then, and that's like, most of the emissions are certainly

17:00.440 --> 17:03.600
like have been caused by, by Western countries, I think

17:03.600 --> 17:07.440
that's, that's kind of clear. And like, we do have being in

17:07.440 --> 17:12.000
Western countries, like a large historical responsibility. But

17:12.000 --> 17:14.640
if we kind of look at the situation right now, like the US

17:14.640 --> 17:18.000
right now, something like 15% of emissions, the EU is something

17:18.000 --> 17:24.440
around like 10%. And like Asia is kind of something like close

17:24.440 --> 17:28.800
to two thirds of emissions and then kind of the rest. And if we

17:28.800 --> 17:31.520
kind of think this picture going forward, right, so like the

17:31.520 --> 17:35.280
share of the EU and the share of the US is going to kind of

17:35.280 --> 17:38.600
further decrease, I mean, probably to something like for the

17:38.600 --> 17:43.200
US to something like 5% for like the EU, maybe something like

17:43.200 --> 17:48.080
3%. And then, yeah, China is going to be something like 25% I

17:48.080 --> 17:51.280
think over over the course of the century, then other other

17:51.280 --> 17:54.800
emerging Asia kind of India and then Southeast Asia. And then

17:54.800 --> 17:58.120
kind of at some point later in the century, Africa, hopefully

17:58.120 --> 18:01.760
will, hopefully will grow strongly and like, I mean, yeah,

18:01.800 --> 18:03.840
let's hope it's going to be low carbon. But like, I guess

18:03.840 --> 18:07.320
there's kind of this kind of also part of the long game. So

18:07.320 --> 18:11.480
like the emissions are very clearly the focus of emissions

18:11.480 --> 18:14.520
is very much changing, right? That's kind of what I sometimes

18:14.520 --> 18:17.960
call like the central conundrum of climate policy, which is like

18:18.920 --> 18:22.440
the people that are responsible for a lot of the historical

18:22.440 --> 18:27.040
emissions kind of have very little direct leverage and kind of

18:27.040 --> 18:30.280
how the problem is going to become because kind of

18:30.280 --> 18:33.360
essentially, in the EU, like there's not a lot of emissions

18:33.360 --> 18:35.440
you can reduce like I mean, anymore, right? Like I mean,

18:35.440 --> 18:39.040
already kind of reaching the goal of getting to carbon

18:39.040 --> 18:42.120
neutrality by 2050 is like very ambitious. But at that point,

18:42.120 --> 18:43.880
like there's there's no leverage left.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.320
Because you project that EU is only going to be 3% of emissions.

18:48.320 --> 18:52.040
And so reducing emissions by 3% would be great, but it's not

18:52.040 --> 18:54.440
going to tackle the problem in a big way.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.040
Essentially, most of the leverage that the EU has on

18:59.040 --> 19:03.080
emissions does not come from the own territorial emissions,

19:03.160 --> 19:05.600
right? So if we kind of look at the most significant things

19:05.600 --> 19:09.800
that EU countries have done, it's like things like Denmark

19:09.880 --> 19:12.920
making wind energy cheap, Germany kind of making solar

19:12.920 --> 19:16.920
cheap. These these kind of things have like done way way more

19:16.920 --> 19:21.160
to like transform the energy future than like emission

19:21.160 --> 19:22.120
changes within Europe.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.360
European countries have subsidized technologies that can

19:25.360 --> 19:28.440
then be exported to other countries where they can decrease

19:28.440 --> 19:31.800
emissions much more than they could in those European countries

19:31.800 --> 19:34.800
themselves. From what you're saying that the biggest problem

19:34.880 --> 19:38.920
or the biggest driver of emissions is energy production. I

19:38.920 --> 19:42.640
wonder if that category is too broad. I mean, a lot of things

19:42.640 --> 19:46.560
must must be covered by energy production. Is it? What what

19:46.560 --> 19:47.800
does that category cover?

19:47.960 --> 19:50.360
Yeah, so like I think, yeah, I mean, it covers kind of

19:51.000 --> 19:55.920
electricity, it covers heating, it covers transport, and it

19:55.960 --> 19:58.360
also covers, I mean, that's also heating, but it's kind of

19:58.360 --> 20:00.440
very different than what we mean when we say heating like

20:00.440 --> 20:03.600
stuff like industrial heat, right, which like steel and stuff

20:03.600 --> 20:06.680
like that. And like on some level, it's kind of true broader

20:06.680 --> 20:11.080
term. I still find it useful to think about as kind of one

20:11.080 --> 20:13.800
piece, because especially if we're thinking about the kind of

20:13.800 --> 20:17.200
the solution trajectory, right? So like, what like, I guess the

20:17.200 --> 20:20.280
master plan plan and so far as there is a master plan to kind

20:20.280 --> 20:25.240
of solve climate, right? As essentially electrify everything

20:25.600 --> 20:28.760
or like mean electrify all energy consumption, right? So that

20:28.760 --> 20:32.000
sounds like, historically, those sectors have been very

20:32.000 --> 20:34.880
different, but like, or kind of also very different in terms of

20:34.880 --> 20:38.760
the fuels, but like, you want to get in a situation where like,

20:38.840 --> 20:42.560
the central problem is one of kind of on the one hand getting

20:43.120 --> 20:47.360
electricity or energy production kind of low or zero carbon. And

20:47.360 --> 20:49.640
on the other hand, kind of either directly right with

20:49.640 --> 20:52.880
electric cars or indirectly through stuff like hydrogen,

20:53.520 --> 20:56.600
electrifying kind of a lot of other stuff. So in that sense,

20:56.600 --> 20:59.920
it's a cross simplification to speak of like energy as one

20:59.920 --> 21:03.640
sector, but it's also, I think, if we're kind of at the broad

21:03.640 --> 21:07.560
level, it's a useful one in terms of, yeah, in terms of the

21:07.560 --> 21:08.360
solution landscape.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.440
Yeah, so so the categories is kind of unified by the same

21:12.440 --> 21:16.720
solution, the same solution would solve all of the the the

21:16.720 --> 21:19.400
things that belong to that category. So electrification

21:19.400 --> 21:23.040
would be a solution for many of the things that belong to that

21:23.040 --> 21:24.680
category. Or is that too strong?

21:24.840 --> 21:27.080
I mean, it's just a little bit too strong. But I think it's

21:27.080 --> 21:31.120
kind of right in the, yeah, basically right, I would say,

21:31.280 --> 21:34.800
right. So, so how far electrification goes kind of

21:34.800 --> 21:37.840
depends on like, like things are differentially easy to

21:37.840 --> 21:41.200
electrify. So like, things that are hard to electrify stuff that

21:41.200 --> 21:45.040
kind of requires, I mean, either a long duration of storage or

21:45.040 --> 21:48.160
like lots of kind of concentrated energy, or so like

21:48.160 --> 21:50.520
stuff like heavy duty transport, right, like electrifying

21:50.520 --> 21:53.840
trucks is much harder than electrifying passenger cars. And

21:53.880 --> 21:57.560
like, like refining large or like decarbonizing large ships,

21:57.600 --> 21:59.760
it's kind of much harder and airplanes much harder than

21:59.760 --> 22:04.040
cars. So, and for some of those, you might either use kind of

22:04.040 --> 22:06.680
indirect electrification, right? So kind of like hydrogen or

22:06.680 --> 22:10.800
like using power to create hydrogen. But it might also go

22:10.920 --> 22:14.400
another way, you can also kind of create hydrogen kind of with

22:14.400 --> 22:18.280
natural gas and carbon capture and storage. Yeah, so that's kind

22:18.280 --> 22:21.960
of where there is more, more nuance there, where we can kind

22:22.280 --> 22:23.240
of dive deeper.

22:23.280 --> 22:27.720
Why is it more difficult to electrify an airplane than a car?

22:27.800 --> 22:30.840
Is it is it because the airplane will have will have a need for

22:30.840 --> 22:33.840
higher peak energy output or something like that?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.720
Well, it's essentially, I mean, batteries are very heavy. And so

22:37.720 --> 22:40.440
like an airplane becomes much more efficient, because once you

22:40.440 --> 22:44.760
burn the fuel, it's kind of not, it has no weight anymore. And

22:44.760 --> 22:47.400
it's also so like that's kind of one part. And like the other

22:47.400 --> 22:50.400
part is kind of like energy, energy density, right? So like,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.920
in principle, like flying and air, like flying kind of requires

22:52.920 --> 22:56.080
a lot of, like, it's kind of much harder than kind of moving

22:56.120 --> 22:59.360
moving a car around. And so you kind of need, need higher energy

22:59.360 --> 22:59.880
density.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.040
Okay, so what I want to do is to walk through all of the

23:03.040 --> 23:06.960
potential technological options we have. Start with that. I'm

23:06.960 --> 23:10.800
going to start with talking about oil and coal, which is kind

23:10.800 --> 23:14.760
of a funny place to start maybe, because in some sense, oil and

23:14.760 --> 23:17.760
coal is is the whole reason for the problem. But I think it's

23:17.760 --> 23:21.440
interesting to discuss oil and coal just because if we know

23:21.440 --> 23:24.160
something about why they are hard to replace, we might know

23:24.160 --> 23:28.240
something about how to how to best go about the climate change

23:28.240 --> 23:33.360
problem. So yeah, I've written down that that oil and coal is

23:33.360 --> 23:38.040
cheap, and it works in existing systems. Do you see other

23:38.040 --> 23:40.040
advantages beyond those I just mentioned?

23:40.840 --> 23:45.800
Yeah, I think those are kind of the the two really big ones,

23:45.800 --> 23:48.520
right? And like work in existing systems, I think another way to

23:48.520 --> 23:52.640
put this is like, we've essentially built an entire world

23:52.640 --> 23:56.480
economy around them. So they fit with existing systems, because

23:56.480 --> 23:58.840
we built an entire economy around them and not only in the

23:58.840 --> 24:01.640
economy, right? Like the United States is kind of having

24:01.640 --> 24:04.120
aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, because kind of

24:04.120 --> 24:07.080
protecting oil reserves is kind of part of the, well, it's like

24:07.080 --> 24:10.400
part of the overall kind of strategy, right? So it's like,

24:10.720 --> 24:14.280
yeah, essentially, we've been spending more than a century

24:14.280 --> 24:19.480
optimizing our energy and world economy for relying on oil,

24:19.680 --> 24:23.920
alcohol, natural gas, I think another kind of advantage that

24:23.920 --> 24:27.280
they do have, I mean, at least if we compare them to renewables,

24:28.640 --> 24:32.440
to most renewables is that they do have higher energy

24:32.440 --> 24:37.520
densities. So yeah, and then of course, I mean, in the case of

24:37.520 --> 24:41.200
oil, right, like oil is easy to transport, coal is also relatively

24:41.240 --> 24:45.120
easy to transport with gas, it's a bit harder. Yeah, so I think

24:45.120 --> 24:48.040
this is kind of like broadly speaking, that's that seems like

24:48.280 --> 24:49.280
the right characterization.

24:49.480 --> 24:53.080
And of course, the enormous disadvantage here is that there's

24:53.120 --> 24:58.120
very high emissions associated with oil and coal. And I think

24:58.120 --> 25:01.480
additionally, there are, there are quite large problems with

25:01.520 --> 25:04.560
air pollution, which provides us with an additional reason to

25:04.560 --> 25:07.480
replace oil and coal, maybe you could talk about air pollution

25:07.480 --> 25:10.640
from from oil and coal. How big of a problem is that?

25:10.800 --> 25:15.760
So air pollution at large kills about 7 million people every

25:15.760 --> 25:20.920
year. So it's like one of the leading causes of death. And not

25:20.920 --> 25:23.400
all of that is related to fossil fuels, right? So like, we also

25:23.400 --> 25:25.960
have the situation that some of that is actually related to

25:26.480 --> 25:30.560
renewables, like to, especially in Africa, people burning wood

25:30.560 --> 25:33.800
for heating at home and for cooking. So that that's actually

25:33.800 --> 25:37.080
a situation where like using a fossil fuel, in this case, natural

25:37.080 --> 25:39.920
gas would actually be much better because it would. But

25:39.920 --> 25:45.480
essentially, so, in particular, coal and oil, kind of, yeah,

25:45.520 --> 25:48.360
yeah, kill kill a lot of people. So gas is a lot cleaner. So gas

25:48.360 --> 25:52.920
is about 15 times cleaner than coal in terms of air pollution.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.320
But it's a very significant cause of death. And I think it's

25:56.320 --> 26:00.520
also really underappreciated. So like, people usually talk about

26:00.560 --> 26:04.440
air pollution is kind of like a co benefit of climate change.

26:04.880 --> 26:08.560
Unlike climate change has to get really bad to kill like 5

26:08.560 --> 26:11.320
million people every year. Like, right? So like, it's kind of

26:11.320 --> 26:15.200
quite possible that resolving climate change and like the most

26:15.200 --> 26:18.200
significant effect of that is kind of a reduction in kind of

26:18.520 --> 26:21.600
air pollution casualties, right? Obviously, like this is not the

26:21.600 --> 26:24.800
highest risk case, right? Like there are cases with there's no

26:24.800 --> 26:27.400
case with air pollution, like killing 100 million people, right?

26:27.400 --> 26:30.320
And there's kind of cases, there's a risk cases around

26:30.320 --> 26:32.840
climate that kind of motivate caring about climate that are

26:33.080 --> 26:36.560
more extreme than killing 5 million people. But like, we would

26:36.560 --> 26:39.560
yeah, it's just just I guess it's not it's not a co benefit.

26:39.560 --> 26:42.320
It's kind of a problem on a similar order of magnitude.

26:42.440 --> 26:46.480
Yeah, makes sense. Air pollution is a huge deal. Why is it that

26:46.520 --> 26:50.720
oil and gas is hard to replace? And here we might talk about a

26:50.720 --> 26:54.600
carbon lock in also, which is a term that that's used.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.400
The primary reason that if like energy transitions are, well,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.680
energy transitions are hard for a couple of reasons, right? But

27:00.680 --> 27:03.240
like, okay, let's let's kind of start with that with a lock in

27:03.680 --> 27:08.760
reason to begin with. A lot of the assets, right, like pipelines,

27:09.480 --> 27:13.880
or coal power plants, or highways, etc. Right? Like those are

27:13.880 --> 27:16.640
very long lived assets, right? They have natural lifetimes that

27:16.640 --> 27:21.360
are like 40 or 60 years. They're capital intensive assets. So

27:21.360 --> 27:24.880
like, even if like, you're kind of in a situation where like

27:24.920 --> 27:30.280
every new build is kind of the low carbon alternative, it will

27:30.280 --> 27:33.200
take you like 40 years to kind of turn around like an entire

27:33.200 --> 27:37.520
system, right? And that's kind of an optimistic case. So like,

27:37.800 --> 27:40.480
it's like, there's a lot of kind of lock in and then there's so

27:40.480 --> 27:43.680
like, this is kind of at the pure kind of technical or

27:43.680 --> 27:46.600
infrastructural level, right? And then you also have stuff like,

27:47.560 --> 27:49.480
like pipelines and infrastructure, which are, which are

27:49.480 --> 27:53.800
even, even longer, longer lived than single assets. And then of

27:53.800 --> 27:57.120
course, you have like a huge kind of political economy, like

27:57.120 --> 28:00.040
political special interest kind of groups and kind of the

28:00.040 --> 28:02.920
entire kind of fate of countries essentially build around

28:02.920 --> 28:06.480
that, right? I guess like when people say like, Putin used to

28:06.480 --> 28:11.080
behave like the CEO of like a gas company, right? Like, I mean,

28:11.520 --> 28:14.200
kind of changed a little bit the way he's behaving. But like,

28:14.200 --> 28:17.480
right, like, it's kind of like, like their entire countries or

28:17.480 --> 28:19.960
entire kind of regions of the world that are like heavily

28:19.960 --> 28:24.040
dependent on the fossil fuel economy. So I think that's kind

28:24.040 --> 28:29.360
of another really big reason. And another reason of like,

28:29.360 --> 28:33.480
obviously, is also like energy transitions in general move

28:33.480 --> 28:36.520
towards denser forms of energy, right? So like what we're trying

28:36.560 --> 28:40.120
to do right now, where we're essentially saying, okay, we want

28:40.120 --> 28:45.080
to move from a fossil fuel dominated energy economy to one

28:45.080 --> 28:48.880
that's kind of dominated by renewables, kind of not a natural

28:48.880 --> 28:52.840
direction for an energy transition to go. So like the more

28:52.840 --> 28:56.080
natural direction of energy transitions thus far has been

28:56.080 --> 28:59.880
like from less energy dense fuels of like from biomass to

28:59.880 --> 29:03.680
fossil fuels, right? And like, going from fossil fuels to

29:03.720 --> 29:06.800
mostly mostly renewable powered systems, actually, it's not a

29:06.800 --> 29:10.520
natural move of the energy system, probably wouldn't happen.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.120
Like there are many other situations where it kind of

29:13.120 --> 29:14.080
wouldn't happen.

29:14.360 --> 29:18.320
Yeah, maybe here is a natural point to talk about energy

29:18.320 --> 29:21.440
density. Why is energy density important?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.360
So energy density, right? So like, essentially how much land or

29:25.360 --> 29:28.600
how many resources do you need to kind of produce a given amount

29:29.120 --> 29:32.880
of energy? So the reason that's important, I think, is kind of

29:32.880 --> 29:38.040
like, two fold mean from an environmental perspective, energy

29:38.040 --> 29:43.040
density is essentially a proxy for like, how much impact we have

29:43.040 --> 29:45.680
on the environment, right? So if you're using less land, using

29:45.680 --> 29:49.280
less materials, then you're kind of like principle, like lower

29:49.280 --> 29:52.360
energy density means like lower environmental impact. So that's

29:52.360 --> 29:56.040
kind of one, one part of it. The other part, which is more about

29:56.040 --> 29:59.160
like what's useful for for human civilization, right? So like

29:59.160 --> 30:02.200
having denser forms of energy, like if you're talking about

30:02.200 --> 30:05.160
electricity, it means like you need less transmission, for

30:05.160 --> 30:08.280
example, right? So like that's kind of another use. And you're

30:08.280 --> 30:13.680
also kind of, if you want to power, like an industrial center

30:13.680 --> 30:17.640
or like an urbanizing society, like having lots of energy, and

30:17.640 --> 30:21.640
having relatively dense forms of energy is useful. One shouldn't

30:21.640 --> 30:24.440
overdo this, right? It's like, I'm not saying like, on the limit,

30:24.440 --> 30:27.320
kind of, we would have like one big fusion plant and we all kind

30:27.320 --> 30:29.760
of just get from. So that's clearly not the case. I think

30:29.760 --> 30:32.840
we've seen this with nuclear fission that like, having very

30:32.840 --> 30:36.040
large kind of energy sources also as a downside, because demand

30:36.040 --> 30:39.840
isn't always there. So like, not take it to the extreme limit,

30:39.840 --> 30:42.400
but like, kind of, on some level, like energy density and

30:42.400 --> 30:45.520
principle is kind of useful, a useful metric.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.360
But when you when you talk about energy density, it's you're

30:48.360 --> 30:51.920
talking about also the resources necessary to produce that

30:51.920 --> 30:56.280
energy, not only the energy density, say, for example, of a 10

30:56.280 --> 31:01.800
centimeter by 10 centimeter cube of coal or oil or fuel for for a

31:01.800 --> 31:05.040
nuclear reactor, it's a broader term than that. That's energy

31:05.040 --> 31:07.880
density, where we have historically been moving towards

31:07.920 --> 31:10.160
forms of energy that are that are more dense. And now we're

31:10.160 --> 31:13.240
trying to move towards forms of energy that are that are less

31:13.240 --> 31:16.240
dense. I think before we get to renewables, we should we should

31:16.240 --> 31:20.040
talk about natural gas that you mentioned a couple of times. And

31:20.040 --> 31:24.640
what are the advantages here and disadvantages? I'm guessing

31:24.640 --> 31:27.320
it's it's better than oil and coal.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.800
Just to add on the energy density, like because we've talked

31:29.800 --> 31:32.560
about why it's important, but we didn't talk about what does it

31:32.560 --> 31:35.840
actually look like. So like, if you're kind of if you look at

31:35.840 --> 31:38.680
the metric site, nuclear nuclear power would be something like

31:38.680 --> 31:43.560
seven terawatt hours per square kilometers, natural gas, which

31:43.560 --> 31:46.600
we're going to talk about next, it's like about half that. And

31:46.600 --> 31:51.880
like solar is kind of about 100 or so, roughly, what nuclear is

31:51.880 --> 31:54.360
right. So that's kind of why it matters. Like the differences

31:54.360 --> 31:58.040
are quite stark, both from from renewables to fossil fuels and

31:58.040 --> 32:02.240
from fossil fuels to nuclear, like natural gas, if we talk about

32:02.240 --> 32:07.560
natural gas. So I mean, it's about half as polluting as coal, in

32:07.560 --> 32:11.840
terms of CO2. And it's much, much less polluting about 15

32:11.840 --> 32:14.920
times less polluting when we talk about air pollution. And

32:14.960 --> 32:18.480
essentially, if we look at the decarbonization successes of the

32:18.480 --> 32:22.280
last 20 years, like many of them have been coal to gas

32:22.280 --> 32:24.880
transitions. So like, essentially, the fact that the US was

32:24.880 --> 32:28.680
kind of able to reduce emissions, even though until like 2021

32:28.680 --> 32:31.280
didn't really have much in terms of climate policies, like,

32:31.640 --> 32:34.400
mostly the story of the fracking revolution in the United

32:34.400 --> 32:37.680
States, and kind of the replacement of coal by natural

32:37.680 --> 32:41.200
gas, a little bit similar in the UK, in the UK, there's kind of

32:41.240 --> 32:44.760
natural gas is also like more of a renewable expansion. And

32:44.760 --> 32:47.280
that's so like, that's kind of another select that's kind of

32:47.280 --> 32:50.920
this has been a big story. It's like an easy win, right? It's

32:50.920 --> 32:53.120
not a transformational win because you don't get to zero

32:53.120 --> 32:56.520
emissions. But it's kind of the easy win. So if you're imposing

32:56.560 --> 33:00.520
moderate carbon price, in a place with a lot of coal, that

33:00.520 --> 33:03.240
will usually mean you're gonna substitute it with natural gas.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.400
In which cases does it make sense to switch to natural gas?

33:06.600 --> 33:08.520
I mean, that's kind of like, right, that that's kind of I

33:08.520 --> 33:10.640
think something where the climate community has like two

33:10.640 --> 33:12.680
different perspectives, right? I think there are people that

33:12.680 --> 33:15.920
are more incrementalists that would say like, yeah, it's good

33:15.920 --> 33:18.920
if you're switching from coal to natural gas. There's also

33:18.920 --> 33:20.920
people that would say, okay, if you're switching from coal to

33:20.920 --> 33:24.720
natural gas, you're locking in another fossil fuel source, right?

33:24.720 --> 33:28.040
And it's kind of like better to maybe have coal run a bit

33:28.040 --> 33:31.520
longer and then fully replace it with a zero carbon source. I

33:31.520 --> 33:34.320
think that's kind of the debate. And I think different people

33:34.320 --> 33:36.640
have like different opinions. And I think also the right answer

33:36.640 --> 33:39.560
might be different in different places. The best case scenario

33:39.600 --> 33:43.680
would be one for like, natural gas replaced with coal. And then

33:44.200 --> 33:47.160
natural gas is kind of replaced with natural gas and gas and

33:47.160 --> 33:50.760
carbon capture. So where you're kind of capping the emissions

33:50.760 --> 33:53.120
or where you're using kind of part of the natural gas

33:53.120 --> 33:57.200
infrastructure with like zero carbon fuels, right? So like

33:57.200 --> 34:01.920
with natural gas kind of that's produced for electrolysis and

34:01.920 --> 34:04.960
kind of like additional like adding CO2 there or yeah, so

34:04.960 --> 34:07.800
it's a synthetic natural gas, essentially.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.600
So that last point, is there a way to produce that natural gas

34:11.600 --> 34:13.320
that's more environmentally friendly?

34:13.480 --> 34:18.000
So I mean, natural gas is CH4. So in principle, you can, you

34:18.000 --> 34:22.440
can get it from H2 like from hydrogen, like which you can

34:22.440 --> 34:25.080
generate in a low carbon way. And if you would kind of then

34:25.080 --> 34:27.760
take CO2 out of the air, so you can essentially produce like

34:27.760 --> 34:32.240
carbon neutral, natural gas, right? Like this. Yeah, or you

34:32.240 --> 34:37.760
could use hydrogen. Yeah. So essentially, there's ideas of

34:37.760 --> 34:42.080
about using some of the kind of natural gas infrastructure for

34:42.080 --> 34:45.440
like zero carbon gases. And that's I think something like one

34:45.440 --> 34:49.360
way where carbon lock in can be made a little bit less severe,

34:49.360 --> 34:51.880
right? Where you're like locking in like a gas infrastructure,

34:51.880 --> 34:55.080
for example, but that gas could at some point be carbon neutral.

34:55.200 --> 34:59.640
Yeah, if we build a new natural gas plant now, how much carbon

34:59.640 --> 35:02.880
are we locking in? For how many years would this natural gas

35:02.880 --> 35:06.480
plant have to run in order to be profitable or to make sense to

35:06.480 --> 35:09.320
build? If you're building new natural gas plants right now, I

35:09.320 --> 35:11.680
think they expect like most like if you're in a Western

35:11.680 --> 35:14.200
country, I don't think the investor would have the

35:14.200 --> 35:17.880
expectation that they're going to run this for 40 years, because

35:17.880 --> 35:21.480
like running this for 40 years would mean they're not 2023. So

35:21.480 --> 35:25.640
like 13 years after kind of most Western countries have

35:25.640 --> 35:29.120
committed to like reaching net zero. That being sad, right?

35:29.120 --> 35:32.280
Like even countries like Germany, that are kind of

35:32.320 --> 35:35.240
priding themselves to be climate leaders are building new

35:35.240 --> 35:41.200
natural gas capacity right now in an energy crisis situation,

35:41.200 --> 35:44.040
right? So we're essentially, I guess the way this becomes

35:44.040 --> 35:47.280
profitable is because we really do value energy security. So

35:47.280 --> 35:51.160
like, as countries, we're willing to kind of finance

35:51.160 --> 35:55.120
things that don't make sense in a long run perspective, if you

35:55.120 --> 35:55.400
will.

35:55.800 --> 35:59.080
Maybe we could say a bit more about energy density and why

35:59.080 --> 36:02.920
it's important. Is it important because some forms of energy

36:02.960 --> 36:06.920
take up too much space and then crowd out other other things

36:06.920 --> 36:09.240
we would like to do with that space like having natural

36:09.240 --> 36:14.400
habitats or yet using the land for agriculture or what's the

36:14.400 --> 36:17.640
problem with energy sources with low energy density?

36:17.760 --> 36:22.720
So like crowding out of like other land uses is definitely a

36:22.720 --> 36:26.320
factor, right? So especially for biofuels, I think it's a

36:26.320 --> 36:30.080
factor with like biofuels take up a lot of land and like kind of

36:30.080 --> 36:32.800
agricultural land that that can compete with like food

36:32.800 --> 36:38.000
security concerns. Yes, I think that is kind of one concern. So

36:38.000 --> 36:40.560
like land use, right? So like if I looked at a paper where

36:40.560 --> 36:43.920
essentially that's kind of modeling a transition towards a

36:43.920 --> 36:47.280
lower carbon future and what they're essentially like, and like

36:47.280 --> 36:50.680
a renewable heavy future, what they're essentially modeling is

36:50.680 --> 36:57.440
like, okay, by 2050, there is some six fold increase in the land

36:57.440 --> 37:01.200
required required for energy production compared to today. And

37:01.200 --> 37:03.520
like to be fair, like it's not that it's six times less

37:03.520 --> 37:06.520
efficient, because also like electricity production is like

37:06.520 --> 37:08.960
assumed to triple over the time frame rate. So that's kind of a

37:08.960 --> 37:12.440
halving of like efficiency in terms of like energy density,

37:12.440 --> 37:17.240
that's like a still a significant change. I think to me, the

37:17.240 --> 37:21.200
more the more fundamental challenge is really one of like, if

37:21.200 --> 37:23.440
you're having lots of decentralized energy sources,

37:23.440 --> 37:26.120
like kind of the requirements in terms of transmission and like

37:26.120 --> 37:29.640
infrastructure, build out are kind of like much, much larger,

37:29.680 --> 37:33.640
right? So essentially, when we're saying it is cheap, and it is

37:33.640 --> 37:36.320
easy to build renewables, we're talking about is kind of on the

37:36.320 --> 37:39.680
plant level where this is true. But when we're talking about the

37:39.680 --> 37:42.520
energy system level and say like we want to build an energy

37:42.520 --> 37:47.320
system that is primarily based on low energy density sources,

37:47.920 --> 37:50.360
like I'm not saying this cannot work, but like this is like a

37:50.360 --> 37:54.560
risky proposition, mostly for the for transmission and storage

37:55.280 --> 38:00.000
requirements that are kind of related to low energy density

38:00.440 --> 38:01.440
and intermittency.

38:01.560 --> 38:06.840
Okay, so that's oil, coal and natural gas. What about if we if

38:06.840 --> 38:11.240
we get into the renewables, so solar and wind? What are some

38:11.240 --> 38:13.320
advantages of solar and wind?

38:13.800 --> 38:17.160
At this point, solar and wind are pretty cheap. So at this point,

38:17.160 --> 38:19.880
I think in many, in many places in the world will be the case

38:19.880 --> 38:23.080
that like adding solar capacity to the grid is like one of the

38:23.080 --> 38:26.840
cheapest things you can do. It's very important to realize

38:26.880 --> 38:31.800
that like this is not a fact of like nature or like technology

38:31.800 --> 38:35.280
itself, that's a result of like very conscious social choices,

38:35.280 --> 38:38.120
right? I mean, it's essentially countries like Germany and

38:38.120 --> 38:41.240
jurisdictions like California, and then later kind of China,

38:41.960 --> 38:44.240
essentially saying, okay, we really want to have cheap

38:44.240 --> 38:46.840
renewables, and we're really like heavily investing that. So in

38:46.840 --> 38:48.920
that sense, kind of the fact that we have cheap renewables

38:48.920 --> 38:53.440
right now is much more a function of their popularity

38:53.480 --> 38:56.640
with constituencies than it is kind of like the principle

38:57.120 --> 39:00.160
underlying technology, right? So like, if like nuclear would be

39:00.160 --> 39:03.120
as popular as like renewables are, we probably also could have

39:03.120 --> 39:06.640
like cheap nuclear now, this is kind of what I'm saying, or a

39:06.640 --> 39:09.920
geothermal for that matter. So I think that's kind of an

39:09.920 --> 39:13.600
important aspect here. So yeah, there can be quite cheap. And

39:13.600 --> 39:16.800
also there are use cases where decentralized and kind of

39:16.800 --> 39:19.640
smaller production is kind of good, right? So I mean, you can

39:19.640 --> 39:24.840
kind of use deploy them where they are needed, right? Like if

39:24.840 --> 39:27.880
you're, if you're a small town, you're not going to build your

39:27.880 --> 39:30.960
own kind of big power plant, but you can build your, but your

39:30.960 --> 39:34.640
solar's on the rooftop, etc. So I think that's kind of the main

39:34.880 --> 39:39.120
advantage obviously produces no carbon, no air pollution. Yeah,

39:39.280 --> 39:42.160
and can be can be built quickly.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.280
Yeah, so you mentioned that that solar and wind have gotten

39:45.280 --> 39:49.120
cheaper because of basically policies by European countries

39:49.120 --> 39:52.320
and by California and so on. When when solar has reached the

39:52.320 --> 39:55.840
price point that it has that it that it's at now, does it

39:55.840 --> 40:00.080
require kind of continual subsidies to stay at that price

40:00.080 --> 40:03.640
point? Or have we developed solar to a point now that it's

40:03.760 --> 40:07.560
price competitive, even on an open market, let's say. So in

40:07.560 --> 40:10.360
energy, you generally don't have open markets. I think that's an

40:10.400 --> 40:15.840
important thing to realize. So solar is competitive in many

40:15.840 --> 40:19.120
cases, right? But like, it's not like with oil, we're like, you

40:19.120 --> 40:22.720
have a global price of oil, right? It's like, essentially, for

40:22.720 --> 40:25.600
solar, like how costs affect on the solar, compared to

40:25.600 --> 40:28.720
alternatives depends on like, how good is the solar resource?

40:29.320 --> 40:32.120
Depends also on like, how much solar is already on the grid?

40:32.120 --> 40:34.880
Because like, you can be in a situation where like installing

40:35.520 --> 40:39.280
the additional solar capacity is very cheap, but it's not going

40:39.280 --> 40:42.560
to produce a lot of additional value because essentially, like

40:42.560 --> 40:45.280
the sun is shining at the time where you're already at 100%

40:45.440 --> 40:49.080
solar, then like, it's easy to add an additional solar power

40:49.080 --> 40:52.200
plant, that's kind of it doesn't add a lot. Unless you kind of

40:52.200 --> 40:55.400
have cheap storage or cheap transmission, super cheap, sorry,

40:55.400 --> 40:58.600
super cheap transmission. So that's what's called value

40:58.640 --> 41:01.000
deflation. So it's not really like, it doesn't really make

41:01.000 --> 41:05.200
sense to think about it as like, one price point that that is

41:05.200 --> 41:08.400
being, being undercut, right? So like, we're in a situation

41:08.400 --> 41:11.920
where there are places in the world where like, adding solar

41:11.920 --> 41:14.400
kind of happens without subsidies, and it's kind of like,

41:14.400 --> 41:18.200
essentially, the natural result of like market forces or like

41:18.200 --> 41:22.080
mediated market forces. And we have also places with quite a

41:22.080 --> 41:24.200
very high renewable penetration, right, places like

41:24.200 --> 41:27.600
California, or Germany, where like, places that made renewables

41:27.600 --> 41:30.440
so cheap, but that are now kind of struggling to add a lot more

41:30.440 --> 41:33.880
because stuff like system integration, or like the value

41:33.880 --> 41:37.360
of an additional plant is kind of, is kind of low.

41:37.400 --> 41:41.120
How much of our energy production could be replaced by wind and

41:41.120 --> 41:44.880
solar alone? The problem with wind and solar, or one problem is

41:44.880 --> 41:49.760
that it's intermittent. So it requires the sun to shine or the

41:49.760 --> 41:55.080
wind to blow, unless you have a really good storage technology,

41:55.080 --> 41:59.400
basically, batteries. But how much of our energy production do

41:59.400 --> 42:01.800
you think we could replace by by solar and wind?

42:02.120 --> 42:04.560
You don't only need batteries, right? So like, essentially, you

42:04.560 --> 42:09.400
need to solve, I think, three or four problems. So like, one is

42:09.400 --> 42:13.320
kind of short term storage. For this, you can use batteries.

42:14.200 --> 42:17.520
And right, that's kind of like, okay, you can run your washing

42:17.520 --> 42:20.720
machine during the night, that that's kind of the use case.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.880
Then you kind of need to solve in most places in the world, you

42:23.880 --> 42:26.520
need to solve seasonal storage, right, so that there's kind of

42:26.520 --> 42:28.680
like parts of the year where like, there's much less solar

42:28.680 --> 42:32.040
available. Like, that's like a much, much harder challenge. And

42:32.040 --> 42:34.040
I think that's kind of underappreciated, because people

42:34.040 --> 42:36.080
talk about storage, they think about batteries, and they think

42:36.080 --> 42:39.800
the problem was solved. And like, kind of essentially, being

42:39.800 --> 42:43.640
able to have enough energy to like half a month, or like more

42:43.640 --> 42:47.240
kind of work of like energy reserve requires a very different

42:47.600 --> 42:49.840
solution. It's not probably not going to happen with batteries,

42:49.840 --> 42:52.640
that's kind of for something like, right, what I've talked about

42:52.640 --> 42:55.960
before, like, power to x, like producing hydrogen or kind of

42:55.960 --> 43:01.360
other forms of like, low carbon energy, like gases or like

43:01.440 --> 43:04.680
liquid to store energy. So like, that's kind of what you will

43:04.680 --> 43:06.760
need there. And then there's kind of the problem of

43:06.760 --> 43:11.880
transmission. And then there's a problem around essentially, do

43:11.880 --> 43:16.600
we have enough land in the jurisdictions? I think the last

43:16.600 --> 43:19.040
one will not be the decisive constraint, I think that that

43:19.040 --> 43:22.280
will will probably work. But essentially, there's like, three,

43:22.600 --> 43:25.480
three challenges, like storage in the short term, seasonal

43:25.480 --> 43:29.120
storage, transmission, I can't imagine the world, right, if

43:29.160 --> 43:32.000
when I think about the future, I always try to think of a

43:32.000 --> 43:34.840
distribution. And like, there's like part of that

43:34.840 --> 43:39.800
distribution where like, okay, wind and solar are kind of

43:39.800 --> 43:45.160
really like 80 or 90% of the energy supply. And essentially,

43:45.160 --> 43:48.040
seasonal storage has been solved, transmission has been

43:48.040 --> 43:50.360
solved, and it's kind of that that's a large part of the

43:50.360 --> 43:53.920
solution. Those are not the futures I'm particularly worried

43:53.920 --> 43:57.680
about. Because I mean, those are really very best case futures,

43:57.680 --> 44:01.120
it's like an AI safety of like AGI is inherently safe, that's

44:01.120 --> 44:05.000
kind of the future. And then there are kind of the futures

44:05.000 --> 44:08.280
where like, something has gone wrong, right? And like, that's

44:08.280 --> 44:11.960
kind of like an hour climate response and like a natural thing

44:11.960 --> 44:15.080
or things like one of the most likely failure modes right now

44:15.080 --> 44:17.600
that we can like, if we kind of if we're kind of waking up in

44:17.600 --> 44:20.880
2040, and like, we're on a trajectory to like, more than

44:20.920 --> 44:23.920
three degrees, it's very likely that kind of, we've been

44:23.920 --> 44:27.120
overbeating on intermittent renewables, that essentially,

44:27.240 --> 44:30.320
that it is much harder, even though it's easy to get to like

44:30.320 --> 44:33.880
20, 30% in electricity, like getting to like 100% in energy

44:33.880 --> 44:36.600
right again, like, and then like, growing demand, like

44:36.600 --> 44:39.720
something like 10x compared now that this is kind of really

44:39.720 --> 44:42.240
hard. So this is an area where there's very significant

44:43.280 --> 44:46.360
uncertainty, I would say we're kind of, yeah, on the top, you

44:46.360 --> 44:50.520
can kind of do almost get almost 100%, but also where it's kind

44:50.560 --> 44:54.400
of quite imaginable that you don't get over, over 50% of

44:54.400 --> 44:57.600
energy, which will still be like a huge, huge role, right? I

44:57.600 --> 44:59.760
mean, right now, it's kind of something like three to 4% of

44:59.760 --> 45:03.160
like energy. You mentioned the seasonal storage, what are the

45:03.160 --> 45:06.360
most promising approaches there? This is something where it's

45:06.360 --> 45:09.680
not primarily about batteries, right? So it's primarily about

45:09.680 --> 45:13.760
kind of using more energy dense form. So like, for example,

45:13.760 --> 45:17.080
using using kind of excess capacity, excess power

45:17.120 --> 45:20.680
capacity, to produce carbon neutral hydrogen and to store

45:20.680 --> 45:23.120
this as hydrogen or to kind of store this like synthetic

45:23.120 --> 45:27.480
natural gas. This to me seems right now, the most plausible

45:27.520 --> 45:29.840
trajectory. I mean, there's also kind of like, there's, there's

45:29.840 --> 45:32.520
lots of different technologies that are being tried out.

45:32.680 --> 45:37.400
Okay, so that's, that's solar and wind, which could turn out

45:37.400 --> 45:41.200
very, very well. But where there are challenges to be solved

45:41.200 --> 45:44.160
before they can be implemented and can constitute a large

45:44.200 --> 45:46.120
percentage of our energy production.

45:46.520 --> 45:50.480
That sounds too pessimistic. It's more like, solar and wind

45:50.480 --> 45:53.160
will definitely play a much larger role than they're playing

45:53.160 --> 45:57.680
now. The question is, will they take us to 100% but like, yeah,

45:57.680 --> 45:59.840
that's a different, yeah, it's a different framing, right? So

45:59.840 --> 46:02.840
like, yeah, the short term story is definitely about the

46:02.840 --> 46:05.120
expansion of, of mature renewables.

46:05.160 --> 46:09.640
We should say something about the, to my eyes, insane decrease

46:09.640 --> 46:13.960
in the price of solar, or at least it looks like a very,

46:13.960 --> 46:17.480
very steep decrease when I look at these graphs. Yeah, can you

46:17.480 --> 46:20.840
say something about how much cheaper solar is now compared to

46:20.840 --> 46:21.720
20 years ago?

46:22.120 --> 46:24.960
Well, it's essentially at like less than 10% of where it was

46:24.960 --> 46:29.080
20 years ago, right? So like, that's, that isn't an insane

46:29.080 --> 46:31.880
decrease. So I like, I remember when I was kind of entering the

46:31.880 --> 46:35.200
climate conversation, and people were talking about renewables,

46:35.200 --> 46:39.040
they were always talking about solar wind, geothermal, hydro,

46:39.040 --> 46:42.080
bio, at some point, people only started talking about solar and

46:42.080 --> 46:44.680
wind, right? Because essentially, those technologies

46:44.680 --> 46:48.440
could like radically cheaper, in particular, solar wind also,

46:48.440 --> 46:53.000
but a bit less so. Yeah, so that's a very, very steep decline,

46:53.040 --> 46:56.800
right, which has been achieved. There's a great book about this

46:56.800 --> 47:01.240
how solar got cheap by Gregory Named, but essentially, it's

47:01.240 --> 47:05.360
kind of primarily a result kind of very aggressive policy. I

47:05.360 --> 47:08.920
mean, it kind of goes back to the 1970s and like, the first

47:08.920 --> 47:12.280
oil crises from like Jimmy Carter, but then kind of got really

47:12.280 --> 47:15.160
picked up in the early 2000s, right, of like Germany, kind of

47:15.160 --> 47:17.720
really strongly supporting it, also like not only Germany, also

47:17.720 --> 47:21.280
like California, etc. And then like, at some point, China

47:21.280 --> 47:25.360
essentially massively investing in production capacity. So yeah,

47:25.360 --> 47:29.920
and that's kind of a big part of the story as well. It's not a

47:29.920 --> 47:32.720
story of fundamental technological innovation. It's

47:32.720 --> 47:37.560
really more of a brute force approach to making things cheap.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.360
What about Hydro? Could Hydro ever constitute a large percent

47:42.400 --> 47:44.000
of our energy production?

47:44.120 --> 47:47.200
So Hydro could, I think, I mean, it's like, it's already, I

47:47.200 --> 47:49.560
think it's still, if I'm not mistaken, it's still like the

47:49.560 --> 47:53.240
largest renewable energy resource, right? It's kind of, it's

47:53.240 --> 47:56.240
not really talked about because it's kind of like, static, it's

47:56.240 --> 47:59.040
not like the, it's not sexy, it's not where the action is. But

47:59.040 --> 48:02.680
like, it's a very significant part. I think like with Hydro,

48:02.680 --> 48:05.720
like large Hydro has like large kind of environmental

48:05.760 --> 48:08.960
downsides. And I think another kind of constrained, like, so

48:08.960 --> 48:10.920
that's a couple of other constraints. And one is like

48:10.920 --> 48:14.400
geopolitical. If you're kind of talking about them, hydropower

48:14.400 --> 48:17.040
is often like a very kind of contentious issue if you're

48:17.040 --> 48:21.000
thinking about denial or other other areas. So like, that's

48:21.120 --> 48:27.080
another big problem. And it's also like very long term

48:27.080 --> 48:29.600
infrastructure. So I think like, Hydro, I think, like from a

48:29.600 --> 48:32.240
technical perspective, like Hydro could play a larger role,

48:32.240 --> 48:35.080
but it's kind of, I don't think there are many people that are

48:35.080 --> 48:37.720
kind of betting on like an abundant future with lots of

48:37.720 --> 48:41.560
Hydro. Or at least I haven't come across them. I think I know

48:41.560 --> 48:46.800
exactly like one charity that's working on hydropower. That's

48:46.800 --> 48:49.800
mostly on making less clear paths. And the answer, they're

48:49.800 --> 48:52.360
kind of trying mostly to use hydropower, making existing

48:52.360 --> 48:57.160
hydropower or existing dams more efficient, like essentially

48:57.160 --> 48:58.840
using them more to produce electricity.

48:59.080 --> 49:04.200
Do we even have enough large rivers to, to generate enough

49:04.280 --> 49:05.680
electricity by Hydro?

49:05.880 --> 49:08.440
That's a good question. But I actually don't know the answer

49:08.440 --> 49:12.360
because it's kind of so far out of the overturned window. One

49:12.360 --> 49:15.520
other thing I want to say on Hydros that essentially Hydro is

49:15.520 --> 49:18.240
affected by climate change as well, right? So like, essentially

49:18.240 --> 49:22.240
that Hydro is becoming a less reliable energy resource,

49:22.280 --> 49:24.960
essentially, as kind of climate patterns, precipitation

49:24.960 --> 49:28.120
patterns become harder to predict and more extreme. So I

49:28.120 --> 49:30.920
think it's kind of another reason why it's not like, it's not a

49:30.920 --> 49:34.000
major bet that anyone I think is kind of really making at this

49:34.000 --> 49:38.560
point. Okay, let's move on to nuclear energy. What do you see

49:38.560 --> 49:41.320
as the advantages and disadvantages there?

49:41.600 --> 49:44.040
Hey, like the biggest advantage is like related to energy

49:44.040 --> 49:47.520
density, right? I mean, it sounds like ironic and very

49:47.520 --> 49:49.920
counterintuitive to say this, but like from an environmental

49:49.920 --> 49:52.720
perspective, like nuclear is kind of the cleanest, cleanest

49:52.720 --> 49:56.040
form of energy production. Because it's like of those that we

49:56.040 --> 49:59.000
have right now, because it's so, so energy dense, it doesn't need

49:59.000 --> 50:01.320
a lot of materials, it doesn't need a lot of land. Yeah, so

50:01.320 --> 50:05.120
I think that's kind of the clear advantage produces zero

50:05.120 --> 50:09.920
carbon disadvantages, I think are are well known in the case of

50:09.920 --> 50:15.880
nuclear. So accident risk, nuclear waste. Yeah, and also I

50:15.880 --> 50:19.760
guess some dual use concerns around like nuclear weapons. Yes,

50:19.760 --> 50:23.360
I think those are kind of the disadvantages and also right

50:23.360 --> 50:25.200
now, but that's not a fundamental feature of

50:25.200 --> 50:27.600
technology. That's kind of something of, I guess it's a

50:27.600 --> 50:31.040
result of social choice. Right now, it's very expensive and

50:31.080 --> 50:33.760
slow to build. Yeah, that was actually my my next question

50:33.760 --> 50:37.800
would be, when I look at some new nuclear power plant, it has

50:37.800 --> 50:41.800
often taken a decade or more to build. And it's gone over

50:41.800 --> 50:45.800
budget. So so why is it so? Why does it take so long? And why

50:45.800 --> 50:48.680
does it cost so much to build nuclear power plants?

50:49.200 --> 50:52.000
Like I think right now, I mean, we were able to build nuclear

50:52.000 --> 50:54.240
power plants in France and something like four years,

50:54.240 --> 50:57.160
right? And right now, we're not able to do this in the West

50:57.160 --> 50:59.440
right now, it would probably more take something like 20 years.

50:59.440 --> 51:04.920
But so there's a lot of variance here that is like, it's not

51:04.920 --> 51:07.720
like related to the features of the technology or like our

51:07.720 --> 51:10.640
fundamental technological ability, right? There's like a 5x

51:10.640 --> 51:14.800
kind of difference that's kind of related to regulation,

51:14.800 --> 51:18.200
economy, societal commitment, etc. Right? That's kind of where

51:18.600 --> 51:22.480
where the explanation ultimately has to be. So I think

51:22.480 --> 51:25.320
there's kind of lots of different reasons. I mean, one,

51:25.360 --> 51:28.520
like, I guess, one most general one, which is not nuclear

51:28.560 --> 51:30.760
specific is like in general, in the West, we're not able to

51:30.760 --> 51:32.720
build things, right? It's not only that we're not able to build

51:32.720 --> 51:35.720
nuclear plants, we're also not in Berlin, we're not even able to

51:35.720 --> 51:39.760
build airports. So, so I think that's kind of like the general

51:39.760 --> 51:42.280
class of like, there's lots of general stuff around like

51:42.280 --> 51:45.120
regulation and kind of interest groups. But then there's also

51:45.120 --> 51:47.920
like nuclear specific stuff, right? And I think it's

51:47.920 --> 51:51.160
essentially, I think the most significant part is that

51:51.160 --> 51:54.680
essentially the supply chain for for building nuclear in the

51:54.680 --> 51:57.080
West has essentially fallen fallen apart, right? So like,

51:57.600 --> 52:02.480
we're building things kind of in the first of a kind style, or

52:02.480 --> 52:05.360
kind of not first of a kind, but like first in a decade or first

52:05.360 --> 52:08.440
in a decade more, which is not the way to build like anything

52:08.440 --> 52:11.640
kind of at scale anything efficiently. That's not how France

52:11.640 --> 52:14.080
kind of built the nuclear fleet, right? So like, the most

52:14.560 --> 52:17.920
successful example of building out nuclear quickly is like

52:17.920 --> 52:23.520
France from the like late 70s to like late 80s. So that's, I

52:23.560 --> 52:29.520
think, most of the explanation. What did France do right? I mean,

52:29.520 --> 52:33.640
France was in a situation of emergency. So like the 1970s at

52:33.640 --> 52:37.880
the time of like the big oil price shocks and like France is a

52:37.880 --> 52:44.080
country without significant domestic energy supply. So they

52:44.080 --> 52:48.880
were extremely exposed to the oil price shocks. And at the same

52:48.880 --> 52:51.200
time, they were already in nuclear power, right? Like they

52:51.200 --> 52:53.760
kind of have like nuclear expertise, very centralized

52:53.760 --> 52:57.280
government. So yeah, they essentially decided, okay,

52:57.280 --> 53:00.200
we're gonna build nuclear as like a national project, and that

53:00.200 --> 53:03.680
kind of standardized it like one of like, both the same kind of

53:03.680 --> 53:08.200
reactor, both the workforce in a very centralized fashion, if

53:08.200 --> 53:11.680
you kind of compare this to the US, for example, where like

53:11.680 --> 53:14.720
utilities are kind of really spread out across the country,

53:14.720 --> 53:19.120
and like we're like, essentially, there's like not

53:19.120 --> 53:21.600
someone who's buying like 100 nuclear plants, right? There's

53:21.600 --> 53:25.840
kind of utilities that are buying like one reactor, or maybe

53:25.840 --> 53:28.160
two reactors and one plant or something like that, right? So

53:28.160 --> 53:31.320
like, the way that this happens was like fundamentally,

53:31.760 --> 53:34.040
fundamentally different. So these were very special

53:34.520 --> 53:37.520
circumstances. And like, just to be very clear, I'm not

53:37.520 --> 53:40.680
suggesting that those are transferable to today, right? Like

53:40.680 --> 53:44.120
it's not that the kind of shock or stress that France was under,

53:44.120 --> 53:46.960
it's not something we can replicate and say, oh, we're all

53:47.000 --> 53:50.440
we're all gonna build like to 80% nuclear in like 15 years,

53:50.880 --> 53:53.280
because of climate change, most countries are not able to do

53:53.280 --> 53:56.080
that. Like, technologically, they are, but like politically

53:56.080 --> 53:58.480
speaking, it doesn't seem feasible.

53:58.920 --> 54:03.600
Do you think we we need to develop new designs for nuclear

54:03.600 --> 54:09.240
reactors? Do we need to move to better designs? Do we need a

54:09.240 --> 54:13.120
molten salt reactors or something like this? Or are the

54:13.120 --> 54:15.120
reactor designs we have today enough?

54:15.320 --> 54:18.120
And this is, I think, an active debate in the like, in the

54:18.120 --> 54:22.640
nuclear community. And I think like, it kind of depends on how

54:22.680 --> 54:26.320
how do we define need in this context, right? So like, I

54:26.320 --> 54:29.080
think, from purely technical perspective, right, there's

54:29.080 --> 54:34.640
nothing wrong with existing nuclear power plants. So what's

54:34.640 --> 54:36.720
wrong is kind of like when the fact that we're not able to

54:36.720 --> 54:39.840
build them is kind of lack of societal commitment and like,

54:40.640 --> 54:42.640
lack of learning and stuff like that, right? So like, we can

54:42.680 --> 54:46.600
imagine a future where we built a lot of that. So the question

54:46.600 --> 54:51.200
is, can we actually get into that future? The most significant

54:51.200 --> 54:53.760
benefit of kind of advanced nuclear, like small, small

54:53.760 --> 54:59.080
modular reactors is essentially, it seems more plausible that

54:59.080 --> 55:01.800
this is kind of like, like, or there are countries where it

55:01.800 --> 55:04.280
seems more plausible that we're going to build lots of small

55:04.280 --> 55:08.120
modular reactors, because you can produce them and factories,

55:08.120 --> 55:11.360
you can essentially exploit the same learning curve dynamics

55:11.400 --> 55:13.920
that made renewables and electric cars and all other kind of

55:13.920 --> 55:16.960
technologies that we were able to make cheap cheap. So that's

55:16.960 --> 55:20.760
kind of another aspect. And it's also kind of playing much

55:20.760 --> 55:24.240
better with like renewable dominated grid. So it's kind of

55:24.240 --> 55:27.520
more flexible. And it's also like a smaller, smaller unit. So I

55:27.520 --> 55:31.640
think there, yeah, I think, I mean, we are like philanthropically

55:31.640 --> 55:34.400
speaking, we are we are betting on advanced nuclear or small

55:34.400 --> 55:37.920
modular reactors. But I wouldn't say it's necessarily related

55:37.960 --> 55:41.840
to like, technological problem with existing reactors is more

55:41.840 --> 55:45.280
like, yeah, the whole, yeah, yes, one of the themes here, it's

55:45.280 --> 55:48.680
not only about technology, it's about the whole like, societal

55:48.680 --> 55:51.160
kind of apparatus around the technology.

55:51.280 --> 55:54.360
And so the small modular reactors would be easier to

55:54.360 --> 55:57.320
innovate on because you would you would be able to develop one

55:57.320 --> 56:00.760
such reactor and deploy it and get feedback much, much more

56:00.760 --> 56:04.720
quickly than you can with a with a larger reactor, where it might

56:04.720 --> 56:09.280
take 15 years for it to to be built. And only then can you go

56:09.280 --> 56:12.680
back and think about what you could have done differently. Is

56:12.680 --> 56:15.360
it also a question of potentially you can you can mass

56:15.360 --> 56:18.000
produce these small modular reactors? What are the

56:18.000 --> 56:18.840
advantages here?

56:18.960 --> 56:21.520
So like it is the mass production, right, the mass

56:21.520 --> 56:25.160
production in a factory. So it's not only the 15 year thing,

56:25.160 --> 56:27.200
right, like under ideal circumstances, you could also

56:27.200 --> 56:29.360
build a large plant and something like four or six years,

56:29.360 --> 56:32.000
like you could also learn something from large plants,

56:32.000 --> 56:35.720
and you could build the same plant design over and over

56:35.720 --> 56:39.800
again. But it's much easier to learn. And like, obviously, it's

56:39.800 --> 56:42.920
like a controlled production environment, right? So like when

56:42.920 --> 56:45.160
kind of most of the reduction happens in a factory, I mean,

56:45.440 --> 56:48.040
obviously, some of the assembly has to happen on site, but like,

56:48.520 --> 56:52.160
that is where you can really kind of expect a high learning

56:52.160 --> 56:55.600
rates, right? So that's kind of, yeah, essentially, applying the

56:55.600 --> 56:59.360
same mechanism by which we make, make other kind of

56:59.360 --> 57:02.840
technologies cheap to the nuclear case.

57:03.440 --> 57:07.680
One last technology I want to run through is geothermal. This is

57:07.680 --> 57:11.120
something that's maybe like hydro, it's potentially a bit

57:11.120 --> 57:15.880
overlooked. But yeah, how promising do you think geothermal

57:15.880 --> 57:16.520
energy is?

57:16.760 --> 57:19.880
So I would say much more promising than hydro. But I think

57:19.880 --> 57:22.920
also, geopharmals definitely having a moment right now, and

57:22.920 --> 57:25.520
it's becoming radically less overlooked. There's traditional

57:25.520 --> 57:28.800
geothermal, which is kind of great, but it's very location

57:28.800 --> 57:31.520
specific, right? So you're low location dependent, you kind of

57:31.520 --> 57:33.800
do it, build it in lots of places, because you kind of need

57:34.520 --> 57:36.720
essentially not, yeah, you need kind of good conditions, you

57:36.720 --> 57:40.920
need like, yeah, close to volcano, etc. So like, essentially,

57:40.920 --> 57:44.520
you need to be closer to heat source near in the ground. And

57:44.520 --> 57:48.000
then there's kind of like different forms of like advanced

57:48.080 --> 57:51.600
geothermal. And that's a little bit like, there's like lots of

57:51.600 --> 57:55.360
different ones, it's like six or seven different ones. But I

57:55.360 --> 57:58.240
guess the one that we've been focusing on traditionally is

57:58.240 --> 58:01.600
what you would call ultra deep geothermal or like a super

58:01.600 --> 58:04.800
hot rock geothermal, where essentially, you're going so

58:04.800 --> 58:08.640
deep, that you can kind of make it much less location

58:08.640 --> 58:11.880
dependent, and also kind of get much, much warmer, what much

58:11.880 --> 58:15.320
hotter fuel, so you kind of get more, more energy density to

58:15.320 --> 58:18.040
get more favorable economics. And then that's kind of the idea

58:18.040 --> 58:22.400
of like, geothermal anywhere. So if you're kind of able to drill

58:22.400 --> 58:26.880
like, five kilometers or five down, yeah, that could be very

58:26.880 --> 58:29.520
promising. And that's kind of like, in general, this is not

58:29.520 --> 58:32.580
only true for super hot or ultra deep, but also kind of more

58:32.580 --> 58:36.360
generally for like innovations, you're formal. What this does,

58:36.360 --> 58:39.760
it's kind of leveraging the advances of the fracking of the

58:39.760 --> 58:43.960
Shea gas revolution, right? So like our ability to drill has

58:43.960 --> 58:47.000
been like, strongly increased through the through the fracking

58:47.000 --> 58:50.360
revolution and essentially applying this to to geothermal

58:50.760 --> 58:53.960
is kind of where a lot of the innovations coming from. And

58:53.960 --> 58:59.560
it's kind of very attractive, because once you make it work,

58:59.560 --> 59:02.480
right, you need to solve a couple of material science

59:02.480 --> 59:05.880
challenges here. But like, once those are solved, you have like

59:05.880 --> 59:09.120
a very mature labor force, and you kind of have like large

59:09.120 --> 59:12.320
economic interests, oil and gas, that will be quite

59:12.320 --> 59:16.600
interesting on that. So in that sense, it's kind of an innovation

59:16.640 --> 59:19.840
that is kind of locked in, if you will, right? So like, it's kind

59:19.840 --> 59:21.040
of not locked out, like

59:22.760 --> 59:26.000
Yeah, but if we're talking about drilling five kilometers down,

59:26.000 --> 59:29.080
this is not something you could do in in a person's backyard. So

59:29.080 --> 59:33.080
this is not as decentralized as for example, setting up solar

59:33.080 --> 59:36.720
panels on a on a roof in a residential neighborhood.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.160
No, it's solving the same problem that small modular

59:40.160 --> 59:43.360
reactors or like other kind of clean firm sources will solve,

59:43.360 --> 59:46.880
right? So it's not this is not about everyone having a super

59:46.920 --> 59:51.080
hot rock thing in their backyard. But this is about solving the

59:51.080 --> 59:54.640
hard part of electricity decarbonization, which is kind of

59:54.640 --> 59:57.920
clean firm resources, right? So like, not intermittent

59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.640
renewables, but something that can be dispatched and it can be

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.320
used the entire time.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.880
I guess technically, this is not a renewable form of energy,

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:10.320
but in a, in a kind of practical sense, it will take

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.200
billions of years for the earth's heat to dissipate enough for

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.440
this technology not not to work. So in practical terms, it's

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.160
it's renewable.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.160
Yeah, in practical terms, I think the distinction renewable and

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.440
not doesn't matter because I mean, renewables also require lots

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.080
of non renewables, like resources to like, like, right, like in a

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.440
way, so like the minerals that you need for like solar and wind

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.120
and so like, so yeah, it's, it's not a, it's not a practical

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.040
thing to worry about. But nor nor should you kind of worry

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.200
about uranium running out or stuff like that.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.440
Okay, we've, we've done an overview of a lot of the

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.760
technological options we have. If you were to to rank these

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.360
technologies and think about, you know, a plan for how we might

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.920
solve climate climate change using a combination of them. Where

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.600
would you where do you see most promise in the short term and in

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.200
the long term?

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.960
I mean, in the short term, it's very clear that like intermittent

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.400
renewables and natural gas will like do most of the like heavy

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.680
lifting and decarbonization in the near future. So like, because

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.160
they are quick to build and they're kind of quickly expanding

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.560
right and like, okay, in some places also adding nuclear

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.640
capacity, and also many other places like not prematurely

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.880
shutting down nuclear capacity, right? So like, yeah, so those

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.800
are I think kind of the short term and then hydropower, the

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.240
short term options. And the medium runs something like, well,

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.840
like advances in geothermal or advances in small modular

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.160
reactors, right, could kind of address what right now is kind

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.680
of a little bit of the Achilles heel of kind of electricity

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.920
decarbonization, which is kind of clean for power, right? So like

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.000
that's kind of why those are still important and like worth

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.080
doing, even though like renewables right now are cheap,

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.840
and there's kind of this like seduction of like only relying

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.360
on existing technologies. But like, the reason to not do that

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.040
is like the risk that we talked about before, but also kind of

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.800
the energy system function of like clean firm, which right now

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.600
is kind of not adequately solved. And when you say clean

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.760
firm, what do you mean? Well, so clean, right, means like zero

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.480
emissions and like zero air pollution and like otherwise

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.840
clean. So like that includes nuclear that includes geothermal

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:30.680
that includes fusion. If it were, if it were to happen. And firm

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.880
here means that it's essentially it is not an intermittent

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.160
resource, right? It's kind of not like solar and wind that is

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:43.280
kind of so yeah, it can in principle be run 24 seven. And

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.160
you will not use it for electricity 24 seven, but you

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.280
might use it for for producing hydrogen at other times of the

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.200
day. But like, yeah, essentially, that you're reducing what

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.280
storage kind of needs to do, right? Like it's becomes a lot

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:00.280
like building an energy system that has like clean firm

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.360
resources in it, like it's a lot more realistic to get to like

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.080
100% kind of clean than if you're kind of entirely batting

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.720
on intermittent resources.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.520
Yeah, so you think thinking across the different climate

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.160
scenarios, it's a it will be smart strategy for us to also

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.320
invest in some of these clean firm technologies and not just

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.480
traditional renewables like wind and solar.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.800
Okay, yeah, so I think it's kind of worth distinguishing two

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.280
separate strands of the argument here, even on kind of a normal

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.160
kind of trajectory where renewables are very successful,

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.160
like clean firm is kind of a useful compliment, right? And it

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.520
makes the overall system more efficient, it kind of like reduces

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:49.040
the like the necessity to like overbuild intermittent renewables

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.400
reduces the necessity of storage, etc. Right. So like, the case

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.760
for clean firms not entirely like hedging one, but then there's

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.480
also kind of the hedging one, which is like, I think we talked

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.360
about this before, right? Like, if we kind of wake up in 2040,

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.000
and like, our situation looks much worse than we're thinking

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.240
now, like, what has gone wrong? Well, one of the main things

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.640
that could have gone wrong is that like expanding solar and

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.080
wind was much hotter. And in that sense, investments in and

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:20.720
clean firm are like a hedge against that. And there's a key

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.360
fact of like climate that makes the hedging quality important.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.000
And that's essentially like the shape of climate damage. So that

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
climate damage to kind of like, or our expectation of like how

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.160
climate damage looks like is that it's kind of strongly

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.480
nonlinear. So like, world with six degrees is like much worse

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.320
than twice as bad than a world of three degrees and the world

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.600
with three degrees much worse than twice as bad than 1.5

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.080
degrees. So it's kind of particularly important, right? I

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.560
mean, you need to control for how likely those are. But like,

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.320
it's like, even if you kind of control for how likely there

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.880
are, it's kind of important to like, favor solutions that work

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.200
in situations where a lot of damage is. So those are kind of

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.000
right now, I would say those little worlds kind of more

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.120
reflect 2.5 degrees like 2.5 to 3.5, like those are reasonably

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.320
likely and reasonably more damaging than the worst cases

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.080
that I kind of take a lot of the expected damage and the

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.040
function. And under those, like if you're in those

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.320
situations, right, you kind of, you know, something,

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.960
probabilistically speaking, you know, you know, something that

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.360
is likely to have happened in those worlds. Like one thing

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.720
is likely to have happened is that renewables will have like,

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.280
yeah, been more curtailed than we expect.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.680
Okay, and I think we'll discuss this more later, thinking

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.520
about different climate scenarios and where we should spend our

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.160
money in, to kind of cover all scenarios. But before we get

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.200
there, I want to talk about some governmental options. What

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.040
could governments do in order to help this situation? You

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.800
mentioned before how European governments and California was

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.960
able to subsidize renewables to such an extent that they are

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.080
now quite cheap. In general, what's your sense of how well

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.480
subsidies work? Would you recommend that governments try

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.400
to pick out which which energy technologies they favor and then

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400
subsidize those?

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.120
The broad answer to which Mrs. Canter relates to like, what is

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.200
what, how good is the government at picking winners and

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.680
like, how far should the government pick winners? I think

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.680
like, the broad answer is here, like, the government was

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.800
heavily involved in every kind of important technological

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.840
success when it comes to energy and climate, and also like

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.480
heavily involved in lots of different failures. So like on

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.840
the success, right, we have like solar, we have electric cars,

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.880
we have wind, we have nuclear, we have fracking. On the failure,

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.720
we have stuff like cylindra, we have stuff like biofuels in the

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.720
US, which are like subsidized because they're kind of big in

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.840
Iowa and Iowa is important for presidential elections. Like, so

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.720
like, you have like the good, the bad and the ugly kind of all

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.360
all together, right? So like, that's important, right? It's

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.600
like, it's not, there's essentially no example of

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.760
like energy technology transformation that kind of where

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.840
government has not played a huge role. So I think that that's

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:14.280
something worth, like worth remembering kind of to start. And

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:19.280
it's also there's no because there's no clear example where

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.120
essentially technology has been an energy technology has been

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:27.880
brought about primarily by market forces, right? So like, so

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.320
like there's demonstration projects, those are often

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.440
public or like at least publicly, partially publicly

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.000
funded. Then there's kind of about this basic R&D where like

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.640
government also plays a big role demonstration projects. And

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.360
there's kind of like early procurement policies like across

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.680
the entire chain of the environment of the innovation

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:51.080
process government plays a huge role. And I think there isn't

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:54.720
really an alternative to this or like we haven't really

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.720
observed an alternative to this. So I think the view that I

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.880
would kind of house like in general kind of government is

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.920
much better than its reputation. Because like once electric cars

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.320
get cheap, then we're all celebrating Elon Musk, but we're

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.680
like forgetting the fact that like, there's like huge electric

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.120
car subsidies that like may Tesla possible, right? Like, and I

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.240
mean, there's a similar story, like not to pick on Elon Musk,

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.280
right? There's a similar story for like most other kind of

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.480
technological successes. At the end, there's kind of a private

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.000
company that's kind of doing the last mile, that's getting a

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.920
lot of the attention. But like before, or even at that last

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.160
stage, there's huge, huge involvement by the government. So

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.680
I think that's that's what I can say to, to start. So government

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.280
will make mistakes. But I think the alternative is not to not

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:42.960
let the government pick. Ideally, and I think that's what we're

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.880
kind of seeing in the United States right now. You're

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:51.240
essentially trying to support technology at the right, at the

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.640
right level, right? So like, you shouldn't choose all

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.920
technologies. And you should also like be humble in terms of

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.040
like, you cannot pick all the winners. But right now, if you

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.320
look at the the inflation reduction act, and the

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.240
infrastructure bill selected to major pieces of kind of climate

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.920
policy change in the United States are now, they're

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.280
essentially like very broad, that's unlike lots of different

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.440
technologies. And they're very kind of on the one hand, like

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.680
then an infrastructure bill like R&D driven, in the case of the

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.120
inflation reduction act more like subsidy and later stage

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.120
technology driven, like, I guess they're a very strong form of

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.680
government involvement. But in a way, they're taking a lot of

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.040
winners, or like some of them will not be winners, right? So

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.640
like, they're, they're kind of very, very broad on their, their

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.680
approach to their credit.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.880
And do you think that's the right strategy to subsidize or to

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.600
support from the government side across the right range of

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.600
technologies and across different stages of technological

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.120
development?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.720
So if we're saying that history is informative, then I think

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.280
that's kind of what history teaches us about like innovation

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.200
and energy. Yes.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.680
Are there any research and development into one of the

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.240
the forms of energy technology we talked about that you think

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.000
the government should spend more money on? Should the

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.400
government be subsidizing at a later stage of development, some

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.360
of these technologies?

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.840
So like, I guess the contextualized the moment that

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.000
we're in, right? So like we're in, well, mid 20 or mid to late

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.880
2023, and like, both in the United States, and to a lesser

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.120
degree also in Europe, like we've seen like major climate

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.680
policies over the last year, right? So like, like in the, in

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.800
the United States was focused on that case, right? So like the

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.560
inflation reduction act was passed, like essentially almost

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:34.600
exactly a year ago, a year before the infrastructure was

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.240
passed. Like both of those are kind of like, putting support

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.080
for clean energy, essentially on a whole order of magnitude,

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.880
kind of different levels. So we're now subsidizing or the

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.880
inflation reduction act, we're going to subsidize renewable,

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.920
like only renewables, clean energy, and other kind of

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.280
clean technologies on the order of like, 300 billion, at least

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.880
and could go, could go, could go higher than this. We are in a

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:02.480
situation where like, money is not the primary constraint right

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:06.720
now, for most kind of energy innovation, or it's kind of

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.960
like, it's much more harder to make that case, right? Like,

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.960
that doesn't mean we're in a situation where everything is

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.520
kind of going great, right? It's more that kind of the

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.280
challenges maybe more like stuff like permitting reform, or

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.360
kind of making those demonstration projects

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:23.480
happening, or like, in the case of nuclear reforming the nuclear

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.680
regulatory commission. So it's not so much about money being

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.600
the limiting constraint that and like, for the second part of

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.880
the question, should they support at a later stage? Yes,

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.640
absolutely. So I think the basic, the basic problem in the

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:43.280
discourse, I think is that there's relatively broad support

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.520
for like, basic research and development, right, like support

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.080
for that is kind of very kind of mainstream, right, like lots of

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.920
conservatives will kind of support investment and basic,

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.320
basic R&D, because there's a very clear market failure there,

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.680
it's very well recognized. So it's kind of very bipartisan, or

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.520
at least there's kind of like a broad kind of set of people

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.840
that will support that. But like the like the area where most

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.600
failure happens kind of in the later stages is kind of like

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.800
getting 100 million for a demonstration project. So that's

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.080
something that historically in the United States, for example,

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.000
has been hard to kind of get political buy-in to fund this

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.200
work, right? Because it's also like, when you fail, you fail

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.600
very recently, right? So like Mitt Romney in 2012, like started

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.640
his campaign at the Solyndra plan, right? Like Solyndra being

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.400
like kind of the example of the failure of kind of the clean

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.040
energy investments of the Obama administration. So maybe, maybe

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.120
explain what happened there. I'm not familiar with the, is it

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.320
called Solyndra?

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.960
Yeah, so like Solyndra was kind of like an advanced solar company

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:50.360
that kind of was kind of heavily supported by the American

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.920
Reinvestment Act, so kind of the small scale version of what

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.920
Biden did now, like enlarge with inflation reduction act, kind

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.880
of like so the recovery after honey, 18, the clean energy

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.360
spending there. And Solyndra was kind of a very, very public

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.760
failure of a company that was kind of heavily backed by the

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.880
government. And yeah, essentially became the symbol of

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.960
like, okay, the government is really bad at picking winners,

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.440
right? And like, that kind of happened. At the same time as

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.920
kind of the shale gas revolution was playing out, right?

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.560
We're like, also the government had kind of played a big, big

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.760
role in supporting that. So it's just like, we're very selective

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.640
and like picking our examples.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.200
What do you think about carbon taxes? This is a solution to

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.480
climate change that's often favored by economists, where

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.680
you you simply price the negative externality of

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.920
emissions, and then you let the market figure out how to

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.240
implement the how to reduce emissions. Do you think carbon

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.720
taxes could work? So and I guess I mentioned this in the

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.360
beginning, but just just to recap. So before I joined

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.480
founder slash, I spent five years working on carbon pricing

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.680
emission trading system, carbon taxes. So I'm very familiar

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.280
with those debates. I mean, I think they can work. But I think

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.280
they will not play, like a major role in kind of the solution.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.760
And just like to give a couple of, couple of like arguments,

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.800
why? So if you're like thinking again about kind of the

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.240
example of like solar, and how solar got cheap. So the

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.000
subsidies that kind of Germany was able to kind of that were

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.240
politically feasible in the early 2000s in Germany. You could

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.960
have achieved them with a carbon tax between like 700 to 900

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.240
something in that range, dollars per ton. That's an

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.120
insanely high carbon tax. So like at that point, most of the

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.760
world had no carbon taxes at all, right, like Germany had no

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.760
carbon tax at all, like the only kind of countries having

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.840
carbon taxes for like, Scandinavian countries. And like

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.960
even then, like the highest carbon tax will be something like

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:57.400
$50 a ton, right? So like, the really kind of transformative

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.560
price signal that you need to like drive an immature

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.400
technology, you will probably never get where the carbon tax

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.600
that's politically feasible, right? Like you could not, it's

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.720
not that you could have had the carbon tax at that level at that

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.040
time. So I think that's kind of one reason, right? And now we're

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.120
essentially like now we're essentially this situation where

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.560
like solar were kind of the difference to the fossil fuel

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.000
alternative was kind of zero in many cases, right? You wouldn't

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.640
need a carbon tax. Essentially, to solve climate change, you need

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.240
fundamental technological transformation. And for that, you

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.520
need like very, very strong push and you cannot get this kind of

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.720
push with a with a politically feasible price. So that's kind

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.600
one constraint. And the other constraint is kind of the

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:50.800
international situation. So if you were in a situation where you

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.560
would have a global carbon tax, right, like maybe or a global

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.600
kind of carbon price, maybe that would be enough to kind of

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.560
induce some some innovation, etc. But like, you never, like,

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:06.640
it's very far, very far from getting there. So I think right

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.360
now we're in a situation where it's very clear that the most

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.480
significant things that like individual countries can do, like

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.720
in a situation where international coordination is

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.320
relatively weak, are not about kind of introducing a carbon

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:25.880
tax, like had Germany introduced the carbon tax in 2005,

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.040
this would have or sorry, in 2005, we got the emission

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.800
trading system. So let's say if we had like introduced like

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.720
reasonably high carbon prices early in the 2000s, would have

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.440
kind of accelerated like transition from like German

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.160
coal to Russian gas, that would have been the main effect

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.360
would not have had like transformative effects,

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.240
globally speaking, right? So like, that's, I think, the really

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:53.080
big constraint there. So essentially, yeah, carbon

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:59.040
taxes might play a role. Once all technologies are reasonably

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.120
close to competitiveness, and then kind of iron out a little

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.360
bit on the on the margin. But I guess that that's kind of like

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.080
not not the point where it really matters anymore.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.480
Yeah, and just just to check with you, what do you what do you

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:18.160
think about planting trees? Is that with that work at all? Is

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.720
that on the kind of what would that have a large enough effect

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.320
to matter? You sometimes hear claims about the importance of

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:33.680
the Amazon rainforest, for example, as a way of decreasing

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:38.960
CO2 in the atmosphere, could the government initiate a large

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.640
kind of projects of planting more forest for that work?

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.040
So I mean, in principle, the easier thing had should always be

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.400
avoiding deforestation, because planting trees to like to have

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.000
a carbon effect, right, like it takes 20 years. It's not

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.160
instantaneously useful. I mean, I guess, I guess to start with

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.520
again, now we kind of need to refocus on, we're talking here

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.040
on the margin. And when we talk about trees, everyone loves

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.560
trees. Like the person I meet the most, like the superficial

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.080
kind of climate person I meet the most, right? Like the first

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.600
like, they want to like they want to plant trees, like that's

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.240
the first thing that essentially everyone kind of coming into

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.520
this conversation jumps to.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.400
Yeah, this is exactly why I brought it up, because I'm

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.320
guessing that this proposal would be extremely popular with a

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.520
kind of broad public and maybe that itself, even though planting

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.040
trees may may not be the most effective thing. Just the fact

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.720
that it's so popular might mean that it's it's easier to

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.280
implement. And that could be an argument for it.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.360
Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, you would need to do a certain

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.240
insane scale. But so if you if we're thinking about the kind of

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.320
the existing solution on this base, which is essentially about

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.320
like rainforest protection, right? And like there we have kind

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.920
of an international carbon market around protecting rain

01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.200
forests, like called web plus. And the basic idea there is like

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:08.840
you're rewarding countries for avoiding deforestation. So and

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.000
like the most significant example of this is like between

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.520
Norway and Brazil, where like Norway kind of tried to like pay

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.800
Brazil lots of money to kind of like, yeah, save kind of like

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.360
deforest less. And the problem with that is I think

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.920
fundamentally that you're rewarding something you can't

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.760
observe, like you're rewarding counterfactual, like you're

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.240
rewarding, of additionally avoided deforestation, which is

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.520
not something you can observe, right? So like your and so like

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.840
that is kind of hard on the best case. And it's like,

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.800
essentially impossible when you have like sovereign nation states

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.440
that all can kind of have their own, their own estimates. So

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.680
that's one of the problems. And the other problem, of course,

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:57.160
is kind of a snot. Like the main benefit of like avoiding

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.880
deforestation comes from the long term again, right? So like,

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:04.160
but you can't really have like credible, credible commitments

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.160
over like decades in terms of protecting trees. So like it's

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:12.120
a solution that like looks seductively simple, but kind of

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.640
in practice, kind of doesn't work. Yeah, so like that's kind of

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.880
the case for avoiding deforestation and for planting

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.600
trees. Yeah, I mean, you need to do those on an extremely

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.600
massive scale. And like, it's not going to have large effects

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.920
kind of in the, in the short term.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.720
Yeah, are there any other non technological options that you

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:33.960
like, or that you find promising?

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.120
There's lots of other things we can do, right? So like, I think

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.840
one thing that we should talk about briefly would be climate

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.240
finance. So which is essentially the idea of like

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.560
incentivizing lower income countries for like building or

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.000
like paying essentially paying more clean energy

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.800
infrastructure. Yeah, in principle, that's one of the

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.240
things that you would expect if we had a global carbon market,

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.160
right? Because like abating abating emissions should be

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.040
cheaper in a lower income country. So that's another

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.760
approach of kind of a software from many of the problems I've

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.400
now talked about with regards to with regards to rainforest

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:13.320
protection. So that's another approach that I think we should

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:16.640
mention. And then there's kind of when you're kind of in a

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.080
situation where you have a lot of growth happening, right? So if

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.160
you're kind of an emerging Asia right now, there is a lot of

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.560
variance and like how emission intensive that growth can be. So

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.040
like we've just hired a carbon looking specialist who like she

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.480
will kind of look at what what are the interventions we can do

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:38.040
there. But like if you kind of look at the literature, you can

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.440
kind of see like clear differences related to, yeah,

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:45.240
like how our city is being built and these kind of things like

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:49.360
kind of shape essentially shaping long run behavioral

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.160
patterns by like different forms of infrastructure

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.360
investments.

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.080
Yeah, and you mentioned supporting innovation or

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:58.280
innovation policy.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.000
And that's kind of ties to what we've talked about before,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.960
right, which is like, the government is essential for

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.720
technological transformation. What the government does can be

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.160
affected by advocacy, you can kind of fund through like where

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.520
you can find a charity to do this kind of work. And it is it

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.720
locks it kind of souls for this like what I described is like

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.200
the central conundrum of climate policy, right, that kind of

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.720
essentially the gas that you have like way more leverage through

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.720
innovation on like global emission outcomes than like

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.720
through their territorial emissions. So you have this

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.760
potential for trajectory changing dynamics, right, that we've

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.720
kind of been discussing with the example of solar electric cars

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.600
et cetera that relatively small changes in the world, like in

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.640
the large in the grand scheme of things, right, like California

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.360
aggressively supporting electric cars or Denmark aggressively

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:58.160
supporting wind power, these are like small changes on the world

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.960
but like huge long term consequences. So I think that's

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.280
kind of the thing and like the other things that I would

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:09.560
mention, so like kind of on the on the carbon carbon lock inside

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:14.040
would be stuff like, yeah, essentially regulatory reform,

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.680
right. And the US this would be something like permitting

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.400
reform, which which will become like a hot issue or is already

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.480
becoming a hot issue because the financing for clean energy is

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:28.840
there but the permits and the regulation is not there. And

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.400
they're similar similar issues and like emerging emerging

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.920
economies. So it's not all about technological innovation, not

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.400
at all. Right. It's also about like, yeah, shaping the

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.800
regulatory frameworks, etc. And here you're using

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:49.040
some amount of money in order to influence a much bigger amount

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.440
of money. Basically, you're using philanthropic dollars to

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:56.040
influence the dollars or the money spent by governments.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.720
Yeah. So for everything that we're kind of funding and

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.000
there's always there's always kind of advocacy and the broader

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:07.680
sense of the term. So I'm kind of saying essentially, using

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.800
philanthropy to influence much larger budgets, right? And like

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:14.560
like that reasoning comes from the fact that like, all government

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.400
budgets are like several orders of magnitude, like two to three

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.560
orders of magnitudes, larger than philanthropy. And also, I

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.840
think what we've already touched on, right, like, there's

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.000
things that kind of essentially need the government, even if it's

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.200
like changing regulation, etc. Right. So like, most impact

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.240
focused philanthropy and climate is ultimately about kind of

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:38.120
shaping actions of the government, you know, or other large

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:38.920
actors.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.920
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I do wonder, though, aren't

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:47.000
there a lot of kind of interest groups trying to get the

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.400
government to spend money on on various things. And so you might

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.080
there might be a lot of competition for influence over

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.000
over the government's resources.

01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:00.200
When I just talked about like the different sizes of the

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:06.000
changes in the world, that kind of relates relates to this. So I

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.360
think that the best case or like the kind of the highest impact

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.360
case for like philanthropy to have like a large impact on

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.720
government policy is kind of in situations where there's like

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.240
relatively little attention, right? So like, if we're kind of

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:24.040
thinking about the counter example of like the carbon

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.160
tax, like needs national attention needs like bipartisan

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.040
support to be passed definitely needs national

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.960
conversation. Like that's probably a situation where like an

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.400
additional fund traffic dollar will not make a large difference

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.880
because kind of like lots of other money is involved. But when

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.800
you're kind of in a situation where like, you know, okay, we're

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.800
going to pass this big climate bill. And like, there's a big

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.160
national conversation about we want to do this, the climate

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:54.320
bill, but ultimately, like how exactly does this climate bill

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.400
look like, which technology does support and how that is kind of

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.280
a thing, the sweet spot for kind of philanthropy, right,

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.760
because we're essentially lots of political science literature

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.040
for like how this kind of works. It's what's called like

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.120
legislative subsidy. So there's kind of special charities that

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.440
kind of specialize and like knowing which legislation would

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.440
be needed to kind of promote a given technology or given

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.200
approach. And yeah, essentially providing providing that

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.000
knowledge to the policymakers. So I think that's kind of a way

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.720
in which in which charities can have a large influence and kind

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:34.640
of policy fields that are less politicized and that are kind

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.040
of like under, yeah, that are kind of not not not super not

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.120
super crowded. Yeah,

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.640
let's give an overview of the different climate scenarios. So

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.840
what's most likely to happen with the climate and specifically,

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.320
I think we should talk about the worst cases and how likely

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:51.840
those are.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.640
If you kind of look at the forecast, there's something like

01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.760
one third probability that we will kind of meet global climate

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.880
targets. So that would be like limiting warming to two degrees.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.840
Then there's kind of about another third for something

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.080
like between two, two and three degrees. And then there's kind

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.320
of another third for everything kind of above three degrees from

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.600
up to like five degrees. So this is kind of from a we can we can

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.640
link this in the show notes, but like that's kind of from an

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.840
from an LSE paper that kind of try to try to estimate those

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.360
last year. And but like, there's different ways to estimate

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.480
this, but it's kind of like broadly, broadly consistent. So

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:35.720
like, we're probably not in current trajectory is not going

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:39.160
to meet the global climate targets. We're gonna overshoot

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:44.600
them by a degree or so. At the same time, right, kind of the

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.280
really extreme scenarios, like six degrees or something like

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:51.640
that has become like, very, very significantly less likely

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.120
compared to what we believe like five or six years ago.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.880
Yeah, maybe you could describe some of the effects of the

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
these different degrees of heating. It's a bit abstract

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.400
when we're talking in terms of degrees, could you describe

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.200
some of the effects of different degrees of heating?

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.880
I mean, again, like this is of course an area where there's

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.680
always like huge uncertainties, right? So like, we're like, if

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.520
you look at the bars, like when do certain phenomena starts

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.800
is kind of always like, okay, this could start at two degrees,

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.720
because start at four and five degrees. I mean, the thing that

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.920
we're kind of like right now, we're kind of in a situation where

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.560
we can, where we can essentially see climate change in our

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.240
daily lives, right, where kind of the temperature extremes

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.720
have clearly changed. Also, like where like many, not all, but

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.160
like kind of many kind of natural disasters have a climate

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.080
change signal on there, right? So it kind of become more likely

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.440
or more intense related to climate change. So that's kind of

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:47.640
where we are right now. It's broadly kind of, I guess, probably

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:51.560
think these things have become more, more intense. Then if

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.240
you're kind of, I guess if you're hitting two degrees or more

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.240
than like tipping point, tipping points become somewhat more

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.680
likely. So there are elements in the climate system that either

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.160
would kind of have like local environment effects or like

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.560
dieback on the Amazon, for example, or kind of have like

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.320
global climate effects, like shifting global temperature up

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.600
by a half a degree or something of that sort. So those kind of

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.080
things become kind of become happening, happening more as we

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.400
moving higher up. Yeah, I think that's kind of the main thing.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.960
So I would say this is pretty abstract. The reason for that is

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.960
this is not really what I'm not really spending a lot of time on

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.720
that. I'm mostly interested, like, give them what I'm doing

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.520
day to day, I'm mostly interested in understanding the

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.440
shape of the curve, and how likely the different futures are

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.400
because that's kind of what's most relevant for me to prioritize.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.000
And so are you prioritizing the worst case scenarios?

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.880
No. And I'm really happy that you asked this because this is a

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:51.720
very typical misunderstanding. So what I'm essentially arguing for

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.560
and I will talk about this, which we can also link like on the

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.200
structure of climate risk and its implications for high

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.800
impact philanthropy. What I'm essentially asked arguing for is

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.520
we treat this the same that we will treat other problems. So

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.440
like, we're essentially looking at expected damage, right? So

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.560
like an expected damage is the product of two different things

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:16.920
is like the probability of different futures and how bad

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:23.840
those futures would be. And right now, most of the probability

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.920
mass, so when we put these things together, based on the

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.240
current estimates would be on the other side, I think, like

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.360
above, like most of the damage would be above 2.5 to 3.5. But

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.800
crucially, it would not be in like six degrees or more. Because

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.840
that's like, even though those worlds will be extremely

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.640
damaging, they've become so much less likely that they're so

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.920
that kind of the degree, like the low likelihood kind of

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.000
dominates the strength of the signal. So it's not about just

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.120
focusing on the worst world is kind of taking an expected

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:57.400
damage. And the alternative to this, that I'm criticizing is

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:01.480
essentially much of the focus of the climate community, where

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.640
it's like, black and white, like either we meet the goal of the

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:07.440
Paris Agreement or we don't, like there's all of this massive

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.440
complexity that you talked about. And we're just reducing it

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.960
to, okay, on a two degree trajectory, we will need this

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.160
and this and this. And like, that's kind of, I guess, in a way,

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.640
the wrong question. Where do you see the most expected damage

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.880
then? Yeah, so and the last time we ran these numbers, and we

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:25.760
should run them again this year. But like, it's kind of, I

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.800
think, in those worlds that are both reasonably likely, and

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.840
also much more like significantly more damaging

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.400
than kind of the best case worlds, right? So they will be like

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:39.400
worlds of like 2.5 to 3.5 degrees, roughly, that's kind of

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:44.680
where the bulk of the damages. So those are worlds where the

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.840
Paris Agreement has not succeeded, right? Because me, the

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.840
Paris Agreement's goal is to limit temperature to two

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:53.360
degrees. They're also like worlds where like, yeah, some

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:57.200
things must must clearly have gone wrong. They're also not

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:01.360
worlds like those worlds are not consistent with like, super

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:05.200
cheap renewables, easy seasonal storage, etc. Yeah.

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.000
Yeah. And in those worlds, what are the most promising

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.760
interventions to alleviate the expected damage?

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:17.480
The method here is, let's think about, because we're in a

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.520
situation of extreme uncertainty, about lots of

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.960
different things, like how much our economy is going to grow,

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.920
how carbon tensiles is going to be, how will different

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.400
technologies play out, how strong will the climate react? And

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.080
all of these things are highly uncertain. But we're trying to

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:36.200
understand, what do we know about the structure here? Like,

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:39.560
what do we know? What is more likely to be true in a worse

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.920
world, essentially? So like, on the technological level, or we

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.880
already talked about this, right? So like, okay, a typical,

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:50.040
like there's kind of two, two typical, or two, I think, failure

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.440
moods that people would expect. Like one is kind of like,

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.000
renewables do not scale as much. Another would kind of be that

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:01.080
electrification doesn't scale as much, right? So that's kind of

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:06.040
related. So if renewables don't scale as much, then like, the

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:09.120
clean firm power sources that we talked about, right, those are

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.920
kind of, we're gonna play a relatively larger role. So like,

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.240
a significant part of the motivation of like, investing in

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:19.880
geothermal, investing in advanced nuclear kind of comes not all

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:24.160
of it, but like, comes from that. There's of course, also like

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.960
other aspects to this, right? It's not only about the choice of

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.360
energy technology, it's also about like, different kinds of

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:36.600
solutions. So if you're kind of thinking about those futures,

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.160
like those are not futures, where, as a side, like, international

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.000
cooperation on climate, like being in a great shape is not

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.280
consistent with being in the 3.5 world. So that means that

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.440
things that kind of maybe look very good on the best case,

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.840
right? Like if the best case is kind of like the case that we're

01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.160
in right now, or probably even better, let's say, saving trees

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.560
on the Amazon, like, if we could kind of get this to work,

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.400
right? Like, even if that were very cheap, and the best case

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:11.560
where we solve this regulatory problem that so far, we were not

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.640
able to solve. Now, that's not going to work in this kind of

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:17.720
world, right? So, so, so that's, I think, something that's kind

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:21.280
of contraindicated on this case, right? So it's kind of like, this

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.120
will look worse. And similarly, if you kind of think about the

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.200
structure of the world economy, like, and kind of like the future

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.680
for predictions, you probably have like, more of the higher

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:36.600
warming worlds are like, in situations where like emerging

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:41.120
economies have been growing very strongly, right? So like, yeah,

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:44.320
we're making us like, let's say Africa is kind of growing, and

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.720
growing very strong. So it also tells us something about like,

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.640
regional prioritization, some level,

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:53.160
I think actually, that's, that's a great segue to where I would

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.440
like to, to, to end this conversation by talking about

01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:02.120
kind of interactions between climates and, and other areas we

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:06.080
could call them. What are the tradeoffs between economic

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.520
development and emissions?

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.040
Yeah, so that depends on where you are with regards to economic

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:17.320
development. So there's a very strong relationship between

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:21.720
economic development or human development more generally, and

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.960
use of energy. And that's like, not like a one direction

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.000
causation, right? So like, we shouldn't say like, more energy

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.440
causes more development. But we should say that it would be very

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.560
surprising that the world gets a lot richer without losing a lot

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:39.000
more energy. So I think that's very clear. And like, there's

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.760
papers on that that show this very clearly. And like, it's like

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.880
kind of really, really strong kind of relationship. And the

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.560
relationship is much, much stronger in the earlier part of

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.560
the ladder, right? So like, high income countries right now are

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.240
able to grow without growing their emissions, right? So there's

01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.360
like, about 20, 25 countries or so that have been able to grow

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.720
over the last decade, grow the GDP without growing their

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.400
emissions, what would be kind of like the, the weak kind of

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.600
condition of decoupling, right? It's kind of not doesn't mean

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.640
they will meet their climate goals, but it kind of means that

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:16.680
kind of growth is kind of possible without increasing

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:22.360
emissions. But that is not true on the, on the lower end, right?

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.360
And like, broadly for, for three reasons, if you're kind of

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.680
very energy poor, then like, so if you can kind of save more

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.560
energy, like energy efficiency gains, etc. will just use like

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.600
probably translate into into more energy use. I think that's

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:41.560
kind of one reason there's two other ones. So one is kind of

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.560
like earlier economic development is kind of more, more

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.120
carbon intensive, right? So it requires stuff like that

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:49.440
requires little steel and cement, the kind of stuff that's

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.760
kind of hard to decarbonize right now, or which we actually

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:56.600
have not decarbonized to this point at like, reasonable cost.

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:01.320
So that's kind of another aspect to this. Yeah, so that

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:04.560
essentially you're doing lots of infrastructure investments

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.320
that are very early. And of course, also like the willingness

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:12.200
to pay for climate policy is like, very low and rightly so very

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.960
low if you're not in a very energy poor context, right? If

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:17.880
you're in India and have like 400 million people without

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.600
access to electricity, then like the first thing that you're

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.920
thinking about is not implementing a carbon tax.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.280
And so we mentioned one very large benefit of using less oil

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.760
and coal, which is to add, which is a decrease in air

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.760
pollution. Do you think there are other additional benefits?

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:41.240
Here I'm thinking in terms of greater food stability or less

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.360
conflict or something like that?

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:47.400
I would call it the more sophisticated case about caring

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.640
about climate change is probably less about like extreme

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:54.040
weather events and the like the dire impacts of extreme weather

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.480
events, but more like political instability and conflict,

01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.560
especially in places that are heavily dependent on like, well,

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.120
environmental conditions, right, right? So if you kind of in

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:07.240
sub-Saharan Africa, and you have like rain-fed agriculture,

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.120
like that is probably the most likely case where you can get

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.240
social destabilization because of climate change, because

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:17.520
you're like the vulnerability is very high. So yeah, I think

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.680
that's kind of an important effect. This seems like very

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.480
important from like, like, ethically speaking, from a

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.600
perspective of like, okay, this is like climate change is

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.360
hurting the global poor the most. And like, it's kind of the

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.560
most destabilizing probably in those in those areas. So I think

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.000
that's a very important effect. And something that I think

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.920
effective altruists, it's easy for effective altruists to forget

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.160
that, because in a way, if you kind of think about climate as a

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:51.280
civilizational risk, I think I would agree that the civilizational

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.720
risk aspect of climate is kind of low, because it's kind of hard

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:59.000
to imagine a great power war because of climate change. And I

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.680
guess, like, if you're kind of caring about the long term

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.200
future, like great power wars are just like, extraordinarily

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.440
important. But kind of from the from the more near term suffering

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.760
perspective, like, I think that's a very significant effect.

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:16.920
And another one that comes more from essentially making clean

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:20.360
energy cheap, right, is kind of thought like reducing energy

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:23.040
poverty. So I just, I just mentioned, like, I guess 400

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.800
million people in India, not having access to electricity,

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:30.320
right? So like, we're living in a world where like, what we are

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.120
thinking about first when we're reducing emissions, right, like

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.960
we can use we can all use a lot less energy, without like,

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.040
sacrificing a lot of our living standards. But we're not living

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.240
in a globally representative part of the world. Both of us and I

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.600
think most listeners. So it's kind of a very different

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.240
situation, like the average human on this planet is like very

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:55.000
energy poor and like, we're the human development benefits of

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.760
access to more energy are very significant. Yeah, so and ideally

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:02.760
if it's quite clean and cheap energy, that's the ideal, ideal

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:03.200
case.

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.560
Yeah, that's a great point. Your Highness, thanks for coming on

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.320
the podcast. It's been a real pleasure. Thanks for sharing

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:10.240
your knowledge with us.

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:11.840
Yeah, thank you so much.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:13.640
Great to be here.
