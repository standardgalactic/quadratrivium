{"text": " Welcome to the Future of Life Institute podcast. My name is Gus Docker and I'm here with Johannes Aquar. Johannes is a researcher at Founders Pledge where he leads the Climate Change Fund. Johannes, welcome to the podcast. Thanks so much for having me, Gus. Great to be here. I'm a big fan of the Future of Life Institute. And yeah, happy to talk all things climate today. Perhaps we could start with your role at Founders Pledge. What is it that you do there? How do you how do you see your role? Yeah, so I think the way I usually describe it is like my goal and the goal of my team is kind of to like find and fund kind of the highest impact opportunities and climate and those are like philanthropic opportunities, right? So like things where we can wear a million dollars or something in the quarter of magnitude can kind of make a difference by supporting initiatives that are like extremely promising. And yeah, as you mentioned, kind of in the beginning, right? So there's kind of the climate fund, which kind of puts this to life, the Founders Pledge Climate Fund, but also we're advising kind of, I know for individuals kind of beyond that and kind of trying to, yeah, trying to identify using research and using privatization research, kind of to identify where where are the biggest blind spot, what are the blind spot generating mechanisms, if you will, and kind of what does that mean for what you should fund on a margin as an ex philanthropist? Yeah, and I think that word is the key. So thinking on the margin here, I see your job, or I think that that your job is about thinking about the marginal dollar, where is that dollar best spent? Would that be the correct frame? Yes, the next dollar or the next million dollar. And I think that's like really, really crucial frame, because I think a lot of the things that I am going to be saying is going to be like, controversial, and might be wrong. If like, if one would interpret them as unlike, this is all we should be doing. And that's, I'm not really talking about this is all we should be doing. I'm talking about like, at the margin, this is what we should be doing relatively, relatively more off. Yeah, we're going to get into a broad overview of the whole climate change issue. We're going to look at all the potential technologies or government options that might help us alleviate this problem. But I think we should start with your personal journey as an environmentalist. So how did you end up in this role? Where did you start? When did you first become interested in the climate? So, I mean, I grew up in the 90s in Germany, so it was very easy to kind of become an environmentalist, I think. So kind of in my, I remember, like some of my first childhood memories kind of being very interested in saving the tigers as like inventing a board game, save the Siberian tiger kind of like, like, yeah, there was a, an animal documentary on like three times a week and like the last five or 10 minutes of the documentary would always be like, okay, and now humans are destroying this beautiful nature, right? So that that was kind of, I think, very big part of kind of, yeah, of this, of this, I think, initial, initial education, or becoming an environmentalist. And I guess I got more serious about this kind of, yeah, in my, in my teenage years, when I was like an environmental activist for the German chapter of Friends of the Earth, and kind of like, protesting President Bush to sign the Kyoto Protocol when he was visiting this kind of stuff. So that's kind of where it started. And then I kind of when I came to to university, I think the idea for me was, okay, let's kind of study social sciences with a focus on like understanding what's kind of what kind of makes climate policies successful. So that's kind of what I spent kind of my studies on. And then I was working afterwards, for, for a think tank in Germany for five years, kind of working on carbon pricing. And that's kind of, ultimately, after this kind of joint joint foundry pledge kind of went into philanthropy. So that's kind of the story. Yeah. And what's something you've changed your mind about? Where where have you gotten new ideas or learned new facts that kind of changed your priorities? I mean, lots, lots and lots over the years, right? So that was kind of like a very short introduction to like a 20 year journey. I think the first big change probably in college kind of. So at that point, I was kind of, yeah, very strongly kind of, yeah, as I said, like influenced by the environmental movement kind of was kind of card carrying environmentalist, if you will. And essentially, at that point, kind of, yeah, as I said, I was kind of studying social science or kind of focusing on political culture and understanding in a way that like the things that I believed or the kind of people like me would believe about how to solve the climate change, right? So like, heavily focused on renewables, heavily focused on energy efficiency, heavily focused on lifestyle change, being anti nuclear being somewhat skeptical of technological innovation, right? That essentially, all of those beliefs kind of fit together kind of in a very systematic fashion, right? And what unites them is not that they're kind of an adequate response to the climate challenge, what unites them is that they're kind of part of a specific ideology and this kind of this case kind of like a kind of egalitarian green ideology, which kind of is framing a large part of the climate conversation. So I think that was kind of the first really important realization that like all of all of the responses to the climate and to other problems are kind of heavily ideological shaped, right? And like, if you have a situation like every other climate, which is kind of dominated by one kind of ideology, this will kind of shape the shape the results. So so I think that was kind of one, I think another one a bit later, when I was studying in the in the United States, this was like 2012, 2011, 2012. This was the time where essentially in the US kind of the big push, the big push under Obama to kind of push for climate policy. Waxman Markey was the name. So that kind of a cap and trade bill in the United States kind of had just failed, right? And this was like a once in a generation moment with regards to climate policy in the US, right? So like the Democrats had like won the presidency had like a huge majority in the House and the Senate as well, right? So like, was kind of a situation of reckoning, like, what are we going to do now? Because like, even even under such favorable conditions that we kind of can expect every like 15 or 20 years, like, we're not able to pass climate policy in the US. So I think in that time, kind of discovered kind of I think what I would describe is kind of like the innovation hawk argument in climate, right? So like people that are like very heavily focused on innovation, which I think at that time was kind of not that big a part of the of the climate coalitions. I think that's kind of another thing that changed around that time. And I don't think I go all the way but it's kind of interesting. So because in a way, what they did or what they were emphasizing kind of became a big part of climate policy that later passed. So like that has just passed with President Biden is kind of essentially putting this lots of those ideas into practice. But so that's another one. And then I think another kind of big one, of course, for me growing up as a German environmentalist, I was heavily anti nuclear. And being in the US also is the first time kind of exposed to pro nuclear environmentalists. And for a time was kind of lukewarm about nuclear and at some point kind of realized, okay, even though it's very uncomfortable in the German context, because otherwise reasonable people become like very unreasonable and very emotionally aggressive, like, when you're talking about nuclear and when they became pro nuclear, but that was kind of an important shift of mind as well. I think those are kind of three. And then two more recent ones, I would say, 2015, essentially a success of the Paris Agreement. So up until 2015, I think international climate policy by and large had always failed. And this was kind of like, the expectations were very low. And then the fact that the Paris Agreement kind of succeeded, even though it's kind of a non binding agreement, but it can has completely changed the conversations that we're having in different countries. So it kind of serves as this kind of North Star that kind of lots of national conversations that kind of focused on. So I think that's kind of was another surprise. In what sense did the Paris Agreement succeed? What would have been the results of it? I mean, the Paris Agreement has succeeded. I mean, not only the Paris Agreement, but like around that time. So like that was in late 2015, and then like 2016, 2017, the nature of the climate conversation has completely changed, right? Like around that time in Western countries anyway, in the sense that like before it was kind of a relatively niche issue, and it kind of became like a broad societal consensus that like meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement matters. I mean, it's maybe not political consensus across the political aisle in all countries, but at least kind of for the left, the central left kind of in all countries. So I think that kind of really changed and kind of the idea of net zero and that climate was kind of a top issue. Yeah, so I think that's kind of I think what the Paris Agreement achieved, right? And like, this is kind of very significant, like compare it, right? It's like it's a non-binding treaty, ultimately. So there is a version, I think you could have had a cynical take on this agreement kind of before, like it's not and I certainly had this to a degree, like it's not going to do much because it's like a non binding, very weak agreement on some level, that's true. So that's not what it's doing, what it's doing, it's kind of like transforming, conforming the conversation. And you mentioned a last thing that you changed your mind on? I think a last thing that I would mention is kind of that. I think that's kind of maybe like 2020 or so. Essentially, that the situation around climate has improved very, very significantly, which is kind of funny to say this, because I think most people have the have the opposite perception. But like, in general, that like so like in 2015, 2016, people were saying things like, there's a 5% probability of some of more of six degrees, or more warming. And I think right now, if you would make this forecast, the forecast right now would be something like maybe like half a percent that we get to six degrees at all, and not more than six degrees, like an order of magnitude change. And so essentially, that the forecast before we're probably with pessimistic, but also that the situation kind of has has changed very significantly, mostly through the success of renewables, the success of kind of electric cars that essentially the the very high risk climate futures are essentially almost ruled out at this point. And that's a very significant change. I'm wondering, when you're working with climate change, this is such a complex issue. It's it's a it involves a lot of disciplines, not just climate science itself, but economics and law and the physics and engineering and all of these disciplines, how do you form an all things considered view of the situation in light of all of these disciplines? I mean, you can't go get a PhD in all of them, I'm guessing. And so how do you yeah, how do you how do you approach this? I mean, in theory, you could but by the time you have those PhDs, the problem was solved. Yeah, so I think the answer here, I mean, has to be to kind of, essentially, you're always in the state of like kind of being a reviewer and kind of like a reviewer of different pieces of evidence. So that's like one piece of the answer. Another piece of the answer is kind of obviously, you do this on a team, right? So like, essentially, right now, in my team, well, like we have a specialist kind of for the technical economics, we have a specialist for Carmlock and emerging economies, we have a specialist for philanthropy and have other philanthropists behave. So that's kind of another piece of the answer. But to, I think to answer it more substantively, I think there's kind of like, three kinds of expertise that are like most significant, when it comes to the question of like, that I'm trying to answer, which is like, what should we be doing philanthropically, right? So which is kind of like only one way to answer the question of there, I think it's kind of like one is kind of really the social science question of like political visibility, like, which kind of like carbon taxes, can we get where which kind of policies can we achieve in a given country? So that's kind of like, what does the option space actually look like? So that's kind of, I think, one key expertise. The other one is kind of like, what do different policies or different kind of things in the world, what do they achieve, right? So like, that's, I guess, policy analysis on econometrics and stuff like that. And then there's kind of because climate change is really a decadal challenge and the global challenge and like, it's also a challenge of like, global technological transformation. So then there's kind of this question of like, what do changes and countries kind of what are the long term consequences of that and kind of changing the technology stack, if you will, globally, so it's a techno economic question. And I think those three expertise was I kind of the most, most relevant ones, from a, from a solution oriented perspective. And then of course, if you're a philanthropist like myself, then also like, what are other philanthropists doing, right? Because like, doing the best thing on the margin is almost always about kind of finding blind spots and filling the blind spots. Okay, so let's get to this broad overview that I would like of climate change on the broadest possible scale. What is it that's driving climate change? Is it mostly emissions? And if so, where are these emissions coming from? So it's like mostly mostly emissions, right? And so like all of the mean all of climate change is about emissions. And so if you kind of I mean, there's sort of different ways to slice it by I guess, let's first kind of slice it by sector. So if you kind of look at it by sector, then there's like 75% of emissions are related to kind of energy and energy here like one very important thing about climate electricity is only a small part of energy electricity is about a third of energy. So like when I say 75%, that's not only electricity, right? That's also kind of transport fuels that's heating fuels and that's also stuff like industrial heat. Essentially, the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy. So that's about 75% of emissions. Then there's about 5% of emissions that's kind of emissions from industrial processes. So stuff like producing cement or chemicals where you kind of have emissions that are not related to fossil fuels that are called process emissions, right? And it doesn't mean that industry is only 5%. This is about the kind of the non energy share of industry. So that together gets you to like about 80%. And then there's about 15 or like 18%. That's kind of related to agricultural emissions, broadly. And then the last 5% or so is kind of a combination of on the one hand, stuff like deforestation, and then the other hand, stuff like waste. So yeah, I think 80% of the challenge is kind of energy energy industry. There's two important qualifications to this. This is kind of where the emissions are coming from right now, right? And like, that doesn't mean that this is exactly proportional to what the solution looks like. So like, it can definitely be the case of kind of land use change and kind of like restoring wilderness, etc. It's like a bigger part of the of the solution pipes. I think that's kind of one qualification. And another qualification is that these percentages are kind of heavily dependent on what warming metrics you use. So the numbers that I cited right now are kind of for what's called global warming potential 100. So like, if we're kind of assuming over the course of 100 years, if you kind of take a shorter view, if you would say something like global warming potential for the next 20 years, then something like agriculture would have like a larger share because methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas in the short term has kind of a relatively larger share in agriculture than in other sectors. So that's another important qualification here. Yeah. And in global terms, our emissions still increasing? Yes. And how long do we expect them to increase? Well, I mean, people have been talking about the end to emission increase for a long time. And then there's always something, something else coming up. So I think we will probably see the end to increasing emissions this decade. So I mean, it's mostly dependent on what China and India are doing at this point. And they're both kind of, yeah, have to go to kind of peak their emissions rather soon. So it could happen, could happen this decade. Yeah, you mentioned China and India, we should talk about geographically where emissions are coming from, where, where have they come from in the past and where are they likely to come from in the future? Well, so I think in the past, right, if you kind of take the long view, then, and that's like, most of the emissions are certainly like have been caused by, by Western countries, I think that's, that's kind of clear. And like, we do have being in Western countries, like a large historical responsibility. But if we kind of look at the situation right now, like the US right now, something like 15% of emissions, the EU is something around like 10%. And like Asia is kind of something like close to two thirds of emissions and then kind of the rest. And if we kind of think this picture going forward, right, so like the share of the EU and the share of the US is going to kind of further decrease, I mean, probably to something like for the US to something like 5% for like the EU, maybe something like 3%. And then, yeah, China is going to be something like 25% I think over over the course of the century, then other other emerging Asia kind of India and then Southeast Asia. And then kind of at some point later in the century, Africa, hopefully will, hopefully will grow strongly and like, I mean, yeah, let's hope it's going to be low carbon. But like, I guess there's kind of this kind of also part of the long game. So like the emissions are very clearly the focus of emissions is very much changing, right? That's kind of what I sometimes call like the central conundrum of climate policy, which is like the people that are responsible for a lot of the historical emissions kind of have very little direct leverage and kind of how the problem is going to become because kind of essentially, in the EU, like there's not a lot of emissions you can reduce like I mean, anymore, right? Like I mean, already kind of reaching the goal of getting to carbon neutrality by 2050 is like very ambitious. But at that point, like there's there's no leverage left. Because you project that EU is only going to be 3% of emissions. And so reducing emissions by 3% would be great, but it's not going to tackle the problem in a big way. Essentially, most of the leverage that the EU has on emissions does not come from the own territorial emissions, right? So if we kind of look at the most significant things that EU countries have done, it's like things like Denmark making wind energy cheap, Germany kind of making solar cheap. These these kind of things have like done way way more to like transform the energy future than like emission changes within Europe. European countries have subsidized technologies that can then be exported to other countries where they can decrease emissions much more than they could in those European countries themselves. From what you're saying that the biggest problem or the biggest driver of emissions is energy production. I wonder if that category is too broad. I mean, a lot of things must must be covered by energy production. Is it? What what does that category cover? Yeah, so like I think, yeah, I mean, it covers kind of electricity, it covers heating, it covers transport, and it also covers, I mean, that's also heating, but it's kind of very different than what we mean when we say heating like stuff like industrial heat, right, which like steel and stuff like that. And like on some level, it's kind of true broader term. I still find it useful to think about as kind of one piece, because especially if we're thinking about the kind of the solution trajectory, right? So like, what like, I guess the master plan plan and so far as there is a master plan to kind of solve climate, right? As essentially electrify everything or like mean electrify all energy consumption, right? So that sounds like, historically, those sectors have been very different, but like, or kind of also very different in terms of the fuels, but like, you want to get in a situation where like, the central problem is one of kind of on the one hand getting electricity or energy production kind of low or zero carbon. And on the other hand, kind of either directly right with electric cars or indirectly through stuff like hydrogen, electrifying kind of a lot of other stuff. So in that sense, it's a cross simplification to speak of like energy as one sector, but it's also, I think, if we're kind of at the broad level, it's a useful one in terms of, yeah, in terms of the solution landscape. Yeah, so so the categories is kind of unified by the same solution, the same solution would solve all of the the the things that belong to that category. So electrification would be a solution for many of the things that belong to that category. Or is that too strong? I mean, it's just a little bit too strong. But I think it's kind of right in the, yeah, basically right, I would say, right. So, so how far electrification goes kind of depends on like, like things are differentially easy to electrify. So like, things that are hard to electrify stuff that kind of requires, I mean, either a long duration of storage or like lots of kind of concentrated energy, or so like stuff like heavy duty transport, right, like electrifying trucks is much harder than electrifying passenger cars. And like, like refining large or like decarbonizing large ships, it's kind of much harder and airplanes much harder than cars. So, and for some of those, you might either use kind of indirect electrification, right? So kind of like hydrogen or like using power to create hydrogen. But it might also go another way, you can also kind of create hydrogen kind of with natural gas and carbon capture and storage. Yeah, so that's kind of where there is more, more nuance there, where we can kind of dive deeper. Why is it more difficult to electrify an airplane than a car? Is it is it because the airplane will have will have a need for higher peak energy output or something like that? Well, it's essentially, I mean, batteries are very heavy. And so like an airplane becomes much more efficient, because once you burn the fuel, it's kind of not, it has no weight anymore. And it's also so like that's kind of one part. And like the other part is kind of like energy, energy density, right? So like, in principle, like flying and air, like flying kind of requires a lot of, like, it's kind of much harder than kind of moving moving a car around. And so you kind of need, need higher energy density. Okay, so what I want to do is to walk through all of the potential technological options we have. Start with that. I'm going to start with talking about oil and coal, which is kind of a funny place to start maybe, because in some sense, oil and coal is is the whole reason for the problem. But I think it's interesting to discuss oil and coal just because if we know something about why they are hard to replace, we might know something about how to how to best go about the climate change problem. So yeah, I've written down that that oil and coal is cheap, and it works in existing systems. Do you see other advantages beyond those I just mentioned? Yeah, I think those are kind of the the two really big ones, right? And like work in existing systems, I think another way to put this is like, we've essentially built an entire world economy around them. So they fit with existing systems, because we built an entire economy around them and not only in the economy, right? Like the United States is kind of having aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, because kind of protecting oil reserves is kind of part of the, well, it's like part of the overall kind of strategy, right? So it's like, yeah, essentially, we've been spending more than a century optimizing our energy and world economy for relying on oil, alcohol, natural gas, I think another kind of advantage that they do have, I mean, at least if we compare them to renewables, to most renewables is that they do have higher energy densities. So yeah, and then of course, I mean, in the case of oil, right, like oil is easy to transport, coal is also relatively easy to transport with gas, it's a bit harder. Yeah, so I think this is kind of like broadly speaking, that's that seems like the right characterization. And of course, the enormous disadvantage here is that there's very high emissions associated with oil and coal. And I think additionally, there are, there are quite large problems with air pollution, which provides us with an additional reason to replace oil and coal, maybe you could talk about air pollution from from oil and coal. How big of a problem is that? So air pollution at large kills about 7 million people every year. So it's like one of the leading causes of death. And not all of that is related to fossil fuels, right? So like, we also have the situation that some of that is actually related to renewables, like to, especially in Africa, people burning wood for heating at home and for cooking. So that that's actually a situation where like using a fossil fuel, in this case, natural gas would actually be much better because it would. But essentially, so, in particular, coal and oil, kind of, yeah, yeah, kill kill a lot of people. So gas is a lot cleaner. So gas is about 15 times cleaner than coal in terms of air pollution. But it's a very significant cause of death. And I think it's also really underappreciated. So like, people usually talk about air pollution is kind of like a co benefit of climate change. Unlike climate change has to get really bad to kill like 5 million people every year. Like, right? So like, it's kind of quite possible that resolving climate change and like the most significant effect of that is kind of a reduction in kind of air pollution casualties, right? Obviously, like this is not the highest risk case, right? Like there are cases with there's no case with air pollution, like killing 100 million people, right? And there's kind of cases, there's a risk cases around climate that kind of motivate caring about climate that are more extreme than killing 5 million people. But like, we would yeah, it's just just I guess it's not it's not a co benefit. It's kind of a problem on a similar order of magnitude. Yeah, makes sense. Air pollution is a huge deal. Why is it that oil and gas is hard to replace? And here we might talk about a carbon lock in also, which is a term that that's used. The primary reason that if like energy transitions are, well, energy transitions are hard for a couple of reasons, right? But like, okay, let's let's kind of start with that with a lock in reason to begin with. A lot of the assets, right, like pipelines, or coal power plants, or highways, etc. Right? Like those are very long lived assets, right? They have natural lifetimes that are like 40 or 60 years. They're capital intensive assets. So like, even if like, you're kind of in a situation where like every new build is kind of the low carbon alternative, it will take you like 40 years to kind of turn around like an entire system, right? And that's kind of an optimistic case. So like, it's like, there's a lot of kind of lock in and then there's so like, this is kind of at the pure kind of technical or infrastructural level, right? And then you also have stuff like, like pipelines and infrastructure, which are, which are even, even longer, longer lived than single assets. And then of course, you have like a huge kind of political economy, like political special interest kind of groups and kind of the entire kind of fate of countries essentially build around that, right? I guess like when people say like, Putin used to behave like the CEO of like a gas company, right? Like, I mean, kind of changed a little bit the way he's behaving. But like, right, like, it's kind of like, like their entire countries or entire kind of regions of the world that are like heavily dependent on the fossil fuel economy. So I think that's kind of another really big reason. And another reason of like, obviously, is also like energy transitions in general move towards denser forms of energy, right? So like what we're trying to do right now, where we're essentially saying, okay, we want to move from a fossil fuel dominated energy economy to one that's kind of dominated by renewables, kind of not a natural direction for an energy transition to go. So like the more natural direction of energy transitions thus far has been like from less energy dense fuels of like from biomass to fossil fuels, right? And like, going from fossil fuels to mostly mostly renewable powered systems, actually, it's not a natural move of the energy system, probably wouldn't happen. Like there are many other situations where it kind of wouldn't happen. Yeah, maybe here is a natural point to talk about energy density. Why is energy density important? So energy density, right? So like, essentially how much land or how many resources do you need to kind of produce a given amount of energy? So the reason that's important, I think, is kind of like, two fold mean from an environmental perspective, energy density is essentially a proxy for like, how much impact we have on the environment, right? So if you're using less land, using less materials, then you're kind of like principle, like lower energy density means like lower environmental impact. So that's kind of one, one part of it. The other part, which is more about like what's useful for for human civilization, right? So like having denser forms of energy, like if you're talking about electricity, it means like you need less transmission, for example, right? So like that's kind of another use. And you're also kind of, if you want to power, like an industrial center or like an urbanizing society, like having lots of energy, and having relatively dense forms of energy is useful. One shouldn't overdo this, right? It's like, I'm not saying like, on the limit, kind of, we would have like one big fusion plant and we all kind of just get from. So that's clearly not the case. I think we've seen this with nuclear fission that like, having very large kind of energy sources also as a downside, because demand isn't always there. So like, not take it to the extreme limit, but like, kind of, on some level, like energy density and principle is kind of useful, a useful metric. But when you when you talk about energy density, it's you're talking about also the resources necessary to produce that energy, not only the energy density, say, for example, of a 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter cube of coal or oil or fuel for for a nuclear reactor, it's a broader term than that. That's energy density, where we have historically been moving towards forms of energy that are that are more dense. And now we're trying to move towards forms of energy that are that are less dense. I think before we get to renewables, we should we should talk about natural gas that you mentioned a couple of times. And what are the advantages here and disadvantages? I'm guessing it's it's better than oil and coal. Just to add on the energy density, like because we've talked about why it's important, but we didn't talk about what does it actually look like. So like, if you're kind of if you look at the metric site, nuclear nuclear power would be something like seven terawatt hours per square kilometers, natural gas, which we're going to talk about next, it's like about half that. And like solar is kind of about 100 or so, roughly, what nuclear is right. So that's kind of why it matters. Like the differences are quite stark, both from from renewables to fossil fuels and from fossil fuels to nuclear, like natural gas, if we talk about natural gas. So I mean, it's about half as polluting as coal, in terms of CO2. And it's much, much less polluting about 15 times less polluting when we talk about air pollution. And essentially, if we look at the decarbonization successes of the last 20 years, like many of them have been coal to gas transitions. So like, essentially, the fact that the US was kind of able to reduce emissions, even though until like 2021 didn't really have much in terms of climate policies, like, mostly the story of the fracking revolution in the United States, and kind of the replacement of coal by natural gas, a little bit similar in the UK, in the UK, there's kind of natural gas is also like more of a renewable expansion. And that's so like, that's kind of another select that's kind of this has been a big story. It's like an easy win, right? It's not a transformational win because you don't get to zero emissions. But it's kind of the easy win. So if you're imposing moderate carbon price, in a place with a lot of coal, that will usually mean you're gonna substitute it with natural gas. In which cases does it make sense to switch to natural gas? I mean, that's kind of like, right, that that's kind of I think something where the climate community has like two different perspectives, right? I think there are people that are more incrementalists that would say like, yeah, it's good if you're switching from coal to natural gas. There's also people that would say, okay, if you're switching from coal to natural gas, you're locking in another fossil fuel source, right? And it's kind of like better to maybe have coal run a bit longer and then fully replace it with a zero carbon source. I think that's kind of the debate. And I think different people have like different opinions. And I think also the right answer might be different in different places. The best case scenario would be one for like, natural gas replaced with coal. And then natural gas is kind of replaced with natural gas and gas and carbon capture. So where you're kind of capping the emissions or where you're using kind of part of the natural gas infrastructure with like zero carbon fuels, right? So like with natural gas kind of that's produced for electrolysis and kind of like additional like adding CO2 there or yeah, so it's a synthetic natural gas, essentially. So that last point, is there a way to produce that natural gas that's more environmentally friendly? So I mean, natural gas is CH4. So in principle, you can, you can get it from H2 like from hydrogen, like which you can generate in a low carbon way. And if you would kind of then take CO2 out of the air, so you can essentially produce like carbon neutral, natural gas, right? Like this. Yeah, or you could use hydrogen. Yeah. So essentially, there's ideas of about using some of the kind of natural gas infrastructure for like zero carbon gases. And that's I think something like one way where carbon lock in can be made a little bit less severe, right? Where you're like locking in like a gas infrastructure, for example, but that gas could at some point be carbon neutral. Yeah, if we build a new natural gas plant now, how much carbon are we locking in? For how many years would this natural gas plant have to run in order to be profitable or to make sense to build? If you're building new natural gas plants right now, I think they expect like most like if you're in a Western country, I don't think the investor would have the expectation that they're going to run this for 40 years, because like running this for 40 years would mean they're not 2023. So like 13 years after kind of most Western countries have committed to like reaching net zero. That being sad, right? Like even countries like Germany, that are kind of priding themselves to be climate leaders are building new natural gas capacity right now in an energy crisis situation, right? So we're essentially, I guess the way this becomes profitable is because we really do value energy security. So like, as countries, we're willing to kind of finance things that don't make sense in a long run perspective, if you will. Maybe we could say a bit more about energy density and why it's important. Is it important because some forms of energy take up too much space and then crowd out other other things we would like to do with that space like having natural habitats or yet using the land for agriculture or what's the problem with energy sources with low energy density? So like crowding out of like other land uses is definitely a factor, right? So especially for biofuels, I think it's a factor with like biofuels take up a lot of land and like kind of agricultural land that that can compete with like food security concerns. Yes, I think that is kind of one concern. So like land use, right? So like if I looked at a paper where essentially that's kind of modeling a transition towards a lower carbon future and what they're essentially like, and like a renewable heavy future, what they're essentially modeling is like, okay, by 2050, there is some six fold increase in the land required required for energy production compared to today. And like to be fair, like it's not that it's six times less efficient, because also like electricity production is like assumed to triple over the time frame rate. So that's kind of a halving of like efficiency in terms of like energy density, that's like a still a significant change. I think to me, the more the more fundamental challenge is really one of like, if you're having lots of decentralized energy sources, like kind of the requirements in terms of transmission and like infrastructure, build out are kind of like much, much larger, right? So essentially, when we're saying it is cheap, and it is easy to build renewables, we're talking about is kind of on the plant level where this is true. But when we're talking about the energy system level and say like we want to build an energy system that is primarily based on low energy density sources, like I'm not saying this cannot work, but like this is like a risky proposition, mostly for the for transmission and storage requirements that are kind of related to low energy density and intermittency. Okay, so that's oil, coal and natural gas. What about if we if we get into the renewables, so solar and wind? What are some advantages of solar and wind? At this point, solar and wind are pretty cheap. So at this point, I think in many, in many places in the world will be the case that like adding solar capacity to the grid is like one of the cheapest things you can do. It's very important to realize that like this is not a fact of like nature or like technology itself, that's a result of like very conscious social choices, right? I mean, it's essentially countries like Germany and jurisdictions like California, and then later kind of China, essentially saying, okay, we really want to have cheap renewables, and we're really like heavily investing that. So in that sense, kind of the fact that we have cheap renewables right now is much more a function of their popularity with constituencies than it is kind of like the principle underlying technology, right? So like, if like nuclear would be as popular as like renewables are, we probably also could have like cheap nuclear now, this is kind of what I'm saying, or a geothermal for that matter. So I think that's kind of an important aspect here. So yeah, there can be quite cheap. And also there are use cases where decentralized and kind of smaller production is kind of good, right? So I mean, you can kind of use deploy them where they are needed, right? Like if you're, if you're a small town, you're not going to build your own kind of big power plant, but you can build your, but your solar's on the rooftop, etc. So I think that's kind of the main advantage obviously produces no carbon, no air pollution. Yeah, and can be can be built quickly. Yeah, so you mentioned that that solar and wind have gotten cheaper because of basically policies by European countries and by California and so on. When when solar has reached the price point that it has that it that it's at now, does it require kind of continual subsidies to stay at that price point? Or have we developed solar to a point now that it's price competitive, even on an open market, let's say. So in energy, you generally don't have open markets. I think that's an important thing to realize. So solar is competitive in many cases, right? But like, it's not like with oil, we're like, you have a global price of oil, right? It's like, essentially, for solar, like how costs affect on the solar, compared to alternatives depends on like, how good is the solar resource? Depends also on like, how much solar is already on the grid? Because like, you can be in a situation where like installing the additional solar capacity is very cheap, but it's not going to produce a lot of additional value because essentially, like the sun is shining at the time where you're already at 100% solar, then like, it's easy to add an additional solar power plant, that's kind of it doesn't add a lot. Unless you kind of have cheap storage or cheap transmission, super cheap, sorry, super cheap transmission. So that's what's called value deflation. So it's not really like, it doesn't really make sense to think about it as like, one price point that that is being, being undercut, right? So like, we're in a situation where there are places in the world where like, adding solar kind of happens without subsidies, and it's kind of like, essentially, the natural result of like market forces or like mediated market forces. And we have also places with quite a very high renewable penetration, right, places like California, or Germany, where like, places that made renewables so cheap, but that are now kind of struggling to add a lot more because stuff like system integration, or like the value of an additional plant is kind of, is kind of low. How much of our energy production could be replaced by wind and solar alone? The problem with wind and solar, or one problem is that it's intermittent. So it requires the sun to shine or the wind to blow, unless you have a really good storage technology, basically, batteries. But how much of our energy production do you think we could replace by by solar and wind? You don't only need batteries, right? So like, essentially, you need to solve, I think, three or four problems. So like, one is kind of short term storage. For this, you can use batteries. And right, that's kind of like, okay, you can run your washing machine during the night, that that's kind of the use case. Then you kind of need to solve in most places in the world, you need to solve seasonal storage, right, so that there's kind of like parts of the year where like, there's much less solar available. Like, that's like a much, much harder challenge. And I think that's kind of underappreciated, because people talk about storage, they think about batteries, and they think the problem was solved. And like, kind of essentially, being able to have enough energy to like half a month, or like more kind of work of like energy reserve requires a very different solution. It's not probably not going to happen with batteries, that's kind of for something like, right, what I've talked about before, like, power to x, like producing hydrogen or kind of other forms of like, low carbon energy, like gases or like liquid to store energy. So like, that's kind of what you will need there. And then there's kind of the problem of transmission. And then there's a problem around essentially, do we have enough land in the jurisdictions? I think the last one will not be the decisive constraint, I think that that will will probably work. But essentially, there's like, three, three challenges, like storage in the short term, seasonal storage, transmission, I can't imagine the world, right, if when I think about the future, I always try to think of a distribution. And like, there's like part of that distribution where like, okay, wind and solar are kind of really like 80 or 90% of the energy supply. And essentially, seasonal storage has been solved, transmission has been solved, and it's kind of that that's a large part of the solution. Those are not the futures I'm particularly worried about. Because I mean, those are really very best case futures, it's like an AI safety of like AGI is inherently safe, that's kind of the future. And then there are kind of the futures where like, something has gone wrong, right? And like, that's kind of like an hour climate response and like a natural thing or things like one of the most likely failure modes right now that we can like, if we kind of if we're kind of waking up in 2040, and like, we're on a trajectory to like, more than three degrees, it's very likely that kind of, we've been overbeating on intermittent renewables, that essentially, that it is much harder, even though it's easy to get to like 20, 30% in electricity, like getting to like 100% in energy right again, like, and then like, growing demand, like something like 10x compared now that this is kind of really hard. So this is an area where there's very significant uncertainty, I would say we're kind of, yeah, on the top, you can kind of do almost get almost 100%, but also where it's kind of quite imaginable that you don't get over, over 50% of energy, which will still be like a huge, huge role, right? I mean, right now, it's kind of something like three to 4% of like energy. You mentioned the seasonal storage, what are the most promising approaches there? This is something where it's not primarily about batteries, right? So it's primarily about kind of using more energy dense form. So like, for example, using using kind of excess capacity, excess power capacity, to produce carbon neutral hydrogen and to store this as hydrogen or to kind of store this like synthetic natural gas. This to me seems right now, the most plausible trajectory. I mean, there's also kind of like, there's, there's lots of different technologies that are being tried out. Okay, so that's, that's solar and wind, which could turn out very, very well. But where there are challenges to be solved before they can be implemented and can constitute a large percentage of our energy production. That sounds too pessimistic. It's more like, solar and wind will definitely play a much larger role than they're playing now. The question is, will they take us to 100% but like, yeah, that's a different, yeah, it's a different framing, right? So like, yeah, the short term story is definitely about the expansion of, of mature renewables. We should say something about the, to my eyes, insane decrease in the price of solar, or at least it looks like a very, very steep decrease when I look at these graphs. Yeah, can you say something about how much cheaper solar is now compared to 20 years ago? Well, it's essentially at like less than 10% of where it was 20 years ago, right? So like, that's, that isn't an insane decrease. So I like, I remember when I was kind of entering the climate conversation, and people were talking about renewables, they were always talking about solar wind, geothermal, hydro, bio, at some point, people only started talking about solar and wind, right? Because essentially, those technologies could like radically cheaper, in particular, solar wind also, but a bit less so. Yeah, so that's a very, very steep decline, right, which has been achieved. There's a great book about this how solar got cheap by Gregory Named, but essentially, it's kind of primarily a result kind of very aggressive policy. I mean, it kind of goes back to the 1970s and like, the first oil crises from like Jimmy Carter, but then kind of got really picked up in the early 2000s, right, of like Germany, kind of really strongly supporting it, also like not only Germany, also like California, etc. And then like, at some point, China essentially massively investing in production capacity. So yeah, and that's kind of a big part of the story as well. It's not a story of fundamental technological innovation. It's really more of a brute force approach to making things cheap. What about Hydro? Could Hydro ever constitute a large percent of our energy production? So Hydro could, I think, I mean, it's like, it's already, I think it's still, if I'm not mistaken, it's still like the largest renewable energy resource, right? It's kind of, it's not really talked about because it's kind of like, static, it's not like the, it's not sexy, it's not where the action is. But like, it's a very significant part. I think like with Hydro, like large Hydro has like large kind of environmental downsides. And I think another kind of constrained, like, so that's a couple of other constraints. And one is like geopolitical. If you're kind of talking about them, hydropower is often like a very kind of contentious issue if you're thinking about denial or other other areas. So like, that's another big problem. And it's also like very long term infrastructure. So I think like, Hydro, I think, like from a technical perspective, like Hydro could play a larger role, but it's kind of, I don't think there are many people that are kind of betting on like an abundant future with lots of Hydro. Or at least I haven't come across them. I think I know exactly like one charity that's working on hydropower. That's mostly on making less clear paths. And the answer, they're kind of trying mostly to use hydropower, making existing hydropower or existing dams more efficient, like essentially using them more to produce electricity. Do we even have enough large rivers to, to generate enough electricity by Hydro? That's a good question. But I actually don't know the answer because it's kind of so far out of the overturned window. One other thing I want to say on Hydros that essentially Hydro is affected by climate change as well, right? So like, essentially that Hydro is becoming a less reliable energy resource, essentially, as kind of climate patterns, precipitation patterns become harder to predict and more extreme. So I think it's kind of another reason why it's not like, it's not a major bet that anyone I think is kind of really making at this point. Okay, let's move on to nuclear energy. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages there? Hey, like the biggest advantage is like related to energy density, right? I mean, it sounds like ironic and very counterintuitive to say this, but like from an environmental perspective, like nuclear is kind of the cleanest, cleanest form of energy production. Because it's like of those that we have right now, because it's so, so energy dense, it doesn't need a lot of materials, it doesn't need a lot of land. Yeah, so I think that's kind of the clear advantage produces zero carbon disadvantages, I think are are well known in the case of nuclear. So accident risk, nuclear waste. Yeah, and also I guess some dual use concerns around like nuclear weapons. Yes, I think those are kind of the disadvantages and also right now, but that's not a fundamental feature of technology. That's kind of something of, I guess it's a result of social choice. Right now, it's very expensive and slow to build. Yeah, that was actually my my next question would be, when I look at some new nuclear power plant, it has often taken a decade or more to build. And it's gone over budget. So so why is it so? Why does it take so long? And why does it cost so much to build nuclear power plants? Like I think right now, I mean, we were able to build nuclear power plants in France and something like four years, right? And right now, we're not able to do this in the West right now, it would probably more take something like 20 years. But so there's a lot of variance here that is like, it's not like related to the features of the technology or like our fundamental technological ability, right? There's like a 5x kind of difference that's kind of related to regulation, economy, societal commitment, etc. Right? That's kind of where where the explanation ultimately has to be. So I think there's kind of lots of different reasons. I mean, one, like, I guess, one most general one, which is not nuclear specific is like in general, in the West, we're not able to build things, right? It's not only that we're not able to build nuclear plants, we're also not in Berlin, we're not even able to build airports. So, so I think that's kind of like the general class of like, there's lots of general stuff around like regulation and kind of interest groups. But then there's also like nuclear specific stuff, right? And I think it's essentially, I think the most significant part is that essentially the supply chain for for building nuclear in the West has essentially fallen fallen apart, right? So like, we're building things kind of in the first of a kind style, or kind of not first of a kind, but like first in a decade or first in a decade more, which is not the way to build like anything kind of at scale anything efficiently. That's not how France kind of built the nuclear fleet, right? So like, the most successful example of building out nuclear quickly is like France from the like late 70s to like late 80s. So that's, I think, most of the explanation. What did France do right? I mean, France was in a situation of emergency. So like the 1970s at the time of like the big oil price shocks and like France is a country without significant domestic energy supply. So they were extremely exposed to the oil price shocks. And at the same time, they were already in nuclear power, right? Like they kind of have like nuclear expertise, very centralized government. So yeah, they essentially decided, okay, we're gonna build nuclear as like a national project, and that kind of standardized it like one of like, both the same kind of reactor, both the workforce in a very centralized fashion, if you kind of compare this to the US, for example, where like utilities are kind of really spread out across the country, and like we're like, essentially, there's like not someone who's buying like 100 nuclear plants, right? There's kind of utilities that are buying like one reactor, or maybe two reactors and one plant or something like that, right? So like, the way that this happens was like fundamentally, fundamentally different. So these were very special circumstances. And like, just to be very clear, I'm not suggesting that those are transferable to today, right? Like it's not that the kind of shock or stress that France was under, it's not something we can replicate and say, oh, we're all we're all gonna build like to 80% nuclear in like 15 years, because of climate change, most countries are not able to do that. Like, technologically, they are, but like politically speaking, it doesn't seem feasible. Do you think we we need to develop new designs for nuclear reactors? Do we need to move to better designs? Do we need a molten salt reactors or something like this? Or are the reactor designs we have today enough? And this is, I think, an active debate in the like, in the nuclear community. And I think like, it kind of depends on how how do we define need in this context, right? So like, I think, from purely technical perspective, right, there's nothing wrong with existing nuclear power plants. So what's wrong is kind of like when the fact that we're not able to build them is kind of lack of societal commitment and like, lack of learning and stuff like that, right? So like, we can imagine a future where we built a lot of that. So the question is, can we actually get into that future? The most significant benefit of kind of advanced nuclear, like small, small modular reactors is essentially, it seems more plausible that this is kind of like, like, or there are countries where it seems more plausible that we're going to build lots of small modular reactors, because you can produce them and factories, you can essentially exploit the same learning curve dynamics that made renewables and electric cars and all other kind of technologies that we were able to make cheap cheap. So that's kind of another aspect. And it's also kind of playing much better with like renewable dominated grid. So it's kind of more flexible. And it's also like a smaller, smaller unit. So I think there, yeah, I think, I mean, we are like philanthropically speaking, we are we are betting on advanced nuclear or small modular reactors. But I wouldn't say it's necessarily related to like, technological problem with existing reactors is more like, yeah, the whole, yeah, yes, one of the themes here, it's not only about technology, it's about the whole like, societal kind of apparatus around the technology. And so the small modular reactors would be easier to innovate on because you would you would be able to develop one such reactor and deploy it and get feedback much, much more quickly than you can with a with a larger reactor, where it might take 15 years for it to to be built. And only then can you go back and think about what you could have done differently. Is it also a question of potentially you can you can mass produce these small modular reactors? What are the advantages here? So like it is the mass production, right, the mass production in a factory. So it's not only the 15 year thing, right, like under ideal circumstances, you could also build a large plant and something like four or six years, like you could also learn something from large plants, and you could build the same plant design over and over again. But it's much easier to learn. And like, obviously, it's like a controlled production environment, right? So like when kind of most of the reduction happens in a factory, I mean, obviously, some of the assembly has to happen on site, but like, that is where you can really kind of expect a high learning rates, right? So that's kind of, yeah, essentially, applying the same mechanism by which we make, make other kind of technologies cheap to the nuclear case. One last technology I want to run through is geothermal. This is something that's maybe like hydro, it's potentially a bit overlooked. But yeah, how promising do you think geothermal energy is? So I would say much more promising than hydro. But I think also, geopharmals definitely having a moment right now, and it's becoming radically less overlooked. There's traditional geothermal, which is kind of great, but it's very location specific, right? So you're low location dependent, you kind of do it, build it in lots of places, because you kind of need essentially not, yeah, you need kind of good conditions, you need like, yeah, close to volcano, etc. So like, essentially, you need to be closer to heat source near in the ground. And then there's kind of like different forms of like advanced geothermal. And that's a little bit like, there's like lots of different ones, it's like six or seven different ones. But I guess the one that we've been focusing on traditionally is what you would call ultra deep geothermal or like a super hot rock geothermal, where essentially, you're going so deep, that you can kind of make it much less location dependent, and also kind of get much, much warmer, what much hotter fuel, so you kind of get more, more energy density to get more favorable economics. And then that's kind of the idea of like, geothermal anywhere. So if you're kind of able to drill like, five kilometers or five down, yeah, that could be very promising. And that's kind of like, in general, this is not only true for super hot or ultra deep, but also kind of more generally for like innovations, you're formal. What this does, it's kind of leveraging the advances of the fracking of the Shea gas revolution, right? So like our ability to drill has been like, strongly increased through the through the fracking revolution and essentially applying this to to geothermal is kind of where a lot of the innovations coming from. And it's kind of very attractive, because once you make it work, right, you need to solve a couple of material science challenges here. But like, once those are solved, you have like a very mature labor force, and you kind of have like large economic interests, oil and gas, that will be quite interesting on that. So in that sense, it's kind of an innovation that is kind of locked in, if you will, right? So like, it's kind of not locked out, like Yeah, but if we're talking about drilling five kilometers down, this is not something you could do in in a person's backyard. So this is not as decentralized as for example, setting up solar panels on a on a roof in a residential neighborhood. No, it's solving the same problem that small modular reactors or like other kind of clean firm sources will solve, right? So it's not this is not about everyone having a super hot rock thing in their backyard. But this is about solving the hard part of electricity decarbonization, which is kind of clean firm resources, right? So like, not intermittent renewables, but something that can be dispatched and it can be used the entire time. I guess technically, this is not a renewable form of energy, but in a, in a kind of practical sense, it will take billions of years for the earth's heat to dissipate enough for this technology not not to work. So in practical terms, it's it's renewable. Yeah, in practical terms, I think the distinction renewable and not doesn't matter because I mean, renewables also require lots of non renewables, like resources to like, like, right, like in a way, so like the minerals that you need for like solar and wind and so like, so yeah, it's, it's not a, it's not a practical thing to worry about. But nor nor should you kind of worry about uranium running out or stuff like that. Okay, we've, we've done an overview of a lot of the technological options we have. If you were to to rank these technologies and think about, you know, a plan for how we might solve climate climate change using a combination of them. Where would you where do you see most promise in the short term and in the long term? I mean, in the short term, it's very clear that like intermittent renewables and natural gas will like do most of the like heavy lifting and decarbonization in the near future. So like, because they are quick to build and they're kind of quickly expanding right and like, okay, in some places also adding nuclear capacity, and also many other places like not prematurely shutting down nuclear capacity, right? So like, yeah, so those are I think kind of the short term and then hydropower, the short term options. And the medium runs something like, well, like advances in geothermal or advances in small modular reactors, right, could kind of address what right now is kind of a little bit of the Achilles heel of kind of electricity decarbonization, which is kind of clean for power, right? So like that's kind of why those are still important and like worth doing, even though like renewables right now are cheap, and there's kind of this like seduction of like only relying on existing technologies. But like, the reason to not do that is like the risk that we talked about before, but also kind of the energy system function of like clean firm, which right now is kind of not adequately solved. And when you say clean firm, what do you mean? Well, so clean, right, means like zero emissions and like zero air pollution and like otherwise clean. So like that includes nuclear that includes geothermal that includes fusion. If it were, if it were to happen. And firm here means that it's essentially it is not an intermittent resource, right? It's kind of not like solar and wind that is kind of so yeah, it can in principle be run 24 seven. And you will not use it for electricity 24 seven, but you might use it for for producing hydrogen at other times of the day. But like, yeah, essentially, that you're reducing what storage kind of needs to do, right? Like it's becomes a lot like building an energy system that has like clean firm resources in it, like it's a lot more realistic to get to like 100% kind of clean than if you're kind of entirely batting on intermittent resources. Yeah, so you think thinking across the different climate scenarios, it's a it will be smart strategy for us to also invest in some of these clean firm technologies and not just traditional renewables like wind and solar. Okay, yeah, so I think it's kind of worth distinguishing two separate strands of the argument here, even on kind of a normal kind of trajectory where renewables are very successful, like clean firm is kind of a useful compliment, right? And it makes the overall system more efficient, it kind of like reduces the like the necessity to like overbuild intermittent renewables reduces the necessity of storage, etc. Right. So like, the case for clean firms not entirely like hedging one, but then there's also kind of the hedging one, which is like, I think we talked about this before, right? Like, if we kind of wake up in 2040, and like, our situation looks much worse than we're thinking now, like, what has gone wrong? Well, one of the main things that could have gone wrong is that like expanding solar and wind was much hotter. And in that sense, investments in and clean firm are like a hedge against that. And there's a key fact of like climate that makes the hedging quality important. And that's essentially like the shape of climate damage. So that climate damage to kind of like, or our expectation of like how climate damage looks like is that it's kind of strongly nonlinear. So like, world with six degrees is like much worse than twice as bad than a world of three degrees and the world with three degrees much worse than twice as bad than 1.5 degrees. So it's kind of particularly important, right? I mean, you need to control for how likely those are. But like, it's like, even if you kind of control for how likely there are, it's kind of important to like, favor solutions that work in situations where a lot of damage is. So those are kind of right now, I would say those little worlds kind of more reflect 2.5 degrees like 2.5 to 3.5, like those are reasonably likely and reasonably more damaging than the worst cases that I kind of take a lot of the expected damage and the function. And under those, like if you're in those situations, right, you kind of, you know, something, probabilistically speaking, you know, you know, something that is likely to have happened in those worlds. Like one thing is likely to have happened is that renewables will have like, yeah, been more curtailed than we expect. Okay, and I think we'll discuss this more later, thinking about different climate scenarios and where we should spend our money in, to kind of cover all scenarios. But before we get there, I want to talk about some governmental options. What could governments do in order to help this situation? You mentioned before how European governments and California was able to subsidize renewables to such an extent that they are now quite cheap. In general, what's your sense of how well subsidies work? Would you recommend that governments try to pick out which which energy technologies they favor and then subsidize those? The broad answer to which Mrs. Canter relates to like, what is what, how good is the government at picking winners and like, how far should the government pick winners? I think like, the broad answer is here, like, the government was heavily involved in every kind of important technological success when it comes to energy and climate, and also like heavily involved in lots of different failures. So like on the success, right, we have like solar, we have electric cars, we have wind, we have nuclear, we have fracking. On the failure, we have stuff like cylindra, we have stuff like biofuels in the US, which are like subsidized because they're kind of big in Iowa and Iowa is important for presidential elections. Like, so like, you have like the good, the bad and the ugly kind of all all together, right? So like, that's important, right? It's like, it's not, there's essentially no example of like energy technology transformation that kind of where government has not played a huge role. So I think that that's something worth, like worth remembering kind of to start. And it's also there's no because there's no clear example where essentially technology has been an energy technology has been brought about primarily by market forces, right? So like, so like there's demonstration projects, those are often public or like at least publicly, partially publicly funded. Then there's kind of about this basic R&D where like government also plays a big role demonstration projects. And there's kind of like early procurement policies like across the entire chain of the environment of the innovation process government plays a huge role. And I think there isn't really an alternative to this or like we haven't really observed an alternative to this. So I think the view that I would kind of house like in general kind of government is much better than its reputation. Because like once electric cars get cheap, then we're all celebrating Elon Musk, but we're like forgetting the fact that like, there's like huge electric car subsidies that like may Tesla possible, right? Like, and I mean, there's a similar story, like not to pick on Elon Musk, right? There's a similar story for like most other kind of technological successes. At the end, there's kind of a private company that's kind of doing the last mile, that's getting a lot of the attention. But like before, or even at that last stage, there's huge, huge involvement by the government. So I think that's that's what I can say to, to start. So government will make mistakes. But I think the alternative is not to not let the government pick. Ideally, and I think that's what we're kind of seeing in the United States right now. You're essentially trying to support technology at the right, at the right level, right? So like, you shouldn't choose all technologies. And you should also like be humble in terms of like, you cannot pick all the winners. But right now, if you look at the the inflation reduction act, and the infrastructure bill selected to major pieces of kind of climate policy change in the United States are now, they're essentially like very broad, that's unlike lots of different technologies. And they're very kind of on the one hand, like then an infrastructure bill like R&D driven, in the case of the inflation reduction act more like subsidy and later stage technology driven, like, I guess they're a very strong form of government involvement. But in a way, they're taking a lot of winners, or like some of them will not be winners, right? So like, they're, they're kind of very, very broad on their, their approach to their credit. And do you think that's the right strategy to subsidize or to support from the government side across the right range of technologies and across different stages of technological development? So if we're saying that history is informative, then I think that's kind of what history teaches us about like innovation and energy. Yes. Are there any research and development into one of the the forms of energy technology we talked about that you think the government should spend more money on? Should the government be subsidizing at a later stage of development, some of these technologies? So like, I guess the contextualized the moment that we're in, right? So like we're in, well, mid 20 or mid to late 2023, and like, both in the United States, and to a lesser degree also in Europe, like we've seen like major climate policies over the last year, right? So like, like in the, in the United States was focused on that case, right? So like the inflation reduction act was passed, like essentially almost exactly a year ago, a year before the infrastructure was passed. Like both of those are kind of like, putting support for clean energy, essentially on a whole order of magnitude, kind of different levels. So we're now subsidizing or the inflation reduction act, we're going to subsidize renewable, like only renewables, clean energy, and other kind of clean technologies on the order of like, 300 billion, at least and could go, could go, could go higher than this. We are in a situation where like, money is not the primary constraint right now, for most kind of energy innovation, or it's kind of like, it's much more harder to make that case, right? Like, that doesn't mean we're in a situation where everything is kind of going great, right? It's more that kind of the challenges maybe more like stuff like permitting reform, or kind of making those demonstration projects happening, or like, in the case of nuclear reforming the nuclear regulatory commission. So it's not so much about money being the limiting constraint that and like, for the second part of the question, should they support at a later stage? Yes, absolutely. So I think the basic, the basic problem in the discourse, I think is that there's relatively broad support for like, basic research and development, right, like support for that is kind of very kind of mainstream, right, like lots of conservatives will kind of support investment and basic, basic R&D, because there's a very clear market failure there, it's very well recognized. So it's kind of very bipartisan, or at least there's kind of like a broad kind of set of people that will support that. But like the like the area where most failure happens kind of in the later stages is kind of like getting 100 million for a demonstration project. So that's something that historically in the United States, for example, has been hard to kind of get political buy-in to fund this work, right? Because it's also like, when you fail, you fail very recently, right? So like Mitt Romney in 2012, like started his campaign at the Solyndra plan, right? Like Solyndra being like kind of the example of the failure of kind of the clean energy investments of the Obama administration. So maybe, maybe explain what happened there. I'm not familiar with the, is it called Solyndra? Yeah, so like Solyndra was kind of like an advanced solar company that kind of was kind of heavily supported by the American Reinvestment Act, so kind of the small scale version of what Biden did now, like enlarge with inflation reduction act, kind of like so the recovery after honey, 18, the clean energy spending there. And Solyndra was kind of a very, very public failure of a company that was kind of heavily backed by the government. And yeah, essentially became the symbol of like, okay, the government is really bad at picking winners, right? And like, that kind of happened. At the same time as kind of the shale gas revolution was playing out, right? We're like, also the government had kind of played a big, big role in supporting that. So it's just like, we're very selective and like picking our examples. What do you think about carbon taxes? This is a solution to climate change that's often favored by economists, where you you simply price the negative externality of emissions, and then you let the market figure out how to implement the how to reduce emissions. Do you think carbon taxes could work? So and I guess I mentioned this in the beginning, but just just to recap. So before I joined founder slash, I spent five years working on carbon pricing emission trading system, carbon taxes. So I'm very familiar with those debates. I mean, I think they can work. But I think they will not play, like a major role in kind of the solution. And just like to give a couple of, couple of like arguments, why? So if you're like thinking again about kind of the example of like solar, and how solar got cheap. So the subsidies that kind of Germany was able to kind of that were politically feasible in the early 2000s in Germany. You could have achieved them with a carbon tax between like 700 to 900 something in that range, dollars per ton. That's an insanely high carbon tax. So like at that point, most of the world had no carbon taxes at all, right, like Germany had no carbon tax at all, like the only kind of countries having carbon taxes for like, Scandinavian countries. And like even then, like the highest carbon tax will be something like $50 a ton, right? So like, the really kind of transformative price signal that you need to like drive an immature technology, you will probably never get where the carbon tax that's politically feasible, right? Like you could not, it's not that you could have had the carbon tax at that level at that time. So I think that's kind of one reason, right? And now we're essentially like now we're essentially this situation where like solar were kind of the difference to the fossil fuel alternative was kind of zero in many cases, right? You wouldn't need a carbon tax. Essentially, to solve climate change, you need fundamental technological transformation. And for that, you need like very, very strong push and you cannot get this kind of push with a with a politically feasible price. So that's kind one constraint. And the other constraint is kind of the international situation. So if you were in a situation where you would have a global carbon tax, right, like maybe or a global kind of carbon price, maybe that would be enough to kind of induce some some innovation, etc. But like, you never, like, it's very far, very far from getting there. So I think right now we're in a situation where it's very clear that the most significant things that like individual countries can do, like in a situation where international coordination is relatively weak, are not about kind of introducing a carbon tax, like had Germany introduced the carbon tax in 2005, this would have or sorry, in 2005, we got the emission trading system. So let's say if we had like introduced like reasonably high carbon prices early in the 2000s, would have kind of accelerated like transition from like German coal to Russian gas, that would have been the main effect would not have had like transformative effects, globally speaking, right? So like, that's, I think, the really big constraint there. So essentially, yeah, carbon taxes might play a role. Once all technologies are reasonably close to competitiveness, and then kind of iron out a little bit on the on the margin. But I guess that that's kind of like not not the point where it really matters anymore. Yeah, and just just to check with you, what do you what do you think about planting trees? Is that with that work at all? Is that on the kind of what would that have a large enough effect to matter? You sometimes hear claims about the importance of the Amazon rainforest, for example, as a way of decreasing CO2 in the atmosphere, could the government initiate a large kind of projects of planting more forest for that work? So I mean, in principle, the easier thing had should always be avoiding deforestation, because planting trees to like to have a carbon effect, right, like it takes 20 years. It's not instantaneously useful. I mean, I guess, I guess to start with again, now we kind of need to refocus on, we're talking here on the margin. And when we talk about trees, everyone loves trees. Like the person I meet the most, like the superficial kind of climate person I meet the most, right? Like the first like, they want to like they want to plant trees, like that's the first thing that essentially everyone kind of coming into this conversation jumps to. Yeah, this is exactly why I brought it up, because I'm guessing that this proposal would be extremely popular with a kind of broad public and maybe that itself, even though planting trees may may not be the most effective thing. Just the fact that it's so popular might mean that it's it's easier to implement. And that could be an argument for it. Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, you would need to do a certain insane scale. But so if you if we're thinking about the kind of the existing solution on this base, which is essentially about like rainforest protection, right? And like there we have kind of an international carbon market around protecting rain forests, like called web plus. And the basic idea there is like you're rewarding countries for avoiding deforestation. So and like the most significant example of this is like between Norway and Brazil, where like Norway kind of tried to like pay Brazil lots of money to kind of like, yeah, save kind of like deforest less. And the problem with that is I think fundamentally that you're rewarding something you can't observe, like you're rewarding counterfactual, like you're rewarding, of additionally avoided deforestation, which is not something you can observe, right? So like your and so like that is kind of hard on the best case. And it's like, essentially impossible when you have like sovereign nation states that all can kind of have their own, their own estimates. So that's one of the problems. And the other problem, of course, is kind of a snot. Like the main benefit of like avoiding deforestation comes from the long term again, right? So like, but you can't really have like credible, credible commitments over like decades in terms of protecting trees. So like it's a solution that like looks seductively simple, but kind of in practice, kind of doesn't work. Yeah, so like that's kind of the case for avoiding deforestation and for planting trees. Yeah, I mean, you need to do those on an extremely massive scale. And like, it's not going to have large effects kind of in the, in the short term. Yeah, are there any other non technological options that you like, or that you find promising? There's lots of other things we can do, right? So like, I think one thing that we should talk about briefly would be climate finance. So which is essentially the idea of like incentivizing lower income countries for like building or like paying essentially paying more clean energy infrastructure. Yeah, in principle, that's one of the things that you would expect if we had a global carbon market, right? Because like abating abating emissions should be cheaper in a lower income country. So that's another approach of kind of a software from many of the problems I've now talked about with regards to with regards to rainforest protection. So that's another approach that I think we should mention. And then there's kind of when you're kind of in a situation where you have a lot of growth happening, right? So if you're kind of an emerging Asia right now, there is a lot of variance and like how emission intensive that growth can be. So like we've just hired a carbon looking specialist who like she will kind of look at what what are the interventions we can do there. But like if you kind of look at the literature, you can kind of see like clear differences related to, yeah, like how our city is being built and these kind of things like kind of shape essentially shaping long run behavioral patterns by like different forms of infrastructure investments. Yeah, and you mentioned supporting innovation or innovation policy. And that's kind of ties to what we've talked about before, right, which is like, the government is essential for technological transformation. What the government does can be affected by advocacy, you can kind of fund through like where you can find a charity to do this kind of work. And it is it locks it kind of souls for this like what I described is like the central conundrum of climate policy, right, that kind of essentially the gas that you have like way more leverage through innovation on like global emission outcomes than like through their territorial emissions. So you have this potential for trajectory changing dynamics, right, that we've kind of been discussing with the example of solar electric cars et cetera that relatively small changes in the world, like in the large in the grand scheme of things, right, like California aggressively supporting electric cars or Denmark aggressively supporting wind power, these are like small changes on the world but like huge long term consequences. So I think that's kind of the thing and like the other things that I would mention, so like kind of on the on the carbon carbon lock inside would be stuff like, yeah, essentially regulatory reform, right. And the US this would be something like permitting reform, which which will become like a hot issue or is already becoming a hot issue because the financing for clean energy is there but the permits and the regulation is not there. And they're similar similar issues and like emerging emerging economies. So it's not all about technological innovation, not at all. Right. It's also about like, yeah, shaping the regulatory frameworks, etc. And here you're using some amount of money in order to influence a much bigger amount of money. Basically, you're using philanthropic dollars to influence the dollars or the money spent by governments. Yeah. So for everything that we're kind of funding and there's always there's always kind of advocacy and the broader sense of the term. So I'm kind of saying essentially, using philanthropy to influence much larger budgets, right? And like like that reasoning comes from the fact that like, all government budgets are like several orders of magnitude, like two to three orders of magnitudes, larger than philanthropy. And also, I think what we've already touched on, right, like, there's things that kind of essentially need the government, even if it's like changing regulation, etc. Right. So like, most impact focused philanthropy and climate is ultimately about kind of shaping actions of the government, you know, or other large actors. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I do wonder, though, aren't there a lot of kind of interest groups trying to get the government to spend money on on various things. And so you might there might be a lot of competition for influence over over the government's resources. When I just talked about like the different sizes of the changes in the world, that kind of relates relates to this. So I think that the best case or like the kind of the highest impact case for like philanthropy to have like a large impact on government policy is kind of in situations where there's like relatively little attention, right? So like, if we're kind of thinking about the counter example of like the carbon tax, like needs national attention needs like bipartisan support to be passed definitely needs national conversation. Like that's probably a situation where like an additional fund traffic dollar will not make a large difference because kind of like lots of other money is involved. But when you're kind of in a situation where like, you know, okay, we're going to pass this big climate bill. And like, there's a big national conversation about we want to do this, the climate bill, but ultimately, like how exactly does this climate bill look like, which technology does support and how that is kind of a thing, the sweet spot for kind of philanthropy, right, because we're essentially lots of political science literature for like how this kind of works. It's what's called like legislative subsidy. So there's kind of special charities that kind of specialize and like knowing which legislation would be needed to kind of promote a given technology or given approach. And yeah, essentially providing providing that knowledge to the policymakers. So I think that's kind of a way in which in which charities can have a large influence and kind of policy fields that are less politicized and that are kind of like under, yeah, that are kind of not not not super not super crowded. Yeah, let's give an overview of the different climate scenarios. So what's most likely to happen with the climate and specifically, I think we should talk about the worst cases and how likely those are. If you kind of look at the forecast, there's something like one third probability that we will kind of meet global climate targets. So that would be like limiting warming to two degrees. Then there's kind of about another third for something like between two, two and three degrees. And then there's kind of another third for everything kind of above three degrees from up to like five degrees. So this is kind of from a we can we can link this in the show notes, but like that's kind of from an from an LSE paper that kind of try to try to estimate those last year. And but like, there's different ways to estimate this, but it's kind of like broadly, broadly consistent. So like, we're probably not in current trajectory is not going to meet the global climate targets. We're gonna overshoot them by a degree or so. At the same time, right, kind of the really extreme scenarios, like six degrees or something like that has become like, very, very significantly less likely compared to what we believe like five or six years ago. Yeah, maybe you could describe some of the effects of the these different degrees of heating. It's a bit abstract when we're talking in terms of degrees, could you describe some of the effects of different degrees of heating? I mean, again, like this is of course an area where there's always like huge uncertainties, right? So like, we're like, if you look at the bars, like when do certain phenomena starts is kind of always like, okay, this could start at two degrees, because start at four and five degrees. I mean, the thing that we're kind of like right now, we're kind of in a situation where we can, where we can essentially see climate change in our daily lives, right, where kind of the temperature extremes have clearly changed. Also, like where like many, not all, but like kind of many kind of natural disasters have a climate change signal on there, right? So it kind of become more likely or more intense related to climate change. So that's kind of where we are right now. It's broadly kind of, I guess, probably think these things have become more, more intense. Then if you're kind of, I guess if you're hitting two degrees or more than like tipping point, tipping points become somewhat more likely. So there are elements in the climate system that either would kind of have like local environment effects or like dieback on the Amazon, for example, or kind of have like global climate effects, like shifting global temperature up by a half a degree or something of that sort. So those kind of things become kind of become happening, happening more as we moving higher up. Yeah, I think that's kind of the main thing. So I would say this is pretty abstract. The reason for that is this is not really what I'm not really spending a lot of time on that. I'm mostly interested, like, give them what I'm doing day to day, I'm mostly interested in understanding the shape of the curve, and how likely the different futures are because that's kind of what's most relevant for me to prioritize. And so are you prioritizing the worst case scenarios? No. And I'm really happy that you asked this because this is a very typical misunderstanding. So what I'm essentially arguing for and I will talk about this, which we can also link like on the structure of climate risk and its implications for high impact philanthropy. What I'm essentially asked arguing for is we treat this the same that we will treat other problems. So like, we're essentially looking at expected damage, right? So like an expected damage is the product of two different things is like the probability of different futures and how bad those futures would be. And right now, most of the probability mass, so when we put these things together, based on the current estimates would be on the other side, I think, like above, like most of the damage would be above 2.5 to 3.5. But crucially, it would not be in like six degrees or more. Because that's like, even though those worlds will be extremely damaging, they've become so much less likely that they're so that kind of the degree, like the low likelihood kind of dominates the strength of the signal. So it's not about just focusing on the worst world is kind of taking an expected damage. And the alternative to this, that I'm criticizing is essentially much of the focus of the climate community, where it's like, black and white, like either we meet the goal of the Paris Agreement or we don't, like there's all of this massive complexity that you talked about. And we're just reducing it to, okay, on a two degree trajectory, we will need this and this and this. And like, that's kind of, I guess, in a way, the wrong question. Where do you see the most expected damage then? Yeah, so and the last time we ran these numbers, and we should run them again this year. But like, it's kind of, I think, in those worlds that are both reasonably likely, and also much more like significantly more damaging than kind of the best case worlds, right? So they will be like worlds of like 2.5 to 3.5 degrees, roughly, that's kind of where the bulk of the damages. So those are worlds where the Paris Agreement has not succeeded, right? Because me, the Paris Agreement's goal is to limit temperature to two degrees. They're also like worlds where like, yeah, some things must must clearly have gone wrong. They're also not worlds like those worlds are not consistent with like, super cheap renewables, easy seasonal storage, etc. Yeah. Yeah. And in those worlds, what are the most promising interventions to alleviate the expected damage? The method here is, let's think about, because we're in a situation of extreme uncertainty, about lots of different things, like how much our economy is going to grow, how carbon tensiles is going to be, how will different technologies play out, how strong will the climate react? And all of these things are highly uncertain. But we're trying to understand, what do we know about the structure here? Like, what do we know? What is more likely to be true in a worse world, essentially? So like, on the technological level, or we already talked about this, right? So like, okay, a typical, like there's kind of two, two typical, or two, I think, failure moods that people would expect. Like one is kind of like, renewables do not scale as much. Another would kind of be that electrification doesn't scale as much, right? So that's kind of related. So if renewables don't scale as much, then like, the clean firm power sources that we talked about, right, those are kind of, we're gonna play a relatively larger role. So like, a significant part of the motivation of like, investing in geothermal, investing in advanced nuclear kind of comes not all of it, but like, comes from that. There's of course, also like other aspects to this, right? It's not only about the choice of energy technology, it's also about like, different kinds of solutions. So if you're kind of thinking about those futures, like those are not futures, where, as a side, like, international cooperation on climate, like being in a great shape is not consistent with being in the 3.5 world. So that means that things that kind of maybe look very good on the best case, right? Like if the best case is kind of like the case that we're in right now, or probably even better, let's say, saving trees on the Amazon, like, if we could kind of get this to work, right? Like, even if that were very cheap, and the best case where we solve this regulatory problem that so far, we were not able to solve. Now, that's not going to work in this kind of world, right? So, so, so that's, I think, something that's kind of contraindicated on this case, right? So it's kind of like, this will look worse. And similarly, if you kind of think about the structure of the world economy, like, and kind of like the future for predictions, you probably have like, more of the higher warming worlds are like, in situations where like emerging economies have been growing very strongly, right? So like, yeah, we're making us like, let's say Africa is kind of growing, and growing very strong. So it also tells us something about like, regional prioritization, some level, I think actually, that's, that's a great segue to where I would like to, to, to end this conversation by talking about kind of interactions between climates and, and other areas we could call them. What are the tradeoffs between economic development and emissions? Yeah, so that depends on where you are with regards to economic development. So there's a very strong relationship between economic development or human development more generally, and use of energy. And that's like, not like a one direction causation, right? So like, we shouldn't say like, more energy causes more development. But we should say that it would be very surprising that the world gets a lot richer without losing a lot more energy. So I think that's very clear. And like, there's papers on that that show this very clearly. And like, it's like kind of really, really strong kind of relationship. And the relationship is much, much stronger in the earlier part of the ladder, right? So like, high income countries right now are able to grow without growing their emissions, right? So there's like, about 20, 25 countries or so that have been able to grow over the last decade, grow the GDP without growing their emissions, what would be kind of like the, the weak kind of condition of decoupling, right? It's kind of not doesn't mean they will meet their climate goals, but it kind of means that kind of growth is kind of possible without increasing emissions. But that is not true on the, on the lower end, right? And like, broadly for, for three reasons, if you're kind of very energy poor, then like, so if you can kind of save more energy, like energy efficiency gains, etc. will just use like probably translate into into more energy use. I think that's kind of one reason there's two other ones. So one is kind of like earlier economic development is kind of more, more carbon intensive, right? So it requires stuff like that requires little steel and cement, the kind of stuff that's kind of hard to decarbonize right now, or which we actually have not decarbonized to this point at like, reasonable cost. So that's kind of another aspect to this. Yeah, so that essentially you're doing lots of infrastructure investments that are very early. And of course, also like the willingness to pay for climate policy is like, very low and rightly so very low if you're not in a very energy poor context, right? If you're in India and have like 400 million people without access to electricity, then like the first thing that you're thinking about is not implementing a carbon tax. And so we mentioned one very large benefit of using less oil and coal, which is to add, which is a decrease in air pollution. Do you think there are other additional benefits? Here I'm thinking in terms of greater food stability or less conflict or something like that? I would call it the more sophisticated case about caring about climate change is probably less about like extreme weather events and the like the dire impacts of extreme weather events, but more like political instability and conflict, especially in places that are heavily dependent on like, well, environmental conditions, right, right? So if you kind of in sub-Saharan Africa, and you have like rain-fed agriculture, like that is probably the most likely case where you can get social destabilization because of climate change, because you're like the vulnerability is very high. So yeah, I think that's kind of an important effect. This seems like very important from like, like, ethically speaking, from a perspective of like, okay, this is like climate change is hurting the global poor the most. And like, it's kind of the most destabilizing probably in those in those areas. So I think that's a very important effect. And something that I think effective altruists, it's easy for effective altruists to forget that, because in a way, if you kind of think about climate as a civilizational risk, I think I would agree that the civilizational risk aspect of climate is kind of low, because it's kind of hard to imagine a great power war because of climate change. And I guess, like, if you're kind of caring about the long term future, like great power wars are just like, extraordinarily important. But kind of from the from the more near term suffering perspective, like, I think that's a very significant effect. And another one that comes more from essentially making clean energy cheap, right, is kind of thought like reducing energy poverty. So I just, I just mentioned, like, I guess 400 million people in India, not having access to electricity, right? So like, we're living in a world where like, what we are thinking about first when we're reducing emissions, right, like we can use we can all use a lot less energy, without like, sacrificing a lot of our living standards. But we're not living in a globally representative part of the world. Both of us and I think most listeners. So it's kind of a very different situation, like the average human on this planet is like very energy poor and like, we're the human development benefits of access to more energy are very significant. Yeah, so and ideally if it's quite clean and cheap energy, that's the ideal, ideal case. Yeah, that's a great point. Your Highness, thanks for coming on the podcast. It's been a real pleasure.
