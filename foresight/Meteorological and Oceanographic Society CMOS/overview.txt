1. RÃ©nel presented the adjustment of sea ice extent forecasts using artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The presentation focused on the comparison between raw forecasts, bias-adjusted forecasts, and a unit forecast based on both the Sea Ice Extent (SIE) and the sea ice concentration (SIC). Key metrics like mean error, root mean square error, and hit rate were used to assess performance.

2. The bias-adjusted forecast showed improvements over the raw forecast in terms of mean error, hit rate, and mean hit rate, but it still underperformed compared to the unit forecast, particularly for the CIS extent metric.

3. There is a predictability barrier after spring that affects the skill of all forecasts, including the bias-adjusted and unit forecasts, especially around June to October.

4. Training the model on specific months or lead times could potentially improve the forecast by focusing on the seasonality and information relevant to the biases and errors present in those periods.

5. The presentation highlighted that while AI methods have shown promise in improving sea ice forecasts, there are still challenges, especially related to the temporal dependence of the forecasts and the predictability barrier associated with sea ice eyes formation and melting.

6. A second part of the session is planned for later, with more presentations from different experts, including those from outside ECCC (Environment and Climate Change Canada). The audience was encouraged to join the next session to continue learning about advancements in AI for weather and climate forecasting.

 It seems like you're outlining a research project focused on understanding the microclimate differences that affect fire weather variables in different stand types of forests in British Columbia, particularly in the context of wildfire skips observed during the significant wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Your presentation includes an overview of the study design, the methodology used for measuring weather and microclimate conditions, and the significance of these measurements in predicting fire behavior and risk.

Here's a summary of the key points from your presentation:

1. **Background**: The research was initiated due to wildfires in 2017 and 2018 in British Columbia that revealed phenomena called wildfire skips, where juvenile forest areas were less burned compared to older, more mature forests.

2. **Research Objective**: To investigate the microclimate differences that could affect fire weather variables and contribute to the relative resistance of juvenile pine plantations to high-intensity wildfires compared to older stands.

3. **Study Area**: The study includes six field-based sites, three around Smithers and three near Prince George in British Columbia.

4. **Study Design**: A comparative approach is used by directly comparing weather and microclimate conditions in both open stands and forested stands that are similar in terms of forest types.

5. **Methodology**: The study uses a variety of measurement tools, including onset hobo microstations for surface temperature, UNBC-supplied Campbell Scientific weather stations with Sierra 300 loggers, rain buckets, and direction smart sensors for wind speed and direction measurements.

6. **Data Collection**: The equipment is run year-round to collect data that can inform the start and end of the snow season, which is crucial for initiating fire weather index codes.

7. **Findings**: Initial data from two years indicate that open stands have higher surface temperatures and wind speeds compared to mature stands. This may contribute to a higher fine-fuel moisture code, duff moisture code, and drought code, reflecting the severe wildfire season experienced in British Columbia in 2020.

8. **Future Work**: There is an intention to improve measurements for upcoming years, particularly with regard to snow measurement, and to continue analyzing data to understand the nature of precipitation patterns and their impact on fire weather variables.

9. **Next Steps**: Dr. Mandelbrock will discuss scaling properties of precipitation and how these might influence the probability space of fire weather events, which is a crucial aspect of predicting and managing wildfire risk.

Your presentation aims to contribute valuable insights into forest management practices, fire hazard assessment, and the development of more accurate and effective fire weather forecasting models. The findings from this research could have significant implications for the safety and preparedness of communities in wildfire-prone areas.
