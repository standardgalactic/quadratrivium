1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
So, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:15,720
This let me put up, let me share the screen.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,000
That's okay.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,360
And I will show the schedule for today.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,280
That's good.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,840
Under the multidisciplinary section where we are entertaining a number of interesting

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,640
topics here in this session and in the following session.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,560
On behalf of everyone, welcome and let me acknowledge the unceded territories of the

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,720
indigenous peoples that we are all tuning in from.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
My source.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
Yeah, sounds good.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,240
Just get my presentation up here.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,560
Just confirming that you're seeing that and hearing me okay.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,920
Yeah, thanks for introducing the session.

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,200
Rationale for this work happened because of significant wildfires that we had in the

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,920
central interior of British Columbia in 2017 and 2018 where it was noticed something called

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,560
wildfire skips where there was juvenile forest that were burned less verily or not at all

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
as shown in that satellite image.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,720
You're probably easy to pick up that nice dark green locations in the middle.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,120
That's juvenile pine plantations that were not burned.

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:52,280
And then on the outskirts, you can see a lot of fire scars and burn trees in older mature

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,600
forests.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,080
This was counter to the understanding that generally older forests are less susceptible

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,360
to high intensity wildfires and that sparked several research projects to investigate.

25
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,080
This work is part of a larger research project led by the University of Northern British

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Columbia on estimating fuel moisture content in different stand types.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,640
My portion of the project is to understand are there microclimate differences that would

28
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,520
affect the fire weather variables to cause the juvenile pine plantations to be less risky

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,880
than the older stands?

30
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,560
So we have six field-based sites to look at this problem.

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,720
Three of the sites are around the community of Smithers, which is in the northwest central

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
part of the province, and then also three around Prince George, which is pretty close

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,960
to the middle of the province of British Columbia.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,720
So showing the sites here on these satellite images, as well as the nearest British Columbia

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,560
wildfire service weather station that we use to compare our field data to.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
So here's what the study design looks like.

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,480
I'll move from left to right in terms of the pictures.

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:17,960
So we have an approach where we're directly comparing weather and microclimate conditions

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
in an open stand.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,560
The open stand is a real difference.

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,600
So the forest types are very similar.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:33,640
So the next picture is an example of some of the in-stand monitoring, where we have these

43
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,960
smaller onset hobo microstamps centimeters above the ground that we use to measure surface

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,360
temperature.

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,680
The third picture is UNBC supplied weather stations, Campbell Scientific-based weather

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,800
stations based on a Sierra 300 logger, and using an all-weather sensor for two of the

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,880
six stations.

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,080
That fourth picture is another in-stand picture of our rain bucket, as well as some of the

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,960
30 centimeter temperature and relative humidity measurements.

50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,520
And then lastly, the direction smart sensor, coupled with an onset microdata logger.

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,600
The wind speed and direction measurements in-stand are also made at three meters, just like

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,720
in our open locations.

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,440
We're not measuring snow.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,640
In this study, snow is really quite difficult to measure directly with sensors.

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,720
However, we do run the equipment year round, and we can tell things like the start of the

56
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,960
snow season, the end of the snow season, and the timing of melts with the data that we

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
leave running.

58
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,960
And that's really important for starting the fire weather index codes.

59
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,880
Here's just an example of what the stands look like overhead.

60
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,560
These are fisheye photos, or some folks call them canopy photos.

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,360
Obviously, the open cells that we've measured directly, we started the measurements.

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,480
And go temperature than the mature stand.

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Wind speed is an important fire weather index variable, so that peaks above 100 millimeters

64
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,000
in April, where we can see the timing of the snow melt.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,040
Surface temperature, we only have two years of data because our cables there, which we

66
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,960
hope to improve our measurements for upcoming years.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,920
Codes on the right, fine-fuel moisture code on the top, duff moisture code in the middle,

68
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,680
and drought code on the bottom, which kind of follow.

69
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,200
We end up generating a much higher drought code throughout the season, kind of as expected.

70
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,000
But this was a lot more reflective of the severe wildfire season that we did experience

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,240
in BC in 2020.

72
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,000
I had about the maturity of the...

73
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,720
I think the way the fire weather variables are calculated is they take the wind speeds

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,800
that are occurring at 12 o'clock, so...

75
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,320
Extreme events in that area.

76
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,120
So, Victor, can you share your screen?

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Right.

78
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Okay.

79
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,720
My agenda for going along with Dr. Mandelbrock, the nature of precipitation patterns on the

80
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
scale.

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,840
So, scaling properties of precipitation help us to understand properties of this probability

82
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
space.

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Options.

84
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
The...
