0	8600	So, welcome everybody.
8600	15720	This let me put up, let me share the screen.
15720	19000	That's okay.
19000	23360	And I will show the schedule for today.
23360	28280	That's good.
28280	34840	Under the multidisciplinary section where we are entertaining a number of interesting
34840	39640	topics here in this session and in the following session.
39640	47560	On behalf of everyone, welcome and let me acknowledge the unceded territories of the
47560	52720	indigenous peoples that we are all tuning in from.
52720	53720	My source.
53720	56680	Yeah, sounds good.
56680	62240	Just get my presentation up here.
62240	65560	Just confirming that you're seeing that and hearing me okay.
65560	70920	Yeah, thanks for introducing the session.
70920	77200	Rationale for this work happened because of significant wildfires that we had in the
77200	85920	central interior of British Columbia in 2017 and 2018 where it was noticed something called
85920	92560	wildfire skips where there was juvenile forest that were burned less verily or not at all
92560	95680	as shown in that satellite image.
95680	100720	You're probably easy to pick up that nice dark green locations in the middle.
100720	104120	That's juvenile pine plantations that were not burned.
104120	112280	And then on the outskirts, you can see a lot of fire scars and burn trees in older mature
112280	114600	forests.
114600	119080	This was counter to the understanding that generally older forests are less susceptible
119080	124360	to high intensity wildfires and that sparked several research projects to investigate.
124360	128080	This work is part of a larger research project led by the University of Northern British
128080	133560	Columbia on estimating fuel moisture content in different stand types.
133600	138640	My portion of the project is to understand are there microclimate differences that would
138640	145520	affect the fire weather variables to cause the juvenile pine plantations to be less risky
145520	148880	than the older stands?
148880	155560	So we have six field-based sites to look at this problem.
155560	160720	Three of the sites are around the community of Smithers, which is in the northwest central
160800	165760	part of the province, and then also three around Prince George, which is pretty close
165760	168960	to the middle of the province of British Columbia.
168960	174720	So showing the sites here on these satellite images, as well as the nearest British Columbia
174720	181560	wildfire service weather station that we use to compare our field data to.
181560	183960	So here's what the study design looks like.
183960	187480	I'll move from left to right in terms of the pictures.
187480	197960	So we have an approach where we're directly comparing weather and microclimate conditions
197960	199280	in an open stand.
199280	202560	The open stand is a real difference.
202560	205600	So the forest types are very similar.
205600	213640	So the next picture is an example of some of the in-stand monitoring, where we have these
213640	218960	smaller onset hobo microstamps centimeters above the ground that we use to measure surface
218960	220360	temperature.
220360	226680	The third picture is UNBC supplied weather stations, Campbell Scientific-based weather
226680	232800	stations based on a Sierra 300 logger, and using an all-weather sensor for two of the
232800	234880	six stations.
234880	240080	That fourth picture is another in-stand picture of our rain bucket, as well as some of the
240080	243960	30 centimeter temperature and relative humidity measurements.
243960	251520	And then lastly, the direction smart sensor, coupled with an onset microdata logger.
251520	256600	The wind speed and direction measurements in-stand are also made at three meters, just like
256600	260720	in our open locations.
260720	263440	We're not measuring snow.
263440	268640	In this study, snow is really quite difficult to measure directly with sensors.
268640	273720	However, we do run the equipment year round, and we can tell things like the start of the
273720	278960	snow season, the end of the snow season, and the timing of melts with the data that we
278960	279960	leave running.
279960	285960	And that's really important for starting the fire weather index codes.
285960	289880	Here's just an example of what the stands look like overhead.
289880	293560	These are fisheye photos, or some folks call them canopy photos.
293560	298360	Obviously, the open cells that we've measured directly, we started the measurements.
299080	304480	And go temperature than the mature stand.
304480	311320	Wind speed is an important fire weather index variable, so that peaks above 100 millimeters
311320	319000	in April, where we can see the timing of the snow melt.
319000	323040	Surface temperature, we only have two years of data because our cables there, which we
323040	326960	hope to improve our measurements for upcoming years.
326960	332920	Codes on the right, fine-fuel moisture code on the top, duff moisture code in the middle,
332920	335680	and drought code on the bottom, which kind of follow.
335680	341200	We end up generating a much higher drought code throughout the season, kind of as expected.
341200	347000	But this was a lot more reflective of the severe wildfire season that we did experience
347000	349240	in BC in 2020.
349240	354000	I had about the maturity of the...
354040	359720	I think the way the fire weather variables are calculated is they take the wind speeds
359720	363800	that are occurring at 12 o'clock, so...
363800	366320	Extreme events in that area.
366320	371120	So, Victor, can you share your screen?
373120	374120	Right.
374120	375120	Okay.
375120	382720	My agenda for going along with Dr. Mandelbrock, the nature of precipitation patterns on the
382720	383720	scale.
383720	389840	So, scaling properties of precipitation help us to understand properties of this probability
389840	390840	space.
390840	391840	Options.
391840	392840	The...
