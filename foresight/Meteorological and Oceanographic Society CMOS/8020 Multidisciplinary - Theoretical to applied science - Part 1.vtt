00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
So, welcome everybody.

00:08.600 --> 00:15.720
This let me put up, let me share the screen.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.000
That's okay.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.360
And I will show the schedule for today.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.280
That's good.

00:28.280 --> 00:34.840
Under the multidisciplinary section where we are entertaining a number of interesting

00:34.840 --> 00:39.640
topics here in this session and in the following session.

00:39.640 --> 00:47.560
On behalf of everyone, welcome and let me acknowledge the unceded territories of the

00:47.560 --> 00:52.720
indigenous peoples that we are all tuning in from.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.720
My source.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.680
Yeah, sounds good.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.240
Just get my presentation up here.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.560
Just confirming that you're seeing that and hearing me okay.

01:05.560 --> 01:10.920
Yeah, thanks for introducing the session.

01:10.920 --> 01:17.200
Rationale for this work happened because of significant wildfires that we had in the

01:17.200 --> 01:25.920
central interior of British Columbia in 2017 and 2018 where it was noticed something called

01:25.920 --> 01:32.560
wildfire skips where there was juvenile forest that were burned less verily or not at all

01:32.560 --> 01:35.680
as shown in that satellite image.

01:35.680 --> 01:40.720
You're probably easy to pick up that nice dark green locations in the middle.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.120
That's juvenile pine plantations that were not burned.

01:44.120 --> 01:52.280
And then on the outskirts, you can see a lot of fire scars and burn trees in older mature

01:52.280 --> 01:54.600
forests.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.080
This was counter to the understanding that generally older forests are less susceptible

01:59.080 --> 02:04.360
to high intensity wildfires and that sparked several research projects to investigate.

02:04.360 --> 02:08.080
This work is part of a larger research project led by the University of Northern British

02:08.080 --> 02:13.560
Columbia on estimating fuel moisture content in different stand types.

02:13.600 --> 02:18.640
My portion of the project is to understand are there microclimate differences that would

02:18.640 --> 02:25.520
affect the fire weather variables to cause the juvenile pine plantations to be less risky

02:25.520 --> 02:28.880
than the older stands?

02:28.880 --> 02:35.560
So we have six field-based sites to look at this problem.

02:35.560 --> 02:40.720
Three of the sites are around the community of Smithers, which is in the northwest central

02:40.800 --> 02:45.760
part of the province, and then also three around Prince George, which is pretty close

02:45.760 --> 02:48.960
to the middle of the province of British Columbia.

02:48.960 --> 02:54.720
So showing the sites here on these satellite images, as well as the nearest British Columbia

02:54.720 --> 03:01.560
wildfire service weather station that we use to compare our field data to.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.960
So here's what the study design looks like.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.480
I'll move from left to right in terms of the pictures.

03:07.480 --> 03:17.960
So we have an approach where we're directly comparing weather and microclimate conditions

03:17.960 --> 03:19.280
in an open stand.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.560
The open stand is a real difference.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.600
So the forest types are very similar.

03:25.600 --> 03:33.640
So the next picture is an example of some of the in-stand monitoring, where we have these

03:33.640 --> 03:38.960
smaller onset hobo microstamps centimeters above the ground that we use to measure surface

03:38.960 --> 03:40.360
temperature.

03:40.360 --> 03:46.680
The third picture is UNBC supplied weather stations, Campbell Scientific-based weather

03:46.680 --> 03:52.800
stations based on a Sierra 300 logger, and using an all-weather sensor for two of the

03:52.800 --> 03:54.880
six stations.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.080
That fourth picture is another in-stand picture of our rain bucket, as well as some of the

04:00.080 --> 04:03.960
30 centimeter temperature and relative humidity measurements.

04:03.960 --> 04:11.520
And then lastly, the direction smart sensor, coupled with an onset microdata logger.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.600
The wind speed and direction measurements in-stand are also made at three meters, just like

04:16.600 --> 04:20.720
in our open locations.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.440
We're not measuring snow.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.640
In this study, snow is really quite difficult to measure directly with sensors.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.720
However, we do run the equipment year round, and we can tell things like the start of the

04:33.720 --> 04:38.960
snow season, the end of the snow season, and the timing of melts with the data that we

04:38.960 --> 04:39.960
leave running.

04:39.960 --> 04:45.960
And that's really important for starting the fire weather index codes.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.880
Here's just an example of what the stands look like overhead.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.560
These are fisheye photos, or some folks call them canopy photos.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.360
Obviously, the open cells that we've measured directly, we started the measurements.

04:59.080 --> 05:04.480
And go temperature than the mature stand.

05:04.480 --> 05:11.320
Wind speed is an important fire weather index variable, so that peaks above 100 millimeters

05:11.320 --> 05:19.000
in April, where we can see the timing of the snow melt.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.040
Surface temperature, we only have two years of data because our cables there, which we

05:23.040 --> 05:26.960
hope to improve our measurements for upcoming years.

05:26.960 --> 05:32.920
Codes on the right, fine-fuel moisture code on the top, duff moisture code in the middle,

05:32.920 --> 05:35.680
and drought code on the bottom, which kind of follow.

05:35.680 --> 05:41.200
We end up generating a much higher drought code throughout the season, kind of as expected.

05:41.200 --> 05:47.000
But this was a lot more reflective of the severe wildfire season that we did experience

05:47.000 --> 05:49.240
in BC in 2020.

05:49.240 --> 05:54.000
I had about the maturity of the...

05:54.040 --> 05:59.720
I think the way the fire weather variables are calculated is they take the wind speeds

05:59.720 --> 06:03.800
that are occurring at 12 o'clock, so...

06:03.800 --> 06:06.320
Extreme events in that area.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.120
So, Victor, can you share your screen?

06:13.120 --> 06:14.120
Right.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.120
Okay.

06:15.120 --> 06:22.720
My agenda for going along with Dr. Mandelbrock, the nature of precipitation patterns on the

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
scale.

06:23.720 --> 06:29.840
So, scaling properties of precipitation help us to understand properties of this probability

06:29.840 --> 06:30.840
space.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.840
Options.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.840
The...
