0	6600	What you're looking at, depending on who you ask, is either a revolution for the internet
6600	13000	and countless industries as we know it, or the greatest Ponzi scheme in human history.
13000	18200	The whole thing is a promise that you can get rich for free.
18200	23240	Accused of being all of these things is the world of cryptocurrencies, or the other labels
23240	29800	associated with it, NFTs, blockchains, Web 3.0, from the bizarre onslaught of celebrity
29800	43880	promotions and endorsements, to the eye-watering numbers and headlines, to the grandiose claims
43880	52040	about its potential, I once described the world of cryptocurrencies as a story, and
52040	55000	I did that in hopeful, optimistic tones.
55000	81080	And now, now I don't think it's the story that I initially thought it was.
81080	84800	For me and many others, it began here.
84800	90400	What you're looking at is a piece of artwork by a digital artist called Michael Joseph Winkleman,
90400	91960	otherwise known as Beeple.
91960	96680	On February the 25th of 2021, this artwork was put on auction.
96680	99680	Bidding started at $100.
99680	107400	It eventually sold for $69.3 million, making it one of the biggest sales in digital art
107400	108400	history.
108400	115680	What happened afterwards?
115680	116680	Where do I begin?
116680	122640	A digital artwork by a relatively unknown American artist, sold for nearly $70 million, that's
122640	127360	more than most Picasso's Monet's or Warhol's, that it doesn't exist in physical form, it
127360	129240	is only available digitally.
129240	135480	It's the first NFT ever sold at auction, non-fungible token, NFTs, or non-fungible token,
135840	143200	It was like suddenly the term NFT was just everywhere.
143200	148120	Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sells a picture of his first ever tweet as an NFT.
148120	152880	Jack Dorsey, auctioning his first tweet as digital art, $2.9 million.
152880	158600	Even popular internet memes were selling as this NFT thing, Nyan Cat, $590,000, Charlie
158600	166880	Bit My Finger, $760,999, Disaster Girl, $500,000, Doge, $4 million, Overly Attached Girlfriend,
166880	173400	$411,000, Bad Luck Brian, $36,000, Scumbag Steve, $57,000.
173400	179040	You had singer-songwriter Grime selling $6 million worth of digital art as NFTs?
179040	183640	People were changing their profile pictures on social media to NFTs they had purchased.
183640	186720	It was like flexing an expensive car or a watch.
186720	191880	And then suddenly all these big celebrities and artists and influences were also replacing
191880	196720	their profile pictures with NFTs and announcing their own purchases of NFTs.
196720	197720	And the apes?
197720	202360	The apes were part of this bigger project of NFTs called Board Ape Yacht Club.
202360	207480	I mean, you had Snoop Dogg, Eminem, DJ Khaled, Lil Baby, Post Malone, Stephen Curry, Gwyneth
207480	212840	Paltrow, to name a few, all of them purchasing these pictures of apes for sometimes hundreds
212840	214160	of thousands of dollars.
214160	219040	And amongst this sea of high ticket sales, you would hear that this is all part of something
219040	220040	revolutionary.
220040	224440	It's the biggest technology that's ever happened in the history of life, outside of things
224440	225440	like fire.
225440	230760	Regardless of how much you knew about NFTs, there was one message that was really clear.
230760	235000	Behind every story, every headline, there was an underlying premise.
235000	238880	Something is happening and there is a lot of money to be made.
238880	242320	Welcome back to the show and congrats on getting married.
242800	243800	This is a big deal.
243800	247800	The last time you were on the show, I asked you to explain NFTs.
247800	252360	So popular talk show host Jimmy Fallon does this segment on his show with Paris Hilton
252360	255200	where they show off their pictures of Board Apes.
255200	256200	This is your apes?
256200	257200	We debuted.
257200	258200	That's really cool.
258200	259200	The hat, the shades.
259200	260200	We're part of the same community.
260200	261200	We're both apes.
261200	262200	Love it.
262200	263200	This is my apes.
263200	264200	This is yours.
264200	265200	Yours is so cool.
265200	266200	I love the Red Heart sunglasses.
266200	267200	I love the Captain hat.
267200	269200	It reminded me of me a little bit.
269200	270200	Look at this.
270200	271200	They look like they could be friends.
271200	272200	They're buddies.
272200	283200	This was the point in which I started to wonder, okay, what is actually happening?
283200	286200	And I think a lot of people started to as well.
286200	291200	You start to realize that the purchase of Beeple's artwork, that wasn't done through
291200	293200	$69.3 million in cash.
293200	296200	That purchase was made using crypto currencies.
296200	301200	In fact, all the NFT purchases that we were seeing, they were done through cryptocurrency.
301200	306200	The mysterious individual who purchased Beeple's artwork that went by the pseudonym MetaCovid
306200	311200	turns out it's this guy called Vignesh Sundaresan who is already a cryptocurrency entrepreneur
311200	315200	and had a working relationship with Beeple months prior to the big sale.
315200	320200	And whilst there was all this talk about the revolutionary potential behind what we're
320200	324200	seeing, there was another side of the story that was being painted by people who are far
324200	327200	skeptical and those voices had a clear warning.
327200	330200	What you are witnessing is a mania.
330200	334200	We've got this system that is gleefully and gloriously corrupt.
334200	337200	A mania that is being driven by greed.
337200	341200	Get rich quick by investing in crypto currency.
341200	342200	Mass delusion.
342200	344200	My ape is an inner reflection of myself.
344200	350200	Or, as other critics put it, it is a giant scam that has some of the largest names, brands,
350200	353200	venture capital firms backing it knowingly or not.
353200	359200	NFTs were just a component of a much bigger machine with a lot of moving pieces.
359200	365200	And when you put those pieces together, it creates a machine for one of the greatest scams in human history.
365200	372200	And it all begins here with a mysterious invention and a failed revolution.
374200	376200	2008.
376200	378200	That's where this really begins.
378200	380200	Apple shares are just getting hammered this morning.
380200	383200	We're down by between three and four and a half percent, generally.
383200	387200	The United States is going through a recession it hasn't seen since the Great Depression.
387200	389200	The consumers strangle.
389200	391200	They're watching their housing prices go lower.
391200	393200	They're watching their 401Ks get diminished.
393200	396200	You created the mess we're in and now you're saying, sorry.
396200	402200	Amongst the backdrop of this all, a mysterious individual is working on their own invention.
402200	406200	On the 31st of October, they send an email to a cryptography mailing list.
406200	407200	The email begins.
407200	413200	I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer with no trusted third party.
413200	417200	It was signed by somebody under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
417200	421200	Whoever this Nakamoto person was, they had a vision.
421200	428200	The vision was to create a type of currency that existed digitally that could be controlled by no government or single individual
428200	433200	that could be used to transact in globally no matter where you were or what time it was.
433200	435200	The name of this currency and invention?
436200	438200	Bitcoin.
438200	445200	On January the 3rd, 2009, Nakamoto launches his invention, creating the first ever Bitcoins to exist.
445200	451200	It was an attractive pitch, you know, especially to people who held anti-state control sentiments.
451200	455200	We're talking about anarchists, techno-anarchists, libertarians, cypher-punks.
455200	461200	These were individuals who likely saw the government, the banks, the entire financial institution as just untrustworthy.
461200	465200	That they can't be allowed to control monetary policy.
465200	470200	And it was these factions that became the first adopters of Bitcoin influencing its early culture.
470200	472200	The goal was simple.
472200	476200	Preach the message of Bitcoin to others and increase its adoption.
476200	480200	Bitcoin was kind of like a religion of its own, right?
480200	486200	Like Satoshi Nakamoto was this Jesus-like figure that would communicate with his disciples on online forums.
486200	491200	We would talk of this future vision of the world, you know, one where the dollar no longer existed
491200	497200	and all transactions would be made through Bitcoin, the global currency of the people that was owned by no central entity.
497200	503200	To those early adopters of Bitcoin, they really felt like they were on the cusp of something revolutionary.
503200	509200	It just so happened that the more people started buying into the message, the higher Bitcoin's value rose
509200	513200	and the more people were willing to like put real dollars into buying Bitcoins.
513200	516200	Bitcoin is now up to $111.
516200	521200	Bitcoin started drawing attention from places it probably wasn't expecting or even wanting.
521200	526200	The guys in suits, you know, the big money, the people who saw Bitcoin as revolutionary
526200	529200	but perhaps more importantly as an opportunity.
529200	532200	The Winklevoss twins were a perfect example of that.
532200	535200	I mean, here you have two twins who have graduated from Harvard.
535200	541200	They've won a settlement for $65 million against Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their initial idea of Facebook.
541200	546200	They found out about Bitcoin on a holiday trip to Ibiza and they started buying as much as they could.
546200	548200	They were stockpiling the currency.
548200	554200	It was by around 2013 that they were rumored to own about 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation.
554200	558200	That, I think, was a perfect early warning of what was to come.
560200	562200	Bitcoin was doomed from the start.
562200	565200	That's what a lot of crypto skeptics will tell you and I understand why.
565200	573200	Relying on computer code and the ideals of tech anarchists probably isn't the best place to entrust a reimagining of the financial system.
573200	578200	Bitcoin had a fixed supply of 21 million coins which makes it deflationary by nature.
578200	584200	So if one Bitcoin is worth more tomorrow than it is today, why would you want to use it to transact with?
584200	588200	It's a pretty bad incentive to have if you're trying to make a global currency.
588200	594200	But that is already assuming that Bitcoin had the technical capabilities to become this worldwide currency,
594200	595200	which it didn't.
595200	600200	Bitcoin had scaling issues thanks to design decisions that Nakamoto themselves had made.
600200	606200	It could only process 7 transactions per second compared to other traditional payment networks like Visa,
606200	612200	which can process 1700 transactions per second, or Mastercard, which handles 5000 transactions per second,
612200	617200	and keeping the Bitcoin network running wasted a lot of energy.
617200	623200	Bitcoin aimed to be decentralized, meaning no government or single entity had control over it.
623200	628200	In order to do that, Nakamoto employed what is called a proof-of-work consensus model.
628200	635200	All this meant was that computers on the Bitcoin network would be forced to use real-world energy in order to solve algorithmic problems,
635200	639200	and whichever computers solved the problem first would be rewarded with more Bitcoins.
639200	644200	It was a process called mining, and that process is insanely wasteful of energy.
644200	645200	And what ends up happening?
645200	650200	Proof-of-work incentivized this arms race between computers on the Bitcoin network,
650200	655200	all of them looking to build more and more powerful computers to have a better chance of mining Bitcoin.
655200	659200	And the more powerful those computers grew, the more real-world energy they ended up taking,
659200	662200	despite the fact that the transactions per second remained the same.
662200	668200	Most Bitcoin mining done today is done by huge mining farms in warehouses.
668200	673200	Bitcoin, for the most part, failed in its objective of trying to become a global currency.
673200	678200	Outside of illegal use purposes, Bitcoin just wasn't being used to transact with.
678200	681200	So the obvious question becomes how?
681200	687200	How is it that despite its failings, Bitcoin still survived and is very much present to this day?
687200	689200	But that's just the thing.
689200	693200	The Bitcoin that we see today is a shell of its former identity,
693200	697200	where most of the purchasing of Bitcoin today happens on centralized exchanges
697200	700200	that have to comply with the laws of centralized institutions.
700200	706200	In the instances where you've heard about Bitcoin, or if you've ever been encouraged to buy Bitcoin,
706200	709200	under what context is that always framed?
709200	716200	By 2014, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto effectively vanished from the Internet and hasn't been heard from since.
716200	722200	What was left of his invention was no longer a currency, it was something entirely different.
724200	725200	Bernie Madoff.
725200	728200	This was a guy who was well respected on Wall Street.
728200	731200	He ran a brokerage firm with a wealth management branch.
731200	736200	He had many clients investing with his firm under the promise of great returns on their money until...
736200	744200	The FBI arrested him this morning after he told senior employees yesterday that his business was a giant Ponzi scheme.
744200	750200	Madoff had been running the largest Ponzi scheme in history for the last 17 years and potentially longer,
750200	753200	worth around $64.8 billion.
753200	759200	He would essentially put his investors' money inside a bank account and then simply pay out early investors
759200	761200	with the money that new investors were giving.
761200	766200	Now Madoff eventually pleaded guilty and he was imprisoned up until his death in 2021.
766200	769200	That is the essence of any Ponzi scheme.
769200	774200	People invest into the scheme under this promise that they're going to make a great amount of returns
774200	778200	and then early investors are paid using the money of new investors.
778200	785200	And this process is repeated on and on until eventually you run out of new recruits to keep investing money into the scheme
785200	788200	or eventually people start trying to cash out and it just collapses,
788200	795200	which tends to leave early investors with profits and the large majority of others with nothing but losses.
795200	798200	People hearing about Bitcoin would hear about two things.
798200	802200	One, that it was revolutionary and two, that it was a valuable.
802200	805200	That if you buy now, you could be rich later.
805200	813200	If you really, really want to become wealthy in the future, I suggest you take one fricking dollar, buy some Bitcoin.
813200	815200	Bitcoin to me, it's not just an investment.
815200	821200	It's not just a maybe a get rich quick scheme as a lot of people put it, but I see it as the future of currency.
821200	823200	I see it as the future of the financial system.
823200	828200	So you realize that most of the people buying Bitcoin, they're not buying it to use as a currency.
828200	833200	They're buying it as an investment and therein lies the contradiction.
833200	838200	Because the more people who used Bitcoin like an investment, the less liable Bitcoin became as a currency,
838200	842200	the very thing it's being pitched as being revolutionary as.
842200	844200	So you know what you end up with, right?
844200	846200	Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme.
846200	851200	The promise is you can get rich for free, magical internet money.
851200	856200	Anyone who buys into the idea of Bitcoin is doing so to sell it for a higher price at a future date
856200	861200	and the people that buy it off those people are also looking to sell it for a higher price at a future date.
861200	866200	The only way to make money from your Bitcoin investment is using the money of new investors.
866200	869200	You hear about people making money in Bitcoin.
869200	874200	They only make money because some other sucker lost more.
874200	879200	And unlike Bernie Madoff, right, who gets all the blame and the satisfying jail time at the end of his story,
879200	886200	here you have an entity that isn't owned by anyone or some would argue isn't a decentralized currency.
886200	888200	It's a decentralized Ponzi scheme.
888200	894200	Now Ponzi schemes are kept alive by continuously finding new recruits and new markets to tap into
894200	897200	so that money is continuously being poured into the scheme.
897200	901200	And so you start to see this similar incentive develop in the crypto space.
901200	904200	This desperate need to find a use case for this stuff.
904200	908200	And that use case has to be revolutionary enough to justify its rising value.
908200	916200	Bitcoin may have been the first part of this machine, but things were about to get a whole lot more interesting.
916200	918200	Bitcoin had something going for it.
918200	922200	The blockchain system that kept it running was somewhat unique.
922200	924200	Okay, so let's not complicate things, right?
924200	930200	You can think of Bitcoin like a digital spreadsheet that records transactions being used in the currency.
930200	933200	It's not a physical coin. It's just data on a database.
933200	940200	After a certain number of transactions are made, a brand new spreadsheet is created that links to the previous one and on and on and on it goes.
940200	945200	Instead of using real names, users are recognized through what are called wallet addresses,
945200	948200	which appear as a random string of numbers and letters.
948200	954200	And all of this is kind of kept together using computer code, cryptography, and the network of miners that are running it,
954200	957200	which is where the word cryptocurrency comes from.
957200	963200	So what was essentially just an immutable, append-only database was touted as revolutionary.
963200	966200	You know, blockchain was no longer just blockchain, it was blockchain technology.
966200	972200	And it wasn't long before people started to see the success and the ideals that Bitcoin was based off
972200	976200	and begin creating their own cryptocurrencies using this blockchain system.
979200	985200	Vitalik Buterin, a teenager who decided to quit his favorite video game at World of Warcraft
985200	989200	after his Warlock character had a damaged component removed by the game developers.
989200	992200	Vitalik says that he cried himself to sleep that night.
992200	996200	That was the day that he realized the horrors that centralized services bring.
996200	1002200	It sounds a bit ridiculous, but Vitalik would end up discovering Bitcoin in 2011
1002200	1004200	and he would start writing for a Bitcoin magazine.
1004200	1006200	It all appealed to his ideals.
1006200	1014200	In 2015, Vitalik and several other co-founders launched the creation of their own blockchain-based invention.
1014200	1015200	It was called Ethereum.
1015200	1021200	Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum had its own blockchain and it had its own native currency, which was called Ether.
1021200	1023200	There was one important difference, though.
1023200	1029200	You see, Ethereum allowed its users to actually program applications on its blockchain.
1029200	1035200	Put it this way, if Bitcoin was like a spreadsheet, then Ethereum was like an Excel spreadsheet
1035200	1039200	that allowed users to create functions to perform various different tasks.
1039200	1041200	It was, you know, a little more advanced.
1041200	1047200	It was a glimpse of hope at finding the revolutionary use cases the cryptocurrency world needed
1047200	1050200	in order to justify the growing value that was being pumped into the system.
1050200	1055200	So, what was the first thing that people started using Ethereum for?
1055200	1057200	Creating more cryptocurrencies.
1057200	1063200	And today we will be creating our own cryptocurrency in under 10 or maybe even under 5 minutes.
1063200	1068200	Rather than needing to create your own blockchain and network, you could just use Ethereum's blockchain
1068200	1072200	to create your own cryptocurrencies or crypto assets, as people called them.
1072200	1077200	These assets that existed without their own native blockchain were called tokens.
1077200	1080200	There are now over 1500 cryptocurrencies.
1080200	1083200	It became known as the ICO mania.
1083200	1086200	It was supposed to be this new way to fund your business.
1086200	1090200	Businesses could create their own token coins, release what is called a whitepaper,
1090200	1095200	which explains what the project aimed to do, and then they could sell those tokens to the public.
1095200	1098200	Otherwise known as an initial coin offering, ICO.
1098200	1102200	A whole wave of these token coins were being released.
1102200	1105200	Some of them parodies and others were just blatant scams.
1105200	1106200	It's coin.
1106200	1107200	The Whopper coin.
1107200	1108200	Trump coin.
1108200	1109200	Kodak coin.
1109200	1110200	Insane coin.
1110200	1111200	But here it is.
1111200	1112200	I created a dictator coin.
1112200	1117200	Jesus coin was a token coin that was promising to decentralize Jesus on the blockchain.
1117200	1119200	On its whitepaper, its creators stated,
1119200	1124200	they were in early talks with churches to provide miracles exclusively to Jesus coin owners.
1124200	1128200	Ponzi coin was very much open about the fact that it was a scam.
1128200	1130200	Their website literally said it right there.
1130200	1135200	It's as much as a scam as 99% of the ICOs out there, but it's more transparent about it.
1135200	1139200	Ponzi coin still managed to raise $250,000.
1139200	1142200	It didn't matter if the idea was good enough or not,
1142200	1144200	or if it even solved the problems it was claiming to solve.
1144200	1147200	All that mattered was that people believed in the token enough
1147200	1151200	so that the value would rise and it would pay off the early investors who got in at the start.
1151200	1155200	There was one that you invested in that saw like 2,000% growth last month.
1155200	1156200	Yep.
1156200	1157200	What was it?
1157200	1158200	That was Dabber coin.
1158200	1163200	It also marked the beginning of an unlikely friendship between those in the cryptocurrency space
1163200	1165200	and influencers and celebrities.
1165200	1168200	If token coins were fueled by hype and attention,
1168200	1172200	then celebrities and influencers were the ones that were running the gas stations.
1172200	1176200	Famous professional boxer Floyd Mayweather along with producer DJ Khaled
1176200	1183200	were paid $100,000 and $50,000 respectively to promote the token coin Centratec in 2017.
1183200	1189200	Centratec was a project that was promising to deliver financial services to the cryptocurrency world.
1189200	1191200	The coin had raised $32 million.
1191200	1196200	Turns out they lied about their CEO who wasn't even a real person that existed.
1196200	1199200	They lied about business deals with Mastercard and Visa
1199200	1203200	and its co-founder Sam Sharma was eventually sentenced to eight years in prison.
1203200	1208200	ICOs effectively became a casino to gamble unregistered securities,
1208200	1211200	but you have to remember the hidden incentives.
1211200	1215200	No matter how fraudulent or bizarre everything looks on the outside in the crypto world,
1215200	1218200	you have to keep clushing at potential use cases
1218200	1223200	or anything that will justify its value constantly rising to new investors.
1223200	1226200	And whilst the ICO mania of 2017 was continuing,
1226200	1229200	a whole new idea was coming to fruition.
1230200	1233200	So how many of y'all have heard of this new game that came out recently?
1233200	1236200	I don't know how do we actually describe what these things are.
1236200	1238200	And today we're talking about crypto kitties.
1238200	1243200	Crypto kitties was probably one of the first NFT projects to make it into the spotlight.
1243200	1244200	Crypto kitties.
1244200	1245200	Crypto kitties.
1245200	1250200	The viral blockchain-based game that sparked a global craze for virtual cats.
1250200	1251200	It's a picture of a cat.
1251200	1255200	You logged onto the site, you created an account that was connected to your crypto wallet,
1255200	1260200	and you'd play this game in which you would collect, breed and sell virtual cats for cryptocurrency.
1260200	1267200	The key pitch here though is that every cat is its own unique token that exists on the Ethereum blockchain,
1267200	1270200	making them what you would essentially call a non-fungible,
1270200	1274200	or as they're often called now, a non-fungible token, an NFT.
1274200	1277200	Think of it like a digital beanie babies.
1277200	1281200	Now if that sounds a little weird, it's because it is.
1281200	1283200	Crypto kitties became like its own mania.
1283200	1287200	It generated $3 million within its first week of launch
1287200	1292200	and accounted for roughly 10 to 13% of all traffic on Ethereum's network.
1292200	1295200	And where was everyone's focus during that mania?
1295200	1299200	Okay, that's $2,700 for this little guy.
1299200	1300200	Why use these crypto kitties?
1300200	1303200	$450,000 for this ugly mug.
1303200	1305200	The same reason you started out with the cryptocurrency.
1305200	1306200	To make money.
1306200	1308200	Guys, this is a potential way to make some money.
1308200	1309200	This is insane.
1309200	1311200	Most users are trying to breed their cats at the moment,
1311200	1315200	not just because it's kind of cool, but also because they can be very expensive.
1315200	1319200	There are thousands of people playing on the Crypto Kitties website.
1319200	1321200	Once everyone started rushing to join in on the hype,
1321200	1323200	the economics of the game began to falter
1323200	1327200	as the supply of crypto kitties stretched far beyond the demand,
1327200	1330200	eventually leading to a crash in the price of crypto kitties
1330200	1332200	and a fall in average users.
1332200	1336200	Because as you continue to see time and time again,
1336200	1339200	almost everyone was there to make money.
1339200	1343200	But what remained of that saga was the idea of non-fungible assets.
1343200	1345200	A brand new package, a brand new pitch,
1345200	1350200	a new route to find use cases for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.
1350200	1356200	This stuff was initially pitched to digital artists.
1356200	1358200	The idea was that you would make artwork,
1358200	1360200	then tokenize that artwork,
1360200	1364200	which just means turning it into a token that exists on a blockchain like Ethereum.
1364200	1366200	If you wanted to know who owned the artwork,
1366200	1370200	all you had to do was just go and check the blockchain records
1370200	1373200	and see which wallet was associated with the artwork.
1373200	1377200	In theory, you could digitally verify the ownership of your art.
1377200	1378200	Sounds exciting.
1378200	1379200	You might think.
1379200	1380200	I did too.
1381200	1384200	Digital artist Michael Winkleman, otherwise known as Beeple,
1384200	1388200	began a challenge in 2007 where he would create one piece of artwork
1388200	1391200	every single day and continue to do so throughout the years.
1391200	1394200	It was known as his every day's collection.
1394200	1398200	But to me, the bigger project is this long-term every day's project,
1398200	1401200	which is a project that I've been working on, you know,
1401200	1403200	every single day for over 12 years.
1403200	1406200	It was reportedly around October of 2020
1406200	1410200	when Beeple was put in touch with an anonymous NFT artist called Pak
1410200	1414200	and Pak informed Beeple about the world of NFTs.
1414200	1415200	Only a few months later,
1415200	1417200	he would end up auctioning a piece of artwork
1417200	1422200	that contained a collage of the first 5,000 images of the Every Day series,
1422200	1425200	titled Every Day's The First 5,000 Days.
1425200	1430200	$69.3 million was how much it sold for in the Ether cryptocurrency,
1430200	1433200	one of the largest sales in digital art history.
1433200	1437200	The very sale that sent the search term NFT skyrocketing.
1437200	1439200	So now the question becomes,
1439200	1442200	who decided to make that purchase?
1442200	1447200	So you purchased a collection of 5,000 pieces of digital art
1447200	1451200	that anyone can easily see online for $69 million.
1451200	1453200	Why did you do that?
1453200	1458200	MetaCoven, or as they were later revealed to be Vignesh Sundaresan,
1458200	1461200	a crypto entrepreneur who had recently co-founded
1461200	1465200	a crypto investment firm with his business partner called Metapurse.
1465200	1469200	Only a few months before this big $69 million purchase,
1469200	1471200	MetaCoven and his business partner
1471200	1474200	had already bought another collection of NFTs from Beeple
1474200	1476200	for over $2.2 million.
1476200	1479200	They actually wrote a blog post about their purchase,
1479200	1482200	alluding to the fact that this was only part of a much bigger project
1482200	1484200	that they had in mind that will quote,
1484200	1487200	flip the art world status quo on its head.
1487200	1489200	And what was that project that they were talking about?
1490200	1492200	The B20 token coin.
1492200	1496200	They were going to bundle their purchases of Beeple's NFT's collection
1496200	1500200	and put it in a virtual museum where those who purchased the B20 token coin
1500200	1503200	could access and view the artwork.
1503200	1507200	Owning the B20 token was supposed to represent a type of fractional ownership
1507200	1510200	in the virtual museum and the contents inside of it.
1510200	1511200	Here's the thing,
1511200	1514200	MetaCoven and his business partner conveniently owned
1514200	1518200	59% of the total supply of B20 tokens.
1518200	1522200	Beeple was also given 2% of that supply.
1522200	1526200	Beeple and MetaCoven already had a working relationship
1526200	1529200	before the big every day's 5,000 sale.
1529200	1532200	When that sale happened and the media frenzy ensued,
1532200	1536200	the B20 token rose in value to $23
1536200	1539200	as more people began obviously looking into who MetaCoven was.
1539200	1542200	People have accused that sale of essentially being
1542200	1546200	a giant marketing stunt to increase the value of the B20 token.
1546200	1548200	Even in their calls together,
1548200	1551200	you can hear Beeple express skepticism around the whole thing
1551200	1554200	only for MetaCoven and the others to kind of bring him around.
1554200	1558200	Other artists I can almost guarantee will not like this.
1558200	1560200	Like they will not like you taking their work
1560200	1562200	and like splitting it into a million pieces
1562200	1564200	and reselling those pieces.
1564200	1568200	That I would be very surprised if other artists
1568200	1572200	did not have a very strong dislike of that.
1572200	1575200	But what I find the most insane about this saga
1575200	1578200	was that the B20 virtual museum
1578200	1581200	that was supposed to flip the art world status quo
1581200	1583200	was nothing impressive.
1583200	1587200	The B20 token has fallen over 99% in value
1587200	1589200	since its all time high.
1589200	1592200	Despite all of this, MetaCoven's sales
1592200	1594200	sent headlines skyrocketing.
1594200	1597200	Suddenly NFTs were being created out of internet memes
1597200	1600200	or anything really that was culturally relevant to the internet.
1600200	1602200	From the outside, all you had to know
1602200	1604200	were that NFTs were revolutionary
1604200	1606200	and there was a lot of money involved.
1606200	1608200	You didn't even have to know that they were intrinsically tied
1608200	1611200	to the world of cryptocurrencies or blockchain.
1611200	1613200	A successful repackaging.
1613200	1617200	Once the sale of memes and other one-off NFT sales cooled down,
1617200	1621200	it became more popular to start buying into NFT projects.
1621200	1624200	These contained up to thousands of NFTs inside of them,
1624200	1627200	usually following a certain theme or concept.
1627200	1629200	What are crypto punks?
1629200	1631200	These are the crypto punks.
1631200	1633200	They are 25 by 25 pixels.
1633200	1635200	They're icons of zombies.
1635200	1638200	There's aliens, zombies, and they all have different mohawks
1638200	1641200	and glasses and beard types.
1641200	1645200	What is Cool Cat? The coolest NFTs on the blockchain?
1645200	1647200	Shoot, I got a lazy lion's NFT
1647200	1650200	thinking about joining this amazing community.
1650200	1653200	Clone X. This project is previously known as Akira.
1653200	1655200	Sneaky Vampire Syndicate.
1655200	1657200	They've got Pudgy Penguins on the chopping block today.
1658200	1661200	Just as it had been with Bitcoin and Token Coins,
1661200	1664200	the name of the game was about hyping up projects
1664200	1666200	that you can sell it for profit later.
1666200	1669200	NFTs, though, were cooler than your average Token Coins,
1669200	1671200	so they had art behind them.
1671200	1674200	You could show them off by replacing your social media profile picture
1674200	1676200	with an NFT you purchased.
1676200	1680200	More so than ever, hype and attention became an important part
1680200	1683200	of growing the value of an NFT,
1683200	1685200	which brings us to the apes.
1686200	1689200	One of the most significant projects created after Beeple's sale
1689200	1691200	was the Board Ape Yacht Club,
1691200	1693200	otherwise shortened to just Basie.
1693200	1695200	Founded by the company Yuga Labs,
1695200	1698200	the project featured 10,000 different pictures of apes
1698200	1701200	with this distinct board expression on their face.
1701200	1704200	The Board Ape Yacht Club project had managed to arrive
1704200	1706200	into the NFT space at just the right time,
1706200	1708200	about a month after Beeple's big sale.
1708200	1711200	There were a few popular people inside of the NFT space,
1711200	1714200	already one of which went by the name of Jimmy McNeil
1714200	1717200	otherwise known as JimmyEath on Twitter,
1717200	1720200	who shortly after finding out about the project,
1720200	1723200	announces their purchase of hundreds of Board Ape NFTs.
1723200	1726200	Then another popular figure in the NFT space, Pranksy,
1726200	1729200	who had around 50,000 followers at the time,
1729200	1732200	tweets their own purchase of 250 Board Apes,
1732200	1734200	which later grows to 1,250.
1734200	1737200	And all the time these guys are tweeting about their purchases
1737200	1741200	to their followers, it starts to create this buzz inside of the crypto space.
1741200	1746200	You've probably seen all over Twitter this crazy, crazy thing with apes.
1746200	1749200	Just after 12 hours of its official launch,
1749200	1751200	the Basie Collection sold out,
1751200	1755200	giving Yuga Labs an estimated $2.8 million in revenue.
1755200	1759200	Pranksy starts selling some of his apes to NBA players
1759200	1762200	who start tweeting and changing their profile pictures to those apes.
1762200	1765200	In August, the popular DJ, Steve Aoki,
1765200	1768200	tweets his own $40,000 purchase of a Board Ape
1768200	1770200	to his millions of followers.
1770200	1773200	Tag Ape, follow Ape, began trending immediately.
1773200	1775200	Famous digital artist Meeple tweeting about it
1775200	1777200	and creating an artwork about it,
1777200	1780200	which continued to drive up the price of Board Apes.
1780200	1783200	You ape, me ape, a friend.
1784200	1787200	One of the shadiest parts about everything that followed
1787200	1791200	were the blurred lines between celebrities and influencers
1791200	1794200	clearly manipulating a market to pump up the value of their NFTs
1794200	1797200	and genuine posts simply just showing off their purchases.
1797200	1799200	You had Justin Bieber in January of this year
1799200	1802200	posting a picture of a Board Ape number 3001
1802200	1805200	to his 251 million followers,
1805200	1809200	a purchase that was reportedly worth $1.3 million.
1809200	1811200	Everyone sort of assumes that Justin
1811200	1813200	was the one that made the purchase himself, right?
1813200	1815200	And he's just posting it on his Instagram.
1815200	1818200	But then Twitter users started to look into the records
1818200	1821200	and they find that Justin's supposed crypto wallet
1821200	1824200	had received 900 ether from another wallet address.
1824200	1826200	And that wallet address was associated
1826200	1829200	with an individual named Jean Piero di Alessandro
1829200	1831200	or, as many others may recognize him,
1831200	1833200	Justin Bieber's business partner.
1833200	1837200	And Jean Piero owned his own NFT collection called Inbetweeners
1837200	1840200	which Bieber had been promoting on social media already.
1840200	1843200	In those posts, no disclaimer was made suggesting
1843200	1845200	that Bieber had been paid to promote them.
1845200	1847200	I just got my first NFT.
1847200	1848200	You did? What was it?
1848200	1849200	I threw MoonPay.
1849200	1853200	In some of the announcements from celebrities about their NFT purchases
1853200	1856200	there was this constant reference to a company called MoonPay,
1856200	1859200	thanking them for help with purchasing their NFTs.
1859200	1862200	I got an Ape too because I saw you on the show with people
1862200	1863200	and you said you got a MoonPay.
1863200	1867200	Turns out MoonPay was a company that was launched in 2019
1867200	1870200	which according to their website had one singular aim,
1870200	1873200	to increase cryptocurrency adoption.
1873200	1874200	So that begs the question,
1874200	1877200	what is the relationship between MoonPay
1877200	1880200	and the supposed celebrities and influences
1880200	1882200	they're helping by NFTs?
1882200	1885200	We'll talk, not once, not twice.
1885200	1890200	So we targets have an offer to support a true MoonPay.
1890200	1893200	At the end of the NDAs they try to send my each agency to, you know,
1893200	1897200	they want you to not disclose that they had purchased the NFT.
1897200	1900200	Isn't it a little shady that you have the CEO of MoonPay,
1900200	1902200	a guy called Ivan Soto Wright,
1902200	1905200	who is an active participant in the NFT market,
1905200	1907200	who is clearly well connected to the celebrities
1907200	1909200	using his company's service,
1909200	1911200	who has access to insider information
1911200	1914200	and likely knows when celebrities may purchase an NFT
1914200	1915200	before they do it.
1915200	1918200	And surprise, surprise, people started finding out
1918200	1921200	that Wright on numerous occasions has purchased NFT projects
1921200	1924200	right before celebrities end up purchasing them.
1926200	1929200	Prominent cryptoskeptic and author David Gerrard
1929200	1931200	had this post on his blog.
1931200	1935200	It was titled CryptoGrifters Try to Scam Artists Again.
1935200	1936200	He wrote,
1939200	1941200	Tell artists there's a gusher of free money.
1941200	1942200	NFTs are the future.
1942200	1944200	If you want to get an NFTs,
1944200	1947200	you're guaranteed to make some money because it's new, it's fresh.
1947200	1951200	Two, they need to buy into crypto to get the gusher of free money.
1951200	1953200	Three, they become crypto advocates
1953200	1956200	and make excuses for proof of work and so on.
1956200	1960200	Four, a few artists really are making life-changing money from this.
1960200	1962200	Five, you probably won't be one of them.
1962200	1965200	It's sold to you as this amazing thing
1965200	1968200	where art is digitally verified on the blockchain.
1968200	1971200	And that pitch makes you think that on the blockchain,
1971200	1972200	when you purchase an NFT,
1972200	1975200	there's literally an entry that shows your wallet
1975200	1978200	and the actual image of the NFT you purchased right there.
1978200	1981200	You want to know what is actually the case with most NFTs?
1981200	1984200	There is no picture attached to the transaction.
1984200	1988200	Instead, it's usually a HTTPS or IPFS link
1988200	1990200	containing the stored NFT image.
1990200	1993200	So what you're purchasing with most NFTs
1993200	1996200	is just an entry in a database that contains a link to the image
1996200	1999200	that anyone else can also access.
1999200	2001200	A little misleading to call that ownership.
2001200	2003200	But I guess at the end of the day,
2003200	2006200	that doesn't matter when, just like ICOs,
2006200	2009200	NFTs were just another speculative financial investment
2009200	2010200	to throw your money into.
2010200	2014200	And to do that, you had to buy into cryptocurrencies.
2014200	2018200	More money funneled into the machine.
2018200	2021200	In my experience of looking into crypto communities
2021200	2023200	and its culture and various projects,
2023200	2025200	there is this game that is being played.
2025200	2028200	Some are blatant about it and others less so.
2028200	2029200	But the game is this.
2029200	2032200	Everyone is playing a role in promoting their project,
2032200	2035200	calling it revolutionary, saying that this isn't like the others,
2035200	2038200	but ultimately, everyone knows that at some point,
2038200	2040200	they're going to sell.
2040200	2042200	And perhaps it is because of the greater full nature
2042200	2044200	of the crypto ecosystem,
2044200	2047200	where everyone is incentivized to keep putting money into the system
2047200	2051200	and to keep pushing it while simultaneously dismissing criticism.
2051200	2054200	On the surface, everything is supposed to be positive
2054200	2055200	and optimistic.
2055200	2058200	You have catchphrases and actions that are commonly used
2058200	2060200	in cryptocurrency communities.
2060200	2062200	HODL, short for hold on for dear life,
2062200	2065200	which refers to holding onto your crypto assets no matter what.
2065200	2067200	HODLing is seen as a good thing.
2067200	2070200	Today, we're going to be talking about the art of the hole.
2070200	2072200	HODL again, HODL again, HODL again.
2072200	2074200	Wagameet, short for we're all going to make it,
2074200	2076200	which is used as both a greeting
2076200	2078200	and an easy catchphrase to keep morale high.
2078200	2080200	We're all going to make it, and I say this,
2080200	2082200	with passion and confidence.
2082200	2086200	If you leave the market, if you give up, you will lose.
2086200	2087200	That is the ultimate failure.
2087200	2091200	We're still early is a sentiment often echoed in crypto communities
2091200	2094200	and encouraging message for those who are both new and old in the space,
2094200	2097200	letting them know that they haven't missed out on the opportunity
2097200	2099200	and further riches are on the horizon.
2099200	2101200	Don't abandon hope.
2101200	2103200	Is it too late to get into crypto?
2103200	2104200	No, never.
2104200	2105200	It's never too late.
2105200	2106200	It's actually too early.
2106200	2107200	It's extremely early still.
2107200	2109200	Those who hold onto their crypto assets,
2109200	2111200	even when there is really good reason to sell,
2111200	2113200	are called diamond hands.
2113200	2115200	Diamond hands is actually a requirement.
2115200	2116200	Keep diamond handing, OK?
2116200	2118200	A positive trait that is encouraged,
2118200	2121200	whereas those who do sell are labeled paper hands.
2121200	2124200	A negative trait which is actively discouraged.
2124200	2127200	The worst part about paper-handed investors
2127200	2133200	is that it influences other people to grow paper on their hands.
2133200	2136200	Most crypto communities are encouraged to say good morning
2136200	2138200	and good night to each other every day,
2138200	2140200	and listen to just a GM and GN,
2140200	2143200	kind of like a regular check-in and check-out with members.
2143200	2145200	Negativity is usually handled in the same way,
2145200	2149200	since one group's negativity can actually devalue a project
2149200	2151200	and affect everyone else's ability to make money.
2151200	2155200	If there's some bad news about a particular cryptocurrency project
2155200	2157200	or cryptocurrencies in general,
2157200	2159200	it can be dismissed as fud,
2159200	2162200	an abbreviation for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
2162200	2166200	We have someone that, again, is trying to spread fud.
2166200	2170200	They just couldn't sit idly by and let people fud my investment
2170200	2173200	and fud the leader of my investment.
2173200	2175200	Or those who criticize are told,
2175200	2178200	you simply don't understand without any further elaboration.
2178200	2181200	Or they're told to have fun staying poor,
2181200	2185200	which is a not-so-subtle nod to people's true intentions within the space.
2185200	2189200	Or criticism is actually spun into a good thing for the project.
2189200	2192200	These are all very convenient actions to encourage
2192200	2195200	when keeping someone engaged and hopeful in a crypto project
2195200	2198200	is financially beneficial to everyone else.
2199200	2203200	I'm actually struck by how much the general public really hates it
2203200	2209200	when someone gets into NFTs and they just have an absolute adverse reaction.
2209200	2211200	I see this across industries.
2211200	2213200	The NFT mania did something.
2213200	2218200	I think it grew so big and so in-your-face from influencers and celebrities
2218200	2221200	that it started making people mad.
2221200	2223200	I'm so proud. I'm loving part of this community
2223200	2226200	and being a voice and sharing my platform and just getting the word out there.
2226200	2228200	What community? What are you guys talking about?
2228200	2230200	You don't fucking care about this.
2230200	2232200	I hate that they try to put on that they care about this.
2232200	2239200	Board a yacht club NFTs, which I think are ugly, dumb, cringe.
2239200	2243200	Thank you guys for allowing me to scream about NFT cartoons.
2243200	2245200	I hate this stuff. It's getting worse.
2245200	2247200	Check this out. I got a board bunny.
2247200	2250200	And not only is it a board bunny, but it looks like me. Look at that.
2250200	2253200	Nothing makes people hate you faster than NFT shilling.
2253200	2258200	If you're young and naive, just like my brother and want to get into NFTs,
2258200	2259200	you should check out Board Bunny.
2259200	2264200	The new Board Bunny NFT project has now been classified as a scam.
2264200	2267200	I welcome David Doberk to the long list of influencers promoting scams.
2267200	2270200	Further claiming the team has disappeared with $6 million.
2270200	2274200	It's great to be a part of this project. I love the designs inspired by Pokemon.
2274200	2278200	It's a Pokemon knockoff. It's just like stealing money from people who are fans of Pokemon.
2278200	2279200	Y'all better not miss this.
2279200	2283200	They promised Pokemon partnerships and it was all a lie
2283200	2286200	and it ended up raking in $6.3 million.
2286200	2290200	For the last six months, I've been working on my own NFT project.
2290200	2292200	The project is called CryptoZoo.
2292200	2293200	I believe it's going to change the game.
2293200	2296200	CryptoZoo, Logan Paul's newest project,
2296200	2300200	are basically a bunch of stock photos from Adobe that have been poorly photoshopped.
2300200	2305200	Unfungible tokens. Yes, I do know what they are, but I don't really like them at all really.
2305200	2306200	I'm not really into them.
2306200	2308200	Nobody seems to like NFTs.
2308200	2312200	We didn't find anybody who actually had anything positive to say about them.
2312200	2316200	Whenever a big celebrity or influencer would post something related to NFTs on their social media,
2316200	2319200	you'd see a whole slew of people responding with,
2319200	2321200	oh no, not you too.
2321200	2323200	And this wasn't just limited to individuals either.
2323200	2327200	Companies began getting a lot of flak for even talking about or dabbling into NFTs.
2327200	2332200	In 2021, people found out what cryptocurrency actually was and they hated.
2332200	2337200	It is all get rich quick schemes promoted using technology as the cover.
2337200	2338200	All of it.
2338200	2339200	That's what crypto is.
2339200	2341200	And NFT is the latest species.
2341200	2345200	I think in June of 1500, computer scientists and technologists directed Congress
2345200	2349200	calling for more responsible regulation of crypto assets.
2349200	2353200	They said the catastrophes and externalities related to blockchain technologies
2353200	2357200	and crypto asset investments are the inevitable outcomes of a technology
2357200	2360200	that is not built for purpose and will remain forever unsuitable
2360200	2363200	as a foundation for large scale economic activity.
2363200	2366200	And so you start to wonder, okay, what's going to happen?
2366200	2369200	And I know that it really shouldn't surprise me,
2369200	2374200	but a whole new packaging had been in the works and a brand new word was taking the stage.
2376200	2381200	Our mission at MoonPay is to onboard the world to Web 3.
2381200	2384200	I have to admit, it's a pretty convincing narrative.
2384200	2387200	The first iteration of the Internet, Web 1.0,
2387200	2392200	was essentially the first version of the web mostly consisting of web pages and information.
2392200	2394200	There wasn't much you could actually interact with.
2394200	2399200	Then came along Web 2.0, which brought access to many new features.
2399200	2404200	It focused on user generated content, social media and more forms of participation.
2404200	2408200	This version of the Internet became dominated by large corporations.
2408200	2412200	Web 2.0 is our current modern day version of the Internet.
2412200	2415200	But now Web 3.0 is coming.
2415200	2418200	It kind of just referred to a bunch of different things,
2418200	2421200	but the idea was that a new version of the Internet is here,
2421200	2427200	where your online activity was going to be making use of blockchains and tokens to some degree or another.
2427200	2431200	So in theory, the now centralized version of the Internet owned by Big Tech
2431200	2434200	would become owned now by its users.
2434200	2439200	In its initial bubble, NFTs were seen as just digital art, right, which is quite limiting.
2439200	2443200	At the end of the day, NFTs are just data on a public database
2443200	2446200	that can act as a receipt of ownership over whatever that data contained.
2446200	2450200	You know, whether it was a coin or it was a web link to a digital piece of art.
2450200	2455200	The idea was that if NFTs could prove ownership over something,
2455200	2457200	then you could put anything on the blockchain.
2457200	2461200	Real estate titles, medical records, university degrees, legal records.
2461200	2465200	In the case of Web 3.0, you'd have social media sites and video games,
2465200	2468200	all incorporating blockchain and NFTs into their business model.
2468200	2471200	It didn't really matter what it was or how it would work exactly.
2471200	2476200	It just became this game of insert anything here, but on the blockchain.
2476200	2478200	And just like that, you've made it revolutionary.
2478200	2482200	You've just recreated the entire mortgage infrastructure that already exists today.
2482200	2483200	On the blockchain.
2483200	2484200	Exactly.
2484200	2488200	The blockchain in real estate is going to be pretty mainstream five to ten years from now.
2488200	2491200	These solar grids, electric grids, self-driving car grids,
2491200	2495200	that will essentially be machine run and controlled and administered by blockchains.
2495200	2498200	The best use case for blockchain is healthcare.
2498200	2500200	What can and can't be turned into an NFT?
2500200	2503200	Ultimately, what we're talking about is the tokenization of everything.
2503200	2508200	Never mind if blockchains or tokenization actually fixed the issues
2508200	2510200	that it was claiming to solve in these industries.
2510200	2514200	It was literally the definition of a solution in search of a problem.
2514200	2518200	I'm lost as to why the on the blockchain part matters,
2518200	2520200	besides basically what everyone means is they mean,
2520200	2524200	oh, I want a public record of the transaction.
2524200	2525200	Okay.
2525200	2530200	I mean, people suggested that you could replace legal contracts with smart contracts,
2530200	2532200	which are programs that are built on the blockchain.
2532200	2534200	And that's usually accompanied with the phrase code is law.
2534200	2536200	This is a smart contract.
2536200	2538200	And this is a legal contract.
2538200	2540200	These two things aren't the same, right?
2540200	2543200	You can't have law be enacted by a computer code
2543200	2547200	because law inherently requires third parties to assess evidence, intentions,
2547200	2551200	and a bunch of other variables that you just can't outsource that to computer code,
2551200	2554200	especially when that code is on the blockchain and it cannot be altered.
2554200	2559200	Nicholas Weaver, a researcher and lecturer at UC Berkeley's Department for Computer Science,
2559200	2561200	has this interview with Current Affairs,
2561200	2564200	and he brought up what he called Weaver's Iron Law of blockchain.
2564200	2567200	When somebody says you can solve X with blockchain,
2567200	2570200	they don't understand X and you can just ignore them.
2570200	2571200	So you start to wonder, right?
2571200	2576200	Who is behind all of this money that's coming and pouring into the crypto and Web 3 space?
2576200	2578200	Where is it coming from and why?
2578200	2582200	Either I'm not seeing the revolutionary potential that all of this has,
2582200	2588200	or this genuinely is a massive mania and bubble that is being fueled by greed and delusion.
2588200	2593200	The so-called next version of the internet that's attracting big money from venture capital.
2593200	2597200	Venture firm called Andreessen Horowitz, have you guys heard of it?
2597200	2600200	I kept seeing this venture capital name pop up.
2600200	2602200	We've been in the space for a long time.
2602200	2606200	Kind of a big deal, running the crypto fund with more than 7 billion in capital to deploy.
2606200	2610200	Andreessen Horowitz, otherwise known as A16Z,
2610200	2613200	they're one of the largest venture capital firms.
2613200	2619200	They have a crypto fund with around 7.6 billion to be invested in crypto and Web 3 startups,
2619200	2623200	and have been investing in crypto companies dating back to 2013.
2623200	2626200	If you wanted to meet the smart money behind all of this,
2626200	2628200	then these guys were the best place to start.
2628200	2632200	They say that crypto is far more than just a financial innovation.
2632200	2635200	It's social, cultural, technological.
2635200	2641200	In the month of October of 2021, A16Z led a funding of $115 million
2641200	2644200	towards the company that was behind Axie Infinity.
2644200	2647200	A16Z general partner, Ariana Simpson,
2647200	2652200	claimed that this was an example of where Web 3 is going to revolutionize the internet.
2652200	2654200	In her own words, literally,
2654200	2656200	Axie embodies a new generation of games,
2656200	2658200	what this means for the future of games,
2658200	2663200	and really the web as we know it is as big as your imagination will allow.
2663200	2665200	Where do I begin?
2665200	2668200	Axie Infinity was what you would call a play to earn game.
2668200	2671200	It was this new genre of games appearing in the Web 3 space,
2671200	2675200	which, as the name suggests, allows players to make money when they play the game.
2675200	2679200	In the case of Axie Infinity, what you had was this game where people would breed,
2679200	2682200	collect, and fight with these creatures called Axies.
2682200	2686200	When battling inside the game, it was possible to earn this token called SLP,
2686200	2688200	which could actually be traded for real money.
2688200	2690200	So what started happening?
2690200	2692200	Well, people started playing the game,
2692200	2695200	but instead of focusing on the fun of the game,
2695200	2698200	the focus became on how to earn more SLP.
2698200	2700200	How do you profit from Axie Infinity?
2700200	2704200	The most expensive Axie ever sold was worth about $800,000.
2704200	2708200	I've invested $13,232.
2709200	2714200	To even play Axie Infinity, you had to purchase three Axie NFTs, right?
2714200	2716200	And as the value of Axie NFTs started to rise,
2716200	2719200	certain players wouldn't be able to afford the buy-in price.
2719200	2721200	So guess what started happening?
2721200	2724200	Those who had the money to buy three Axies
2724200	2727200	began to lend their creatures out to players who couldn't afford it.
2727200	2729200	They were called Scholars.
2729200	2733200	How to set up your own scholarship program as a manager in Axie Infinity?
2733200	2735200	I'll be giving out a scholarship every two weeks,
2735200	2737200	so that's another six scholarships is my goal.
2737200	2741200	Scholars would then play the game using their rented Axies,
2741200	2745200	earn SLP, and then give a cut of their earnings to their managers.
2745200	2750200	My team of 12 scholars was roughly earning me $1,700 a month.
2750200	2752200	$600 from my scholars.
2752200	2754200	With all of my current scholarships working,
2754200	2757200	I'm earning about $6,000 a month.
2757200	2761200	Axie Infinity, a play to earn crypto gaming juggernaut
2761200	2765200	that has led people in countries like Philippines and Venezuela to make a living.
2765200	2769200	These are players from the Philippines who are making a living playing Axie Infinity.
2769200	2771200	Most of the scholars who couldn't afford the buy-in price,
2771200	2773200	they were from developing countries, right?
2773200	2776200	People who likely saw Axie Infinity not as a game of leisure,
2776200	2778200	but as a means of producing income.
2778200	2782200	I am here to apply scholarship on Axie Infinity.
2782200	2786200	I want this scholarship because I want to earn more.
2786200	2790200	I can play six to twelve hours a day just for playing Axie Infinity.
2790200	2793200	I will treat this as a job, not just only a game.
2793200	2799200	I want to help my family under expenses and save up money for my tuition and college.
2799200	2805200	So I want to be a scholar so that I can meet the needs of my family.
2805200	2810200	What you ended up with was a game where players are playing in order to make money.
2810200	2814200	People are basically feeding their entire villagers playing our games.
2814200	2819200	But the only reason that they're making money is because others are buying in to also make money.
2819200	2823200	In the case of things like Axie Infinity, there actually are a bunch of innocent victims, right?
2823200	2827200	When you run a pyramid scheme, unfortunately you get a bunch of poor people in the Philippines
2827200	2831200	who are poor when they start and they're just hoping to make some money,
2831200	2833200	but then what happens is they actually lose money.
2833200	2837200	The value of SLP, which is the token that people use to actually make money in the game,
2837200	2842200	has fallen 99% since its peak and its user base has been in decline since.
2842200	2847200	Times Magazine came out with this article and it was interviewing this guy called Samerson Orias,
2847200	2851200	a line cook from the Philippines who was facing financial stress after his mother had a stroke
2851200	2854200	and electricity and grocery bills were stacking up.
2854200	2858200	Orias jumped into the Axie Infinity game and then exited 14 months later.
2858200	2861200	He described it as boring and stressful.
2861200	2865200	Orias, along with other players of the game, told Times Magazine that Axie Infinity
2865200	2868200	reinforced predatory systems and gave them false hope.
2868200	2873200	It's already dystopian as hell, but then to say to people that by doing this
2873200	2878200	we are creating opportunity for people in the developing world.
2878200	2882200	That's not just dark, that's fucking evil.
2882200	2885200	Again, I find myself coming back to the same question.
2885200	2890200	What is it that VC firms are seeing the potential in in this crypto space?
2890200	2893200	Why do they keep pouring money into it?
2893200	2896200	The overwhelming majority of tokens are securities.
2896200	2899200	But they're being dumped onto retail investors.
2899200	2902200	This is being done explicitly by venture firms, I won't mention any names,
2902200	2906200	who are buying into companies early, getting into tokens,
2906200	2909200	and then those tokens are being listed on exchanges.
2909200	2913200	The public is buying into them in order to get a financial gain.
2913200	2916200	They have no interest in using those tokens for any utility.
2916200	2919200	VC firms have a commonly used strategy.
2919200	2923200	They invest in a bunch of startups, most of those startups will fail,
2923200	2925200	a few will succeed, and with the ones that succeed,
2925200	2928200	a VC needs to decide on an exit strategy,
2928200	2931200	an event that allows them to liquidate their position in a company
2931200	2933200	and essentially make money.
2933200	2935200	This is a process that can take years.
2935200	2939200	So there's another idea that is proposed by skeptics,
2939200	2944200	that the world of crypto offers an incentive for VC firms to invest in a crypto company,
2944200	2946200	receive a percentage of their tokens,
2946200	2950200	and then sell those tokens to retail traders when it becomes publicly available.
2950200	2955200	All achievable within months, highly profitable, and fairly unregulated.
2955200	2958200	With crypto tokens, they can cash out in a few months,
2958200	2963200	and the way that this actually works is they encourage their fundees
2963200	2966200	to basically issue unregistered securities.
2966200	2970200	Anderson Horowitz invested in a bunch of startups
2970200	2974200	that all issued tokens, that all got dumped on retail,
2974200	2978200	including Anderson Horowitz dumping a lot of them on retail.
2978200	2981200	This is blatant securities fraud,
2981200	2984200	but they didn't commit the securities fraud.
2984200	2987200	It was just the companies they invested in.
2987200	2989200	On the surface, Web 3 has this narrative,
2989200	2993200	which is all about taking money out of the hands of the rich and the big tech
2993200	2995200	and giving it back to the users.
2995200	2998200	But A16Z is the exact same company that has funded
2998200	3002200	some of the biggest Web 2 companies like Facebook and Twitter.
3002200	3004200	I'm sure that there are many inside of these firms
3004200	3007200	that really believe in the potential of Web 3
3007200	3011200	or crypto or blockchains or whatever buzzword you want to use,
3011200	3015200	but it becomes increasingly harder to see that as anything other than hyperoptimism
3015200	3018200	or another word for it, delusion.
3018200	3021200	There's this interview with Mark Andreessen, right,
3021200	3023200	who's the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz,
3023200	3027200	and he's on this podcast episode with an economist and blogger called Tyler Cohen,
3027200	3031200	and he proposes the idea for podcasts to make use of Web 3.
3031200	3032200	A well-known podcast host.
3032200	3036200	How does that person get paid in a better way through Web 3.0?
3036200	3038200	Make that more concrete for us.
3038200	3041200	Now, Mark Andreessen is someone that, by all accounts,
3041200	3044200	should have a good answer to this question.
3044200	3045200	But instead...
3045200	3047200	Yeah, I mean, they can pick their business model.
3047200	3049200	I mean, they can pick their business model.
3049200	3052200	They can decide, you know, the business model, you know, microtransactions.
3052200	3055200	They can pick, you know, they can pick whatever model they want.
3055200	3058200	You know, they can also have indirect, you know, there's this whole new rise
3058200	3060200	of this kind of the non-fungible token.
3060200	3062200	You know, when pressed to give an actual use case,
3062200	3066200	what you get is an answer with all the right buzzwords and phrases,
3066200	3068200	but little actual substance.
3068200	3069200	I compare it to the Internet.
3069200	3072200	Like, in all seriousness, I compare it to the Internet, which is the Internet, basically.
3072200	3073200	It's 93 or so.
3073200	3074200	Yeah, it's like 93, 94.
3074200	3078200	This is the only time I've ever said this is like the Internet is this.
3078200	3083200	A16Z uses the same narrative that a lot of crypto enthusiasts will also use.
3083200	3085200	You may hate it, you may think it's a fad,
3085200	3088200	but crypto and Web 3.0 are just like the Internet.
3088200	3092200	Even I made this comparison when I looked at the entire space in a more favorable light.
3092200	3096200	Now, though, I just think it's another form of smoke and mirrors.
3096200	3100200	It is the biggest technology shift since the Internet, the blockchain,
3100200	3103200	the consumer blockchains, the biggest new thing since the Internet itself.
3103200	3106200	Bitcoin began in 2009.
3106200	3110200	Arguably blockchain technology and the foundations for it began even earlier than that.
3110200	3114200	It's been 13 years since this story began with Bitcoin.
3114200	3119200	13 years to find a solid use case, or at least one that justifies the hype
3119200	3122200	and is already better than an existing system.
3122200	3127200	Crypto and Web 3 is really great at one thing, which is trading in speculation.
3127200	3130200	And there is absolutely no democratization of anything.
3130200	3134200	There's centralization of exchanges, centralization of miners,
3134200	3139200	centralization of crypto wealth is the most concentrated amount of centralized wealth
3139200	3141200	in the history of humanity.
3142200	3149200	13 years after 1983, which is considered to be the birth of the Internet,
3149200	3152200	we were already seeing very clear card use cases.
3152200	3155200	Even in those early days, people could get weather reports,
3155200	3158200	they could check the news, they could send emails and many other uses
3158200	3160200	that we still use to this day.
3160200	3163200	I sent a message to my doctor asking for a repeat prescription
3163200	3168200	and he's left the prescription for me in the chemist.
3168200	3172200	By even making the comparison to one of the biggest revolutions in information
3172200	3176200	and communication is already assuming that cryptocurrencies are revolutionary
3176200	3179200	and they're bound to find mass adoption at some point,
3179200	3182200	when that is the very future we're putting into question.
3184200	3188200	One recent post that I remember on the Bitcoin subreddit was titled
3188200	3192200	Does anyone else feel like Bitcoin is their literal last-ditch effort
3192200	3194200	to become wealthy in their lifetime?
3194200	3198200	I don't imagine that this is the only person in the crypto space that is thinking that way.
3198200	3201200	The crypto machine has continued running.
3201200	3205200	New packaging of ideas, more money funneled into the system
3205200	3209200	and a constant search to find a use case that justifies the hype
3209200	3211200	and the claims of revolutionary technology.
3211200	3215200	If the critics are right, then what we're looking at is a ticking time bomb.
3215200	3219200	If the critics are right, then this is a scheme that will leave
3219200	3224200	tons of regular individuals left holding their bags wondering how this managed to happen.
3224200	3229200	It already has a scheme that managed to infiltrate the realm of media and entertainment
3229200	3233200	that managed to make use of social media's ability to spread this fear of missing out.
3233200	3237200	They're capitalized on greed and a get-rich-quick mentality.
3237200	3242200	If the critics are right, then I suppose there's only one question that remains.
3242200	3245200	At what point does the ticking time bomb go off?
