00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
What you're looking at, depending on who you ask, is either a revolution for the internet

00:06.600 --> 00:13.000
and countless industries as we know it, or the greatest Ponzi scheme in human history.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.200
The whole thing is a promise that you can get rich for free.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.240
Accused of being all of these things is the world of cryptocurrencies, or the other labels

00:23.240 --> 00:29.800
associated with it, NFTs, blockchains, Web 3.0, from the bizarre onslaught of celebrity

00:29.800 --> 00:43.880
promotions and endorsements, to the eye-watering numbers and headlines, to the grandiose claims

00:43.880 --> 00:52.040
about its potential, I once described the world of cryptocurrencies as a story, and

00:52.040 --> 00:55.000
I did that in hopeful, optimistic tones.

00:55.000 --> 01:21.080
And now, now I don't think it's the story that I initially thought it was.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.800
For me and many others, it began here.

01:24.800 --> 01:30.400
What you're looking at is a piece of artwork by a digital artist called Michael Joseph Winkleman,

01:30.400 --> 01:31.960
otherwise known as Beeple.

01:31.960 --> 01:36.680
On February the 25th of 2021, this artwork was put on auction.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.680
Bidding started at $100.

01:39.680 --> 01:47.400
It eventually sold for $69.3 million, making it one of the biggest sales in digital art

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
history.

01:48.400 --> 01:55.680
What happened afterwards?

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
Where do I begin?

01:56.680 --> 02:02.640
A digital artwork by a relatively unknown American artist, sold for nearly $70 million, that's

02:02.640 --> 02:07.360
more than most Picasso's Monet's or Warhol's, that it doesn't exist in physical form, it

02:07.360 --> 02:09.240
is only available digitally.

02:09.240 --> 02:15.480
It's the first NFT ever sold at auction, non-fungible token, NFTs, or non-fungible token,

02:15.840 --> 02:23.200
It was like suddenly the term NFT was just everywhere.

02:23.200 --> 02:28.120
Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sells a picture of his first ever tweet as an NFT.

02:28.120 --> 02:32.880
Jack Dorsey, auctioning his first tweet as digital art, $2.9 million.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.600
Even popular internet memes were selling as this NFT thing, Nyan Cat, $590,000, Charlie

02:38.600 --> 02:46.880
Bit My Finger, $760,999, Disaster Girl, $500,000, Doge, $4 million, Overly Attached Girlfriend,

02:46.880 --> 02:53.400
$411,000, Bad Luck Brian, $36,000, Scumbag Steve, $57,000.

02:53.400 --> 02:59.040
You had singer-songwriter Grime selling $6 million worth of digital art as NFTs?

02:59.040 --> 03:03.640
People were changing their profile pictures on social media to NFTs they had purchased.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.720
It was like flexing an expensive car or a watch.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.880
And then suddenly all these big celebrities and artists and influences were also replacing

03:11.880 --> 03:16.720
their profile pictures with NFTs and announcing their own purchases of NFTs.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.720
And the apes?

03:17.720 --> 03:22.360
The apes were part of this bigger project of NFTs called Board Ape Yacht Club.

03:22.360 --> 03:27.480
I mean, you had Snoop Dogg, Eminem, DJ Khaled, Lil Baby, Post Malone, Stephen Curry, Gwyneth

03:27.480 --> 03:32.840
Paltrow, to name a few, all of them purchasing these pictures of apes for sometimes hundreds

03:32.840 --> 03:34.160
of thousands of dollars.

03:34.160 --> 03:39.040
And amongst this sea of high ticket sales, you would hear that this is all part of something

03:39.040 --> 03:40.040
revolutionary.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.440
It's the biggest technology that's ever happened in the history of life, outside of things

03:44.440 --> 03:45.440
like fire.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.760
Regardless of how much you knew about NFTs, there was one message that was really clear.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.000
Behind every story, every headline, there was an underlying premise.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.880
Something is happening and there is a lot of money to be made.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.320
Welcome back to the show and congrats on getting married.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
This is a big deal.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.800
The last time you were on the show, I asked you to explain NFTs.

04:07.800 --> 04:12.360
So popular talk show host Jimmy Fallon does this segment on his show with Paris Hilton

04:12.360 --> 04:15.200
where they show off their pictures of Board Apes.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
This is your apes?

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
We debuted.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.200
That's really cool.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
The hat, the shades.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.200
We're part of the same community.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.200
We're both apes.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.200
Love it.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.200
This is my apes.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
This is yours.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
Yours is so cool.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.200
I love the Red Heart sunglasses.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.200
I love the Captain hat.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.200
It reminded me of me a little bit.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
Look at this.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
They look like they could be friends.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.200
They're buddies.

04:32.200 --> 04:43.200
This was the point in which I started to wonder, okay, what is actually happening?

04:43.200 --> 04:46.200
And I think a lot of people started to as well.

04:46.200 --> 04:51.200
You start to realize that the purchase of Beeple's artwork, that wasn't done through

04:51.200 --> 04:53.200
$69.3 million in cash.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.200
That purchase was made using crypto currencies.

04:56.200 --> 05:01.200
In fact, all the NFT purchases that we were seeing, they were done through cryptocurrency.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.200
The mysterious individual who purchased Beeple's artwork that went by the pseudonym MetaCovid

05:06.200 --> 05:11.200
turns out it's this guy called Vignesh Sundaresan who is already a cryptocurrency entrepreneur

05:11.200 --> 05:15.200
and had a working relationship with Beeple months prior to the big sale.

05:15.200 --> 05:20.200
And whilst there was all this talk about the revolutionary potential behind what we're

05:20.200 --> 05:24.200
seeing, there was another side of the story that was being painted by people who are far

05:24.200 --> 05:27.200
skeptical and those voices had a clear warning.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.200
What you are witnessing is a mania.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.200
We've got this system that is gleefully and gloriously corrupt.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.200
A mania that is being driven by greed.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.200
Get rich quick by investing in crypto currency.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.200
Mass delusion.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.200
My ape is an inner reflection of myself.

05:44.200 --> 05:50.200
Or, as other critics put it, it is a giant scam that has some of the largest names, brands,

05:50.200 --> 05:53.200
venture capital firms backing it knowingly or not.

05:53.200 --> 05:59.200
NFTs were just a component of a much bigger machine with a lot of moving pieces.

05:59.200 --> 06:05.200
And when you put those pieces together, it creates a machine for one of the greatest scams in human history.

06:05.200 --> 06:12.200
And it all begins here with a mysterious invention and a failed revolution.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.200
2008.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.200
That's where this really begins.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.200
Apple shares are just getting hammered this morning.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.200
We're down by between three and four and a half percent, generally.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.200
The United States is going through a recession it hasn't seen since the Great Depression.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.200
The consumers strangle.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.200
They're watching their housing prices go lower.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.200
They're watching their 401Ks get diminished.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.200
You created the mess we're in and now you're saying, sorry.

06:36.200 --> 06:42.200
Amongst the backdrop of this all, a mysterious individual is working on their own invention.

06:42.200 --> 06:46.200
On the 31st of October, they send an email to a cryptography mailing list.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.200
The email begins.

06:47.200 --> 06:53.200
I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer with no trusted third party.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.200
It was signed by somebody under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.200
Whoever this Nakamoto person was, they had a vision.

07:01.200 --> 07:08.200
The vision was to create a type of currency that existed digitally that could be controlled by no government or single individual

07:08.200 --> 07:13.200
that could be used to transact in globally no matter where you were or what time it was.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.200
The name of this currency and invention?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.200
Bitcoin.

07:18.200 --> 07:25.200
On January the 3rd, 2009, Nakamoto launches his invention, creating the first ever Bitcoins to exist.

07:25.200 --> 07:31.200
It was an attractive pitch, you know, especially to people who held anti-state control sentiments.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.200
We're talking about anarchists, techno-anarchists, libertarians, cypher-punks.

07:35.200 --> 07:41.200
These were individuals who likely saw the government, the banks, the entire financial institution as just untrustworthy.

07:41.200 --> 07:45.200
That they can't be allowed to control monetary policy.

07:45.200 --> 07:50.200
And it was these factions that became the first adopters of Bitcoin influencing its early culture.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.200
The goal was simple.

07:52.200 --> 07:56.200
Preach the message of Bitcoin to others and increase its adoption.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.200
Bitcoin was kind of like a religion of its own, right?

08:00.200 --> 08:06.200
Like Satoshi Nakamoto was this Jesus-like figure that would communicate with his disciples on online forums.

08:06.200 --> 08:11.200
We would talk of this future vision of the world, you know, one where the dollar no longer existed

08:11.200 --> 08:17.200
and all transactions would be made through Bitcoin, the global currency of the people that was owned by no central entity.

08:17.200 --> 08:23.200
To those early adopters of Bitcoin, they really felt like they were on the cusp of something revolutionary.

08:23.200 --> 08:29.200
It just so happened that the more people started buying into the message, the higher Bitcoin's value rose

08:29.200 --> 08:33.200
and the more people were willing to like put real dollars into buying Bitcoins.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.200
Bitcoin is now up to $111.

08:36.200 --> 08:41.200
Bitcoin started drawing attention from places it probably wasn't expecting or even wanting.

08:41.200 --> 08:46.200
The guys in suits, you know, the big money, the people who saw Bitcoin as revolutionary

08:46.200 --> 08:49.200
but perhaps more importantly as an opportunity.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.200
The Winklevoss twins were a perfect example of that.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.200
I mean, here you have two twins who have graduated from Harvard.

08:55.200 --> 09:01.200
They've won a settlement for $65 million against Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their initial idea of Facebook.

09:01.200 --> 09:06.200
They found out about Bitcoin on a holiday trip to Ibiza and they started buying as much as they could.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.200
They were stockpiling the currency.

09:08.200 --> 09:14.200
It was by around 2013 that they were rumored to own about 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.200
That, I think, was a perfect early warning of what was to come.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
Bitcoin was doomed from the start.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.200
That's what a lot of crypto skeptics will tell you and I understand why.

09:25.200 --> 09:33.200
Relying on computer code and the ideals of tech anarchists probably isn't the best place to entrust a reimagining of the financial system.

09:33.200 --> 09:38.200
Bitcoin had a fixed supply of 21 million coins which makes it deflationary by nature.

09:38.200 --> 09:44.200
So if one Bitcoin is worth more tomorrow than it is today, why would you want to use it to transact with?

09:44.200 --> 09:48.200
It's a pretty bad incentive to have if you're trying to make a global currency.

09:48.200 --> 09:54.200
But that is already assuming that Bitcoin had the technical capabilities to become this worldwide currency,

09:54.200 --> 09:55.200
which it didn't.

09:55.200 --> 10:00.200
Bitcoin had scaling issues thanks to design decisions that Nakamoto themselves had made.

10:00.200 --> 10:06.200
It could only process 7 transactions per second compared to other traditional payment networks like Visa,

10:06.200 --> 10:12.200
which can process 1700 transactions per second, or Mastercard, which handles 5000 transactions per second,

10:12.200 --> 10:17.200
and keeping the Bitcoin network running wasted a lot of energy.

10:17.200 --> 10:23.200
Bitcoin aimed to be decentralized, meaning no government or single entity had control over it.

10:23.200 --> 10:28.200
In order to do that, Nakamoto employed what is called a proof-of-work consensus model.

10:28.200 --> 10:35.200
All this meant was that computers on the Bitcoin network would be forced to use real-world energy in order to solve algorithmic problems,

10:35.200 --> 10:39.200
and whichever computers solved the problem first would be rewarded with more Bitcoins.

10:39.200 --> 10:44.200
It was a process called mining, and that process is insanely wasteful of energy.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.200
And what ends up happening?

10:45.200 --> 10:50.200
Proof-of-work incentivized this arms race between computers on the Bitcoin network,

10:50.200 --> 10:55.200
all of them looking to build more and more powerful computers to have a better chance of mining Bitcoin.

10:55.200 --> 10:59.200
And the more powerful those computers grew, the more real-world energy they ended up taking,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.200
despite the fact that the transactions per second remained the same.

11:02.200 --> 11:08.200
Most Bitcoin mining done today is done by huge mining farms in warehouses.

11:08.200 --> 11:13.200
Bitcoin, for the most part, failed in its objective of trying to become a global currency.

11:13.200 --> 11:18.200
Outside of illegal use purposes, Bitcoin just wasn't being used to transact with.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.200
So the obvious question becomes how?

11:21.200 --> 11:27.200
How is it that despite its failings, Bitcoin still survived and is very much present to this day?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.200
But that's just the thing.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.200
The Bitcoin that we see today is a shell of its former identity,

11:33.200 --> 11:37.200
where most of the purchasing of Bitcoin today happens on centralized exchanges

11:37.200 --> 11:40.200
that have to comply with the laws of centralized institutions.

11:40.200 --> 11:46.200
In the instances where you've heard about Bitcoin, or if you've ever been encouraged to buy Bitcoin,

11:46.200 --> 11:49.200
under what context is that always framed?

11:49.200 --> 11:56.200
By 2014, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto effectively vanished from the Internet and hasn't been heard from since.

11:56.200 --> 12:02.200
What was left of his invention was no longer a currency, it was something entirely different.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.200
Bernie Madoff.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.200
This was a guy who was well respected on Wall Street.

12:08.200 --> 12:11.200
He ran a brokerage firm with a wealth management branch.

12:11.200 --> 12:16.200
He had many clients investing with his firm under the promise of great returns on their money until...

12:16.200 --> 12:24.200
The FBI arrested him this morning after he told senior employees yesterday that his business was a giant Ponzi scheme.

12:24.200 --> 12:30.200
Madoff had been running the largest Ponzi scheme in history for the last 17 years and potentially longer,

12:30.200 --> 12:33.200
worth around $64.8 billion.

12:33.200 --> 12:39.200
He would essentially put his investors' money inside a bank account and then simply pay out early investors

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
with the money that new investors were giving.

12:41.200 --> 12:46.200
Now Madoff eventually pleaded guilty and he was imprisoned up until his death in 2021.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.200
That is the essence of any Ponzi scheme.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.200
People invest into the scheme under this promise that they're going to make a great amount of returns

12:54.200 --> 12:58.200
and then early investors are paid using the money of new investors.

12:58.200 --> 13:05.200
And this process is repeated on and on until eventually you run out of new recruits to keep investing money into the scheme

13:05.200 --> 13:08.200
or eventually people start trying to cash out and it just collapses,

13:08.200 --> 13:15.200
which tends to leave early investors with profits and the large majority of others with nothing but losses.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.200
People hearing about Bitcoin would hear about two things.

13:18.200 --> 13:22.200
One, that it was revolutionary and two, that it was a valuable.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.200
That if you buy now, you could be rich later.

13:25.200 --> 13:33.200
If you really, really want to become wealthy in the future, I suggest you take one fricking dollar, buy some Bitcoin.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.200
Bitcoin to me, it's not just an investment.

13:35.200 --> 13:41.200
It's not just a maybe a get rich quick scheme as a lot of people put it, but I see it as the future of currency.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.200
I see it as the future of the financial system.

13:43.200 --> 13:48.200
So you realize that most of the people buying Bitcoin, they're not buying it to use as a currency.

13:48.200 --> 13:53.200
They're buying it as an investment and therein lies the contradiction.

13:53.200 --> 13:58.200
Because the more people who used Bitcoin like an investment, the less liable Bitcoin became as a currency,

13:58.200 --> 14:02.200
the very thing it's being pitched as being revolutionary as.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.200
So you know what you end up with, right?

14:04.200 --> 14:06.200
Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme.

14:06.200 --> 14:11.200
The promise is you can get rich for free, magical internet money.

14:11.200 --> 14:16.200
Anyone who buys into the idea of Bitcoin is doing so to sell it for a higher price at a future date

14:16.200 --> 14:21.200
and the people that buy it off those people are also looking to sell it for a higher price at a future date.

14:21.200 --> 14:26.200
The only way to make money from your Bitcoin investment is using the money of new investors.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.200
You hear about people making money in Bitcoin.

14:29.200 --> 14:34.200
They only make money because some other sucker lost more.

14:34.200 --> 14:39.200
And unlike Bernie Madoff, right, who gets all the blame and the satisfying jail time at the end of his story,

14:39.200 --> 14:46.200
here you have an entity that isn't owned by anyone or some would argue isn't a decentralized currency.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.200
It's a decentralized Ponzi scheme.

14:48.200 --> 14:54.200
Now Ponzi schemes are kept alive by continuously finding new recruits and new markets to tap into

14:54.200 --> 14:57.200
so that money is continuously being poured into the scheme.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.200
And so you start to see this similar incentive develop in the crypto space.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.200
This desperate need to find a use case for this stuff.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.200
And that use case has to be revolutionary enough to justify its rising value.

15:08.200 --> 15:16.200
Bitcoin may have been the first part of this machine, but things were about to get a whole lot more interesting.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.200
Bitcoin had something going for it.

15:18.200 --> 15:22.200
The blockchain system that kept it running was somewhat unique.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.200
Okay, so let's not complicate things, right?

15:24.200 --> 15:30.200
You can think of Bitcoin like a digital spreadsheet that records transactions being used in the currency.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.200
It's not a physical coin. It's just data on a database.

15:33.200 --> 15:40.200
After a certain number of transactions are made, a brand new spreadsheet is created that links to the previous one and on and on and on it goes.

15:40.200 --> 15:45.200
Instead of using real names, users are recognized through what are called wallet addresses,

15:45.200 --> 15:48.200
which appear as a random string of numbers and letters.

15:48.200 --> 15:54.200
And all of this is kind of kept together using computer code, cryptography, and the network of miners that are running it,

15:54.200 --> 15:57.200
which is where the word cryptocurrency comes from.

15:57.200 --> 16:03.200
So what was essentially just an immutable, append-only database was touted as revolutionary.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.200
You know, blockchain was no longer just blockchain, it was blockchain technology.

16:06.200 --> 16:12.200
And it wasn't long before people started to see the success and the ideals that Bitcoin was based off

16:12.200 --> 16:16.200
and begin creating their own cryptocurrencies using this blockchain system.

16:19.200 --> 16:25.200
Vitalik Buterin, a teenager who decided to quit his favorite video game at World of Warcraft

16:25.200 --> 16:29.200
after his Warlock character had a damaged component removed by the game developers.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.200
Vitalik says that he cried himself to sleep that night.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.200
That was the day that he realized the horrors that centralized services bring.

16:36.200 --> 16:42.200
It sounds a bit ridiculous, but Vitalik would end up discovering Bitcoin in 2011

16:42.200 --> 16:44.200
and he would start writing for a Bitcoin magazine.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.200
It all appealed to his ideals.

16:46.200 --> 16:54.200
In 2015, Vitalik and several other co-founders launched the creation of their own blockchain-based invention.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.200
It was called Ethereum.

16:55.200 --> 17:01.200
Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum had its own blockchain and it had its own native currency, which was called Ether.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.200
There was one important difference, though.

17:03.200 --> 17:09.200
You see, Ethereum allowed its users to actually program applications on its blockchain.

17:09.200 --> 17:15.200
Put it this way, if Bitcoin was like a spreadsheet, then Ethereum was like an Excel spreadsheet

17:15.200 --> 17:19.200
that allowed users to create functions to perform various different tasks.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.200
It was, you know, a little more advanced.

17:21.200 --> 17:27.200
It was a glimpse of hope at finding the revolutionary use cases the cryptocurrency world needed

17:27.200 --> 17:30.200
in order to justify the growing value that was being pumped into the system.

17:30.200 --> 17:35.200
So, what was the first thing that people started using Ethereum for?

17:35.200 --> 17:37.200
Creating more cryptocurrencies.

17:37.200 --> 17:43.200
And today we will be creating our own cryptocurrency in under 10 or maybe even under 5 minutes.

17:43.200 --> 17:48.200
Rather than needing to create your own blockchain and network, you could just use Ethereum's blockchain

17:48.200 --> 17:52.200
to create your own cryptocurrencies or crypto assets, as people called them.

17:52.200 --> 17:57.200
These assets that existed without their own native blockchain were called tokens.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.200
There are now over 1500 cryptocurrencies.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.200
It became known as the ICO mania.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.200
It was supposed to be this new way to fund your business.

18:06.200 --> 18:10.200
Businesses could create their own token coins, release what is called a whitepaper,

18:10.200 --> 18:15.200
which explains what the project aimed to do, and then they could sell those tokens to the public.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.200
Otherwise known as an initial coin offering, ICO.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.200
A whole wave of these token coins were being released.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.200
Some of them parodies and others were just blatant scams.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
It's coin.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.200
The Whopper coin.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.200
Trump coin.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.200
Kodak coin.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
Insane coin.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
But here it is.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.200
I created a dictator coin.

18:32.200 --> 18:37.200
Jesus coin was a token coin that was promising to decentralize Jesus on the blockchain.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
On its whitepaper, its creators stated,

18:39.200 --> 18:44.200
they were in early talks with churches to provide miracles exclusively to Jesus coin owners.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.200
Ponzi coin was very much open about the fact that it was a scam.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.200
Their website literally said it right there.

18:50.200 --> 18:55.200
It's as much as a scam as 99% of the ICOs out there, but it's more transparent about it.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.200
Ponzi coin still managed to raise $250,000.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.200
It didn't matter if the idea was good enough or not,

19:02.200 --> 19:04.200
or if it even solved the problems it was claiming to solve.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.200
All that mattered was that people believed in the token enough

19:07.200 --> 19:11.200
so that the value would rise and it would pay off the early investors who got in at the start.

19:11.200 --> 19:15.200
There was one that you invested in that saw like 2,000% growth last month.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
Yep.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.200
What was it?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
That was Dabber coin.

19:18.200 --> 19:23.200
It also marked the beginning of an unlikely friendship between those in the cryptocurrency space

19:23.200 --> 19:25.200
and influencers and celebrities.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.200
If token coins were fueled by hype and attention,

19:28.200 --> 19:32.200
then celebrities and influencers were the ones that were running the gas stations.

19:32.200 --> 19:36.200
Famous professional boxer Floyd Mayweather along with producer DJ Khaled

19:36.200 --> 19:43.200
were paid $100,000 and $50,000 respectively to promote the token coin Centratec in 2017.

19:43.200 --> 19:49.200
Centratec was a project that was promising to deliver financial services to the cryptocurrency world.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
The coin had raised $32 million.

19:51.200 --> 19:56.200
Turns out they lied about their CEO who wasn't even a real person that existed.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.200
They lied about business deals with Mastercard and Visa

19:59.200 --> 20:03.200
and its co-founder Sam Sharma was eventually sentenced to eight years in prison.

20:03.200 --> 20:08.200
ICOs effectively became a casino to gamble unregistered securities,

20:08.200 --> 20:11.200
but you have to remember the hidden incentives.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.200
No matter how fraudulent or bizarre everything looks on the outside in the crypto world,

20:15.200 --> 20:18.200
you have to keep clushing at potential use cases

20:18.200 --> 20:23.200
or anything that will justify its value constantly rising to new investors.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.200
And whilst the ICO mania of 2017 was continuing,

20:26.200 --> 20:29.200
a whole new idea was coming to fruition.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.200
So how many of y'all have heard of this new game that came out recently?

20:33.200 --> 20:36.200
I don't know how do we actually describe what these things are.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.200
And today we're talking about crypto kitties.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.200
Crypto kitties was probably one of the first NFT projects to make it into the spotlight.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.200
Crypto kitties.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.200
Crypto kitties.

20:45.200 --> 20:50.200
The viral blockchain-based game that sparked a global craze for virtual cats.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
It's a picture of a cat.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.200
You logged onto the site, you created an account that was connected to your crypto wallet,

20:55.200 --> 21:00.200
and you'd play this game in which you would collect, breed and sell virtual cats for cryptocurrency.

21:00.200 --> 21:07.200
The key pitch here though is that every cat is its own unique token that exists on the Ethereum blockchain,

21:07.200 --> 21:10.200
making them what you would essentially call a non-fungible,

21:10.200 --> 21:14.200
or as they're often called now, a non-fungible token, an NFT.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.200
Think of it like a digital beanie babies.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.200
Now if that sounds a little weird, it's because it is.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.200
Crypto kitties became like its own mania.

21:23.200 --> 21:27.200
It generated $3 million within its first week of launch

21:27.200 --> 21:32.200
and accounted for roughly 10 to 13% of all traffic on Ethereum's network.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.200
And where was everyone's focus during that mania?

21:35.200 --> 21:39.200
Okay, that's $2,700 for this little guy.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
Why use these crypto kitties?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.200
$450,000 for this ugly mug.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.200
The same reason you started out with the cryptocurrency.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.200
To make money.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.200
Guys, this is a potential way to make some money.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.200
This is insane.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
Most users are trying to breed their cats at the moment,

21:51.200 --> 21:55.200
not just because it's kind of cool, but also because they can be very expensive.

21:55.200 --> 21:59.200
There are thousands of people playing on the Crypto Kitties website.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.200
Once everyone started rushing to join in on the hype,

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
the economics of the game began to falter

22:03.200 --> 22:07.200
as the supply of crypto kitties stretched far beyond the demand,

22:07.200 --> 22:10.200
eventually leading to a crash in the price of crypto kitties

22:10.200 --> 22:12.200
and a fall in average users.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.200
Because as you continue to see time and time again,

22:16.200 --> 22:19.200
almost everyone was there to make money.

22:19.200 --> 22:23.200
But what remained of that saga was the idea of non-fungible assets.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.200
A brand new package, a brand new pitch,

22:25.200 --> 22:30.200
a new route to find use cases for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

22:30.200 --> 22:36.200
This stuff was initially pitched to digital artists.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.200
The idea was that you would make artwork,

22:38.200 --> 22:40.200
then tokenize that artwork,

22:40.200 --> 22:44.200
which just means turning it into a token that exists on a blockchain like Ethereum.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.200
If you wanted to know who owned the artwork,

22:46.200 --> 22:50.200
all you had to do was just go and check the blockchain records

22:50.200 --> 22:53.200
and see which wallet was associated with the artwork.

22:53.200 --> 22:57.200
In theory, you could digitally verify the ownership of your art.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.200
Sounds exciting.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
You might think.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.200
I did too.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.200
Digital artist Michael Winkleman, otherwise known as Beeple,

23:04.200 --> 23:08.200
began a challenge in 2007 where he would create one piece of artwork

23:08.200 --> 23:11.200
every single day and continue to do so throughout the years.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.200
It was known as his every day's collection.

23:14.200 --> 23:18.200
But to me, the bigger project is this long-term every day's project,

23:18.200 --> 23:21.200
which is a project that I've been working on, you know,

23:21.200 --> 23:23.200
every single day for over 12 years.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.200
It was reportedly around October of 2020

23:26.200 --> 23:30.200
when Beeple was put in touch with an anonymous NFT artist called Pak

23:30.200 --> 23:34.200
and Pak informed Beeple about the world of NFTs.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.200
Only a few months later,

23:35.200 --> 23:37.200
he would end up auctioning a piece of artwork

23:37.200 --> 23:42.200
that contained a collage of the first 5,000 images of the Every Day series,

23:42.200 --> 23:45.200
titled Every Day's The First 5,000 Days.

23:45.200 --> 23:50.200
$69.3 million was how much it sold for in the Ether cryptocurrency,

23:50.200 --> 23:53.200
one of the largest sales in digital art history.

23:53.200 --> 23:57.200
The very sale that sent the search term NFT skyrocketing.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.200
So now the question becomes,

23:59.200 --> 24:02.200
who decided to make that purchase?

24:02.200 --> 24:07.200
So you purchased a collection of 5,000 pieces of digital art

24:07.200 --> 24:11.200
that anyone can easily see online for $69 million.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.200
Why did you do that?

24:13.200 --> 24:18.200
MetaCoven, or as they were later revealed to be Vignesh Sundaresan,

24:18.200 --> 24:21.200
a crypto entrepreneur who had recently co-founded

24:21.200 --> 24:25.200
a crypto investment firm with his business partner called Metapurse.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.200
Only a few months before this big $69 million purchase,

24:29.200 --> 24:31.200
MetaCoven and his business partner

24:31.200 --> 24:34.200
had already bought another collection of NFTs from Beeple

24:34.200 --> 24:36.200
for over $2.2 million.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.200
They actually wrote a blog post about their purchase,

24:39.200 --> 24:42.200
alluding to the fact that this was only part of a much bigger project

24:42.200 --> 24:44.200
that they had in mind that will quote,

24:44.200 --> 24:47.200
flip the art world status quo on its head.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.200
And what was that project that they were talking about?

24:50.200 --> 24:52.200
The B20 token coin.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.200
They were going to bundle their purchases of Beeple's NFT's collection

24:56.200 --> 25:00.200
and put it in a virtual museum where those who purchased the B20 token coin

25:00.200 --> 25:03.200
could access and view the artwork.

25:03.200 --> 25:07.200
Owning the B20 token was supposed to represent a type of fractional ownership

25:07.200 --> 25:10.200
in the virtual museum and the contents inside of it.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.200
Here's the thing,

25:11.200 --> 25:14.200
MetaCoven and his business partner conveniently owned

25:14.200 --> 25:18.200
59% of the total supply of B20 tokens.

25:18.200 --> 25:22.200
Beeple was also given 2% of that supply.

25:22.200 --> 25:26.200
Beeple and MetaCoven already had a working relationship

25:26.200 --> 25:29.200
before the big every day's 5,000 sale.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.200
When that sale happened and the media frenzy ensued,

25:32.200 --> 25:36.200
the B20 token rose in value to $23

25:36.200 --> 25:39.200
as more people began obviously looking into who MetaCoven was.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.200
People have accused that sale of essentially being

25:42.200 --> 25:46.200
a giant marketing stunt to increase the value of the B20 token.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.200
Even in their calls together,

25:48.200 --> 25:51.200
you can hear Beeple express skepticism around the whole thing

25:51.200 --> 25:54.200
only for MetaCoven and the others to kind of bring him around.

25:54.200 --> 25:58.200
Other artists I can almost guarantee will not like this.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
Like they will not like you taking their work

26:00.200 --> 26:02.200
and like splitting it into a million pieces

26:02.200 --> 26:04.200
and reselling those pieces.

26:04.200 --> 26:08.200
That I would be very surprised if other artists

26:08.200 --> 26:12.200
did not have a very strong dislike of that.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.200
But what I find the most insane about this saga

26:15.200 --> 26:18.200
was that the B20 virtual museum

26:18.200 --> 26:21.200
that was supposed to flip the art world status quo

26:21.200 --> 26:23.200
was nothing impressive.

26:23.200 --> 26:27.200
The B20 token has fallen over 99% in value

26:27.200 --> 26:29.200
since its all time high.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.200
Despite all of this, MetaCoven's sales

26:32.200 --> 26:34.200
sent headlines skyrocketing.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.200
Suddenly NFTs were being created out of internet memes

26:37.200 --> 26:40.200
or anything really that was culturally relevant to the internet.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.200
From the outside, all you had to know

26:42.200 --> 26:44.200
were that NFTs were revolutionary

26:44.200 --> 26:46.200
and there was a lot of money involved.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.200
You didn't even have to know that they were intrinsically tied

26:48.200 --> 26:51.200
to the world of cryptocurrencies or blockchain.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.200
A successful repackaging.

26:53.200 --> 26:57.200
Once the sale of memes and other one-off NFT sales cooled down,

26:57.200 --> 27:01.200
it became more popular to start buying into NFT projects.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.200
These contained up to thousands of NFTs inside of them,

27:04.200 --> 27:07.200
usually following a certain theme or concept.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.200
What are crypto punks?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.200
These are the crypto punks.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.200
They are 25 by 25 pixels.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.200
They're icons of zombies.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.200
There's aliens, zombies, and they all have different mohawks

27:18.200 --> 27:21.200
and glasses and beard types.

27:21.200 --> 27:25.200
What is Cool Cat? The coolest NFTs on the blockchain?

27:25.200 --> 27:27.200
Shoot, I got a lazy lion's NFT

27:27.200 --> 27:30.200
thinking about joining this amazing community.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.200
Clone X. This project is previously known as Akira.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
Sneaky Vampire Syndicate.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.200
They've got Pudgy Penguins on the chopping block today.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.200
Just as it had been with Bitcoin and Token Coins,

27:41.200 --> 27:44.200
the name of the game was about hyping up projects

27:44.200 --> 27:46.200
that you can sell it for profit later.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.200
NFTs, though, were cooler than your average Token Coins,

27:49.200 --> 27:51.200
so they had art behind them.

27:51.200 --> 27:54.200
You could show them off by replacing your social media profile picture

27:54.200 --> 27:56.200
with an NFT you purchased.

27:56.200 --> 28:00.200
More so than ever, hype and attention became an important part

28:00.200 --> 28:03.200
of growing the value of an NFT,

28:03.200 --> 28:05.200
which brings us to the apes.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.200
One of the most significant projects created after Beeple's sale

28:09.200 --> 28:11.200
was the Board Ape Yacht Club,

28:11.200 --> 28:13.200
otherwise shortened to just Basie.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.200
Founded by the company Yuga Labs,

28:15.200 --> 28:18.200
the project featured 10,000 different pictures of apes

28:18.200 --> 28:21.200
with this distinct board expression on their face.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.200
The Board Ape Yacht Club project had managed to arrive

28:24.200 --> 28:26.200
into the NFT space at just the right time,

28:26.200 --> 28:28.200
about a month after Beeple's big sale.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.200
There were a few popular people inside of the NFT space,

28:31.200 --> 28:34.200
already one of which went by the name of Jimmy McNeil

28:34.200 --> 28:37.200
otherwise known as JimmyEath on Twitter,

28:37.200 --> 28:40.200
who shortly after finding out about the project,

28:40.200 --> 28:43.200
announces their purchase of hundreds of Board Ape NFTs.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.200
Then another popular figure in the NFT space, Pranksy,

28:46.200 --> 28:49.200
who had around 50,000 followers at the time,

28:49.200 --> 28:52.200
tweets their own purchase of 250 Board Apes,

28:52.200 --> 28:54.200
which later grows to 1,250.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.200
And all the time these guys are tweeting about their purchases

28:57.200 --> 29:01.200
to their followers, it starts to create this buzz inside of the crypto space.

29:01.200 --> 29:06.200
You've probably seen all over Twitter this crazy, crazy thing with apes.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.200
Just after 12 hours of its official launch,

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
the Basie Collection sold out,

29:11.200 --> 29:15.200
giving Yuga Labs an estimated $2.8 million in revenue.

29:15.200 --> 29:19.200
Pranksy starts selling some of his apes to NBA players

29:19.200 --> 29:22.200
who start tweeting and changing their profile pictures to those apes.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.200
In August, the popular DJ, Steve Aoki,

29:25.200 --> 29:28.200
tweets his own $40,000 purchase of a Board Ape

29:28.200 --> 29:30.200
to his millions of followers.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.200
Tag Ape, follow Ape, began trending immediately.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.200
Famous digital artist Meeple tweeting about it

29:35.200 --> 29:37.200
and creating an artwork about it,

29:37.200 --> 29:40.200
which continued to drive up the price of Board Apes.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.200
You ape, me ape, a friend.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.200
One of the shadiest parts about everything that followed

29:47.200 --> 29:51.200
were the blurred lines between celebrities and influencers

29:51.200 --> 29:54.200
clearly manipulating a market to pump up the value of their NFTs

29:54.200 --> 29:57.200
and genuine posts simply just showing off their purchases.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.200
You had Justin Bieber in January of this year

29:59.200 --> 30:02.200
posting a picture of a Board Ape number 3001

30:02.200 --> 30:05.200
to his 251 million followers,

30:05.200 --> 30:09.200
a purchase that was reportedly worth $1.3 million.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.200
Everyone sort of assumes that Justin

30:11.200 --> 30:13.200
was the one that made the purchase himself, right?

30:13.200 --> 30:15.200
And he's just posting it on his Instagram.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.200
But then Twitter users started to look into the records

30:18.200 --> 30:21.200
and they find that Justin's supposed crypto wallet

30:21.200 --> 30:24.200
had received 900 ether from another wallet address.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.200
And that wallet address was associated

30:26.200 --> 30:29.200
with an individual named Jean Piero di Alessandro

30:29.200 --> 30:31.200
or, as many others may recognize him,

30:31.200 --> 30:33.200
Justin Bieber's business partner.

30:33.200 --> 30:37.200
And Jean Piero owned his own NFT collection called Inbetweeners

30:37.200 --> 30:40.200
which Bieber had been promoting on social media already.

30:40.200 --> 30:43.200
In those posts, no disclaimer was made suggesting

30:43.200 --> 30:45.200
that Bieber had been paid to promote them.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.200
I just got my first NFT.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.200
You did? What was it?

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
I threw MoonPay.

30:49.200 --> 30:53.200
In some of the announcements from celebrities about their NFT purchases

30:53.200 --> 30:56.200
there was this constant reference to a company called MoonPay,

30:56.200 --> 30:59.200
thanking them for help with purchasing their NFTs.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.200
I got an Ape too because I saw you on the show with people

31:02.200 --> 31:03.200
and you said you got a MoonPay.

31:03.200 --> 31:07.200
Turns out MoonPay was a company that was launched in 2019

31:07.200 --> 31:10.200
which according to their website had one singular aim,

31:10.200 --> 31:13.200
to increase cryptocurrency adoption.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.200
So that begs the question,

31:14.200 --> 31:17.200
what is the relationship between MoonPay

31:17.200 --> 31:20.200
and the supposed celebrities and influences

31:20.200 --> 31:22.200
they're helping by NFTs?

31:22.200 --> 31:25.200
We'll talk, not once, not twice.

31:25.200 --> 31:30.200
So we targets have an offer to support a true MoonPay.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.200
At the end of the NDAs they try to send my each agency to, you know,

31:33.200 --> 31:37.200
they want you to not disclose that they had purchased the NFT.

31:37.200 --> 31:40.200
Isn't it a little shady that you have the CEO of MoonPay,

31:40.200 --> 31:42.200
a guy called Ivan Soto Wright,

31:42.200 --> 31:45.200
who is an active participant in the NFT market,

31:45.200 --> 31:47.200
who is clearly well connected to the celebrities

31:47.200 --> 31:49.200
using his company's service,

31:49.200 --> 31:51.200
who has access to insider information

31:51.200 --> 31:54.200
and likely knows when celebrities may purchase an NFT

31:54.200 --> 31:55.200
before they do it.

31:55.200 --> 31:58.200
And surprise, surprise, people started finding out

31:58.200 --> 32:01.200
that Wright on numerous occasions has purchased NFT projects

32:01.200 --> 32:04.200
right before celebrities end up purchasing them.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.200
Prominent cryptoskeptic and author David Gerrard

32:09.200 --> 32:11.200
had this post on his blog.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.200
It was titled CryptoGrifters Try to Scam Artists Again.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.200
He wrote,

32:19.200 --> 32:21.200
Tell artists there's a gusher of free money.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.200
NFTs are the future.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.200
If you want to get an NFTs,

32:24.200 --> 32:27.200
you're guaranteed to make some money because it's new, it's fresh.

32:27.200 --> 32:31.200
Two, they need to buy into crypto to get the gusher of free money.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.200
Three, they become crypto advocates

32:33.200 --> 32:36.200
and make excuses for proof of work and so on.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.200
Four, a few artists really are making life-changing money from this.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.200
Five, you probably won't be one of them.

32:42.200 --> 32:45.200
It's sold to you as this amazing thing

32:45.200 --> 32:48.200
where art is digitally verified on the blockchain.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.200
And that pitch makes you think that on the blockchain,

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
when you purchase an NFT,

32:52.200 --> 32:55.200
there's literally an entry that shows your wallet

32:55.200 --> 32:58.200
and the actual image of the NFT you purchased right there.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.200
You want to know what is actually the case with most NFTs?

33:01.200 --> 33:04.200
There is no picture attached to the transaction.

33:04.200 --> 33:08.200
Instead, it's usually a HTTPS or IPFS link

33:08.200 --> 33:10.200
containing the stored NFT image.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.200
So what you're purchasing with most NFTs

33:13.200 --> 33:16.200
is just an entry in a database that contains a link to the image

33:16.200 --> 33:19.200
that anyone else can also access.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.200
A little misleading to call that ownership.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.200
But I guess at the end of the day,

33:23.200 --> 33:26.200
that doesn't matter when, just like ICOs,

33:26.200 --> 33:29.200
NFTs were just another speculative financial investment

33:29.200 --> 33:30.200
to throw your money into.

33:30.200 --> 33:34.200
And to do that, you had to buy into cryptocurrencies.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.200
More money funneled into the machine.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.200
In my experience of looking into crypto communities

33:41.200 --> 33:43.200
and its culture and various projects,

33:43.200 --> 33:45.200
there is this game that is being played.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.200
Some are blatant about it and others less so.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.200
But the game is this.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.200
Everyone is playing a role in promoting their project,

33:52.200 --> 33:55.200
calling it revolutionary, saying that this isn't like the others,

33:55.200 --> 33:58.200
but ultimately, everyone knows that at some point,

33:58.200 --> 34:00.200
they're going to sell.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.200
And perhaps it is because of the greater full nature

34:02.200 --> 34:04.200
of the crypto ecosystem,

34:04.200 --> 34:07.200
where everyone is incentivized to keep putting money into the system

34:07.200 --> 34:11.200
and to keep pushing it while simultaneously dismissing criticism.

34:11.200 --> 34:14.200
On the surface, everything is supposed to be positive

34:14.200 --> 34:15.200
and optimistic.

34:15.200 --> 34:18.200
You have catchphrases and actions that are commonly used

34:18.200 --> 34:20.200
in cryptocurrency communities.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.200
HODL, short for hold on for dear life,

34:22.200 --> 34:25.200
which refers to holding onto your crypto assets no matter what.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.200
HODLing is seen as a good thing.

34:27.200 --> 34:30.200
Today, we're going to be talking about the art of the hole.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.200
HODL again, HODL again, HODL again.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.200
Wagameet, short for we're all going to make it,

34:34.200 --> 34:36.200
which is used as both a greeting

34:36.200 --> 34:38.200
and an easy catchphrase to keep morale high.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.200
We're all going to make it, and I say this,

34:40.200 --> 34:42.200
with passion and confidence.

34:42.200 --> 34:46.200
If you leave the market, if you give up, you will lose.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.200
That is the ultimate failure.

34:47.200 --> 34:51.200
We're still early is a sentiment often echoed in crypto communities

34:51.200 --> 34:54.200
and encouraging message for those who are both new and old in the space,

34:54.200 --> 34:57.200
letting them know that they haven't missed out on the opportunity

34:57.200 --> 34:59.200
and further riches are on the horizon.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.200
Don't abandon hope.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.200
Is it too late to get into crypto?

35:03.200 --> 35:04.200
No, never.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.200
It's never too late.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.200
It's actually too early.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.200
It's extremely early still.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.200
Those who hold onto their crypto assets,

35:09.200 --> 35:11.200
even when there is really good reason to sell,

35:11.200 --> 35:13.200
are called diamond hands.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.200
Diamond hands is actually a requirement.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
Keep diamond handing, OK?

35:16.200 --> 35:18.200
A positive trait that is encouraged,

35:18.200 --> 35:21.200
whereas those who do sell are labeled paper hands.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.200
A negative trait which is actively discouraged.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.200
The worst part about paper-handed investors

35:27.200 --> 35:33.200
is that it influences other people to grow paper on their hands.

35:33.200 --> 35:36.200
Most crypto communities are encouraged to say good morning

35:36.200 --> 35:38.200
and good night to each other every day,

35:38.200 --> 35:40.200
and listen to just a GM and GN,

35:40.200 --> 35:43.200
kind of like a regular check-in and check-out with members.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.200
Negativity is usually handled in the same way,

35:45.200 --> 35:49.200
since one group's negativity can actually devalue a project

35:49.200 --> 35:51.200
and affect everyone else's ability to make money.

35:51.200 --> 35:55.200
If there's some bad news about a particular cryptocurrency project

35:55.200 --> 35:57.200
or cryptocurrencies in general,

35:57.200 --> 35:59.200
it can be dismissed as fud,

35:59.200 --> 36:02.200
an abbreviation for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.200
We have someone that, again, is trying to spread fud.

36:06.200 --> 36:10.200
They just couldn't sit idly by and let people fud my investment

36:10.200 --> 36:13.200
and fud the leader of my investment.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.200
Or those who criticize are told,

36:15.200 --> 36:18.200
you simply don't understand without any further elaboration.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.200
Or they're told to have fun staying poor,

36:21.200 --> 36:25.200
which is a not-so-subtle nod to people's true intentions within the space.

36:25.200 --> 36:29.200
Or criticism is actually spun into a good thing for the project.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.200
These are all very convenient actions to encourage

36:32.200 --> 36:35.200
when keeping someone engaged and hopeful in a crypto project

36:35.200 --> 36:38.200
is financially beneficial to everyone else.

36:39.200 --> 36:43.200
I'm actually struck by how much the general public really hates it

36:43.200 --> 36:49.200
when someone gets into NFTs and they just have an absolute adverse reaction.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.200
I see this across industries.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
The NFT mania did something.

36:53.200 --> 36:58.200
I think it grew so big and so in-your-face from influencers and celebrities

36:58.200 --> 37:01.200
that it started making people mad.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.200
I'm so proud. I'm loving part of this community

37:03.200 --> 37:06.200
and being a voice and sharing my platform and just getting the word out there.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.200
What community? What are you guys talking about?

37:08.200 --> 37:10.200
You don't fucking care about this.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.200
I hate that they try to put on that they care about this.

37:12.200 --> 37:19.200
Board a yacht club NFTs, which I think are ugly, dumb, cringe.

37:19.200 --> 37:23.200
Thank you guys for allowing me to scream about NFT cartoons.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.200
I hate this stuff. It's getting worse.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.200
Check this out. I got a board bunny.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.200
And not only is it a board bunny, but it looks like me. Look at that.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.200
Nothing makes people hate you faster than NFT shilling.

37:33.200 --> 37:38.200
If you're young and naive, just like my brother and want to get into NFTs,

37:38.200 --> 37:39.200
you should check out Board Bunny.

37:39.200 --> 37:44.200
The new Board Bunny NFT project has now been classified as a scam.

37:44.200 --> 37:47.200
I welcome David Doberk to the long list of influencers promoting scams.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.200
Further claiming the team has disappeared with $6 million.

37:50.200 --> 37:54.200
It's great to be a part of this project. I love the designs inspired by Pokemon.

37:54.200 --> 37:58.200
It's a Pokemon knockoff. It's just like stealing money from people who are fans of Pokemon.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
Y'all better not miss this.

37:59.200 --> 38:03.200
They promised Pokemon partnerships and it was all a lie

38:03.200 --> 38:06.200
and it ended up raking in $6.3 million.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.200
For the last six months, I've been working on my own NFT project.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.200
The project is called CryptoZoo.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.200
I believe it's going to change the game.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.200
CryptoZoo, Logan Paul's newest project,

38:16.200 --> 38:20.200
are basically a bunch of stock photos from Adobe that have been poorly photoshopped.

38:20.200 --> 38:25.200
Unfungible tokens. Yes, I do know what they are, but I don't really like them at all really.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.200
I'm not really into them.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.200
Nobody seems to like NFTs.

38:28.200 --> 38:32.200
We didn't find anybody who actually had anything positive to say about them.

38:32.200 --> 38:36.200
Whenever a big celebrity or influencer would post something related to NFTs on their social media,

38:36.200 --> 38:39.200
you'd see a whole slew of people responding with,

38:39.200 --> 38:41.200
oh no, not you too.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.200
And this wasn't just limited to individuals either.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.200
Companies began getting a lot of flak for even talking about or dabbling into NFTs.

38:47.200 --> 38:52.200
In 2021, people found out what cryptocurrency actually was and they hated.

38:52.200 --> 38:57.200
It is all get rich quick schemes promoted using technology as the cover.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.200
All of it.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.200
That's what crypto is.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.200
And NFT is the latest species.

39:01.200 --> 39:05.200
I think in June of 1500, computer scientists and technologists directed Congress

39:05.200 --> 39:09.200
calling for more responsible regulation of crypto assets.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.200
They said the catastrophes and externalities related to blockchain technologies

39:13.200 --> 39:17.200
and crypto asset investments are the inevitable outcomes of a technology

39:17.200 --> 39:20.200
that is not built for purpose and will remain forever unsuitable

39:20.200 --> 39:23.200
as a foundation for large scale economic activity.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.200
And so you start to wonder, okay, what's going to happen?

39:26.200 --> 39:29.200
And I know that it really shouldn't surprise me,

39:29.200 --> 39:34.200
but a whole new packaging had been in the works and a brand new word was taking the stage.

39:36.200 --> 39:41.200
Our mission at MoonPay is to onboard the world to Web 3.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.200
I have to admit, it's a pretty convincing narrative.

39:44.200 --> 39:47.200
The first iteration of the Internet, Web 1.0,

39:47.200 --> 39:52.200
was essentially the first version of the web mostly consisting of web pages and information.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.200
There wasn't much you could actually interact with.

39:54.200 --> 39:59.200
Then came along Web 2.0, which brought access to many new features.

39:59.200 --> 40:04.200
It focused on user generated content, social media and more forms of participation.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.200
This version of the Internet became dominated by large corporations.

40:08.200 --> 40:12.200
Web 2.0 is our current modern day version of the Internet.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.200
But now Web 3.0 is coming.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.200
It kind of just referred to a bunch of different things,

40:18.200 --> 40:21.200
but the idea was that a new version of the Internet is here,

40:21.200 --> 40:27.200
where your online activity was going to be making use of blockchains and tokens to some degree or another.

40:27.200 --> 40:31.200
So in theory, the now centralized version of the Internet owned by Big Tech

40:31.200 --> 40:34.200
would become owned now by its users.

40:34.200 --> 40:39.200
In its initial bubble, NFTs were seen as just digital art, right, which is quite limiting.

40:39.200 --> 40:43.200
At the end of the day, NFTs are just data on a public database

40:43.200 --> 40:46.200
that can act as a receipt of ownership over whatever that data contained.

40:46.200 --> 40:50.200
You know, whether it was a coin or it was a web link to a digital piece of art.

40:50.200 --> 40:55.200
The idea was that if NFTs could prove ownership over something,

40:55.200 --> 40:57.200
then you could put anything on the blockchain.

40:57.200 --> 41:01.200
Real estate titles, medical records, university degrees, legal records.

41:01.200 --> 41:05.200
In the case of Web 3.0, you'd have social media sites and video games,

41:05.200 --> 41:08.200
all incorporating blockchain and NFTs into their business model.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.200
It didn't really matter what it was or how it would work exactly.

41:11.200 --> 41:16.200
It just became this game of insert anything here, but on the blockchain.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.200
And just like that, you've made it revolutionary.

41:18.200 --> 41:22.200
You've just recreated the entire mortgage infrastructure that already exists today.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.200
On the blockchain.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
Exactly.

41:24.200 --> 41:28.200
The blockchain in real estate is going to be pretty mainstream five to ten years from now.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.200
These solar grids, electric grids, self-driving car grids,

41:31.200 --> 41:35.200
that will essentially be machine run and controlled and administered by blockchains.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.200
The best use case for blockchain is healthcare.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.200
What can and can't be turned into an NFT?

41:40.200 --> 41:43.200
Ultimately, what we're talking about is the tokenization of everything.

41:43.200 --> 41:48.200
Never mind if blockchains or tokenization actually fixed the issues

41:48.200 --> 41:50.200
that it was claiming to solve in these industries.

41:50.200 --> 41:54.200
It was literally the definition of a solution in search of a problem.

41:54.200 --> 41:58.200
I'm lost as to why the on the blockchain part matters,

41:58.200 --> 42:00.200
besides basically what everyone means is they mean,

42:00.200 --> 42:04.200
oh, I want a public record of the transaction.

42:04.200 --> 42:05.200
Okay.

42:05.200 --> 42:10.200
I mean, people suggested that you could replace legal contracts with smart contracts,

42:10.200 --> 42:12.200
which are programs that are built on the blockchain.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.200
And that's usually accompanied with the phrase code is law.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.200
This is a smart contract.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.200
And this is a legal contract.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.200
These two things aren't the same, right?

42:20.200 --> 42:23.200
You can't have law be enacted by a computer code

42:23.200 --> 42:27.200
because law inherently requires third parties to assess evidence, intentions,

42:27.200 --> 42:31.200
and a bunch of other variables that you just can't outsource that to computer code,

42:31.200 --> 42:34.200
especially when that code is on the blockchain and it cannot be altered.

42:34.200 --> 42:39.200
Nicholas Weaver, a researcher and lecturer at UC Berkeley's Department for Computer Science,

42:39.200 --> 42:41.200
has this interview with Current Affairs,

42:41.200 --> 42:44.200
and he brought up what he called Weaver's Iron Law of blockchain.

42:44.200 --> 42:47.200
When somebody says you can solve X with blockchain,

42:47.200 --> 42:50.200
they don't understand X and you can just ignore them.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.200
So you start to wonder, right?

42:51.200 --> 42:56.200
Who is behind all of this money that's coming and pouring into the crypto and Web 3 space?

42:56.200 --> 42:58.200
Where is it coming from and why?

42:58.200 --> 43:02.200
Either I'm not seeing the revolutionary potential that all of this has,

43:02.200 --> 43:08.200
or this genuinely is a massive mania and bubble that is being fueled by greed and delusion.

43:08.200 --> 43:13.200
The so-called next version of the internet that's attracting big money from venture capital.

43:13.200 --> 43:17.200
Venture firm called Andreessen Horowitz, have you guys heard of it?

43:17.200 --> 43:20.200
I kept seeing this venture capital name pop up.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.200
We've been in the space for a long time.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.200
Kind of a big deal, running the crypto fund with more than 7 billion in capital to deploy.

43:26.200 --> 43:30.200
Andreessen Horowitz, otherwise known as A16Z,

43:30.200 --> 43:33.200
they're one of the largest venture capital firms.

43:33.200 --> 43:39.200
They have a crypto fund with around 7.6 billion to be invested in crypto and Web 3 startups,

43:39.200 --> 43:43.200
and have been investing in crypto companies dating back to 2013.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.200
If you wanted to meet the smart money behind all of this,

43:46.200 --> 43:48.200
then these guys were the best place to start.

43:48.200 --> 43:52.200
They say that crypto is far more than just a financial innovation.

43:52.200 --> 43:55.200
It's social, cultural, technological.

43:55.200 --> 44:01.200
In the month of October of 2021, A16Z led a funding of $115 million

44:01.200 --> 44:04.200
towards the company that was behind Axie Infinity.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.200
A16Z general partner, Ariana Simpson,

44:07.200 --> 44:12.200
claimed that this was an example of where Web 3 is going to revolutionize the internet.

44:12.200 --> 44:14.200
In her own words, literally,

44:14.200 --> 44:16.200
Axie embodies a new generation of games,

44:16.200 --> 44:18.200
what this means for the future of games,

44:18.200 --> 44:23.200
and really the web as we know it is as big as your imagination will allow.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.200
Where do I begin?

44:25.200 --> 44:28.200
Axie Infinity was what you would call a play to earn game.

44:28.200 --> 44:31.200
It was this new genre of games appearing in the Web 3 space,

44:31.200 --> 44:35.200
which, as the name suggests, allows players to make money when they play the game.

44:35.200 --> 44:39.200
In the case of Axie Infinity, what you had was this game where people would breed,

44:39.200 --> 44:42.200
collect, and fight with these creatures called Axies.

44:42.200 --> 44:46.200
When battling inside the game, it was possible to earn this token called SLP,

44:46.200 --> 44:48.200
which could actually be traded for real money.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.200
So what started happening?

44:50.200 --> 44:52.200
Well, people started playing the game,

44:52.200 --> 44:55.200
but instead of focusing on the fun of the game,

44:55.200 --> 44:58.200
the focus became on how to earn more SLP.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.200
How do you profit from Axie Infinity?

45:00.200 --> 45:04.200
The most expensive Axie ever sold was worth about $800,000.

45:04.200 --> 45:08.200
I've invested $13,232.

45:09.200 --> 45:14.200
To even play Axie Infinity, you had to purchase three Axie NFTs, right?

45:14.200 --> 45:16.200
And as the value of Axie NFTs started to rise,

45:16.200 --> 45:19.200
certain players wouldn't be able to afford the buy-in price.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.200
So guess what started happening?

45:21.200 --> 45:24.200
Those who had the money to buy three Axies

45:24.200 --> 45:27.200
began to lend their creatures out to players who couldn't afford it.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.200
They were called Scholars.

45:29.200 --> 45:33.200
How to set up your own scholarship program as a manager in Axie Infinity?

45:33.200 --> 45:35.200
I'll be giving out a scholarship every two weeks,

45:35.200 --> 45:37.200
so that's another six scholarships is my goal.

45:37.200 --> 45:41.200
Scholars would then play the game using their rented Axies,

45:41.200 --> 45:45.200
earn SLP, and then give a cut of their earnings to their managers.

45:45.200 --> 45:50.200
My team of 12 scholars was roughly earning me $1,700 a month.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.200
$600 from my scholars.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.200
With all of my current scholarships working,

45:54.200 --> 45:57.200
I'm earning about $6,000 a month.

45:57.200 --> 46:01.200
Axie Infinity, a play to earn crypto gaming juggernaut

46:01.200 --> 46:05.200
that has led people in countries like Philippines and Venezuela to make a living.

46:05.200 --> 46:09.200
These are players from the Philippines who are making a living playing Axie Infinity.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.200
Most of the scholars who couldn't afford the buy-in price,

46:11.200 --> 46:13.200
they were from developing countries, right?

46:13.200 --> 46:16.200
People who likely saw Axie Infinity not as a game of leisure,

46:16.200 --> 46:18.200
but as a means of producing income.

46:18.200 --> 46:22.200
I am here to apply scholarship on Axie Infinity.

46:22.200 --> 46:26.200
I want this scholarship because I want to earn more.

46:26.200 --> 46:30.200
I can play six to twelve hours a day just for playing Axie Infinity.

46:30.200 --> 46:33.200
I will treat this as a job, not just only a game.

46:33.200 --> 46:39.200
I want to help my family under expenses and save up money for my tuition and college.

46:39.200 --> 46:45.200
So I want to be a scholar so that I can meet the needs of my family.

46:45.200 --> 46:50.200
What you ended up with was a game where players are playing in order to make money.

46:50.200 --> 46:54.200
People are basically feeding their entire villagers playing our games.

46:54.200 --> 46:59.200
But the only reason that they're making money is because others are buying in to also make money.

46:59.200 --> 47:03.200
In the case of things like Axie Infinity, there actually are a bunch of innocent victims, right?

47:03.200 --> 47:07.200
When you run a pyramid scheme, unfortunately you get a bunch of poor people in the Philippines

47:07.200 --> 47:11.200
who are poor when they start and they're just hoping to make some money,

47:11.200 --> 47:13.200
but then what happens is they actually lose money.

47:13.200 --> 47:17.200
The value of SLP, which is the token that people use to actually make money in the game,

47:17.200 --> 47:22.200
has fallen 99% since its peak and its user base has been in decline since.

47:22.200 --> 47:27.200
Times Magazine came out with this article and it was interviewing this guy called Samerson Orias,

47:27.200 --> 47:31.200
a line cook from the Philippines who was facing financial stress after his mother had a stroke

47:31.200 --> 47:34.200
and electricity and grocery bills were stacking up.

47:34.200 --> 47:38.200
Orias jumped into the Axie Infinity game and then exited 14 months later.

47:38.200 --> 47:41.200
He described it as boring and stressful.

47:41.200 --> 47:45.200
Orias, along with other players of the game, told Times Magazine that Axie Infinity

47:45.200 --> 47:48.200
reinforced predatory systems and gave them false hope.

47:48.200 --> 47:53.200
It's already dystopian as hell, but then to say to people that by doing this

47:53.200 --> 47:58.200
we are creating opportunity for people in the developing world.

47:58.200 --> 48:02.200
That's not just dark, that's fucking evil.

48:02.200 --> 48:05.200
Again, I find myself coming back to the same question.

48:05.200 --> 48:10.200
What is it that VC firms are seeing the potential in in this crypto space?

48:10.200 --> 48:13.200
Why do they keep pouring money into it?

48:13.200 --> 48:16.200
The overwhelming majority of tokens are securities.

48:16.200 --> 48:19.200
But they're being dumped onto retail investors.

48:19.200 --> 48:22.200
This is being done explicitly by venture firms, I won't mention any names,

48:22.200 --> 48:26.200
who are buying into companies early, getting into tokens,

48:26.200 --> 48:29.200
and then those tokens are being listed on exchanges.

48:29.200 --> 48:33.200
The public is buying into them in order to get a financial gain.

48:33.200 --> 48:36.200
They have no interest in using those tokens for any utility.

48:36.200 --> 48:39.200
VC firms have a commonly used strategy.

48:39.200 --> 48:43.200
They invest in a bunch of startups, most of those startups will fail,

48:43.200 --> 48:45.200
a few will succeed, and with the ones that succeed,

48:45.200 --> 48:48.200
a VC needs to decide on an exit strategy,

48:48.200 --> 48:51.200
an event that allows them to liquidate their position in a company

48:51.200 --> 48:53.200
and essentially make money.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.200
This is a process that can take years.

48:55.200 --> 48:59.200
So there's another idea that is proposed by skeptics,

48:59.200 --> 49:04.200
that the world of crypto offers an incentive for VC firms to invest in a crypto company,

49:04.200 --> 49:06.200
receive a percentage of their tokens,

49:06.200 --> 49:10.200
and then sell those tokens to retail traders when it becomes publicly available.

49:10.200 --> 49:15.200
All achievable within months, highly profitable, and fairly unregulated.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.200
With crypto tokens, they can cash out in a few months,

49:18.200 --> 49:23.200
and the way that this actually works is they encourage their fundees

49:23.200 --> 49:26.200
to basically issue unregistered securities.

49:26.200 --> 49:30.200
Anderson Horowitz invested in a bunch of startups

49:30.200 --> 49:34.200
that all issued tokens, that all got dumped on retail,

49:34.200 --> 49:38.200
including Anderson Horowitz dumping a lot of them on retail.

49:38.200 --> 49:41.200
This is blatant securities fraud,

49:41.200 --> 49:44.200
but they didn't commit the securities fraud.

49:44.200 --> 49:47.200
It was just the companies they invested in.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.200
On the surface, Web 3 has this narrative,

49:49.200 --> 49:53.200
which is all about taking money out of the hands of the rich and the big tech

49:53.200 --> 49:55.200
and giving it back to the users.

49:55.200 --> 49:58.200
But A16Z is the exact same company that has funded

49:58.200 --> 50:02.200
some of the biggest Web 2 companies like Facebook and Twitter.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.200
I'm sure that there are many inside of these firms

50:04.200 --> 50:07.200
that really believe in the potential of Web 3

50:07.200 --> 50:11.200
or crypto or blockchains or whatever buzzword you want to use,

50:11.200 --> 50:15.200
but it becomes increasingly harder to see that as anything other than hyperoptimism

50:15.200 --> 50:18.200
or another word for it, delusion.

50:18.200 --> 50:21.200
There's this interview with Mark Andreessen, right,

50:21.200 --> 50:23.200
who's the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz,

50:23.200 --> 50:27.200
and he's on this podcast episode with an economist and blogger called Tyler Cohen,

50:27.200 --> 50:31.200
and he proposes the idea for podcasts to make use of Web 3.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.200
A well-known podcast host.

50:32.200 --> 50:36.200
How does that person get paid in a better way through Web 3.0?

50:36.200 --> 50:38.200
Make that more concrete for us.

50:38.200 --> 50:41.200
Now, Mark Andreessen is someone that, by all accounts,

50:41.200 --> 50:44.200
should have a good answer to this question.

50:44.200 --> 50:45.200
But instead...

50:45.200 --> 50:47.200
Yeah, I mean, they can pick their business model.

50:47.200 --> 50:49.200
I mean, they can pick their business model.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.200
They can decide, you know, the business model, you know, microtransactions.

50:52.200 --> 50:55.200
They can pick, you know, they can pick whatever model they want.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.200
You know, they can also have indirect, you know, there's this whole new rise

50:58.200 --> 51:00.200
of this kind of the non-fungible token.

51:00.200 --> 51:02.200
You know, when pressed to give an actual use case,

51:02.200 --> 51:06.200
what you get is an answer with all the right buzzwords and phrases,

51:06.200 --> 51:08.200
but little actual substance.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.200
I compare it to the Internet.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.200
Like, in all seriousness, I compare it to the Internet, which is the Internet, basically.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.200
It's 93 or so.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.200
Yeah, it's like 93, 94.

51:14.200 --> 51:18.200
This is the only time I've ever said this is like the Internet is this.

51:18.200 --> 51:23.200
A16Z uses the same narrative that a lot of crypto enthusiasts will also use.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.200
You may hate it, you may think it's a fad,

51:25.200 --> 51:28.200
but crypto and Web 3.0 are just like the Internet.

51:28.200 --> 51:32.200
Even I made this comparison when I looked at the entire space in a more favorable light.

51:32.200 --> 51:36.200
Now, though, I just think it's another form of smoke and mirrors.

51:36.200 --> 51:40.200
It is the biggest technology shift since the Internet, the blockchain,

51:40.200 --> 51:43.200
the consumer blockchains, the biggest new thing since the Internet itself.

51:43.200 --> 51:46.200
Bitcoin began in 2009.

51:46.200 --> 51:50.200
Arguably blockchain technology and the foundations for it began even earlier than that.

51:50.200 --> 51:54.200
It's been 13 years since this story began with Bitcoin.

51:54.200 --> 51:59.200
13 years to find a solid use case, or at least one that justifies the hype

51:59.200 --> 52:02.200
and is already better than an existing system.

52:02.200 --> 52:07.200
Crypto and Web 3 is really great at one thing, which is trading in speculation.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.200
And there is absolutely no democratization of anything.

52:10.200 --> 52:14.200
There's centralization of exchanges, centralization of miners,

52:14.200 --> 52:19.200
centralization of crypto wealth is the most concentrated amount of centralized wealth

52:19.200 --> 52:21.200
in the history of humanity.

52:22.200 --> 52:29.200
13 years after 1983, which is considered to be the birth of the Internet,

52:29.200 --> 52:32.200
we were already seeing very clear card use cases.

52:32.200 --> 52:35.200
Even in those early days, people could get weather reports,

52:35.200 --> 52:38.200
they could check the news, they could send emails and many other uses

52:38.200 --> 52:40.200
that we still use to this day.

52:40.200 --> 52:43.200
I sent a message to my doctor asking for a repeat prescription

52:43.200 --> 52:48.200
and he's left the prescription for me in the chemist.

52:48.200 --> 52:52.200
By even making the comparison to one of the biggest revolutions in information

52:52.200 --> 52:56.200
and communication is already assuming that cryptocurrencies are revolutionary

52:56.200 --> 52:59.200
and they're bound to find mass adoption at some point,

52:59.200 --> 53:02.200
when that is the very future we're putting into question.

53:04.200 --> 53:08.200
One recent post that I remember on the Bitcoin subreddit was titled

53:08.200 --> 53:12.200
Does anyone else feel like Bitcoin is their literal last-ditch effort

53:12.200 --> 53:14.200
to become wealthy in their lifetime?

53:14.200 --> 53:18.200
I don't imagine that this is the only person in the crypto space that is thinking that way.

53:18.200 --> 53:21.200
The crypto machine has continued running.

53:21.200 --> 53:25.200
New packaging of ideas, more money funneled into the system

53:25.200 --> 53:29.200
and a constant search to find a use case that justifies the hype

53:29.200 --> 53:31.200
and the claims of revolutionary technology.

53:31.200 --> 53:35.200
If the critics are right, then what we're looking at is a ticking time bomb.

53:35.200 --> 53:39.200
If the critics are right, then this is a scheme that will leave

53:39.200 --> 53:44.200
tons of regular individuals left holding their bags wondering how this managed to happen.

53:44.200 --> 53:49.200
It already has a scheme that managed to infiltrate the realm of media and entertainment

53:49.200 --> 53:53.200
that managed to make use of social media's ability to spread this fear of missing out.

53:53.200 --> 53:57.200
They're capitalized on greed and a get-rich-quick mentality.

53:57.200 --> 54:02.200
If the critics are right, then I suppose there's only one question that remains.

54:02.200 --> 54:05.200
At what point does the ticking time bomb go off?
