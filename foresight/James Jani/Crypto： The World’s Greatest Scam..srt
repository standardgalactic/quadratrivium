1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
What you're looking at, depending on who you ask, is either a revolution for the internet

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,000
and countless industries as we know it, or the greatest Ponzi scheme in human history.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,200
The whole thing is a promise that you can get rich for free.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,240
Accused of being all of these things is the world of cryptocurrencies, or the other labels

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,800
associated with it, NFTs, blockchains, Web 3.0, from the bizarre onslaught of celebrity

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:43,880
promotions and endorsements, to the eye-watering numbers and headlines, to the grandiose claims

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:52,040
about its potential, I once described the world of cryptocurrencies as a story, and

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,000
I did that in hopeful, optimistic tones.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:21,080
And now, now I don't think it's the story that I initially thought it was.

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,800
For me and many others, it began here.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,400
What you're looking at is a piece of artwork by a digital artist called Michael Joseph Winkleman,

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,960
otherwise known as Beeple.

13
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,680
On February the 25th of 2021, this artwork was put on auction.

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Bidding started at $100.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,400
It eventually sold for $69.3 million, making it one of the biggest sales in digital art

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
history.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:55,680
What happened afterwards?

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Where do I begin?

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,640
A digital artwork by a relatively unknown American artist, sold for nearly $70 million, that's

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
more than most Picasso's Monet's or Warhol's, that it doesn't exist in physical form, it

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,240
is only available digitally.

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,480
It's the first NFT ever sold at auction, non-fungible token, NFTs, or non-fungible token,

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,200
It was like suddenly the term NFT was just everywhere.

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,120
Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sells a picture of his first ever tweet as an NFT.

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,880
Jack Dorsey, auctioning his first tweet as digital art, $2.9 million.

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,600
Even popular internet memes were selling as this NFT thing, Nyan Cat, $590,000, Charlie

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,880
Bit My Finger, $760,999, Disaster Girl, $500,000, Doge, $4 million, Overly Attached Girlfriend,

28
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,400
$411,000, Bad Luck Brian, $36,000, Scumbag Steve, $57,000.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,040
You had singer-songwriter Grime selling $6 million worth of digital art as NFTs?

30
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,640
People were changing their profile pictures on social media to NFTs they had purchased.

31
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,720
It was like flexing an expensive car or a watch.

32
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,880
And then suddenly all these big celebrities and artists and influences were also replacing

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,720
their profile pictures with NFTs and announcing their own purchases of NFTs.

34
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
And the apes?

35
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,360
The apes were part of this bigger project of NFTs called Board Ape Yacht Club.

36
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,480
I mean, you had Snoop Dogg, Eminem, DJ Khaled, Lil Baby, Post Malone, Stephen Curry, Gwyneth

37
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,840
Paltrow, to name a few, all of them purchasing these pictures of apes for sometimes hundreds

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,160
of thousands of dollars.

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,040
And amongst this sea of high ticket sales, you would hear that this is all part of something

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
revolutionary.

41
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,440
It's the biggest technology that's ever happened in the history of life, outside of things

42
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
like fire.

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,760
Regardless of how much you knew about NFTs, there was one message that was really clear.

44
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,000
Behind every story, every headline, there was an underlying premise.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,880
Something is happening and there is a lot of money to be made.

46
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,320
Welcome back to the show and congrats on getting married.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
This is a big deal.

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,800
The last time you were on the show, I asked you to explain NFTs.

49
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,360
So popular talk show host Jimmy Fallon does this segment on his show with Paris Hilton

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,200
where they show off their pictures of Board Apes.

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
This is your apes?

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
We debuted.

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
That's really cool.

54
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
The hat, the shades.

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
We're part of the same community.

56
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
We're both apes.

57
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
Love it.

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
This is my apes.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
This is yours.

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Yours is so cool.

61
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I love the Red Heart sunglasses.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I love the Captain hat.

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
It reminded me of me a little bit.

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Look at this.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
They look like they could be friends.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
They're buddies.

67
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:43,200
This was the point in which I started to wonder, okay, what is actually happening?

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
And I think a lot of people started to as well.

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,200
You start to realize that the purchase of Beeple's artwork, that wasn't done through

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
$69.3 million in cash.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
That purchase was made using crypto currencies.

72
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,200
In fact, all the NFT purchases that we were seeing, they were done through cryptocurrency.

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,200
The mysterious individual who purchased Beeple's artwork that went by the pseudonym MetaCovid

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,200
turns out it's this guy called Vignesh Sundaresan who is already a cryptocurrency entrepreneur

75
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
and had a working relationship with Beeple months prior to the big sale.

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,200
And whilst there was all this talk about the revolutionary potential behind what we're

77
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,200
seeing, there was another side of the story that was being painted by people who are far

78
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
skeptical and those voices had a clear warning.

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,200
What you are witnessing is a mania.

80
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,200
We've got this system that is gleefully and gloriously corrupt.

81
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
A mania that is being driven by greed.

82
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Get rich quick by investing in crypto currency.

83
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Mass delusion.

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
My ape is an inner reflection of myself.

85
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Or, as other critics put it, it is a giant scam that has some of the largest names, brands,

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
venture capital firms backing it knowingly or not.

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,200
NFTs were just a component of a much bigger machine with a lot of moving pieces.

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,200
And when you put those pieces together, it creates a machine for one of the greatest scams in human history.

89
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:12,200
And it all begins here with a mysterious invention and a failed revolution.

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
2008.

91
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
That's where this really begins.

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Apple shares are just getting hammered this morning.

93
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,200
We're down by between three and four and a half percent, generally.

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
The United States is going through a recession it hasn't seen since the Great Depression.

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
The consumers strangle.

96
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
They're watching their housing prices go lower.

97
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
They're watching their 401Ks get diminished.

98
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
You created the mess we're in and now you're saying, sorry.

99
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Amongst the backdrop of this all, a mysterious individual is working on their own invention.

100
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,200
On the 31st of October, they send an email to a cryptography mailing list.

101
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
The email begins.

102
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,200
I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer with no trusted third party.

103
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
It was signed by somebody under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

104
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Whoever this Nakamoto person was, they had a vision.

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,200
The vision was to create a type of currency that existed digitally that could be controlled by no government or single individual

106
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,200
that could be used to transact in globally no matter where you were or what time it was.

107
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
The name of this currency and invention?

108
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Bitcoin.

109
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,200
On January the 3rd, 2009, Nakamoto launches his invention, creating the first ever Bitcoins to exist.

110
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,200
It was an attractive pitch, you know, especially to people who held anti-state control sentiments.

111
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,200
We're talking about anarchists, techno-anarchists, libertarians, cypher-punks.

112
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,200
These were individuals who likely saw the government, the banks, the entire financial institution as just untrustworthy.

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,200
That they can't be allowed to control monetary policy.

114
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,200
And it was these factions that became the first adopters of Bitcoin influencing its early culture.

115
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
The goal was simple.

116
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Preach the message of Bitcoin to others and increase its adoption.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Bitcoin was kind of like a religion of its own, right?

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Like Satoshi Nakamoto was this Jesus-like figure that would communicate with his disciples on online forums.

119
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,200
We would talk of this future vision of the world, you know, one where the dollar no longer existed

120
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,200
and all transactions would be made through Bitcoin, the global currency of the people that was owned by no central entity.

121
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,200
To those early adopters of Bitcoin, they really felt like they were on the cusp of something revolutionary.

122
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,200
It just so happened that the more people started buying into the message, the higher Bitcoin's value rose

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
and the more people were willing to like put real dollars into buying Bitcoins.

124
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Bitcoin is now up to $111.

125
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Bitcoin started drawing attention from places it probably wasn't expecting or even wanting.

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,200
The guys in suits, you know, the big money, the people who saw Bitcoin as revolutionary

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
but perhaps more importantly as an opportunity.

128
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
The Winklevoss twins were a perfect example of that.

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
I mean, here you have two twins who have graduated from Harvard.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,200
They've won a settlement for $65 million against Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their initial idea of Facebook.

131
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,200
They found out about Bitcoin on a holiday trip to Ibiza and they started buying as much as they could.

132
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
They were stockpiling the currency.

133
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,200
It was by around 2013 that they were rumored to own about 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation.

134
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,200
That, I think, was a perfect early warning of what was to come.

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Bitcoin was doomed from the start.

136
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
That's what a lot of crypto skeptics will tell you and I understand why.

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Relying on computer code and the ideals of tech anarchists probably isn't the best place to entrust a reimagining of the financial system.

138
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Bitcoin had a fixed supply of 21 million coins which makes it deflationary by nature.

139
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,200
So if one Bitcoin is worth more tomorrow than it is today, why would you want to use it to transact with?

140
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,200
It's a pretty bad incentive to have if you're trying to make a global currency.

141
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,200
But that is already assuming that Bitcoin had the technical capabilities to become this worldwide currency,

142
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
which it didn't.

143
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Bitcoin had scaling issues thanks to design decisions that Nakamoto themselves had made.

144
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,200
It could only process 7 transactions per second compared to other traditional payment networks like Visa,

145
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,200
which can process 1700 transactions per second, or Mastercard, which handles 5000 transactions per second,

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,200
and keeping the Bitcoin network running wasted a lot of energy.

147
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Bitcoin aimed to be decentralized, meaning no government or single entity had control over it.

148
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,200
In order to do that, Nakamoto employed what is called a proof-of-work consensus model.

149
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,200
All this meant was that computers on the Bitcoin network would be forced to use real-world energy in order to solve algorithmic problems,

150
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
and whichever computers solved the problem first would be rewarded with more Bitcoins.

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,200
It was a process called mining, and that process is insanely wasteful of energy.

152
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
And what ends up happening?

153
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Proof-of-work incentivized this arms race between computers on the Bitcoin network,

154
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,200
all of them looking to build more and more powerful computers to have a better chance of mining Bitcoin.

155
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
And the more powerful those computers grew, the more real-world energy they ended up taking,

156
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
despite the fact that the transactions per second remained the same.

157
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Most Bitcoin mining done today is done by huge mining farms in warehouses.

158
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Bitcoin, for the most part, failed in its objective of trying to become a global currency.

159
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Outside of illegal use purposes, Bitcoin just wasn't being used to transact with.

160
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
So the obvious question becomes how?

161
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,200
How is it that despite its failings, Bitcoin still survived and is very much present to this day?

162
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
But that's just the thing.

163
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
The Bitcoin that we see today is a shell of its former identity,

164
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,200
where most of the purchasing of Bitcoin today happens on centralized exchanges

165
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
that have to comply with the laws of centralized institutions.

166
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,200
In the instances where you've heard about Bitcoin, or if you've ever been encouraged to buy Bitcoin,

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
under what context is that always framed?

168
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,200
By 2014, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto effectively vanished from the Internet and hasn't been heard from since.

169
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,200
What was left of his invention was no longer a currency, it was something entirely different.

170
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Bernie Madoff.

171
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
This was a guy who was well respected on Wall Street.

172
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
He ran a brokerage firm with a wealth management branch.

173
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,200
He had many clients investing with his firm under the promise of great returns on their money until...

174
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:24,200
The FBI arrested him this morning after he told senior employees yesterday that his business was a giant Ponzi scheme.

175
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Madoff had been running the largest Ponzi scheme in history for the last 17 years and potentially longer,

176
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,200
worth around $64.8 billion.

177
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,200
He would essentially put his investors' money inside a bank account and then simply pay out early investors

178
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
with the money that new investors were giving.

179
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Now Madoff eventually pleaded guilty and he was imprisoned up until his death in 2021.

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
That is the essence of any Ponzi scheme.

181
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,200
People invest into the scheme under this promise that they're going to make a great amount of returns

182
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
and then early investors are paid using the money of new investors.

183
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,200
And this process is repeated on and on until eventually you run out of new recruits to keep investing money into the scheme

184
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,200
or eventually people start trying to cash out and it just collapses,

185
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,200
which tends to leave early investors with profits and the large majority of others with nothing but losses.

186
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
People hearing about Bitcoin would hear about two things.

187
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,200
One, that it was revolutionary and two, that it was a valuable.

188
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,200
That if you buy now, you could be rich later.

189
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:33,200
If you really, really want to become wealthy in the future, I suggest you take one fricking dollar, buy some Bitcoin.

190
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Bitcoin to me, it's not just an investment.

191
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,200
It's not just a maybe a get rich quick scheme as a lot of people put it, but I see it as the future of currency.

192
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I see it as the future of the financial system.

193
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,200
So you realize that most of the people buying Bitcoin, they're not buying it to use as a currency.

194
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,200
They're buying it as an investment and therein lies the contradiction.

195
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Because the more people who used Bitcoin like an investment, the less liable Bitcoin became as a currency,

196
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,200
the very thing it's being pitched as being revolutionary as.

197
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
So you know what you end up with, right?

198
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme.

199
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,200
The promise is you can get rich for free, magical internet money.

200
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Anyone who buys into the idea of Bitcoin is doing so to sell it for a higher price at a future date

201
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,200
and the people that buy it off those people are also looking to sell it for a higher price at a future date.

202
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,200
The only way to make money from your Bitcoin investment is using the money of new investors.

203
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
You hear about people making money in Bitcoin.

204
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,200
They only make money because some other sucker lost more.

205
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,200
And unlike Bernie Madoff, right, who gets all the blame and the satisfying jail time at the end of his story,

206
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,200
here you have an entity that isn't owned by anyone or some would argue isn't a decentralized currency.

207
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
It's a decentralized Ponzi scheme.

208
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Now Ponzi schemes are kept alive by continuously finding new recruits and new markets to tap into

209
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
so that money is continuously being poured into the scheme.

210
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,200
And so you start to see this similar incentive develop in the crypto space.

211
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
This desperate need to find a use case for this stuff.

212
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,200
And that use case has to be revolutionary enough to justify its rising value.

213
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Bitcoin may have been the first part of this machine, but things were about to get a whole lot more interesting.

214
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Bitcoin had something going for it.

215
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,200
The blockchain system that kept it running was somewhat unique.

216
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Okay, so let's not complicate things, right?

217
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,200
You can think of Bitcoin like a digital spreadsheet that records transactions being used in the currency.

218
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
It's not a physical coin. It's just data on a database.

219
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:40,200
After a certain number of transactions are made, a brand new spreadsheet is created that links to the previous one and on and on and on it goes.

220
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Instead of using real names, users are recognized through what are called wallet addresses,

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
which appear as a random string of numbers and letters.

222
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,200
And all of this is kind of kept together using computer code, cryptography, and the network of miners that are running it,

223
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
which is where the word cryptocurrency comes from.

224
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,200
So what was essentially just an immutable, append-only database was touted as revolutionary.

225
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
You know, blockchain was no longer just blockchain, it was blockchain technology.

226
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,200
And it wasn't long before people started to see the success and the ideals that Bitcoin was based off

227
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,200
and begin creating their own cryptocurrencies using this blockchain system.

228
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Vitalik Buterin, a teenager who decided to quit his favorite video game at World of Warcraft

229
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,200
after his Warlock character had a damaged component removed by the game developers.

230
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Vitalik says that he cried himself to sleep that night.

231
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,200
That was the day that he realized the horrors that centralized services bring.

232
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,200
It sounds a bit ridiculous, but Vitalik would end up discovering Bitcoin in 2011

233
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
and he would start writing for a Bitcoin magazine.

234
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
It all appealed to his ideals.

235
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:54,200
In 2015, Vitalik and several other co-founders launched the creation of their own blockchain-based invention.

236
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
It was called Ethereum.

237
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum had its own blockchain and it had its own native currency, which was called Ether.

238
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
There was one important difference, though.

239
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,200
You see, Ethereum allowed its users to actually program applications on its blockchain.

240
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Put it this way, if Bitcoin was like a spreadsheet, then Ethereum was like an Excel spreadsheet

241
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,200
that allowed users to create functions to perform various different tasks.

242
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
It was, you know, a little more advanced.

243
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,200
It was a glimpse of hope at finding the revolutionary use cases the cryptocurrency world needed

244
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
in order to justify the growing value that was being pumped into the system.

245
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,200
So, what was the first thing that people started using Ethereum for?

246
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Creating more cryptocurrencies.

247
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,200
And today we will be creating our own cryptocurrency in under 10 or maybe even under 5 minutes.

248
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Rather than needing to create your own blockchain and network, you could just use Ethereum's blockchain

249
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,200
to create your own cryptocurrencies or crypto assets, as people called them.

250
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,200
These assets that existed without their own native blockchain were called tokens.

251
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
There are now over 1500 cryptocurrencies.

252
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,200
It became known as the ICO mania.

253
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
It was supposed to be this new way to fund your business.

254
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Businesses could create their own token coins, release what is called a whitepaper,

255
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,200
which explains what the project aimed to do, and then they could sell those tokens to the public.

256
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Otherwise known as an initial coin offering, ICO.

257
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,200
A whole wave of these token coins were being released.

258
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Some of them parodies and others were just blatant scams.

259
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
It's coin.

260
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
The Whopper coin.

261
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Trump coin.

262
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Kodak coin.

263
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Insane coin.

264
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
But here it is.

265
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
I created a dictator coin.

266
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Jesus coin was a token coin that was promising to decentralize Jesus on the blockchain.

267
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
On its whitepaper, its creators stated,

268
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,200
they were in early talks with churches to provide miracles exclusively to Jesus coin owners.

269
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Ponzi coin was very much open about the fact that it was a scam.

270
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Their website literally said it right there.

271
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,200
It's as much as a scam as 99% of the ICOs out there, but it's more transparent about it.

272
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Ponzi coin still managed to raise $250,000.

273
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
It didn't matter if the idea was good enough or not,

274
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
or if it even solved the problems it was claiming to solve.

275
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
All that mattered was that people believed in the token enough

276
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,200
so that the value would rise and it would pay off the early investors who got in at the start.

277
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
There was one that you invested in that saw like 2,000% growth last month.

278
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Yep.

279
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
What was it?

280
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
That was Dabber coin.

281
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,200
It also marked the beginning of an unlikely friendship between those in the cryptocurrency space

282
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
and influencers and celebrities.

283
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
If token coins were fueled by hype and attention,

284
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,200
then celebrities and influencers were the ones that were running the gas stations.

285
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Famous professional boxer Floyd Mayweather along with producer DJ Khaled

286
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,200
were paid $100,000 and $50,000 respectively to promote the token coin Centratec in 2017.

287
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Centratec was a project that was promising to deliver financial services to the cryptocurrency world.

288
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
The coin had raised $32 million.

289
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Turns out they lied about their CEO who wasn't even a real person that existed.

290
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
They lied about business deals with Mastercard and Visa

291
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
and its co-founder Sam Sharma was eventually sentenced to eight years in prison.

292
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,200
ICOs effectively became a casino to gamble unregistered securities,

293
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
but you have to remember the hidden incentives.

294
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,200
No matter how fraudulent or bizarre everything looks on the outside in the crypto world,

295
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,200
you have to keep clushing at potential use cases

296
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,200
or anything that will justify its value constantly rising to new investors.

297
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
And whilst the ICO mania of 2017 was continuing,

298
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
a whole new idea was coming to fruition.

299
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
So how many of y'all have heard of this new game that came out recently?

300
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
I don't know how do we actually describe what these things are.

301
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
And today we're talking about crypto kitties.

302
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Crypto kitties was probably one of the first NFT projects to make it into the spotlight.

303
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Crypto kitties.

304
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Crypto kitties.

305
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,200
The viral blockchain-based game that sparked a global craze for virtual cats.

306
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
It's a picture of a cat.

307
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
You logged onto the site, you created an account that was connected to your crypto wallet,

308
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,200
and you'd play this game in which you would collect, breed and sell virtual cats for cryptocurrency.

309
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,200
The key pitch here though is that every cat is its own unique token that exists on the Ethereum blockchain,

310
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
making them what you would essentially call a non-fungible,

311
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
or as they're often called now, a non-fungible token, an NFT.

312
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Think of it like a digital beanie babies.

313
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Now if that sounds a little weird, it's because it is.

314
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Crypto kitties became like its own mania.

315
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,200
It generated $3 million within its first week of launch

316
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
and accounted for roughly 10 to 13% of all traffic on Ethereum's network.

317
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
And where was everyone's focus during that mania?

318
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Okay, that's $2,700 for this little guy.

319
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Why use these crypto kitties?

320
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,200
$450,000 for this ugly mug.

321
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
The same reason you started out with the cryptocurrency.

322
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
To make money.

323
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Guys, this is a potential way to make some money.

324
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
This is insane.

325
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Most users are trying to breed their cats at the moment,

326
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
not just because it's kind of cool, but also because they can be very expensive.

327
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
There are thousands of people playing on the Crypto Kitties website.

328
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Once everyone started rushing to join in on the hype,

329
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
the economics of the game began to falter

330
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
as the supply of crypto kitties stretched far beyond the demand,

331
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
eventually leading to a crash in the price of crypto kitties

332
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
and a fall in average users.

333
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Because as you continue to see time and time again,

334
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
almost everyone was there to make money.

335
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,200
But what remained of that saga was the idea of non-fungible assets.

336
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
A brand new package, a brand new pitch,

337
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,200
a new route to find use cases for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

338
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,200
This stuff was initially pitched to digital artists.

339
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
The idea was that you would make artwork,

340
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
then tokenize that artwork,

341
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,200
which just means turning it into a token that exists on a blockchain like Ethereum.

342
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
If you wanted to know who owned the artwork,

343
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,200
all you had to do was just go and check the blockchain records

344
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
and see which wallet was associated with the artwork.

345
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
In theory, you could digitally verify the ownership of your art.

346
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Sounds exciting.

347
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
You might think.

348
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
I did too.

349
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Digital artist Michael Winkleman, otherwise known as Beeple,

350
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
began a challenge in 2007 where he would create one piece of artwork

351
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,200
every single day and continue to do so throughout the years.

352
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
It was known as his every day's collection.

353
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
But to me, the bigger project is this long-term every day's project,

354
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,200
which is a project that I've been working on, you know,

355
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
every single day for over 12 years.

356
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,200
It was reportedly around October of 2020

357
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,200
when Beeple was put in touch with an anonymous NFT artist called Pak

358
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,200
and Pak informed Beeple about the world of NFTs.

359
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Only a few months later,

360
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
he would end up auctioning a piece of artwork

361
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,200
that contained a collage of the first 5,000 images of the Every Day series,

362
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
titled Every Day's The First 5,000 Days.

363
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,200
$69.3 million was how much it sold for in the Ether cryptocurrency,

364
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
one of the largest sales in digital art history.

365
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
The very sale that sent the search term NFT skyrocketing.

366
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
So now the question becomes,

367
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
who decided to make that purchase?

368
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,200
So you purchased a collection of 5,000 pieces of digital art

369
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
that anyone can easily see online for $69 million.

370
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Why did you do that?

371
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,200
MetaCoven, or as they were later revealed to be Vignesh Sundaresan,

372
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,200
a crypto entrepreneur who had recently co-founded

373
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,200
a crypto investment firm with his business partner called Metapurse.

374
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Only a few months before this big $69 million purchase,

375
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
MetaCoven and his business partner

376
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,200
had already bought another collection of NFTs from Beeple

377
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
for over $2.2 million.

378
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
They actually wrote a blog post about their purchase,

379
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
alluding to the fact that this was only part of a much bigger project

380
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
that they had in mind that will quote,

381
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
flip the art world status quo on its head.

382
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
And what was that project that they were talking about?

383
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
The B20 token coin.

384
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,200
They were going to bundle their purchases of Beeple's NFT's collection

385
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,200
and put it in a virtual museum where those who purchased the B20 token coin

386
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
could access and view the artwork.

387
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Owning the B20 token was supposed to represent a type of fractional ownership

388
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,200
in the virtual museum and the contents inside of it.

389
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Here's the thing,

390
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,200
MetaCoven and his business partner conveniently owned

391
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,200
59% of the total supply of B20 tokens.

392
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Beeple was also given 2% of that supply.

393
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Beeple and MetaCoven already had a working relationship

394
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
before the big every day's 5,000 sale.

395
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
When that sale happened and the media frenzy ensued,

396
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,200
the B20 token rose in value to $23

397
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,200
as more people began obviously looking into who MetaCoven was.

398
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
People have accused that sale of essentially being

399
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,200
a giant marketing stunt to increase the value of the B20 token.

400
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Even in their calls together,

401
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,200
you can hear Beeple express skepticism around the whole thing

402
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,200
only for MetaCoven and the others to kind of bring him around.

403
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Other artists I can almost guarantee will not like this.

404
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Like they will not like you taking their work

405
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
and like splitting it into a million pieces

406
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
and reselling those pieces.

407
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
That I would be very surprised if other artists

408
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,200
did not have a very strong dislike of that.

409
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,200
But what I find the most insane about this saga

410
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
was that the B20 virtual museum

411
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
that was supposed to flip the art world status quo

412
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
was nothing impressive.

413
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
The B20 token has fallen over 99% in value

414
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
since its all time high.

415
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Despite all of this, MetaCoven's sales

416
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
sent headlines skyrocketing.

417
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Suddenly NFTs were being created out of internet memes

418
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
or anything really that was culturally relevant to the internet.

419
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
From the outside, all you had to know

420
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
were that NFTs were revolutionary

421
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
and there was a lot of money involved.

422
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
You didn't even have to know that they were intrinsically tied

423
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
to the world of cryptocurrencies or blockchain.

424
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
A successful repackaging.

425
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Once the sale of memes and other one-off NFT sales cooled down,

426
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
it became more popular to start buying into NFT projects.

427
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
These contained up to thousands of NFTs inside of them,

428
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
usually following a certain theme or concept.

429
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
What are crypto punks?

430
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
These are the crypto punks.

431
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
They are 25 by 25 pixels.

432
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
They're icons of zombies.

433
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
There's aliens, zombies, and they all have different mohawks

434
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
and glasses and beard types.

435
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,200
What is Cool Cat? The coolest NFTs on the blockchain?

436
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Shoot, I got a lazy lion's NFT

437
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
thinking about joining this amazing community.

438
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Clone X. This project is previously known as Akira.

439
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Sneaky Vampire Syndicate.

440
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
They've got Pudgy Penguins on the chopping block today.

441
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Just as it had been with Bitcoin and Token Coins,

442
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,200
the name of the game was about hyping up projects

443
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
that you can sell it for profit later.

444
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,200
NFTs, though, were cooler than your average Token Coins,

445
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
so they had art behind them.

446
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,200
You could show them off by replacing your social media profile picture

447
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
with an NFT you purchased.

448
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
More so than ever, hype and attention became an important part

449
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
of growing the value of an NFT,

450
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
which brings us to the apes.

451
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
One of the most significant projects created after Beeple's sale

452
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
was the Board Ape Yacht Club,

453
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
otherwise shortened to just Basie.

454
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Founded by the company Yuga Labs,

455
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,200
the project featured 10,000 different pictures of apes

456
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
with this distinct board expression on their face.

457
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
The Board Ape Yacht Club project had managed to arrive

458
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
into the NFT space at just the right time,

459
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
about a month after Beeple's big sale.

460
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,200
There were a few popular people inside of the NFT space,

461
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,200
already one of which went by the name of Jimmy McNeil

462
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,200
otherwise known as JimmyEath on Twitter,

463
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,200
who shortly after finding out about the project,

464
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,200
announces their purchase of hundreds of Board Ape NFTs.

465
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Then another popular figure in the NFT space, Pranksy,

466
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
who had around 50,000 followers at the time,

467
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
tweets their own purchase of 250 Board Apes,

468
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
which later grows to 1,250.

469
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,200
And all the time these guys are tweeting about their purchases

470
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
to their followers, it starts to create this buzz inside of the crypto space.

471
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,200
You've probably seen all over Twitter this crazy, crazy thing with apes.

472
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Just after 12 hours of its official launch,

473
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
the Basie Collection sold out,

474
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,200
giving Yuga Labs an estimated $2.8 million in revenue.

475
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Pranksy starts selling some of his apes to NBA players

476
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,200
who start tweeting and changing their profile pictures to those apes.

477
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
In August, the popular DJ, Steve Aoki,

478
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,200
tweets his own $40,000 purchase of a Board Ape

479
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
to his millions of followers.

480
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Tag Ape, follow Ape, began trending immediately.

481
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Famous digital artist Meeple tweeting about it

482
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
and creating an artwork about it,

483
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
which continued to drive up the price of Board Apes.

484
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
You ape, me ape, a friend.

485
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
One of the shadiest parts about everything that followed

486
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
were the blurred lines between celebrities and influencers

487
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,200
clearly manipulating a market to pump up the value of their NFTs

488
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
and genuine posts simply just showing off their purchases.

489
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
You had Justin Bieber in January of this year

490
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
posting a picture of a Board Ape number 3001

491
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,200
to his 251 million followers,

492
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,200
a purchase that was reportedly worth $1.3 million.

493
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Everyone sort of assumes that Justin

494
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
was the one that made the purchase himself, right?

495
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
And he's just posting it on his Instagram.

496
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,200
But then Twitter users started to look into the records

497
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
and they find that Justin's supposed crypto wallet

498
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,200
had received 900 ether from another wallet address.

499
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
And that wallet address was associated

500
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,200
with an individual named Jean Piero di Alessandro

501
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
or, as many others may recognize him,

502
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Justin Bieber's business partner.

503
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
And Jean Piero owned his own NFT collection called Inbetweeners

504
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
which Bieber had been promoting on social media already.

505
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
In those posts, no disclaimer was made suggesting

506
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
that Bieber had been paid to promote them.

507
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
I just got my first NFT.

508
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
You did? What was it?

509
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I threw MoonPay.

510
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,200
In some of the announcements from celebrities about their NFT purchases

511
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,200
there was this constant reference to a company called MoonPay,

512
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
thanking them for help with purchasing their NFTs.

513
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I got an Ape too because I saw you on the show with people

514
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
and you said you got a MoonPay.

515
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Turns out MoonPay was a company that was launched in 2019

516
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
which according to their website had one singular aim,

517
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
to increase cryptocurrency adoption.

518
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
So that begs the question,

519
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
what is the relationship between MoonPay

520
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
and the supposed celebrities and influences

521
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
they're helping by NFTs?

522
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
We'll talk, not once, not twice.

523
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,200
So we targets have an offer to support a true MoonPay.

524
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,200
At the end of the NDAs they try to send my each agency to, you know,

525
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,200
they want you to not disclose that they had purchased the NFT.

526
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Isn't it a little shady that you have the CEO of MoonPay,

527
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
a guy called Ivan Soto Wright,

528
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,200
who is an active participant in the NFT market,

529
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
who is clearly well connected to the celebrities

530
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
using his company's service,

531
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
who has access to insider information

532
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
and likely knows when celebrities may purchase an NFT

533
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
before they do it.

534
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,200
And surprise, surprise, people started finding out

535
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
that Wright on numerous occasions has purchased NFT projects

536
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
right before celebrities end up purchasing them.

537
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Prominent cryptoskeptic and author David Gerrard

538
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
had this post on his blog.

539
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
It was titled CryptoGrifters Try to Scam Artists Again.

540
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
He wrote,

541
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Tell artists there's a gusher of free money.

542
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
NFTs are the future.

543
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
If you want to get an NFTs,

544
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,200
you're guaranteed to make some money because it's new, it's fresh.

545
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Two, they need to buy into crypto to get the gusher of free money.

546
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Three, they become crypto advocates

547
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
and make excuses for proof of work and so on.

548
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Four, a few artists really are making life-changing money from this.

549
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Five, you probably won't be one of them.

550
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,200
It's sold to you as this amazing thing

551
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
where art is digitally verified on the blockchain.

552
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
And that pitch makes you think that on the blockchain,

553
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
when you purchase an NFT,

554
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,200
there's literally an entry that shows your wallet

555
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,200
and the actual image of the NFT you purchased right there.

556
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,200
You want to know what is actually the case with most NFTs?

557
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,200
There is no picture attached to the transaction.

558
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Instead, it's usually a HTTPS or IPFS link

559
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
containing the stored NFT image.

560
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,200
So what you're purchasing with most NFTs

561
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
is just an entry in a database that contains a link to the image

562
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,200
that anyone else can also access.

563
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
A little misleading to call that ownership.

564
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
But I guess at the end of the day,

565
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,200
that doesn't matter when, just like ICOs,

566
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
NFTs were just another speculative financial investment

567
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
to throw your money into.

568
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,200
And to do that, you had to buy into cryptocurrencies.

569
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,200
More money funneled into the machine.

570
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,200
In my experience of looking into crypto communities

571
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
and its culture and various projects,

572
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
there is this game that is being played.

573
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Some are blatant about it and others less so.

574
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
But the game is this.

575
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Everyone is playing a role in promoting their project,

576
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,200
calling it revolutionary, saying that this isn't like the others,

577
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,200
but ultimately, everyone knows that at some point,

578
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
they're going to sell.

579
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
And perhaps it is because of the greater full nature

580
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
of the crypto ecosystem,

581
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,200
where everyone is incentivized to keep putting money into the system

582
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,200
and to keep pushing it while simultaneously dismissing criticism.

583
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,200
On the surface, everything is supposed to be positive

584
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
and optimistic.

585
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,200
You have catchphrases and actions that are commonly used

586
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
in cryptocurrency communities.

587
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
HODL, short for hold on for dear life,

588
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
which refers to holding onto your crypto assets no matter what.

589
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
HODLing is seen as a good thing.

590
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Today, we're going to be talking about the art of the hole.

591
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
HODL again, HODL again, HODL again.

592
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Wagameet, short for we're all going to make it,

593
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
which is used as both a greeting

594
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
and an easy catchphrase to keep morale high.

595
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
We're all going to make it, and I say this,

596
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
with passion and confidence.

597
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,200
If you leave the market, if you give up, you will lose.

598
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
That is the ultimate failure.

599
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,200
We're still early is a sentiment often echoed in crypto communities

600
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,200
and encouraging message for those who are both new and old in the space,

601
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,200
letting them know that they haven't missed out on the opportunity

602
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
and further riches are on the horizon.

603
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Don't abandon hope.

604
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Is it too late to get into crypto?

605
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
No, never.

606
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
It's never too late.

607
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
It's actually too early.

608
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
It's extremely early still.

609
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Those who hold onto their crypto assets,

610
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
even when there is really good reason to sell,

611
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
are called diamond hands.

612
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Diamond hands is actually a requirement.

613
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Keep diamond handing, OK?

614
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
A positive trait that is encouraged,

615
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,200
whereas those who do sell are labeled paper hands.

616
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
A negative trait which is actively discouraged.

617
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,200
The worst part about paper-handed investors

618
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,200
is that it influences other people to grow paper on their hands.

619
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Most crypto communities are encouraged to say good morning

620
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
and good night to each other every day,

621
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
and listen to just a GM and GN,

622
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,200
kind of like a regular check-in and check-out with members.

623
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Negativity is usually handled in the same way,

624
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,200
since one group's negativity can actually devalue a project

625
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
and affect everyone else's ability to make money.

626
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
If there's some bad news about a particular cryptocurrency project

627
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
or cryptocurrencies in general,

628
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
it can be dismissed as fud,

629
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
an abbreviation for fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

630
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,200
We have someone that, again, is trying to spread fud.

631
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,200
They just couldn't sit idly by and let people fud my investment

632
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
and fud the leader of my investment.

633
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Or those who criticize are told,

634
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,200
you simply don't understand without any further elaboration.

635
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Or they're told to have fun staying poor,

636
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,200
which is a not-so-subtle nod to people's true intentions within the space.

637
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Or criticism is actually spun into a good thing for the project.

638
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,200
These are all very convenient actions to encourage

639
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
when keeping someone engaged and hopeful in a crypto project

640
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
is financially beneficial to everyone else.

641
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,200
I'm actually struck by how much the general public really hates it

642
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,200
when someone gets into NFTs and they just have an absolute adverse reaction.

643
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
I see this across industries.

644
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
The NFT mania did something.

645
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,200
I think it grew so big and so in-your-face from influencers and celebrities

646
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,200
that it started making people mad.

647
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
I'm so proud. I'm loving part of this community

648
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,200
and being a voice and sharing my platform and just getting the word out there.

649
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
What community? What are you guys talking about?

650
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
You don't fucking care about this.

651
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
I hate that they try to put on that they care about this.

652
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Board a yacht club NFTs, which I think are ugly, dumb, cringe.

653
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Thank you guys for allowing me to scream about NFT cartoons.

654
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I hate this stuff. It's getting worse.

655
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Check this out. I got a board bunny.

656
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,200
And not only is it a board bunny, but it looks like me. Look at that.

657
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Nothing makes people hate you faster than NFT shilling.

658
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,200
If you're young and naive, just like my brother and want to get into NFTs,

659
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
you should check out Board Bunny.

660
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,200
The new Board Bunny NFT project has now been classified as a scam.

661
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,200
I welcome David Doberk to the long list of influencers promoting scams.

662
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Further claiming the team has disappeared with $6 million.

663
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,200
It's great to be a part of this project. I love the designs inspired by Pokemon.

664
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,200
It's a Pokemon knockoff. It's just like stealing money from people who are fans of Pokemon.

665
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Y'all better not miss this.

666
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,200
They promised Pokemon partnerships and it was all a lie

667
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,200
and it ended up raking in $6.3 million.

668
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,200
For the last six months, I've been working on my own NFT project.

669
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
The project is called CryptoZoo.

670
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
I believe it's going to change the game.

671
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
CryptoZoo, Logan Paul's newest project,

672
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,200
are basically a bunch of stock photos from Adobe that have been poorly photoshopped.

673
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Unfungible tokens. Yes, I do know what they are, but I don't really like them at all really.

674
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I'm not really into them.

675
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Nobody seems to like NFTs.

676
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,200
We didn't find anybody who actually had anything positive to say about them.

677
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Whenever a big celebrity or influencer would post something related to NFTs on their social media,

678
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,200
you'd see a whole slew of people responding with,

679
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
oh no, not you too.

680
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
And this wasn't just limited to individuals either.

681
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Companies began getting a lot of flak for even talking about or dabbling into NFTs.

682
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,200
In 2021, people found out what cryptocurrency actually was and they hated.

683
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,200
It is all get rich quick schemes promoted using technology as the cover.

684
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
All of it.

685
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
That's what crypto is.

686
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
And NFT is the latest species.

687
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I think in June of 1500, computer scientists and technologists directed Congress

688
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,200
calling for more responsible regulation of crypto assets.

689
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,200
They said the catastrophes and externalities related to blockchain technologies

690
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
and crypto asset investments are the inevitable outcomes of a technology

691
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,200
that is not built for purpose and will remain forever unsuitable

692
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,200
as a foundation for large scale economic activity.

693
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,200
And so you start to wonder, okay, what's going to happen?

694
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
And I know that it really shouldn't surprise me,

695
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,200
but a whole new packaging had been in the works and a brand new word was taking the stage.

696
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Our mission at MoonPay is to onboard the world to Web 3.

697
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,200
I have to admit, it's a pretty convincing narrative.

698
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,200
The first iteration of the Internet, Web 1.0,

699
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,200
was essentially the first version of the web mostly consisting of web pages and information.

700
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
There wasn't much you could actually interact with.

701
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Then came along Web 2.0, which brought access to many new features.

702
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,200
It focused on user generated content, social media and more forms of participation.

703
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
This version of the Internet became dominated by large corporations.

704
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Web 2.0 is our current modern day version of the Internet.

705
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,200
But now Web 3.0 is coming.

706
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,200
It kind of just referred to a bunch of different things,

707
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,200
but the idea was that a new version of the Internet is here,

708
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,200
where your online activity was going to be making use of blockchains and tokens to some degree or another.

709
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,200
So in theory, the now centralized version of the Internet owned by Big Tech

710
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
would become owned now by its users.

711
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,200
In its initial bubble, NFTs were seen as just digital art, right, which is quite limiting.

712
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,200
At the end of the day, NFTs are just data on a public database

713
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
that can act as a receipt of ownership over whatever that data contained.

714
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,200
You know, whether it was a coin or it was a web link to a digital piece of art.

715
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,200
The idea was that if NFTs could prove ownership over something,

716
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
then you could put anything on the blockchain.

717
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Real estate titles, medical records, university degrees, legal records.

718
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,200
In the case of Web 3.0, you'd have social media sites and video games,

719
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,200
all incorporating blockchain and NFTs into their business model.

720
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,200
It didn't really matter what it was or how it would work exactly.

721
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,200
It just became this game of insert anything here, but on the blockchain.

722
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
And just like that, you've made it revolutionary.

723
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,200
You've just recreated the entire mortgage infrastructure that already exists today.

724
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
On the blockchain.

725
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Exactly.

726
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,200
The blockchain in real estate is going to be pretty mainstream five to ten years from now.

727
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,200
These solar grids, electric grids, self-driving car grids,

728
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
that will essentially be machine run and controlled and administered by blockchains.

729
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,200
The best use case for blockchain is healthcare.

730
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
What can and can't be turned into an NFT?

731
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Ultimately, what we're talking about is the tokenization of everything.

732
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,200
Never mind if blockchains or tokenization actually fixed the issues

733
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
that it was claiming to solve in these industries.

734
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,200
It was literally the definition of a solution in search of a problem.

735
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I'm lost as to why the on the blockchain part matters,

736
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
besides basically what everyone means is they mean,

737
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,200
oh, I want a public record of the transaction.

738
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Okay.

739
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,200
I mean, people suggested that you could replace legal contracts with smart contracts,

740
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
which are programs that are built on the blockchain.

741
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
And that's usually accompanied with the phrase code is law.

742
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
This is a smart contract.

743
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
And this is a legal contract.

744
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
These two things aren't the same, right?

745
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,200
You can't have law be enacted by a computer code

746
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,200
because law inherently requires third parties to assess evidence, intentions,

747
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,200
and a bunch of other variables that you just can't outsource that to computer code,

748
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,200
especially when that code is on the blockchain and it cannot be altered.

749
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Nicholas Weaver, a researcher and lecturer at UC Berkeley's Department for Computer Science,

750
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
has this interview with Current Affairs,

751
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,200
and he brought up what he called Weaver's Iron Law of blockchain.

752
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
When somebody says you can solve X with blockchain,

753
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,200
they don't understand X and you can just ignore them.

754
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
So you start to wonder, right?

755
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Who is behind all of this money that's coming and pouring into the crypto and Web 3 space?

756
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Where is it coming from and why?

757
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Either I'm not seeing the revolutionary potential that all of this has,

758
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,200
or this genuinely is a massive mania and bubble that is being fueled by greed and delusion.

759
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,200
The so-called next version of the internet that's attracting big money from venture capital.

760
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Venture firm called Andreessen Horowitz, have you guys heard of it?

761
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,200
I kept seeing this venture capital name pop up.

762
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
We've been in the space for a long time.

763
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Kind of a big deal, running the crypto fund with more than 7 billion in capital to deploy.

764
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,200
Andreessen Horowitz, otherwise known as A16Z,

765
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
they're one of the largest venture capital firms.

766
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,200
They have a crypto fund with around 7.6 billion to be invested in crypto and Web 3 startups,

767
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,200
and have been investing in crypto companies dating back to 2013.

768
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,200
If you wanted to meet the smart money behind all of this,

769
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
then these guys were the best place to start.

770
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,200
They say that crypto is far more than just a financial innovation.

771
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,200
It's social, cultural, technological.

772
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,200
In the month of October of 2021, A16Z led a funding of $115 million

773
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,200
towards the company that was behind Axie Infinity.

774
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,200
A16Z general partner, Ariana Simpson,

775
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,200
claimed that this was an example of where Web 3 is going to revolutionize the internet.

776
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
In her own words, literally,

777
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
Axie embodies a new generation of games,

778
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
what this means for the future of games,

779
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,200
and really the web as we know it is as big as your imagination will allow.

780
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Where do I begin?

781
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Axie Infinity was what you would call a play to earn game.

782
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,200
It was this new genre of games appearing in the Web 3 space,

783
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,200
which, as the name suggests, allows players to make money when they play the game.

784
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,200
In the case of Axie Infinity, what you had was this game where people would breed,

785
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,200
collect, and fight with these creatures called Axies.

786
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,200
When battling inside the game, it was possible to earn this token called SLP,

787
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
which could actually be traded for real money.

788
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,200
So what started happening?

789
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
Well, people started playing the game,

790
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,200
but instead of focusing on the fun of the game,

791
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,200
the focus became on how to earn more SLP.

792
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
How do you profit from Axie Infinity?

793
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,200
The most expensive Axie ever sold was worth about $800,000.

794
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,200
I've invested $13,232.

795
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,200
To even play Axie Infinity, you had to purchase three Axie NFTs, right?

796
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
And as the value of Axie NFTs started to rise,

797
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,200
certain players wouldn't be able to afford the buy-in price.

798
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,200
So guess what started happening?

799
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Those who had the money to buy three Axies

800
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,200
began to lend their creatures out to players who couldn't afford it.

801
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
They were called Scholars.

802
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,200
How to set up your own scholarship program as a manager in Axie Infinity?

803
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
I'll be giving out a scholarship every two weeks,

804
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
so that's another six scholarships is my goal.

805
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,200
Scholars would then play the game using their rented Axies,

806
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,200
earn SLP, and then give a cut of their earnings to their managers.

807
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,200
My team of 12 scholars was roughly earning me $1,700 a month.

808
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
$600 from my scholars.

809
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,200
With all of my current scholarships working,

810
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,200
I'm earning about $6,000 a month.

811
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,200
Axie Infinity, a play to earn crypto gaming juggernaut

812
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,200
that has led people in countries like Philippines and Venezuela to make a living.

813
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,200
These are players from the Philippines who are making a living playing Axie Infinity.

814
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Most of the scholars who couldn't afford the buy-in price,

815
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,200
they were from developing countries, right?

816
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,200
People who likely saw Axie Infinity not as a game of leisure,

817
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,200
but as a means of producing income.

818
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,200
I am here to apply scholarship on Axie Infinity.

819
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,200
I want this scholarship because I want to earn more.

820
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,200
I can play six to twelve hours a day just for playing Axie Infinity.

821
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,200
I will treat this as a job, not just only a game.

822
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,200
I want to help my family under expenses and save up money for my tuition and college.

823
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,200
So I want to be a scholar so that I can meet the needs of my family.

824
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,200
What you ended up with was a game where players are playing in order to make money.

825
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,200
People are basically feeding their entire villagers playing our games.

826
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,200
But the only reason that they're making money is because others are buying in to also make money.

827
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,200
In the case of things like Axie Infinity, there actually are a bunch of innocent victims, right?

828
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,200
When you run a pyramid scheme, unfortunately you get a bunch of poor people in the Philippines

829
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,200
who are poor when they start and they're just hoping to make some money,

830
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,200
but then what happens is they actually lose money.

831
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,200
The value of SLP, which is the token that people use to actually make money in the game,

832
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,200
has fallen 99% since its peak and its user base has been in decline since.

833
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Times Magazine came out with this article and it was interviewing this guy called Samerson Orias,

834
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
a line cook from the Philippines who was facing financial stress after his mother had a stroke

835
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,200
and electricity and grocery bills were stacking up.

836
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Orias jumped into the Axie Infinity game and then exited 14 months later.

837
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,200
He described it as boring and stressful.

838
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Orias, along with other players of the game, told Times Magazine that Axie Infinity

839
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,200
reinforced predatory systems and gave them false hope.

840
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,200
It's already dystopian as hell, but then to say to people that by doing this

841
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,200
we are creating opportunity for people in the developing world.

842
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,200
That's not just dark, that's fucking evil.

843
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Again, I find myself coming back to the same question.

844
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,200
What is it that VC firms are seeing the potential in in this crypto space?

845
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,200
Why do they keep pouring money into it?

846
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,200
The overwhelming majority of tokens are securities.

847
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,200
But they're being dumped onto retail investors.

848
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,200
This is being done explicitly by venture firms, I won't mention any names,

849
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,200
who are buying into companies early, getting into tokens,

850
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,200
and then those tokens are being listed on exchanges.

851
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,200
The public is buying into them in order to get a financial gain.

852
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,200
They have no interest in using those tokens for any utility.

853
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,200
VC firms have a commonly used strategy.

854
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,200
They invest in a bunch of startups, most of those startups will fail,

855
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,200
a few will succeed, and with the ones that succeed,

856
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,200
a VC needs to decide on an exit strategy,

857
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,200
an event that allows them to liquidate their position in a company

858
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
and essentially make money.

859
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
This is a process that can take years.

860
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,200
So there's another idea that is proposed by skeptics,

861
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,200
that the world of crypto offers an incentive for VC firms to invest in a crypto company,

862
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,200
receive a percentage of their tokens,

863
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,200
and then sell those tokens to retail traders when it becomes publicly available.

864
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,200
All achievable within months, highly profitable, and fairly unregulated.

865
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,200
With crypto tokens, they can cash out in a few months,

866
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,200
and the way that this actually works is they encourage their fundees

867
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,200
to basically issue unregistered securities.

868
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Anderson Horowitz invested in a bunch of startups

869
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,200
that all issued tokens, that all got dumped on retail,

870
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,200
including Anderson Horowitz dumping a lot of them on retail.

871
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,200
This is blatant securities fraud,

872
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,200
but they didn't commit the securities fraud.

873
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,200
It was just the companies they invested in.

874
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,200
On the surface, Web 3 has this narrative,

875
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,200
which is all about taking money out of the hands of the rich and the big tech

876
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,200
and giving it back to the users.

877
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,200
But A16Z is the exact same company that has funded

878
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,200
some of the biggest Web 2 companies like Facebook and Twitter.

879
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
I'm sure that there are many inside of these firms

880
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,200
that really believe in the potential of Web 3

881
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,200
or crypto or blockchains or whatever buzzword you want to use,

882
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,200
but it becomes increasingly harder to see that as anything other than hyperoptimism

883
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,200
or another word for it, delusion.

884
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,200
There's this interview with Mark Andreessen, right,

885
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
who's the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz,

886
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,200
and he's on this podcast episode with an economist and blogger called Tyler Cohen,

887
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,200
and he proposes the idea for podcasts to make use of Web 3.

888
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,200
A well-known podcast host.

889
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,200
How does that person get paid in a better way through Web 3.0?

890
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Make that more concrete for us.

891
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,200
Now, Mark Andreessen is someone that, by all accounts,

892
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,200
should have a good answer to this question.

893
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,200
But instead...

894
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
Yeah, I mean, they can pick their business model.

895
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,200
I mean, they can pick their business model.

896
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,200
They can decide, you know, the business model, you know, microtransactions.

897
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,200
They can pick, you know, they can pick whatever model they want.

898
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,200
You know, they can also have indirect, you know, there's this whole new rise

899
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,200
of this kind of the non-fungible token.

900
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
You know, when pressed to give an actual use case,

901
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,200
what you get is an answer with all the right buzzwords and phrases,

902
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,200
but little actual substance.

903
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
I compare it to the Internet.

904
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,200
Like, in all seriousness, I compare it to the Internet, which is the Internet, basically.

905
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,200
It's 93 or so.

906
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,200
Yeah, it's like 93, 94.

907
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,200
This is the only time I've ever said this is like the Internet is this.

908
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,200
A16Z uses the same narrative that a lot of crypto enthusiasts will also use.

909
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,200
You may hate it, you may think it's a fad,

910
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,200
but crypto and Web 3.0 are just like the Internet.

911
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Even I made this comparison when I looked at the entire space in a more favorable light.

912
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,200
Now, though, I just think it's another form of smoke and mirrors.

913
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,200
It is the biggest technology shift since the Internet, the blockchain,

914
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,200
the consumer blockchains, the biggest new thing since the Internet itself.

915
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Bitcoin began in 2009.

916
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,200
Arguably blockchain technology and the foundations for it began even earlier than that.

917
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,200
It's been 13 years since this story began with Bitcoin.

918
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,200
13 years to find a solid use case, or at least one that justifies the hype

919
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,200
and is already better than an existing system.

920
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,200
Crypto and Web 3 is really great at one thing, which is trading in speculation.

921
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,200
And there is absolutely no democratization of anything.

922
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,200
There's centralization of exchanges, centralization of miners,

923
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:19,200
centralization of crypto wealth is the most concentrated amount of centralized wealth

924
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,200
in the history of humanity.

925
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:29,200
13 years after 1983, which is considered to be the birth of the Internet,

926
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,200
we were already seeing very clear card use cases.

927
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Even in those early days, people could get weather reports,

928
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,200
they could check the news, they could send emails and many other uses

929
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,200
that we still use to this day.

930
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,200
I sent a message to my doctor asking for a repeat prescription

931
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,200
and he's left the prescription for me in the chemist.

932
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,200
By even making the comparison to one of the biggest revolutions in information

933
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,200
and communication is already assuming that cryptocurrencies are revolutionary

934
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,200
and they're bound to find mass adoption at some point,

935
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,200
when that is the very future we're putting into question.

936
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,200
One recent post that I remember on the Bitcoin subreddit was titled

937
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,200
Does anyone else feel like Bitcoin is their literal last-ditch effort

938
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,200
to become wealthy in their lifetime?

939
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,200
I don't imagine that this is the only person in the crypto space that is thinking that way.

940
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,200
The crypto machine has continued running.

941
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,200
New packaging of ideas, more money funneled into the system

942
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,200
and a constant search to find a use case that justifies the hype

943
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,200
and the claims of revolutionary technology.

944
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,200
If the critics are right, then what we're looking at is a ticking time bomb.

945
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,200
If the critics are right, then this is a scheme that will leave

946
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,200
tons of regular individuals left holding their bags wondering how this managed to happen.

947
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,200
It already has a scheme that managed to infiltrate the realm of media and entertainment

948
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,200
that managed to make use of social media's ability to spread this fear of missing out.

949
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,200
They're capitalized on greed and a get-rich-quick mentality.

950
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,200
If the critics are right, then I suppose there's only one question that remains.

951
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,200
At what point does the ticking time bomb go off?
