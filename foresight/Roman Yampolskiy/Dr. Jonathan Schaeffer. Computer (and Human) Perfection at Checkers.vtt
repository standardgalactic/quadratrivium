00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
It's a great pleasure for me to introduce today's seminar speaker, Dr. Jonathan Schaefer.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
He's a world-famous expert on AI for games, games with AI, solving games, building world

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
championships, playing bots. They published a very famous paper on solving checkers.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
That's the punchline. Hey, you're giving away the spoiler.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
We already got to get some tools for this.

00:39.000 --> 00:50.000
He took a break and became a dean for about six years, so now hopefully we'll get him back on the side of science.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
I'll let you tell us what you actually are.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Great. Thank you very much. I'm delighted to be here. Thank you very much for coming on a Friday afternoon.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
I know that you're here for the talk. The pizza wasn't irrelevant in your decision to come here.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
This is a very strange talk. It's not the kind of talk that you're used to having.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm not going to go into much technical stuff. There are a few technical slides.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
I'll be delighted to talk technical after the talk.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
This is a very deeply personal story. It's something that happened to me that I didn't expect to happen.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
It affected me profoundly. This is a talk of stories.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
I'll apologize in advance because what usually happens is story after story.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
Oh my God, the one hour is up. The last part usually gets done very quickly and so my apologies.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
There's an important lesson in this talk that I want to pass on to graduate students.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
That's about research because there's two kinds of research.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
The first is the one that we're most familiar with. It's what I call inspiration.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
It's where you work and you think about problems and all of a sudden you get that aha moment.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
The light bulb goes off and you've got the idea that's going to allow you to prove this theorem

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
or you've got this great idea how to make this algorithm better

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
and you get that moment of inspiration and you're really pumped up and excited

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
and you code it or you write it up and voila, you've got a paper or maybe you've got a thesis or whatever.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
That's the kind of research that we most think about.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
But there's another kind of research which I call the perspiration research.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
It's the stuff that's really hard work.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
It may not be as glamorous as inspiration. It may not be as exciting as inspiration

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
but it's the kind of work that you have to do.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
If you're working say in operating systems and you've got to build an operating system

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
you might spend a year or two or three designing and building an operating system.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
There's a lot of perspiration before you get to the point where you can do the inspiration.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
This talk is about perspiration.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
This talk took 20 years to make.

03:12.000 --> 03:22.000
There aren't a lot of projects which take 20 years worth of human and computing power in order to achieve.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Let me talk about games and AI research.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
First of all I want to be clear. I'm an artificial intelligence researcher.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
When I was young I had a passion for games and I thought well I'm going to use games for my AI research.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
That's what sort of marked me throughout my career.

03:41.000 --> 03:50.000
My research has been applied to many other problems including scheduling, GPS, bioinformatics, all sorts of other things.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
When it comes to demonstrating the core ideas I like to use games and puzzles

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
because I can relate to an audience.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I can explain it in terms that people can understand.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
I like to use games as my experimental test bed but everything I do is much more general.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Games are just the way of illustrating the ideas.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
If you go back to the dawn of computing science, in fact if you go back even further

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
before computing science all the way back to Charles Babbage and his difference engine in the 1800s

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
people were thinking about building game playing programs.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
That's what Babbage wanted to do.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
That's what people like Alan Turing, one of the fathers of computing science, wanted to do.

04:38.000 --> 04:46.000
When AI became a discipline in the late 1950s at the famous Dartmouth conference

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
building a high performance game playing program is one of the big grand challenges.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Could we do it?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Today in 2018 we can look back.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
We can talk about Success in Chess, 1997 with Deep Blue.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
By the way, the co-author of Deep Blue, one of the three co-authors,

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
Murray Campbell, born and raised in Edmonton which is where I'm from.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
He did his bachelor's and master's degree at the University of Alberta

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
which is where I'm from before going to Carnegie Mellon to do his PhD.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Part of our game's lineage includes Deep Blue.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Backgammon, Jerry Tassara in the late 1990s.

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
He doesn't have a University of Alberta connection but he used reinforcement learning

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
which is a very powerful technique which is developed by Rich Sutton

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
who was a professor at the University of Alberta.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
Poker, it's a project that started in 1995 and in 2008 we went superhuman and two player,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
Limit Texas Holdem and so that was the University of Alberta success.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
You may have heard in 2015 we solved two player Limit Texas Holdem

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
and in 2017 and 2018 University of Alberta and Carnegie Mellon University

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
went superhuman in two player No Limit Texas Holdem.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
That's the game you see on TV.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
And Go in 2016, computers went superhuman and again just to brag,

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
the lead author on AlphaGo and AlphaZero, the programs that went superhuman.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
The lead author is David Silver who did his PhD at the University of Alberta

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
and the second lead was Azure Wang who did his postdoc there.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
So we've done a lot of work in AI using games at the University of Alberta

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
and our academic children and grandchildren have done a lot of work.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
But I was working in chess in the 1990s and I had one of the best chess programs in the world.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
It tied for first in the world computer chess championships in 1986

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
and a chance conversation with a friend said what happened with checkers?

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Everybody's talking about chess, what happened with checkers?

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Checkers is an interesting game, it's a simple but not so simple game

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
but it has all the same research opportunities as chess.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
So why weren't people looking at checkers?

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Now this isn't really a talk about checkers, this is really a talk about man and machine

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
and so I may use some checkers jargon but you don't need that to understand the talk.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
So what happened with computer checkers?

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
The first real game playing program was a checkers program developed in the early 1950s

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
but in the late 1950s a fellow named Arthur Samuel who went on to work at IBM

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
for most of his career developed a checker playing program to play against humans

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
and that's Samuel standing up.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
And in 1963 IBM sponsored a match, man versus machine,

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
Samuel's checker playing program versus a fellow named Robert Neely.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Now you have to think back to 1963 and use your imagination

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
because computers, this is not a computer in 1963, what is a computer?

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
A computer fills a half this room with vacuum tubes and spinning tape wheels

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
just like that of the Hollywood movies.

08:10.000 --> 08:22.000
And in 1963 IBM's machines running Samuel's software defeated Robert Neely in a single game.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Computer defeated man at checkers.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
Now I have this wonderful collection of articles from newspapers and magazines.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Computers defeat master Robert Neely at checkers.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Computers defeat US checkers champion.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Computers are as good as the world champion.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Computers solved the game of checkers.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Now let me be clear about the word solved.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Checkers has 5 times 10 to the 20th possible positions, 10 to the 20th.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
You guys are computer scientists, that's a lot of zeros.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
I have this wonderful, I wrote Samuel's family and got his unpublished autobiography

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
and in 1959 he writes excitedly, I got this fantastic, I got access to this fantastic new IBM computer

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
and that computer could do 15,000 additions per minute.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Now 15,000 addition operations per minute.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
You're not going to get to 10 to the 20th in my lifetime or your lifetime or whatever.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
So he had very slow computers and what happened was this got exaggerated out of control

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
because this was a milestone in a time when people didn't know

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
and didn't understand what computing technology was.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
This was the first demonstration, public demonstration of what computers could do.

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
It wasn't the typical application which was like missile trajectories

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
which is what many of the early computers were done.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
And in 1968 Samuel's program played an exhibition match against the world champion

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
and against the world championship challenger and the program got crushed.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Eight games. So the program wasn't very good.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
And for the record nearly, he was not world champion caliber.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
He was not US champion.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
He was not a master.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
He was, I can't remember which state now, was it Tennessee?

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
He was the Tennessee State Blind Champion.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
And so he was a good casual player.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
They played six games.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
The computer won one of the six.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Nearly one, sorry, nearly won two.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Three games were draws.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Nobody remembers except the one game that nearly won.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
And so even despite what I'm saying here this was an incredible result

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
because Samuel actually invented reinforcement learning

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
and although he didn't understand fully what he was doing

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
it was an incredible machine learning accomplishment.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
And so I got very interested in checkers because people ignored checkers

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
because Samuel had done all this work.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
So in 1989 I wrote my first research grant to say I want to try

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
and build a world champion caliber checker playing program.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
And I was very angry when the research granting agency

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
denied my request for a research grant and had the following quote in it.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
Okay, I was lost already.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
So what this talk is about is realizing Samuel's dream.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
It's man versus machine for the world checkers championship.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
We have two computers playing.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
One of them I developed.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
His name is Shanook.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
It's a computer program.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
And the other is a human program, the Marion Tinsley model.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
It was a computer.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
It was built in 1928.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
One-of-a-kind model.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
There were no replacement parts built.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
So it was just literally one-of-a-kind.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
No replacement parts for that computer definitely was a problem later on,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
as you'll see.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay, so let's talk about the challenger for the world championship,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Shanook.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Started as a project in 1988.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
I started playing around with it and well, it looked interesting.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
In 1989, the world computer chess championships were held.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
They're held every three years.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
And I co-organized them.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
They were in Edmonton.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
And I had expectations that my program would do well,

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
but it didn't.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
It crashed and burned.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Some friends of mine at another group, Carnegie Mellon,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
had a team called Deep Thought, which won the world championship.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
They later moved to IBM to become Deep Blue.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
And so I was so pissed off because I wanted to be world champion.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
And it turned out that in a couple of months,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
there was going to be the first computer Olympics,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
where games were going to be contested in it.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And over the span of two months,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I wrote a checker playing program,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
and I went to the computer Olympics.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
And in 1989, my program, which I named Shanook,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
won the computer Olympiad.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Now, interesting thing about this program,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
a little bit of technology.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
One of the things we built, which was amazing,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
its performance was the four-piece database.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Now, checker starts with 24 pieces on the board.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Pieces get removed.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And eventually, you could get down to like one piece.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And again, you don't need to know the rules,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
but if I have a piece and you don't have a piece,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
I win, you lose.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
But what we did is wrote a program that said,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
let's enumerate every single position with one piece on the board.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
And compute whether it's a win, loss, or draw.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Well, if you only have one piece, you win.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Done.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
But having done that, you can now do

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
what we call retrograde analysis, go backwards.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Let's solve all positions with two pieces on the board.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Because when you analyze with two pieces on the board,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
if one of them comes off, you're down to one piece,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
and you can look it up in your database.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
So you look up at all the two pieces.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Then you go to three pieces, which reduced to two.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And then you go to four.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Now, I had seven million positions,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
and I built that database.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
And as the program would search, whenever it got in

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
and its analysis came down to four pieces, it could stop.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Look up in its database and know whether the position

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
was a win, a loss, or a draw.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And we won the Olympiad against other computer programs,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
and it was clear that the program played very well

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
and that the databases made a big difference.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
So I was on sabbatical in 1989,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
and I started working on my program.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
And a checker playing friend who had seen the program said,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
you know, I'd really like to see how you would do

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
in the US championship.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
And I said, well, why do I want to do that?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
And he said, well, every two years there's the US championship

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
and there's the British championship,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
and the winner of those events gets to play

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
for the world championship.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
So if you can get into the US championship,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
you're going to be playing against the best players

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
in the world because they're all trying to earn the right

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
to play for the world championship.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
The problem is in the US championships there's three categories.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
The master category, which is for the best players in the world,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
masters, grandmasters.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
The majors, which is for the reasonably good players.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
And the minors, which is for the beginners.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And I said, wow, that's kind of cool.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
If I could get into the masters category,

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
then I'd have a chance to play against world class players

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
and see how we could do, right?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I mean, I want to build a strong program.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The problem was, how do I get in?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It's not like I can just walk in and say,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I got a great program.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Let me into the US championship in the masters, right?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
That'd be like me saying, hey, I think I'm a really great golfer.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
I want to go and play in the US open against Tiger Woods.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Ain't going to happen, right?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
So how do I get in?

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I'm fighting a battle because two years previously,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
a commercial manufacturer, who I will not name,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
said, oh, we have a checker playing program.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
We'd like to get into the US championship.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And people laughed at him.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
The program went into not the masters,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
not the major, to the minor section,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
which is where all the beginners are.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And you play 32 games in these tournaments,

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
and it lost its first 31 in games.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
And in game 32, something very strange happened,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and it won.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And nobody will admit what happened,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
except that the human opponent who lost

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
was very happy with his results.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
So people knew that this program was really pathetic.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And so I had this battle.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
How do I get into the master section?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
So I arranged something.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I said, OK, I'm going to be diabolical.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I arranged a, quote, conference,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
unquote, at the University of Alberta.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I invited a grandmaster who people said

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
he was receptive to playing computers,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
two grandmasters, and a master.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
And I brought them to Edmonton.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
I used my research money, which I didn't have for checkers

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
because that had been turned down.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I used my research money for parallel computing

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
because I was wink, wink, using multiple computers

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
to play checkers.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And I brought them there,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
and I had them play games against my program.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And over the span of a week,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
they played 20 competitive games against my program.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
And the grandmasters won four games,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
lost one, and there were 15 draws.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
And I was pissed off.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I was so angry.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
We lost.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
And my colleague said, man, you are so competitive.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
No, not really, but you are so competitive.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
You have no sense of perspective.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
And I said, what do you mean, he said,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
you've been working on this program less than a year.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
You beat a grandmaster.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
You only lost four to one.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
How strong is the program going to be in a year?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And he was right.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Lots of bugs in the program.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
It was very impressive.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
So the checkers conference,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
we had master level performance.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
And we had the five piece databases,

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
149 million positions.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
Now, what I did is I got the grandmasters

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
to write letters to the American Checker Federation

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
saying, hey, you know, this program is really good.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It shouldn't be in the minors.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It shouldn't be in the majors.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It'll compete in the masters.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
One of the grandmasters said, it'll compete in the master.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
It'll finish near the bottom,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
but it won't be embarrassing.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It'll be respectable.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And so I got these letters and I wrote away

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
to the American Checker Federation.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I said, let me into the masters.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And I waited and waited and waited.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And I finally got a letter back.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
And they said, yeah, OK, you can get into the masters.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
It'll be a novel.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
It'll be interesting.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It looks like you've got something

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
that at least will be entertaining for us.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And I said, fantastic.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
That was great.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And I thought, boy, I'm really surprised

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
they didn't write more.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
But OK, I'll take it.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
That's great.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
And then like a week later, I got another letter.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
And I thought, OK, they figured out what my strategy was.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
And I read the letter and it said, oh, by the way,

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
if you're not allowed to win any money.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
OK, you know, we're not going to win any money.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
And even if we did win money, you know, we wouldn't take it.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
In fact, I wrote them back and I said, look,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
we don't want any money.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
But in order to make this easy, we'll even offer a prize

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
for whoever plays the best game against the computer

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
to get prize money.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It turns out they were actually worried

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
we were going to win any money because there was

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
a $1,000 prize for the best junior player

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
under 18 years of age.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
And they were afraid that I would claim my program was

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
one year old.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
So they said, OK, fine.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
And then a week later, I got another letter.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Oh, you can't win any money and you're not

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
allowed to win any trophies.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
That's fine.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
I don't need trophies.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
That's OK.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
And I waited and waited.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
I expected one more letter, which I never got.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Who cares about the money?

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Who cares about the trophy?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
The real prize was if you won the tournament,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
you got the challenge for the world championship.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
They never thought about it.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
They never wrote a letter.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
And so we went to the US championships in the summer of 1990

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
not being allowed to win any money or trophies

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
and nothing else.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
So we had a surprise.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The week before the US championship,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
it was held in Tupelo, Mississippi.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Do not go to Tupelo, Mississippi in August.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Besides being hot, it's Elvis Presley's birthplace.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
And August is the anniversary of his birth.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
And the whole city is Elvis crazy.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
So, well, we had a big surprise.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
We went to the Mississippi state championship.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
16 games, first place, undefeated.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
And why that's amazing is because several of the grandmasters

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
had come early for the US championship

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
and they were playing.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
We beat them.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
We didn't lose a single game.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
What people didn't understand is that the program was

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
incredibly strong since the checkers conference

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
because we now had the six piece databases,

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
2.7 billion positions, and a whole bunch of bugs fixed.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
And this made a huge, huge difference.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
By the way, 2.7 billion positions,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
it was really stretching my research

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
grant capabilities at the time.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Remember, this is 1990.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
We're talking about billion.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Billion is a small number today.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
But in 1990, it was big.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
I had to scrounge money to get my first

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
one gigabyte disk, $5,000 plus tax and shipping.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
One gigabyte, 1990.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
So, computing 2.7 billion positions was a huge task in 1990.

22:52.000 --> 22:58.000
People were shocked that we won this.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
And the next week, we went into the US championship.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
And all the best players in the world were there,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
except for one.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
But most importantly, the world champion,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Marion Tinsley, was also there.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And the program started slowly.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
It was drawing game after game.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Why?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
We'd been winning.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Why were we drawing?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
It turned out that, of course,

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
playing in the Mississippi State Championship,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
all of a sudden people said,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
this program is really good.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
So they played really cautious draw checkers

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
because they wanted to escape with draws.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And halfway through the tournament,

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm so frustrated because we're drawing

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
and not winning enough games.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
But I put something in which I called the fudge factor.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
It was just, you know, we've got to do something.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
So I put in a very simple line of code

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
that penalized the program for reducing

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
the number of pieces on the board.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
The idea was that the more pieces on the board,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
the more complex the position was,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
and the more complex it was,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
the higher the probability the human would make a mistake.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
So if the program started exchanging pieces

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
to reduce the number of pieces, it got a penalty.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
And so all of a sudden, like overnight,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
the program became a monster

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
and started winning and winning and winning.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
And after 24 games, we're now in second place.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
First place is the World Champion.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
And in the seventh round, a four-game match,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
we had to play the World Champion.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
This was the first time in history that a human

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
and a computer played a match that was not an exhibition match.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
This was the real thing.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
Tinsley had to play us or forfeit.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
First game of the match turned out to be a classic.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
First of all, there's the World Champion.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
There's me.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
We're playing against each other.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And there's this ring of players,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
two, three, four, deep around watching,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
because I remember one checker player saying,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I want to see Tinsley spank the computer.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
They wanted to see Tinsley beat this upstart computer

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
because it hadn't lost.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And I'm not a checker player,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
so I live and die based on the evaluation

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
that the computer gives me.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
It's like the stock market.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
The number goes up, you're happy,

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
and the number goes down,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
and you're wondering, what do you do?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
We're 10 moves into the game,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
and the computer says it's equal,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
maybe a small advantage to the computer,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and I'm sitting there thinking pretty smugly,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
this is great, World Champion,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
10 moves in, we're invincible.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.000
And then he played a move that sacrificed the checker.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
And the moment he made the move,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
you could hear the chuckles in the room.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Because for a human, this was an obvious move,

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
and it gave Tinsley an incredibly strong position.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
And within a minute or two of him playing this move,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
all the spectators disappeared

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
because in their mind, the game was over.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And I'm sitting there thinking,

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
we just were out to check her up,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Chinook is happy, we're going to win,

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
this is great.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Then a couple moves later, we're up a checker,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
the position's even, this is still great.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
And a few moves later, we're up a checker,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Tinsley's got an advantage, that's all great.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
And a few moves later, things look really bleak.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
And we're playing on, and an hour goes by,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
and a few players start coming back,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
looking what's going on.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
And more time goes by, and more people come by and watch.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
And then finally, Tinsley reaches out,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
stops the clock, extends his hand,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
and offers a draw.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
It turns out, Tinsley's sacrifice was sound.

26:43.000 --> 26:48.000
There was a very long and narrow path to a win.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
He could have won the game.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
And he made most of the moves correctly,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
and then at the end, he slipped up,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
and it became a draw.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
The next three games against Tinsley were uneventful,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and they all ended in draws.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
We had just drawn a four-game match

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
against the world champion.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
In the last round, we were paired against the world's

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
number two player, Don Lafferty.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
We won a game, we drew three,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Tinsley won his match,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
and the end result was that Tinsley finished first,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Chinook finished second,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
and the rules of the competition were that

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
the first-place finisher was challenged

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
for the world championship,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
and if the first-place finisher was the world champion,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
that right went down to the second-place finisher.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
So in the summer of 1990,

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
Chinook became the official world championship challenger.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
The first thing I did after this is I tried to find

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
Arthur Samuel and tell him what had happened,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
and he had left IBM long ago.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
It turns out he had moved to California,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
who's at Stanford University,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
working for Donald Knuth on tech.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
I'm sure you're all familiar with tech, or lay tech.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
It's a variant system,

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
and it turns out, much to my shock,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
like three days before we won the right to play

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
for the world championship, Samuel had passed away.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
It turns out he, in the last years of his life,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
had been suffering for Alzheimer's disease.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
He liked to claim he was the world's oldest programmer.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Up to age 90, he was going in every day to

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Stanford University writing code

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
for the development of the tech system,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
and it just seemed ironic that we finally realized

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
his dream, in some sense,

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
and he passed away just as that was happening.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
All right.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Let's talk about the champion.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Marion Tinsley.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
1950, he was the up-and-coming favorite

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
to win the U.S. championship,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
play for the world championship, and win it.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
In 1950, he's playing in the last round

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
for the U.S. championship.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
In a winning position,

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
he had a one-move oversight,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
and blundered, and lost the game,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and he didn't finish first,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
which means he didn't play for the world championship,

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
and he was stunned.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Everybody was shocked.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
He disappeared for two years.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
He came back in 1952 and he won everything,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
including the right to play for the world championship,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
went to the world championship, and won it.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
In 1958, he won the world championship,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
or defended his world championship,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
and then he retired.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
He said, you know what?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I don't need this anymore.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
He went and finished his Ph.D. in math

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
at Ohio State University.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Friends convinced him to come back in 1970.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
He won the U.S. championship,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
was going to play for the world championship,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
but the world champion was ill.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
He had a heart attack.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Tinsley said, I don't want to play him,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
and so he went back into retirement.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
In 1975, the world champion at the time died.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Tinsley was convinced to come back.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
He won the U.S. championship,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
he won the world championship,

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
played it, held it until 1991 when he retired.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
If you go back to that fateful game in 1950,

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
and look what he did between 1950 and 1991,

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
he finished first in every tournament he played in.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
Not shared first, first.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
He played multiple matches,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
including for the world championship,

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
and he won them, usually by a wide margin.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
And he literally crushed the opposition.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
So early on, I called Mary and Tinsley a human computer.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Well, there's some truth in that.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Is this man or machine?

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Because from the period 1950 to 1992,

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
Tinsley only lost three games of checkers.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
Three games of checkers out of thousands that he played.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
You don't think of humans being that good.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
You think of machines having that level of perfection.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
If you ever asked Tinsley how many games he lost,

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
he would shake his head sadly and say it was five.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Five. Why was it five?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Well, Tinsley often gave exhibitions,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
so somebody would organize,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
like you're going to play 40 people at a shopping mall,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
you're going to play them all simultaneously,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
well, once at a shopping mall,

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
while playing 40 people simultaneously in a winning position,

31:38.000 --> 31:45.000
he inexplicably made a one-move blunder and lost.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I asked Grandmaster Don Lafferty

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
for many years the world's second best player

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
if he'd ever beaten Tinsley,

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
and the answer was yes, once.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
On a Saturday night, late at night,

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
after we'd both had far too much to drink.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
That was the only time Lafferty ever beat him.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Five losses over 40 years.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Basically, Tinsley's computer brain,

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
there was a neuron up there that misfired about every 14 years,

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
causing him to make a one-move blunder and lose a game.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
There's only one recorded game where he got outplayed.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
This man was more a machine than man.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
So, prelude to the match.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
We had just earned the right to play Tinsley

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
for the world championship.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
What do you think the first thing Tinsley does?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
He phones me up and he says,

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
hey, let's play a fun match.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
What? The world champion wants to play a fun match?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
He says, yeah, sure.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
He's bored playing humans because he beats them.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
And so we wanted to test himself out against the computer.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
So we arranged for him, brought him to Edmonton,

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
and we played a match, and he beat us 7.5 to 6.5.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
The first nine games were draws.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
In the 10th game on the 10th move, something happened.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
The program says even.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
The program was flip-flopping between two moves,

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
and at the last minute chose a particular move.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
In the moment I made that move, Tinsley said,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
you're going to regret that.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And of course, I'm looking at the screen

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
and it says the game is even.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
And a few moves later, Tinsley got an advantage,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
and a few moves later, he's better,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and you know the whole story.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
We lost that.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I was obsessed with that position.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
I've done the analysis to the point from when he said

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
you're going to regret that to the loss is 64 moves.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
And of course, I realized there's no way

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm going to write a program that's going to analyze that deep.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
I mean, the exponential growth is just enormous.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
It just brought home how deep he was thinking

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and he understood the game.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
So we ended up losing the match 1 win to 0, 13 draws.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
And again, being competitive, I was very upset that we lost.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
But the checker world was a gog,

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
like you only lost by one game against Tinsley.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
That's incredible.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Most telling was at the end of the match,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Tinsley said, I feel like a teenager again.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
And I asked what he meant and he said,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
playing against humans is boring.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Everybody knows how good I am.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
And so they play drosh, boring games

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
because all they want to do is escape with the draw.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
Nobody tries to beat me because they're not going to beat me.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
Chinook had no respect for me.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
It would walk on the edge of a precipice.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
It would play loud, audacious, ridiculous moves, taunting Tinsley.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
And he loved it and it reminded him of the rambunctious games

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
that he played when he was a teenager,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
when he was learning the game.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
And he said, I feel like a teenager again.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I want to play the computer.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
Checkers is fun again.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
And so, well, we ran into problems.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
The American Checker Federation

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
and the English Drafts Association refused to sanction the match.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
They said, oh, computers can't play.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
This is the human world championship, they can't play.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
And I said, look it, we abided by all the rules.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
And they said, no you can't.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
And then Tinsley said, I want to play the computer.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And the Checker Federation said no.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
And he wrote a public letter saying they deservedly came second.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
They were very strong.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I want to play them.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
The Checker Federation said no.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
So he said, OK, I resign.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
No need the world championship, the world title.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
And then he immediately signed on to play as a match.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
The Checker Federations were agogged.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
How can you have Tinsley not being the world champion?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
But he refused to take the title back.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
And so they gave him the title world champion emeritus.

36:12.000 --> 36:20.000
And so they created a world man machine championship for the best man,

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
which was Tinsley, the best machine, which was Chinook.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
And in August 1992, we went to London to play for the World Checkers Championship.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
And there we are, the Park Lane Hotel.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Nice 3D visualization board.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
You can't see it very clearly, but every time a move was made here on the computer,

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
there was a group up here, big audience.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Checkers is very popular, or drafts as it's called in the UK.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
And so we had packed rooms for all of the games.

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
So match starts and the first thing, the first day was terrible.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Tinsley pressed hard in game one.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
And I thought we were going to lose.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
And I'm sitting on stage and I'm sweating.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
All the media is there.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
I mean, this was a big event.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Think Deep Blue.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
And I'm sitting there, please, don't let me lose on day one.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Please don't let me lose.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
And I thought we're going to lose.

37:15.000 --> 37:21.000
And then all of a sudden, the program found its way into a draw.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
And I knew we were safe.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
We now had the seven-piece databases and a few of the eight-piece,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
37 billion positions in the database.

37:30.000 --> 37:37.000
And the program had found a path from the current position into a drawn database position.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I offered Tinsley a draw.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
He declined.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So we played on a few more moves.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
And I offered Tinsley a draw again.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
And he declined.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
We played on a few more moves.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I offered him again.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
And he declined.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And I said, look, Marion, we're in our databases.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
It's a draw.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
You can play as long as you want, but we're not going to lose.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
And he was stunned.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
He was sure he was winning.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
So he immediately shook hands and we went on to the next game.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Tinsley won game five.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
He played better.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
And he was winning in game seven and couldn't.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Again, the program made his life complicated and we saved it.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
And so clearly after the first few days of the matches,

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
the consensus looked like we were going to get crushed.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I'm full of stories and I'm going to run late.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
But I have to tell you this story here because this is very important.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
About halfway through the match, I got an email from back home.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
And all it said was database failure.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
Uh-oh.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
I was computing databases.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
And in the rush to get to the match,

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
I knew that the more databases made the program stronger.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Half the time was spent computing the database

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
and the other half was spent verifying it.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
So about a couple months before the end,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
before we went to London, I made the decision

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
I'm going to stop the verification because I want more databases computed.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I'll take a gamble.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And now that I'm in London playing the match,

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
I said okay, I'll start the verification running

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
because it's too late to compute any more databases.

39:17.000 --> 39:24.000
And of course one of the databases failed and sent me an email.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
But there's nothing I can do it.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
I'm in the middle of the match.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Nothing I can do.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
After the match was over, this took place in August and September.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I finally got back home and had some free time

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
and I started looking what happened with the databases.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
And I tracked it down to a database.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
The database was there.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
It was the right size, everything.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
The contents were all zero.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
The file was just full of null bytes.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
But in my compression scheme, a zero meant draw.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
So if you ever got into that database,

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
it didn't matter what position, it was all draws.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
Guess which database it was.

40:05.000 --> 40:13.000
It turns out that in the game we were in a drawn position.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
And if Tinsley had kept playing,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
it's possible we would have moved to a position

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
that was actually a loss.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
And of course I told him information that was actually wrong

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
and we did draw the game and we were never in a losing position

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
but had he kept playing, it's possible we could have lost that.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
So very scary.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
So we're down one to nothing.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Now, game eight.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Game eight starts and we had prepared the program

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
with some complex moves and it's a try and put Tinsley on his own.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
And in game eight, an opening came up

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
that we were able to play a move that was quite complex

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
and everything went well.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Until about move 12, when Tinsley made a move

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
and Chinook suddenly said,

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
the game is no longer even, we have a small advantage.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
And a few moves later, the advantage got bigger.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And a few moves later, the advantage got bigger.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And my eyes started bugging out.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm on the stage and I'm sitting there

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
trying to hold in my excitement.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
And I got bigger and bigger and bigger.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
And then finally, Tinsley reached out his hand

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
and resigned.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
And I was stunned.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
And the crowd rushed up and surrounded us.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
All excited and everything because it had been an exciting game.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
And they all started congratulating Tinsley.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
And okay, I understand giving sympathy,

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
but hey, we won, this is like, we beat Tinsley.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
This is big news.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And everyone's congratulating Tinsley

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
and I didn't understand what was going on

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
until the match arbiter, Con McCarrick,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
goes over to Tinsley and shakes his hand and said,

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
I, Narian, that was a beautiful draw.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
The depth of the games was such that people in the audience

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
didn't understand that Tinsley had resigned.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
They thought it was a draw.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
And Tinsley had to correct them.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
And then they were stunned.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
One of the reporters at that,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
because this was the last game of the day,

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
one of the reporters, I don't remember which media outlet was there,

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
the end of the day, he just ran out and filed his story.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
And of course the next day he says,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
yeah, the games were all draws.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
He had no idea that we had just made history.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
Now, what do you do after you beat Tinsley?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
It was like a dream of mine to beat Tinsley.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
I mean, I had asked Laine in bed,

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
just fantasizing about beating Marion and Tinsley.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
My wife looked at me sadly once while we were lying in bed

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
and she said, you're thinking about him again, aren't you?

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
I mean, what would you do if you finally beat Tinsley?

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
I thought I'd go out and party and buy a round for everybody,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
I'd get drunk and whatever.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
And me and my team, we went out that night and it was like a wake.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
We were truly sad.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Over the few years we'd known Tinsley, we'd come to respect him

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
and we knew how painful this defeat was

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
and how upset and angry he was that losing.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
And we felt a little bit of humanity ourselves

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
because we knew this was a milestone

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
that computers are now beating the very best humans at checkers

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
and if not checkers, eventually it would be chess.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
And so it was a very sad event.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
And that night, you know, I got back to my hotel room

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
and at three in the morning a reporter phoned me up

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
and I poured out my heart and soul to this reporter how upset I was.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
Lesson, do not pour your heart and soul out to a reporter

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
because guess what appears the next day in the paper

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
is a lot of things that you probably didn't want to say.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
It was actually pretty upsetting and I learned a lot about myself.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And so in Game 8 we won.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
It was the first time a computer had defeated a world champion

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
in any game that was a non-exhibition game.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
The next few games were draws

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
and in Game 14 it happened again.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
He must have made an inferior move

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
and the advantage went up, up and up

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
and then the computer froze.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
And I'm panicking.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
It stopped. What's going on?

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
I had to leave my seat and go behind the curtains

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
where the computer was to take a look at the screen.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
What's going on? Oh my, we've crashed. Something's wrong.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
No. The computer had searched all the way to the end of the game,

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
had looked at all the scenarios,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
it knew it was winning in every possible scenario.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
There was nothing left to compute.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
So it had stopped.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
And a few moves later, Tinsley resigned and we won.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
We were in up two to one.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
That night I had no problems.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
We went out and we partied.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
We had a great time.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
We were up two to one against the unbeatable Tinsley.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Fantastic.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
On the way back home that night

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I turned to my colleague and I said,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
do you think it's possible?

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
Do you think we're going to beat Tinsley?

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
Wish I'd never said that.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Okay.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
This is

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
the most painful day of my life.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
August 23, 1992.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.000
It's game 18.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
We're on move 17.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Chinook has a big advantage

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
and I'm sitting there on stage thinking,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
actually sorry, let me go back.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I'm jumping ahead.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
I did first thing in the morning what I always would do.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Get up early, go down to the room,

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
make sure, you know, run the diagnostics on the computer,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
make sure everything's okay.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Get down to the room,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
unlock it, open the doors,

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
and I'm blasted by heat.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
It was a small room and it was hot,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
really hot.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
What was wrong?

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
Well, you see, it's hard to get good help these days.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
The hotel staff in the evening were supposed to

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
turn off the lights in the room

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
and turn on the air conditioning.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Off, on.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
What they instead did is turn the lights on

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
and the air conditioning off in a small sealed room.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
So it was really hot.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
And when they opened the door,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
the heat flooded out into the main room

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
where everybody would sit.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
And so the first game that day was postponed for an hour

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
because the embarrassed hotel staff

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
had to go out and rent fans to try and cool the room down.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
And so game 17 was played this Saturday morning

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
and we played it and we were sitting up on stage,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
which was even hotter.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
And after five moves, Tinsley just said,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
look, I'm uncomfortable, I'm sweating.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
This is ridiculous.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Let's just agree to a draw and take a break.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
And I said, I'm up with it.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
So game 17 was like a quick draw, done, finished.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
We're off the stage, spectators were disappointed.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
But there was another hour break

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
while we cooled the place down.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Then we started game 18.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Move 17.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Chinook's got a nice advantage.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
And I'm sitting there on stage thinking, ha, ha,

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
this Tinsley guy, he's not so good.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
We've got a big advantage.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
We're probably going to win.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Fantastic.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Great.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
And then the computer comes up and says,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
beep, Tinsley database.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
I thought, oh, darn.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
I had put into the program's databases

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
all of the games that I could find that Tinsley had ever played.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
And so when the Tinsley database message came up,

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
it found a way to go from the current position into a game

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
that Tinsley had previously played.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
And Tinsley had this incredible memory.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
He knew every single game that he'd ever played.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
And I knew his memory was amazing.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
And so I knew, even though the program said,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
we were really, really in a good position,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I knew that we were going to draw it

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
because he would know this.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
And I'm sitting there on stage

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
and just waiting for the program to move.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
Draw me my fingers.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
We had about 40 minutes left on our clock

48:49.000 --> 48:54.000
to get to move 20.

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
So you have to play 20 moves in an hour.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
We're at move 17.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
So we only have three moves to make.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And we've got 40 minutes.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
And the clock takes by.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
And I'm dreaming, we're going to be up three to one.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
This is going to be fantastic.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Man, just think of all the good things that are going to happen

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
with this milestone event.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Hmm, it's been 20 minutes.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
That's a long think.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Wait a minute.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
The program actually has a hard stop of 20 minutes for a move.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
We're really over 20 minutes?

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Yeah, we are.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
How could that be?

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
And 20 minutes became 25 minutes.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
And then 30 minutes.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I'm sitting there on stage.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
You've got all of the media there.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
You've got a couple hundred spectators.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
During a game, I can't interfere in any way.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
The program has to make the moves.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
I'm just the operator.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
And I sat there panicking because the program is just

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
computing, computing, something's going on.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
And I watched there helplessly as the minutes ticked off.

50:00.000 --> 50:07.000
And I watched the hour hand go around to the top

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
and then click our one hour was up.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
We did not make the 20 moves.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
We forfeited.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
And so now, of course, what happens?

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
Well, I tried to talk to the computer, but I couldn't.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
It was frozen.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
It had crashed.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
Something was wrong.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Actually, it hadn't crashed.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
It was frozen.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
I had no idea how that happened.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Tinsley was apologetic at winning this way,

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
but now the match was 2-2.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Nothing I could do.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
And it was just absolutely terrible.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
I spent that whole weekend trying to figure out what happened.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Was there a bug?

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I don't know how to freeze the computer.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
I don't know how my checker program could have frozen

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
this 8-processor Silicon Graphics computer,

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
but somehow it became frozen.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Was it a hardware problem?

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
The computer had been baked all night in this hot room.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
And I talked to Silicon Graphics and they showed me a paper

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
out where they took their 8-processor Silicon Graphics

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
computer out to Death Valley in California for a weekend

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
and it correctly in parallel computed pi.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
And so therefore, you know, it works in really hot weather

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
that you can compute pi.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Well, I said, you know, pi isn't like this.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
We've got 8 processors, complex interactions,

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
a lot of message passing, a huge amount of disk activity

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
because you're reading the databases.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
It's not the same thing.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Silicon Graphics said there was no hardware problem.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Was it a hotel problem?

51:39.000 --> 51:44.000
I mean, it didn't happen any day before.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It never happened again.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
It only happened on this day when the computer got baked.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
I have no idea what happened that day.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
But we forfeited.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
And I spent the entire weekend at the computer

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
working with it, testing it, trying to recreate the problem.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
And I showed up Monday morning to play Tinsley

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
and he was dressed as he usually is in a three-piece suit

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
and I had bags under my eyes and stubble on my face

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
because I'd literally been up the whole weekend

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
trying to figure out what was going on.

52:15.000 --> 52:20.000
And to this day, I had no idea what happened except we lost.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
One of the most horrible experiences of my life

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
was sitting on stage for the last half of that 40 minutes

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
knowing that something is wrong,

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
something helpless to do anything

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
and listening to the audience,

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
the audience talking in murmury.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
As it came closer and closer to the program forfeiting,

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
you could just hear the people,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
what's going on? What's going on?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Why isn't it moving? What's happening?

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
And as the program ticked down to forfeiting,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
you'd just hear people go,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
what? Move! Do something!

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
And I'm on stage and I'm helpless

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
and there's nothing I could do and it's just burned into my head

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
and we lost.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
The next day, or a couple days later,

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
Tinsley accidentally won Game 25

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
and he paid us the sincerest compliment.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
He said, I've had a scare.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
I'm now going to play drosh, boring checkers against you

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
and I'm going to wait for you to make a mistake

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
in Game 25 and he played dull, boring drosh checkers

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
the west of the way and we never had a chance to win a game.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
That was the ultimate compliment

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
because he had criticized other players

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
for playing that way against him

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and now he was playing that way against us.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
In Game 39, we're down by one game.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
We need to win the game.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
I set the program to have a draw being equal to a loss

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
because a draw did us no good

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
and of course the program found a draw

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
and would not take the draw

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
because I'd set it to be a loss

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
and we kept playing trying to win

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
and we eventually lost.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
The final score was 20.5 for Tinsley,

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Chinook, 18.5.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
People were impressed.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
It was a great result

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
but it might have been different

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
had it not been for Game 18.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
A couple weeks after the match,

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
the nightmare started.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
I started reliving Game 18,

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
those final 20 minutes.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
I'd wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
because I could hear the voices in the audience.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
Why isn't it moving? What's going on?

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
It happened night after night after night.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
People told me I had an interesting story

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
so I decided I had to write a book

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
and I wrote a book

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
but I could not write about Game 18

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
it upset me so much

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
and finally I had the whole book written

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
except for this part

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
and I said I got to do it, I got to do it, I got to do it

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
and I sat down

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
and I wrote about Game 18.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Done. I never went back and edited.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
Done. Finished.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
And I never had the nightmares again.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
They stopped the next day.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
Gone.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
If I had known

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
that this would be so therapeutic to write this out

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
and express my feelings and emotions,

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I would have done it long ago

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
but in the end I tortured myself by not writing it.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
Anyway, the book came out in 1997.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
One jump ahead challenging human supremacy in checkers

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
and I'm very proud of it.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
It's not technical, it's this talk that I'm giving.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
It's this and many other stories.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I wanted revenge

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
so I had to spend two years waiting for a rematch in 1994.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
1994, deeper searching.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
We're going 17 to 29 moves ahead.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
What human can think compute that far but Tinsley could?

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
Improving our openings, improving our knowledge,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
improving our end games.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
We eventually computed all of the AP's databases.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
406 billion positions in the program's memory.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
The match was played at the computer museum in Boston.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
That museum has now moved to Mountain View, California.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
And it went off to a very strange start.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
On the first day I phoned up Tinsley and I said,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
let's walk over to the museum together and he said, fine.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
And we're walking over and he's unusually quiet.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
And then he tells me something strange.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
First of all you need to know that Tinsley was also a Baptist minister.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
He was a very religious person.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
And he talked many times about doing God's work.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
And on the walk over he turns to me and he said,

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
I had a dream last night.

56:50.000 --> 56:58.000
And he said, in that dream God told me that he loved you too.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
That he loved Jonathan as well.

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
And I looked at Tinsley in shock because at times he sort of portrayed me as the devil, right?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
And he's doing God's work to slay the devil.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
And I looked at him in shock and he looked at me back

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
and he shook his head sadly and I said, I know.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
It was a very upsetting dream.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
But this was so on Tinsley-like.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
And then we played game one and it was a draw.

57:25.000 --> 57:34.000
And then we played game two and Tinsley was in a lot of trouble.

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
And we thought he might lose it and in the end he squeaked out a draw

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
and it came to a critical position and after the game he told me

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
and he said there were six moves in that position.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
I knew that five of them lost and the sixth one I didn't know

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
and I just put my faith in God and played the sixth move.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
And it drew and I thought, boy this isn't like Tinsley.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
He's such a confident person.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
How could he just put his faith in God and make a move and not know?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Very strange.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
A couple of games later he asked me about Derek Oldbury.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
Derek was the world champion because remember Tinsley had resigned.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
Derek was now the world champion but he got no respect

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
because he was nowhere near Tinsley's class.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
And he knew that I'd played,

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
Chinook had played an exhibition match against Oldbury

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
as preparation to play Tinsley and it was all secret

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
and unfortunately Oldbury died about a month before we played Tinsley

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
and Tinsley asked, well now that Derek's dead it doesn't matter.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
Maybe you could tell me what happened in the match

58:37.000 --> 58:42.000
and I said well we beat Oldbury, three wins, no losses, 13 draws.

58:42.000 --> 58:49.000
And Tinsley said, hmm, Chinook plays Oldbury.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
Oldbury dies.

58:52.000 --> 58:59.000
Therefore Oldbury must have died of Chinookitis.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
That is so funny.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
He dies of Chinookitis.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
And I'm sitting there thinking, what's so funny about that?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
First of all his logic is terrible.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
But second of all to tie Oldbury's death,

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
well if you play Chinook you're going to die.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
And so it was a very morbid discussion.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
Anyway the first six games were all drawn.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Chinook's play was flawless.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
Chinook looked bloody impressive.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
The next day I phoned Tinsley up and I said, let's go.

59:33.000 --> 59:40.000
Walked together and he immediately said, sorry,

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
let me suggest the unthinkable.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
He said, I'd like to resign the match and the title to Chinook.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
And I said why?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
And he said, well I had an upset stomach last night

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
I wasn't feeling well.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
And I said, okay, you're not feeling well.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
I'm sorry about that.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
We're going to postpone the games for today.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Really, I don't want to play.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Look, let's take you to the hospital.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
We'll figure it out.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Let's get you better and then we'll worry about the match.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And he said, fine.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So I took him to the hospital.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
He spent a whole day there.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
They did tests.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And because of the upset stomach the doctors gave him the okay

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
but they wanted to do X-rays as a precaution.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I mean he was like 65, 66 years old.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And at the end of the day Tinsley was in a good mood

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and said, yeah, we'll play again tomorrow.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
So I thought, dodged a bullet.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The next morning Tinsley says I resigned the match

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
and the title and you can't do anything about it.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Done.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So what's wrong?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
He said I had my upset stomach again.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And I said, but you got your X-ray.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We're going to hear the results.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And he said, no, we're done.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
He was adamant we couldn't do it.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
But he agreed to postpone the announcement of the match

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
until after the X-ray results were known.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So I went to the match site and told the rest of my team

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and we were all upset and we're sitting there

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
and the media is there and spectators are there.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
What do you do?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
We're all set up to play and there's no Tinsley

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
and we're not going to announce that he's resigned

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
because he agreed to postpone it.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
What happens?

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Tinsley shows up.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
What does he want to do?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
He wants to play checkers.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Not a game.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
He wants to analyze some positions.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So we sit there for an hour analyzing positions

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
and the match arbiter comes in and says, what the hell is going on?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I said, we're playing checkers with Tinsley.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And he said, the guy is apparently too sick to play the match

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
that he's resigning.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
What's he doing here?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And I said, that's what he wants to do.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And he said, well, what were the results of the X-ray?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And I said, I don't know.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
He hasn't called.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
So the arbiter goes up and says, why haven't you called

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
about the X-rays?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And he says, well, I'll call now.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So he disappears and we're all sort of perplexed at his behavior.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Tinsley makes the phone call, comes back.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And I said, well, what were the X-ray results?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And he said, ah, they found a lump on my pancreas.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah, no big deal.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
You see, bright and cheery.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Now, if it was me, I would have been scared to death.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
A lump on my pancreas, that doesn't sound good.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But the match officials sent him home because they're

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
about to announce that he's too sick to play.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And you couldn't have somebody too sick to play sitting there

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
playing checkers.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
He refused to continue.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And we won the world championship after six games,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
all draws on forfeit.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
What do you do when you're in Boston all set up for a world

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
championship and you have nothing to do?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Tinsley said, why don't you bring in Don Lafferty,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
the world's number two player, and play an exhibition match?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
We were so upset.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
We just wanted to go home.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
We played Lafferty.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
We lost a game.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
We've gone like 150 games without a loss.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I've been so careful in testing the program.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
A couple weeks before, I found something wrong.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And I've been in a rush and I fixed it.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And I had an if statement, which had an and in it.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And it should have had an or.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And I hadn't tested it.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And we lost the game.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
We won another game.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Lafferty played boring checkers to draw every game.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So it was a drawn match and we retained the title.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So we win it on forfeit and we retain it with a draw.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
It was absolutely terrible.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Then the American Checker Federation and the English

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Drafts Association threatened us with legal action.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Of course, there was a contract that said whoever wins

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
the match is world champion, but they threatened us

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
with legal action.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And then they wrote angry letters to my chair,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
my dean, my university president, and the media.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
There was an anti-Shanuk internet campaign.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It was a horrible time.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
In 1995, January, we played another match against Lafferty

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
and we beat him.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
In April 1995, Tinsley unfortunately passed away.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It turned out that that lump on his pancreas

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
was pancreatic cancer and he passed away.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And in 1996, Shanuk was crushing everybody.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Because nobody was even close to Tinsley.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
In the U.S. championship, there were 32 games.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It scored 30 out of 32 points.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Second place scored 22 out of 32 points.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I mean, the gap was so huge.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
It was a horrible time.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And we got lots of accolades which made things better.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
First computer to win a human world championship in any game.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's from the Guinness Book of World Records.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
We're a trivial pursuit question, which is kind of cool.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
We're on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
A popular game show from a few years back.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It was a $16,000, only $16,000 question.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Come on.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
But for me, there was still a sense of unfinished business.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I'm over time, so I will speed up and finish this talk.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
My apologies.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
But then I started getting all the hate mail

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
from the checkers player.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Shanuk doesn't hold a candle to Tinsley.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
In his prime, Tinsley would crush Shanuk.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
You know, Tinsley was almost perfect.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
He did lose three games.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
He wasn't perfect.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And if I wanted to prove to everybody that my program was

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
better than humans, I had to be better than Tinsley.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
If he was almost perfect, I had to be perfect.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So I had to solve the game of checkers.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
There are some games that you can solve that are simpler.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
They have smaller search complexity or decision complexity.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Checkers is 500 billion billion positions.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's a big number.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I'm sure you have no idea how to comprehend a number like that,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
but I'll give you a good example.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Let's take the Pacific Ocean.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And I know that you probably don't study oceanography,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
but if you go to the deepest part, there's actually a big plug there.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
And if you remove the plug and drain all the water,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
it's really a big sink, and you drain all the water

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and it's empty and you put the plug back in,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
now your task is to refill the Pacific Ocean.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So we're going to give you a house in Seattle.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
You can turn on the tap and I'm going to give you a teaspoon.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
You can put the teaspoon underneath the tap,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
walk over to the Pacific Ocean,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
and dump the teaspoon into the Pacific Ocean.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And then go back and fill another teaspoon with water

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and go over to the Pacific Ocean and dump it in.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
If you do it roughly this number of times,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
you will refill the Pacific Ocean.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I'll leave that as an exercise for the ambitious student.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Basically, for a non-trivial game,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
checkers was 10 to the 7 times bigger than Awari,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
which had been solved.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So we're talking about 10 million times bigger.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And I said, I'm going to solve this problem.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And I'm going to do it.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And people said, well, why don't you do it incrementally,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
bits at a time?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I said, no.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
My goal is I want one fantastic paper in science.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
That's my goal.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And then I got a review back saying,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
what a moron, Jonathan.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Don't you know how to play the publishing game?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
You're supposed to take what you got and make it 10%

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
better or bigger, and then you publish a paper.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And then you take that and you make it 10% or 20% better,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and you publish another paper.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
You can milk this for a dozen papers.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And I said, no.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I'm not going to waste my time.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I'm not interested in the papers.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I want that one nugget of gold at the end.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I want a paper in science.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So I continued computing end game databases.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
They started in 1989.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
At various points, they were running on hundreds of processes

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
around the world.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And eventually, I computed up to all positions with 10 or fewer

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
positions on the board.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Let's see.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Not 1,000 or 1,000,000 or 1,000,000 trillion.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
39 trillion positions in the program's memory.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
If ever you do the analysis and you come down to 10 positions

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
or 10 pieces or less, you know the exact answer.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Win, loss, or draw.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Here's an example of the databases.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
This is a famous example.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's called the 100-year position.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
White to move and win.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
You don't care much about the position.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The point was this was posed in the year 1800.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And this is pre-internet.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Yes, there is something called pre-internet.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
But pre-internet days where this position was heavily

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
discussed in chess magazines.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
So somebody in the year 1800 published this and said,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I think white wins.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And like six months later in another magazine,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
somebody published an analysis that said, no, it's a draw.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And two years later in another magazine,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
somebody published an analysis and said it's win.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
This went on for 100 years back and forth in magazines

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
before they concluded it's a win.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Grandmaster Don Lafferty gave it to me and he said,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
you know, there's 10 pieces on the board.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
You should be able to look it up in your database.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
What's the result for the 100-year position?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
We looked it up and it's a draw.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And it turns out that on the third move of the analysis,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
black has to play an unhuman-like move.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And once Don Lafferty saw what it was,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
he went like this.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Now it's obvious it's a draw.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
But it wasn't obvious before because the computer

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
looks at everything and humans are biased.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It's now called the 197-year position because the first

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
publication was in the year 1800 and in 1997 we solved it.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Here's how we did the solving.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
This is 24 pieces on the board down to zero.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
The width here is the log of the search space.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
So you can see that it's pretty wide here

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.000
because the log is like two and then three and bigger.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And the widest is at 24 or actually 23 is the biggest size.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Whenever you get down to 10 pieces or less,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
we look it up in the database.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Here's the perfect information.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I had a master process that was maintaining the main line

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
of play.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
It would decide what pieces of work

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
needed to be done to prove or disprove whether a line of play

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
was good or not.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Each of those dots represents a piece of work.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I had hundreds of processors that would pick off pieces of work

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
like this one, grab it, do the work, send the result back,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
which would then update this picture.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And so for two years this process would continue

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
as we refined the strategy.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Processors working in parallel for two years.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
The longest line in the proof was 154 moves.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
At the end of it was a position that was searched

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
possibly more than 30 moves.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
At the end of it was a database position

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
which may have been searched to 250 moves deep.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
In other words, it's possible that the longest line

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
in the actual proof from the start of the game

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
to the literal end of the game was well over 400 moves.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And it was a smart search because I put a lot of effort

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
into refining the search algorithms.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Even though the search space was 10 to the 20th,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
we only had to look at 10 to the 14th positions

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
in order to do the proof.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Huge, huge reduction in search space.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I want to throw this in just as a warning.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
This was as much research in AI as it was in reliable systems

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
because you have to be careful of disk IO failures.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I mean, I told you I had a database full of null bytes.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
What the hell happened there?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I don't know.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Network failures, memory parity errors.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Somebody tried to reproduce my results

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and we got different results and we tracked it back

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and it turned out that in 1992 one of my computations

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
was correct and I had it on my disk.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And then six years later when I looked at it,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
one bit in the database had changed, one bit.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And it was wrong.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And all my computations that depended on that data since then

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
were now flawed and had to be redone,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
which meant every day I would do a verification

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
that the data had not changed.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And every few months you would find that a bit would be flipped.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It's perfectly normal.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It happens.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Discs are not 100% perfect.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
They're bugs and all sorts of other problems.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So if you want to say that you're proving something,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
you've got to be 100% correct,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
100% is a pretty high standard.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So, punch line.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Ta-da.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
And it's literally ta-da.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Because I wrote a script to do all of this

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
and if it ever reached the end of the script,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
it was to send me an email.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
And the email only said ta-da.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And I got an email one day saying ta-da.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So, here's the punch line.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
If neither side makes a mistake,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
then a game of checkers will end in a draw.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
So I now have a theorem that perfect play leads to a draw

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
and the proof is constructive.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I have a construction.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
The formal proof fits up on my web

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
and you can actually go through it and see the proof.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
But I have something that most people don't have

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
when they do a proof.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
My proof completed on April the 29th,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
2007 at 5.01 p.m. California time.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I was in California with my daughter and I had an urge.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I said, Rebecca, I need to check on the checkers computations.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I need to check in on the checkers computations.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
So we checked into a hotel

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
and I went up and hooked up my computer and logged in.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And was pissed off because all the computers were down.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And I was about to restart them when I looked at the log file.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
That was the time stamp.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
The computation had ended.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And what shocked me, you know I said I had this feeling

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I had to log in?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.000
The computation had ended one minute before I looked at this file.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Which meant I was literally online checking to see what was going on

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
within 60 seconds of the computation ended.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And what's even weirder, I'm in California.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
My postdoc who was working with me was in Edmonton.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
He had this funny feeling too.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And he logged in at the same time.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
And we were chatting back and forth within like two minutes

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
of the computation ending.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
It was absolutely bizarre.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So the corollary is that because perfect play leads to a draw

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
the corollary is that Chinook will never lose.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Never lose.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And so the implication is that Tinsley occasionally made a mistake.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Therefore being human I now know that my program is better than Tinsley.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Not the easiest way to do that.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Some recognition.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I published my paper in Science.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And Science and Nature Ranked.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
It was one of the top ten breakthroughs for 2007.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
New York Times ran a great piece in their year-end magazine

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
called The Death of Checkers.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And they have this picture that I love.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
It's meant to be humans being buried under my 40 trillion

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
data-based positions.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It's a great example.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Last word.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
This is from my wife.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And I don't know why I put this here because she doesn't know me well enough.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
She said it was 1989, 2007.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
But that's when we started competing.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
But it actually started in 1988.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
She said it's been 18 years.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Correct.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
This is not fake news.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Let's deal with facts.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
18 years.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Correct.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Obsessive compulsive behavior.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
That is not correct.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
There is nothing wrong with being passionate about a problem

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
and pursuing it for 18 years.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
That is not obsessive compulsive behavior.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Now this really hurt.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Not normal.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
The commitment to scientific purity.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
She did not understand how important it was

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
the standard to reach 100%.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Scientists are perfectionists.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
We want to leave our mark.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
But then she struck below the bell.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Get a life, Jonathan.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000
OK.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Well, I hate to say it, but you really didn't think

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I'd give my wife the last word, did you?

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
The other was the end of the project, but I lied.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I took my book from One Jump Ahead,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
which was Challenging Human Supremacy at Checkers.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And then I updated it and added the next 10 years

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
and it became One Jump Ahead Computer Perfection at Checkers.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And that came out in 2008.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
So this is a story.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It technically ends in 2008, but it doesn't end.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
There's rarely a week that goes by when I don't get

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.000
a computer scientist or a checker player or a media or whatever.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And it's only with hindsight that I can look back

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
and I say I went through an amazing experience,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
something that was life-altering to me

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
and has had profound implications for my life

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and how I live it.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And I feel privileged to have known Marion Tinsley

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and have gone through this obsessive compulsive quest.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
So thank you for your interest in my apologies for going over.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I have lots more stories and I just, you know,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
it brings back memories to give this talk.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I give this talk three, four times a year now still

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
and even some groups have asked me to give it again and saying,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
you know, you told us those stories last time.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
We want to hear new stories because there are lots of other stories.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So who knows?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So thank you very much.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
And, you know, please feel free to leave.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
You've been great staying as long,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
but I'm happy to stay around as long as necessary

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
and answer whatever questions you have.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Thank you.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Let's do a few questions at least and we'll see where it goes.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Questions? Yes, sir.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Do you want an update on the chess game?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Sure.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
They're still playing.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Is it a draw?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Okay.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
This is the match between American Fabiano Calrana

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
and Norwegian Magnus Carlsen for the World Chess Championship.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
It just happened to have started today.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
It's going on in London.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
The one move was a white to D4.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Yeah, not a surprise.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Yes.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
So when you're faced with, you know,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
a question that is massive is, you know,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
even just starting to write a program that could play chess

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
or it could play it candidly.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
What was, like, what are the first steps

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
of being taken?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
How do you approach starting a problem,

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
like picking out a problem like that?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Well, first of all, I didn't know it was going to be this big

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
of a problem, so I might have done it differently.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
And what I did is I just wrote actually a very simple program

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:48.000
to just play legal moves and display things

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
just to see how much work it was

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and whether it was interesting or not.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
If I was going to undertake anything big,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I had to do something that I thought was interesting.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So by just doing something really small,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
like just making moves on the checkerboard

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
was my interest still.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
You know, I've taken on a lot of projects

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
and I start programming them and then I lose interest

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
and then you never finish the code.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And so I need to do something with it

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
that keeps the momentum going

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
because the more you get involved with something,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
the more that you're going to end up putting into it

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
and I don't want to invest my time and effort

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
on something frivolous that I'm going to drop

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
a day, a week, a month later.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
And I've done a few of those things

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
and, you know, I've regretted the time.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I mean, we've done this and, you know,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I seem to be addicted to long-running projects.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Our poker project started in 1995

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
and ended earlier this year, so that's 23 years.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
So it even trumps the...

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Oh, I can't say that.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It even is longer than the checker's project, right?

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
So you've got to be not obsessive.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Determined.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And once I think something's worthwhile,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
then I'll pour my heart and soul into it,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
but I've got to get to the point where I see

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
that I want that commitment.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Yes?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Do you have anyone trying to challenge Chinook nowadays?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
No. I mean, it's perfect.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
So you can play Chinook, but you'll never win.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
We have Chinook online.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It goes on and off online

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
because the hardware we have right now

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
is getting old and failing, so I haven't replaced it.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And there are strong humans that continue to like to play against it,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
using it as a sparring partner.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.000
But, you know, the game is over from the computer science point of view.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
There's nothing interesting left to do.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Actually, that's not true.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
There is one thing interesting left to do,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
and that's, if you don't mind, I'll add some technical stuff.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Just one thing.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
This interests me, and this...

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Why does this interest me?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Well, Marion Tinsley, or any checker player, or chess player,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
they're really good at playing chess, or checkers,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
and they're not going to memorize 40 trillion positions.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
How do you play a game?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
You use heuristics.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
You know, in chess, you might say,

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
it's good to centralize my pieces,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
or I need to do king safety.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
You come up with heuristics,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
and I can explain a lot of those heuristics to you.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But if I ask, if I gave you a position

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
with four white pieces versus four black pieces,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
and I say, oh, you know, here it is in the database,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
it's a win.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And the human says, why?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I say, I have no idea.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
The program says it's a win.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So what I really want to do, and I'm going to try that this year,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
and I've tried before, and it's failed,

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
but with all the hype about deep learning,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I want to try deep learning on this,

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I want to see if I can take something like one of these databases

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
and run it through a learning algorithm

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
and try and compress it into a smaller number

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
of explainable heuristics

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000
so that I could use this to write a book.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
So you want to learn how to play the checker end games?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I have this program, I run it, and it will tell you

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
you should do the following things

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
if you're going to win the position.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
And I can't do that right now.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And so I've got a lot of data, but I have no knowledge.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And humans need knowledge, not data.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I'd love to be able to do that.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Yes, sir.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Like you said, no one's going to memorize 40 trillion positions.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000
So I guess my question is, what sort of long-term effect

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
do you think this will have on checkers at the highest level?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
They still play.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
But checkers is not so popular.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
It's a dying game now.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
If you look at the worldwide number of people in the American

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
and the checker federations, you're talking about

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
a few tens of thousands of people.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Whereas in chess, worldwide, you're talking maybe a few million people.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
So checkers has been dwarfed by chess

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
and checkers is not going to recover.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It's a fun game.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
It's a challenging game.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
The rules are very simple and elegant,

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
but it has not attracted people's attention.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
So that game is just slowly disappearing.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I guess to clarify, do you think that we can derive any benefit personally

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000
from solving these sorts of geometric puzzles like chess?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
What do you mean?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Research-wise, what are the outcomes

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
for solving something like that?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I'm just saying hypothetically, it's possible to solve the chess puzzle.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:12.000
So just using chess as the example, since it's the more popular of the two,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I guess I'm just wondering if this would make the world of chess a better place.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Solving it, I don't think it makes a difference.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I mean, we have superhuman chess playing programs and nobody cares.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
They use them as sparring partners.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
But solving chess would be interesting.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And solving checkers was interesting at one point.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Sorry, I'm just trying to get to here.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000
One of the effects of this is DARPA held two workshops

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
on solving games of national importance.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And this was because of the work that we were doing on chess and checkers,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
which were very large search spaces.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
And it turns out that a lot of real-world problems can be couched as games.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Politics is a game.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Military is a game.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Certain kinds of legislation laws, like environmental laws, can be couched as a game.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
The way animals interact is a game.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
The economy is a game.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Multiple players, imperfect information, things like that.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And DARPA was interested in how do we take games,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
like we'd solve the game of 10 to the 20th, which for 2007 is like a massive,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
is the biggest computational problem solved today.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And DARPA had done the work to take some real-world games

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
and try and express real-world problems and express them as games,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
and they were coming up with 10 to the 100th.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
So how do you get from solving games of size 10 to the 20th to 10 to the 100th?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Oh, it's only a factor of five, right?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
No, it's not a factor of five.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
It's much, much bigger than that.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
And so solving games, bigger games like chess would be amazing

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
because although the actual solving of chess,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
do we really care whether chess with perfect play is a draw or not?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
No. Do we care that checkers is a draw or not?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
No.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
It's about what are the techniques and the technologies

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
that you would allow you to get to solve such really hard and complex problems.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And again, like I said at the beginning,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I want to emphasize this is not about games.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
It's about general-purpose techniques that you can use for other applications.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
This one, my talk became much more personal,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
so there was obviously a large game component in my talk,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
but the end result had to be papers that were generally applicable.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Did I have it?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Most interesting result that has used my research.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Well, let me tell you one thing that was completely unexpected

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and it goes back to this slide.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So you look at that and you say, OK, it's a big number.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
But remember, we're talking about, years ago,

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
we're not talking about cheap gigabyte disks.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And how many what?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That's a billion, so we're talking about 39,000 gigabytes

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
or 39 terabytes.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Well, back then it was $5,000 for a gigabyte.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I'm not going to afford a terabyte.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It couldn't.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
So I spent a lot of time and effort,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
which has nothing to do with AI,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
in coming up with compression algorithms.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:57.000
So this whole stuff got compressed down to six gigabytes.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I had to invent new compression algorithms,

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
application dependent, massive amount of compression,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and then doing real time searching on it

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
because you're playing a game,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
which means you come across a business,

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
you got to go and you got to decompress part of the file,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
extract the information.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
You can't take a six gigabyte file and just unzip it

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
and then look up a position and zip it.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
But you can't.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So you got to take pieces and decompress them,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
pull things out.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And OK, fine.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
So I developed this technology and thought nothing of it

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
until a couple years after the Second Tinsley match

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
when two biochemists walked into my office and said,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
you know, we know what you did with the checkers program

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
and we think it has applications to bioinformatics.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Well, I don't know much about bioinformatics.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I hated my undergrad biology course.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And he said, well, let's not talk about checker positions

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
when lost draw.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Let's talk about the letters, ACGT, DNA.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Well, your database is just a string of wins, lost draws,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
but it could be ACGT.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And if we gave you large data, could you compress it?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Similarly, I said, well, yeah, we could try that out.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And he said, well, and if you have large data

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
and you compressed it, could we use some of your technology

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
to in real time go and search it and pull information out?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I said, sure.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
He said, OK, well, we're working on the human genome project.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
We're generating massive amounts of ACGT data

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.000
and we want to have these programs be able to analyze this data

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
in real time.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And instead of using big, massive data servers,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
we want this all compressed on something that somebody

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
could do something on their laptop.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Huh, we talked about it.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Within six months, we formed a company called Biotools.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And we developed three products, Peptool, GeneTool,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
and Chromotool, which did protein and DNA analysis.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And we sold those products to thousands of research labs

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
around the world.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000
And I was very proud of it that here was DNA protein analysis

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
software with checkers inside.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
And I never would have made that connection.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And so, yeah, we did it.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
We made a bit of money.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
We sold the company.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And in many ways, I'm proud of it because one of the major

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000
companies who did a lot of the DNA analysis used our software

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
and they were very complimentary about how much it helped

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
speed up their processes.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And so it's kind of an odd story.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
But you never know where technology is going to go.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
And that's cool.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I guess the other story I like, which was really good to me,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
is I've developed a lot of pathfinding algorithms.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And you go in and you publish them.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
These pathfinding algorithms can be used in GPS systems,

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
but I often use these examples in computer games.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And we develop an algorithm, a hierarchical pathfinding that

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
was very fast.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:16.000
And at a conference called AIID, Artificial Intelligence

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Interactive Digital Entertainment, which is on my mind

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
because we're hosting it next week in Edmonton.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
But at one of the conferences, one of the major computer games

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
companies, the guy comes up to me and says, yeah,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
we really like your hierarchical pathfinding.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
We use it for all of our pathfinding in games.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And I thought, wow, how cool is that that this multi-gazillion

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000
billion dollar company and my software, my algorithm,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
is in their products that sell 10, 20, 50 million copies.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I wrote Chinook.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
How many people in the world have ever played against Chinook?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Not many.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
How many people have played these games?

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Tens or hundreds of millions of people.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
And I thought, that's cool.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Now, how about a royalty that didn't get anything?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
That's part of the problem of being an academic is you publish

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
things and you never know how they're going to be used

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
and you never know if they're going to be used.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
But finally, when you get that kind of feedback,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
it's very, very rewarding.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Yes, sir?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I think it would be ironic if your compression helped

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
solve pancreatic cancer.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.000
The other question is, well, these long projects seem like

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
something you could only do after you got tenure.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000
How could anybody, I mean, how could you keep your

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000
department happy if you're just playing checkers all the time?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
So that's a good point.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I actually started this project in 88 and I did not get

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
tenure until 89, but that was close enough.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You raised a good point.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I kept my research group going and I had other projects

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
on the go, but this was my passion.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000
This is where I poured most of my time and effort into it.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
But the interesting thing is that the two years where I put

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
the most time and effort, which was 1992 for the first match

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
against Tinsley in 1994, which is the second match of the

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Tinsley, there I poured my heart and soul into those efforts

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
and there were almost no publications that year because

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
of doing this.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
And those are the only two years in my academic career where

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I got substandard evaluations because I wasn't publishing.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
It sort of reinforced the publisher paradigm.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
If you didn't publish, well, sorry, but I was doing something

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
that I felt was bigger and in the long run I was right.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
But you're absolutely right.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Most people can't commit to this type of thing at an early

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
stage of their career.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
It would be suicide.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Oh, sorry.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
It would be professional suicide.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I've got to be careful what I say, especially to graduate

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
students.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Yes, other questions?

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Thank you again.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Thank you.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Give you a small applause from the department.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Wonderful.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Thank you.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
My pleasure.
