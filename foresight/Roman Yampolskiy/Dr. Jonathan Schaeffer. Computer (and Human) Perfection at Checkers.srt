00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's a great pleasure for me to introduce today's seminar speaker, Dr. Jonathan Schaefer.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He's a world-famous expert on AI for games, games with AI, solving games, building world

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
championships, playing bots. They published a very famous paper on solving checkers.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's the punchline. Hey, you're giving away the spoiler.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We already got to get some tools for this.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He took a break and became a dean for about six years, so now hopefully we'll get him back on the side of science.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll let you tell us what you actually are.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Great. Thank you very much. I'm delighted to be here. Thank you very much for coming on a Friday afternoon.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know that you're here for the talk. The pizza wasn't irrelevant in your decision to come here.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is a very strange talk. It's not the kind of talk that you're used to having.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not going to go into much technical stuff. There are a few technical slides.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll be delighted to talk technical after the talk.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is a very deeply personal story. It's something that happened to me that I didn't expect to happen.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It affected me profoundly. This is a talk of stories.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll apologize in advance because what usually happens is story after story.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh my God, the one hour is up. The last part usually gets done very quickly and so my apologies.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There's an important lesson in this talk that I want to pass on to graduate students.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's about research because there's two kinds of research.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The first is the one that we're most familiar with. It's what I call inspiration.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's where you work and you think about problems and all of a sudden you get that aha moment.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The light bulb goes off and you've got the idea that's going to allow you to prove this theorem

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
or you've got this great idea how to make this algorithm better

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and you get that moment of inspiration and you're really pumped up and excited

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and you code it or you write it up and voila, you've got a paper or maybe you've got a thesis or whatever.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's the kind of research that we most think about.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But there's another kind of research which I call the perspiration research.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's the stuff that's really hard work.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It may not be as glamorous as inspiration. It may not be as exciting as inspiration

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but it's the kind of work that you have to do.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If you're working say in operating systems and you've got to build an operating system

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you might spend a year or two or three designing and building an operating system.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's a lot of perspiration before you get to the point where you can do the inspiration.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This talk is about perspiration.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This talk took 20 years to make.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There aren't a lot of projects which take 20 years worth of human and computing power in order to achieve.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me talk about games and AI research.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
First of all I want to be clear. I'm an artificial intelligence researcher.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When I was young I had a passion for games and I thought well I'm going to use games for my AI research.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's what sort of marked me throughout my career.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
My research has been applied to many other problems including scheduling, GPS, bioinformatics, all sorts of other things.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
When it comes to demonstrating the core ideas I like to use games and puzzles

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
because I can relate to an audience.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can explain it in terms that people can understand.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I like to use games as my experimental test bed but everything I do is much more general.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Games are just the way of illustrating the ideas.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you go back to the dawn of computing science, in fact if you go back even further

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
before computing science all the way back to Charles Babbage and his difference engine in the 1800s

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
people were thinking about building game playing programs.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's what Babbage wanted to do.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's what people like Alan Turing, one of the fathers of computing science, wanted to do.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When AI became a discipline in the late 1950s at the famous Dartmouth conference

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
building a high performance game playing program is one of the big grand challenges.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Could we do it?

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Today in 2018 we can look back.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We can talk about Success in Chess, 1997 with Deep Blue.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
By the way, the co-author of Deep Blue, one of the three co-authors,

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Murray Campbell, born and raised in Edmonton which is where I'm from.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He did his bachelor's and master's degree at the University of Alberta

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
which is where I'm from before going to Carnegie Mellon to do his PhD.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Part of our game's lineage includes Deep Blue.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Backgammon, Jerry Tassara in the late 1990s.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He doesn't have a University of Alberta connection but he used reinforcement learning

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
which is a very powerful technique which is developed by Rich Sutton

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
who was a professor at the University of Alberta.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Poker, it's a project that started in 1995 and in 2008 we went superhuman and two player,

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Limit Texas Holdem and so that was the University of Alberta success.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You may have heard in 2015 we solved two player Limit Texas Holdem

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and in 2017 and 2018 University of Alberta and Carnegie Mellon University

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
went superhuman in two player No Limit Texas Holdem.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's the game you see on TV.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And Go in 2016, computers went superhuman and again just to brag,

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the lead author on AlphaGo and AlphaZero, the programs that went superhuman.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The lead author is David Silver who did his PhD at the University of Alberta

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and the second lead was Azure Wang who did his postdoc there.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So we've done a lot of work in AI using games at the University of Alberta

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and our academic children and grandchildren have done a lot of work.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I was working in chess in the 1990s and I had one of the best chess programs in the world.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It tied for first in the world computer chess championships in 1986

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and a chance conversation with a friend said what happened with checkers?

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Everybody's talking about chess, what happened with checkers?

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Checkers is an interesting game, it's a simple but not so simple game

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
but it has all the same research opportunities as chess.

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So why weren't people looking at checkers?

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now this isn't really a talk about checkers, this is really a talk about man and machine

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and so I may use some checkers jargon but you don't need that to understand the talk.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So what happened with computer checkers?

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The first real game playing program was a checkers program developed in the early 1950s

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but in the late 1950s a fellow named Arthur Samuel who went on to work at IBM

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
for most of his career developed a checker playing program to play against humans

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and that's Samuel standing up.

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And in 1963 IBM sponsored a match, man versus machine,

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Samuel's checker playing program versus a fellow named Robert Neely.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now you have to think back to 1963 and use your imagination

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
because computers, this is not a computer in 1963, what is a computer?

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
A computer fills a half this room with vacuum tubes and spinning tape wheels

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
just like that of the Hollywood movies.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And in 1963 IBM's machines running Samuel's software defeated Robert Neely in a single game.

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Computer defeated man at checkers.

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Now I have this wonderful collection of articles from newspapers and magazines.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Computers defeat master Robert Neely at checkers.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Computers defeat US checkers champion.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Computers are as good as the world champion.

103
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Computers solved the game of checkers.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now let me be clear about the word solved.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Checkers has 5 times 10 to the 20th possible positions, 10 to the 20th.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You guys are computer scientists, that's a lot of zeros.

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have this wonderful, I wrote Samuel's family and got his unpublished autobiography

108
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and in 1959 he writes excitedly, I got this fantastic, I got access to this fantastic new IBM computer

109
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and that computer could do 15,000 additions per minute.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Now 15,000 addition operations per minute.

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're not going to get to 10 to the 20th in my lifetime or your lifetime or whatever.

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So he had very slow computers and what happened was this got exaggerated out of control

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
because this was a milestone in a time when people didn't know

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and didn't understand what computing technology was.

115
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This was the first demonstration, public demonstration of what computers could do.

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It wasn't the typical application which was like missile trajectories

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
which is what many of the early computers were done.

118
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And in 1968 Samuel's program played an exhibition match against the world champion

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and against the world championship challenger and the program got crushed.

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Eight games. So the program wasn't very good.

121
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And for the record nearly, he was not world champion caliber.

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He was not US champion.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He was not a master.

124
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He was, I can't remember which state now, was it Tennessee?

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He was the Tennessee State Blind Champion.

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And so he was a good casual player.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They played six games.

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The computer won one of the six.

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Nearly one, sorry, nearly won two.

130
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Three games were draws.

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Nobody remembers except the one game that nearly won.

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And so even despite what I'm saying here this was an incredible result

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
because Samuel actually invented reinforcement learning

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and although he didn't understand fully what he was doing

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
it was an incredible machine learning accomplishment.

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And so I got very interested in checkers because people ignored checkers

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
because Samuel had done all this work.

138
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So in 1989 I wrote my first research grant to say I want to try

139
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and build a world champion caliber checker playing program.

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And I was very angry when the research granting agency

141
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
denied my request for a research grant and had the following quote in it.

142
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay, I was lost already.

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So what this talk is about is realizing Samuel's dream.

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's man versus machine for the world checkers championship.

145
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We have two computers playing.

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
One of them I developed.

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
His name is Shanook.

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's a computer program.

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And the other is a human program, the Marion Tinsley model.

150
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It was a computer.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It was built in 1928.

152
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
One-of-a-kind model.

153
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There were no replacement parts built.

154
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So it was just literally one-of-a-kind.

155
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No replacement parts for that computer definitely was a problem later on,

156
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
as you'll see.

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay, so let's talk about the challenger for the world championship,

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Shanook.

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Started as a project in 1988.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I started playing around with it and well, it looked interesting.

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In 1989, the world computer chess championships were held.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They're held every three years.

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I co-organized them.

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They were in Edmonton.

165
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And I had expectations that my program would do well,

166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
but it didn't.

167
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It crashed and burned.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Some friends of mine at another group, Carnegie Mellon,

169
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
had a team called Deep Thought, which won the world championship.

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They later moved to IBM to become Deep Blue.

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And so I was so pissed off because I wanted to be world champion.

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And it turned out that in a couple of months,

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
there was going to be the first computer Olympics,

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
where games were going to be contested in it.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And over the span of two months,

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I wrote a checker playing program,

177
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and I went to the computer Olympics.

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And in 1989, my program, which I named Shanook,

179
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
won the computer Olympiad.

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Now, interesting thing about this program,

181
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
a little bit of technology.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
One of the things we built, which was amazing,

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
its performance was the four-piece database.

184
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Now, checker starts with 24 pieces on the board.

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Pieces get removed.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And eventually, you could get down to like one piece.

187
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And again, you don't need to know the rules,

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but if I have a piece and you don't have a piece,

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I win, you lose.

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But what we did is wrote a program that said,

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
let's enumerate every single position with one piece on the board.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And compute whether it's a win, loss, or draw.

193
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, if you only have one piece, you win.

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Done.

195
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But having done that, you can now do

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
what we call retrograde analysis, go backwards.

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's solve all positions with two pieces on the board.

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because when you analyze with two pieces on the board,

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
if one of them comes off, you're down to one piece,

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and you can look it up in your database.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So you look up at all the two pieces.

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Then you go to three pieces, which reduced to two.

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And then you go to four.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Now, I had seven million positions,

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and I built that database.

206
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And as the program would search, whenever it got in

207
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and its analysis came down to four pieces, it could stop.

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Look up in its database and know whether the position

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
was a win, a loss, or a draw.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And we won the Olympiad against other computer programs,

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and it was clear that the program played very well

212
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and that the databases made a big difference.

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So I was on sabbatical in 1989,

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and I started working on my program.

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And a checker playing friend who had seen the program said,

216
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
you know, I'd really like to see how you would do

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
in the US championship.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And I said, well, why do I want to do that?

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And he said, well, every two years there's the US championship

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and there's the British championship,

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and the winner of those events gets to play

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
for the world championship.

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So if you can get into the US championship,

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you're going to be playing against the best players

225
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
in the world because they're all trying to earn the right

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to play for the world championship.

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The problem is in the US championships there's three categories.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The master category, which is for the best players in the world,

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
masters, grandmasters.

230
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The majors, which is for the reasonably good players.

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And the minors, which is for the beginners.

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And I said, wow, that's kind of cool.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
If I could get into the masters category,

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
then I'd have a chance to play against world class players

235
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and see how we could do, right?

236
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I mean, I want to build a strong program.

237
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The problem was, how do I get in?

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's not like I can just walk in and say,

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I got a great program.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let me into the US championship in the masters, right?

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That'd be like me saying, hey, I think I'm a really great golfer.

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to go and play in the US open against Tiger Woods.

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ain't going to happen, right?

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So how do I get in?

245
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm fighting a battle because two years previously,

246
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
a commercial manufacturer, who I will not name,

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
said, oh, we have a checker playing program.

248
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We'd like to get into the US championship.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And people laughed at him.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The program went into not the masters,

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
not the major, to the minor section,

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
which is where all the beginners are.

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And you play 32 games in these tournaments,

254
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and it lost its first 31 in games.

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And in game 32, something very strange happened,

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and it won.

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And nobody will admit what happened,

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
except that the human opponent who lost

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
was very happy with his results.

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So people knew that this program was really pathetic.

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And so I had this battle.

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
How do I get into the master section?

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I arranged something.

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I said, OK, I'm going to be diabolical.

265
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I arranged a, quote, conference,

266
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
unquote, at the University of Alberta.

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I invited a grandmaster who people said

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
he was receptive to playing computers,

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
two grandmasters, and a master.

270
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And I brought them to Edmonton.

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I used my research money, which I didn't have for checkers

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
because that had been turned down.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I used my research money for parallel computing

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
because I was wink, wink, using multiple computers

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
to play checkers.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And I brought them there,

277
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and I had them play games against my program.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And over the span of a week,

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
they played 20 competitive games against my program.

280
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And the grandmasters won four games,

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
lost one, and there were 15 draws.

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And I was pissed off.

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I was so angry.

284
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We lost.

285
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And my colleague said, man, you are so competitive.

286
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
No, not really, but you are so competitive.

287
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You have no sense of perspective.

288
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I said, what do you mean, he said,

289
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you've been working on this program less than a year.

290
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You beat a grandmaster.

291
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You only lost four to one.

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How strong is the program going to be in a year?

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And he was right.

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Lots of bugs in the program.

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It was very impressive.

296
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So the checkers conference,

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
we had master level performance.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And we had the five piece databases,

299
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
149 million positions.

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Now, what I did is I got the grandmasters

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
to write letters to the American Checker Federation

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
saying, hey, you know, this program is really good.

303
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It shouldn't be in the minors.

304
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It shouldn't be in the majors.

305
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It'll compete in the masters.

306
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
One of the grandmasters said, it'll compete in the master.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It'll finish near the bottom,

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but it won't be embarrassing.

309
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It'll be respectable.

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And so I got these letters and I wrote away

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to the American Checker Federation.

312
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I said, let me into the masters.

313
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And I waited and waited and waited.

314
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I finally got a letter back.

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And they said, yeah, OK, you can get into the masters.

316
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It'll be a novel.

317
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It'll be interesting.

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It looks like you've got something

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that at least will be entertaining for us.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I said, fantastic.

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That was great.

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And I thought, boy, I'm really surprised

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
they didn't write more.

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But OK, I'll take it.

325
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's great.

326
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And then like a week later, I got another letter.

327
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And I thought, OK, they figured out what my strategy was.

328
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And I read the letter and it said, oh, by the way,

329
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
if you're not allowed to win any money.

330
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
OK, you know, we're not going to win any money.

331
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And even if we did win money, you know, we wouldn't take it.

332
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
In fact, I wrote them back and I said, look,

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
we don't want any money.

334
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But in order to make this easy, we'll even offer a prize

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
for whoever plays the best game against the computer

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to get prize money.

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It turns out they were actually worried

338
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
we were going to win any money because there was

339
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
a $1,000 prize for the best junior player

340
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
under 18 years of age.

341
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And they were afraid that I would claim my program was

342
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
one year old.

343
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So they said, OK, fine.

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And then a week later, I got another letter.

345
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh, you can't win any money and you're not

346
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
allowed to win any trophies.

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's fine.

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't need trophies.

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's OK.

350
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And I waited and waited.

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I expected one more letter, which I never got.

352
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Who cares about the money?

353
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Who cares about the trophy?

354
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The real prize was if you won the tournament,

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
you got the challenge for the world championship.

356
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They never thought about it.

357
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They never wrote a letter.

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And so we went to the US championships in the summer of 1990

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
not being allowed to win any money or trophies

360
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and nothing else.

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So we had a surprise.

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The week before the US championship,

363
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
it was held in Tupelo, Mississippi.

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Do not go to Tupelo, Mississippi in August.

365
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Besides being hot, it's Elvis Presley's birthplace.

366
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And August is the anniversary of his birth.

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And the whole city is Elvis crazy.

368
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So, well, we had a big surprise.

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We went to the Mississippi state championship.

370
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
16 games, first place, undefeated.

371
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And why that's amazing is because several of the grandmasters

372
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
had come early for the US championship

373
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and they were playing.

374
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
We beat them.

375
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We didn't lose a single game.

376
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What people didn't understand is that the program was

377
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
incredibly strong since the checkers conference

378
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
because we now had the six piece databases,

379
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
2.7 billion positions, and a whole bunch of bugs fixed.

380
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And this made a huge, huge difference.

381
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
By the way, 2.7 billion positions,

382
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
it was really stretching my research

383
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
grant capabilities at the time.

384
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Remember, this is 1990.

385
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We're talking about billion.

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Billion is a small number today.

387
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But in 1990, it was big.

388
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I had to scrounge money to get my first

389
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
one gigabyte disk, $5,000 plus tax and shipping.

390
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
One gigabyte, 1990.

391
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So, computing 2.7 billion positions was a huge task in 1990.

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
People were shocked that we won this.

393
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And the next week, we went into the US championship.

394
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And all the best players in the world were there,

395
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
except for one.

396
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But most importantly, the world champion,

397
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Marion Tinsley, was also there.

398
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And the program started slowly.

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It was drawing game after game.

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Why?

401
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We'd been winning.

402
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Why were we drawing?

403
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It turned out that, of course,

404
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
playing in the Mississippi State Championship,

405
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
all of a sudden people said,

406
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
this program is really good.

407
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So they played really cautious draw checkers

408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
because they wanted to escape with draws.

409
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And halfway through the tournament,

410
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm so frustrated because we're drawing

411
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and not winning enough games.

412
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But I put something in which I called the fudge factor.

413
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It was just, you know, we've got to do something.

414
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So I put in a very simple line of code

415
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that penalized the program for reducing

416
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
the number of pieces on the board.

417
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The idea was that the more pieces on the board,

418
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the more complex the position was,

419
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and the more complex it was,

420
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
the higher the probability the human would make a mistake.

421
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So if the program started exchanging pieces

422
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
to reduce the number of pieces, it got a penalty.

423
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And so all of a sudden, like overnight,

424
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
the program became a monster

425
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and started winning and winning and winning.

426
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And after 24 games, we're now in second place.

427
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
First place is the World Champion.

428
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And in the seventh round, a four-game match,

429
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
we had to play the World Champion.

430
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This was the first time in history that a human

431
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
and a computer played a match that was not an exhibition match.

432
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This was the real thing.

433
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Tinsley had to play us or forfeit.

434
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
First game of the match turned out to be a classic.

435
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
First of all, there's the World Champion.

436
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
There's me.

437
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We're playing against each other.

438
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And there's this ring of players,

439
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
two, three, four, deep around watching,

440
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
because I remember one checker player saying,

441
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I want to see Tinsley spank the computer.

442
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
They wanted to see Tinsley beat this upstart computer

443
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
because it hadn't lost.

444
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I'm not a checker player,

445
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
so I live and die based on the evaluation

446
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
that the computer gives me.

447
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's like the stock market.

448
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The number goes up, you're happy,

449
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and the number goes down,

450
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and you're wondering, what do you do?

451
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We're 10 moves into the game,

452
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and the computer says it's equal,

453
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
maybe a small advantage to the computer,

454
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and I'm sitting there thinking pretty smugly,

455
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
this is great, World Champion,

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
10 moves in, we're invincible.

457
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And then he played a move that sacrificed the checker.

458
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And the moment he made the move,

459
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
you could hear the chuckles in the room.

460
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Because for a human, this was an obvious move,

461
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and it gave Tinsley an incredibly strong position.

462
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And within a minute or two of him playing this move,

463
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
all the spectators disappeared

464
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
because in their mind, the game was over.

465
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And I'm sitting there thinking,

466
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
we just were out to check her up,

467
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Chinook is happy, we're going to win,

468
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
this is great.

469
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Then a couple moves later, we're up a checker,

470
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the position's even, this is still great.

471
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And a few moves later, we're up a checker,

472
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Tinsley's got an advantage, that's all great.

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And a few moves later, things look really bleak.

474
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And we're playing on, and an hour goes by,

475
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and a few players start coming back,

476
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
looking what's going on.

477
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And more time goes by, and more people come by and watch.

478
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And then finally, Tinsley reaches out,

479
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
stops the clock, extends his hand,

480
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and offers a draw.

481
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It turns out, Tinsley's sacrifice was sound.

482
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
There was a very long and narrow path to a win.

483
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
He could have won the game.

484
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And he made most of the moves correctly,

485
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and then at the end, he slipped up,

486
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and it became a draw.

487
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The next three games against Tinsley were uneventful,

488
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and they all ended in draws.

489
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We had just drawn a four-game match

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
against the world champion.

491
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
In the last round, we were paired against the world's

492
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
number two player, Don Lafferty.

493
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We won a game, we drew three,

494
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Tinsley won his match,

495
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and the end result was that Tinsley finished first,

496
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Chinook finished second,

497
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and the rules of the competition were that

498
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the first-place finisher was challenged

499
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
for the world championship,

500
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and if the first-place finisher was the world champion,

501
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
that right went down to the second-place finisher.

502
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So in the summer of 1990,

503
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Chinook became the official world championship challenger.

504
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The first thing I did after this is I tried to find

505
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Arthur Samuel and tell him what had happened,

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and he had left IBM long ago.

507
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It turns out he had moved to California,

508
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
who's at Stanford University,

509
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
working for Donald Knuth on tech.

510
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm sure you're all familiar with tech, or lay tech.

511
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's a variant system,

512
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
and it turns out, much to my shock,

513
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
like three days before we won the right to play

514
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
for the world championship, Samuel had passed away.

515
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It turns out he, in the last years of his life,

516
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
had been suffering for Alzheimer's disease.

517
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He liked to claim he was the world's oldest programmer.

518
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Up to age 90, he was going in every day to

519
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Stanford University writing code

520
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
for the development of the tech system,

521
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and it just seemed ironic that we finally realized

522
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
his dream, in some sense,

523
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and he passed away just as that was happening.

524
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
All right.

525
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Let's talk about the champion.

526
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Marion Tinsley.

527
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
1950, he was the up-and-coming favorite

528
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to win the U.S. championship,

529
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
play for the world championship, and win it.

530
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
In 1950, he's playing in the last round

531
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
for the U.S. championship.

532
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
In a winning position,

533
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
he had a one-move oversight,

534
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and blundered, and lost the game,

535
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and he didn't finish first,

536
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
which means he didn't play for the world championship,

537
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and he was stunned.

538
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Everybody was shocked.

539
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He disappeared for two years.

540
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
He came back in 1952 and he won everything,

541
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
including the right to play for the world championship,

542
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
went to the world championship, and won it.

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
In 1958, he won the world championship,

544
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
or defended his world championship,

545
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and then he retired.

546
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
He said, you know what?

547
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't need this anymore.

548
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He went and finished his Ph.D. in math

549
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
at Ohio State University.

550
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Friends convinced him to come back in 1970.

551
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He won the U.S. championship,

552
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
was going to play for the world championship,

553
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
but the world champion was ill.

554
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He had a heart attack.

555
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Tinsley said, I don't want to play him,

556
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and so he went back into retirement.

557
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In 1975, the world champion at the time died.

558
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Tinsley was convinced to come back.

559
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
He won the U.S. championship,

560
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
he won the world championship,

561
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
played it, held it until 1991 when he retired.

562
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If you go back to that fateful game in 1950,

563
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and look what he did between 1950 and 1991,

564
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
he finished first in every tournament he played in.

565
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Not shared first, first.

566
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
He played multiple matches,

567
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
including for the world championship,

568
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
and he won them, usually by a wide margin.

569
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And he literally crushed the opposition.

570
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So early on, I called Mary and Tinsley a human computer.

571
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, there's some truth in that.

572
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Is this man or machine?

573
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Because from the period 1950 to 1992,

574
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Tinsley only lost three games of checkers.

575
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Three games of checkers out of thousands that he played.

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You don't think of humans being that good.

577
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You think of machines having that level of perfection.

578
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
If you ever asked Tinsley how many games he lost,

579
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
he would shake his head sadly and say it was five.

580
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Five. Why was it five?

581
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, Tinsley often gave exhibitions,

582
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
so somebody would organize,

583
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
like you're going to play 40 people at a shopping mall,

584
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
you're going to play them all simultaneously,

585
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
well, once at a shopping mall,

586
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
while playing 40 people simultaneously in a winning position,

587
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
he inexplicably made a one-move blunder and lost.

588
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I asked Grandmaster Don Lafferty

589
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
for many years the world's second best player

590
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
if he'd ever beaten Tinsley,

591
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and the answer was yes, once.

592
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
On a Saturday night, late at night,

593
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
after we'd both had far too much to drink.

594
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That was the only time Lafferty ever beat him.

595
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Five losses over 40 years.

596
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Basically, Tinsley's computer brain,

597
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
there was a neuron up there that misfired about every 14 years,

598
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
causing him to make a one-move blunder and lose a game.

599
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
There's only one recorded game where he got outplayed.

600
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This man was more a machine than man.

601
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So, prelude to the match.

602
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
We had just earned the right to play Tinsley

603
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
for the world championship.

604
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What do you think the first thing Tinsley does?

605
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He phones me up and he says,

606
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
hey, let's play a fun match.

607
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What? The world champion wants to play a fun match?

608
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
He says, yeah, sure.

609
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He's bored playing humans because he beats them.

610
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And so we wanted to test himself out against the computer.

611
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So we arranged for him, brought him to Edmonton,

612
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and we played a match, and he beat us 7.5 to 6.5.

613
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The first nine games were draws.

614
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
In the 10th game on the 10th move, something happened.

615
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The program says even.

616
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The program was flip-flopping between two moves,

617
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and at the last minute chose a particular move.

618
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
In the moment I made that move, Tinsley said,

619
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
you're going to regret that.

620
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And of course, I'm looking at the screen

621
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and it says the game is even.

622
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And a few moves later, Tinsley got an advantage,

623
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and a few moves later, he's better,

624
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and you know the whole story.

625
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We lost that.

626
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I was obsessed with that position.

627
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I've done the analysis to the point from when he said

628
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
you're going to regret that to the loss is 64 moves.

629
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And of course, I realized there's no way

630
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm going to write a program that's going to analyze that deep.

631
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I mean, the exponential growth is just enormous.

632
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It just brought home how deep he was thinking

633
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and he understood the game.

634
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So we ended up losing the match 1 win to 0, 13 draws.

635
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And again, being competitive, I was very upset that we lost.

636
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But the checker world was a gog,

637
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
like you only lost by one game against Tinsley.

638
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
That's incredible.

639
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Most telling was at the end of the match,

640
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Tinsley said, I feel like a teenager again.

641
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And I asked what he meant and he said,

642
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
playing against humans is boring.

643
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Everybody knows how good I am.

644
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And so they play drosh, boring games

645
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
because all they want to do is escape with the draw.

646
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Nobody tries to beat me because they're not going to beat me.

647
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Chinook had no respect for me.

648
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It would walk on the edge of a precipice.

649
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It would play loud, audacious, ridiculous moves, taunting Tinsley.

650
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And he loved it and it reminded him of the rambunctious games

651
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
that he played when he was a teenager,

652
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
when he was learning the game.

653
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And he said, I feel like a teenager again.

654
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I want to play the computer.

655
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Checkers is fun again.

656
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And so, well, we ran into problems.

657
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The American Checker Federation

658
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and the English Drafts Association refused to sanction the match.

659
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
They said, oh, computers can't play.

660
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This is the human world championship, they can't play.

661
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And I said, look it, we abided by all the rules.

662
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And they said, no you can't.

663
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And then Tinsley said, I want to play the computer.

664
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And the Checker Federation said no.

665
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And he wrote a public letter saying they deservedly came second.

666
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
They were very strong.

667
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I want to play them.

668
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The Checker Federation said no.

669
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So he said, OK, I resign.

670
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No need the world championship, the world title.

671
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And then he immediately signed on to play as a match.

672
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The Checker Federations were agogged.

673
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
How can you have Tinsley not being the world champion?

674
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But he refused to take the title back.

675
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And so they gave him the title world champion emeritus.

676
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And so they created a world man machine championship for the best man,

677
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
which was Tinsley, the best machine, which was Chinook.

678
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And in August 1992, we went to London to play for the World Checkers Championship.

679
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And there we are, the Park Lane Hotel.

680
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Nice 3D visualization board.

681
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You can't see it very clearly, but every time a move was made here on the computer,

682
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
there was a group up here, big audience.

683
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Checkers is very popular, or drafts as it's called in the UK.

684
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And so we had packed rooms for all of the games.

685
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So match starts and the first thing, the first day was terrible.

686
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Tinsley pressed hard in game one.

687
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And I thought we were going to lose.

688
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And I'm sitting on stage and I'm sweating.

689
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
All the media is there.

690
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I mean, this was a big event.

691
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Think Deep Blue.

692
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And I'm sitting there, please, don't let me lose on day one.

693
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Please don't let me lose.

694
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And I thought we're going to lose.

695
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And then all of a sudden, the program found its way into a draw.

696
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And I knew we were safe.

697
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We now had the seven-piece databases and a few of the eight-piece,

698
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
37 billion positions in the database.

699
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And the program had found a path from the current position into a drawn database position.

700
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I offered Tinsley a draw.

701
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
He declined.

702
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So we played on a few more moves.

703
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And I offered Tinsley a draw again.

704
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And he declined.

705
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We played on a few more moves.

706
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I offered him again.

707
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And he declined.

708
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And I said, look, Marion, we're in our databases.

709
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's a draw.

710
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You can play as long as you want, but we're not going to lose.

711
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And he was stunned.

712
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
He was sure he was winning.

713
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So he immediately shook hands and we went on to the next game.

714
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Tinsley won game five.

715
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
He played better.

716
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And he was winning in game seven and couldn't.

717
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Again, the program made his life complicated and we saved it.

718
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And so clearly after the first few days of the matches,

719
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the consensus looked like we were going to get crushed.

720
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm full of stories and I'm going to run late.

721
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But I have to tell you this story here because this is very important.

722
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
About halfway through the match, I got an email from back home.

723
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And all it said was database failure.

724
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Uh-oh.

725
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I was computing databases.

726
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And in the rush to get to the match,

727
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I knew that the more databases made the program stronger.

728
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Half the time was spent computing the database

729
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and the other half was spent verifying it.

730
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So about a couple months before the end,

731
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
before we went to London, I made the decision

732
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm going to stop the verification because I want more databases computed.

733
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll take a gamble.

734
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And now that I'm in London playing the match,

735
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I said okay, I'll start the verification running

736
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
because it's too late to compute any more databases.

737
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And of course one of the databases failed and sent me an email.

738
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But there's nothing I can do it.

739
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm in the middle of the match.

740
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Nothing I can do.

741
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
After the match was over, this took place in August and September.

742
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I finally got back home and had some free time

743
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and I started looking what happened with the databases.

744
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And I tracked it down to a database.

745
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
The database was there.

746
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It was the right size, everything.

747
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The contents were all zero.

748
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The file was just full of null bytes.

749
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But in my compression scheme, a zero meant draw.

750
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So if you ever got into that database,

751
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
it didn't matter what position, it was all draws.

752
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Guess which database it was.

753
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It turns out that in the game we were in a drawn position.

754
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And if Tinsley had kept playing,

755
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it's possible we would have moved to a position

756
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
that was actually a loss.

757
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And of course I told him information that was actually wrong

758
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and we did draw the game and we were never in a losing position

759
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
but had he kept playing, it's possible we could have lost that.

760
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So very scary.

761
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So we're down one to nothing.

762
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Now, game eight.

763
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Game eight starts and we had prepared the program

764
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
with some complex moves and it's a try and put Tinsley on his own.

765
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And in game eight, an opening came up

766
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
that we were able to play a move that was quite complex

767
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and everything went well.

768
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Until about move 12, when Tinsley made a move

769
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and Chinook suddenly said,

770
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the game is no longer even, we have a small advantage.

771
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And a few moves later, the advantage got bigger.

772
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And a few moves later, the advantage got bigger.

773
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And my eyes started bugging out.

774
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm on the stage and I'm sitting there

775
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
trying to hold in my excitement.

776
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And I got bigger and bigger and bigger.

777
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And then finally, Tinsley reached out his hand

778
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and resigned.

779
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And I was stunned.

780
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And the crowd rushed up and surrounded us.

781
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
All excited and everything because it had been an exciting game.

782
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And they all started congratulating Tinsley.

783
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And okay, I understand giving sympathy,

784
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
but hey, we won, this is like, we beat Tinsley.

785
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
This is big news.

786
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And everyone's congratulating Tinsley

787
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and I didn't understand what was going on

788
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
until the match arbiter, Con McCarrick,

789
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
goes over to Tinsley and shakes his hand and said,

790
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I, Narian, that was a beautiful draw.

791
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
The depth of the games was such that people in the audience

792
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
didn't understand that Tinsley had resigned.

793
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They thought it was a draw.

794
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And Tinsley had to correct them.

795
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And then they were stunned.

796
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
One of the reporters at that,

797
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
because this was the last game of the day,

798
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
one of the reporters, I don't remember which media outlet was there,

799
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
the end of the day, he just ran out and filed his story.

800
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And of course the next day he says,

801
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
yeah, the games were all draws.

802
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
He had no idea that we had just made history.

803
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Now, what do you do after you beat Tinsley?

804
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It was like a dream of mine to beat Tinsley.

805
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I mean, I had asked Laine in bed,

806
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
just fantasizing about beating Marion and Tinsley.

807
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
My wife looked at me sadly once while we were lying in bed

808
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and she said, you're thinking about him again, aren't you?

809
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I mean, what would you do if you finally beat Tinsley?

810
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I thought I'd go out and party and buy a round for everybody,

811
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'd get drunk and whatever.

812
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And me and my team, we went out that night and it was like a wake.

813
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We were truly sad.

814
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Over the few years we'd known Tinsley, we'd come to respect him

815
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and we knew how painful this defeat was

816
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
and how upset and angry he was that losing.

817
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And we felt a little bit of humanity ourselves

818
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
because we knew this was a milestone

819
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
that computers are now beating the very best humans at checkers

820
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and if not checkers, eventually it would be chess.

821
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And so it was a very sad event.

822
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And that night, you know, I got back to my hotel room

823
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
and at three in the morning a reporter phoned me up

824
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and I poured out my heart and soul to this reporter how upset I was.

825
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Lesson, do not pour your heart and soul out to a reporter

826
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
because guess what appears the next day in the paper

827
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
is a lot of things that you probably didn't want to say.

828
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It was actually pretty upsetting and I learned a lot about myself.

829
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And so in Game 8 we won.

830
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It was the first time a computer had defeated a world champion

831
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
in any game that was a non-exhibition game.

832
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The next few games were draws

833
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and in Game 14 it happened again.

834
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
He must have made an inferior move

835
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and the advantage went up, up and up

836
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and then the computer froze.

837
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And I'm panicking.

838
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It stopped. What's going on?

839
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I had to leave my seat and go behind the curtains

840
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
where the computer was to take a look at the screen.

841
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
What's going on? Oh my, we've crashed. Something's wrong.

842
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
No. The computer had searched all the way to the end of the game,

843
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
had looked at all the scenarios,

844
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
it knew it was winning in every possible scenario.

845
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
There was nothing left to compute.

846
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So it had stopped.

847
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And a few moves later, Tinsley resigned and we won.

848
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We were in up two to one.

849
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That night I had no problems.

850
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We went out and we partied.

851
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We had a great time.

852
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We were up two to one against the unbeatable Tinsley.

853
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Fantastic.

854
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
On the way back home that night

855
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I turned to my colleague and I said,

856
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
do you think it's possible?

857
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Do you think we're going to beat Tinsley?

858
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Wish I'd never said that.

859
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Okay.

860
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
This is

861
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the most painful day of my life.

862
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
August 23, 1992.

863
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's game 18.

864
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
We're on move 17.

865
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Chinook has a big advantage

866
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and I'm sitting there on stage thinking,

867
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
actually sorry, let me go back.

868
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm jumping ahead.

869
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I did first thing in the morning what I always would do.

870
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Get up early, go down to the room,

871
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
make sure, you know, run the diagnostics on the computer,

872
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
make sure everything's okay.

873
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Get down to the room,

874
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
unlock it, open the doors,

875
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and I'm blasted by heat.

876
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It was a small room and it was hot,

877
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
really hot.

878
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What was wrong?

879
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Well, you see, it's hard to get good help these days.

880
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The hotel staff in the evening were supposed to

881
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
turn off the lights in the room

882
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and turn on the air conditioning.

883
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Off, on.

884
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
What they instead did is turn the lights on

885
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
and the air conditioning off in a small sealed room.

886
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So it was really hot.

887
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And when they opened the door,

888
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
the heat flooded out into the main room

889
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
where everybody would sit.

890
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And so the first game that day was postponed for an hour

891
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
because the embarrassed hotel staff

892
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
had to go out and rent fans to try and cool the room down.

893
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And so game 17 was played this Saturday morning

894
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and we played it and we were sitting up on stage,

895
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
which was even hotter.

896
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And after five moves, Tinsley just said,

897
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
look, I'm uncomfortable, I'm sweating.

898
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
This is ridiculous.

899
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Let's just agree to a draw and take a break.

900
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And I said, I'm up with it.

901
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So game 17 was like a quick draw, done, finished.

902
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
We're off the stage, spectators were disappointed.

903
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But there was another hour break

904
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
while we cooled the place down.

905
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Then we started game 18.

906
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Move 17.

907
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Chinook's got a nice advantage.

908
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
And I'm sitting there on stage thinking, ha, ha,

909
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
this Tinsley guy, he's not so good.

910
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We've got a big advantage.

911
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
We're probably going to win.

912
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Fantastic.

913
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Great.

914
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And then the computer comes up and says,

915
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
beep, Tinsley database.

916
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I thought, oh, darn.

917
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I had put into the program's databases

918
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
all of the games that I could find that Tinsley had ever played.

919
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And so when the Tinsley database message came up,

920
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
it found a way to go from the current position into a game

921
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
that Tinsley had previously played.

922
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And Tinsley had this incredible memory.

923
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
He knew every single game that he'd ever played.

924
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And I knew his memory was amazing.

925
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And so I knew, even though the program said,

926
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
we were really, really in a good position,

927
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I knew that we were going to draw it

928
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
because he would know this.

929
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And I'm sitting there on stage

930
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and just waiting for the program to move.

931
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Draw me my fingers.

932
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
We had about 40 minutes left on our clock

933
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
to get to move 20.

934
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So you have to play 20 moves in an hour.

935
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We're at move 17.

936
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So we only have three moves to make.

937
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And we've got 40 minutes.

938
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And the clock takes by.

939
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And I'm dreaming, we're going to be up three to one.

940
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
This is going to be fantastic.

941
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Man, just think of all the good things that are going to happen

942
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
with this milestone event.

943
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Hmm, it's been 20 minutes.

944
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's a long think.

945
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Wait a minute.

946
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
The program actually has a hard stop of 20 minutes for a move.

947
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We're really over 20 minutes?

948
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah, we are.

949
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
How could that be?

950
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And 20 minutes became 25 minutes.

951
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And then 30 minutes.

952
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm sitting there on stage.

953
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You've got all of the media there.

954
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You've got a couple hundred spectators.

955
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
During a game, I can't interfere in any way.

956
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
The program has to make the moves.

957
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I'm just the operator.

958
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And I sat there panicking because the program is just

959
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
computing, computing, something's going on.

960
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And I watched there helplessly as the minutes ticked off.

961
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And I watched the hour hand go around to the top

962
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and then click our one hour was up.

963
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
We did not make the 20 moves.

964
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
We forfeited.

965
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And so now, of course, what happens?

966
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Well, I tried to talk to the computer, but I couldn't.

967
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It was frozen.

968
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It had crashed.

969
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Something was wrong.

970
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Actually, it hadn't crashed.

971
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It was frozen.

972
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I had no idea how that happened.

973
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Tinsley was apologetic at winning this way,

974
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but now the match was 2-2.

975
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Nothing I could do.

976
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And it was just absolutely terrible.

977
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I spent that whole weekend trying to figure out what happened.

978
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Was there a bug?

979
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't know how to freeze the computer.

980
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I don't know how my checker program could have frozen

981
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
this 8-processor Silicon Graphics computer,

982
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
but somehow it became frozen.

983
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Was it a hardware problem?

984
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
The computer had been baked all night in this hot room.

985
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And I talked to Silicon Graphics and they showed me a paper

986
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
out where they took their 8-processor Silicon Graphics

987
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
computer out to Death Valley in California for a weekend

988
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and it correctly in parallel computed pi.

989
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And so therefore, you know, it works in really hot weather

990
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
that you can compute pi.

991
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Well, I said, you know, pi isn't like this.

992
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
We've got 8 processors, complex interactions,

993
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
a lot of message passing, a huge amount of disk activity

994
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
because you're reading the databases.

995
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It's not the same thing.

996
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Silicon Graphics said there was no hardware problem.

997
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Was it a hotel problem?

998
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I mean, it didn't happen any day before.

999
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It never happened again.

1000
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It only happened on this day when the computer got baked.

1001
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I have no idea what happened that day.

1002
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
But we forfeited.

1003
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And I spent the entire weekend at the computer

1004
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
working with it, testing it, trying to recreate the problem.

1005
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And I showed up Monday morning to play Tinsley

1006
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
and he was dressed as he usually is in a three-piece suit

1007
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and I had bags under my eyes and stubble on my face

1008
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
because I'd literally been up the whole weekend

1009
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
trying to figure out what was going on.

1010
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And to this day, I had no idea what happened except we lost.

1011
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
One of the most horrible experiences of my life

1012
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
was sitting on stage for the last half of that 40 minutes

1013
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
knowing that something is wrong,

1014
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
something helpless to do anything

1015
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
and listening to the audience,

1016
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
the audience talking in murmury.

1017
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
As it came closer and closer to the program forfeiting,

1018
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
you could just hear the people,

1019
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
what's going on? What's going on?

1020
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Why isn't it moving? What's happening?

1021
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And as the program ticked down to forfeiting,

1022
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
you'd just hear people go,

1023
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
what? Move! Do something!

1024
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And I'm on stage and I'm helpless

1025
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and there's nothing I could do and it's just burned into my head

1026
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and we lost.

1027
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
The next day, or a couple days later,

1028
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Tinsley accidentally won Game 25

1029
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and he paid us the sincerest compliment.

1030
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
He said, I've had a scare.

1031
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I'm now going to play drosh, boring checkers against you

1032
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
and I'm going to wait for you to make a mistake

1033
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
in Game 25 and he played dull, boring drosh checkers

1034
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
the west of the way and we never had a chance to win a game.

1035
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That was the ultimate compliment

1036
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
because he had criticized other players

1037
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
for playing that way against him

1038
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and now he was playing that way against us.

1039
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
In Game 39, we're down by one game.

1040
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
We need to win the game.

1041
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I set the program to have a draw being equal to a loss

1042
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
because a draw did us no good

1043
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and of course the program found a draw

1044
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
and would not take the draw

1045
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
because I'd set it to be a loss

1046
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and we kept playing trying to win

1047
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
and we eventually lost.

1048
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
The final score was 20.5 for Tinsley,

1049
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Chinook, 18.5.

1050
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
People were impressed.

1051
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It was a great result

1052
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
but it might have been different

1053
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
had it not been for Game 18.

1054
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
A couple weeks after the match,

1055
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
the nightmare started.

1056
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I started reliving Game 18,

1057
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
those final 20 minutes.

1058
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I'd wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat

1059
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
because I could hear the voices in the audience.

1060
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Why isn't it moving? What's going on?

1061
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It happened night after night after night.

1062
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
People told me I had an interesting story

1063
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
so I decided I had to write a book

1064
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and I wrote a book

1065
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
but I could not write about Game 18

1066
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
it upset me so much

1067
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and finally I had the whole book written

1068
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
except for this part

1069
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and I said I got to do it, I got to do it, I got to do it

1070
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and I sat down

1071
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
and I wrote about Game 18.

1072
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Done. I never went back and edited.

1073
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Done. Finished.

1074
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And I never had the nightmares again.

1075
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
They stopped the next day.

1076
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Gone.

1077
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
If I had known

1078
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that this would be so therapeutic to write this out

1079
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and express my feelings and emotions,

1080
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I would have done it long ago

1081
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
but in the end I tortured myself by not writing it.

1082
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Anyway, the book came out in 1997.

1083
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
One jump ahead challenging human supremacy in checkers

1084
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and I'm very proud of it.

1085
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's not technical, it's this talk that I'm giving.

1086
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It's this and many other stories.

1087
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I wanted revenge

1088
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
so I had to spend two years waiting for a rematch in 1994.

1089
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
1994, deeper searching.

1090
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
We're going 17 to 29 moves ahead.

1091
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
What human can think compute that far but Tinsley could?

1092
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Improving our openings, improving our knowledge,

1093
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
improving our end games.

1094
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
We eventually computed all of the AP's databases.

1095
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
406 billion positions in the program's memory.

1096
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
The match was played at the computer museum in Boston.

1097
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
That museum has now moved to Mountain View, California.

1098
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And it went off to a very strange start.

1099
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
On the first day I phoned up Tinsley and I said,

1100
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
let's walk over to the museum together and he said, fine.

1101
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And we're walking over and he's unusually quiet.

1102
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And then he tells me something strange.

1103
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
First of all you need to know that Tinsley was also a Baptist minister.

1104
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
He was a very religious person.

1105
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And he talked many times about doing God's work.

1106
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And on the walk over he turns to me and he said,

1107
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I had a dream last night.

1108
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And he said, in that dream God told me that he loved you too.

1109
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That he loved Jonathan as well.

1110
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And I looked at Tinsley in shock because at times he sort of portrayed me as the devil, right?

1111
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And he's doing God's work to slay the devil.

1112
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And I looked at him in shock and he looked at me back

1113
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
and he shook his head sadly and I said, I know.

1114
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It was a very upsetting dream.

1115
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But this was so on Tinsley-like.

1116
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And then we played game one and it was a draw.

1117
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And then we played game two and Tinsley was in a lot of trouble.

1118
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And we thought he might lose it and in the end he squeaked out a draw

1119
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and it came to a critical position and after the game he told me

1120
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
and he said there were six moves in that position.

1121
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I knew that five of them lost and the sixth one I didn't know

1122
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
and I just put my faith in God and played the sixth move.

1123
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And it drew and I thought, boy this isn't like Tinsley.

1124
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
He's such a confident person.

1125
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
How could he just put his faith in God and make a move and not know?

1126
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Very strange.

1127
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
A couple of games later he asked me about Derek Oldbury.

1128
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Derek was the world champion because remember Tinsley had resigned.

1129
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Derek was now the world champion but he got no respect

1130
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
because he was nowhere near Tinsley's class.

1131
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And he knew that I'd played,

1132
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Chinook had played an exhibition match against Oldbury

1133
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
as preparation to play Tinsley and it was all secret

1134
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and unfortunately Oldbury died about a month before we played Tinsley

1135
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and Tinsley asked, well now that Derek's dead it doesn't matter.

1136
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Maybe you could tell me what happened in the match

1137
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and I said well we beat Oldbury, three wins, no losses, 13 draws.

1138
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And Tinsley said, hmm, Chinook plays Oldbury.

1139
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Oldbury dies.

1140
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Therefore Oldbury must have died of Chinookitis.

1141
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That is so funny.

1142
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
He dies of Chinookitis.

1143
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And I'm sitting there thinking, what's so funny about that?

1144
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
First of all his logic is terrible.

1145
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But second of all to tie Oldbury's death,

1146
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
well if you play Chinook you're going to die.

1147
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And so it was a very morbid discussion.

1148
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Anyway the first six games were all drawn.

1149
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Chinook's play was flawless.

1150
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Chinook looked bloody impressive.

1151
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
The next day I phoned Tinsley up and I said, let's go.

1152
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Walked together and he immediately said, sorry,

1153
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
let me suggest the unthinkable.

1154
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
He said, I'd like to resign the match and the title to Chinook.

1155
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And I said why?

1156
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And he said, well I had an upset stomach last night

1157
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I wasn't feeling well.

1158
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And I said, okay, you're not feeling well.

1159
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm sorry about that.

1160
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
We're going to postpone the games for today.

1161
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Really, I don't want to play.

1162
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Look, let's take you to the hospital.

1163
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
We'll figure it out.

1164
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Let's get you better and then we'll worry about the match.

1165
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And he said, fine.

1166
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So I took him to the hospital.

1167
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
He spent a whole day there.

1168
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
They did tests.

1169
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And because of the upset stomach the doctors gave him the okay

1170
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
but they wanted to do X-rays as a precaution.

1171
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I mean he was like 65, 66 years old.

1172
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And at the end of the day Tinsley was in a good mood

1173
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
and said, yeah, we'll play again tomorrow.

1174
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So I thought, dodged a bullet.

1175
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The next morning Tinsley says I resigned the match

1176
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
and the title and you can't do anything about it.

1177
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Done.

1178
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So what's wrong?

1179
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
He said I had my upset stomach again.

1180
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And I said, but you got your X-ray.

1181
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We're going to hear the results.

1182
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And he said, no, we're done.

1183
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
He was adamant we couldn't do it.

1184
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
But he agreed to postpone the announcement of the match

1185
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
until after the X-ray results were known.

1186
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So I went to the match site and told the rest of my team

1187
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
and we were all upset and we're sitting there

1188
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and the media is there and spectators are there.

1189
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
What do you do?

1190
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
We're all set up to play and there's no Tinsley

1191
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
and we're not going to announce that he's resigned

1192
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
because he agreed to postpone it.

1193
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What happens?

1194
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Tinsley shows up.

1195
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
What does he want to do?

1196
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
He wants to play checkers.

1197
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Not a game.

1198
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
He wants to analyze some positions.

1199
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So we sit there for an hour analyzing positions

1200
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and the match arbiter comes in and says, what the hell is going on?

1201
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I said, we're playing checkers with Tinsley.

1202
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And he said, the guy is apparently too sick to play the match

1203
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
that he's resigning.

1204
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
What's he doing here?

1205
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And I said, that's what he wants to do.

1206
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And he said, well, what were the results of the X-ray?

1207
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And I said, I don't know.

1208
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
He hasn't called.

1209
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So the arbiter goes up and says, why haven't you called

1210
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
about the X-rays?

1211
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And he says, well, I'll call now.

1212
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So he disappears and we're all sort of perplexed at his behavior.

1213
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Tinsley makes the phone call, comes back.

1214
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And I said, well, what were the X-ray results?

1215
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And he said, ah, they found a lump on my pancreas.

1216
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Yeah, no big deal.

1217
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
You see, bright and cheery.

1218
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Now, if it was me, I would have been scared to death.

1219
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
A lump on my pancreas, that doesn't sound good.

1220
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But the match officials sent him home because they're

1221
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
about to announce that he's too sick to play.

1222
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And you couldn't have somebody too sick to play sitting there

1223
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
playing checkers.

1224
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
He refused to continue.

1225
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And we won the world championship after six games,

1226
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
all draws on forfeit.

1227
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
What do you do when you're in Boston all set up for a world

1228
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
championship and you have nothing to do?

1229
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Tinsley said, why don't you bring in Don Lafferty,

1230
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
the world's number two player, and play an exhibition match?

1231
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
We were so upset.

1232
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
We just wanted to go home.

1233
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
We played Lafferty.

1234
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
We lost a game.

1235
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
We've gone like 150 games without a loss.

1236
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I've been so careful in testing the program.

1237
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
A couple weeks before, I found something wrong.

1238
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And I've been in a rush and I fixed it.

1239
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And I had an if statement, which had an and in it.

1240
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And it should have had an or.

1241
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And I hadn't tested it.

1242
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And we lost the game.

1243
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
We won another game.

1244
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Lafferty played boring checkers to draw every game.

1245
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So it was a drawn match and we retained the title.

1246
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So we win it on forfeit and we retain it with a draw.

1247
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
It was absolutely terrible.

1248
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Then the American Checker Federation and the English

1249
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Drafts Association threatened us with legal action.

1250
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Of course, there was a contract that said whoever wins

1251
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
the match is world champion, but they threatened us

1252
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
with legal action.

1253
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And then they wrote angry letters to my chair,

1254
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
my dean, my university president, and the media.

1255
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
There was an anti-Shanuk internet campaign.

1256
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It was a horrible time.

1257
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
In 1995, January, we played another match against Lafferty

1258
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
and we beat him.

1259
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
In April 1995, Tinsley unfortunately passed away.

1260
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It turned out that that lump on his pancreas

1261
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
was pancreatic cancer and he passed away.

1262
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And in 1996, Shanuk was crushing everybody.

1263
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Because nobody was even close to Tinsley.

1264
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
In the U.S. championship, there were 32 games.

1265
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It scored 30 out of 32 points.

1266
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Second place scored 22 out of 32 points.

1267
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I mean, the gap was so huge.

1268
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
It was a horrible time.

1269
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And we got lots of accolades which made things better.

1270
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
First computer to win a human world championship in any game.

1271
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It's from the Guinness Book of World Records.

1272
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
We're a trivial pursuit question, which is kind of cool.

1273
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
We're on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

1274
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
A popular game show from a few years back.

1275
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It was a $16,000, only $16,000 question.

1276
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Come on.

1277
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
But for me, there was still a sense of unfinished business.

1278
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I'm over time, so I will speed up and finish this talk.

1279
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
My apologies.

1280
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
But then I started getting all the hate mail

1281
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
from the checkers player.

1282
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Shanuk doesn't hold a candle to Tinsley.

1283
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
In his prime, Tinsley would crush Shanuk.

1284
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
You know, Tinsley was almost perfect.

1285
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
He did lose three games.

1286
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
He wasn't perfect.

1287
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And if I wanted to prove to everybody that my program was

1288
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
better than humans, I had to be better than Tinsley.

1289
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
If he was almost perfect, I had to be perfect.

1290
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So I had to solve the game of checkers.

1291
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There are some games that you can solve that are simpler.

1292
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
They have smaller search complexity or decision complexity.

1293
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Checkers is 500 billion billion positions.

1294
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That's a big number.

1295
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I'm sure you have no idea how to comprehend a number like that,

1296
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
but I'll give you a good example.

1297
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Let's take the Pacific Ocean.

1298
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And I know that you probably don't study oceanography,

1299
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
but if you go to the deepest part, there's actually a big plug there.

1300
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
And if you remove the plug and drain all the water,

1301
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
it's really a big sink, and you drain all the water

1302
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and it's empty and you put the plug back in,

1303
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
now your task is to refill the Pacific Ocean.

1304
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So we're going to give you a house in Seattle.

1305
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
You can turn on the tap and I'm going to give you a teaspoon.

1306
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
You can put the teaspoon underneath the tap,

1307
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
walk over to the Pacific Ocean,

1308
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
and dump the teaspoon into the Pacific Ocean.

1309
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
And then go back and fill another teaspoon with water

1310
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
and go over to the Pacific Ocean and dump it in.

1311
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
If you do it roughly this number of times,

1312
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
you will refill the Pacific Ocean.

1313
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'll leave that as an exercise for the ambitious student.

1314
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Basically, for a non-trivial game,

1315
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
checkers was 10 to the 7 times bigger than Awari,

1316
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
which had been solved.

1317
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So we're talking about 10 million times bigger.

1318
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And I said, I'm going to solve this problem.

1319
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And I'm going to do it.

1320
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And people said, well, why don't you do it incrementally,

1321
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
bits at a time?

1322
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I said, no.

1323
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
My goal is I want one fantastic paper in science.

1324
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That's my goal.

1325
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And then I got a review back saying,

1326
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
what a moron, Jonathan.

1327
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Don't you know how to play the publishing game?

1328
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
You're supposed to take what you got and make it 10%

1329
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
better or bigger, and then you publish a paper.

1330
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And then you take that and you make it 10% or 20% better,

1331
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and you publish another paper.

1332
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You can milk this for a dozen papers.

1333
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And I said, no.

1334
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I'm not going to waste my time.

1335
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm not interested in the papers.

1336
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I want that one nugget of gold at the end.

1337
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I want a paper in science.

1338
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So I continued computing end game databases.

1339
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
They started in 1989.

1340
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
At various points, they were running on hundreds of processes

1341
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
around the world.

1342
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And eventually, I computed up to all positions with 10 or fewer

1343
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
positions on the board.

1344
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Let's see.

1345
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Not 1,000 or 1,000,000 or 1,000,000 trillion.

1346
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
39 trillion positions in the program's memory.

1347
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
If ever you do the analysis and you come down to 10 positions

1348
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
or 10 pieces or less, you know the exact answer.

1349
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Win, loss, or draw.

1350
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Here's an example of the databases.

1351
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
This is a famous example.

1352
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It's called the 100-year position.

1353
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
White to move and win.

1354
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
You don't care much about the position.

1355
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The point was this was posed in the year 1800.

1356
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And this is pre-internet.

1357
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Yes, there is something called pre-internet.

1358
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But pre-internet days where this position was heavily

1359
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
discussed in chess magazines.

1360
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So somebody in the year 1800 published this and said,

1361
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I think white wins.

1362
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And like six months later in another magazine,

1363
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
somebody published an analysis that said, no, it's a draw.

1364
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And two years later in another magazine,

1365
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
somebody published an analysis and said it's win.

1366
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
This went on for 100 years back and forth in magazines

1367
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
before they concluded it's a win.

1368
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Grandmaster Don Lafferty gave it to me and he said,

1369
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
you know, there's 10 pieces on the board.

1370
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
You should be able to look it up in your database.

1371
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
What's the result for the 100-year position?

1372
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
We looked it up and it's a draw.

1373
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And it turns out that on the third move of the analysis,

1374
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
black has to play an unhuman-like move.

1375
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And once Don Lafferty saw what it was,

1376
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
he went like this.

1377
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Now it's obvious it's a draw.

1378
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But it wasn't obvious before because the computer

1379
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
looks at everything and humans are biased.

1380
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It's now called the 197-year position because the first

1381
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,000
publication was in the year 1800 and in 1997 we solved it.

1382
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Here's how we did the solving.

1383
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
This is 24 pieces on the board down to zero.

1384
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
The width here is the log of the search space.

1385
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So you can see that it's pretty wide here

1386
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
because the log is like two and then three and bigger.

1387
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And the widest is at 24 or actually 23 is the biggest size.

1388
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Whenever you get down to 10 pieces or less,

1389
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
we look it up in the database.

1390
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Here's the perfect information.

1391
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I had a master process that was maintaining the main line

1392
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
of play.

1393
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
It would decide what pieces of work

1394
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
needed to be done to prove or disprove whether a line of play

1395
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
was good or not.

1396
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Each of those dots represents a piece of work.

1397
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I had hundreds of processors that would pick off pieces of work

1398
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
like this one, grab it, do the work, send the result back,

1399
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
which would then update this picture.

1400
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And so for two years this process would continue

1401
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:48,000
as we refined the strategy.

1402
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Processors working in parallel for two years.

1403
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
The longest line in the proof was 154 moves.

1404
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
At the end of it was a position that was searched

1405
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
possibly more than 30 moves.

1406
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
At the end of it was a database position

1407
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
which may have been searched to 250 moves deep.

1408
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
In other words, it's possible that the longest line

1409
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
in the actual proof from the start of the game

1410
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
to the literal end of the game was well over 400 moves.

1411
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And it was a smart search because I put a lot of effort

1412
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
into refining the search algorithms.

1413
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Even though the search space was 10 to the 20th,

1414
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
we only had to look at 10 to the 14th positions

1415
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
in order to do the proof.

1416
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Huge, huge reduction in search space.

1417
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I want to throw this in just as a warning.

1418
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
This was as much research in AI as it was in reliable systems

1419
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
because you have to be careful of disk IO failures.

1420
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I mean, I told you I had a database full of null bytes.

1421
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
What the hell happened there?

1422
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I don't know.

1423
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Network failures, memory parity errors.

1424
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Somebody tried to reproduce my results

1425
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and we got different results and we tracked it back

1426
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
and it turned out that in 1992 one of my computations

1427
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
was correct and I had it on my disk.

1428
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And then six years later when I looked at it,

1429
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
one bit in the database had changed, one bit.

1430
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
And it was wrong.

1431
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And all my computations that depended on that data since then

1432
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
were now flawed and had to be redone,

1433
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
which meant every day I would do a verification

1434
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
that the data had not changed.

1435
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And every few months you would find that a bit would be flipped.

1436
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's perfectly normal.

1437
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
It happens.

1438
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Discs are not 100% perfect.

1439
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
They're bugs and all sorts of other problems.

1440
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So if you want to say that you're proving something,

1441
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
you've got to be 100% correct,

1442
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
100% is a pretty high standard.

1443
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
So, punch line.

1444
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Ta-da.

1445
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And it's literally ta-da.

1446
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Because I wrote a script to do all of this

1447
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and if it ever reached the end of the script,

1448
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
it was to send me an email.

1449
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And the email only said ta-da.

1450
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And I got an email one day saying ta-da.

1451
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So, here's the punch line.

1452
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
If neither side makes a mistake,

1453
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
then a game of checkers will end in a draw.

1454
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw.

1455
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So I now have a theorem that perfect play leads to a draw

1456
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
and the proof is constructive.

1457
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I have a construction.

1458
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
The formal proof fits up on my web

1459
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
and you can actually go through it and see the proof.

1460
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
But I have something that most people don't have

1461
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
when they do a proof.

1462
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
My proof completed on April the 29th,

1463
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
2007 at 5.01 p.m. California time.

1464
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I was in California with my daughter and I had an urge.

1465
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I said, Rebecca, I need to check on the checkers computations.

1466
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I need to check in on the checkers computations.

1467
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
So we checked into a hotel

1468
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
and I went up and hooked up my computer and logged in.

1469
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And was pissed off because all the computers were down.

1470
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And I was about to restart them when I looked at the log file.

1471
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
That was the time stamp.

1472
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
The computation had ended.

1473
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And what shocked me, you know I said I had this feeling

1474
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I had to log in?

1475
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:22,000
The computation had ended one minute before I looked at this file.

1476
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Which meant I was literally online checking to see what was going on

1477
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
within 60 seconds of the computation ended.

1478
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And what's even weirder, I'm in California.

1479
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
My postdoc who was working with me was in Edmonton.

1480
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
He had this funny feeling too.

1481
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And he logged in at the same time.

1482
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And we were chatting back and forth within like two minutes

1483
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
of the computation ending.

1484
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It was absolutely bizarre.

1485
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:56,000
So the corollary is that because perfect play leads to a draw

1486
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
the corollary is that Chinook will never lose.

1487
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Never lose.

1488
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And so the implication is that Tinsley occasionally made a mistake.

1489
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Therefore being human I now know that my program is better than Tinsley.

1490
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Not the easiest way to do that.

1491
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Some recognition.

1492
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I published my paper in Science.

1493
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And Science and Nature Ranked.

1494
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
It was one of the top ten breakthroughs for 2007.

1495
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
New York Times ran a great piece in their year-end magazine

1496
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
called The Death of Checkers.

1497
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And they have this picture that I love.

1498
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It's meant to be humans being buried under my 40 trillion

1499
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
data-based positions.

1500
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It's a great example.

1501
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Last word.

1502
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
This is from my wife.

1503
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And I don't know why I put this here because she doesn't know me well enough.

1504
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
She said it was 1989, 2007.

1505
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But that's when we started competing.

1506
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
But it actually started in 1988.

1507
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
She said it's been 18 years.

1508
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Correct.

1509
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
This is not fake news.

1510
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Let's deal with facts.

1511
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
18 years.

1512
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Correct.

1513
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Obsessive compulsive behavior.

1514
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
That is not correct.

1515
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
There is nothing wrong with being passionate about a problem

1516
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
and pursuing it for 18 years.

1517
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
That is not obsessive compulsive behavior.

1518
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Now this really hurt.

1519
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Not normal.

1520
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
The commitment to scientific purity.

1521
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
She did not understand how important it was

1522
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
the standard to reach 100%.

1523
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Scientists are perfectionists.

1524
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
We want to leave our mark.

1525
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
But then she struck below the bell.

1526
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Get a life, Jonathan.

1527
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
OK.

1528
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Well, I hate to say it, but you really didn't think

1529
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I'd give my wife the last word, did you?

1530
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
The other was the end of the project, but I lied.

1531
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I took my book from One Jump Ahead,

1532
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
which was Challenging Human Supremacy at Checkers.

1533
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And then I updated it and added the next 10 years

1534
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
and it became One Jump Ahead Computer Perfection at Checkers.

1535
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And that came out in 2008.

1536
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So this is a story.

1537
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It technically ends in 2008, but it doesn't end.

1538
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
There's rarely a week that goes by when I don't get

1539
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
a computer scientist or a checker player or a media or whatever.

1540
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And it's only with hindsight that I can look back

1541
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
and I say I went through an amazing experience,

1542
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
something that was life-altering to me

1543
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
and has had profound implications for my life

1544
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and how I live it.

1545
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And I feel privileged to have known Marion Tinsley

1546
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and have gone through this obsessive compulsive quest.

1547
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So thank you for your interest in my apologies for going over.

1548
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I have lots more stories and I just, you know,

1549
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
it brings back memories to give this talk.

1550
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I give this talk three, four times a year now still

1551
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
and even some groups have asked me to give it again and saying,

1552
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
you know, you told us those stories last time.

1553
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We want to hear new stories because there are lots of other stories.

1554
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So who knows?

1555
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So thank you very much.

1556
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And, you know, please feel free to leave.

1557
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
You've been great staying as long,

1558
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
but I'm happy to stay around as long as necessary

1559
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
and answer whatever questions you have.

1560
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Thank you.

1561
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Let's do a few questions at least and we'll see where it goes.

1562
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Questions? Yes, sir.

1563
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Do you want an update on the chess game?

1564
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Sure.

1565
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
They're still playing.

1566
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Is it a draw?

1567
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Okay.

1568
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
This is the match between American Fabiano Calrana

1569
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
and Norwegian Magnus Carlsen for the World Chess Championship.

1570
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
It just happened to have started today.

1571
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
It's going on in London.

1572
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
The one move was a white to D4.

1573
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yeah, not a surprise.

1574
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yes.

1575
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So when you're faced with, you know,

1576
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
a question that is massive is, you know,

1577
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
even just starting to write a program that could play chess

1578
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
or it could play it candidly.

1579
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
What was, like, what are the first steps

1580
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
of being taken?

1581
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
How do you approach starting a problem,

1582
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
like picking out a problem like that?

1583
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Well, first of all, I didn't know it was going to be this big

1584
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
of a problem, so I might have done it differently.

1585
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And what I did is I just wrote actually a very simple program

1586
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:48,000
to just play legal moves and display things

1587
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
just to see how much work it was

1588
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and whether it was interesting or not.

1589
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
If I was going to undertake anything big,

1590
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I had to do something that I thought was interesting.

1591
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So by just doing something really small,

1592
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
like just making moves on the checkerboard

1593
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
was my interest still.

1594
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
You know, I've taken on a lot of projects

1595
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
and I start programming them and then I lose interest

1596
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
and then you never finish the code.

1597
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And so I need to do something with it

1598
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
that keeps the momentum going

1599
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
because the more you get involved with something,

1600
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
the more that you're going to end up putting into it

1601
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
and I don't want to invest my time and effort

1602
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
on something frivolous that I'm going to drop

1603
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
a day, a week, a month later.

1604
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And I've done a few of those things

1605
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
and, you know, I've regretted the time.

1606
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I mean, we've done this and, you know,

1607
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I seem to be addicted to long-running projects.

1608
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Our poker project started in 1995

1609
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
and ended earlier this year, so that's 23 years.

1610
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
So it even trumps the...

1611
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Oh, I can't say that.

1612
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It even is longer than the checker's project, right?

1613
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,000
So you've got to be not obsessive.

1614
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Determined.

1615
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And once I think something's worthwhile,

1616
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
then I'll pour my heart and soul into it,

1617
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
but I've got to get to the point where I see

1618
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
that I want that commitment.

1619
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Yes?

1620
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Do you have anyone trying to challenge Chinook nowadays?

1621
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
No. I mean, it's perfect.

1622
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
So you can play Chinook, but you'll never win.

1623
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
We have Chinook online.

1624
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It goes on and off online

1625
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
because the hardware we have right now

1626
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
is getting old and failing, so I haven't replaced it.

1627
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And there are strong humans that continue to like to play against it,

1628
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
using it as a sparring partner.

1629
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But, you know, the game is over from the computer science point of view.

1630
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
There's nothing interesting left to do.

1631
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Actually, that's not true.

1632
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
There is one thing interesting left to do,

1633
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
and that's, if you don't mind, I'll add some technical stuff.

1634
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Just one thing.

1635
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
This interests me, and this...

1636
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Why does this interest me?

1637
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Well, Marion Tinsley, or any checker player, or chess player,

1638
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
they're really good at playing chess, or checkers,

1639
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and they're not going to memorize 40 trillion positions.

1640
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
How do you play a game?

1641
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You use heuristics.

1642
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
You know, in chess, you might say,

1643
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
it's good to centralize my pieces,

1644
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
or I need to do king safety.

1645
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
You come up with heuristics,

1646
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
and I can explain a lot of those heuristics to you.

1647
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But if I ask, if I gave you a position

1648
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
with four white pieces versus four black pieces,

1649
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
and I say, oh, you know, here it is in the database,

1650
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
it's a win.

1651
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And the human says, why?

1652
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I say, I have no idea.

1653
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
The program says it's a win.

1654
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So what I really want to do, and I'm going to try that this year,

1655
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
and I've tried before, and it's failed,

1656
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
but with all the hype about deep learning,

1657
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I want to try deep learning on this,

1658
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I want to see if I can take something like one of these databases

1659
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
and run it through a learning algorithm

1660
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
and try and compress it into a smaller number

1661
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
of explainable heuristics

1662
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
so that I could use this to write a book.

1663
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
So you want to learn how to play the checker end games?

1664
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I have this program, I run it, and it will tell you

1665
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
you should do the following things

1666
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
if you're going to win the position.

1667
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
And I can't do that right now.

1668
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And so I've got a lot of data, but I have no knowledge.

1669
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And humans need knowledge, not data.

1670
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I'd love to be able to do that.

1671
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Yes, sir.

1672
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Like you said, no one's going to memorize 40 trillion positions.

1673
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So I guess my question is, what sort of long-term effect

1674
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
do you think this will have on checkers at the highest level?

1675
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
They still play.

1676
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
But checkers is not so popular.

1677
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It's a dying game now.

1678
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
If you look at the worldwide number of people in the American

1679
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
and the checker federations, you're talking about

1680
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
a few tens of thousands of people.

1681
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Whereas in chess, worldwide, you're talking maybe a few million people.

1682
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So checkers has been dwarfed by chess

1683
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
and checkers is not going to recover.

1684
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's a fun game.

1685
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It's a challenging game.

1686
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
The rules are very simple and elegant,

1687
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
but it has not attracted people's attention.

1688
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
So that game is just slowly disappearing.

1689
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I guess to clarify, do you think that we can derive any benefit personally

1690
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
from solving these sorts of geometric puzzles like chess?

1691
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
What do you mean?

1692
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Research-wise, what are the outcomes

1693
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for solving something like that?

1694
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I'm just saying hypothetically, it's possible to solve the chess puzzle.

1695
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So just using chess as the example, since it's the more popular of the two,

1696
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I guess I'm just wondering if this would make the world of chess a better place.

1697
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Solving it, I don't think it makes a difference.

1698
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I mean, we have superhuman chess playing programs and nobody cares.

1699
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
They use them as sparring partners.

1700
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
But solving chess would be interesting.

1701
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
And solving checkers was interesting at one point.

1702
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Sorry, I'm just trying to get to here.

1703
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
One of the effects of this is DARPA held two workshops

1704
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
on solving games of national importance.

1705
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
And this was because of the work that we were doing on chess and checkers,

1706
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
which were very large search spaces.

1707
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And it turns out that a lot of real-world problems can be couched as games.

1708
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Politics is a game.

1709
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Military is a game.

1710
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Certain kinds of legislation laws, like environmental laws, can be couched as a game.

1711
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
The way animals interact is a game.

1712
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
The economy is a game.

1713
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Multiple players, imperfect information, things like that.

1714
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And DARPA was interested in how do we take games,

1715
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
like we'd solve the game of 10 to the 20th, which for 2007 is like a massive,

1716
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
is the biggest computational problem solved today.

1717
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And DARPA had done the work to take some real-world games

1718
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
and try and express real-world problems and express them as games,

1719
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and they were coming up with 10 to the 100th.

1720
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
So how do you get from solving games of size 10 to the 20th to 10 to the 100th?

1721
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Oh, it's only a factor of five, right?

1722
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
No, it's not a factor of five.

1723
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's much, much bigger than that.

1724
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And so solving games, bigger games like chess would be amazing

1725
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
because although the actual solving of chess,

1726
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
do we really care whether chess with perfect play is a draw or not?

1727
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
No. Do we care that checkers is a draw or not?

1728
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
No.

1729
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
It's about what are the techniques and the technologies

1730
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,000
that you would allow you to get to solve such really hard and complex problems.

1731
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And again, like I said at the beginning,

1732
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I want to emphasize this is not about games.

1733
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
It's about general-purpose techniques that you can use for other applications.

1734
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
This one, my talk became much more personal,

1735
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
so there was obviously a large game component in my talk,

1736
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,000
but the end result had to be papers that were generally applicable.

1737
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Did I have it?

1738
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Most interesting result that has used my research.

1739
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Well, let me tell you one thing that was completely unexpected

1740
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
and it goes back to this slide.

1741
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So you look at that and you say, OK, it's a big number.

1742
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
But remember, we're talking about, years ago,

1743
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
we're not talking about cheap gigabyte disks.

1744
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And how many what?

1745
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That's a billion, so we're talking about 39,000 gigabytes

1746
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
or 39 terabytes.

1747
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Well, back then it was $5,000 for a gigabyte.

1748
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I'm not going to afford a terabyte.

1749
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
It couldn't.

1750
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
So I spent a lot of time and effort,

1751
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
which has nothing to do with AI,

1752
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
in coming up with compression algorithms.

1753
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:57,000
So this whole stuff got compressed down to six gigabytes.

1754
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I had to invent new compression algorithms,

1755
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
application dependent, massive amount of compression,

1756
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
and then doing real time searching on it

1757
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
because you're playing a game,

1758
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
which means you come across a business,

1759
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
you got to go and you got to decompress part of the file,

1760
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
extract the information.

1761
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
You can't take a six gigabyte file and just unzip it

1762
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
and then look up a position and zip it.

1763
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
But you can't.

1764
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
So you got to take pieces and decompress them,

1765
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
pull things out.

1766
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And OK, fine.

1767
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So I developed this technology and thought nothing of it

1768
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
until a couple years after the Second Tinsley match

1769
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
when two biochemists walked into my office and said,

1770
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
you know, we know what you did with the checkers program

1771
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
and we think it has applications to bioinformatics.

1772
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Well, I don't know much about bioinformatics.

1773
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I hated my undergrad biology course.

1774
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And he said, well, let's not talk about checker positions

1775
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
when lost draw.

1776
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Let's talk about the letters, ACGT, DNA.

1777
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Well, your database is just a string of wins, lost draws,

1778
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
but it could be ACGT.

1779
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And if we gave you large data, could you compress it?

1780
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Similarly, I said, well, yeah, we could try that out.

1781
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
And he said, well, and if you have large data

1782
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
and you compressed it, could we use some of your technology

1783
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
to in real time go and search it and pull information out?

1784
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I said, sure.

1785
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
He said, OK, well, we're working on the human genome project.

1786
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
We're generating massive amounts of ACGT data

1787
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,000
and we want to have these programs be able to analyze this data

1788
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
in real time.

1789
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And instead of using big, massive data servers,

1790
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
we want this all compressed on something that somebody

1791
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
could do something on their laptop.

1792
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Huh, we talked about it.

1793
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Within six months, we formed a company called Biotools.

1794
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And we developed three products, Peptool, GeneTool,

1795
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
and Chromotool, which did protein and DNA analysis.

1796
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And we sold those products to thousands of research labs

1797
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
around the world.

1798
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And I was very proud of it that here was DNA protein analysis

1799
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
software with checkers inside.

1800
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
And I never would have made that connection.

1801
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
And so, yeah, we did it.

1802
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
We made a bit of money.

1803
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
We sold the company.

1804
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And in many ways, I'm proud of it because one of the major

1805
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
companies who did a lot of the DNA analysis used our software

1806
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
and they were very complimentary about how much it helped

1807
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
speed up their processes.

1808
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And so it's kind of an odd story.

1809
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
But you never know where technology is going to go.

1810
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And that's cool.

1811
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I guess the other story I like, which was really good to me,

1812
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
is I've developed a lot of pathfinding algorithms.

1813
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And you go in and you publish them.

1814
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
These pathfinding algorithms can be used in GPS systems,

1815
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
but I often use these examples in computer games.

1816
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And we develop an algorithm, a hierarchical pathfinding that

1817
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
was very fast.

1818
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And at a conference called AIID, Artificial Intelligence

1819
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Interactive Digital Entertainment, which is on my mind

1820
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
because we're hosting it next week in Edmonton.

1821
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
But at one of the conferences, one of the major computer games

1822
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
companies, the guy comes up to me and says, yeah,

1823
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
we really like your hierarchical pathfinding.

1824
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
We use it for all of our pathfinding in games.

1825
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And I thought, wow, how cool is that that this multi-gazillion

1826
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:42,000
billion dollar company and my software, my algorithm,

1827
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
is in their products that sell 10, 20, 50 million copies.

1828
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I wrote Chinook.

1829
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
How many people in the world have ever played against Chinook?

1830
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Not many.

1831
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
How many people have played these games?

1832
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Tens or hundreds of millions of people.

1833
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And I thought, that's cool.

1834
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Now, how about a royalty that didn't get anything?

1835
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
That's part of the problem of being an academic is you publish

1836
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
things and you never know how they're going to be used

1837
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and you never know if they're going to be used.

1838
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
But finally, when you get that kind of feedback,

1839
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
it's very, very rewarding.

1840
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Yes, sir?

1841
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I think it would be ironic if your compression helped

1842
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
solve pancreatic cancer.

1843
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,000
The other question is, well, these long projects seem like

1844
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
something you could only do after you got tenure.

1845
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,000
How could anybody, I mean, how could you keep your

1846
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
department happy if you're just playing checkers all the time?

1847
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
So that's a good point.

1848
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I actually started this project in 88 and I did not get

1849
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
tenure until 89, but that was close enough.

1850
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You raised a good point.

1851
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I kept my research group going and I had other projects

1852
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
on the go, but this was my passion.

1853
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
This is where I poured most of my time and effort into it.

1854
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
But the interesting thing is that the two years where I put

1855
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
the most time and effort, which was 1992 for the first match

1856
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
against Tinsley in 1994, which is the second match of the

1857
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Tinsley, there I poured my heart and soul into those efforts

1858
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
and there were almost no publications that year because

1859
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
of doing this.

1860
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And those are the only two years in my academic career where

1861
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I got substandard evaluations because I wasn't publishing.

1862
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
It sort of reinforced the publisher paradigm.

1863
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
If you didn't publish, well, sorry, but I was doing something

1864
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
that I felt was bigger and in the long run I was right.

1865
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
But you're absolutely right.

1866
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Most people can't commit to this type of thing at an early

1867
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
stage of their career.

1868
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It would be suicide.

1869
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Oh, sorry.

1870
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It would be professional suicide.

1871
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I've got to be careful what I say, especially to graduate

1872
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
students.

1873
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Yes, other questions?

1874
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Thank you again.

1875
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Thank you.

1876
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Give you a small applause from the department.

1877
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Wonderful.

1878
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Thank you.

1879
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
My pleasure.
