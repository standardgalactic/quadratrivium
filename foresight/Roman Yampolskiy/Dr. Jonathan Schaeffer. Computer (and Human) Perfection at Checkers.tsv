0	15000	It's a great pleasure for me to introduce today's seminar speaker, Dr. Jonathan Schaefer.
15000	23000	He's a world-famous expert on AI for games, games with AI, solving games, building world
23000	31000	championships, playing bots. They published a very famous paper on solving checkers.
31000	35000	That's the punchline. Hey, you're giving away the spoiler.
35000	39000	We already got to get some tools for this.
39000	50000	He took a break and became a dean for about six years, so now hopefully we'll get him back on the side of science.
51000	55000	I'll let you tell us what you actually are.
55000	59000	Great. Thank you very much. I'm delighted to be here. Thank you very much for coming on a Friday afternoon.
59000	66000	I know that you're here for the talk. The pizza wasn't irrelevant in your decision to come here.
66000	72000	This is a very strange talk. It's not the kind of talk that you're used to having.
72000	76000	I'm not going to go into much technical stuff. There are a few technical slides.
76000	80000	I'll be delighted to talk technical after the talk.
80000	87000	This is a very deeply personal story. It's something that happened to me that I didn't expect to happen.
87000	93000	It affected me profoundly. This is a talk of stories.
93000	99000	I'll apologize in advance because what usually happens is story after story.
99000	107000	Oh my God, the one hour is up. The last part usually gets done very quickly and so my apologies.
107000	112000	There's an important lesson in this talk that I want to pass on to graduate students.
112000	118000	That's about research because there's two kinds of research.
118000	123000	The first is the one that we're most familiar with. It's what I call inspiration.
123000	130000	It's where you work and you think about problems and all of a sudden you get that aha moment.
130000	136000	The light bulb goes off and you've got the idea that's going to allow you to prove this theorem
136000	139000	or you've got this great idea how to make this algorithm better
139000	143000	and you get that moment of inspiration and you're really pumped up and excited
143000	149000	and you code it or you write it up and voila, you've got a paper or maybe you've got a thesis or whatever.
150000	153000	That's the kind of research that we most think about.
153000	158000	But there's another kind of research which I call the perspiration research.
158000	162000	It's the stuff that's really hard work.
162000	169000	It may not be as glamorous as inspiration. It may not be as exciting as inspiration
169000	172000	but it's the kind of work that you have to do.
172000	176000	If you're working say in operating systems and you've got to build an operating system
176000	180000	you might spend a year or two or three designing and building an operating system.
180000	185000	There's a lot of perspiration before you get to the point where you can do the inspiration.
185000	188000	This talk is about perspiration.
188000	192000	This talk took 20 years to make.
192000	202000	There aren't a lot of projects which take 20 years worth of human and computing power in order to achieve.
203000	206000	Let me talk about games and AI research.
206000	210000	First of all I want to be clear. I'm an artificial intelligence researcher.
210000	216000	When I was young I had a passion for games and I thought well I'm going to use games for my AI research.
216000	221000	That's what sort of marked me throughout my career.
221000	230000	My research has been applied to many other problems including scheduling, GPS, bioinformatics, all sorts of other things.
230000	235000	When it comes to demonstrating the core ideas I like to use games and puzzles
235000	240000	because I can relate to an audience.
240000	243000	I can explain it in terms that people can understand.
243000	250000	I like to use games as my experimental test bed but everything I do is much more general.
250000	254000	Games are just the way of illustrating the ideas.
254000	259000	If you go back to the dawn of computing science, in fact if you go back even further
259000	266000	before computing science all the way back to Charles Babbage and his difference engine in the 1800s
266000	270000	people were thinking about building game playing programs.
270000	272000	That's what Babbage wanted to do.
272000	278000	That's what people like Alan Turing, one of the fathers of computing science, wanted to do.
278000	286000	When AI became a discipline in the late 1950s at the famous Dartmouth conference
286000	291000	building a high performance game playing program is one of the big grand challenges.
291000	293000	Could we do it?
293000	296000	Today in 2018 we can look back.
296000	301000	We can talk about Success in Chess, 1997 with Deep Blue.
301000	305000	By the way, the co-author of Deep Blue, one of the three co-authors,
305000	312000	Murray Campbell, born and raised in Edmonton which is where I'm from.
312000	315000	He did his bachelor's and master's degree at the University of Alberta
315000	319000	which is where I'm from before going to Carnegie Mellon to do his PhD.
319000	323000	Part of our game's lineage includes Deep Blue.
323000	327000	Backgammon, Jerry Tassara in the late 1990s.
327000	334000	He doesn't have a University of Alberta connection but he used reinforcement learning
334000	339000	which is a very powerful technique which is developed by Rich Sutton
339000	343000	who was a professor at the University of Alberta.
343000	350000	Poker, it's a project that started in 1995 and in 2008 we went superhuman and two player,
350000	355000	Limit Texas Holdem and so that was the University of Alberta success.
355000	360000	You may have heard in 2015 we solved two player Limit Texas Holdem
360000	366000	and in 2017 and 2018 University of Alberta and Carnegie Mellon University
366000	370000	went superhuman in two player No Limit Texas Holdem.
370000	372000	That's the game you see on TV.
372000	377000	And Go in 2016, computers went superhuman and again just to brag,
377000	382000	the lead author on AlphaGo and AlphaZero, the programs that went superhuman.
382000	386000	The lead author is David Silver who did his PhD at the University of Alberta
386000	389000	and the second lead was Azure Wang who did his postdoc there.
389000	393000	So we've done a lot of work in AI using games at the University of Alberta
393000	399000	and our academic children and grandchildren have done a lot of work.
399000	405000	But I was working in chess in the 1990s and I had one of the best chess programs in the world.
405000	409000	It tied for first in the world computer chess championships in 1986
409000	413000	and a chance conversation with a friend said what happened with checkers?
413000	416000	Everybody's talking about chess, what happened with checkers?
416000	420000	Checkers is an interesting game, it's a simple but not so simple game
420000	423000	but it has all the same research opportunities as chess.
423000	426000	So why weren't people looking at checkers?
426000	430000	Now this isn't really a talk about checkers, this is really a talk about man and machine
430000	437000	and so I may use some checkers jargon but you don't need that to understand the talk.
437000	440000	So what happened with computer checkers?
440000	447000	The first real game playing program was a checkers program developed in the early 1950s
447000	452000	but in the late 1950s a fellow named Arthur Samuel who went on to work at IBM
452000	457000	for most of his career developed a checker playing program to play against humans
457000	460000	and that's Samuel standing up.
460000	465000	And in 1963 IBM sponsored a match, man versus machine,
465000	472000	Samuel's checker playing program versus a fellow named Robert Neely.
472000	476000	Now you have to think back to 1963 and use your imagination
476000	482000	because computers, this is not a computer in 1963, what is a computer?
482000	488000	A computer fills a half this room with vacuum tubes and spinning tape wheels
488000	490000	just like that of the Hollywood movies.
490000	502000	And in 1963 IBM's machines running Samuel's software defeated Robert Neely in a single game.
502000	506000	Computer defeated man at checkers.
506000	512000	Now I have this wonderful collection of articles from newspapers and magazines.
512000	516000	Computers defeat master Robert Neely at checkers.
516000	520000	Computers defeat US checkers champion.
520000	524000	Computers are as good as the world champion.
524000	528000	Computers solved the game of checkers.
528000	531000	Now let me be clear about the word solved.
531000	536000	Checkers has 5 times 10 to the 20th possible positions, 10 to the 20th.
536000	541000	You guys are computer scientists, that's a lot of zeros.
541000	548000	I have this wonderful, I wrote Samuel's family and got his unpublished autobiography
548000	556000	and in 1959 he writes excitedly, I got this fantastic, I got access to this fantastic new IBM computer
556000	563000	and that computer could do 15,000 additions per minute.
563000	568000	Now 15,000 addition operations per minute.
568000	575000	You're not going to get to 10 to the 20th in my lifetime or your lifetime or whatever.
575000	581000	So he had very slow computers and what happened was this got exaggerated out of control
581000	586000	because this was a milestone in a time when people didn't know
586000	589000	and didn't understand what computing technology was.
589000	593000	This was the first demonstration, public demonstration of what computers could do.
593000	600000	It wasn't the typical application which was like missile trajectories
600000	603000	which is what many of the early computers were done.
603000	608000	And in 1968 Samuel's program played an exhibition match against the world champion
608000	614000	and against the world championship challenger and the program got crushed.
614000	617000	Eight games. So the program wasn't very good.
617000	621000	And for the record nearly, he was not world champion caliber.
621000	625000	He was not US champion.
625000	629000	He was not a master.
629000	634000	He was, I can't remember which state now, was it Tennessee?
634000	638000	He was the Tennessee State Blind Champion.
638000	643000	And so he was a good casual player.
643000	645000	They played six games.
645000	648000	The computer won one of the six.
648000	651000	Nearly one, sorry, nearly won two.
651000	653000	Three games were draws.
653000	657000	Nobody remembers except the one game that nearly won.
657000	661000	And so even despite what I'm saying here this was an incredible result
661000	665000	because Samuel actually invented reinforcement learning
665000	669000	and although he didn't understand fully what he was doing
669000	672000	it was an incredible machine learning accomplishment.
672000	675000	And so I got very interested in checkers because people ignored checkers
675000	677000	because Samuel had done all this work.
677000	681000	So in 1989 I wrote my first research grant to say I want to try
681000	685000	and build a world champion caliber checker playing program.
685000	690000	And I was very angry when the research granting agency
690000	696000	denied my request for a research grant and had the following quote in it.
696000	703000	Okay, I was lost already.
703000	708000	So what this talk is about is realizing Samuel's dream.
708000	712000	It's man versus machine for the world checkers championship.
712000	714000	We have two computers playing.
714000	716000	One of them I developed.
716000	717000	His name is Shanook.
717000	719000	It's a computer program.
719000	723000	And the other is a human program, the Marion Tinsley model.
723000	724000	It was a computer.
724000	727000	It was built in 1928.
727000	729000	One-of-a-kind model.
729000	731000	There were no replacement parts built.
731000	733000	So it was just literally one-of-a-kind.
733000	737000	No replacement parts for that computer definitely was a problem later on,
737000	739000	as you'll see.
739000	743000	Okay, so let's talk about the challenger for the world championship,
743000	744000	Shanook.
744000	746000	Started as a project in 1988.
746000	751000	I started playing around with it and well, it looked interesting.
751000	754000	In 1989, the world computer chess championships were held.
754000	755000	They're held every three years.
755000	757000	And I co-organized them.
757000	758000	They were in Edmonton.
758000	761000	And I had expectations that my program would do well,
761000	762000	but it didn't.
762000	763000	It crashed and burned.
763000	767000	Some friends of mine at another group, Carnegie Mellon,
767000	771000	had a team called Deep Thought, which won the world championship.
771000	774000	They later moved to IBM to become Deep Blue.
774000	778000	And so I was so pissed off because I wanted to be world champion.
778000	781000	And it turned out that in a couple of months,
781000	784000	there was going to be the first computer Olympics,
784000	788000	where games were going to be contested in it.
788000	790000	And over the span of two months,
790000	792000	I wrote a checker playing program,
792000	794000	and I went to the computer Olympics.
794000	797000	And in 1989, my program, which I named Shanook,
797000	799000	won the computer Olympiad.
799000	802000	Now, interesting thing about this program,
802000	803000	a little bit of technology.
803000	806000	One of the things we built, which was amazing,
806000	809000	its performance was the four-piece database.
809000	813000	Now, checker starts with 24 pieces on the board.
813000	815000	Pieces get removed.
815000	818000	And eventually, you could get down to like one piece.
818000	820000	And again, you don't need to know the rules,
820000	822000	but if I have a piece and you don't have a piece,
822000	823000	I win, you lose.
823000	826000	But what we did is wrote a program that said,
826000	830000	let's enumerate every single position with one piece on the board.
830000	833000	And compute whether it's a win, loss, or draw.
833000	835000	Well, if you only have one piece, you win.
835000	836000	Done.
836000	838000	But having done that, you can now do
838000	840000	what we call retrograde analysis, go backwards.
840000	843000	Let's solve all positions with two pieces on the board.
843000	846000	Because when you analyze with two pieces on the board,
846000	849000	if one of them comes off, you're down to one piece,
849000	851000	and you can look it up in your database.
851000	853000	So you look up at all the two pieces.
853000	856000	Then you go to three pieces, which reduced to two.
856000	858000	And then you go to four.
858000	861000	Now, I had seven million positions,
861000	862000	and I built that database.
862000	865000	And as the program would search, whenever it got in
865000	869000	and its analysis came down to four pieces, it could stop.
869000	872000	Look up in its database and know whether the position
872000	875000	was a win, a loss, or a draw.
875000	878000	And we won the Olympiad against other computer programs,
878000	881000	and it was clear that the program played very well
881000	884000	and that the databases made a big difference.
884000	887000	So I was on sabbatical in 1989,
887000	890000	and I started working on my program.
890000	895000	And a checker playing friend who had seen the program said,
895000	898000	you know, I'd really like to see how you would do
898000	900000	in the US championship.
900000	903000	And I said, well, why do I want to do that?
903000	907000	And he said, well, every two years there's the US championship
907000	909000	and there's the British championship,
909000	912000	and the winner of those events gets to play
912000	914000	for the world championship.
914000	917000	So if you can get into the US championship,
917000	919000	you're going to be playing against the best players
919000	921000	in the world because they're all trying to earn the right
921000	923000	to play for the world championship.
923000	926000	The problem is in the US championships there's three categories.
926000	930000	The master category, which is for the best players in the world,
930000	932000	masters, grandmasters.
932000	937000	The majors, which is for the reasonably good players.
937000	941000	And the minors, which is for the beginners.
941000	943000	And I said, wow, that's kind of cool.
943000	946000	If I could get into the masters category,
946000	949000	then I'd have a chance to play against world class players
949000	951000	and see how we could do, right?
951000	953000	I mean, I want to build a strong program.
953000	955000	The problem was, how do I get in?
955000	957000	It's not like I can just walk in and say,
957000	959000	I got a great program.
959000	961000	Let me into the US championship in the masters, right?
961000	964000	That'd be like me saying, hey, I think I'm a really great golfer.
964000	967000	I want to go and play in the US open against Tiger Woods.
967000	969000	Ain't going to happen, right?
969000	971000	So how do I get in?
971000	974000	I'm fighting a battle because two years previously,
974000	978000	a commercial manufacturer, who I will not name,
978000	981000	said, oh, we have a checker playing program.
981000	983000	We'd like to get into the US championship.
983000	985000	And people laughed at him.
985000	987000	The program went into not the masters,
987000	989000	not the major, to the minor section,
989000	991000	which is where all the beginners are.
991000	994000	And you play 32 games in these tournaments,
994000	1002000	and it lost its first 31 in games.
1002000	1007000	And in game 32, something very strange happened,
1007000	1009000	and it won.
1009000	1011000	And nobody will admit what happened,
1011000	1014000	except that the human opponent who lost
1014000	1020000	was very happy with his results.
1020000	1026000	So people knew that this program was really pathetic.
1026000	1028000	And so I had this battle.
1028000	1030000	How do I get into the master section?
1030000	1032000	So I arranged something.
1032000	1034000	I said, OK, I'm going to be diabolical.
1034000	1037000	I arranged a, quote, conference,
1037000	1040000	unquote, at the University of Alberta.
1040000	1043000	I invited a grandmaster who people said
1043000	1045000	he was receptive to playing computers,
1045000	1047000	two grandmasters, and a master.
1047000	1049000	And I brought them to Edmonton.
1049000	1052000	I used my research money, which I didn't have for checkers
1052000	1054000	because that had been turned down.
1054000	1056000	I used my research money for parallel computing
1056000	1059000	because I was wink, wink, using multiple computers
1059000	1061000	to play checkers.
1061000	1063000	And I brought them there,
1063000	1066000	and I had them play games against my program.
1066000	1068000	And over the span of a week,
1068000	1072000	they played 20 competitive games against my program.
1072000	1075000	And the grandmasters won four games,
1075000	1078000	lost one, and there were 15 draws.
1078000	1080000	And I was pissed off.
1080000	1081000	I was so angry.
1081000	1084000	We lost.
1084000	1088000	And my colleague said, man, you are so competitive.
1088000	1091000	No, not really, but you are so competitive.
1091000	1093000	You have no sense of perspective.
1093000	1095000	And I said, what do you mean, he said,
1095000	1097000	you've been working on this program less than a year.
1097000	1099000	You beat a grandmaster.
1099000	1102000	You only lost four to one.
1102000	1106000	How strong is the program going to be in a year?
1106000	1108000	And he was right.
1108000	1111000	Lots of bugs in the program.
1111000	1114000	It was very impressive.
1114000	1116000	So the checkers conference,
1116000	1118000	we had master level performance.
1118000	1121000	And we had the five piece databases,
1121000	1125000	149 million positions.
1125000	1130000	Now, what I did is I got the grandmasters
1130000	1132000	to write letters to the American Checker Federation
1132000	1134000	saying, hey, you know, this program is really good.
1134000	1136000	It shouldn't be in the minors.
1136000	1138000	It shouldn't be in the majors.
1138000	1140000	It'll compete in the masters.
1140000	1142000	One of the grandmasters said, it'll compete in the master.
1142000	1144000	It'll finish near the bottom,
1144000	1146000	but it won't be embarrassing.
1146000	1148000	It'll be respectable.
1148000	1150000	And so I got these letters and I wrote away
1150000	1152000	to the American Checker Federation.
1152000	1154000	I said, let me into the masters.
1154000	1156000	And I waited and waited and waited.
1156000	1158000	And I finally got a letter back.
1158000	1162000	And they said, yeah, OK, you can get into the masters.
1162000	1163000	It'll be a novel.
1163000	1164000	It'll be interesting.
1164000	1166000	It looks like you've got something
1166000	1168000	that at least will be entertaining for us.
1168000	1170000	And I said, fantastic.
1170000	1172000	That was great.
1172000	1174000	And I thought, boy, I'm really surprised
1174000	1176000	they didn't write more.
1176000	1178000	But OK, I'll take it.
1178000	1179000	That's great.
1179000	1182000	And then like a week later, I got another letter.
1182000	1185000	And I thought, OK, they figured out what my strategy was.
1185000	1190000	And I read the letter and it said, oh, by the way,
1190000	1194000	if you're not allowed to win any money.
1194000	1199000	OK, you know, we're not going to win any money.
1200000	1206000	And even if we did win money, you know, we wouldn't take it.
1206000	1208000	In fact, I wrote them back and I said, look,
1208000	1210000	we don't want any money.
1210000	1213000	But in order to make this easy, we'll even offer a prize
1213000	1216000	for whoever plays the best game against the computer
1216000	1218000	to get prize money.
1218000	1220000	It turns out they were actually worried
1220000	1222000	we were going to win any money because there was
1222000	1224000	a $1,000 prize for the best junior player
1224000	1226000	under 18 years of age.
1226000	1230000	And they were afraid that I would claim my program was
1230000	1232000	one year old.
1232000	1234000	So they said, OK, fine.
1234000	1237000	And then a week later, I got another letter.
1237000	1239000	Oh, you can't win any money and you're not
1239000	1242000	allowed to win any trophies.
1242000	1243000	That's fine.
1243000	1244000	I don't need trophies.
1244000	1246000	That's OK.
1246000	1248000	And I waited and waited.
1248000	1252000	I expected one more letter, which I never got.
1252000	1254000	Who cares about the money?
1254000	1257000	Who cares about the trophy?
1257000	1260000	The real prize was if you won the tournament,
1260000	1264000	you got the challenge for the world championship.
1264000	1266000	They never thought about it.
1266000	1268000	They never wrote a letter.
1268000	1274000	And so we went to the US championships in the summer of 1990
1274000	1277000	not being allowed to win any money or trophies
1277000	1280000	and nothing else.
1280000	1284000	So we had a surprise.
1284000	1286000	The week before the US championship,
1286000	1289000	it was held in Tupelo, Mississippi.
1289000	1292000	Do not go to Tupelo, Mississippi in August.
1292000	1295000	Besides being hot, it's Elvis Presley's birthplace.
1295000	1299000	And August is the anniversary of his birth.
1299000	1303000	And the whole city is Elvis crazy.
1303000	1307000	So, well, we had a big surprise.
1307000	1309000	We went to the Mississippi state championship.
1309000	1312000	16 games, first place, undefeated.
1312000	1315000	And why that's amazing is because several of the grandmasters
1315000	1317000	had come early for the US championship
1317000	1319000	and they were playing.
1319000	1320000	We beat them.
1320000	1322000	We didn't lose a single game.
1322000	1325000	What people didn't understand is that the program was
1325000	1330000	incredibly strong since the checkers conference
1330000	1333000	because we now had the six piece databases,
1333000	1338000	2.7 billion positions, and a whole bunch of bugs fixed.
1338000	1341000	And this made a huge, huge difference.
1341000	1343000	By the way, 2.7 billion positions,
1343000	1345000	it was really stretching my research
1345000	1347000	grant capabilities at the time.
1347000	1348000	Remember, this is 1990.
1348000	1350000	We're talking about billion.
1350000	1352000	Billion is a small number today.
1352000	1354000	But in 1990, it was big.
1354000	1358000	I had to scrounge money to get my first
1358000	1364000	one gigabyte disk, $5,000 plus tax and shipping.
1364000	1366000	One gigabyte, 1990.
1366000	1372000	So, computing 2.7 billion positions was a huge task in 1990.
1372000	1378000	People were shocked that we won this.
1378000	1382000	And the next week, we went into the US championship.
1382000	1384000	And all the best players in the world were there,
1384000	1385000	except for one.
1385000	1388000	But most importantly, the world champion,
1388000	1391000	Marion Tinsley, was also there.
1391000	1393000	And the program started slowly.
1393000	1395000	It was drawing game after game.
1395000	1396000	Why?
1396000	1397000	We'd been winning.
1397000	1398000	Why were we drawing?
1398000	1400000	It turned out that, of course,
1400000	1401000	playing in the Mississippi State Championship,
1401000	1402000	all of a sudden people said,
1402000	1404000	this program is really good.
1404000	1407000	So they played really cautious draw checkers
1407000	1409000	because they wanted to escape with draws.
1409000	1411000	And halfway through the tournament,
1411000	1415000	I'm so frustrated because we're drawing
1415000	1417000	and not winning enough games.
1417000	1420000	But I put something in which I called the fudge factor.
1420000	1423000	It was just, you know, we've got to do something.
1423000	1425000	So I put in a very simple line of code
1425000	1431000	that penalized the program for reducing
1431000	1433000	the number of pieces on the board.
1433000	1435000	The idea was that the more pieces on the board,
1435000	1437000	the more complex the position was,
1437000	1438000	and the more complex it was,
1438000	1441000	the higher the probability the human would make a mistake.
1441000	1444000	So if the program started exchanging pieces
1444000	1447000	to reduce the number of pieces, it got a penalty.
1447000	1449000	And so all of a sudden, like overnight,
1449000	1451000	the program became a monster
1451000	1455000	and started winning and winning and winning.
1455000	1460000	And after 24 games, we're now in second place.
1460000	1462000	First place is the World Champion.
1462000	1465000	And in the seventh round, a four-game match,
1465000	1467000	we had to play the World Champion.
1467000	1469000	This was the first time in history that a human
1469000	1476000	and a computer played a match that was not an exhibition match.
1476000	1477000	This was the real thing.
1477000	1481000	Tinsley had to play us or forfeit.
1481000	1486000	First game of the match turned out to be a classic.
1486000	1488000	First of all, there's the World Champion.
1488000	1489000	There's me.
1489000	1492000	We're playing against each other.
1492000	1494000	And there's this ring of players,
1494000	1497000	two, three, four, deep around watching,
1497000	1500000	because I remember one checker player saying,
1500000	1502000	I want to see Tinsley spank the computer.
1502000	1505000	They wanted to see Tinsley beat this upstart computer
1505000	1509000	because it hadn't lost.
1509000	1511000	And I'm not a checker player,
1511000	1514000	so I live and die based on the evaluation
1514000	1516000	that the computer gives me.
1516000	1517000	It's like the stock market.
1517000	1519000	The number goes up, you're happy,
1519000	1520000	and the number goes down,
1520000	1522000	and you're wondering, what do you do?
1522000	1524000	We're 10 moves into the game,
1524000	1526000	and the computer says it's equal,
1526000	1528000	maybe a small advantage to the computer,
1528000	1530000	and I'm sitting there thinking pretty smugly,
1530000	1532000	this is great, World Champion,
1532000	1534000	10 moves in, we're invincible.
1534000	1539000	And then he played a move that sacrificed the checker.
1539000	1541000	And the moment he made the move,
1541000	1544000	you could hear the chuckles in the room.
1544000	1547000	Because for a human, this was an obvious move,
1547000	1551000	and it gave Tinsley an incredibly strong position.
1551000	1554000	And within a minute or two of him playing this move,
1554000	1556000	all the spectators disappeared
1556000	1559000	because in their mind, the game was over.
1559000	1561000	And I'm sitting there thinking,
1561000	1562000	we just were out to check her up,
1562000	1564000	Chinook is happy, we're going to win,
1564000	1565000	this is great.
1565000	1568000	Then a couple moves later, we're up a checker,
1568000	1570000	the position's even, this is still great.
1570000	1573000	And a few moves later, we're up a checker,
1573000	1576000	Tinsley's got an advantage, that's all great.
1576000	1579000	And a few moves later, things look really bleak.
1580000	1583000	And we're playing on, and an hour goes by,
1583000	1585000	and a few players start coming back,
1585000	1587000	looking what's going on.
1587000	1591000	And more time goes by, and more people come by and watch.
1591000	1593000	And then finally, Tinsley reaches out,
1593000	1596000	stops the clock, extends his hand,
1596000	1598000	and offers a draw.
1598000	1603000	It turns out, Tinsley's sacrifice was sound.
1603000	1608000	There was a very long and narrow path to a win.
1608000	1610000	He could have won the game.
1610000	1613000	And he made most of the moves correctly,
1613000	1615000	and then at the end, he slipped up,
1615000	1617000	and it became a draw.
1619000	1622000	The next three games against Tinsley were uneventful,
1622000	1624000	and they all ended in draws.
1624000	1626000	We had just drawn a four-game match
1626000	1628000	against the world champion.
1628000	1630000	In the last round, we were paired against the world's
1630000	1632000	number two player, Don Lafferty.
1632000	1634000	We won a game, we drew three,
1634000	1636000	Tinsley won his match,
1636000	1640000	and the end result was that Tinsley finished first,
1640000	1642000	Chinook finished second,
1642000	1646000	and the rules of the competition were that
1646000	1648000	the first-place finisher was challenged
1648000	1649000	for the world championship,
1649000	1651000	and if the first-place finisher was the world champion,
1651000	1654000	that right went down to the second-place finisher.
1654000	1656000	So in the summer of 1990,
1656000	1662000	Chinook became the official world championship challenger.
1662000	1665000	The first thing I did after this is I tried to find
1665000	1668000	Arthur Samuel and tell him what had happened,
1668000	1670000	and he had left IBM long ago.
1670000	1673000	It turns out he had moved to California,
1673000	1675000	who's at Stanford University,
1675000	1678000	working for Donald Knuth on tech.
1678000	1681000	I'm sure you're all familiar with tech, or lay tech.
1681000	1684000	It's a variant system,
1684000	1688000	and it turns out, much to my shock,
1688000	1691000	like three days before we won the right to play
1691000	1694000	for the world championship, Samuel had passed away.
1694000	1696000	It turns out he, in the last years of his life,
1696000	1699000	had been suffering for Alzheimer's disease.
1699000	1702000	He liked to claim he was the world's oldest programmer.
1702000	1705000	Up to age 90, he was going in every day to
1705000	1707000	Stanford University writing code
1707000	1709000	for the development of the tech system,
1709000	1712000	and it just seemed ironic that we finally realized
1712000	1714000	his dream, in some sense,
1714000	1718000	and he passed away just as that was happening.
1718000	1721000	All right.
1721000	1723000	Let's talk about the champion.
1723000	1725000	Marion Tinsley.
1725000	1728000	1950, he was the up-and-coming favorite
1728000	1730000	to win the U.S. championship,
1730000	1732000	play for the world championship, and win it.
1732000	1735000	In 1950, he's playing in the last round
1735000	1737000	for the U.S. championship.
1737000	1739000	In a winning position,
1739000	1743000	he had a one-move oversight,
1743000	1746000	and blundered, and lost the game,
1746000	1748000	and he didn't finish first,
1748000	1750000	which means he didn't play for the world championship,
1750000	1752000	and he was stunned.
1752000	1754000	Everybody was shocked.
1754000	1756000	He disappeared for two years.
1756000	1759000	He came back in 1952 and he won everything,
1759000	1761000	including the right to play for the world championship,
1761000	1764000	went to the world championship, and won it.
1764000	1767000	In 1958, he won the world championship,
1767000	1769000	or defended his world championship,
1769000	1771000	and then he retired.
1771000	1773000	He said, you know what?
1773000	1775000	I don't need this anymore.
1775000	1778000	He went and finished his Ph.D. in math
1778000	1781000	at Ohio State University.
1781000	1784000	Friends convinced him to come back in 1970.
1784000	1786000	He won the U.S. championship,
1786000	1788000	was going to play for the world championship,
1788000	1790000	but the world champion was ill.
1790000	1792000	He had a heart attack.
1792000	1794000	Tinsley said, I don't want to play him,
1794000	1796000	and so he went back into retirement.
1796000	1800000	In 1975, the world champion at the time died.
1800000	1802000	Tinsley was convinced to come back.
1802000	1804000	He won the U.S. championship,
1804000	1806000	he won the world championship,
1806000	1810000	played it, held it until 1991 when he retired.
1810000	1813000	If you go back to that fateful game in 1950,
1813000	1818000	and look what he did between 1950 and 1991,
1818000	1822000	he finished first in every tournament he played in.
1822000	1826000	Not shared first, first.
1826000	1828000	He played multiple matches,
1828000	1830000	including for the world championship,
1830000	1835000	and he won them, usually by a wide margin.
1835000	1839000	And he literally crushed the opposition.
1839000	1845000	So early on, I called Mary and Tinsley a human computer.
1845000	1847000	Well, there's some truth in that.
1847000	1850000	Is this man or machine?
1850000	1854000	Because from the period 1950 to 1992,
1854000	1859000	Tinsley only lost three games of checkers.
1859000	1864000	Three games of checkers out of thousands that he played.
1864000	1867000	You don't think of humans being that good.
1867000	1870000	You think of machines having that level of perfection.
1870000	1876000	If you ever asked Tinsley how many games he lost,
1876000	1879000	he would shake his head sadly and say it was five.
1879000	1882000	Five. Why was it five?
1882000	1885000	Well, Tinsley often gave exhibitions,
1885000	1887000	so somebody would organize,
1887000	1890000	like you're going to play 40 people at a shopping mall,
1890000	1892000	you're going to play them all simultaneously,
1892000	1894000	well, once at a shopping mall,
1894000	1898000	while playing 40 people simultaneously in a winning position,
1898000	1905000	he inexplicably made a one-move blunder and lost.
1905000	1907000	I asked Grandmaster Don Lafferty
1907000	1909000	for many years the world's second best player
1909000	1911000	if he'd ever beaten Tinsley,
1911000	1914000	and the answer was yes, once.
1914000	1917000	On a Saturday night, late at night,
1917000	1921000	after we'd both had far too much to drink.
1921000	1924000	That was the only time Lafferty ever beat him.
1924000	1928000	Five losses over 40 years.
1928000	1932000	Basically, Tinsley's computer brain,
1932000	1937000	there was a neuron up there that misfired about every 14 years,
1937000	1940000	causing him to make a one-move blunder and lose a game.
1940000	1943000	There's only one recorded game where he got outplayed.
1943000	1948000	This man was more a machine than man.
1949000	1953000	So, prelude to the match.
1953000	1955000	We had just earned the right to play Tinsley
1955000	1957000	for the world championship.
1957000	1960000	What do you think the first thing Tinsley does?
1960000	1962000	He phones me up and he says,
1962000	1966000	hey, let's play a fun match.
1966000	1969000	What? The world champion wants to play a fun match?
1969000	1971000	He says, yeah, sure.
1971000	1974000	He's bored playing humans because he beats them.
1974000	1977000	And so we wanted to test himself out against the computer.
1977000	1979000	So we arranged for him, brought him to Edmonton,
1979000	1984000	and we played a match, and he beat us 7.5 to 6.5.
1984000	1987000	The first nine games were draws.
1987000	1992000	In the 10th game on the 10th move, something happened.
1992000	1995000	The program says even.
1995000	1998000	The program was flip-flopping between two moves,
1998000	2001000	and at the last minute chose a particular move.
2001000	2004000	In the moment I made that move, Tinsley said,
2004000	2006000	you're going to regret that.
2006000	2008000	And of course, I'm looking at the screen
2008000	2010000	and it says the game is even.
2010000	2014000	And a few moves later, Tinsley got an advantage,
2014000	2016000	and a few moves later, he's better,
2016000	2018000	and you know the whole story.
2018000	2020000	We lost that.
2020000	2022000	I was obsessed with that position.
2022000	2027000	I've done the analysis to the point from when he said
2027000	2033000	you're going to regret that to the loss is 64 moves.
2034000	2037000	And of course, I realized there's no way
2037000	2040000	I'm going to write a program that's going to analyze that deep.
2040000	2044000	I mean, the exponential growth is just enormous.
2044000	2048000	It just brought home how deep he was thinking
2048000	2050000	and he understood the game.
2050000	2054000	So we ended up losing the match 1 win to 0, 13 draws.
2054000	2058000	And again, being competitive, I was very upset that we lost.
2058000	2060000	But the checker world was a gog,
2060000	2064000	like you only lost by one game against Tinsley.
2064000	2066000	That's incredible.
2066000	2068000	Most telling was at the end of the match,
2068000	2070000	Tinsley said, I feel like a teenager again.
2070000	2073000	And I asked what he meant and he said,
2073000	2075000	playing against humans is boring.
2075000	2078000	Everybody knows how good I am.
2078000	2081000	And so they play drosh, boring games
2081000	2083000	because all they want to do is escape with the draw.
2083000	2086000	Nobody tries to beat me because they're not going to beat me.
2086000	2090000	Chinook had no respect for me.
2090000	2093000	It would walk on the edge of a precipice.
2093000	2099000	It would play loud, audacious, ridiculous moves, taunting Tinsley.
2099000	2103000	And he loved it and it reminded him of the rambunctious games
2103000	2104000	that he played when he was a teenager,
2104000	2106000	when he was learning the game.
2106000	2109000	And he said, I feel like a teenager again.
2109000	2111000	I want to play the computer.
2111000	2115000	Checkers is fun again.
2115000	2119000	And so, well, we ran into problems.
2119000	2121000	The American Checker Federation
2121000	2124000	and the English Drafts Association refused to sanction the match.
2124000	2126000	They said, oh, computers can't play.
2126000	2128000	This is the human world championship, they can't play.
2128000	2131000	And I said, look it, we abided by all the rules.
2131000	2133000	And they said, no you can't.
2133000	2138000	And then Tinsley said, I want to play the computer.
2138000	2140000	And the Checker Federation said no.
2140000	2144000	And he wrote a public letter saying they deservedly came second.
2144000	2145000	They were very strong.
2145000	2147000	I want to play them.
2147000	2149000	The Checker Federation said no.
2149000	2151000	So he said, OK, I resign.
2151000	2154000	No need the world championship, the world title.
2154000	2158000	And then he immediately signed on to play as a match.
2158000	2160000	The Checker Federations were agogged.
2160000	2165000	How can you have Tinsley not being the world champion?
2165000	2167000	But he refused to take the title back.
2167000	2171000	And so they gave him the title world champion emeritus.
2172000	2180000	And so they created a world man machine championship for the best man,
2180000	2183000	which was Tinsley, the best machine, which was Chinook.
2183000	2190000	And in August 1992, we went to London to play for the World Checkers Championship.
2190000	2193000	And there we are, the Park Lane Hotel.
2193000	2196000	Nice 3D visualization board.
2196000	2200000	You can't see it very clearly, but every time a move was made here on the computer,
2200000	2202000	there was a group up here, big audience.
2202000	2205000	Checkers is very popular, or drafts as it's called in the UK.
2205000	2211000	And so we had packed rooms for all of the games.
2211000	2217000	So match starts and the first thing, the first day was terrible.
2217000	2220000	Tinsley pressed hard in game one.
2220000	2221000	And I thought we were going to lose.
2221000	2224000	And I'm sitting on stage and I'm sweating.
2224000	2226000	All the media is there.
2226000	2227000	I mean, this was a big event.
2227000	2228000	Think Deep Blue.
2229000	2232000	And I'm sitting there, please, don't let me lose on day one.
2232000	2234000	Please don't let me lose.
2234000	2235000	And I thought we're going to lose.
2235000	2241000	And then all of a sudden, the program found its way into a draw.
2241000	2243000	And I knew we were safe.
2243000	2247000	We now had the seven-piece databases and a few of the eight-piece,
2247000	2250000	37 billion positions in the database.
2250000	2257000	And the program had found a path from the current position into a drawn database position.
2257000	2259000	I offered Tinsley a draw.
2259000	2260000	He declined.
2260000	2262000	So we played on a few more moves.
2262000	2264000	And I offered Tinsley a draw again.
2264000	2265000	And he declined.
2265000	2266000	We played on a few more moves.
2266000	2268000	I offered him again.
2268000	2269000	And he declined.
2269000	2271000	And I said, look, Marion, we're in our databases.
2271000	2272000	It's a draw.
2272000	2275000	You can play as long as you want, but we're not going to lose.
2275000	2277000	And he was stunned.
2277000	2279000	He was sure he was winning.
2279000	2283000	So he immediately shook hands and we went on to the next game.
2283000	2285000	Tinsley won game five.
2285000	2286000	He played better.
2286000	2289000	And he was winning in game seven and couldn't.
2289000	2293000	Again, the program made his life complicated and we saved it.
2293000	2297000	And so clearly after the first few days of the matches,
2297000	2301000	the consensus looked like we were going to get crushed.
2301000	2303000	I'm full of stories and I'm going to run late.
2303000	2307000	But I have to tell you this story here because this is very important.
2307000	2311000	About halfway through the match, I got an email from back home.
2311000	2314000	And all it said was database failure.
2315000	2318000	Uh-oh.
2318000	2322000	I was computing databases.
2322000	2327000	And in the rush to get to the match,
2327000	2332000	I knew that the more databases made the program stronger.
2332000	2335000	Half the time was spent computing the database
2335000	2338000	and the other half was spent verifying it.
2338000	2341000	So about a couple months before the end,
2341000	2343000	before we went to London, I made the decision
2343000	2346000	I'm going to stop the verification because I want more databases computed.
2346000	2348000	I'll take a gamble.
2348000	2350000	And now that I'm in London playing the match,
2350000	2354000	I said okay, I'll start the verification running
2354000	2357000	because it's too late to compute any more databases.
2357000	2364000	And of course one of the databases failed and sent me an email.
2364000	2365000	But there's nothing I can do it.
2365000	2366000	I'm in the middle of the match.
2366000	2368000	Nothing I can do.
2368000	2372000	After the match was over, this took place in August and September.
2372000	2374000	I finally got back home and had some free time
2374000	2377000	and I started looking what happened with the databases.
2377000	2379000	And I tracked it down to a database.
2379000	2381000	The database was there.
2381000	2383000	It was the right size, everything.
2383000	2386000	The contents were all zero.
2386000	2389000	The file was just full of null bytes.
2389000	2393000	But in my compression scheme, a zero meant draw.
2393000	2395000	So if you ever got into that database,
2395000	2399000	it didn't matter what position, it was all draws.
2400000	2405000	Guess which database it was.
2405000	2413000	It turns out that in the game we were in a drawn position.
2413000	2416000	And if Tinsley had kept playing,
2416000	2418000	it's possible we would have moved to a position
2418000	2421000	that was actually a loss.
2421000	2426000	And of course I told him information that was actually wrong
2426000	2430000	and we did draw the game and we were never in a losing position
2430000	2434000	but had he kept playing, it's possible we could have lost that.
2434000	2437000	So very scary.
2437000	2440000	So we're down one to nothing.
2440000	2444000	Now, game eight.
2444000	2448000	Game eight starts and we had prepared the program
2448000	2452000	with some complex moves and it's a try and put Tinsley on his own.
2452000	2455000	And in game eight, an opening came up
2455000	2458000	that we were able to play a move that was quite complex
2458000	2460000	and everything went well.
2460000	2463000	Until about move 12, when Tinsley made a move
2463000	2465000	and Chinook suddenly said,
2465000	2468000	the game is no longer even, we have a small advantage.
2468000	2471000	And a few moves later, the advantage got bigger.
2471000	2473000	And a few moves later, the advantage got bigger.
2473000	2475000	And my eyes started bugging out.
2475000	2477000	I'm on the stage and I'm sitting there
2477000	2479000	trying to hold in my excitement.
2480000	2486000	And I got bigger and bigger and bigger.
2486000	2490000	And then finally, Tinsley reached out his hand
2490000	2494000	and resigned.
2494000	2498000	And I was stunned.
2498000	2502000	And the crowd rushed up and surrounded us.
2502000	2506000	All excited and everything because it had been an exciting game.
2506000	2509000	And they all started congratulating Tinsley.
2509000	2512000	And okay, I understand giving sympathy,
2512000	2515000	but hey, we won, this is like, we beat Tinsley.
2515000	2517000	This is big news.
2517000	2519000	And everyone's congratulating Tinsley
2519000	2521000	and I didn't understand what was going on
2521000	2524000	until the match arbiter, Con McCarrick,
2524000	2527000	goes over to Tinsley and shakes his hand and said,
2527000	2533000	I, Narian, that was a beautiful draw.
2533000	2536000	The depth of the games was such that people in the audience
2536000	2540000	didn't understand that Tinsley had resigned.
2540000	2542000	They thought it was a draw.
2542000	2544000	And Tinsley had to correct them.
2544000	2547000	And then they were stunned.
2547000	2549000	One of the reporters at that,
2549000	2551000	because this was the last game of the day,
2551000	2554000	one of the reporters, I don't remember which media outlet was there,
2554000	2557000	the end of the day, he just ran out and filed his story.
2557000	2559000	And of course the next day he says,
2559000	2562000	yeah, the games were all draws.
2562000	2567000	He had no idea that we had just made history.
2567000	2571000	Now, what do you do after you beat Tinsley?
2571000	2573000	It was like a dream of mine to beat Tinsley.
2573000	2576000	I mean, I had asked Laine in bed,
2576000	2580000	just fantasizing about beating Marion and Tinsley.
2580000	2584000	My wife looked at me sadly once while we were lying in bed
2584000	2589000	and she said, you're thinking about him again, aren't you?
2589000	2592000	I mean, what would you do if you finally beat Tinsley?
2592000	2596000	I thought I'd go out and party and buy a round for everybody,
2596000	2598000	I'd get drunk and whatever.
2598000	2602000	And me and my team, we went out that night and it was like a wake.
2602000	2604000	We were truly sad.
2604000	2607000	Over the few years we'd known Tinsley, we'd come to respect him
2607000	2609000	and we knew how painful this defeat was
2609000	2612000	and how upset and angry he was that losing.
2612000	2615000	And we felt a little bit of humanity ourselves
2615000	2617000	because we knew this was a milestone
2617000	2621000	that computers are now beating the very best humans at checkers
2621000	2624000	and if not checkers, eventually it would be chess.
2624000	2628000	And so it was a very sad event.
2628000	2631000	And that night, you know, I got back to my hotel room
2631000	2635000	and at three in the morning a reporter phoned me up
2635000	2641000	and I poured out my heart and soul to this reporter how upset I was.
2641000	2645000	Lesson, do not pour your heart and soul out to a reporter
2645000	2648000	because guess what appears the next day in the paper
2648000	2653000	is a lot of things that you probably didn't want to say.
2653000	2657000	It was actually pretty upsetting and I learned a lot about myself.
2657000	2661000	And so in Game 8 we won.
2661000	2665000	It was the first time a computer had defeated a world champion
2665000	2669000	in any game that was a non-exhibition game.
2669000	2672000	The next few games were draws
2672000	2677000	and in Game 14 it happened again.
2677000	2680000	He must have made an inferior move
2680000	2684000	and the advantage went up, up and up
2684000	2687000	and then the computer froze.
2687000	2689000	And I'm panicking.
2689000	2691000	It stopped. What's going on?
2691000	2694000	I had to leave my seat and go behind the curtains
2694000	2696000	where the computer was to take a look at the screen.
2696000	2699000	What's going on? Oh my, we've crashed. Something's wrong.
2699000	2703000	No. The computer had searched all the way to the end of the game,
2703000	2705000	had looked at all the scenarios,
2705000	2708000	it knew it was winning in every possible scenario.
2708000	2710000	There was nothing left to compute.
2710000	2714000	So it had stopped.
2714000	2717000	And a few moves later, Tinsley resigned and we won.
2717000	2719000	We were in up two to one.
2719000	2721000	That night I had no problems.
2721000	2723000	We went out and we partied.
2723000	2724000	We had a great time.
2724000	2726000	We were up two to one against the unbeatable Tinsley.
2726000	2727000	Fantastic.
2727000	2729000	On the way back home that night
2729000	2731000	I turned to my colleague and I said,
2731000	2733000	do you think it's possible?
2733000	2736000	Do you think we're going to beat Tinsley?
2736000	2741000	Wish I'd never said that.
2741000	2743000	Okay.
2743000	2746000	This is
2746000	2748000	the most painful day of my life.
2748000	2753000	August 23, 1992.
2753000	2758000	It's game 18.
2758000	2760000	We're on move 17.
2760000	2762000	Chinook has a big advantage
2762000	2765000	and I'm sitting there on stage thinking,
2765000	2767000	actually sorry, let me go back.
2767000	2769000	I'm jumping ahead.
2769000	2773000	I did first thing in the morning what I always would do.
2773000	2776000	Get up early, go down to the room,
2776000	2779000	make sure, you know, run the diagnostics on the computer,
2779000	2781000	make sure everything's okay.
2781000	2783000	Get down to the room,
2783000	2785000	unlock it, open the doors,
2785000	2788000	and I'm blasted by heat.
2788000	2791000	It was a small room and it was hot,
2791000	2793000	really hot.
2793000	2795000	What was wrong?
2795000	2799000	Well, you see, it's hard to get good help these days.
2799000	2802000	The hotel staff in the evening were supposed to
2802000	2805000	turn off the lights in the room
2805000	2808000	and turn on the air conditioning.
2808000	2810000	Off, on.
2810000	2814000	What they instead did is turn the lights on
2814000	2819000	and the air conditioning off in a small sealed room.
2819000	2822000	So it was really hot.
2822000	2824000	And when they opened the door,
2824000	2826000	the heat flooded out into the main room
2826000	2828000	where everybody would sit.
2828000	2831000	And so the first game that day was postponed for an hour
2831000	2833000	because the embarrassed hotel staff
2833000	2836000	had to go out and rent fans to try and cool the room down.
2836000	2839000	And so game 17 was played this Saturday morning
2839000	2842000	and we played it and we were sitting up on stage,
2842000	2844000	which was even hotter.
2844000	2846000	And after five moves, Tinsley just said,
2846000	2848000	look, I'm uncomfortable, I'm sweating.
2848000	2850000	This is ridiculous.
2850000	2852000	Let's just agree to a draw and take a break.
2852000	2854000	And I said, I'm up with it.
2854000	2857000	So game 17 was like a quick draw, done, finished.
2857000	2859000	We're off the stage, spectators were disappointed.
2859000	2861000	But there was another hour break
2861000	2863000	while we cooled the place down.
2863000	2865000	Then we started game 18.
2865000	2867000	Move 17.
2867000	2869000	Chinook's got a nice advantage.
2869000	2871000	And I'm sitting there on stage thinking, ha, ha,
2871000	2873000	this Tinsley guy, he's not so good.
2873000	2875000	We've got a big advantage.
2875000	2877000	We're probably going to win.
2877000	2878000	Fantastic.
2878000	2880000	Great.
2880000	2882000	And then the computer comes up and says,
2882000	2885000	beep, Tinsley database.
2885000	2888000	I thought, oh, darn.
2888000	2891000	I had put into the program's databases
2891000	2894000	all of the games that I could find that Tinsley had ever played.
2894000	2896000	And so when the Tinsley database message came up,
2896000	2900000	it found a way to go from the current position into a game
2900000	2902000	that Tinsley had previously played.
2902000	2904000	And Tinsley had this incredible memory.
2904000	2907000	He knew every single game that he'd ever played.
2907000	2909000	And I knew his memory was amazing.
2909000	2912000	And so I knew, even though the program said,
2912000	2914000	we were really, really in a good position,
2914000	2916000	I knew that we were going to draw it
2916000	2918000	because he would know this.
2918000	2920000	And I'm sitting there on stage
2920000	2922000	and just waiting for the program to move.
2922000	2925000	Draw me my fingers.
2926000	2929000	We had about 40 minutes left on our clock
2929000	2934000	to get to move 20.
2934000	2937000	So you have to play 20 moves in an hour.
2937000	2939000	We're at move 17.
2939000	2942000	So we only have three moves to make.
2942000	2944000	And we've got 40 minutes.
2944000	2945000	And the clock takes by.
2945000	2948000	And I'm dreaming, we're going to be up three to one.
2948000	2950000	This is going to be fantastic.
2950000	2952000	Man, just think of all the good things that are going to happen
2952000	2954000	with this milestone event.
2954000	2955000	Hmm, it's been 20 minutes.
2955000	2957000	That's a long think.
2957000	2958000	Wait a minute.
2958000	2962000	The program actually has a hard stop of 20 minutes for a move.
2962000	2964000	We're really over 20 minutes?
2964000	2965000	Yeah, we are.
2965000	2966000	How could that be?
2966000	2970000	And 20 minutes became 25 minutes.
2970000	2973000	And then 30 minutes.
2973000	2975000	I'm sitting there on stage.
2975000	2977000	You've got all of the media there.
2977000	2982000	You've got a couple hundred spectators.
2982000	2985000	During a game, I can't interfere in any way.
2985000	2987000	The program has to make the moves.
2987000	2990000	I'm just the operator.
2990000	2993000	And I sat there panicking because the program is just
2993000	2996000	computing, computing, something's going on.
2996000	3000000	And I watched there helplessly as the minutes ticked off.
3000000	3007000	And I watched the hour hand go around to the top
3007000	3010000	and then click our one hour was up.
3010000	3012000	We did not make the 20 moves.
3012000	3016000	We forfeited.
3016000	3020000	And so now, of course, what happens?
3020000	3024000	Well, I tried to talk to the computer, but I couldn't.
3024000	3025000	It was frozen.
3025000	3026000	It had crashed.
3026000	3027000	Something was wrong.
3027000	3028000	Actually, it hadn't crashed.
3028000	3030000	It was frozen.
3030000	3034000	I had no idea how that happened.
3034000	3036000	Tinsley was apologetic at winning this way,
3036000	3037000	but now the match was 2-2.
3037000	3039000	Nothing I could do.
3039000	3042000	And it was just absolutely terrible.
3042000	3047000	I spent that whole weekend trying to figure out what happened.
3047000	3049000	Was there a bug?
3049000	3051000	I don't know how to freeze the computer.
3051000	3054000	I don't know how my checker program could have frozen
3054000	3057000	this 8-processor Silicon Graphics computer,
3057000	3059000	but somehow it became frozen.
3059000	3061000	Was it a hardware problem?
3061000	3065000	The computer had been baked all night in this hot room.
3065000	3068000	And I talked to Silicon Graphics and they showed me a paper
3068000	3071000	out where they took their 8-processor Silicon Graphics
3071000	3074000	computer out to Death Valley in California for a weekend
3074000	3078000	and it correctly in parallel computed pi.
3078000	3081000	And so therefore, you know, it works in really hot weather
3081000	3083000	that you can compute pi.
3083000	3086000	Well, I said, you know, pi isn't like this.
3086000	3088000	We've got 8 processors, complex interactions,
3088000	3091000	a lot of message passing, a huge amount of disk activity
3091000	3093000	because you're reading the databases.
3093000	3094000	It's not the same thing.
3094000	3097000	Silicon Graphics said there was no hardware problem.
3097000	3099000	Was it a hotel problem?
3099000	3104000	I mean, it didn't happen any day before.
3104000	3106000	It never happened again.
3106000	3110000	It only happened on this day when the computer got baked.
3110000	3114000	I have no idea what happened that day.
3114000	3116000	But we forfeited.
3116000	3119000	And I spent the entire weekend at the computer
3119000	3123000	working with it, testing it, trying to recreate the problem.
3123000	3125000	And I showed up Monday morning to play Tinsley
3125000	3128000	and he was dressed as he usually is in a three-piece suit
3128000	3131000	and I had bags under my eyes and stubble on my face
3131000	3133000	because I'd literally been up the whole weekend
3133000	3135000	trying to figure out what was going on.
3135000	3140000	And to this day, I had no idea what happened except we lost.
3140000	3143000	One of the most horrible experiences of my life
3143000	3149000	was sitting on stage for the last half of that 40 minutes
3149000	3152000	knowing that something is wrong,
3152000	3155000	something helpless to do anything
3155000	3157000	and listening to the audience,
3157000	3160000	the audience talking in murmury.
3160000	3163000	As it came closer and closer to the program forfeiting,
3163000	3165000	you could just hear the people,
3165000	3167000	what's going on? What's going on?
3167000	3169000	Why isn't it moving? What's happening?
3169000	3173000	And as the program ticked down to forfeiting,
3173000	3175000	you'd just hear people go,
3175000	3177000	what? Move! Do something!
3177000	3179000	And I'm on stage and I'm helpless
3179000	3183000	and there's nothing I could do and it's just burned into my head
3183000	3185000	and we lost.
3190000	3193000	The next day, or a couple days later,
3193000	3196000	Tinsley accidentally won Game 25
3196000	3198000	and he paid us the sincerest compliment.
3198000	3201000	He said, I've had a scare.
3201000	3206000	I'm now going to play drosh, boring checkers against you
3206000	3208000	and I'm going to wait for you to make a mistake
3208000	3211000	in Game 25 and he played dull, boring drosh checkers
3211000	3214000	the west of the way and we never had a chance to win a game.
3214000	3216000	That was the ultimate compliment
3216000	3218000	because he had criticized other players
3218000	3220000	for playing that way against him
3220000	3222000	and now he was playing that way against us.
3222000	3225000	In Game 39, we're down by one game.
3225000	3227000	We need to win the game.
3227000	3230000	I set the program to have a draw being equal to a loss
3230000	3232000	because a draw did us no good
3232000	3235000	and of course the program found a draw
3235000	3237000	and would not take the draw
3237000	3239000	because I'd set it to be a loss
3239000	3241000	and we kept playing trying to win
3241000	3243000	and we eventually lost.
3243000	3246000	The final score was 20.5 for Tinsley,
3246000	3249000	Chinook, 18.5.
3249000	3252000	People were impressed.
3252000	3253000	It was a great result
3253000	3255000	but it might have been different
3255000	3258000	had it not been for Game 18.
3258000	3260000	A couple weeks after the match,
3260000	3263000	the nightmare started.
3263000	3267000	I started reliving Game 18,
3267000	3269000	those final 20 minutes.
3269000	3272000	I'd wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat
3272000	3275000	because I could hear the voices in the audience.
3275000	3278000	Why isn't it moving? What's going on?
3278000	3282000	It happened night after night after night.
3282000	3284000	People told me I had an interesting story
3284000	3286000	so I decided I had to write a book
3286000	3287000	and I wrote a book
3287000	3289000	but I could not write about Game 18
3289000	3291000	it upset me so much
3291000	3294000	and finally I had the whole book written
3294000	3296000	except for this part
3296000	3299000	and I said I got to do it, I got to do it, I got to do it
3299000	3301000	and I sat down
3301000	3305000	and I wrote about Game 18.
3305000	3307000	Done. I never went back and edited.
3307000	3311000	Done. Finished.
3311000	3314000	And I never had the nightmares again.
3314000	3316000	They stopped the next day.
3316000	3317000	Gone.
3317000	3319000	If I had known
3319000	3322000	that this would be so therapeutic to write this out
3322000	3325000	and express my feelings and emotions,
3325000	3327000	I would have done it long ago
3327000	3330000	but in the end I tortured myself by not writing it.
3330000	3334000	Anyway, the book came out in 1997.
3334000	3337000	One jump ahead challenging human supremacy in checkers
3337000	3339000	and I'm very proud of it.
3339000	3342000	It's not technical, it's this talk that I'm giving.
3342000	3345000	It's this and many other stories.
3345000	3347000	I wanted revenge
3347000	3351000	so I had to spend two years waiting for a rematch in 1994.
3351000	3353000	1994, deeper searching.
3353000	3355000	We're going 17 to 29 moves ahead.
3355000	3358000	What human can think compute that far but Tinsley could?
3358000	3361000	Improving our openings, improving our knowledge,
3361000	3363000	improving our end games.
3363000	3366000	We eventually computed all of the AP's databases.
3366000	3370000	406 billion positions in the program's memory.
3370000	3373000	The match was played at the computer museum in Boston.
3373000	3377000	That museum has now moved to Mountain View, California.
3377000	3381000	And it went off to a very strange start.
3381000	3384000	On the first day I phoned up Tinsley and I said,
3384000	3387000	let's walk over to the museum together and he said, fine.
3387000	3391000	And we're walking over and he's unusually quiet.
3391000	3393000	And then he tells me something strange.
3393000	3397000	First of all you need to know that Tinsley was also a Baptist minister.
3397000	3400000	He was a very religious person.
3400000	3404000	And he talked many times about doing God's work.
3404000	3407000	And on the walk over he turns to me and he said,
3407000	3410000	I had a dream last night.
3410000	3418000	And he said, in that dream God told me that he loved you too.
3418000	3421000	That he loved Jonathan as well.
3421000	3427000	And I looked at Tinsley in shock because at times he sort of portrayed me as the devil, right?
3427000	3429000	And he's doing God's work to slay the devil.
3429000	3432000	And I looked at him in shock and he looked at me back
3432000	3435000	and he shook his head sadly and I said, I know.
3435000	3439000	It was a very upsetting dream.
3439000	3442000	But this was so on Tinsley-like.
3442000	3445000	And then we played game one and it was a draw.
3445000	3454000	And then we played game two and Tinsley was in a lot of trouble.
3454000	3459000	And we thought he might lose it and in the end he squeaked out a draw
3459000	3463000	and it came to a critical position and after the game he told me
3463000	3465000	and he said there were six moves in that position.
3465000	3468000	I knew that five of them lost and the sixth one I didn't know
3468000	3471000	and I just put my faith in God and played the sixth move.
3471000	3475000	And it drew and I thought, boy this isn't like Tinsley.
3475000	3476000	He's such a confident person.
3476000	3479000	How could he just put his faith in God and make a move and not know?
3479000	3481000	Very strange.
3482000	3487000	A couple of games later he asked me about Derek Oldbury.
3487000	3491000	Derek was the world champion because remember Tinsley had resigned.
3491000	3494000	Derek was now the world champion but he got no respect
3494000	3497000	because he was nowhere near Tinsley's class.
3497000	3499000	And he knew that I'd played,
3499000	3503000	Chinook had played an exhibition match against Oldbury
3503000	3506000	as preparation to play Tinsley and it was all secret
3506000	3510000	and unfortunately Oldbury died about a month before we played Tinsley
3510000	3514000	and Tinsley asked, well now that Derek's dead it doesn't matter.
3514000	3517000	Maybe you could tell me what happened in the match
3517000	3522000	and I said well we beat Oldbury, three wins, no losses, 13 draws.
3522000	3529000	And Tinsley said, hmm, Chinook plays Oldbury.
3529000	3532000	Oldbury dies.
3532000	3539000	Therefore Oldbury must have died of Chinookitis.
3540000	3542000	That is so funny.
3542000	3544000	He dies of Chinookitis.
3544000	3547000	And I'm sitting there thinking, what's so funny about that?
3547000	3549000	First of all his logic is terrible.
3549000	3553000	But second of all to tie Oldbury's death,
3553000	3555000	well if you play Chinook you're going to die.
3555000	3558000	And so it was a very morbid discussion.
3558000	3561000	Anyway the first six games were all drawn.
3561000	3563000	Chinook's play was flawless.
3563000	3567000	Chinook looked bloody impressive.
3569000	3573000	The next day I phoned Tinsley up and I said, let's go.
3573000	3580000	Walked together and he immediately said, sorry,
3580000	3583000	let me suggest the unthinkable.
3583000	3586000	He said, I'd like to resign the match and the title to Chinook.
3586000	3587000	And I said why?
3587000	3589000	And he said, well I had an upset stomach last night
3589000	3590000	I wasn't feeling well.
3590000	3593000	And I said, okay, you're not feeling well.
3593000	3594000	I'm sorry about that.
3594000	3596000	We're going to postpone the games for today.
3596000	3598000	Really, I don't want to play.
3598000	3600000	Look, let's take you to the hospital.
3600000	3602000	We'll figure it out.
3602000	3604000	Let's get you better and then we'll worry about the match.
3604000	3605000	And he said, fine.
3605000	3606000	So I took him to the hospital.
3606000	3607000	He spent a whole day there.
3607000	3609000	They did tests.
3609000	3612000	And because of the upset stomach the doctors gave him the okay
3612000	3614000	but they wanted to do X-rays as a precaution.
3614000	3617000	I mean he was like 65, 66 years old.
3617000	3620000	And at the end of the day Tinsley was in a good mood
3620000	3624000	and said, yeah, we'll play again tomorrow.
3624000	3630000	So I thought, dodged a bullet.
3630000	3633000	The next morning Tinsley says I resigned the match
3633000	3636000	and the title and you can't do anything about it.
3636000	3637000	Done.
3637000	3638000	So what's wrong?
3638000	3640000	He said I had my upset stomach again.
3640000	3643000	And I said, but you got your X-ray.
3643000	3644000	We're going to hear the results.
3644000	3646000	And he said, no, we're done.
3646000	3647000	He was adamant we couldn't do it.
3647000	3649000	But he agreed to postpone the announcement of the match
3649000	3652000	until after the X-ray results were known.
3652000	3655000	So I went to the match site and told the rest of my team
3655000	3657000	and we were all upset and we're sitting there
3657000	3660000	and the media is there and spectators are there.
3660000	3661000	What do you do?
3661000	3663000	We're all set up to play and there's no Tinsley
3663000	3665000	and we're not going to announce that he's resigned
3665000	3667000	because he agreed to postpone it.
3667000	3668000	What happens?
3668000	3670000	Tinsley shows up.
3670000	3671000	What does he want to do?
3671000	3672000	He wants to play checkers.
3672000	3673000	Not a game.
3673000	3675000	He wants to analyze some positions.
3675000	3678000	So we sit there for an hour analyzing positions
3678000	3680000	and the match arbiter comes in and says, what the hell is going on?
3680000	3681000	I said, we're playing checkers with Tinsley.
3681000	3685000	And he said, the guy is apparently too sick to play the match
3685000	3686000	that he's resigning.
3686000	3688000	What's he doing here?
3688000	3690000	And I said, that's what he wants to do.
3690000	3692000	And he said, well, what were the results of the X-ray?
3692000	3693000	And I said, I don't know.
3693000	3694000	He hasn't called.
3694000	3698000	So the arbiter goes up and says, why haven't you called
3698000	3699000	about the X-rays?
3699000	3701000	And he says, well, I'll call now.
3701000	3706000	So he disappears and we're all sort of perplexed at his behavior.
3706000	3709000	Tinsley makes the phone call, comes back.
3709000	3711000	And I said, well, what were the X-ray results?
3711000	3715000	And he said, ah, they found a lump on my pancreas.
3715000	3717000	Yeah, no big deal.
3717000	3718000	You see, bright and cheery.
3718000	3721000	Now, if it was me, I would have been scared to death.
3721000	3724000	A lump on my pancreas, that doesn't sound good.
3724000	3730000	But the match officials sent him home because they're
3730000	3732000	about to announce that he's too sick to play.
3732000	3735000	And you couldn't have somebody too sick to play sitting there
3735000	3737000	playing checkers.
3737000	3739000	He refused to continue.
3739000	3742000	And we won the world championship after six games,
3742000	3746000	all draws on forfeit.
3746000	3750000	What do you do when you're in Boston all set up for a world
3750000	3752000	championship and you have nothing to do?
3752000	3755000	Tinsley said, why don't you bring in Don Lafferty,
3755000	3759000	the world's number two player, and play an exhibition match?
3759000	3760000	We were so upset.
3760000	3762000	We just wanted to go home.
3762000	3763000	We played Lafferty.
3763000	3765000	We lost a game.
3765000	3768000	We've gone like 150 games without a loss.
3768000	3771000	I've been so careful in testing the program.
3771000	3774000	A couple weeks before, I found something wrong.
3774000	3776000	And I've been in a rush and I fixed it.
3776000	3779000	And I had an if statement, which had an and in it.
3779000	3781000	And it should have had an or.
3781000	3783000	And I hadn't tested it.
3783000	3785000	And we lost the game.
3785000	3787000	We won another game.
3787000	3790000	Lafferty played boring checkers to draw every game.
3790000	3793000	So it was a drawn match and we retained the title.
3793000	3796000	So we win it on forfeit and we retain it with a draw.
3796000	3798000	It was absolutely terrible.
3798000	3800000	Then the American Checker Federation and the English
3800000	3803000	Drafts Association threatened us with legal action.
3803000	3805000	Of course, there was a contract that said whoever wins
3805000	3808000	the match is world champion, but they threatened us
3808000	3809000	with legal action.
3809000	3812000	And then they wrote angry letters to my chair,
3812000	3815000	my dean, my university president, and the media.
3815000	3819000	There was an anti-Shanuk internet campaign.
3819000	3822000	It was a horrible time.
3822000	3826000	In 1995, January, we played another match against Lafferty
3826000	3829000	and we beat him.
3829000	3833000	In April 1995, Tinsley unfortunately passed away.
3833000	3835000	It turned out that that lump on his pancreas
3835000	3838000	was pancreatic cancer and he passed away.
3838000	3844000	And in 1996, Shanuk was crushing everybody.
3844000	3848000	Because nobody was even close to Tinsley.
3848000	3851000	In the U.S. championship, there were 32 games.
3851000	3854000	It scored 30 out of 32 points.
3854000	3857000	Second place scored 22 out of 32 points.
3857000	3860000	I mean, the gap was so huge.
3860000	3863000	It was a horrible time.
3863000	3866000	And we got lots of accolades which made things better.
3866000	3869000	First computer to win a human world championship in any game.
3869000	3871000	It's from the Guinness Book of World Records.
3871000	3874000	We're a trivial pursuit question, which is kind of cool.
3874000	3877000	We're on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
3877000	3879000	A popular game show from a few years back.
3879000	3882000	It was a $16,000, only $16,000 question.
3882000	3883000	Come on.
3883000	3886000	But for me, there was still a sense of unfinished business.
3886000	3890000	I'm over time, so I will speed up and finish this talk.
3890000	3892000	My apologies.
3892000	3895000	But then I started getting all the hate mail
3895000	3897000	from the checkers player.
3897000	3900000	Shanuk doesn't hold a candle to Tinsley.
3900000	3903000	In his prime, Tinsley would crush Shanuk.
3903000	3906000	You know, Tinsley was almost perfect.
3906000	3908000	He did lose three games.
3908000	3910000	He wasn't perfect.
3910000	3913000	And if I wanted to prove to everybody that my program was
3913000	3918000	better than humans, I had to be better than Tinsley.
3918000	3923000	If he was almost perfect, I had to be perfect.
3923000	3926000	So I had to solve the game of checkers.
3926000	3929000	There are some games that you can solve that are simpler.
3929000	3933000	They have smaller search complexity or decision complexity.
3933000	3937000	Checkers is 500 billion billion positions.
3937000	3938000	That's a big number.
3938000	3941000	I'm sure you have no idea how to comprehend a number like that,
3941000	3943000	but I'll give you a good example.
3943000	3945000	Let's take the Pacific Ocean.
3945000	3948000	And I know that you probably don't study oceanography,
3948000	3951000	but if you go to the deepest part, there's actually a big plug there.
3951000	3954000	And if you remove the plug and drain all the water,
3954000	3957000	it's really a big sink, and you drain all the water
3957000	3959000	and it's empty and you put the plug back in,
3959000	3963000	now your task is to refill the Pacific Ocean.
3963000	3966000	So we're going to give you a house in Seattle.
3966000	3969000	You can turn on the tap and I'm going to give you a teaspoon.
3969000	3972000	You can put the teaspoon underneath the tap,
3972000	3974000	walk over to the Pacific Ocean,
3974000	3977000	and dump the teaspoon into the Pacific Ocean.
3977000	3980000	And then go back and fill another teaspoon with water
3980000	3984000	and go over to the Pacific Ocean and dump it in.
3984000	3987000	If you do it roughly this number of times,
3987000	3990000	you will refill the Pacific Ocean.
3990000	3995000	I'll leave that as an exercise for the ambitious student.
3996000	3999000	Basically, for a non-trivial game,
3999000	4002000	checkers was 10 to the 7 times bigger than Awari,
4002000	4004000	which had been solved.
4004000	4007000	So we're talking about 10 million times bigger.
4007000	4011000	And I said, I'm going to solve this problem.
4011000	4013000	And I'm going to do it.
4013000	4016000	And people said, well, why don't you do it incrementally,
4016000	4017000	bits at a time?
4017000	4018000	I said, no.
4018000	4023000	My goal is I want one fantastic paper in science.
4023000	4025000	That's my goal.
4025000	4029000	And then I got a review back saying,
4029000	4031000	what a moron, Jonathan.
4031000	4033000	Don't you know how to play the publishing game?
4033000	4036000	You're supposed to take what you got and make it 10%
4036000	4038000	better or bigger, and then you publish a paper.
4038000	4041000	And then you take that and you make it 10% or 20% better,
4041000	4043000	and you publish another paper.
4043000	4045000	You can milk this for a dozen papers.
4045000	4047000	And I said, no.
4047000	4048000	I'm not going to waste my time.
4048000	4050000	I'm not interested in the papers.
4050000	4053000	I want that one nugget of gold at the end.
4053000	4055000	I want a paper in science.
4060000	4062000	So I continued computing end game databases.
4062000	4064000	They started in 1989.
4064000	4067000	At various points, they were running on hundreds of processes
4067000	4068000	around the world.
4068000	4073000	And eventually, I computed up to all positions with 10 or fewer
4073000	4075000	positions on the board.
4075000	4076000	Let's see.
4076000	4081000	Not 1,000 or 1,000,000 or 1,000,000 trillion.
4081000	4086000	39 trillion positions in the program's memory.
4086000	4089000	If ever you do the analysis and you come down to 10 positions
4089000	4092000	or 10 pieces or less, you know the exact answer.
4092000	4094000	Win, loss, or draw.
4094000	4096000	Here's an example of the databases.
4096000	4097000	This is a famous example.
4097000	4099000	It's called the 100-year position.
4099000	4101000	White to move and win.
4101000	4103000	You don't care much about the position.
4103000	4106000	The point was this was posed in the year 1800.
4106000	4107000	And this is pre-internet.
4107000	4109000	Yes, there is something called pre-internet.
4109000	4112000	But pre-internet days where this position was heavily
4112000	4114000	discussed in chess magazines.
4114000	4117000	So somebody in the year 1800 published this and said,
4117000	4119000	I think white wins.
4119000	4121000	And like six months later in another magazine,
4121000	4124000	somebody published an analysis that said, no, it's a draw.
4124000	4126000	And two years later in another magazine,
4126000	4129000	somebody published an analysis and said it's win.
4129000	4131000	This went on for 100 years back and forth in magazines
4131000	4134000	before they concluded it's a win.
4134000	4136000	Grandmaster Don Lafferty gave it to me and he said,
4136000	4138000	you know, there's 10 pieces on the board.
4138000	4141000	You should be able to look it up in your database.
4143000	4146000	What's the result for the 100-year position?
4146000	4150000	We looked it up and it's a draw.
4150000	4156000	And it turns out that on the third move of the analysis,
4157000	4161000	black has to play an unhuman-like move.
4161000	4164000	And once Don Lafferty saw what it was,
4164000	4165000	he went like this.
4165000	4168000	Now it's obvious it's a draw.
4168000	4170000	But it wasn't obvious before because the computer
4170000	4173000	looks at everything and humans are biased.
4173000	4176000	It's now called the 197-year position because the first
4176000	4182000	publication was in the year 1800 and in 1997 we solved it.
4182000	4184000	Here's how we did the solving.
4184000	4189000	This is 24 pieces on the board down to zero.
4189000	4192000	The width here is the log of the search space.
4192000	4194000	So you can see that it's pretty wide here
4194000	4200000	because the log is like two and then three and bigger.
4200000	4207000	And the widest is at 24 or actually 23 is the biggest size.
4207000	4210000	Whenever you get down to 10 pieces or less,
4210000	4212000	we look it up in the database.
4212000	4214000	Here's the perfect information.
4214000	4218000	I had a master process that was maintaining the main line
4218000	4219000	of play.
4219000	4221000	It would decide what pieces of work
4221000	4225000	needed to be done to prove or disprove whether a line of play
4225000	4226000	was good or not.
4226000	4228000	Each of those dots represents a piece of work.
4228000	4232000	I had hundreds of processors that would pick off pieces of work
4232000	4237000	like this one, grab it, do the work, send the result back,
4237000	4239000	which would then update this picture.
4239000	4243000	And so for two years this process would continue
4243000	4248000	as we refined the strategy.
4248000	4252000	Processors working in parallel for two years.
4252000	4257000	The longest line in the proof was 154 moves.
4257000	4260000	At the end of it was a position that was searched
4260000	4262000	possibly more than 30 moves.
4262000	4264000	At the end of it was a database position
4264000	4267000	which may have been searched to 250 moves deep.
4267000	4271000	In other words, it's possible that the longest line
4271000	4273000	in the actual proof from the start of the game
4273000	4277000	to the literal end of the game was well over 400 moves.
4277000	4279000	And it was a smart search because I put a lot of effort
4279000	4281000	into refining the search algorithms.
4281000	4284000	Even though the search space was 10 to the 20th,
4284000	4287000	we only had to look at 10 to the 14th positions
4287000	4288000	in order to do the proof.
4288000	4291000	Huge, huge reduction in search space.
4291000	4294000	I want to throw this in just as a warning.
4294000	4298000	This was as much research in AI as it was in reliable systems
4298000	4301000	because you have to be careful of disk IO failures.
4301000	4303000	I mean, I told you I had a database full of null bytes.
4303000	4304000	What the hell happened there?
4304000	4305000	I don't know.
4305000	4308000	Network failures, memory parity errors.
4308000	4312000	Somebody tried to reproduce my results
4312000	4314000	and we got different results and we tracked it back
4314000	4317000	and it turned out that in 1992 one of my computations
4317000	4320000	was correct and I had it on my disk.
4320000	4323000	And then six years later when I looked at it,
4323000	4327000	one bit in the database had changed, one bit.
4327000	4329000	And it was wrong.
4329000	4332000	And all my computations that depended on that data since then
4332000	4334000	were now flawed and had to be redone,
4334000	4338000	which meant every day I would do a verification
4338000	4340000	that the data had not changed.
4340000	4343000	And every few months you would find that a bit would be flipped.
4343000	4345000	It's perfectly normal.
4345000	4346000	It happens.
4346000	4350000	Discs are not 100% perfect.
4350000	4353000	They're bugs and all sorts of other problems.
4353000	4356000	So if you want to say that you're proving something,
4356000	4358000	you've got to be 100% correct,
4358000	4360000	100% is a pretty high standard.
4360000	4363000	So, punch line.
4363000	4364000	Ta-da.
4364000	4367000	And it's literally ta-da.
4367000	4370000	Because I wrote a script to do all of this
4370000	4372000	and if it ever reached the end of the script,
4372000	4374000	it was to send me an email.
4374000	4378000	And the email only said ta-da.
4378000	4382000	And I got an email one day saying ta-da.
4382000	4386000	So, here's the punch line.
4386000	4388000	If neither side makes a mistake,
4388000	4391000	then a game of checkers will end in a draw.
4391000	4395000	Perfect play by both sides leads to a draw.
4395000	4399000	So I now have a theorem that perfect play leads to a draw
4399000	4401000	and the proof is constructive.
4401000	4403000	I have a construction.
4403000	4405000	The formal proof fits up on my web
4405000	4408000	and you can actually go through it and see the proof.
4408000	4410000	But I have something that most people don't have
4410000	4412000	when they do a proof.
4412000	4415000	My proof completed on April the 29th,
4415000	4419000	2007 at 5.01 p.m. California time.
4419000	4423000	I was in California with my daughter and I had an urge.
4423000	4427000	I said, Rebecca, I need to check on the checkers computations.
4427000	4429000	I need to check in on the checkers computations.
4429000	4431000	So we checked into a hotel
4431000	4434000	and I went up and hooked up my computer and logged in.
4435000	4438000	And was pissed off because all the computers were down.
4438000	4442000	And I was about to restart them when I looked at the log file.
4445000	4447000	That was the time stamp.
4447000	4449000	The computation had ended.
4449000	4452000	And what shocked me, you know I said I had this feeling
4452000	4454000	I had to log in?
4455000	4462000	The computation had ended one minute before I looked at this file.
4463000	4467000	Which meant I was literally online checking to see what was going on
4467000	4470000	within 60 seconds of the computation ended.
4470000	4473000	And what's even weirder, I'm in California.
4473000	4476000	My postdoc who was working with me was in Edmonton.
4476000	4478000	He had this funny feeling too.
4478000	4481000	And he logged in at the same time.
4481000	4484000	And we were chatting back and forth within like two minutes
4484000	4486000	of the computation ending.
4486000	4488000	It was absolutely bizarre.
4488000	4496000	So the corollary is that because perfect play leads to a draw
4496000	4499000	the corollary is that Chinook will never lose.
4499000	4501000	Never lose.
4501000	4507000	And so the implication is that Tinsley occasionally made a mistake.
4507000	4516000	Therefore being human I now know that my program is better than Tinsley.
4518000	4521000	Not the easiest way to do that.
4522000	4524000	Some recognition.
4524000	4527000	I published my paper in Science.
4527000	4529000	And Science and Nature Ranked.
4529000	4532000	It was one of the top ten breakthroughs for 2007.
4532000	4535000	New York Times ran a great piece in their year-end magazine
4535000	4536000	called The Death of Checkers.
4536000	4538000	And they have this picture that I love.
4538000	4543000	It's meant to be humans being buried under my 40 trillion
4543000	4545000	data-based positions.
4545000	4549000	It's a great example.
4549000	4550000	Last word.
4550000	4552000	This is from my wife.
4552000	4557000	And I don't know why I put this here because she doesn't know me well enough.
4557000	4561000	She said it was 1989, 2007.
4561000	4563000	But that's when we started competing.
4563000	4565000	But it actually started in 1988.
4565000	4567000	She said it's been 18 years.
4567000	4568000	Correct.
4568000	4570000	This is not fake news.
4570000	4571000	Let's deal with facts.
4571000	4572000	18 years.
4572000	4573000	Correct.
4573000	4576000	Obsessive compulsive behavior.
4576000	4578000	That is not correct.
4578000	4581000	There is nothing wrong with being passionate about a problem
4581000	4583000	and pursuing it for 18 years.
4583000	4587000	That is not obsessive compulsive behavior.
4587000	4589000	Now this really hurt.
4589000	4592000	Not normal.
4592000	4595000	The commitment to scientific purity.
4595000	4598000	She did not understand how important it was
4598000	4602000	the standard to reach 100%.
4602000	4604000	Scientists are perfectionists.
4604000	4606000	We want to leave our mark.
4606000	4609000	But then she struck below the bell.
4609000	4615000	Get a life, Jonathan.
4615000	4619000	OK.
4619000	4623000	Well, I hate to say it, but you really didn't think
4623000	4626000	I'd give my wife the last word, did you?
4626000	4629000	The other was the end of the project, but I lied.
4629000	4631000	I took my book from One Jump Ahead,
4631000	4634000	which was Challenging Human Supremacy at Checkers.
4634000	4637000	And then I updated it and added the next 10 years
4637000	4640000	and it became One Jump Ahead Computer Perfection at Checkers.
4640000	4643000	And that came out in 2008.
4643000	4645000	So this is a story.
4645000	4650000	It technically ends in 2008, but it doesn't end.
4650000	4654000	There's rarely a week that goes by when I don't get
4654000	4659000	a computer scientist or a checker player or a media or whatever.
4659000	4662000	And it's only with hindsight that I can look back
4662000	4665000	and I say I went through an amazing experience,
4665000	4669000	something that was life-altering to me
4669000	4672000	and has had profound implications for my life
4672000	4674000	and how I live it.
4674000	4679000	And I feel privileged to have known Marion Tinsley
4679000	4684000	and have gone through this obsessive compulsive quest.
4684000	4688000	So thank you for your interest in my apologies for going over.
4688000	4692000	I have lots more stories and I just, you know,
4692000	4694000	it brings back memories to give this talk.
4694000	4698000	I give this talk three, four times a year now still
4698000	4702000	and even some groups have asked me to give it again and saying,
4702000	4704000	you know, you told us those stories last time.
4704000	4707000	We want to hear new stories because there are lots of other stories.
4707000	4708000	So who knows?
4708000	4709000	So thank you very much.
4709000	4711000	And, you know, please feel free to leave.
4711000	4713000	You've been great staying as long,
4713000	4715000	but I'm happy to stay around as long as necessary
4715000	4717000	and answer whatever questions you have.
4717000	4718000	Thank you.
4718000	4726000	Let's do a few questions at least and we'll see where it goes.
4726000	4727000	Questions? Yes, sir.
4727000	4728000	Do you want an update on the chess game?
4728000	4729000	Sure.
4729000	4731000	They're still playing.
4731000	4734000	Is it a draw?
4734000	4735000	Okay.
4735000	4739000	This is the match between American Fabiano Calrana
4739000	4743000	and Norwegian Magnus Carlsen for the World Chess Championship.
4743000	4746000	It just happened to have started today.
4746000	4748000	It's going on in London.
4748000	4751000	The one move was a white to D4.
4751000	4753000	Yeah, not a surprise.
4753000	4754000	Yes.
4754000	4756000	So when you're faced with, you know,
4756000	4758000	a question that is massive is, you know,
4758000	4761000	even just starting to write a program that could play chess
4761000	4763000	or it could play it candidly.
4763000	4765000	What was, like, what are the first steps
4765000	4766000	of being taken?
4766000	4768000	How do you approach starting a problem,
4768000	4770000	like picking out a problem like that?
4770000	4772000	Well, first of all, I didn't know it was going to be this big
4772000	4775000	of a problem, so I might have done it differently.
4775000	4780000	And what I did is I just wrote actually a very simple program
4780000	4788000	to just play legal moves and display things
4788000	4790000	just to see how much work it was
4790000	4792000	and whether it was interesting or not.
4792000	4794000	If I was going to undertake anything big,
4794000	4797000	I had to do something that I thought was interesting.
4797000	4800000	So by just doing something really small,
4800000	4802000	like just making moves on the checkerboard
4802000	4804000	was my interest still.
4804000	4806000	You know, I've taken on a lot of projects
4806000	4809000	and I start programming them and then I lose interest
4809000	4811000	and then you never finish the code.
4811000	4817000	And so I need to do something with it
4817000	4821000	that keeps the momentum going
4821000	4824000	because the more you get involved with something,
4824000	4827000	the more that you're going to end up putting into it
4827000	4829000	and I don't want to invest my time and effort
4829000	4832000	on something frivolous that I'm going to drop
4832000	4835000	a day, a week, a month later.
4835000	4837000	And I've done a few of those things
4837000	4839000	and, you know, I've regretted the time.
4839000	4841000	I mean, we've done this and, you know,
4841000	4843000	I seem to be addicted to long-running projects.
4843000	4846000	Our poker project started in 1995
4846000	4849000	and ended earlier this year, so that's 23 years.
4849000	4851000	So it even trumps the...
4851000	4853000	Oh, I can't say that.
4853000	4858000	It even is longer than the checker's project, right?
4858000	4864000	So you've got to be not obsessive.
4864000	4866000	Determined.
4866000	4870000	And once I think something's worthwhile,
4870000	4872000	then I'll pour my heart and soul into it,
4872000	4874000	but I've got to get to the point where I see
4874000	4876000	that I want that commitment.
4876000	4877000	Yes?
4877000	4879000	Do you have anyone trying to challenge Chinook nowadays?
4879000	4881000	No. I mean, it's perfect.
4881000	4885000	So you can play Chinook, but you'll never win.
4885000	4887000	We have Chinook online.
4887000	4891000	It goes on and off online
4891000	4893000	because the hardware we have right now
4893000	4895000	is getting old and failing, so I haven't replaced it.
4895000	4899000	And there are strong humans that continue to like to play against it,
4899000	4901000	using it as a sparring partner.
4901000	4907000	But, you know, the game is over from the computer science point of view.
4907000	4909000	There's nothing interesting left to do.
4909000	4910000	Actually, that's not true.
4910000	4912000	There is one thing interesting left to do,
4912000	4915000	and that's, if you don't mind, I'll add some technical stuff.
4915000	4920000	Just one thing.
4920000	4922000	This interests me, and this...
4922000	4924000	Why does this interest me?
4924000	4927000	Well, Marion Tinsley, or any checker player, or chess player,
4927000	4931000	they're really good at playing chess, or checkers,
4931000	4934000	and they're not going to memorize 40 trillion positions.
4934000	4936000	How do you play a game?
4936000	4937000	You use heuristics.
4937000	4939000	You know, in chess, you might say,
4939000	4941000	it's good to centralize my pieces,
4941000	4943000	or I need to do king safety.
4943000	4945000	You come up with heuristics,
4945000	4948000	and I can explain a lot of those heuristics to you.
4948000	4951000	But if I ask, if I gave you a position
4951000	4954000	with four white pieces versus four black pieces,
4954000	4956000	and I say, oh, you know, here it is in the database,
4956000	4957000	it's a win.
4957000	4960000	And the human says, why?
4960000	4961000	I say, I have no idea.
4961000	4963000	The program says it's a win.
4963000	4966000	So what I really want to do, and I'm going to try that this year,
4966000	4969000	and I've tried before, and it's failed,
4969000	4971000	but with all the hype about deep learning,
4971000	4973000	I want to try deep learning on this,
4973000	4977000	I want to see if I can take something like one of these databases
4977000	4979000	and run it through a learning algorithm
4979000	4982000	and try and compress it into a smaller number
4982000	4986000	of explainable heuristics
4986000	4991000	so that I could use this to write a book.
4991000	4993000	So you want to learn how to play the checker end games?
4993000	4996000	I have this program, I run it, and it will tell you
4996000	4998000	you should do the following things
4998000	5000000	if you're going to win the position.
5000000	5002000	And I can't do that right now.
5002000	5005000	And so I've got a lot of data, but I have no knowledge.
5005000	5007000	And humans need knowledge, not data.
5007000	5009000	I'd love to be able to do that.
5009000	5010000	Yes, sir.
5010000	5015000	Like you said, no one's going to memorize 40 trillion positions.
5015000	5021000	So I guess my question is, what sort of long-term effect
5021000	5025000	do you think this will have on checkers at the highest level?
5025000	5026000	They still play.
5026000	5030000	But checkers is not so popular.
5030000	5032000	It's a dying game now.
5033000	5038000	If you look at the worldwide number of people in the American
5038000	5041000	and the checker federations, you're talking about
5041000	5043000	a few tens of thousands of people.
5043000	5048000	Whereas in chess, worldwide, you're talking maybe a few million people.
5048000	5051000	So checkers has been dwarfed by chess
5051000	5053000	and checkers is not going to recover.
5053000	5055000	It's a fun game.
5055000	5057000	It's a challenging game.
5057000	5059000	The rules are very simple and elegant,
5059000	5061000	but it has not attracted people's attention.
5061000	5066000	So that game is just slowly disappearing.
5066000	5079000	I guess to clarify, do you think that we can derive any benefit personally
5079000	5084000	from solving these sorts of geometric puzzles like chess?
5084000	5087000	What do you mean?
5087000	5089000	Research-wise, what are the outcomes
5089000	5092000	for solving something like that?
5092000	5102000	I'm just saying hypothetically, it's possible to solve the chess puzzle.
5102000	5112000	So just using chess as the example, since it's the more popular of the two,
5112000	5118000	I guess I'm just wondering if this would make the world of chess a better place.
5118000	5121000	Solving it, I don't think it makes a difference.
5121000	5125000	I mean, we have superhuman chess playing programs and nobody cares.
5125000	5127000	They use them as sparring partners.
5127000	5130000	But solving chess would be interesting.
5130000	5135000	And solving checkers was interesting at one point.
5135000	5140000	Sorry, I'm just trying to get to here.
5140000	5145000	One of the effects of this is DARPA held two workshops
5145000	5147000	on solving games of national importance.
5147000	5150000	And this was because of the work that we were doing on chess and checkers,
5150000	5152000	which were very large search spaces.
5152000	5156000	And it turns out that a lot of real-world problems can be couched as games.
5156000	5158000	Politics is a game.
5158000	5160000	Military is a game.
5160000	5166000	Certain kinds of legislation laws, like environmental laws, can be couched as a game.
5166000	5169000	The way animals interact is a game.
5169000	5171000	The economy is a game.
5171000	5175000	Multiple players, imperfect information, things like that.
5175000	5178000	And DARPA was interested in how do we take games,
5178000	5183000	like we'd solve the game of 10 to the 20th, which for 2007 is like a massive,
5183000	5186000	is the biggest computational problem solved today.
5186000	5190000	And DARPA had done the work to take some real-world games
5190000	5193000	and try and express real-world problems and express them as games,
5193000	5196000	and they were coming up with 10 to the 100th.
5196000	5200000	So how do you get from solving games of size 10 to the 20th to 10 to the 100th?
5200000	5202000	Oh, it's only a factor of five, right?
5202000	5204000	No, it's not a factor of five.
5204000	5206000	It's much, much bigger than that.
5206000	5210000	And so solving games, bigger games like chess would be amazing
5210000	5214000	because although the actual solving of chess,
5214000	5218000	do we really care whether chess with perfect play is a draw or not?
5218000	5220000	No. Do we care that checkers is a draw or not?
5220000	5221000	No.
5221000	5224000	It's about what are the techniques and the technologies
5224000	5229000	that you would allow you to get to solve such really hard and complex problems.
5229000	5231000	And again, like I said at the beginning,
5231000	5234000	I want to emphasize this is not about games.
5234000	5239000	It's about general-purpose techniques that you can use for other applications.
5239000	5243000	This one, my talk became much more personal,
5243000	5246000	so there was obviously a large game component in my talk,
5246000	5251000	but the end result had to be papers that were generally applicable.
5252000	5254000	Did I have it?
5269000	5273000	Most interesting result that has used my research.
5277000	5280000	Well, let me tell you one thing that was completely unexpected
5280000	5283000	and it goes back to this slide.
5287000	5291000	So you look at that and you say, OK, it's a big number.
5291000	5294000	But remember, we're talking about, years ago,
5294000	5297000	we're not talking about cheap gigabyte disks.
5297000	5300000	And how many what?
5300000	5304000	That's a billion, so we're talking about 39,000 gigabytes
5304000	5306000	or 39 terabytes.
5306000	5309000	Well, back then it was $5,000 for a gigabyte.
5309000	5311000	I'm not going to afford a terabyte.
5311000	5312000	It couldn't.
5312000	5314000	So I spent a lot of time and effort,
5314000	5316000	which has nothing to do with AI,
5316000	5318000	in coming up with compression algorithms.
5318000	5337000	So this whole stuff got compressed down to six gigabytes.
5337000	5339000	I had to invent new compression algorithms,
5339000	5342000	application dependent, massive amount of compression,
5342000	5345000	and then doing real time searching on it
5345000	5346000	because you're playing a game,
5346000	5347000	which means you come across a business,
5347000	5351000	you got to go and you got to decompress part of the file,
5351000	5352000	extract the information.
5352000	5356000	You can't take a six gigabyte file and just unzip it
5356000	5358000	and then look up a position and zip it.
5358000	5359000	But you can't.
5359000	5361000	So you got to take pieces and decompress them,
5361000	5362000	pull things out.
5362000	5364000	And OK, fine.
5364000	5368000	So I developed this technology and thought nothing of it
5368000	5372000	until a couple years after the Second Tinsley match
5372000	5375000	when two biochemists walked into my office and said,
5375000	5378000	you know, we know what you did with the checkers program
5378000	5383000	and we think it has applications to bioinformatics.
5383000	5385000	Well, I don't know much about bioinformatics.
5385000	5388000	I hated my undergrad biology course.
5388000	5391000	And he said, well, let's not talk about checker positions
5391000	5393000	when lost draw.
5393000	5399000	Let's talk about the letters, ACGT, DNA.
5399000	5404000	Well, your database is just a string of wins, lost draws,
5404000	5406000	but it could be ACGT.
5406000	5408000	And if we gave you large data, could you compress it?
5408000	5411000	Similarly, I said, well, yeah, we could try that out.
5411000	5413000	And he said, well, and if you have large data
5413000	5415000	and you compressed it, could we use some of your technology
5415000	5419000	to in real time go and search it and pull information out?
5419000	5420000	I said, sure.
5420000	5424000	He said, OK, well, we're working on the human genome project.
5424000	5428000	We're generating massive amounts of ACGT data
5428000	5433000	and we want to have these programs be able to analyze this data
5433000	5435000	in real time.
5435000	5440000	And instead of using big, massive data servers,
5440000	5442000	we want this all compressed on something that somebody
5442000	5446000	could do something on their laptop.
5446000	5449000	Huh, we talked about it.
5449000	5452000	Within six months, we formed a company called Biotools.
5452000	5456000	And we developed three products, Peptool, GeneTool,
5456000	5460000	and Chromotool, which did protein and DNA analysis.
5460000	5463000	And we sold those products to thousands of research labs
5463000	5464000	around the world.
5464000	5470000	And I was very proud of it that here was DNA protein analysis
5470000	5474000	software with checkers inside.
5474000	5478000	And I never would have made that connection.
5478000	5481000	And so, yeah, we did it.
5481000	5482000	We made a bit of money.
5482000	5484000	We sold the company.
5484000	5489000	And in many ways, I'm proud of it because one of the major
5489000	5494000	companies who did a lot of the DNA analysis used our software
5494000	5498000	and they were very complimentary about how much it helped
5498000	5500000	speed up their processes.
5500000	5504000	And so it's kind of an odd story.
5504000	5507000	But you never know where technology is going to go.
5507000	5509000	And that's cool.
5509000	5514000	I guess the other story I like, which was really good to me,
5514000	5516000	is I've developed a lot of pathfinding algorithms.
5516000	5518000	And you go in and you publish them.
5518000	5521000	These pathfinding algorithms can be used in GPS systems,
5521000	5525000	but I often use these examples in computer games.
5525000	5529000	And we develop an algorithm, a hierarchical pathfinding that
5529000	5530000	was very fast.
5530000	5536000	And at a conference called AIID, Artificial Intelligence
5536000	5539000	Interactive Digital Entertainment, which is on my mind
5539000	5542000	because we're hosting it next week in Edmonton.
5542000	5545000	But at one of the conferences, one of the major computer games
5545000	5547000	companies, the guy comes up to me and says, yeah,
5547000	5550000	we really like your hierarchical pathfinding.
5550000	5553000	We use it for all of our pathfinding in games.
5553000	5557000	And I thought, wow, how cool is that that this multi-gazillion
5557000	5562000	billion dollar company and my software, my algorithm,
5562000	5567000	is in their products that sell 10, 20, 50 million copies.
5567000	5568000	I wrote Chinook.
5568000	5570000	How many people in the world have ever played against Chinook?
5570000	5571000	Not many.
5571000	5573000	How many people have played these games?
5573000	5575000	Tens or hundreds of millions of people.
5575000	5576000	And I thought, that's cool.
5576000	5581000	Now, how about a royalty that didn't get anything?
5581000	5585000	That's part of the problem of being an academic is you publish
5585000	5587000	things and you never know how they're going to be used
5587000	5590000	and you never know if they're going to be used.
5591000	5593000	But finally, when you get that kind of feedback,
5593000	5595000	it's very, very rewarding.
5598000	5599000	Yes, sir?
5599000	5603000	I think it would be ironic if your compression helped
5603000	5605000	solve pancreatic cancer.
5609000	5615000	The other question is, well, these long projects seem like
5615000	5619000	something you could only do after you got tenure.
5620000	5626000	How could anybody, I mean, how could you keep your
5626000	5631000	department happy if you're just playing checkers all the time?
5633000	5634000	So that's a good point.
5634000	5636000	I actually started this project in 88 and I did not get
5636000	5639000	tenure until 89, but that was close enough.
5639000	5640000	You raised a good point.
5640000	5643000	I kept my research group going and I had other projects
5643000	5645000	on the go, but this was my passion.
5645000	5648000	This is where I poured most of my time and effort into it.
5648000	5652000	But the interesting thing is that the two years where I put
5652000	5656000	the most time and effort, which was 1992 for the first match
5656000	5659000	against Tinsley in 1994, which is the second match of the
5659000	5664000	Tinsley, there I poured my heart and soul into those efforts
5664000	5668000	and there were almost no publications that year because
5668000	5670000	of doing this.
5670000	5674000	And those are the only two years in my academic career where
5675000	5680000	I got substandard evaluations because I wasn't publishing.
5685000	5689000	It sort of reinforced the publisher paradigm.
5689000	5692000	If you didn't publish, well, sorry, but I was doing something
5692000	5695000	that I felt was bigger and in the long run I was right.
5695000	5697000	But you're absolutely right.
5697000	5700000	Most people can't commit to this type of thing at an early
5700000	5701000	stage of their career.
5701000	5703000	It would be suicide.
5703000	5704000	Oh, sorry.
5704000	5708000	It would be professional suicide.
5708000	5711000	I've got to be careful what I say, especially to graduate
5711000	5713000	students.
5713000	5714000	Yes, other questions?
5717000	5718000	Thank you again.
5718000	5719000	Thank you.
5719000	5723000	Give you a small applause from the department.
5723000	5724000	Wonderful.
5724000	5725000	Thank you.
5725000	5726000	My pleasure.
