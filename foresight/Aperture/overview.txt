1. **Artists' Concerns**: Visual artists and now other creators are worried about copyright infringement and theft of ideas as AI technologies like chatGPT and Syndesia can create content using copyrighted works without consent.

2. **Voice Clone Issue**: The case of Eleven Labs, which allows users to generate voice clips with uploaded recordings, leading to scenarios where deceased individuals like John Bain (Total Biscuit) are impersonated to spread hate speech or misinformation.

3. **Celebrity Impersonation**: Other celebrities have been impersonated by AI, including Emma Watson and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who were made to say inflammatory and inappropriate things.

4. **Government Propaganda**: Governments are already using generative AI to create propaganda videos, as seen with a Burkina Faso military dictatorship and Venezuela's state-run television.

5. **Future of AI**: The technology is rapidly advancing towards creating avatars that are indistinguishable from real humans, raising concerns about distinguishing between human and AI content.

6. **Opportunities for Creators**: Generative AI opens up new creative opportunities for individuals to produce media without the need for traditional resources like writers, actors, or film crews.

7. **Potential for Abuse**: The risks of generative AI include unauthorized use of personal likenesses and copyrighted material, with potential for widespread impact on the American workforce as claimed by OpenAI.

8. **Need for Guardrails and Legislation**: There is a call for stronger regulation to protect artists' work and individuals' likenesses, along with responsible use of AI technology by companies.

9. **Transparency and Ethical Use**: Companies should operate transparently, and there should be ethical considerations in the development and deployment of generative AI technologies.

10. **Overall Impact**: The potential impact of generative AI on society is significant, with implications for employment, privacy, creativity, and more, necessitating a broader conversation about its role and governance.
