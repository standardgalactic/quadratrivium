00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Hello everyone, I'm Juanita and in this video I'm going to show you how to open

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,440
Spyder and go over the basics of Spyder's interface. We will learn about Spyder's

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,120
four paints that you'll likely be using most often, as well as really explore the

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,800
others that are open by default. If you don't have Spyder installed and would

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,600
like to follow along, you can download it at the link below this video.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,000
The easiest way to open Spyder is by opening Anaconda Navigator and clicking

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,120
on Spyder application once it is open.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,800
In case you have another version of Spyder in Navigator, open the command

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,600
lined or the Anaconda prompt in the case of Windows and type the commands

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,920
conda-update-anaconda and conda-install-spyder-equal-4.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,680
To launch Spyder without opening Navigator, open your command line and

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,000
type Spyder. If you follow the installation guide, you should have

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,200
everything necessary to open Spyder 4.

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,480
This is what Spyder 4 looks like in its default configuration, though you can

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,480
terribly customize it, which we'll get to in a later tutorial. You can see that it

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,600
is divided into three sections showing three different paints, the editor, the

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,560
console, and the help viewer. These three, along with the variable explorer, are the

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,320
four core paints you'll work with the most in Spyder. On the left we have the

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,200
code editor, where you can open, edit, and run files. Bottom right is the ipython

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,680
console, which you can use both interactively and to run your code in the

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,440
editor. It shows you which version of Python you are using. Above it, you'll

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,240
find a help pane, where you can get more information and documentation for any

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,800
object in the editor or console by pressing Ctrl I or Command I in Mac OS.

24
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,040
We'll see how to do this in our next video. For the two sections on the right,

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,800
you can switch tabs to see the other paints that are open by default when

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
launching Spyder. In the top section, you can switch to the variable explorer, which

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,680
shows you the name, type, size, and value of the variables that you have

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,240
previously defined in the editor or the console. You can also modify the value of

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,280
these variables directly from this pane by double-clicking them right under the

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,160
value column. The plots pane will show you the figures you generated with Math.Lift

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,320
and other libraries. And the files pane allows you to browse the files in your

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,440
computer and open them in the editor with just a click. Finally, in the bottom

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,680
section, you can also access the history pane, which shows you the commands you

34
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,680
have entered in the iPython console, including those from previous sessions.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,800
I hope you're now familiar with the basics of using the Spyder interface. In the

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,680
next video, we will start working with Spyder's core paints. Happy Spydering!
