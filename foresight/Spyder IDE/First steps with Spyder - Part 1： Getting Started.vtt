Hello everyone, I'm Juanita and in this video I'm going to show you how to open

00:15.600 --> 00:20.440
Spyder and go over the basics of Spyder's interface. We will learn about Spyder's

00:20.440 --> 00:25.120
four paints that you'll likely be using most often, as well as really explore the

00:25.120 --> 00:29.800
others that are open by default. If you don't have Spyder installed and would

00:29.800 --> 00:34.600
like to follow along, you can download it at the link below this video.

00:34.600 --> 00:40.000
The easiest way to open Spyder is by opening Anaconda Navigator and clicking

00:40.000 --> 00:44.120
on Spyder application once it is open.

00:48.120 --> 00:52.800
In case you have another version of Spyder in Navigator, open the command

00:52.800 --> 00:56.600
lined or the Anaconda prompt in the case of Windows and type the commands

00:56.600 --> 01:01.920
conda-update-anaconda and conda-install-spyder-equal-4.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.680
To launch Spyder without opening Navigator, open your command line and

01:12.680 --> 01:16.000
type Spyder. If you follow the installation guide, you should have

01:16.000 --> 01:20.200
everything necessary to open Spyder 4.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.480
This is what Spyder 4 looks like in its default configuration, though you can

01:26.520 --> 01:31.480
terribly customize it, which we'll get to in a later tutorial. You can see that it

01:31.480 --> 01:35.600
is divided into three sections showing three different paints, the editor, the

01:35.600 --> 01:40.560
console, and the help viewer. These three, along with the variable explorer, are the

01:40.560 --> 01:46.320
four core paints you'll work with the most in Spyder. On the left we have the

01:46.320 --> 01:51.200
code editor, where you can open, edit, and run files. Bottom right is the ipython

01:51.200 --> 01:54.680
console, which you can use both interactively and to run your code in the

01:54.680 --> 01:59.440
editor. It shows you which version of Python you are using. Above it, you'll

01:59.440 --> 02:03.240
find a help pane, where you can get more information and documentation for any

02:03.240 --> 02:07.800
object in the editor or console by pressing Ctrl I or Command I in Mac OS.

02:07.800 --> 02:13.040
We'll see how to do this in our next video. For the two sections on the right,

02:13.040 --> 02:16.800
you can switch tabs to see the other paints that are open by default when

02:16.800 --> 02:21.200
launching Spyder. In the top section, you can switch to the variable explorer, which

02:21.200 --> 02:24.680
shows you the name, type, size, and value of the variables that you have

02:24.680 --> 02:29.240
previously defined in the editor or the console. You can also modify the value of

02:29.240 --> 02:33.280
these variables directly from this pane by double-clicking them right under the

02:33.280 --> 02:38.160
value column. The plots pane will show you the figures you generated with Math.Lift

02:38.160 --> 02:42.320
and other libraries. And the files pane allows you to browse the files in your

02:42.320 --> 02:48.440
computer and open them in the editor with just a click. Finally, in the bottom

02:48.480 --> 02:52.680
section, you can also access the history pane, which shows you the commands you

02:52.680 --> 02:56.680
have entered in the iPython console, including those from previous sessions.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.800
I hope you're now familiar with the basics of using the Spyder interface. In the

03:03.800 --> 03:08.680
next video, we will start working with Spyder's core paints. Happy Spydering!
