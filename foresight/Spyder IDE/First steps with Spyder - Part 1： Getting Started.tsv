0	15600	Hello everyone, I'm Juanita and in this video I'm going to show you how to open
15600	20440	Spyder and go over the basics of Spyder's interface. We will learn about Spyder's
20440	25120	four paints that you'll likely be using most often, as well as really explore the
25120	29800	others that are open by default. If you don't have Spyder installed and would
29800	34600	like to follow along, you can download it at the link below this video.
34600	40000	The easiest way to open Spyder is by opening Anaconda Navigator and clicking
40000	44120	on Spyder application once it is open.
48120	52800	In case you have another version of Spyder in Navigator, open the command
52800	56600	lined or the Anaconda prompt in the case of Windows and type the commands
56600	61920	conda-update-anaconda and conda-install-spyder-equal-4.
68080	72680	To launch Spyder without opening Navigator, open your command line and
72680	76000	type Spyder. If you follow the installation guide, you should have
76000	80200	everything necessary to open Spyder 4.
81200	86480	This is what Spyder 4 looks like in its default configuration, though you can
86520	91480	terribly customize it, which we'll get to in a later tutorial. You can see that it
91480	95600	is divided into three sections showing three different paints, the editor, the
95600	100560	console, and the help viewer. These three, along with the variable explorer, are the
100560	106320	four core paints you'll work with the most in Spyder. On the left we have the
106320	111200	code editor, where you can open, edit, and run files. Bottom right is the ipython
111200	114680	console, which you can use both interactively and to run your code in the
114680	119440	editor. It shows you which version of Python you are using. Above it, you'll
119440	123240	find a help pane, where you can get more information and documentation for any
123240	127800	object in the editor or console by pressing Ctrl I or Command I in Mac OS.
127800	133040	We'll see how to do this in our next video. For the two sections on the right,
133040	136800	you can switch tabs to see the other paints that are open by default when
136800	141200	launching Spyder. In the top section, you can switch to the variable explorer, which
141200	144680	shows you the name, type, size, and value of the variables that you have
144680	149240	previously defined in the editor or the console. You can also modify the value of
149240	153280	these variables directly from this pane by double-clicking them right under the
153280	158160	value column. The plots pane will show you the figures you generated with Math.Lift
158160	162320	and other libraries. And the files pane allows you to browse the files in your
162320	168440	computer and open them in the editor with just a click. Finally, in the bottom
168480	172680	section, you can also access the history pane, which shows you the commands you
172680	176680	have entered in the iPython console, including those from previous sessions.
179680	183800	I hope you're now familiar with the basics of using the Spyder interface. In the
183800	188680	next video, we will start working with Spyder's core paints. Happy Spydering!
