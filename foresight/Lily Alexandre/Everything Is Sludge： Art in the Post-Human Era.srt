1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,560
In 2016 and 2017, journalists noticed that YouTube was serving kids videos of famous

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,960
characters in baffling situations.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,360
Usually these videos were cheap animations, but sometimes they started real people, just

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,060
as Elsa or Spider-Man or whoever, acting out storylines that were always incoherent and

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,940
sometimes disturbing.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,980
The characters would get pregnant, get in car crashes, commit crimes, in some cases be

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,500
buried alive.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,100
The scandal became known as Elsa Gate, and it was possible in part because kids are a

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,300
pretty passive audience.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,020
A video could be a procedurally generated mishmash of characters and songs and bright colors,

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,240
and they would still watch all the way through.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,900
My introduction to Elsa Gate was a great article called Something Is Wrong on the Internet

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,780
by a writer named James Bridal, which pointed out that even beyond Elsa Gate, the entire

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,940
culture of children's YouTube was troubling.

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,700
Some of the most popular videos around were product unboxings.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,620
Kids would watch adults open up kinder eggs or play with toys to the tune of hundreds

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,940
of millions of views.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,020
In an article for New York Magazine, one mom described how toy videos affected her two-year-old,

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,020
saying,

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:29,940
Plus, there's something about seeing your kids sitting still and watching a video of

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,420
somebody playing with toys instead of actually playing with toys themselves that makes you

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,940
feel like the victim of some awful irony of modern life.

23
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,100
The flood of stories was awful PR for YouTube kids, which had just launched a couple years

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,180
earlier and was still trying to win over parents in new markets.

25
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,900
So weirdly not my market.

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,560
YouTube Kids isn't available in Quebec.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,060
Never has been.

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,420
Almost everywhere in North America, just not here specifically.

29
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,980
Francophobia aside, I think YouTubers responded to this scandal pretty well.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,300
They removed thousands of the offending videos, maybe hundreds of thousands, and gave parents

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,500
the option to only show channels that had been manually approved by YouTube staff.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,540
Although I can't verify this because YouTuber Cowards who fear the Kibbutz people, my impression

33
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,100
is that online video isn't a much better place these days.

34
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm glad to say we've left this in- I'm glad to say-

35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,540
If you spend a lot of time on TikTok or anywhere that likes complaining about TikTok, you've

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,420
probably seen a video like this one.

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,620
At the most basic, these videos comprise a clip from a show or movie played next to some

38
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,420
unrelated, visually stimulating footage, sometimes a person playing with slime or cutting

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,780
into soap, but most iconically, screen recordings of the mobile game's subway surfers.

40
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,260
This genre of video is often called sludge content, for the way it combines different

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,380
pieces of media into a pre-digested slurry, where no one component can really be considered

42
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,820
on its own merit.

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,180
Other most chaotic sludge videos feature three videos playing side by side, plus a caption

44
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,140
describing the main video, plus subtitles in English and Chinese, plus grating royalty-free

45
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:24,980
music playing over top, potent enough to tranquilize a cow or kill a German philosopher.

46
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,700
Over the past few months, these videos have gained a reputation as being one, creatively

47
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:37,620
bankrupt, two, incredibly overwhelming, and three, almost impossible to look away from.

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,900
Sludge videos flood people's feeds and rock up millions of views because as widely disdained

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,660
as they are, they're also incredibly easy to watch.

50
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,380
They put viewers in a similar headspace as the Elsa Gate stuff.

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,020
I almost want to say hypnotized, like watching them isn't our choice.

52
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,540
A couple weeks ago, I made a sludge video as a joke for my Patreon, and even though I knew

53
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,660
exactly what it was going to say, I still watched it like four or five times all the

54
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,660
way through.

55
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,220
It's hard to put the experience into words.

56
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,620
When I watch sludge videos, I'm not enjoying myself, I'm not getting anything out of it,

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,340
but it would be tough to say I'm not engaged.

58
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,660
I mean, I'm watching the whole way through with my eyes glued to the screen, despite

59
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,340
none of the interest that would usually keep me around.

60
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,380
It's like something about these videos bypasses the thinking part of my brain and connects

61
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,700
straight to the reward center.

62
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,380
If you think such busy videos would be pure sensory noise, like totally impossible for

63
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:44,100
any human being to parse, but they do a couple things to stay at least kind of legible.

64
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,540
First off, each type of clip that gets used is familiar to anyone who's been on TikTok

65
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,540
or it's competitors, and each one follows a reliable formula.

66
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,900
When you start watching, you know the soap is going to be sliced or the subway is going

67
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,860
to be surfed, so the little side clips don't require your full attention.

68
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,020
A lot of the time, you even know what's going to happen in the show or movie because a text

69
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,140
overlay spoils it for you.

70
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,420
Having that context means that every video kind of feels the same, but it also makes

71
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,580
them easier to digest.

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,220
Of course, more clips also means more stimulation and more payoffs, which is probably the real

73
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,140
reason for this format, even though you know what to expect there's a lot to anticipate.

74
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,820
Those oddly satisfying type videos offer quick and easy payoffs while you wait for the main

75
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,340
clip to resolve.

76
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,060
They keep you watching even if the main clip isn't especially interesting.

77
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,220
On the other hand, a lot of the game footage that gets played never really pays off.

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,500
They tend to be from endless runners that you can actually win, like subway surfers, or

79
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,260
those Minecraft stages that are just a series of tricky jumps.

80
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,340
They offer a baseline of visual interest, but since they never actually finish, since

81
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,700
they never resolve, I'm always left unsatisfied.

82
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,900
Question content sludge is joylessly waiting around for nothing in particular.

83
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,660
I guess the big question there is why, right?

84
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,700
How did such a weird genre take form?

85
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,620
How did it get popular?

86
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,180
Obviously, the answer is money, right?

87
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,060
No one would make this stuff unless they were making money, but even knowing that it's

88
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,660
still kind of baffling, it's like finding out that 5% of your country's GDP comes from

89
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,980
professional jugglers.

90
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,400
How does this, of all things, generate revenue?

91
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,080
This game works by exploiting a couple quirks of the TikTok platform.

92
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,280
First off, with the possible exception of music, TikTok is shockingly lax on copyright.

93
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,120
As far as we know, they don't have any systems in place to screen videos for reposting shows

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
or movies.

95
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,560
This attitude sets them apart from their biggest competitors, Shorts on YouTube, Reels on Instagram

96
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,960
and Facebook, all of which are actively monitored for copyright.

97
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,360
On TikTok, stolen videos run rampant because they can only be taken down by manual reports.

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,680
And I'm told even those are kind of a joke.

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,120
Like Philip from the channel Volksgeist was telling me about a guy who's racked up 70,000

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,680
followers on TikTok by reposting his videos with these stomach-churning, zoom-arc-war-fast

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
edits.

102
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,520
At some points, this account has actively pretended to be the guy in the videos.

103
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
It seems to me like a pretty open and shut case, but Philip reported them to TikTok and

104
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,880
never heard anything back.

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,480
So it's feasible to pirate an entire TV show or movie or YouTube channel or whatever and

106
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,760
rerun it on TikTok for easy money.

107
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,800
On the off chance, you do get caught and your account gets banned.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Who cares?

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Just start another one.

110
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,640
Second, TikTok is exceptionally good at keeping viewers around.

111
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,000
The algorithm's main goal is to maximize viewer retention.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,480
So it pushes videos that people watch to the end and then stay on the app when they're

113
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
finished.

114
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,400
Better retention equals more visibility, equals more views, equals more money.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,800
Retention is a really common metric to measure video quality.

116
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,200
YouTube's waited in some capacity for over a decade now.

117
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,000
And if all the options available, I think it's a pretty good one.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,760
Consider the options here.

119
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,680
If videos got pushed based on the ratio of likes to dislikes, then bragging could easily

120
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,760
tank people's careers.

121
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,720
If went by comments, then inflammatory videos might be pushed over more thoughtful stuff.

122
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,480
In YouTube's case, retention means videos are rewarded for following through on their

123
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
promise.

124
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Watching a video to the end implies you got what you came for.

125
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,040
It's also the reason some videos are like seven hours long these days, which honestly

126
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,400
not everyone can pull off.

127
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,280
I come on here with like one big take every two months and that feels like a bit much

128
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
sometimes.

129
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,720
Any recommendation system will change what kind of content is rewarded, and therefore

130
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,920
what kind of content gets made.

131
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,840
I don't want to go all first year film student.

132
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,280
The medium is the message on you here, but I only did one year film school.

133
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,840
So I'm going to do it anyway.

134
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,840
If you're willing to sacrifice your creative voice and make whatever a platform rewards,

135
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,320
it's more than possible to min-max your way into success with extremely watchable garbage.

136
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,920
That much became clear in the 2010s, when small production studios realized that kids

137
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,720
under 5 watch basically anything you put in front of them, as long as it has eye-catching

138
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,600
visuals and familiar songs or characters.

139
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,840
So they started pumping out thousands and thousands of nonsense videos made of reused

140
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,040
assets Frankenstein together in every possible configuration.

141
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,240
Kids that young aren't really capable of choosing one video over another.

142
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
So the videos didn't need to be good.

143
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,960
They just had to hold their attention.

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,080
The scope of this problem was limited because the strategy only worked on babies.

145
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,800
But on TikTok, we're all babies.

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
On TikTok, we don't choose what to watch.

147
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,240
Instead, we watch what's presented to us by the For You page and judge it mainly on

148
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,040
whether it holds our attention.

149
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,560
It's a drastically different experience.

150
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,520
And as anyone who's been hypnotized by sledge videos will tell you, content that holds

151
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,760
your interest when presented to you isn't necessarily content you consider worth watching.

152
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,400
In fact, sometimes they're opposites.

153
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,920
TikTok is overrun with videos that take ages, fucking ages to get to the point.

154
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,680
Videos that are all build-up, no payoff.

155
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,520
Theandering storytimes that give three minutes of backstory no one asked for and then never

156
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,240
actually deliver the goods.

157
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Until you get to the end, you can't know if a video will be worth it.

158
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,840
And once you do, your opinion no longer matters.

159
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,280
The video has extracted what it needs from you.

160
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,240
This isn't always malicious.

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,160
Often the TikTok algorithm amplifies regular people who are trying to tell their friends

162
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,440
a story and just did a kind of bad job.

163
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,840
A theoretical better-telling of that story that got to the point right away wouldn't

164
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,680
perform as well, so you probably wouldn't have seen it.

165
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,200
Videos like that suggest that there's a gulf between what kind of content is optimal and

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,080
what kind of content is good.

167
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,560
I think TikTok's sledge represents that gulf at its absolute widest possible, because

168
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,320
it's fantastically optimized to hold your attention, but it doesn't care at all what

169
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
you think about it.

170
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,400
A sledge video is worse than the song it plays, it's worse than Subway Surfer, it's definitely

171
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,520
worse than whatever movie it's rebooting, but it's better than any of those three at

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,120
keeping you around, because if ever you lose interest in one, there's so much to fall

173
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
back on.

174
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,600
Content sledge ignores human taste and appeals to less conscious processes, like our absolutely

175
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
dismal attention spans, which have been running the show the whole time.

176
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,040
Personally, mine's pretty shot from years of always doing two things at once, cooking

177
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,960
while watching a TV show, playing a game while listening to a podcast, whatever.

178
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,080
I suspect it's also partially a trauma thing for me, like even 10 minutes of total silence

179
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,720
will send me into a tailspin.

180
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,880
It's not something I'm proud of, I think it's one of my bigger weaknesses.

181
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,080
And sledge is the rare media that just indulges that.

182
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,880
It demands basically nothing of me, and offers basically nothing in return.

183
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,720
So it's easy to fall down a rabbit hole and watch 10 episodes of young Sheldon or whatever

184
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
without even noticing.

185
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,760
The thing to understand is that TikTok doesn't reward videos made for human beings, it rewards

186
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,120
videos made for human attention spans.

187
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,240
And the more video targets our attention spans, the less priority it can give to other facets

188
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,000
of the human experience, like intelligence or emotions or physical comfort.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,820
Everyone can tell something's wrong with these videos.

190
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,360
All the pieces are familiar, but the way they're arranged doesn't conform to any human perspective.

191
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,440
This is what some people do assume that sledge videos are made by AI, and I don't think they

192
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
are.

193
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
That would add a lot of complexity.

194
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,280
AI would have to download the clips, choose where to cut the scenes, understand which

195
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,480
videos to play next to each other, notice which components do well, and adapt future

196
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,040
videos to match.

197
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,000
Meanwhile, a human could easily crank out 40 of these videos in a day, and most they

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
might use some coding to swap out clips, but that's not AI.

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
I can't blame people for assuming though.

200
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,760
These videos feel like the AI art we were seeing a couple years ago.

201
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,280
It's like what algorithms would imagine humans want to see, and in a roundabout way it is.

202
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,560
While sledge videos are probably made with human input, they might as well not be, because

203
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,200
they're produced to the exact whims of recommendation algorithms.

204
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,000
A content firm spits out a handful of videos, some do well and others flop, so the humans

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,480
try to figure out why.

206
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,160
Maybe this game was good for retention, maybe this show doesn't really hold the audience,

207
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,960
they learn what works, then they make videos that are incrementally more optimized for

208
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,720
the platform.

209
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,840
An operation on this industrial scale has no reason to consider taste, and really no

210
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,280
way to measure it.

211
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,640
Views are the only metric that counts for anything.

212
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,920
The humans making sledge videos are effectively tools, acting out the wishes of an unknowable

213
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
machine.

214
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
No offense.

215
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,240
The resulting genre joins a growing movement of post-human art, where human involvement

216
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,040
is incidental and transient.

217
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,000
We're just around to do whatever grunt work can't be pwned off onto AI yet.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
You've seen this stuff before.

219
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,280
Elsa Gate was an early warning with its stiff animation and nonsense storylines, YouTube

220
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:10,360
thumbnails with enlarged eyes and faces, grotesque but oh so clickable, articles written entirely

221
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,800
by the rules of search engine optimization, running thousands of words and barely answering

222
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,120
your questions.

223
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,280
While humans produce content sledge, the artist is the algorithm, and while humans consume

224
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,440
content sledge, the audience is also the algorithm.

225
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,160
Content sledge is AI-generated art that just happens to be made by humans.

226
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,800
And people aren't stupid, they can tell they're being exploited, even if they don't know

227
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,640
exactly how.

228
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,480
Part of what makes content sledge so off-putting is that most art-considers will experience

229
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,160
it from the perspective of our human bodies.

230
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,000
Like Mad Max Fury Road famously puts everything important in the middle of the frame, so your

231
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,760
eyes can follow the action through a million rapid cuts.

232
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,080
Content sledge, my eyes dart around helplessly, am I meant to watch all three things happening

233
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,720
on screen, or just one, or any of them even, or like Chantel Ackerman's movies are really

234
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,960
slow, famously slow, but it works so well.

235
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,240
It gives you time to interpret each shot in several ways and kinda get lost in your thoughts.

236
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,800
And then when she cuts to a new scene it snaps you out of your days, and it ends up being

237
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,960
surprisingly thrilling.

238
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,560
My friend Sasha, who helped out on this video, describes Ackerman's movies as a collaborative

239
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,440
effort between the filmmaker and the viewer.

240
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,480
When I watch content sledge, it's like I don't exist.

241
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,040
If I'm thinking or feeling anything, I couldn't tell you what it is.

242
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,400
The amount of sensory noise coming my way crowds out any deeper awareness.

243
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,440
At most, I can maybe describe the plot of the movie, but I can't tell you anything

244
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,240
about the performances or the themes.

245
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,560
The thing only takes up half my little screen.

246
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,600
The actors' faces are as big as like a kind of small grape.

247
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,400
So I watch all the way through, but it's a one-way experience that barely feels like

248
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
an experience at all.

249
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,960
My heart speeds up, my pupils dilate, but who cares?

250
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,800
The room might as well be empty.

251
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,320
Back before, optimism felt like a cruel joke.

252
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,760
We used to say that the internet was democratizing culture.

253
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,160
The explosion of YouTube, blogging, and photo sharing created new genres and forms that

254
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,240
were basically free to produce in and had no pre-existing rules.

255
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,880
All of a sudden, teenagers were getting famous from their bedroom.

256
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,320
Regular people were getting six-figure book deals.

257
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,120
The narrative was that the internet took power away from the gatekeepers, their radio stations

258
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,080
and film studios, and returned it to the people.

259
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
And that's fair.

260
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,800
Culture does feel pretty participatory now, and it's easier than ever to get your art

261
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,280
in front of people.

262
00:16:52,280 --> 00:17:00,160
But no democracy would create art that's so anti-social, so hostile to human experience.

263
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,760
If the public voted on what kind of media was rewarded, journalists would still have jobs.

264
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,120
Musicians could make a living.

265
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,680
And tech talk honestly might not exist at all.

266
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,320
It's true that these days, regular people create a lot of the most popular art.

267
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,040
But what we create, the actual content of it, is molded by a very small number of companies

268
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,480
whose interests often go against our own.

269
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,320
Tech Talk alone decides who they'll end up platform.

270
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,320
We should think about what kind of messages that fosters.

271
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,800
To me, it seems like Tech Talk's goal is to convince you it's the beating heart of

272
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,360
modern culture, where everything interesting happens.

273
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,200
Beyond the literal content of a video, it's the variety you get while scrolling.

274
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,160
It's the sheer number of niches, telling the viewer they can have a little bit of everything

275
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,680
all the time.

276
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,200
And Tech Talk is where they'll find it.

277
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,360
I think content sludge is a perfect, like objectively perfect, carrier of that message.

278
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,320
It presents us with two or three drastically different videos at once.

279
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,640
A level of variety no other media can touch.

280
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,680
It offers us a chance at pure consumption.

281
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,320
Or what's being watched is secondary to the ritual of staring at a screen.

282
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,880
Each component substance is kept to a minimum, offering as little as possible to grapple

283
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
with.

284
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,080
To draw all our attention to the fact that we don't have to choose between the satisfaction

285
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,600
of a slime, the excitement of a mobile game, and the intrigue of a drama.

286
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,840
That as long as we stay right here, we can have it all.

287
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,280
And I guess what I'm trying to say with this video is fuck that.

288
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
We can't have it all.

289
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
We don't need it all.

290
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,400
The health of a media diet is not measured in total amount consumed.

291
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,440
We've been trained to accept whatever stale popcorn the algorithms toss our way.

292
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,960
Like, we can't tell the difference between filler and nourishment.

293
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,400
But some part of us does know, even as we're asked to forget our bodies.

294
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,160
Some part of us knows and hungers.

295
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,480
The larger problem here is not one you or I can solve.

296
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
We don't run TikTok.

297
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,480
We won't convince them to make their algorithm less effective.

298
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,080
And I'm not big on individualist solutions for this kind of problem that's just capitalism

299
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
doing its thing.

300
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,760
But if content sludge isn't going anywhere, I think we need to at least learn to make

301
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,400
ourselves less miserable.

302
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,080
Personally, my life became a lot more enjoyable when I started being intentional about my

303
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
media diet.

304
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,080
So no watching whatever an algorithm sticks in my face, no following trends for the sake

305
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
of it.

306
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,160
Instead, I've been paying attention to what speaks to me and actively seeking it out,

307
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,280
even when it's challenging or boring.

308
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,880
And it is boring sometimes, at least according to my busted attention span.

309
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm realizing books are like really long.

310
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,040
For the past six months or so, I've been going to some local film screenings at museums

311
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,520
or small festivals.

312
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,120
I've seen like dozens of good movies, most of which you can only watch in person.

313
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,320
And I do live in a good city for that stuff.

314
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,120
But basically, no matter where you live, there are probably movie nerds putting on screenings.

315
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,120
There are probably art galleries you can walk into and find something totally moving.

316
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,240
There are probably local bands who'd love it if you went to their shows.

317
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,960
They're not usually very good, but that's not the point of a local scene.

318
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
It turns out most music is kind of bad.

319
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,040
If these things aren't feasible for you, don't worry about it.

320
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,680
Platforms like Rate Your Music and Letterbox are also great for getting under your bubble.

321
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,840
A lot of libraries have digital rentals now.

322
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,080
And hey, now that I think of it, there's always Nebula nailed it.

323
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,320
Since last year, I've been developing a movie podcast with my friends and fellow creators,

324
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Lola Sebastian and Lady Emily.

325
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,600
When the show starts coming out, which is soon, not sure exactly when, but it's soon,

326
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,200
Nebula will get episodes a full two weeks early, plus some fun bonus episodes that won't be on streaming.

327
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Honestly, if it weren't for Nebula's support, we never could have taken the time to make this weird, risky new thing.

328
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,560
But it's been so much fun just like hanging out with my friends, talking about movies.

329
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,360
We've put quite a lot of work into it, and I'm so glad it's coming together.

330
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,080
Nebula is a curated streaming service owned by its creators, including me.

331
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,080
It gives us a little more freedom to do our own thing and trust that people will find it if it speaks to them.

332
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,400
On Nebula, you'll find some of your favorite creators' catalogs free of ads or sponsorships,

333
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
which makes for a remarkably chill experience.

334
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
The interface is nice and clean, lots of choose from, but it never feels overwhelming.

335
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,600
One thing I really like is that we don't have a recommendation algorithm.

336
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,760
Everything you see on the homepage is handpicked by the Nebula team, and often there's a fun theme to it.

337
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,440
Like, right now we're highlighting our videos about women's history and the future of the human species.

338
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
If you sign up with the link right back there, you can get a discount from yours truly.

339
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,120
You can save 40% on an annual membership,

340
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,400
meaning you only pay like $2.50 a month to support me and over a hundred brilliant creators.

341
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Head over to go.nebula.tv slash Lilly Alexander.

342
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,600
And now, as a thank you for sticking around to the end,

343
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:10,200
let me roll the credits up there and serenade you with the dulcet tones of this melodica I'm kind of okay at.

344
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,120
...

345
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,120
...

346
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,120
...

347
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,120
...

348
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,120
...

349
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,120
...

350
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,120
...

351
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,120
...

352
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,120
...

353
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,120
...

354
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,120
...

355
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,120
...

356
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,120
...

357
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
If you tell anyone I'm blocking you.
