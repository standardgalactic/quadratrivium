 Lilly Alexander discusses the importance of curating a meaningful media diet in an age dominated by algorithms that often prioritize engagement over quality. She suggests that instead of relying on platforms like TikTok to provide content, individuals should seek out experiences that resonate with them and actively choose what they consume. Alexander shares her personal journey of finding fulfillment through engaging with local film screenings, art galleries, live music, and by participating in a movie podcast called "Nebula Nailed It" with friends Lola Sebastian and Lady Emily.

Nebula is a curated streaming service that offers a collection of content chosen by its creators without the intrusion of ads or algorithmic recommendations. The service prides itself on providing a thoughtful, less overwhelming experience. Alexander encourages viewers to join Nebula using her referral link for a 40% discount on an annual membership, which supports not only her but also over a hundred other creators.

To conclude, Alexander thanks her audience for their time and shares a light-hearted moment by playing the melodica, inviting viewers to enjoy this personal touch before potentially parting ways. She also teases that if anyone records or shares this moment without her permission, they will be blocked.
