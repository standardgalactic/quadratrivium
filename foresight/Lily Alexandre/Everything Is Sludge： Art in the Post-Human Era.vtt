00:00.000 --> 00:13.560
In 2016 and 2017, journalists noticed that YouTube was serving kids videos of famous

00:13.560 --> 00:16.960
characters in baffling situations.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.360
Usually these videos were cheap animations, but sometimes they started real people, just

00:21.360 --> 00:27.060
as Elsa or Spider-Man or whoever, acting out storylines that were always incoherent and

00:27.060 --> 00:28.940
sometimes disturbing.

00:28.940 --> 00:33.980
The characters would get pregnant, get in car crashes, commit crimes, in some cases be

00:33.980 --> 00:35.500
buried alive.

00:35.500 --> 00:40.100
The scandal became known as Elsa Gate, and it was possible in part because kids are a

00:40.100 --> 00:42.300
pretty passive audience.

00:42.300 --> 00:48.020
A video could be a procedurally generated mishmash of characters and songs and bright colors,

00:48.020 --> 00:50.240
and they would still watch all the way through.

00:50.240 --> 00:54.900
My introduction to Elsa Gate was a great article called Something Is Wrong on the Internet

00:55.020 --> 00:59.780
by a writer named James Bridal, which pointed out that even beyond Elsa Gate, the entire

00:59.780 --> 01:02.940
culture of children's YouTube was troubling.

01:02.940 --> 01:06.700
Some of the most popular videos around were product unboxings.

01:06.700 --> 01:11.620
Kids would watch adults open up kinder eggs or play with toys to the tune of hundreds

01:11.620 --> 01:13.940
of millions of views.

01:13.940 --> 01:19.020
In an article for New York Magazine, one mom described how toy videos affected her two-year-old,

01:19.020 --> 01:20.020
saying,

01:20.020 --> 01:29.940
Plus, there's something about seeing your kids sitting still and watching a video of

01:29.940 --> 01:34.420
somebody playing with toys instead of actually playing with toys themselves that makes you

01:34.420 --> 01:37.940
feel like the victim of some awful irony of modern life.

01:37.940 --> 01:42.100
The flood of stories was awful PR for YouTube kids, which had just launched a couple years

01:42.100 --> 01:46.180
earlier and was still trying to win over parents in new markets.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.900
So weirdly not my market.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.560
YouTube Kids isn't available in Quebec.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.060
Never has been.

01:51.060 --> 01:54.420
Almost everywhere in North America, just not here specifically.

01:54.420 --> 01:58.980
Francophobia aside, I think YouTubers responded to this scandal pretty well.

01:58.980 --> 02:03.300
They removed thousands of the offending videos, maybe hundreds of thousands, and gave parents

02:03.300 --> 02:07.500
the option to only show channels that had been manually approved by YouTube staff.

02:07.500 --> 02:12.540
Although I can't verify this because YouTuber Cowards who fear the Kibbutz people, my impression

02:12.540 --> 02:16.100
is that online video isn't a much better place these days.

02:16.100 --> 02:31.860
I'm glad to say we've left this in- I'm glad to say-

02:31.860 --> 02:36.540
If you spend a lot of time on TikTok or anywhere that likes complaining about TikTok, you've

02:36.540 --> 02:38.420
probably seen a video like this one.

02:38.420 --> 02:43.620
At the most basic, these videos comprise a clip from a show or movie played next to some

02:43.620 --> 02:48.420
unrelated, visually stimulating footage, sometimes a person playing with slime or cutting

02:48.420 --> 02:54.780
into soap, but most iconically, screen recordings of the mobile game's subway surfers.

02:54.780 --> 02:59.260
This genre of video is often called sludge content, for the way it combines different

02:59.260 --> 03:05.380
pieces of media into a pre-digested slurry, where no one component can really be considered

03:05.380 --> 03:06.820
on its own merit.

03:06.820 --> 03:12.180
Other most chaotic sludge videos feature three videos playing side by side, plus a caption

03:12.180 --> 03:18.140
describing the main video, plus subtitles in English and Chinese, plus grating royalty-free

03:18.140 --> 03:24.980
music playing over top, potent enough to tranquilize a cow or kill a German philosopher.

03:24.980 --> 03:29.700
Over the past few months, these videos have gained a reputation as being one, creatively

03:29.700 --> 03:37.620
bankrupt, two, incredibly overwhelming, and three, almost impossible to look away from.

03:37.620 --> 03:42.900
Sludge videos flood people's feeds and rock up millions of views because as widely disdained

03:42.900 --> 03:46.660
as they are, they're also incredibly easy to watch.

03:46.660 --> 03:50.380
They put viewers in a similar headspace as the Elsa Gate stuff.

03:50.380 --> 03:54.020
I almost want to say hypnotized, like watching them isn't our choice.

03:54.020 --> 03:59.540
A couple weeks ago, I made a sludge video as a joke for my Patreon, and even though I knew

03:59.540 --> 04:04.660
exactly what it was going to say, I still watched it like four or five times all the

04:04.660 --> 04:05.660
way through.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.220
It's hard to put the experience into words.

04:08.220 --> 04:13.620
When I watch sludge videos, I'm not enjoying myself, I'm not getting anything out of it,

04:13.620 --> 04:15.340
but it would be tough to say I'm not engaged.

04:15.340 --> 04:20.660
I mean, I'm watching the whole way through with my eyes glued to the screen, despite

04:20.660 --> 04:24.340
none of the interest that would usually keep me around.

04:24.340 --> 04:29.380
It's like something about these videos bypasses the thinking part of my brain and connects

04:29.380 --> 04:31.700
straight to the reward center.

04:31.740 --> 04:37.380
If you think such busy videos would be pure sensory noise, like totally impossible for

04:37.380 --> 04:44.100
any human being to parse, but they do a couple things to stay at least kind of legible.

04:44.100 --> 04:48.540
First off, each type of clip that gets used is familiar to anyone who's been on TikTok

04:48.540 --> 04:52.540
or it's competitors, and each one follows a reliable formula.

04:52.540 --> 04:55.900
When you start watching, you know the soap is going to be sliced or the subway is going

04:55.900 --> 04:59.860
to be surfed, so the little side clips don't require your full attention.

04:59.860 --> 05:04.020
A lot of the time, you even know what's going to happen in the show or movie because a text

05:04.020 --> 05:06.140
overlay spoils it for you.

05:06.140 --> 05:10.420
Having that context means that every video kind of feels the same, but it also makes

05:10.420 --> 05:12.580
them easier to digest.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.220
Of course, more clips also means more stimulation and more payoffs, which is probably the real

05:17.220 --> 05:22.140
reason for this format, even though you know what to expect there's a lot to anticipate.

05:22.140 --> 05:26.820
Those oddly satisfying type videos offer quick and easy payoffs while you wait for the main

05:26.820 --> 05:28.340
clip to resolve.

05:28.340 --> 05:32.060
They keep you watching even if the main clip isn't especially interesting.

05:32.060 --> 05:37.220
On the other hand, a lot of the game footage that gets played never really pays off.

05:37.220 --> 05:41.500
They tend to be from endless runners that you can actually win, like subway surfers, or

05:41.500 --> 05:45.260
those Minecraft stages that are just a series of tricky jumps.

05:45.260 --> 05:50.340
They offer a baseline of visual interest, but since they never actually finish, since

05:50.340 --> 05:53.700
they never resolve, I'm always left unsatisfied.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.900
Question content sludge is joylessly waiting around for nothing in particular.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.660
I guess the big question there is why, right?

06:01.660 --> 06:03.700
How did such a weird genre take form?

06:03.700 --> 06:05.620
How did it get popular?

06:05.620 --> 06:08.180
Obviously, the answer is money, right?

06:08.180 --> 06:11.060
No one would make this stuff unless they were making money, but even knowing that it's

06:11.060 --> 06:16.660
still kind of baffling, it's like finding out that 5% of your country's GDP comes from

06:16.660 --> 06:18.980
professional jugglers.

06:18.980 --> 06:22.400
How does this, of all things, generate revenue?

06:22.400 --> 06:27.080
This game works by exploiting a couple quirks of the TikTok platform.

06:27.080 --> 06:33.280
First off, with the possible exception of music, TikTok is shockingly lax on copyright.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.120
As far as we know, they don't have any systems in place to screen videos for reposting shows

06:38.120 --> 06:39.120
or movies.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.560
This attitude sets them apart from their biggest competitors, Shorts on YouTube, Reels on Instagram

06:43.560 --> 06:46.960
and Facebook, all of which are actively monitored for copyright.

06:46.960 --> 06:52.360
On TikTok, stolen videos run rampant because they can only be taken down by manual reports.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.680
And I'm told even those are kind of a joke.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.120
Like Philip from the channel Volksgeist was telling me about a guy who's racked up 70,000

07:00.120 --> 07:05.680
followers on TikTok by reposting his videos with these stomach-churning, zoom-arc-war-fast

07:05.680 --> 07:06.680
edits.

07:06.680 --> 07:11.520
At some points, this account has actively pretended to be the guy in the videos.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.840
It seems to me like a pretty open and shut case, but Philip reported them to TikTok and

07:15.840 --> 07:17.880
never heard anything back.

07:17.880 --> 07:23.480
So it's feasible to pirate an entire TV show or movie or YouTube channel or whatever and

07:23.480 --> 07:25.760
rerun it on TikTok for easy money.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.800
On the off chance, you do get caught and your account gets banned.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
Who cares?

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
Just start another one.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.640
Second, TikTok is exceptionally good at keeping viewers around.

07:35.640 --> 07:39.000
The algorithm's main goal is to maximize viewer retention.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.480
So it pushes videos that people watch to the end and then stay on the app when they're

07:42.480 --> 07:43.480
finished.

07:43.480 --> 07:47.400
Better retention equals more visibility, equals more views, equals more money.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.800
Retention is a really common metric to measure video quality.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.200
YouTube's waited in some capacity for over a decade now.

07:54.200 --> 07:58.000
And if all the options available, I think it's a pretty good one.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.760
Consider the options here.

07:59.760 --> 08:04.680
If videos got pushed based on the ratio of likes to dislikes, then bragging could easily

08:04.680 --> 08:06.760
tank people's careers.

08:06.760 --> 08:11.720
If went by comments, then inflammatory videos might be pushed over more thoughtful stuff.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.480
In YouTube's case, retention means videos are rewarded for following through on their

08:15.480 --> 08:16.480
promise.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.680
Watching a video to the end implies you got what you came for.

08:19.680 --> 08:25.040
It's also the reason some videos are like seven hours long these days, which honestly

08:25.040 --> 08:26.400
not everyone can pull off.

08:26.400 --> 08:31.280
I come on here with like one big take every two months and that feels like a bit much

08:31.280 --> 08:32.400
sometimes.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.720
Any recommendation system will change what kind of content is rewarded, and therefore

08:36.720 --> 08:38.920
what kind of content gets made.

08:38.920 --> 08:40.840
I don't want to go all first year film student.

08:40.840 --> 08:46.280
The medium is the message on you here, but I only did one year film school.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.840
So I'm going to do it anyway.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.840
If you're willing to sacrifice your creative voice and make whatever a platform rewards,

08:52.840 --> 08:58.320
it's more than possible to min-max your way into success with extremely watchable garbage.

08:58.320 --> 09:02.920
That much became clear in the 2010s, when small production studios realized that kids

09:02.920 --> 09:07.720
under 5 watch basically anything you put in front of them, as long as it has eye-catching

09:07.720 --> 09:10.600
visuals and familiar songs or characters.

09:10.600 --> 09:15.840
So they started pumping out thousands and thousands of nonsense videos made of reused

09:15.840 --> 09:20.040
assets Frankenstein together in every possible configuration.

09:20.040 --> 09:24.240
Kids that young aren't really capable of choosing one video over another.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.240
So the videos didn't need to be good.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.960
They just had to hold their attention.

09:27.960 --> 09:33.080
The scope of this problem was limited because the strategy only worked on babies.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.800
But on TikTok, we're all babies.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.800
On TikTok, we don't choose what to watch.

09:39.880 --> 09:44.240
Instead, we watch what's presented to us by the For You page and judge it mainly on

09:44.240 --> 09:46.040
whether it holds our attention.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.560
It's a drastically different experience.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.520
And as anyone who's been hypnotized by sledge videos will tell you, content that holds

09:52.520 --> 09:58.760
your interest when presented to you isn't necessarily content you consider worth watching.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.400
In fact, sometimes they're opposites.

10:01.400 --> 10:06.920
TikTok is overrun with videos that take ages, fucking ages to get to the point.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.680
Videos that are all build-up, no payoff.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.520
Theandering storytimes that give three minutes of backstory no one asked for and then never

10:13.520 --> 10:15.240
actually deliver the goods.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.400
Until you get to the end, you can't know if a video will be worth it.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.840
And once you do, your opinion no longer matters.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.280
The video has extracted what it needs from you.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.240
This isn't always malicious.

10:27.240 --> 10:31.160
Often the TikTok algorithm amplifies regular people who are trying to tell their friends

10:31.160 --> 10:34.440
a story and just did a kind of bad job.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.840
A theoretical better-telling of that story that got to the point right away wouldn't

10:38.840 --> 10:42.680
perform as well, so you probably wouldn't have seen it.

10:42.680 --> 10:47.200
Videos like that suggest that there's a gulf between what kind of content is optimal and

10:47.200 --> 10:49.080
what kind of content is good.

10:49.080 --> 10:54.560
I think TikTok's sledge represents that gulf at its absolute widest possible, because

10:54.560 --> 10:58.320
it's fantastically optimized to hold your attention, but it doesn't care at all what

10:58.320 --> 10:59.320
you think about it.

10:59.320 --> 11:04.400
A sledge video is worse than the song it plays, it's worse than Subway Surfer, it's definitely

11:04.400 --> 11:08.520
worse than whatever movie it's rebooting, but it's better than any of those three at

11:08.520 --> 11:13.120
keeping you around, because if ever you lose interest in one, there's so much to fall

11:13.120 --> 11:14.240
back on.

11:14.240 --> 11:19.600
Content sledge ignores human taste and appeals to less conscious processes, like our absolutely

11:19.600 --> 11:23.440
dismal attention spans, which have been running the show the whole time.

11:23.440 --> 11:28.040
Personally, mine's pretty shot from years of always doing two things at once, cooking

11:28.040 --> 11:31.960
while watching a TV show, playing a game while listening to a podcast, whatever.

11:31.960 --> 11:37.080
I suspect it's also partially a trauma thing for me, like even 10 minutes of total silence

11:37.120 --> 11:38.720
will send me into a tailspin.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.880
It's not something I'm proud of, I think it's one of my bigger weaknesses.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.080
And sledge is the rare media that just indulges that.

11:46.080 --> 11:51.880
It demands basically nothing of me, and offers basically nothing in return.

11:51.880 --> 11:56.720
So it's easy to fall down a rabbit hole and watch 10 episodes of young Sheldon or whatever

11:56.720 --> 11:58.120
without even noticing.

11:58.120 --> 12:03.760
The thing to understand is that TikTok doesn't reward videos made for human beings, it rewards

12:03.760 --> 12:07.120
videos made for human attention spans.

12:07.120 --> 12:11.240
And the more video targets our attention spans, the less priority it can give to other facets

12:11.240 --> 12:17.000
of the human experience, like intelligence or emotions or physical comfort.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.820
Everyone can tell something's wrong with these videos.

12:19.820 --> 12:25.360
All the pieces are familiar, but the way they're arranged doesn't conform to any human perspective.

12:25.360 --> 12:30.440
This is what some people do assume that sledge videos are made by AI, and I don't think they

12:30.440 --> 12:31.440
are.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.440
That would add a lot of complexity.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.280
AI would have to download the clips, choose where to cut the scenes, understand which

12:36.280 --> 12:40.480
videos to play next to each other, notice which components do well, and adapt future

12:40.480 --> 12:42.040
videos to match.

12:42.040 --> 12:47.000
Meanwhile, a human could easily crank out 40 of these videos in a day, and most they

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
might use some coding to swap out clips, but that's not AI.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.240
I can't blame people for assuming though.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.760
These videos feel like the AI art we were seeing a couple years ago.

12:55.760 --> 13:02.280
It's like what algorithms would imagine humans want to see, and in a roundabout way it is.

13:02.760 --> 13:07.560
While sledge videos are probably made with human input, they might as well not be, because

13:07.560 --> 13:11.200
they're produced to the exact whims of recommendation algorithms.

13:11.200 --> 13:16.000
A content firm spits out a handful of videos, some do well and others flop, so the humans

13:16.000 --> 13:17.480
try to figure out why.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.160
Maybe this game was good for retention, maybe this show doesn't really hold the audience,

13:21.160 --> 13:24.960
they learn what works, then they make videos that are incrementally more optimized for

13:24.960 --> 13:26.720
the platform.

13:26.720 --> 13:31.840
An operation on this industrial scale has no reason to consider taste, and really no

13:31.880 --> 13:33.280
way to measure it.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.640
Views are the only metric that counts for anything.

13:35.640 --> 13:40.920
The humans making sledge videos are effectively tools, acting out the wishes of an unknowable

13:40.920 --> 13:42.920
machine.

13:42.920 --> 13:43.920
No offense.

13:43.920 --> 13:49.240
The resulting genre joins a growing movement of post-human art, where human involvement

13:49.240 --> 13:52.040
is incidental and transient.

13:52.040 --> 13:56.000
We're just around to do whatever grunt work can't be pwned off onto AI yet.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.680
You've seen this stuff before.

13:57.680 --> 14:03.280
Elsa Gate was an early warning with its stiff animation and nonsense storylines, YouTube

14:03.280 --> 14:10.360
thumbnails with enlarged eyes and faces, grotesque but oh so clickable, articles written entirely

14:10.360 --> 14:15.800
by the rules of search engine optimization, running thousands of words and barely answering

14:15.800 --> 14:17.120
your questions.

14:17.120 --> 14:23.280
While humans produce content sledge, the artist is the algorithm, and while humans consume

14:23.320 --> 14:28.440
content sledge, the audience is also the algorithm.

14:28.440 --> 14:33.160
Content sledge is AI-generated art that just happens to be made by humans.

14:33.160 --> 14:36.800
And people aren't stupid, they can tell they're being exploited, even if they don't know

14:36.800 --> 14:38.640
exactly how.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.480
Part of what makes content sledge so off-putting is that most art-considers will experience

14:42.480 --> 14:45.160
it from the perspective of our human bodies.

14:45.160 --> 14:50.000
Like Mad Max Fury Road famously puts everything important in the middle of the frame, so your

14:50.000 --> 14:52.760
eyes can follow the action through a million rapid cuts.

14:52.760 --> 14:58.080
Content sledge, my eyes dart around helplessly, am I meant to watch all three things happening

14:58.080 --> 15:05.720
on screen, or just one, or any of them even, or like Chantel Ackerman's movies are really

15:05.720 --> 15:09.960
slow, famously slow, but it works so well.

15:09.960 --> 15:15.240
It gives you time to interpret each shot in several ways and kinda get lost in your thoughts.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.800
And then when she cuts to a new scene it snaps you out of your days, and it ends up being

15:18.800 --> 15:20.960
surprisingly thrilling.

15:20.960 --> 15:25.560
My friend Sasha, who helped out on this video, describes Ackerman's movies as a collaborative

15:25.560 --> 15:28.440
effort between the filmmaker and the viewer.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.480
When I watch content sledge, it's like I don't exist.

15:32.480 --> 15:36.040
If I'm thinking or feeling anything, I couldn't tell you what it is.

15:36.040 --> 15:40.400
The amount of sensory noise coming my way crowds out any deeper awareness.

15:40.400 --> 15:45.440
At most, I can maybe describe the plot of the movie, but I can't tell you anything

15:45.440 --> 15:48.240
about the performances or the themes.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.560
The thing only takes up half my little screen.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.600
The actors' faces are as big as like a kind of small grape.

15:54.600 --> 15:59.400
So I watch all the way through, but it's a one-way experience that barely feels like

15:59.400 --> 16:01.400
an experience at all.

16:01.400 --> 16:05.960
My heart speeds up, my pupils dilate, but who cares?

16:05.960 --> 16:10.800
The room might as well be empty.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.320
Back before, optimism felt like a cruel joke.

16:14.320 --> 16:17.760
We used to say that the internet was democratizing culture.

16:17.760 --> 16:23.160
The explosion of YouTube, blogging, and photo sharing created new genres and forms that

16:23.160 --> 16:28.240
were basically free to produce in and had no pre-existing rules.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.880
All of a sudden, teenagers were getting famous from their bedroom.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.320
Regular people were getting six-figure book deals.

16:34.320 --> 16:39.120
The narrative was that the internet took power away from the gatekeepers, their radio stations

16:39.120 --> 16:43.080
and film studios, and returned it to the people.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.080
And that's fair.

16:44.080 --> 16:48.800
Culture does feel pretty participatory now, and it's easier than ever to get your art

16:48.800 --> 16:52.280
in front of people.

16:52.280 --> 17:00.160
But no democracy would create art that's so anti-social, so hostile to human experience.

17:00.160 --> 17:05.760
If the public voted on what kind of media was rewarded, journalists would still have jobs.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.120
Musicians could make a living.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.680
And tech talk honestly might not exist at all.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.320
It's true that these days, regular people create a lot of the most popular art.

17:15.320 --> 17:21.040
But what we create, the actual content of it, is molded by a very small number of companies

17:21.040 --> 17:23.480
whose interests often go against our own.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.320
Tech Talk alone decides who they'll end up platform.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.320
We should think about what kind of messages that fosters.

17:29.320 --> 17:33.800
To me, it seems like Tech Talk's goal is to convince you it's the beating heart of

17:33.800 --> 17:37.360
modern culture, where everything interesting happens.

17:37.360 --> 17:42.200
Beyond the literal content of a video, it's the variety you get while scrolling.

17:42.200 --> 17:47.160
It's the sheer number of niches, telling the viewer they can have a little bit of everything

17:47.160 --> 17:48.680
all the time.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.200
And Tech Talk is where they'll find it.

17:50.200 --> 17:56.360
I think content sludge is a perfect, like objectively perfect, carrier of that message.

17:56.360 --> 18:00.320
It presents us with two or three drastically different videos at once.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.640
A level of variety no other media can touch.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.680
It offers us a chance at pure consumption.

18:06.680 --> 18:12.320
Or what's being watched is secondary to the ritual of staring at a screen.

18:12.320 --> 18:16.880
Each component substance is kept to a minimum, offering as little as possible to grapple

18:16.880 --> 18:17.880
with.

18:17.880 --> 18:22.080
To draw all our attention to the fact that we don't have to choose between the satisfaction

18:22.080 --> 18:26.600
of a slime, the excitement of a mobile game, and the intrigue of a drama.

18:26.600 --> 18:30.840
That as long as we stay right here, we can have it all.

18:31.160 --> 18:36.280
And I guess what I'm trying to say with this video is fuck that.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.280
We can't have it all.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.160
We don't need it all.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.400
The health of a media diet is not measured in total amount consumed.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.440
We've been trained to accept whatever stale popcorn the algorithms toss our way.

18:47.440 --> 18:51.960
Like, we can't tell the difference between filler and nourishment.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.400
But some part of us does know, even as we're asked to forget our bodies.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.160
Some part of us knows and hungers.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.480
The larger problem here is not one you or I can solve.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.480
We don't run TikTok.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.480
We won't convince them to make their algorithm less effective.

19:06.480 --> 19:12.080
And I'm not big on individualist solutions for this kind of problem that's just capitalism

19:12.080 --> 19:13.840
doing its thing.

19:13.840 --> 19:18.760
But if content sludge isn't going anywhere, I think we need to at least learn to make

19:18.760 --> 19:20.400
ourselves less miserable.

19:20.400 --> 19:25.080
Personally, my life became a lot more enjoyable when I started being intentional about my

19:25.080 --> 19:26.080
media diet.

19:26.080 --> 19:30.080
So no watching whatever an algorithm sticks in my face, no following trends for the sake

19:30.080 --> 19:31.080
of it.

19:31.080 --> 19:35.160
Instead, I've been paying attention to what speaks to me and actively seeking it out,

19:35.160 --> 19:38.280
even when it's challenging or boring.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.880
And it is boring sometimes, at least according to my busted attention span.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.480
I'm realizing books are like really long.

19:44.480 --> 19:49.040
For the past six months or so, I've been going to some local film screenings at museums

19:49.040 --> 19:50.520
or small festivals.

19:50.520 --> 19:55.120
I've seen like dozens of good movies, most of which you can only watch in person.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.320
And I do live in a good city for that stuff.

19:57.320 --> 20:02.120
But basically, no matter where you live, there are probably movie nerds putting on screenings.

20:02.120 --> 20:07.120
There are probably art galleries you can walk into and find something totally moving.

20:07.120 --> 20:10.240
There are probably local bands who'd love it if you went to their shows.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.960
They're not usually very good, but that's not the point of a local scene.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.960
It turns out most music is kind of bad.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.040
If these things aren't feasible for you, don't worry about it.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.680
Platforms like Rate Your Music and Letterbox are also great for getting under your bubble.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.840
A lot of libraries have digital rentals now.

20:27.280 --> 20:33.080
And hey, now that I think of it, there's always Nebula nailed it.

20:33.080 --> 20:37.320
Since last year, I've been developing a movie podcast with my friends and fellow creators,

20:37.320 --> 20:39.320
Lola Sebastian and Lady Emily.

20:39.320 --> 20:43.600
When the show starts coming out, which is soon, not sure exactly when, but it's soon,

20:43.600 --> 20:49.200
Nebula will get episodes a full two weeks early, plus some fun bonus episodes that won't be on streaming.

20:49.200 --> 20:55.440
Honestly, if it weren't for Nebula's support, we never could have taken the time to make this weird, risky new thing.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.560
But it's been so much fun just like hanging out with my friends, talking about movies.

20:59.560 --> 21:03.360
We've put quite a lot of work into it, and I'm so glad it's coming together.

21:03.360 --> 21:08.080
Nebula is a curated streaming service owned by its creators, including me.

21:08.080 --> 21:13.080
It gives us a little more freedom to do our own thing and trust that people will find it if it speaks to them.

21:13.080 --> 21:18.400
On Nebula, you'll find some of your favorite creators' catalogs free of ads or sponsorships,

21:18.400 --> 21:20.960
which makes for a remarkably chill experience.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.720
The interface is nice and clean, lots of choose from, but it never feels overwhelming.

21:24.720 --> 21:28.600
One thing I really like is that we don't have a recommendation algorithm.

21:28.600 --> 21:33.760
Everything you see on the homepage is handpicked by the Nebula team, and often there's a fun theme to it.

21:33.760 --> 21:39.440
Like, right now we're highlighting our videos about women's history and the future of the human species.

21:39.440 --> 21:43.440
If you sign up with the link right back there, you can get a discount from yours truly.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.120
You can save 40% on an annual membership,

21:46.120 --> 21:52.400
meaning you only pay like $2.50 a month to support me and over a hundred brilliant creators.

21:52.400 --> 21:58.800
Head over to go.nebula.tv slash Lilly Alexander.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.600
And now, as a thank you for sticking around to the end,

22:01.600 --> 22:10.200
let me roll the credits up there and serenade you with the dulcet tones of this melodica I'm kind of okay at.

22:16.120 --> 22:21.120
...

22:21.120 --> 22:26.120
...

22:26.120 --> 22:31.120

22:31.120 --> 22:36.120

22:36.120 --> 22:41.120

22:41.120 --> 22:46.120

22:46.120 --> 22:51.120
...

22:51.120 --> 22:56.120
...

22:56.120 --> 23:01.120
...

23:01.120 --> 23:06.120
...

23:06.120 --> 23:11.120
...

23:11.120 --> 23:16.120
...

23:16.120 --> 23:21.120
...

23:21.120 --> 23:23.120
If you tell anyone I'm blocking you.
