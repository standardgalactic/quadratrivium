0	13560	In 2016 and 2017, journalists noticed that YouTube was serving kids videos of famous
13560	16960	characters in baffling situations.
16960	21360	Usually these videos were cheap animations, but sometimes they started real people, just
21360	27060	as Elsa or Spider-Man or whoever, acting out storylines that were always incoherent and
27060	28940	sometimes disturbing.
28940	33980	The characters would get pregnant, get in car crashes, commit crimes, in some cases be
33980	35500	buried alive.
35500	40100	The scandal became known as Elsa Gate, and it was possible in part because kids are a
40100	42300	pretty passive audience.
42300	48020	A video could be a procedurally generated mishmash of characters and songs and bright colors,
48020	50240	and they would still watch all the way through.
50240	54900	My introduction to Elsa Gate was a great article called Something Is Wrong on the Internet
55020	59780	by a writer named James Bridal, which pointed out that even beyond Elsa Gate, the entire
59780	62940	culture of children's YouTube was troubling.
62940	66700	Some of the most popular videos around were product unboxings.
66700	71620	Kids would watch adults open up kinder eggs or play with toys to the tune of hundreds
71620	73940	of millions of views.
73940	79020	In an article for New York Magazine, one mom described how toy videos affected her two-year-old,
79020	80020	saying,
80020	89940	Plus, there's something about seeing your kids sitting still and watching a video of
89940	94420	somebody playing with toys instead of actually playing with toys themselves that makes you
94420	97940	feel like the victim of some awful irony of modern life.
97940	102100	The flood of stories was awful PR for YouTube kids, which had just launched a couple years
102100	106180	earlier and was still trying to win over parents in new markets.
106180	107900	So weirdly not my market.
107900	109560	YouTube Kids isn't available in Quebec.
109560	111060	Never has been.
111060	114420	Almost everywhere in North America, just not here specifically.
114420	118980	Francophobia aside, I think YouTubers responded to this scandal pretty well.
118980	123300	They removed thousands of the offending videos, maybe hundreds of thousands, and gave parents
123300	127500	the option to only show channels that had been manually approved by YouTube staff.
127500	132540	Although I can't verify this because YouTuber Cowards who fear the Kibbutz people, my impression
132540	136100	is that online video isn't a much better place these days.
136100	151860	I'm glad to say we've left this in- I'm glad to say-
151860	156540	If you spend a lot of time on TikTok or anywhere that likes complaining about TikTok, you've
156540	158420	probably seen a video like this one.
158420	163620	At the most basic, these videos comprise a clip from a show or movie played next to some
163620	168420	unrelated, visually stimulating footage, sometimes a person playing with slime or cutting
168420	174780	into soap, but most iconically, screen recordings of the mobile game's subway surfers.
174780	179260	This genre of video is often called sludge content, for the way it combines different
179260	185380	pieces of media into a pre-digested slurry, where no one component can really be considered
185380	186820	on its own merit.
186820	192180	Other most chaotic sludge videos feature three videos playing side by side, plus a caption
192180	198140	describing the main video, plus subtitles in English and Chinese, plus grating royalty-free
198140	204980	music playing over top, potent enough to tranquilize a cow or kill a German philosopher.
204980	209700	Over the past few months, these videos have gained a reputation as being one, creatively
209700	217620	bankrupt, two, incredibly overwhelming, and three, almost impossible to look away from.
217620	222900	Sludge videos flood people's feeds and rock up millions of views because as widely disdained
222900	226660	as they are, they're also incredibly easy to watch.
226660	230380	They put viewers in a similar headspace as the Elsa Gate stuff.
230380	234020	I almost want to say hypnotized, like watching them isn't our choice.
234020	239540	A couple weeks ago, I made a sludge video as a joke for my Patreon, and even though I knew
239540	244660	exactly what it was going to say, I still watched it like four or five times all the
244660	245660	way through.
245700	248220	It's hard to put the experience into words.
248220	253620	When I watch sludge videos, I'm not enjoying myself, I'm not getting anything out of it,
253620	255340	but it would be tough to say I'm not engaged.
255340	260660	I mean, I'm watching the whole way through with my eyes glued to the screen, despite
260660	264340	none of the interest that would usually keep me around.
264340	269380	It's like something about these videos bypasses the thinking part of my brain and connects
269380	271700	straight to the reward center.
271740	277380	If you think such busy videos would be pure sensory noise, like totally impossible for
277380	284100	any human being to parse, but they do a couple things to stay at least kind of legible.
284100	288540	First off, each type of clip that gets used is familiar to anyone who's been on TikTok
288540	292540	or it's competitors, and each one follows a reliable formula.
292540	295900	When you start watching, you know the soap is going to be sliced or the subway is going
295900	299860	to be surfed, so the little side clips don't require your full attention.
299860	304020	A lot of the time, you even know what's going to happen in the show or movie because a text
304020	306140	overlay spoils it for you.
306140	310420	Having that context means that every video kind of feels the same, but it also makes
310420	312580	them easier to digest.
312580	317220	Of course, more clips also means more stimulation and more payoffs, which is probably the real
317220	322140	reason for this format, even though you know what to expect there's a lot to anticipate.
322140	326820	Those oddly satisfying type videos offer quick and easy payoffs while you wait for the main
326820	328340	clip to resolve.
328340	332060	They keep you watching even if the main clip isn't especially interesting.
332060	337220	On the other hand, a lot of the game footage that gets played never really pays off.
337220	341500	They tend to be from endless runners that you can actually win, like subway surfers, or
341500	345260	those Minecraft stages that are just a series of tricky jumps.
345260	350340	They offer a baseline of visual interest, but since they never actually finish, since
350340	353700	they never resolve, I'm always left unsatisfied.
353700	357900	Question content sludge is joylessly waiting around for nothing in particular.
357900	361660	I guess the big question there is why, right?
361660	363700	How did such a weird genre take form?
363700	365620	How did it get popular?
365620	368180	Obviously, the answer is money, right?
368180	371060	No one would make this stuff unless they were making money, but even knowing that it's
371060	376660	still kind of baffling, it's like finding out that 5% of your country's GDP comes from
376660	378980	professional jugglers.
378980	382400	How does this, of all things, generate revenue?
382400	387080	This game works by exploiting a couple quirks of the TikTok platform.
387080	393280	First off, with the possible exception of music, TikTok is shockingly lax on copyright.
393280	398120	As far as we know, they don't have any systems in place to screen videos for reposting shows
398120	399120	or movies.
399120	403560	This attitude sets them apart from their biggest competitors, Shorts on YouTube, Reels on Instagram
403560	406960	and Facebook, all of which are actively monitored for copyright.
406960	412360	On TikTok, stolen videos run rampant because they can only be taken down by manual reports.
413120	415680	And I'm told even those are kind of a joke.
415680	420120	Like Philip from the channel Volksgeist was telling me about a guy who's racked up 70,000
420120	425680	followers on TikTok by reposting his videos with these stomach-churning, zoom-arc-war-fast
425680	426680	edits.
426680	431520	At some points, this account has actively pretended to be the guy in the videos.
431520	435840	It seems to me like a pretty open and shut case, but Philip reported them to TikTok and
435840	437880	never heard anything back.
437880	443480	So it's feasible to pirate an entire TV show or movie or YouTube channel or whatever and
443480	445760	rerun it on TikTok for easy money.
445760	448800	On the off chance, you do get caught and your account gets banned.
448800	449800	Who cares?
449800	450800	Just start another one.
450800	455640	Second, TikTok is exceptionally good at keeping viewers around.
455640	459000	The algorithm's main goal is to maximize viewer retention.
459000	462480	So it pushes videos that people watch to the end and then stay on the app when they're
462480	463480	finished.
463480	467400	Better retention equals more visibility, equals more views, equals more money.
467400	470800	Retention is a really common metric to measure video quality.
470800	474200	YouTube's waited in some capacity for over a decade now.
474200	478000	And if all the options available, I think it's a pretty good one.
478000	479760	Consider the options here.
479760	484680	If videos got pushed based on the ratio of likes to dislikes, then bragging could easily
484680	486760	tank people's careers.
486760	491720	If went by comments, then inflammatory videos might be pushed over more thoughtful stuff.
491720	495480	In YouTube's case, retention means videos are rewarded for following through on their
495480	496480	promise.
496680	499680	Watching a video to the end implies you got what you came for.
499680	505040	It's also the reason some videos are like seven hours long these days, which honestly
505040	506400	not everyone can pull off.
506400	511280	I come on here with like one big take every two months and that feels like a bit much
511280	512400	sometimes.
512400	516720	Any recommendation system will change what kind of content is rewarded, and therefore
516720	518920	what kind of content gets made.
518920	520840	I don't want to go all first year film student.
520840	526280	The medium is the message on you here, but I only did one year film school.
526280	527840	So I'm going to do it anyway.
527840	532840	If you're willing to sacrifice your creative voice and make whatever a platform rewards,
532840	538320	it's more than possible to min-max your way into success with extremely watchable garbage.
538320	542920	That much became clear in the 2010s, when small production studios realized that kids
542920	547720	under 5 watch basically anything you put in front of them, as long as it has eye-catching
547720	550600	visuals and familiar songs or characters.
550600	555840	So they started pumping out thousands and thousands of nonsense videos made of reused
555840	560040	assets Frankenstein together in every possible configuration.
560040	564240	Kids that young aren't really capable of choosing one video over another.
564240	566240	So the videos didn't need to be good.
566240	567960	They just had to hold their attention.
567960	573080	The scope of this problem was limited because the strategy only worked on babies.
573080	576800	But on TikTok, we're all babies.
576800	579800	On TikTok, we don't choose what to watch.
579880	584240	Instead, we watch what's presented to us by the For You page and judge it mainly on
584240	586040	whether it holds our attention.
586040	588560	It's a drastically different experience.
588560	592520	And as anyone who's been hypnotized by sledge videos will tell you, content that holds
592520	598760	your interest when presented to you isn't necessarily content you consider worth watching.
598760	601400	In fact, sometimes they're opposites.
601400	606920	TikTok is overrun with videos that take ages, fucking ages to get to the point.
606920	609680	Videos that are all build-up, no payoff.
609680	613520	Theandering storytimes that give three minutes of backstory no one asked for and then never
613520	615240	actually deliver the goods.
615240	619400	Until you get to the end, you can't know if a video will be worth it.
619400	622840	And once you do, your opinion no longer matters.
622840	625280	The video has extracted what it needs from you.
625280	627240	This isn't always malicious.
627240	631160	Often the TikTok algorithm amplifies regular people who are trying to tell their friends
631160	634440	a story and just did a kind of bad job.
634440	638840	A theoretical better-telling of that story that got to the point right away wouldn't
638840	642680	perform as well, so you probably wouldn't have seen it.
642680	647200	Videos like that suggest that there's a gulf between what kind of content is optimal and
647200	649080	what kind of content is good.
649080	654560	I think TikTok's sledge represents that gulf at its absolute widest possible, because
654560	658320	it's fantastically optimized to hold your attention, but it doesn't care at all what
658320	659320	you think about it.
659320	664400	A sledge video is worse than the song it plays, it's worse than Subway Surfer, it's definitely
664400	668520	worse than whatever movie it's rebooting, but it's better than any of those three at
668520	673120	keeping you around, because if ever you lose interest in one, there's so much to fall
673120	674240	back on.
674240	679600	Content sledge ignores human taste and appeals to less conscious processes, like our absolutely
679600	683440	dismal attention spans, which have been running the show the whole time.
683440	688040	Personally, mine's pretty shot from years of always doing two things at once, cooking
688040	691960	while watching a TV show, playing a game while listening to a podcast, whatever.
691960	697080	I suspect it's also partially a trauma thing for me, like even 10 minutes of total silence
697120	698720	will send me into a tailspin.
698720	702880	It's not something I'm proud of, I think it's one of my bigger weaknesses.
702880	706080	And sledge is the rare media that just indulges that.
706080	711880	It demands basically nothing of me, and offers basically nothing in return.
711880	716720	So it's easy to fall down a rabbit hole and watch 10 episodes of young Sheldon or whatever
716720	718120	without even noticing.
718120	723760	The thing to understand is that TikTok doesn't reward videos made for human beings, it rewards
723760	727120	videos made for human attention spans.
727120	731240	And the more video targets our attention spans, the less priority it can give to other facets
731240	737000	of the human experience, like intelligence or emotions or physical comfort.
737000	739820	Everyone can tell something's wrong with these videos.
739820	745360	All the pieces are familiar, but the way they're arranged doesn't conform to any human perspective.
745360	750440	This is what some people do assume that sledge videos are made by AI, and I don't think they
750440	751440	are.
751440	752440	That would add a lot of complexity.
752800	756280	AI would have to download the clips, choose where to cut the scenes, understand which
756280	760480	videos to play next to each other, notice which components do well, and adapt future
760480	762040	videos to match.
762040	767000	Meanwhile, a human could easily crank out 40 of these videos in a day, and most they
767000	770000	might use some coding to swap out clips, but that's not AI.
770000	772240	I can't blame people for assuming though.
772240	775760	These videos feel like the AI art we were seeing a couple years ago.
775760	782280	It's like what algorithms would imagine humans want to see, and in a roundabout way it is.
782760	787560	While sledge videos are probably made with human input, they might as well not be, because
787560	791200	they're produced to the exact whims of recommendation algorithms.
791200	796000	A content firm spits out a handful of videos, some do well and others flop, so the humans
796000	797480	try to figure out why.
797480	801160	Maybe this game was good for retention, maybe this show doesn't really hold the audience,
801160	804960	they learn what works, then they make videos that are incrementally more optimized for
804960	806720	the platform.
806720	811840	An operation on this industrial scale has no reason to consider taste, and really no
811880	813280	way to measure it.
813280	815640	Views are the only metric that counts for anything.
815640	820920	The humans making sledge videos are effectively tools, acting out the wishes of an unknowable
820920	822920	machine.
822920	823920	No offense.
823920	829240	The resulting genre joins a growing movement of post-human art, where human involvement
829240	832040	is incidental and transient.
832040	836000	We're just around to do whatever grunt work can't be pwned off onto AI yet.
836000	837680	You've seen this stuff before.
837680	843280	Elsa Gate was an early warning with its stiff animation and nonsense storylines, YouTube
843280	850360	thumbnails with enlarged eyes and faces, grotesque but oh so clickable, articles written entirely
850360	855800	by the rules of search engine optimization, running thousands of words and barely answering
855800	857120	your questions.
857120	863280	While humans produce content sledge, the artist is the algorithm, and while humans consume
863320	868440	content sledge, the audience is also the algorithm.
868440	873160	Content sledge is AI-generated art that just happens to be made by humans.
873160	876800	And people aren't stupid, they can tell they're being exploited, even if they don't know
876800	878640	exactly how.
878640	882480	Part of what makes content sledge so off-putting is that most art-considers will experience
882480	885160	it from the perspective of our human bodies.
885160	890000	Like Mad Max Fury Road famously puts everything important in the middle of the frame, so your
890000	892760	eyes can follow the action through a million rapid cuts.
892760	898080	Content sledge, my eyes dart around helplessly, am I meant to watch all three things happening
898080	905720	on screen, or just one, or any of them even, or like Chantel Ackerman's movies are really
905720	909960	slow, famously slow, but it works so well.
909960	915240	It gives you time to interpret each shot in several ways and kinda get lost in your thoughts.
915240	918800	And then when she cuts to a new scene it snaps you out of your days, and it ends up being
918800	920960	surprisingly thrilling.
920960	925560	My friend Sasha, who helped out on this video, describes Ackerman's movies as a collaborative
925560	928440	effort between the filmmaker and the viewer.
928440	932480	When I watch content sledge, it's like I don't exist.
932480	936040	If I'm thinking or feeling anything, I couldn't tell you what it is.
936040	940400	The amount of sensory noise coming my way crowds out any deeper awareness.
940400	945440	At most, I can maybe describe the plot of the movie, but I can't tell you anything
945440	948240	about the performances or the themes.
948240	950560	The thing only takes up half my little screen.
950560	954600	The actors' faces are as big as like a kind of small grape.
954600	959400	So I watch all the way through, but it's a one-way experience that barely feels like
959400	961400	an experience at all.
961400	965960	My heart speeds up, my pupils dilate, but who cares?
965960	970800	The room might as well be empty.
970800	974320	Back before, optimism felt like a cruel joke.
974320	977760	We used to say that the internet was democratizing culture.
977760	983160	The explosion of YouTube, blogging, and photo sharing created new genres and forms that
983160	988240	were basically free to produce in and had no pre-existing rules.
988240	991880	All of a sudden, teenagers were getting famous from their bedroom.
991880	994320	Regular people were getting six-figure book deals.
994320	999120	The narrative was that the internet took power away from the gatekeepers, their radio stations
999120	1003080	and film studios, and returned it to the people.
1003080	1004080	And that's fair.
1004080	1008800	Culture does feel pretty participatory now, and it's easier than ever to get your art
1008800	1012280	in front of people.
1012280	1020160	But no democracy would create art that's so anti-social, so hostile to human experience.
1020160	1025760	If the public voted on what kind of media was rewarded, journalists would still have jobs.
1025760	1027120	Musicians could make a living.
1027120	1030680	And tech talk honestly might not exist at all.
1030680	1035320	It's true that these days, regular people create a lot of the most popular art.
1035320	1041040	But what we create, the actual content of it, is molded by a very small number of companies
1041040	1043480	whose interests often go against our own.
1043480	1046320	Tech Talk alone decides who they'll end up platform.
1046320	1049320	We should think about what kind of messages that fosters.
1049320	1053800	To me, it seems like Tech Talk's goal is to convince you it's the beating heart of
1053800	1057360	modern culture, where everything interesting happens.
1057360	1062200	Beyond the literal content of a video, it's the variety you get while scrolling.
1062200	1067160	It's the sheer number of niches, telling the viewer they can have a little bit of everything
1067160	1068680	all the time.
1068680	1070200	And Tech Talk is where they'll find it.
1070200	1076360	I think content sludge is a perfect, like objectively perfect, carrier of that message.
1076360	1080320	It presents us with two or three drastically different videos at once.
1080320	1083640	A level of variety no other media can touch.
1083640	1086680	It offers us a chance at pure consumption.
1086680	1092320	Or what's being watched is secondary to the ritual of staring at a screen.
1092320	1096880	Each component substance is kept to a minimum, offering as little as possible to grapple
1096880	1097880	with.
1097880	1102080	To draw all our attention to the fact that we don't have to choose between the satisfaction
1102080	1106600	of a slime, the excitement of a mobile game, and the intrigue of a drama.
1106600	1110840	That as long as we stay right here, we can have it all.
1111160	1116280	And I guess what I'm trying to say with this video is fuck that.
1116280	1117280	We can't have it all.
1117280	1119160	We don't need it all.
1119160	1123400	The health of a media diet is not measured in total amount consumed.
1123400	1127440	We've been trained to accept whatever stale popcorn the algorithms toss our way.
1127440	1131960	Like, we can't tell the difference between filler and nourishment.
1131960	1136400	But some part of us does know, even as we're asked to forget our bodies.
1136400	1139160	Some part of us knows and hungers.
1139160	1142480	The larger problem here is not one you or I can solve.
1142480	1143480	We don't run TikTok.
1143480	1146480	We won't convince them to make their algorithm less effective.
1146480	1152080	And I'm not big on individualist solutions for this kind of problem that's just capitalism
1152080	1153840	doing its thing.
1153840	1158760	But if content sludge isn't going anywhere, I think we need to at least learn to make
1158760	1160400	ourselves less miserable.
1160400	1165080	Personally, my life became a lot more enjoyable when I started being intentional about my
1165080	1166080	media diet.
1166080	1170080	So no watching whatever an algorithm sticks in my face, no following trends for the sake
1170080	1171080	of it.
1171080	1175160	Instead, I've been paying attention to what speaks to me and actively seeking it out,
1175160	1178280	even when it's challenging or boring.
1178280	1181880	And it is boring sometimes, at least according to my busted attention span.
1181880	1184480	I'm realizing books are like really long.
1184480	1189040	For the past six months or so, I've been going to some local film screenings at museums
1189040	1190520	or small festivals.
1190520	1195120	I've seen like dozens of good movies, most of which you can only watch in person.
1195120	1197320	And I do live in a good city for that stuff.
1197320	1202120	But basically, no matter where you live, there are probably movie nerds putting on screenings.
1202120	1207120	There are probably art galleries you can walk into and find something totally moving.
1207120	1210240	There are probably local bands who'd love it if you went to their shows.
1210240	1213960	They're not usually very good, but that's not the point of a local scene.
1213960	1215960	It turns out most music is kind of bad.
1215960	1219040	If these things aren't feasible for you, don't worry about it.
1219040	1222680	Platforms like Rate Your Music and Letterbox are also great for getting under your bubble.
1222720	1224840	A lot of libraries have digital rentals now.
1227280	1233080	And hey, now that I think of it, there's always Nebula nailed it.
1233080	1237320	Since last year, I've been developing a movie podcast with my friends and fellow creators,
1237320	1239320	Lola Sebastian and Lady Emily.
1239320	1243600	When the show starts coming out, which is soon, not sure exactly when, but it's soon,
1243600	1249200	Nebula will get episodes a full two weeks early, plus some fun bonus episodes that won't be on streaming.
1249200	1255440	Honestly, if it weren't for Nebula's support, we never could have taken the time to make this weird, risky new thing.
1255440	1259560	But it's been so much fun just like hanging out with my friends, talking about movies.
1259560	1263360	We've put quite a lot of work into it, and I'm so glad it's coming together.
1263360	1268080	Nebula is a curated streaming service owned by its creators, including me.
1268080	1273080	It gives us a little more freedom to do our own thing and trust that people will find it if it speaks to them.
1273080	1278400	On Nebula, you'll find some of your favorite creators' catalogs free of ads or sponsorships,
1278400	1280960	which makes for a remarkably chill experience.
1280960	1284720	The interface is nice and clean, lots of choose from, but it never feels overwhelming.
1284720	1288600	One thing I really like is that we don't have a recommendation algorithm.
1288600	1293760	Everything you see on the homepage is handpicked by the Nebula team, and often there's a fun theme to it.
1293760	1299440	Like, right now we're highlighting our videos about women's history and the future of the human species.
1299440	1303440	If you sign up with the link right back there, you can get a discount from yours truly.
1303440	1306120	You can save 40% on an annual membership,
1306120	1312400	meaning you only pay like $2.50 a month to support me and over a hundred brilliant creators.
1312400	1318800	Head over to go.nebula.tv slash Lilly Alexander.
1318800	1321600	And now, as a thank you for sticking around to the end,
1321600	1330200	let me roll the credits up there and serenade you with the dulcet tones of this melodica I'm kind of okay at.
