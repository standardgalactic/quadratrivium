Processing Overview for Silicon Valley Forth Interest Group
============================
Checking Silicon Valley Forth Interest Group/2022-07-23 --- ÂµEForth on the Web --- Brad Nelson.txt
1. **Forth on the Web**: A live Forth interpreter has been implemented in JavaScript and embedded within a web page. This interpreter allows users to interact with Forth through a web interface, with support for text mode and limited graphics mode.
   
2. **Interactive Environment**: Users can input Forth words and see the results immediately. The system includes vocabularies for arithmetic, I/O operations, and more, with the potential to extend functionality.

3. **Graphics Support**: There is rudimentary graphics support inspired by the Apple II, where users can set colors, draw shapes, and toggle between text and graphic modes.

4. **Source Code**: The web page's source code is available on GitHub and contains minimal bootstrap code in JavaScript to initialize the environment. The bulk of the Forth interpreter, which includes a compiled C version's op codes and helper words for creating, parsing, converting, etc., is embedded within a large string at the bottom of the page.

5. **Development Continues**: The current implementation is a work in progress, with plans to improve support for terminal features and enhance the overall experience.

6. **Talk and Q&A**: A brief talk about the Forth interpreter on the web was given, and questions from the audience were encouraged. The interpreter's performance time is expected to be around 20 minutes, and the implementation is designed to be educational and illustrative of how such a system can be built using modern web technologies.
