0	14760	Today we will start talking about, so this week, so let me show you this slide, there
14760	25080	you go, one slide, life is critical, okay, so what do we mean by this?
25080	34720	So we talked about the laws of order, right?
34720	49360	Laws of disorder and laws of order, okay, do you remember?
49360	58320	Now, I will speculate, and many people did speculate, that life is between order and
58320	64840	disorder, okay, but how?
64840	71880	So life is at that critical place, life appears at that critical place, because life needs
71880	82680	order to sustain its processes, but life needs disorder to be adaptable to changes, okay?
82680	96120	So today we will look at what physicists mean when they talk about a critical system, disorder
96120	101720	order and the transition between them, phase transition.
101720	113240	So I want to start with a method called Monte Carlo method, have you heard of it, yes?
113240	123200	You have heard of it, you never tried it, just heard, right?
123200	128120	Have you heard of the casino, Monte Carlo?
128120	142120	Yes, so the method takes its name from the casino, okay, which is basically a place where
142120	153120	you throw dice, right, random number, so let's, usually this simple problem is stated for
153440	164040	understanding of Monte Carlo, so if I take random numbers between zero and one, okay,
164040	175200	random numbers, and then if I count the ones that are inside the unit circle divided by
175200	181800	the total number, what do you expect to get?
181920	194400	So pi times one over two squared divided by one squared, pi over four, right?
194400	211080	So let's actually do this, and if you throw enough dice, then let's call this set S1,
211080	220920	the number of S1 divided by total number will converge to pi over four, right?
220920	227000	So you can actually take this four to the other side and get an approximation of pi
227000	230640	as the run continues, right?
230640	238320	So we will not do it smoothly, we will just, okay, how many numbers do you want to, one
238320	253880	million, maybe, let me quickly change the font, okay?
253880	267240	So random numbers, two rows of random, no, columns, this one is column, right, two columns
267280	269920	of random numbers, right?
269920	275880	So how do you find the ones that are inside a unit circle?
275880	302400	We can do sum of r1 squared plus r2 squared, right, smaller than one, okay?
302400	309560	And divide it by n, multiply it with four, we should get pi, are you ready?
309560	317600	I haven't tried it before, there you go, we get pi to sum, okay, if I do it ten million
317600	332240	times, I get a better pi, not that better, yes, there you go, much better pi, right?
332520	334240	Are you with me?
334240	347360	Yes, so today we will talk about, so what Monte Carlo did is you throw some dice, you
347360	359560	have, you look at the system and you take an average over many trials and you get some
359560	369720	physical property, okay, today we will look at a particular case called, I think it's
369720	385200	called Ising model, not Ising, so Ising model models magnetization, have you heard of magnetization?
385200	393680	You know what the magnet is, yes, have you heard of Curie temperature, yes, what is Curie
393680	408920	temperature, again you have heard of it, yes, exactly, so if we have a magnet, let's say
408920	420200	this is T, okay, and this is magnetization, magnetization, like the total strength of
420200	429640	the magnet, if you are at zero temperature, okay, then all the tiny magnets are aligned,
429640	435440	so atomic magnets are aligned, so you have maximum magnetization, and as you increase
435440	445240	the temperature, those tiny magnets fluctuate, right, and when you reach at the Curie temperature,
445240	457840	you lose all magnetization, so zero magnet, so this is the phase transition, so you go
457840	471680	from order to disorder, okay, here magnets are aligned, so you have a net magnetization,
471680	485360	here they are disordered, do you have any questions so far, no, so we talked about order
485880	497600	laws, but we mainly focused on biological kind of order, like pattern formation or something,
497600	504200	there is one law of order that sits right in front of us, which is energy minimization,
504200	512680	okay, so if you are at zero temperature, things go to their minimum energy, right,
513600	522760	and for example atoms reach their minimum energy by making bonds with other atoms,
522760	530920	and why do we have order, because the atoms are very similar to each other, right, so their
530920	538560	environment eventually becomes similar, that's why you make, you form crystals, depending on
538560	546120	the bonding of the atoms, are you following my argument, so if you have carbon atoms,
546120	553960	10 to the 23 of them, each one interacting with the other one in the same fashion, so you expect
553960	561480	to get something ordered, because they are all the same, right, but if you increase the temperature,
562360	573000	and if those bonds are not strong enough, like in silicon, you get an amorphous material,
573000	590200	do you have any questions so far, okay, so what about magnets, this easing model is very simple,
590760	601440	but very rich, so it describes, do you remember this u equals to minus mu dot b,
601440	611440	you remember from physics 102, magnetic moments get lower energy when they are aligned with
611640	630080	magnetic field, why are you smiling, okay, so now we will look at the case when two magnets interact,
630080	640360	in fact we will even simplify it further and we'll assume that these tiny magnets can either have
640400	656000	upstate or downstate, do you have any questions so far, so let's call these states S1 and S2 as a vector,
656000	665800	okay, and the energy, the interaction energy between them, if I write it this, in this way,
665880	674200	where J is positive, what kind of interaction do they have, do they want to be aligned or
675640	682520	not aligned, do they want to stay opposite to each other or to stay in the same direction,
683000	697160	so let's derive, so if both of them is one, okay, like if both of them are aligned, what is the energy
699560	706600	minus J, right, if they are opposite one and minus one, what is the energy
706760	718520	plus J, which one is lower energy, minus J, so they want to be aligned, okay, do you have any
718520	728680	questions so far, did you miss anything so far, so when this is positive you have a ferromagnetic
729080	737160	interaction, ferromagnetic, okay, when J is negative what do you have,
737160	762440	no, no, anti-ferromagnetic, thank you all, so you have anti-ferromagnetic state where all
763000	773160	spins want to be opposite, all neighbors want to be opposite to each other, did I draw it
773160	780280	properly, no, so you will have something like this, do you have any questions so far, yes,
781240	788440	this is one big question, how do you know if an object is anti-ferromagnetic, not
790760	796040	nothing else, very good question, that's a very good question,
796680	812520	so in the calculation that I do, for example, if I am allowed to switch off the magnetic interaction,
813480	820760	then I see that non-magnetic state has higher energy than anti-ferromagnetic state, did you follow,
821240	829480	so I can do calculations using dense function theory, for example, right, so I take a material,
830280	839160	I do a non-magnetic calculation, I get an energy value E1, then I do a magnetic calculation,
840840	847080	magnetic interaction is on, okay, but I see zero magnetization
847080	854520	at the end of the calculation, but I see that E2 is smaller than E1,
856600	861480	but how about experiments, right, what would you see in experiments,
866760	873640	I don't know, okay, but did you get a gist of an answer here,
874360	876200	yes, I hope so,
888840	890920	that's a very good approach,
893560	900200	so you can see the dynamics of the system with respect to applied magnetic field,
901160	903160	you are not happy,
911320	919000	I think so, like, first of all, this one will not get magnetized at all, I guess,
922680	928360	so this one, the non-magnetic material would not interact with magnetic field,
931160	941160	because its spins are all fulfilled, they are dream, they have all found their peers,
947960	950360	well we are at the edge of my knowledge, so let's,
952760	959480	this is embarrassing, but I don't know, I don't have a good answer, so let's move on,
960920	963400	so we will look at ferromagnetic case,
969080	978760	where you expect all spins to be aligned eventually at zero Kelvin, right, so let's look at,
979480	983480	I'm sorry, can I ask you a question,
985480	987880	about the alignment of course,
989320	993880	so is it like something one dimension, could they all be facing the same way,
997880	1003640	I mean like are we defining how it is like, they are either facing the same direction,
1004200	1010040	or they are not, but not specific like this, or could there be something like this,
1011800	1014440	okay, so is it one dimension,
1016120	1026840	in our model, there are only two states, like on and off, okay, but normally there are these things
1026840	1036440	called magnons, like phonons, photons, electrons, they are magnons, that corresponds to
1039400	1040200	this kind of
1044520	1050520	oscillation, like let's say they are all aligned, but you introduce
1051400	1056680	just like in the atoms, when they are at their equilibrium,
1058520	1066520	if you, what, yes, precession, yes, very good, so if you just disturb this atom,
1066520	1074200	it will create a wave, right, and we call them phonons, okay, in the similar fashion,
1075080	1083640	if you have like perfectly aligned magnetic moments, and then you process one of them,
1083640	1089800	and that interacts with the other, processes the other, and you create a wave that acts
1089800	1098040	as a particle called magnon, yes, yes, and
1098120	1111880	this is again, I don't want to go into too much discussion, but have you heard of quantum mechanics?
1114520	1124600	Yes, so there weird things happen, like if you are measuring spin of an electron
1125160	1130600	in a certain direction, you either get plus one over two or minus one over two,
1132680	1142040	although they could have been, I mean, quantum mechanically, when you operate on something,
1142040	1153800	it just goes to one of its eigenvalues, so it's not far away from the truth,
1154360	1167880	this interaction, thank you, so let's think of four spins, okay, just four spins,
1169560	1175000	so how much energy do we have here in total?
1175000	1189720	Go ahead, don't be scared, minus 4j, just four spins,
1195960	1200840	yes, like this interaction, this interaction, this and this, we don't have this interaction,
1201560	1212840	okay, do you have any questions so far? No, so let's look at another state where this
1214840	1217800	is present, so what is the total energy here?
1218280	1226120	Minus 2j, very good, right, so what about
1231000	1231320	is it?
1236680	1245800	Zero, I trust you, so minus minus plus plus, you're right, so what about this one?
1248200	1260840	What is the check plus 4j? Plus 4j, okay, so remember Boltzmann distribution,
1260840	1271080	do you remember it? This is the probability of a certain state, KBT, do you remember this?
1271400	1277880	So, if you are at a certain temperature, let's say you are at a certain temperature,
1278680	1286280	the probability of having this state is e to the minus 4j over KBT, I mean,
1289480	1295080	if you want to find the probability, you need to sum all other probabilities, right,
1295960	1301960	plus for example, this one is e to the zero KBT
1304120	1309080	and e to the 4j over KBT, do you understand what I'm doing?
1310840	1316360	So, let's say this is the total probabilities, this is the probability of this one happening,
1316360	1324920	so it's very small, right, compared to others, this is more probable and this is the most probable,
1325560	1332520	actually, in fact, if you go to zero temperature, this will be infinitely more probable than the
1332520	1339400	other, so it will be the only possibility and it will go there, did you follow so far the discussion,
1339400	1345560	yes? So, what we are going to do is we are going to simulate
1345960	1357320	any configuration of spins at a certain temperature, okay, at a certain temperature.
1358360	1365080	So, how do we do this? How will we do this and how it will connect to Monte Carlo method?
1366040	1381720	Well, there we have Nicholas Metropolis, okay, from Los Alamos, by the way, I want to point out Los Alamos guys,
1384520	1394760	okay, they built the A-bomb, that's a different story, but Los Alamos brought so many brilliant
1394760	1404200	people, right, let's just name them Feynman von Neumann, right, Metropolis, Fermi, who else?
1405640	1418440	Ulam, definitely, and many others, right, and Feigenbaum, by the way, Los Alamos, so some,
1418600	1427960	and generally numerically interesting thing came out of there, because that was the place
1427960	1435720	where computers were used massively for the first time, I guess, right, to calculate the effect of
1436520	1446840	the explosion, you agree? So, let's just look at Metropolis's Magnum Opus,
1447800	1459320	the greatest work of Metropolis, where is it? Just if we type Nicholas Metropolis
1459720	1464360	and maybe Metropolis Monte Carlo,
1470200	1475720	it's not, no?
1479240	1485720	I wanted to show you the citations, it's more than, it's around 7,000,
1486200	1491560	but I will show you the paper, never mind, so this is the paper,
1494600	1500920	equation of state calculation by fast computing machines, like iPhones,
1503640	1515400	okay, so, this is, is this the part where the sublime part, yes,
1516680	1522280	we then calculate the change in energy of the system, delta E, which is caused by the move,
1523160	1529720	if delta E is smaller than zero, if the move would bring the system to a lower state energy,
1529720	1535000	we allow the move and put the particle in its new position, I will explain this, but
1535640	1541160	let's read it first from the original, if delta E is bigger than zero, we allow the move with the
1541160	1555800	probability of this one, E to the minus delta E KBT, so here,
1559720	1562360	I will tell you something more from this,
1562600	1572200	let me find that word, those words,
1575960	1589560	it will be worth it, just let me find,
1592520	1596680	okay, never mind, so,
1600040	1606360	I had some point here, let me make that point, and everything will be clear, I promise you, okay,
1607240	1612600	so how would you calculate magnetization in this system?
1612600	1624200	Let's say you put four spins into a temperature of some T, and you want to
1624200	1627880	find the total magnetization, how would you calculate it?
1627880	1643560	Well, I'm talking about this simple system that has, so what you are going to do is,
1644200	1651000	for all possibilities, you have the energies, right, and those energies will give you the
1651000	1659880	probabilities, do you agree? So, what is this total magnetization in this system?
1662680	1670920	Four, right, if it's one plus one plus one, it's four, so can I do the following? I integrate
1670920	1681480	over all possible states the probability of being at that energy times the magnetization
1681480	1696360	at that energy, yes, yes, it's the expectation of magnetization, did you follow this? Yes,
1696440	1704360	so what we did is, we look at, we sampled the whole system, then we took the possibilities,
1705640	1713480	and we multiplied them to find the average. Metropolis Monte Carlo approaches it a different
1713480	1727960	way, okay, it samples with that probability, then it takes the average. So, let me restate this,
1730520	1738760	in this case, we take all possibilities, multiply them with their probabilities,
1738760	1749160	then sum them up, right, then average them out. In the metropolis case, you choose,
1749160	1761080	you already choose the systems with the relevant probabilities, and then you average them out.
1761240	1767640	Maybe, who can explain what I just told you?
1781640	1788040	Yes, that's the bad version, yes, so what is the good version?
1791080	1796440	The good version, they just take the, not the all the probability, but just take some of those,
1796440	1800360	and at the end of the day, you can get all the probabilities, right?
1800360	1810520	You take the states according to their probability already, you sample them according to their
1810520	1816600	probability, then you take those samples and you take the average. If I could find that sentence,
1816600	1824440	it's much better put in Metropolis's paper, please go ahead and read it and find that sentence.
1832040	1840600	So, let me restate it one final time. Instead of taking all possible states and averaging them
1840600	1847560	according to their probabilities, we take the states according to their probabilities and
1847560	1853960	average them out. The number of states in the first case is, the number of states, I think,
1855960	1863480	no, that's the whole point. The number in the first case, I have to take all numbers,
1864200	1865880	everything, everything that is possible.
1872120	1879320	Let me tell you what what I take. So, Metropolis algorithm tells you that you should take them
1879320	1890920	in the following way. So, let's say you pick one single spin and you calculate what happens if you
1890920	1899640	flip it, okay? That's how you calculate delta E. So, let's say you are here
1902360	1909080	and I choose this one. What is the change in the energy if I flip it? Be careful
1911240	1912360	when you calculate this.
1921880	1922360	Yes?
1923560	1938600	So, 8j. Do you agree? Yes. So, Metropolis says that we should accept this flip with this probability
1938600	1946360	minus 8j over kBT, okay? And what if you have something like this?
1946680	1952920	Something like this. What if you flip this one?
1956440	1957560	What is the delta E?
1962760	1969960	Minus 8j. Everybody agrees? It's 4j before, then it's minus 4j. Did you follow?
1970840	1977160	And according to Metropolis algorithm, if the energy decreases, you accept it.
1978520	1985800	Okay? So, by doing this, energy decreases accept, energy increases accept with this probability.
1985800	1992920	If you continue doing this, then you are sampling according to Boltzmann distribution eventually.
1993160	2003080	Okay? I didn't, I was expecting that this part will take like 10 minutes, but it took 30.
2004040	2012680	So, I will not explain many details of this code. I hope you can figure it out.
2012840	2023880	So, by the way, the only possible, by the flips, the only possible energy chains are
2023880	2037000	minus 8j minus 4j, 0 plus 4j and plus 8j. So, if the energy change is minus 8j,
2037000	2044680	then there is one probability of switching. If it's minus 4j, one probability. What is, what if
2045640	2054760	the energy change is 0? Again, one probability because e to the 0 over kBT, right? But the others
2054760	2061800	will switch with this probability. Okay? Did you follow all this? So, I will start with random
2062760	2072040	spins, up and downs. And this part, you can see that this is the flip, the spin.
2074280	2081320	That's all. And just these parts are making sure that you are choosing a random spin,
2081320	2088040	and according to the probability, you flip it. Did you follow? So, let's run it and see what
2089000	2101320	we get. We get this interesting structure. I have to point out here that this is not the
2101960	2111400	real dynamics. Okay? This is not like molecular dynamics. It's just we are sampling the system.
2112040	2114760	Are you following? Do you agree?
2122040	2123320	200 by 200.
2128280	2136360	No, that's a very good point. So, each time this picture changes, we actually flip
2137320	2146520	200 squared spins. Not at the same time. That's very good. All of those are very good points,
2146520	2154040	but I have very short time, unfortunately. Can you give me five more minutes after 10.30? Yes?
2154600	2165560	Okay. So, you are flipping each spin. I mean, you are each time looking at one spin.
2166520	2176200	And here, I actually do that n squared times, but not necessarily with the same order.
2177080	2183960	Randomly, I pick n squared times. I pick one spin. Should I flip it or not?
2185000	2188920	With certain probability, I flip it or not? Did you follow all this?
2194520	2200040	Sometimes, one spin doesn't get picked at this n squared runs, but that's okay.
2200360	2211240	Okay. So, let's see. So, right now, KBT is 2. What if I change temperature?
2213000	2224360	So, let's go to this code. So, here, I will start with 1.5. T minimum is 1.5. I will go to
2225320	2231240	maximum temperature of 3. Then, I will go back to 1.5. Then, I will go back to 3.
2231800	2237480	So, I want you to see what happens when the temperature is changed. Okay? Ready?
2239800	2248680	So, this is low temperature, which means that you have aligned magnets. Do you agree?
2249480	2258360	Okay? The blue parts are minus spins. So, they are all aligned. You have big magnetization.
2258360	2263240	Now, we are approaching this critical temperature where you have transition
2264280	2273400	to from order. This is order and you are going towards disorder. Okay? Where your magnetization
2273400	2287480	will go down to zero. So, you can see that we have almost equal amount of plus ones and minus ones.
2291080	2292680	Are you following all this?
2293640	2304200	Let's... Now, did we reach the maximum temperature? We have reached it
2305640	2312600	now. Now, we go back. So, what will happen when we go back? Any ideas?
2312600	2314600	Yes?
2321320	2323320	Yes?
2326440	2333080	Once you go below critical temperature, you should see the order reappear.
2334040	2346280	Right? Domains. Very good. So, you will see domains appear and those domains, one of them will dominate.
2347160	2352360	We don't know which one. So, I think right now my bet is on yellow one.
2353640	2359080	Right? One of them will dominate and flip the others. No? Blue one?
2363400	2364920	So, I am taking the bets.
2367560	2369960	Blue? Yellow. Yellow? Okay.
2372440	2374440	No one else?
2378600	2392840	Yes. Yes, yes. There is a hysteresis and again let me restate.
2392920	2400920	This is not an actual simulation of a magnet. We are just sampling the system. Are you confused?
2402200	2415480	No? So, this easy model is not easy to solve at all. Okay? Although the name suggests that way.
2416280	2427960	So, it was solved by this genius, Lars Onsager. Have you heard of him? Not many people have heard of him.
2433480	2441160	Yes, critical systems and far from equilibrium systems, right? He got the Nobel Prize in 1968
2441160	2446120	for this stuff and he actually solved the easing model
2451640	2459880	analytically. Can you believe it? Genius. So, let's look at that paper.
2463080	2468520	Two-dimensional model with an older disorder transition. Let's just skip through this
2469480	2479240	paper and you will see like different mathematics introduced to solve this quaternion algebra.
2481400	2487160	So, 33 pages of pure beauty. Do you see it?
2487400	2497960	Well, there's only his name here but let's go to acknowledgments
2500120	2502440	which is before this long appendix.
2506280	2507800	Is this still the appendix?
2508120	2510040	No acknowledgment.
2513720	2526600	Yes, what is the year? 1943. Right in the middle of the war. He solved this problem.
2527160	2537800	So, he gave us a very nice formula. Okay? Let's find that formula for critical temperature.
2538600	2544520	Where the critical temperature occurs? Let's go ahead and find that formula.
2548680	2549560	Yes, there it is.
2550440	2561160	So, if you rearrange it, ktc over j should be this weird number 2 over ln 1 plus square root 2.
2561720	2571800	Okay? And we also have the formula for magnetization. Where is that formula?
2572760	2576920	So, we have analytical solution.
2580440	2583880	Never mind. I have this formula in my code.
2588200	2598360	Let me show you. This is that formula. 1 minus sin hyperbolic 2 times j over kbt
2599320	2605720	to the power of minus 4 in the brackets to the power of 1 over 8. Never mind.
2606360	2614200	So, what I will do here, are you following? Yes? What I will do here is I will go from,
2615480	2622520	so I will define tc to be this number 2 over logarithm 1 plus something. And I will go from
2622520	2630200	half of the critical temperature to the 1.5 of the critical temperature. Okay? And each time
2631560	2641000	we will start, we will do how many runs? Let's see. We will do 1000 different runs.
2642360	2650120	Okay? Each one flipping the spins 200 square times. So,
2650120	2662200	200 square times 1000 gives you 40 million. Right? So, we will sample 40 million pictures
2662200	2676760	from the system. Do you agree? And, well, let's run this code. And while it runs, I will talk about it.
2681080	2687560	So, we have run the first one of this temperature. So, let me...
2692520	2705160	What we are doing is, this one is t critical. So, we start from 0.5 t critical. And we take the system,
2705160	2717480	we run the system 1000 times and each time we flip 200 squared spins. But we only take the
2717480	2727320	last 100 steps and average the magnetization from those pictures. Did you follow? Yes?
2727320	2736840	What do we expect to get? So, magnetization versus temperature. What would you expect?
2738920	2743480	Let's say all spins pointing at the same direction is 1.
2746120	2752760	So, when the temperature is low, it should be very close to 1. Right? Then at this point,
2753480	2764120	it has to go sharply to 0. Right? And remain at 0 forever. Right? Let's see the result.
2765320	2776680	There you go. And what is this line? The red line? Yes, analytical solution of metropolis. Do you see
2776680	2785720	that our numerical calculation using metropolis algorithm is matching it almost perfectly?
2787000	2801400	Do you have any questions? So, this particular point where it switches will be critical for life.
2801400	2810520	So, this is where life wants to be, at the criticality. And at least now you have a sense
2810520	2819160	of order and disorder. Next time we will explore those concepts even further. Do you have any
2819160	2828920	questions? No? Thank you all. Take care.
