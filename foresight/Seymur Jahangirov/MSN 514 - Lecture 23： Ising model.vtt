00:00.000 --> 00:14.760
Today we will start talking about, so this week, so let me show you this slide, there

00:14.760 --> 00:25.080
you go, one slide, life is critical, okay, so what do we mean by this?

00:25.080 --> 00:34.720
So we talked about the laws of order, right?

00:34.720 --> 00:49.360
Laws of disorder and laws of order, okay, do you remember?

00:49.360 --> 00:58.320
Now, I will speculate, and many people did speculate, that life is between order and

00:58.320 --> 01:04.840
disorder, okay, but how?

01:04.840 --> 01:11.880
So life is at that critical place, life appears at that critical place, because life needs

01:11.880 --> 01:22.680
order to sustain its processes, but life needs disorder to be adaptable to changes, okay?

01:22.680 --> 01:36.120
So today we will look at what physicists mean when they talk about a critical system, disorder

01:36.120 --> 01:41.720
order and the transition between them, phase transition.

01:41.720 --> 01:53.240
So I want to start with a method called Monte Carlo method, have you heard of it, yes?

01:53.240 --> 02:03.200
You have heard of it, you never tried it, just heard, right?

02:03.200 --> 02:08.120
Have you heard of the casino, Monte Carlo?

02:08.120 --> 02:22.120
Yes, so the method takes its name from the casino, okay, which is basically a place where

02:22.120 --> 02:33.120
you throw dice, right, random number, so let's, usually this simple problem is stated for

02:33.440 --> 02:44.040
understanding of Monte Carlo, so if I take random numbers between zero and one, okay,

02:44.040 --> 02:55.200
random numbers, and then if I count the ones that are inside the unit circle divided by

02:55.200 --> 03:01.800
the total number, what do you expect to get?

03:01.920 --> 03:14.400
So pi times one over two squared divided by one squared, pi over four, right?

03:14.400 --> 03:31.080
So let's actually do this, and if you throw enough dice, then let's call this set S1,

03:31.080 --> 03:40.920
the number of S1 divided by total number will converge to pi over four, right?

03:40.920 --> 03:47.000
So you can actually take this four to the other side and get an approximation of pi

03:47.000 --> 03:50.640
as the run continues, right?

03:50.640 --> 03:58.320
So we will not do it smoothly, we will just, okay, how many numbers do you want to, one

03:58.320 --> 04:13.880
million, maybe, let me quickly change the font, okay?

04:13.880 --> 04:27.240
So random numbers, two rows of random, no, columns, this one is column, right, two columns

04:27.280 --> 04:29.920
of random numbers, right?

04:29.920 --> 04:35.880
So how do you find the ones that are inside a unit circle?

04:35.880 --> 05:02.400
We can do sum of r1 squared plus r2 squared, right, smaller than one, okay?

05:02.400 --> 05:09.560
And divide it by n, multiply it with four, we should get pi, are you ready?

05:09.560 --> 05:17.600
I haven't tried it before, there you go, we get pi to sum, okay, if I do it ten million

05:17.600 --> 05:32.240
times, I get a better pi, not that better, yes, there you go, much better pi, right?

05:32.520 --> 05:34.240
Are you with me?

05:34.240 --> 05:47.360
Yes, so today we will talk about, so what Monte Carlo did is you throw some dice, you

05:47.360 --> 05:59.560
have, you look at the system and you take an average over many trials and you get some

05:59.560 --> 06:09.720
physical property, okay, today we will look at a particular case called, I think it's

06:09.720 --> 06:25.200
called Ising model, not Ising, so Ising model models magnetization, have you heard of magnetization?

06:25.200 --> 06:33.680
You know what the magnet is, yes, have you heard of Curie temperature, yes, what is Curie

06:33.680 --> 06:48.920
temperature, again you have heard of it, yes, exactly, so if we have a magnet, let's say

06:48.920 --> 07:00.200
this is T, okay, and this is magnetization, magnetization, like the total strength of

07:00.200 --> 07:09.640
the magnet, if you are at zero temperature, okay, then all the tiny magnets are aligned,

07:09.640 --> 07:15.440
so atomic magnets are aligned, so you have maximum magnetization, and as you increase

07:15.440 --> 07:25.240
the temperature, those tiny magnets fluctuate, right, and when you reach at the Curie temperature,

07:25.240 --> 07:37.840
you lose all magnetization, so zero magnet, so this is the phase transition, so you go

07:37.840 --> 07:51.680
from order to disorder, okay, here magnets are aligned, so you have a net magnetization,

07:51.680 --> 08:05.360
here they are disordered, do you have any questions so far, no, so we talked about order

08:05.880 --> 08:17.600
laws, but we mainly focused on biological kind of order, like pattern formation or something,

08:17.600 --> 08:24.200
there is one law of order that sits right in front of us, which is energy minimization,

08:24.200 --> 08:32.680
okay, so if you are at zero temperature, things go to their minimum energy, right,

08:33.600 --> 08:42.760
and for example atoms reach their minimum energy by making bonds with other atoms,

08:42.760 --> 08:50.920
and why do we have order, because the atoms are very similar to each other, right, so their

08:50.920 --> 08:58.560
environment eventually becomes similar, that's why you make, you form crystals, depending on

08:58.560 --> 09:06.120
the bonding of the atoms, are you following my argument, so if you have carbon atoms,

09:06.120 --> 09:13.960
10 to the 23 of them, each one interacting with the other one in the same fashion, so you expect

09:13.960 --> 09:21.480
to get something ordered, because they are all the same, right, but if you increase the temperature,

09:22.360 --> 09:33.000
and if those bonds are not strong enough, like in silicon, you get an amorphous material,

09:33.000 --> 09:50.200
do you have any questions so far, okay, so what about magnets, this easing model is very simple,

09:50.760 --> 10:01.440
but very rich, so it describes, do you remember this u equals to minus mu dot b,

10:01.440 --> 10:11.440
you remember from physics 102, magnetic moments get lower energy when they are aligned with

10:11.640 --> 10:30.080
magnetic field, why are you smiling, okay, so now we will look at the case when two magnets interact,

10:30.080 --> 10:40.360
in fact we will even simplify it further and we'll assume that these tiny magnets can either have

10:40.400 --> 10:56.000
upstate or downstate, do you have any questions so far, so let's call these states S1 and S2 as a vector,

10:56.000 --> 11:05.800
okay, and the energy, the interaction energy between them, if I write it this, in this way,

11:05.880 --> 11:14.200
where J is positive, what kind of interaction do they have, do they want to be aligned or

11:15.640 --> 11:22.520
not aligned, do they want to stay opposite to each other or to stay in the same direction,

11:23.000 --> 11:37.160
so let's derive, so if both of them is one, okay, like if both of them are aligned, what is the energy

11:39.560 --> 11:46.600
minus J, right, if they are opposite one and minus one, what is the energy

11:46.760 --> 11:58.520
plus J, which one is lower energy, minus J, so they want to be aligned, okay, do you have any

11:58.520 --> 12:08.680
questions so far, did you miss anything so far, so when this is positive you have a ferromagnetic

12:09.080 --> 12:17.160
interaction, ferromagnetic, okay, when J is negative what do you have,

12:17.160 --> 12:42.440
no, no, anti-ferromagnetic, thank you all, so you have anti-ferromagnetic state where all

12:43.000 --> 12:53.160
spins want to be opposite, all neighbors want to be opposite to each other, did I draw it

12:53.160 --> 13:00.280
properly, no, so you will have something like this, do you have any questions so far, yes,

13:01.240 --> 13:08.440
this is one big question, how do you know if an object is anti-ferromagnetic, not

13:10.760 --> 13:16.040
nothing else, very good question, that's a very good question,

13:16.680 --> 13:32.520
so in the calculation that I do, for example, if I am allowed to switch off the magnetic interaction,

13:33.480 --> 13:40.760
then I see that non-magnetic state has higher energy than anti-ferromagnetic state, did you follow,

13:41.240 --> 13:49.480
so I can do calculations using dense function theory, for example, right, so I take a material,

13:50.280 --> 13:59.160
I do a non-magnetic calculation, I get an energy value E1, then I do a magnetic calculation,

14:00.840 --> 14:07.080
magnetic interaction is on, okay, but I see zero magnetization

14:07.080 --> 14:14.520
at the end of the calculation, but I see that E2 is smaller than E1,

14:16.600 --> 14:21.480
but how about experiments, right, what would you see in experiments,

14:26.760 --> 14:33.640
I don't know, okay, but did you get a gist of an answer here,

14:34.360 --> 14:36.200
yes, I hope so,

14:48.840 --> 14:50.920
that's a very good approach,

14:53.560 --> 15:00.200
so you can see the dynamics of the system with respect to applied magnetic field,

15:01.160 --> 15:03.160
you are not happy,

15:11.320 --> 15:19.000
I think so, like, first of all, this one will not get magnetized at all, I guess,

15:22.680 --> 15:28.360
so this one, the non-magnetic material would not interact with magnetic field,

15:31.160 --> 15:41.160
because its spins are all fulfilled, they are dream, they have all found their peers,

15:47.960 --> 15:50.360
well we are at the edge of my knowledge, so let's,

15:52.760 --> 15:59.480
this is embarrassing, but I don't know, I don't have a good answer, so let's move on,

16:00.920 --> 16:03.400
so we will look at ferromagnetic case,

16:09.080 --> 16:18.760
where you expect all spins to be aligned eventually at zero Kelvin, right, so let's look at,

16:19.480 --> 16:23.480
I'm sorry, can I ask you a question,

16:25.480 --> 16:27.880
about the alignment of course,

16:29.320 --> 16:33.880
so is it like something one dimension, could they all be facing the same way,

16:37.880 --> 16:43.640
I mean like are we defining how it is like, they are either facing the same direction,

16:44.200 --> 16:50.040
or they are not, but not specific like this, or could there be something like this,

16:51.800 --> 16:54.440
okay, so is it one dimension,

16:56.120 --> 17:06.840
in our model, there are only two states, like on and off, okay, but normally there are these things

17:06.840 --> 17:16.440
called magnons, like phonons, photons, electrons, they are magnons, that corresponds to

17:19.400 --> 17:20.200
this kind of

17:24.520 --> 17:30.520
oscillation, like let's say they are all aligned, but you introduce

17:31.400 --> 17:36.680
just like in the atoms, when they are at their equilibrium,

17:38.520 --> 17:46.520
if you, what, yes, precession, yes, very good, so if you just disturb this atom,

17:46.520 --> 17:54.200
it will create a wave, right, and we call them phonons, okay, in the similar fashion,

17:55.080 --> 18:03.640
if you have like perfectly aligned magnetic moments, and then you process one of them,

18:03.640 --> 18:09.800
and that interacts with the other, processes the other, and you create a wave that acts

18:09.800 --> 18:18.040
as a particle called magnon, yes, yes, and

18:18.120 --> 18:31.880
this is again, I don't want to go into too much discussion, but have you heard of quantum mechanics?

18:34.520 --> 18:44.600
Yes, so there weird things happen, like if you are measuring spin of an electron

18:45.160 --> 18:50.600
in a certain direction, you either get plus one over two or minus one over two,

18:52.680 --> 19:02.040
although they could have been, I mean, quantum mechanically, when you operate on something,

19:02.040 --> 19:13.800
it just goes to one of its eigenvalues, so it's not far away from the truth,

19:14.360 --> 19:27.880
this interaction, thank you, so let's think of four spins, okay, just four spins,

19:29.560 --> 19:35.000
so how much energy do we have here in total?

19:35.000 --> 19:49.720
Go ahead, don't be scared, minus 4j, just four spins,

19:55.960 --> 20:00.840
yes, like this interaction, this interaction, this and this, we don't have this interaction,

20:01.560 --> 20:12.840
okay, do you have any questions so far? No, so let's look at another state where this

20:14.840 --> 20:17.800
is present, so what is the total energy here?

20:18.280 --> 20:26.120
Minus 2j, very good, right, so what about

20:31.000 --> 20:31.320
is it?

20:36.680 --> 20:45.800
Zero, I trust you, so minus minus plus plus, you're right, so what about this one?

20:48.200 --> 21:00.840
What is the check plus 4j? Plus 4j, okay, so remember Boltzmann distribution,

21:00.840 --> 21:11.080
do you remember it? This is the probability of a certain state, KBT, do you remember this?

21:11.400 --> 21:17.880
So, if you are at a certain temperature, let's say you are at a certain temperature,

21:18.680 --> 21:26.280
the probability of having this state is e to the minus 4j over KBT, I mean,

21:29.480 --> 21:35.080
if you want to find the probability, you need to sum all other probabilities, right,

21:35.960 --> 21:41.960
plus for example, this one is e to the zero KBT

21:44.120 --> 21:49.080
and e to the 4j over KBT, do you understand what I'm doing?

21:50.840 --> 21:56.360
So, let's say this is the total probabilities, this is the probability of this one happening,

21:56.360 --> 22:04.920
so it's very small, right, compared to others, this is more probable and this is the most probable,

22:05.560 --> 22:12.520
actually, in fact, if you go to zero temperature, this will be infinitely more probable than the

22:12.520 --> 22:19.400
other, so it will be the only possibility and it will go there, did you follow so far the discussion,

22:19.400 --> 22:25.560
yes? So, what we are going to do is we are going to simulate

22:25.960 --> 22:37.320
any configuration of spins at a certain temperature, okay, at a certain temperature.

22:38.360 --> 22:45.080
So, how do we do this? How will we do this and how it will connect to Monte Carlo method?

22:46.040 --> 23:01.720
Well, there we have Nicholas Metropolis, okay, from Los Alamos, by the way, I want to point out Los Alamos guys,

23:04.520 --> 23:14.760
okay, they built the A-bomb, that's a different story, but Los Alamos brought so many brilliant

23:14.760 --> 23:24.200
people, right, let's just name them Feynman von Neumann, right, Metropolis, Fermi, who else?

23:25.640 --> 23:38.440
Ulam, definitely, and many others, right, and Feigenbaum, by the way, Los Alamos, so some,

23:38.600 --> 23:47.960
and generally numerically interesting thing came out of there, because that was the place

23:47.960 --> 23:55.720
where computers were used massively for the first time, I guess, right, to calculate the effect of

23:56.520 --> 24:06.840
the explosion, you agree? So, let's just look at Metropolis's Magnum Opus,

24:07.800 --> 24:19.320
the greatest work of Metropolis, where is it? Just if we type Nicholas Metropolis

24:19.720 --> 24:24.360
and maybe Metropolis Monte Carlo,

24:30.200 --> 24:35.720
it's not, no?

24:39.240 --> 24:45.720
I wanted to show you the citations, it's more than, it's around 7,000,

24:46.200 --> 24:51.560
but I will show you the paper, never mind, so this is the paper,

24:54.600 --> 25:00.920
equation of state calculation by fast computing machines, like iPhones,

25:03.640 --> 25:15.400
okay, so, this is, is this the part where the sublime part, yes,

25:16.680 --> 25:22.280
we then calculate the change in energy of the system, delta E, which is caused by the move,

25:23.160 --> 25:29.720
if delta E is smaller than zero, if the move would bring the system to a lower state energy,

25:29.720 --> 25:35.000
we allow the move and put the particle in its new position, I will explain this, but

25:35.640 --> 25:41.160
let's read it first from the original, if delta E is bigger than zero, we allow the move with the

25:41.160 --> 25:55.800
probability of this one, E to the minus delta E KBT, so here,

25:59.720 --> 26:02.360
I will tell you something more from this,

26:02.600 --> 26:12.200
let me find that word, those words,

26:15.960 --> 26:29.560
it will be worth it, just let me find,

26:32.520 --> 26:36.680
okay, never mind, so,

26:40.040 --> 26:46.360
I had some point here, let me make that point, and everything will be clear, I promise you, okay,

26:47.240 --> 26:52.600
so how would you calculate magnetization in this system?

26:52.600 --> 27:04.200
Let's say you put four spins into a temperature of some T, and you want to

27:04.200 --> 27:07.880
find the total magnetization, how would you calculate it?

27:07.880 --> 27:23.560
Well, I'm talking about this simple system that has, so what you are going to do is,

27:24.200 --> 27:31.000
for all possibilities, you have the energies, right, and those energies will give you the

27:31.000 --> 27:39.880
probabilities, do you agree? So, what is this total magnetization in this system?

27:42.680 --> 27:50.920
Four, right, if it's one plus one plus one, it's four, so can I do the following? I integrate

27:50.920 --> 28:01.480
over all possible states the probability of being at that energy times the magnetization

28:01.480 --> 28:16.360
at that energy, yes, yes, it's the expectation of magnetization, did you follow this? Yes,

28:16.440 --> 28:24.360
so what we did is, we look at, we sampled the whole system, then we took the possibilities,

28:25.640 --> 28:33.480
and we multiplied them to find the average. Metropolis Monte Carlo approaches it a different

28:33.480 --> 28:47.960
way, okay, it samples with that probability, then it takes the average. So, let me restate this,

28:50.520 --> 28:58.760
in this case, we take all possibilities, multiply them with their probabilities,

28:58.760 --> 29:09.160
then sum them up, right, then average them out. In the metropolis case, you choose,

29:09.160 --> 29:21.080
you already choose the systems with the relevant probabilities, and then you average them out.

29:21.240 --> 29:27.640
Maybe, who can explain what I just told you?

29:41.640 --> 29:48.040
Yes, that's the bad version, yes, so what is the good version?

29:51.080 --> 29:56.440
The good version, they just take the, not the all the probability, but just take some of those,

29:56.440 --> 30:00.360
and at the end of the day, you can get all the probabilities, right?

30:00.360 --> 30:10.520
You take the states according to their probability already, you sample them according to their

30:10.520 --> 30:16.600
probability, then you take those samples and you take the average. If I could find that sentence,

30:16.600 --> 30:24.440
it's much better put in Metropolis's paper, please go ahead and read it and find that sentence.

30:32.040 --> 30:40.600
So, let me restate it one final time. Instead of taking all possible states and averaging them

30:40.600 --> 30:47.560
according to their probabilities, we take the states according to their probabilities and

30:47.560 --> 30:53.960
average them out. The number of states in the first case is, the number of states, I think,

30:55.960 --> 31:03.480
no, that's the whole point. The number in the first case, I have to take all numbers,

31:04.200 --> 31:05.880
everything, everything that is possible.

31:12.120 --> 31:19.320
Let me tell you what what I take. So, Metropolis algorithm tells you that you should take them

31:19.320 --> 31:30.920
in the following way. So, let's say you pick one single spin and you calculate what happens if you

31:30.920 --> 31:39.640
flip it, okay? That's how you calculate delta E. So, let's say you are here

31:42.360 --> 31:49.080
and I choose this one. What is the change in the energy if I flip it? Be careful

31:51.240 --> 31:52.360
when you calculate this.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.360
Yes?

32:03.560 --> 32:18.600
So, 8j. Do you agree? Yes. So, Metropolis says that we should accept this flip with this probability

32:18.600 --> 32:26.360
minus 8j over kBT, okay? And what if you have something like this?

32:26.680 --> 32:32.920
Something like this. What if you flip this one?

32:36.440 --> 32:37.560
What is the delta E?

32:42.760 --> 32:49.960
Minus 8j. Everybody agrees? It's 4j before, then it's minus 4j. Did you follow?

32:50.840 --> 32:57.160
And according to Metropolis algorithm, if the energy decreases, you accept it.

32:58.520 --> 33:05.800
Okay? So, by doing this, energy decreases accept, energy increases accept with this probability.

33:05.800 --> 33:12.920
If you continue doing this, then you are sampling according to Boltzmann distribution eventually.

33:13.160 --> 33:23.080
Okay? I didn't, I was expecting that this part will take like 10 minutes, but it took 30.

33:24.040 --> 33:32.680
So, I will not explain many details of this code. I hope you can figure it out.

33:32.840 --> 33:43.880
So, by the way, the only possible, by the flips, the only possible energy chains are

33:43.880 --> 33:57.000
minus 8j minus 4j, 0 plus 4j and plus 8j. So, if the energy change is minus 8j,

33:57.000 --> 34:04.680
then there is one probability of switching. If it's minus 4j, one probability. What is, what if

34:05.640 --> 34:14.760
the energy change is 0? Again, one probability because e to the 0 over kBT, right? But the others

34:14.760 --> 34:21.800
will switch with this probability. Okay? Did you follow all this? So, I will start with random

34:22.760 --> 34:32.040
spins, up and downs. And this part, you can see that this is the flip, the spin.

34:34.280 --> 34:41.320
That's all. And just these parts are making sure that you are choosing a random spin,

34:41.320 --> 34:48.040
and according to the probability, you flip it. Did you follow? So, let's run it and see what

34:49.000 --> 35:01.320
we get. We get this interesting structure. I have to point out here that this is not the

35:01.960 --> 35:11.400
real dynamics. Okay? This is not like molecular dynamics. It's just we are sampling the system.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.760
Are you following? Do you agree?

35:22.040 --> 35:23.320
200 by 200.

35:28.280 --> 35:36.360
No, that's a very good point. So, each time this picture changes, we actually flip

35:37.320 --> 35:46.520
200 squared spins. Not at the same time. That's very good. All of those are very good points,

35:46.520 --> 35:54.040
but I have very short time, unfortunately. Can you give me five more minutes after 10.30? Yes?

35:54.600 --> 36:05.560
Okay. So, you are flipping each spin. I mean, you are each time looking at one spin.

36:06.520 --> 36:16.200
And here, I actually do that n squared times, but not necessarily with the same order.

36:17.080 --> 36:23.960
Randomly, I pick n squared times. I pick one spin. Should I flip it or not?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.920
With certain probability, I flip it or not? Did you follow all this?

36:34.520 --> 36:40.040
Sometimes, one spin doesn't get picked at this n squared runs, but that's okay.

36:40.360 --> 36:51.240
Okay. So, let's see. So, right now, KBT is 2. What if I change temperature?

36:53.000 --> 37:04.360
So, let's go to this code. So, here, I will start with 1.5. T minimum is 1.5. I will go to

37:05.320 --> 37:11.240
maximum temperature of 3. Then, I will go back to 1.5. Then, I will go back to 3.

37:11.800 --> 37:17.480
So, I want you to see what happens when the temperature is changed. Okay? Ready?

37:19.800 --> 37:28.680
So, this is low temperature, which means that you have aligned magnets. Do you agree?

37:29.480 --> 37:38.360
Okay? The blue parts are minus spins. So, they are all aligned. You have big magnetization.

37:38.360 --> 37:43.240
Now, we are approaching this critical temperature where you have transition

37:44.280 --> 37:53.400
to from order. This is order and you are going towards disorder. Okay? Where your magnetization

37:53.400 --> 38:07.480
will go down to zero. So, you can see that we have almost equal amount of plus ones and minus ones.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.680
Are you following all this?

38:13.640 --> 38:24.200
Let's... Now, did we reach the maximum temperature? We have reached it

38:25.640 --> 38:32.600
now. Now, we go back. So, what will happen when we go back? Any ideas?

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
Yes?

38:41.320 --> 38:43.320
Yes?

38:46.440 --> 38:53.080
Once you go below critical temperature, you should see the order reappear.

38:54.040 --> 39:06.280
Right? Domains. Very good. So, you will see domains appear and those domains, one of them will dominate.

39:07.160 --> 39:12.360
We don't know which one. So, I think right now my bet is on yellow one.

39:13.640 --> 39:19.080
Right? One of them will dominate and flip the others. No? Blue one?

39:23.400 --> 39:24.920
So, I am taking the bets.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.960
Blue? Yellow. Yellow? Okay.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
No one else?

39:38.600 --> 39:52.840
Yes. Yes, yes. There is a hysteresis and again let me restate.

39:52.920 --> 40:00.920
This is not an actual simulation of a magnet. We are just sampling the system. Are you confused?

40:02.200 --> 40:15.480
No? So, this easy model is not easy to solve at all. Okay? Although the name suggests that way.

40:16.280 --> 40:27.960
So, it was solved by this genius, Lars Onsager. Have you heard of him? Not many people have heard of him.

40:33.480 --> 40:41.160
Yes, critical systems and far from equilibrium systems, right? He got the Nobel Prize in 1968

40:41.160 --> 40:46.120
for this stuff and he actually solved the easing model

40:51.640 --> 40:59.880
analytically. Can you believe it? Genius. So, let's look at that paper.

41:03.080 --> 41:08.520
Two-dimensional model with an older disorder transition. Let's just skip through this

41:09.480 --> 41:19.240
paper and you will see like different mathematics introduced to solve this quaternion algebra.

41:21.400 --> 41:27.160
So, 33 pages of pure beauty. Do you see it?

41:27.400 --> 41:37.960
Well, there's only his name here but let's go to acknowledgments

41:40.120 --> 41:42.440
which is before this long appendix.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.800
Is this still the appendix?

41:48.120 --> 41:50.040
No acknowledgment.

41:53.720 --> 42:06.600
Yes, what is the year? 1943. Right in the middle of the war. He solved this problem.

42:07.160 --> 42:17.800
So, he gave us a very nice formula. Okay? Let's find that formula for critical temperature.

42:18.600 --> 42:24.520
Where the critical temperature occurs? Let's go ahead and find that formula.

42:28.680 --> 42:29.560
Yes, there it is.

42:30.440 --> 42:41.160
So, if you rearrange it, ktc over j should be this weird number 2 over ln 1 plus square root 2.

42:41.720 --> 42:51.800
Okay? And we also have the formula for magnetization. Where is that formula?

42:52.760 --> 42:56.920
So, we have analytical solution.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.880
Never mind. I have this formula in my code.

43:08.200 --> 43:18.360
Let me show you. This is that formula. 1 minus sin hyperbolic 2 times j over kbt

43:19.320 --> 43:25.720
to the power of minus 4 in the brackets to the power of 1 over 8. Never mind.

43:26.360 --> 43:34.200
So, what I will do here, are you following? Yes? What I will do here is I will go from,

43:35.480 --> 43:42.520
so I will define tc to be this number 2 over logarithm 1 plus something. And I will go from

43:42.520 --> 43:50.200
half of the critical temperature to the 1.5 of the critical temperature. Okay? And each time

43:51.560 --> 44:01.000
we will start, we will do how many runs? Let's see. We will do 1000 different runs.

44:02.360 --> 44:10.120
Okay? Each one flipping the spins 200 square times. So,

44:10.120 --> 44:22.200
200 square times 1000 gives you 40 million. Right? So, we will sample 40 million pictures

44:22.200 --> 44:36.760
from the system. Do you agree? And, well, let's run this code. And while it runs, I will talk about it.

44:41.080 --> 44:47.560
So, we have run the first one of this temperature. So, let me...

44:52.520 --> 45:05.160
What we are doing is, this one is t critical. So, we start from 0.5 t critical. And we take the system,

45:05.160 --> 45:17.480
we run the system 1000 times and each time we flip 200 squared spins. But we only take the

45:17.480 --> 45:27.320
last 100 steps and average the magnetization from those pictures. Did you follow? Yes?

45:27.320 --> 45:36.840
What do we expect to get? So, magnetization versus temperature. What would you expect?

45:38.920 --> 45:43.480
Let's say all spins pointing at the same direction is 1.

45:46.120 --> 45:52.760
So, when the temperature is low, it should be very close to 1. Right? Then at this point,

45:53.480 --> 46:04.120
it has to go sharply to 0. Right? And remain at 0 forever. Right? Let's see the result.

46:05.320 --> 46:16.680
There you go. And what is this line? The red line? Yes, analytical solution of metropolis. Do you see

46:16.680 --> 46:25.720
that our numerical calculation using metropolis algorithm is matching it almost perfectly?

46:27.000 --> 46:41.400
Do you have any questions? So, this particular point where it switches will be critical for life.

46:41.400 --> 46:50.520
So, this is where life wants to be, at the criticality. And at least now you have a sense

46:50.520 --> 46:59.160
of order and disorder. Next time we will explore those concepts even further. Do you have any

46:59.160 --> 47:08.920
questions? No? Thank you all. Take care.
