1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,760
Today we will start talking about, so this week, so let me show you this slide, there

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:25,080
you go, one slide, life is critical, okay, so what do we mean by this?

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:34,720
So we talked about the laws of order, right?

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:49,360
Laws of disorder and laws of order, okay, do you remember?

5
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:58,320
Now, I will speculate, and many people did speculate, that life is between order and

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,840
disorder, okay, but how?

7
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,880
So life is at that critical place, life appears at that critical place, because life needs

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:22,680
order to sustain its processes, but life needs disorder to be adaptable to changes, okay?

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:36,120
So today we will look at what physicists mean when they talk about a critical system, disorder

10
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,720
order and the transition between them, phase transition.

11
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:53,240
So I want to start with a method called Monte Carlo method, have you heard of it, yes?

12
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:03,200
You have heard of it, you never tried it, just heard, right?

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,120
Have you heard of the casino, Monte Carlo?

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Yes, so the method takes its name from the casino, okay, which is basically a place where

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:33,120
you throw dice, right, random number, so let's, usually this simple problem is stated for

16
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:44,040
understanding of Monte Carlo, so if I take random numbers between zero and one, okay,

17
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:55,200
random numbers, and then if I count the ones that are inside the unit circle divided by

18
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,800
the total number, what do you expect to get?

19
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:14,400
So pi times one over two squared divided by one squared, pi over four, right?

20
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:31,080
So let's actually do this, and if you throw enough dice, then let's call this set S1,

21
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:40,920
the number of S1 divided by total number will converge to pi over four, right?

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,000
So you can actually take this four to the other side and get an approximation of pi

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,640
as the run continues, right?

24
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,320
So we will not do it smoothly, we will just, okay, how many numbers do you want to, one

25
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:13,880
million, maybe, let me quickly change the font, okay?

26
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:27,240
So random numbers, two rows of random, no, columns, this one is column, right, two columns

27
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,920
of random numbers, right?

28
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,880
So how do you find the ones that are inside a unit circle?

29
00:04:35,880 --> 00:05:02,400
We can do sum of r1 squared plus r2 squared, right, smaller than one, okay?

30
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,560
And divide it by n, multiply it with four, we should get pi, are you ready?

31
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,600
I haven't tried it before, there you go, we get pi to sum, okay, if I do it ten million

32
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:32,240
times, I get a better pi, not that better, yes, there you go, much better pi, right?

33
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,240
Are you with me?

34
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:47,360
Yes, so today we will talk about, so what Monte Carlo did is you throw some dice, you

35
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:59,560
have, you look at the system and you take an average over many trials and you get some

36
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:09,720
physical property, okay, today we will look at a particular case called, I think it's

37
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:25,200
called Ising model, not Ising, so Ising model models magnetization, have you heard of magnetization?

38
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:33,680
You know what the magnet is, yes, have you heard of Curie temperature, yes, what is Curie

39
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:48,920
temperature, again you have heard of it, yes, exactly, so if we have a magnet, let's say

40
00:06:48,920 --> 00:07:00,200
this is T, okay, and this is magnetization, magnetization, like the total strength of

41
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:09,640
the magnet, if you are at zero temperature, okay, then all the tiny magnets are aligned,

42
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,440
so atomic magnets are aligned, so you have maximum magnetization, and as you increase

43
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:25,240
the temperature, those tiny magnets fluctuate, right, and when you reach at the Curie temperature,

44
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:37,840
you lose all magnetization, so zero magnet, so this is the phase transition, so you go

45
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:51,680
from order to disorder, okay, here magnets are aligned, so you have a net magnetization,

46
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:05,360
here they are disordered, do you have any questions so far, no, so we talked about order

47
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:17,600
laws, but we mainly focused on biological kind of order, like pattern formation or something,

48
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,200
there is one law of order that sits right in front of us, which is energy minimization,

49
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:32,680
okay, so if you are at zero temperature, things go to their minimum energy, right,

50
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:42,760
and for example atoms reach their minimum energy by making bonds with other atoms,

51
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,920
and why do we have order, because the atoms are very similar to each other, right, so their

52
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:58,560
environment eventually becomes similar, that's why you make, you form crystals, depending on

53
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,120
the bonding of the atoms, are you following my argument, so if you have carbon atoms,

54
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,960
10 to the 23 of them, each one interacting with the other one in the same fashion, so you expect

55
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:21,480
to get something ordered, because they are all the same, right, but if you increase the temperature,

56
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:33,000
and if those bonds are not strong enough, like in silicon, you get an amorphous material,

57
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:50,200
do you have any questions so far, okay, so what about magnets, this easing model is very simple,

58
00:09:50,760 --> 00:10:01,440
but very rich, so it describes, do you remember this u equals to minus mu dot b,

59
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:11,440
you remember from physics 102, magnetic moments get lower energy when they are aligned with

60
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:30,080
magnetic field, why are you smiling, okay, so now we will look at the case when two magnets interact,

61
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:40,360
in fact we will even simplify it further and we'll assume that these tiny magnets can either have

62
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:56,000
upstate or downstate, do you have any questions so far, so let's call these states S1 and S2 as a vector,

63
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,800
okay, and the energy, the interaction energy between them, if I write it this, in this way,

64
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:14,200
where J is positive, what kind of interaction do they have, do they want to be aligned or

65
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,520
not aligned, do they want to stay opposite to each other or to stay in the same direction,

66
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:37,160
so let's derive, so if both of them is one, okay, like if both of them are aligned, what is the energy

67
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,600
minus J, right, if they are opposite one and minus one, what is the energy

68
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:58,520
plus J, which one is lower energy, minus J, so they want to be aligned, okay, do you have any

69
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:08,680
questions so far, did you miss anything so far, so when this is positive you have a ferromagnetic

70
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:17,160
interaction, ferromagnetic, okay, when J is negative what do you have,

71
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:42,440
no, no, anti-ferromagnetic, thank you all, so you have anti-ferromagnetic state where all

72
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,160
spins want to be opposite, all neighbors want to be opposite to each other, did I draw it

73
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,280
properly, no, so you will have something like this, do you have any questions so far, yes,

74
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,440
this is one big question, how do you know if an object is anti-ferromagnetic, not

75
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,040
nothing else, very good question, that's a very good question,

76
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:32,520
so in the calculation that I do, for example, if I am allowed to switch off the magnetic interaction,

77
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,760
then I see that non-magnetic state has higher energy than anti-ferromagnetic state, did you follow,

78
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:49,480
so I can do calculations using dense function theory, for example, right, so I take a material,

79
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:59,160
I do a non-magnetic calculation, I get an energy value E1, then I do a magnetic calculation,

80
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,080
magnetic interaction is on, okay, but I see zero magnetization

81
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,520
at the end of the calculation, but I see that E2 is smaller than E1,

82
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,480
but how about experiments, right, what would you see in experiments,

83
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,640
I don't know, okay, but did you get a gist of an answer here,

84
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,200
yes, I hope so,

85
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,920
that's a very good approach,

86
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,200
so you can see the dynamics of the system with respect to applied magnetic field,

87
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,160
you are not happy,

88
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:19,000
I think so, like, first of all, this one will not get magnetized at all, I guess,

89
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,360
so this one, the non-magnetic material would not interact with magnetic field,

90
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:41,160
because its spins are all fulfilled, they are dream, they have all found their peers,

91
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,360
well we are at the edge of my knowledge, so let's,

92
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:59,480
this is embarrassing, but I don't know, I don't have a good answer, so let's move on,

93
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,400
so we will look at ferromagnetic case,

94
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:18,760
where you expect all spins to be aligned eventually at zero Kelvin, right, so let's look at,

95
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,480
I'm sorry, can I ask you a question,

96
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,880
about the alignment of course,

97
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,880
so is it like something one dimension, could they all be facing the same way,

98
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,640
I mean like are we defining how it is like, they are either facing the same direction,

99
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,040
or they are not, but not specific like this, or could there be something like this,

100
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,440
okay, so is it one dimension,

101
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:06,840
in our model, there are only two states, like on and off, okay, but normally there are these things

102
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:16,440
called magnons, like phonons, photons, electrons, they are magnons, that corresponds to

103
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,200
this kind of

104
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,520
oscillation, like let's say they are all aligned, but you introduce

105
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,680
just like in the atoms, when they are at their equilibrium,

106
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:46,520
if you, what, yes, precession, yes, very good, so if you just disturb this atom,

107
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:54,200
it will create a wave, right, and we call them phonons, okay, in the similar fashion,

108
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:03,640
if you have like perfectly aligned magnetic moments, and then you process one of them,

109
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,800
and that interacts with the other, processes the other, and you create a wave that acts

110
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:18,040
as a particle called magnon, yes, yes, and

111
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:31,880
this is again, I don't want to go into too much discussion, but have you heard of quantum mechanics?

112
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:44,600
Yes, so there weird things happen, like if you are measuring spin of an electron

113
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,600
in a certain direction, you either get plus one over two or minus one over two,

114
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:02,040
although they could have been, I mean, quantum mechanically, when you operate on something,

115
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:13,800
it just goes to one of its eigenvalues, so it's not far away from the truth,

116
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:27,880
this interaction, thank you, so let's think of four spins, okay, just four spins,

117
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,000
so how much energy do we have here in total?

118
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:49,720
Go ahead, don't be scared, minus 4j, just four spins,

119
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,840
yes, like this interaction, this interaction, this and this, we don't have this interaction,

120
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:12,840
okay, do you have any questions so far? No, so let's look at another state where this

121
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,800
is present, so what is the total energy here?

122
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:26,120
Minus 2j, very good, right, so what about

123
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,320
is it?

124
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:45,800
Zero, I trust you, so minus minus plus plus, you're right, so what about this one?

125
00:20:48,200 --> 00:21:00,840
What is the check plus 4j? Plus 4j, okay, so remember Boltzmann distribution,

126
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:11,080
do you remember it? This is the probability of a certain state, KBT, do you remember this?

127
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,880
So, if you are at a certain temperature, let's say you are at a certain temperature,

128
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:26,280
the probability of having this state is e to the minus 4j over KBT, I mean,

129
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,080
if you want to find the probability, you need to sum all other probabilities, right,

130
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,960
plus for example, this one is e to the zero KBT

131
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,080
and e to the 4j over KBT, do you understand what I'm doing?

132
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,360
So, let's say this is the total probabilities, this is the probability of this one happening,

133
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:04,920
so it's very small, right, compared to others, this is more probable and this is the most probable,

134
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:12,520
actually, in fact, if you go to zero temperature, this will be infinitely more probable than the

135
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:19,400
other, so it will be the only possibility and it will go there, did you follow so far the discussion,

136
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,560
yes? So, what we are going to do is we are going to simulate

137
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:37,320
any configuration of spins at a certain temperature, okay, at a certain temperature.

138
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:45,080
So, how do we do this? How will we do this and how it will connect to Monte Carlo method?

139
00:22:46,040 --> 00:23:01,720
Well, there we have Nicholas Metropolis, okay, from Los Alamos, by the way, I want to point out Los Alamos guys,

140
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:14,760
okay, they built the A-bomb, that's a different story, but Los Alamos brought so many brilliant

141
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:24,200
people, right, let's just name them Feynman von Neumann, right, Metropolis, Fermi, who else?

142
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:38,440
Ulam, definitely, and many others, right, and Feigenbaum, by the way, Los Alamos, so some,

143
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:47,960
and generally numerically interesting thing came out of there, because that was the place

144
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,720
where computers were used massively for the first time, I guess, right, to calculate the effect of

145
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:06,840
the explosion, you agree? So, let's just look at Metropolis's Magnum Opus,

146
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:19,320
the greatest work of Metropolis, where is it? Just if we type Nicholas Metropolis

147
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,360
and maybe Metropolis Monte Carlo,

148
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,720
it's not, no?

149
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,720
I wanted to show you the citations, it's more than, it's around 7,000,

150
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,560
but I will show you the paper, never mind, so this is the paper,

151
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,920
equation of state calculation by fast computing machines, like iPhones,

152
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:15,400
okay, so, this is, is this the part where the sublime part, yes,

153
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,280
we then calculate the change in energy of the system, delta E, which is caused by the move,

154
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,720
if delta E is smaller than zero, if the move would bring the system to a lower state energy,

155
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,000
we allow the move and put the particle in its new position, I will explain this, but

156
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,160
let's read it first from the original, if delta E is bigger than zero, we allow the move with the

157
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:55,800
probability of this one, E to the minus delta E KBT, so here,

158
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,360
I will tell you something more from this,

159
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:12,200
let me find that word, those words,

160
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:29,560
it will be worth it, just let me find,

161
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,680
okay, never mind, so,

162
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:46,360
I had some point here, let me make that point, and everything will be clear, I promise you, okay,

163
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,600
so how would you calculate magnetization in this system?

164
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:04,200
Let's say you put four spins into a temperature of some T, and you want to

165
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,880
find the total magnetization, how would you calculate it?

166
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:23,560
Well, I'm talking about this simple system that has, so what you are going to do is,

167
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:31,000
for all possibilities, you have the energies, right, and those energies will give you the

168
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,880
probabilities, do you agree? So, what is this total magnetization in this system?

169
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:50,920
Four, right, if it's one plus one plus one, it's four, so can I do the following? I integrate

170
00:27:50,920 --> 00:28:01,480
over all possible states the probability of being at that energy times the magnetization

171
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:16,360
at that energy, yes, yes, it's the expectation of magnetization, did you follow this? Yes,

172
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:24,360
so what we did is, we look at, we sampled the whole system, then we took the possibilities,

173
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:33,480
and we multiplied them to find the average. Metropolis Monte Carlo approaches it a different

174
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:47,960
way, okay, it samples with that probability, then it takes the average. So, let me restate this,

175
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:58,760
in this case, we take all possibilities, multiply them with their probabilities,

176
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:09,160
then sum them up, right, then average them out. In the metropolis case, you choose,

177
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:21,080
you already choose the systems with the relevant probabilities, and then you average them out.

178
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,640
Maybe, who can explain what I just told you?

179
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,040
Yes, that's the bad version, yes, so what is the good version?

180
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,440
The good version, they just take the, not the all the probability, but just take some of those,

181
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,360
and at the end of the day, you can get all the probabilities, right?

182
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:10,520
You take the states according to their probability already, you sample them according to their

183
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:16,600
probability, then you take those samples and you take the average. If I could find that sentence,

184
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:24,440
it's much better put in Metropolis's paper, please go ahead and read it and find that sentence.

185
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:40,600
So, let me restate it one final time. Instead of taking all possible states and averaging them

186
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:47,560
according to their probabilities, we take the states according to their probabilities and

187
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,960
average them out. The number of states in the first case is, the number of states, I think,

188
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:03,480
no, that's the whole point. The number in the first case, I have to take all numbers,

189
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,880
everything, everything that is possible.

190
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:19,320
Let me tell you what what I take. So, Metropolis algorithm tells you that you should take them

191
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:30,920
in the following way. So, let's say you pick one single spin and you calculate what happens if you

192
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:39,640
flip it, okay? That's how you calculate delta E. So, let's say you are here

193
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:49,080
and I choose this one. What is the change in the energy if I flip it? Be careful

194
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,360
when you calculate this.

195
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,360
Yes?

196
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:18,600
So, 8j. Do you agree? Yes. So, Metropolis says that we should accept this flip with this probability

197
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:26,360
minus 8j over kBT, okay? And what if you have something like this?

198
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,920
Something like this. What if you flip this one?

199
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,560
What is the delta E?

200
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:49,960
Minus 8j. Everybody agrees? It's 4j before, then it's minus 4j. Did you follow?

201
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,160
And according to Metropolis algorithm, if the energy decreases, you accept it.

202
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:05,800
Okay? So, by doing this, energy decreases accept, energy increases accept with this probability.

203
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,920
If you continue doing this, then you are sampling according to Boltzmann distribution eventually.

204
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:23,080
Okay? I didn't, I was expecting that this part will take like 10 minutes, but it took 30.

205
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:32,680
So, I will not explain many details of this code. I hope you can figure it out.

206
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:43,880
So, by the way, the only possible, by the flips, the only possible energy chains are

207
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:57,000
minus 8j minus 4j, 0 plus 4j and plus 8j. So, if the energy change is minus 8j,

208
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,680
then there is one probability of switching. If it's minus 4j, one probability. What is, what if

209
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:14,760
the energy change is 0? Again, one probability because e to the 0 over kBT, right? But the others

210
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,800
will switch with this probability. Okay? Did you follow all this? So, I will start with random

211
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:32,040
spins, up and downs. And this part, you can see that this is the flip, the spin.

212
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:41,320
That's all. And just these parts are making sure that you are choosing a random spin,

213
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:48,040
and according to the probability, you flip it. Did you follow? So, let's run it and see what

214
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:01,320
we get. We get this interesting structure. I have to point out here that this is not the

215
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:11,400
real dynamics. Okay? This is not like molecular dynamics. It's just we are sampling the system.

216
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,760
Are you following? Do you agree?

217
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,320
200 by 200.

218
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:36,360
No, that's a very good point. So, each time this picture changes, we actually flip

219
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:46,520
200 squared spins. Not at the same time. That's very good. All of those are very good points,

220
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:54,040
but I have very short time, unfortunately. Can you give me five more minutes after 10.30? Yes?

221
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:05,560
Okay. So, you are flipping each spin. I mean, you are each time looking at one spin.

222
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:16,200
And here, I actually do that n squared times, but not necessarily with the same order.

223
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,960
Randomly, I pick n squared times. I pick one spin. Should I flip it or not?

224
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,920
With certain probability, I flip it or not? Did you follow all this?

225
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:40,040
Sometimes, one spin doesn't get picked at this n squared runs, but that's okay.

226
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:51,240
Okay. So, let's see. So, right now, KBT is 2. What if I change temperature?

227
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:04,360
So, let's go to this code. So, here, I will start with 1.5. T minimum is 1.5. I will go to

228
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,240
maximum temperature of 3. Then, I will go back to 1.5. Then, I will go back to 3.

229
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,480
So, I want you to see what happens when the temperature is changed. Okay? Ready?

230
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:28,680
So, this is low temperature, which means that you have aligned magnets. Do you agree?

231
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:38,360
Okay? The blue parts are minus spins. So, they are all aligned. You have big magnetization.

232
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,240
Now, we are approaching this critical temperature where you have transition

233
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:53,400
to from order. This is order and you are going towards disorder. Okay? Where your magnetization

234
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:07,480
will go down to zero. So, you can see that we have almost equal amount of plus ones and minus ones.

235
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,680
Are you following all this?

236
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:24,200
Let's... Now, did we reach the maximum temperature? We have reached it

237
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:32,600
now. Now, we go back. So, what will happen when we go back? Any ideas?

238
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Yes?

239
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Yes?

240
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,080
Once you go below critical temperature, you should see the order reappear.

241
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:06,280
Right? Domains. Very good. So, you will see domains appear and those domains, one of them will dominate.

242
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,360
We don't know which one. So, I think right now my bet is on yellow one.

243
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,080
Right? One of them will dominate and flip the others. No? Blue one?

244
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,920
So, I am taking the bets.

245
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,960
Blue? Yellow. Yellow? Okay.

246
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
No one else?

247
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:52,840
Yes. Yes, yes. There is a hysteresis and again let me restate.

248
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:00,920
This is not an actual simulation of a magnet. We are just sampling the system. Are you confused?

249
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:15,480
No? So, this easy model is not easy to solve at all. Okay? Although the name suggests that way.

250
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:27,960
So, it was solved by this genius, Lars Onsager. Have you heard of him? Not many people have heard of him.

251
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:41,160
Yes, critical systems and far from equilibrium systems, right? He got the Nobel Prize in 1968

252
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,120
for this stuff and he actually solved the easing model

253
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:59,880
analytically. Can you believe it? Genius. So, let's look at that paper.

254
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:08,520
Two-dimensional model with an older disorder transition. Let's just skip through this

255
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:19,240
paper and you will see like different mathematics introduced to solve this quaternion algebra.

256
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,160
So, 33 pages of pure beauty. Do you see it?

257
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:37,960
Well, there's only his name here but let's go to acknowledgments

258
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,440
which is before this long appendix.

259
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,800
Is this still the appendix?

260
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,040
No acknowledgment.

261
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:06,600
Yes, what is the year? 1943. Right in the middle of the war. He solved this problem.

262
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:17,800
So, he gave us a very nice formula. Okay? Let's find that formula for critical temperature.

263
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,520
Where the critical temperature occurs? Let's go ahead and find that formula.

264
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,560
Yes, there it is.

265
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:41,160
So, if you rearrange it, ktc over j should be this weird number 2 over ln 1 plus square root 2.

266
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:51,800
Okay? And we also have the formula for magnetization. Where is that formula?

267
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,920
So, we have analytical solution.

268
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,880
Never mind. I have this formula in my code.

269
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:18,360
Let me show you. This is that formula. 1 minus sin hyperbolic 2 times j over kbt

270
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:25,720
to the power of minus 4 in the brackets to the power of 1 over 8. Never mind.

271
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:34,200
So, what I will do here, are you following? Yes? What I will do here is I will go from,

272
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:42,520
so I will define tc to be this number 2 over logarithm 1 plus something. And I will go from

273
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:50,200
half of the critical temperature to the 1.5 of the critical temperature. Okay? And each time

274
00:43:51,560 --> 00:44:01,000
we will start, we will do how many runs? Let's see. We will do 1000 different runs.

275
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:10,120
Okay? Each one flipping the spins 200 square times. So,

276
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:22,200
200 square times 1000 gives you 40 million. Right? So, we will sample 40 million pictures

277
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:36,760
from the system. Do you agree? And, well, let's run this code. And while it runs, I will talk about it.

278
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:47,560
So, we have run the first one of this temperature. So, let me...

279
00:44:52,520 --> 00:45:05,160
What we are doing is, this one is t critical. So, we start from 0.5 t critical. And we take the system,

280
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:17,480
we run the system 1000 times and each time we flip 200 squared spins. But we only take the

281
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:27,320
last 100 steps and average the magnetization from those pictures. Did you follow? Yes?

282
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:36,840
What do we expect to get? So, magnetization versus temperature. What would you expect?

283
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,480
Let's say all spins pointing at the same direction is 1.

284
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:52,760
So, when the temperature is low, it should be very close to 1. Right? Then at this point,

285
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:04,120
it has to go sharply to 0. Right? And remain at 0 forever. Right? Let's see the result.

286
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:16,680
There you go. And what is this line? The red line? Yes, analytical solution of metropolis. Do you see

287
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:25,720
that our numerical calculation using metropolis algorithm is matching it almost perfectly?

288
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:41,400
Do you have any questions? So, this particular point where it switches will be critical for life.

289
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:50,520
So, this is where life wants to be, at the criticality. And at least now you have a sense

290
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:59,160
of order and disorder. Next time we will explore those concepts even further. Do you have any

291
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:08,920
questions? No? Thank you all. Take care.
