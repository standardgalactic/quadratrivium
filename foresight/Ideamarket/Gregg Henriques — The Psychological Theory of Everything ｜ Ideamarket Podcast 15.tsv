0	20000	Welcome everyone once again to the idea market podcast joined with by Mike Elias, the CEO, and we are joined by psychologist sort of extraordinaire Greg Henriquez and we're going to be talking about the unified theory of knowledge.
21000	40000	The unified theory of psychology and sort of the four principles that Greg you've come up with around this, which all have these sort of seemingly complicated names on the on the outside but it all coheres into this sort of quite quite a beautiful and extremely radical and I would say brave vision but before we
40000	56000	get into any of that we have a sort of introductory question unique to this podcast which instead of the tell us a little bit about yourself we like to ask if you were to design a course Greg and the purpose of which is everyone who completes the course becomes a clone of you.
56000	60000	What would that course look like.
60000	65000	Ah, beautiful. In fact, I'm outlining such a course.
65000	68000	It's a entry into the garden.
68000	88000	So essentially behind me is a depiction of the garden which is captures sort of in weird cartoon, sincere ironic form to use a meta modern term for anybody that knows that a way to organize a number of different pieces and then you would learn the overall first principles.
88000	93000	And then you would enter into it and then learn the parts and then learn to sync up those parts.
93000	104000	Apply them to yourself and the situation you find yourself in developmentally historically relationship to future and then cultivate a new coherent integrated pluralistic set of understanding.
104000	113000	That turns our chaotic fragmented pluralism into a way to achieve a lot more harmony and coherent integration for the soul and spirit.
113000	120000	So everyone would would end up the same but that sameness allows them to become themselves.
120000	138000	Right, definitely not. I mean you each of us is a unique ideographic psyche. Okay, so that's actually what this little coin represents it's one but it's the one openness to be the unique particular historical contingent being that you are and no one else.
138000	157000	At the same time we want to create a dialectic between our uniqueness and the particular world in which we occupy and view, and the general unifying principles that tie us all together in one this so that we achieve a one this separateness dialectic multiplicity unity dialect.
157000	159000	Okay.
159000	164000	I have to jump in real quick as I heard a phrase that really piqued my interest in there.
164000	184000	You said, Idiographic psyche. I've heard the term idiographic applied to linguistic things like they say Chinese uses idiograms or is idiographic because it has like these visual elements, and also that instead of sort of codifying exactly what is meant.
184000	199000	There's with it a weight of context that has a lot of layers and depth to it. I'm interested to know if, if your use of idiographic psyche in this sense has some similarities or relations to that I just love for for you to do like a bit more of exploration on that term.
199000	201000	Absolutely.
201000	212000	Yes, I think there's connection but if they're in a dictionary they're using a slightly different term, meaning of it, the dictionary definition that I'm using will be the opposite of no mancetic.
212000	222000	And no mancetic refers to general laws and principles gravity is a great no mancetic principle about retraction that then is about as generalizable as it gets.
222000	238000	Science is delineating generalizable no mancetic principles that then afford us the capacity to understand from an exterior, if you want to use that view epistemology, oh what are the laws or habits of nature that are generalizable and no mancetic that
238000	251000	generate causal explanatory frames in contrast to the no mancetic is the specific unique historical contingent, idiographic specific real.
251000	269000	So in other words, that's the actual event, as it were, with all of its contingent particular uniqueness. One of the things that's really interesting about psychology, depending on how you look at it, is that you can think about all that unique particular
269000	278000	specific unreliable true to you but not valid and reliable in any generalizable way from a scientific perspective as error.
278000	289000	So if you know science is like oh well there's a lot of error, but our laws sort of work because we can count for variance but then there's left over error that has to do with the unique particular historical contingent,
289000	293000	idiographic mix of variables that we really can't explain.
293000	302000	Okay, from the vantage point of me, virtually everything that matters in my life is from the vantage point of science.
302000	316000	So one of the cool things we got to figure out is what's the relationship between the specific, this is the humanistic scientific debate in psychology, what's the relationship to my specific unique experience of being as an individual.
316000	321000	And what are the generalizable realities that say oh well I'm a human primate.
321000	329000	I'm a weird white male that's wandering around with my particular cultural identities and doing all of those things at a more generalizable level.
329000	337000	Part of the Utah system provides a pretty clear way to place those frames in proper relation.
337000	355000	Would it be fair to describe the difference between nomenthetic, which is a word I've never heard before, and specific real idiographic unique as the nomenthetic is like the linear that which can be represented.
355000	373000	And the specific real is the the nonlinear the immediate that every moment in circumstances is completely unique in history you can't step in the same river twice, and therefore requires a certain immediate sensitivity that mere adherence to the
374000	377000	is that kind of the dichotomy.
377000	394000	Totally, although I wouldn't use exactly the word linear per se, but I would certainly say that all of what you said about the idea of graphic and then it's contrast to what might be the more general quasi linear because all science really certainly you can develop complex adaptive nonlinear
395000	409000	frames on the unfolding of causation in fact virtually all sophisticated scientific frames are generalizable principles of especially calm, you know when we get into complex adaptive systems complexity chaos theory, all of that tells us, you know, our scientific understanding
410000	425000	include nonlinear dynamic systems from the outside. So I would, I would hesitate to say that those can be very nomenthetic notions, although we apply the nomenthetic notions to the chaos and complexity what you realize is your predictability is essentially impossible.
425000	434000	In terms of outcome, that's what you learn in relationship to that in you talk, essentially the way it works is there's the tree of knowledge system.
434000	450000	Okay, which is the upside down cones of energy starts it and then matter life mind and culture, which is this new map of big history, basically, and then the new map of big history is a vision of the nomenthetic frames of the generalizable causal
450000	469000	planetary unfolding of the wave of causality. So in that system, I am a particular kind of cultured mental living creature that operates on justification and investment and my living organismic history that the scientific lens would see me as an unfolding
469000	479000	wave of behavior across those different lenses. Okay, and then you flip that in relationship to this thing called a coin, which you can't really see here but basically it's a symbol.
479000	490000	Okay, I quad coin and what it is is it's really the simplest way to think about it as a mirror for your inner consciousness in its particular moment.
490000	503000	Okay, so I would look at this and now Oh, this is Greg Henrikas with all the unique felt experiences being the qualitative experiences of being from the first person in the real that science basically obliterates.
503000	512000	Okay, so scientific knowledge, basically decided that first person idiographic contingent quality is not important.
513000	527000	We can't really see it. We can't really map it. And so we're going to map everything around it and then hope that it's just epiphenomenal and doesn't fucking matter. But they actually asked out the variable and then decided it wouldn't matter, which is kind of unfair.
527000	533000	And it's, it's idiographic. The, the, the, the judgment call is an, is an idiographic unique.
534000	547000	People get together, say we don't fucking want this idiographic variable. So you know, you don't want to do that. You got to get that variable back in there and you have to understand that you factored it out first, contextualize it and then put it back in and that's what people couldn't figure out how to do.
547000	559000	So the humanist and psychology said, fuck you, you guys, you guys exit out. It's not fair. It's clearly real. We have to attend it. The, you know, natural science psychologist said, Oh, we'll figure it out or you have to do all this and blah, blah, blah.
559000	570000	And the science humanistic split now, you know, there's no system that afforded capacity get to psyche and behavior in proper relation. You talk is about doing that in part.
570000	584000	Awesome. I can't, I can't wait to, to go more into that, but I just, I want to jam a little bit more on this distinction because I think it's one that'll be familiar to people from other contexts.
584000	601000	Like when, when we're talking about this distinction, I'm, I'm most recently reminded now of the, I guess sort of Taoist distinction between masculine and feminine, you have masculine frame structure, emptiness, timelessness.
601000	619000	And then you have feminine perpetual change variety form, you know, form versus function. And you know, these divisions have this same kind of entanglement that you're just, you know, described. So I'm just, I'm just trying to help help people who might have more of that background.
619000	620000	Sure.
620000	626000	Use it to link into your frameworks here. So I just think that's really cool that you've synthesized all this in a new way.
626000	642000	Yeah, I mean, so I love that love that reference. We definitely need to shift from some of our Western dichotomized thinking, especially dichotomized thinking that's like broken dichotomies that we can't get put back together most common mind body kinds of problems.
642000	660000	Okay. And dialectical thinking that puts certain kinds of polarity energies in proper relation and perspectival positions in proper relation and recognize that it's, it's this and this and it's the whole in relation that affords the proper framing and we just haven't figured out how to do that.
660000	679000	And really with the enlightenment when they built sort of objectivist third person science for matter in motion. One of the things they set in motion is this matter mind dichotomy or mind body problem dichotomy that we just haven't been figuring out how to, you know, recognize and undo and redo so that we get the proper.
680000	683000	Well, positions in relation of psyche and physics.
683000	694000	So Greg, when I was one thing I do really want to bring in because it just fascinated me when you were talking about it when I was doing the research for this, watching a few of your talks and read your read your book.
695000	705000	As I was reading it I was getting the same feeling I get what you used to get when I read young right so it's all this very often quite structured but then you have this feeling of like this.
705000	717000	There's something a bit more mystical or something a bit more strange behind all this and then I watch your talks and I know you've spoken about this a few more times on other podcasts, but I would like for you to perhaps tell if you if you want to.
717000	730000	How you came across this theory because it's not exactly how you know it's not like you sat down one day and just as down something you called it sort of the the event or something something along those lines.
730000	748000	Well, right there was there was the TOK flash, the tree of knowledge flash that really basically launched me into a fucking totally weird dimension of understanding that happened tonight so essentially the stories this in a nutshell happy to go whatever detail, but I anybody's
749000	759000	Anyway, I'm a trained as a regular behavioral scientist psychologist okay when you get trained as a behavioral scientific psychologist you say oh everyone's out there doing folk psychology.
759000	766000	Hey, that's what you do when you deal with your wife and your problems and blah blah blah and you get all neurotic and you make sense out of shit you're this and that blah blah blah.
766000	777000	And then we built this thing called science, which is a particular method and then the science has real critical questions and we can get the truth through the methods of science, and then I learned all the behavioral methods of science, which are super important.
777000	786000	And then you apply them to psychology and you're supposed to exact extract these general truths and I bought that that's what psychology did, and but I also want to become a clinician.
786000	791000	So then I go and I do psychotherapy, okay, start learning psychotherapy.
791000	799000	And then we actually individually with a real person in real contact, all that shit that you read studies about feels pretty fucking distant, you know it's like hmm.
799000	807000	And then you watch all the best of the best from the various approaches they get really good outcomes and the shitty people from the shitty from the same approaches get lousy outcomes.
807000	821000	You actually learn the science is really they all basically get the same outcomes minus a few CBT cognitive behavior therapy is out there trying to promote but it's basically just propaganda trying to promote this the way to get the truth and turns out that's bullshit.
821000	829000	And so then you're like actually there's all these key insights that that are if you know Wilbur at all Ken Wilbur it's like a partial and truth position.
829000	830000	Okay.
830000	836000	And then I'm like, why are we doing these different schools of thought like CBT psychodynamic family systems.
836000	843000	Why don't we take the science of human psychology and apply it and organize the field that way shouldn't that's what medicine sort of does.
843000	844000	Okay.
844000	850000	Well this gets me into what's called the problem first of psychotherapy and then the problem of psychology, like what the fuck is psychology.
850000	853000	And that's where I rose. Oh my god, we actually don't know that at all.
853000	858000	And that's an amazing thing that people should know that we have no idea what the word psychology means.
858000	863000	In fact, I will tell you do you have a do you have a provisional idea like what's your opinion. Yeah.
863000	864000	Yeah, I know.
864000	866000	Oh, goodness.
866000	871000	But you should everyone on this podcast should know that psychology got started.
871000	873000	It grew into lots of different things.
873000	880000	And by the 1920s folks that's 100 years from now ago, everyone agreed that we didn't know what it meant.
880000	884000	And we would then decided that we would never know what it meant.
884000	893000	That field is in complete agreement that it doesn't know what it means and is in complete agreement that it can never know what it means.
893000	897000	They don't teach you that, but I can show you as a scholar that that's exactly the case.
897000	904000	It's actually called the crisis in psychology. Historically, it's the fact that there are all these different reference that nobody agrees.
904000	909000	And there's no way to put them together and you come to the conclusion that you never can.
909000	916000	And then what they do is they will solve the problem through methodological science rather than knowledge.
916000	921000	So we're going to apply the methods of science. That's why, by the way, it's the science of behavior and mental process.
921000	924000	Behavior is pulled out methodologically by the science.
924000	928000	And then everybody gets to bush it about what they mean by mental process.
928000	930000	And then it all depends on your mid level model.
930000	934000	And so they built a proliferation of mid level models of really interesting shit.
934000	938000	All of which are contingently defined by an idiographic fucking researcher.
938000	943000	That can't be nominatically put together as we're arguing they're doing a nominatic game.
943000	947000	I mean, it's unbelievable when you actually get inside of it. It's a complete blind fuck.
947000	950000	And so there's a thing called a problem of psychology. It's a crisis.
950000	956000	It's way more important than quantum gravity. It's way more important than quantum gravity.
956000	959000	And we've known about it for 100 years and nobody cares.
959000	963000	It drives me insane. I mean, it's like I live it. I wake up every day in Alice in Wonderland.
963000	967000	It's like, everyone knows this. It's super important and no one cares.
967000	971000	Okay. It's bizarre, you know. But anyway, I found out about it.
971000	975000	I backed into it because I had to do psychotherapy. I want to do it from a scientific perspective.
975000	979000	You don't do that based on studies. You basically do that on understanding.
979000	983000	A nominatic generalizable understanding of human mental behavior is what we want.
983000	988000	So that I can use a general nominatic understanding and place the unique and theographic psyche
988000	993000	who I'm treating in psychological doctor terms with a generalized understanding
993000	997000	and then create the proper relation between my scientific generalized understanding
997000	1001000	and the ideographic psyche. That's what I wanted. And there's nothing like that.
1001000	1006000	Well, until I built it. Okay. So anyway, I drop into this, get the problem of psychotherapy,
1006000	1010000	stumble into the problem of psychology. I didn't really even know how. This is 1996.
1010000	1014000	So, and I'm building this. I go drop into what's called evolutionary psychology.
1014000	1018000	Okay, because actually cutting actually the biology and then that can actually chemistry and physics
1018000	1022000	and you get into the natural sciences. And that is by the way, I believe psychology to be coherent
1022000	1026000	has to be coherently anchored to the natural sciences. Okay.
1026000	1029000	But this is the big problem. How do you get from natural science to a psyche, ideographic,
1029000	1032000	subjective conscious experience? No one could do that.
1032000	1036000	So anyway, I have one key insight, which is the first thing that launched me.
1036000	1040000	It's called justification systems theory. And the short version of it is this.
1040000	1044000	Hey, we are primates at one point, a lot like the rest of the great apes.
1044000	1049000	And over first a 500,000 to then a 50,000 year period, we go from great eight like behavior
1049000	1054000	for really five million years into hunter-gatherers that are really synced up with each other.
1054000	1058000	And then all of a sudden we fucking start talking and then we build culture.
1058000	1063000	Okay. And then over the last 50,000 culture, our justification systems is the technical term
1063000	1068000	and our technology totally explode. And then we behave like no other animal on earth.
1068000	1071000	Okay. Over the last 50,000 to 100,000 years.
1071000	1077000	Well, I figured out I landed on an idea that the core of the ideological structure is this thing called
1078000	1081000	the problem of justification, which happens with propositional language.
1081000	1085000	And then you start talking and then you ask question answer dynamics and question answer
1085000	1087000	dynamics give rise to the problem of justification.
1087000	1091000	And that then drives the evolution of an ego, a persona and a culture,
1091000	1094000	which is like, Hey, I got to justify to myself. I got to justify to you.
1094000	1099000	And we all got to collectively get together and decide what is and ought is on the propositional language.
1099000	1104000	And then actually culture explodes out of primate world through this emergence,
1104000	1108000	capital C culture. And then we build technologies because our collective intelligence grows
1108000	1112000	tremendously. And then that builds on itself and boom, you get the explosion.
1112000	1117000	So I saw that in 1996. Okay. Late 1996 changed my I'm all of a sudden I'm like,
1117000	1120000	Oh my God, I'm a justifying eight. That's what I am.
1120000	1122000	You know, not a possible problems or even reason.
1122000	1126000	It's our collective capacity come together and justify justify ourselves to ourselves,
1126000	1130000	sells to each other and collectively each other in relationship to the world.
1130000	1132000	All right. Now it's going to be my life.
1132000	1134000	I was like, Oh my God, I figure this thing out.
1134000	1136000	I'm really important, blah, blah, blah.
1136000	1139000	And then one night I'm stoned in 1997. Okay.
1139000	1143000	I'm just like, and because I developed what now becomes joint points.
1143000	1145000	So I developed a joint point.
1145000	1151000	That's a causal explanatory framework that took me from a primate to a culture person plane of existence.
1151000	1158000	And then I could see clearly I differentiated technology and I could see the collective cultural ideological evolution of these
1158000	1162000	networks, the social construction of knowledge is what it's a theory of.
1162000	1165000	Okay. It's like, why do we get together and construct knowledge and how it's like,
1165000	1168000	Okay, I've got this separation about the, if you want to do it in scientific terms,
1168000	1171000	I have a variance accounted for. Okay.
1171000	1176000	In relationship to the generalized human relative to the rest of the animal kingdom.
1176000	1178000	And I'm now networking that out.
1178000	1181000	All right. So I'm stoned one day and I'm like, well, okay, well, how do we get there?
1181000	1185000	And I had the original drawing and I basically draw a circle for big bang.
1185000	1189000	And then I was like, well, there's one cone through one cone, one, another cone.
1189000	1192000	That's one cone comes matter. So matter pops out energy.
1192000	1195000	And the cone was upside down cone through that.
1195000	1197000	And then, oh, life pops out of matter.
1197000	1199000	And then animal mind pops out of life.
1199000	1202000	And then persons pop out of animal mind.
1202000	1204000	Okay.
1204000	1208000	I fucking drew that thing out and was like, boom, my life changed.
1208000	1210000	This is unbelievable.
1210000	1214000	I saw those cones in every bit of my cells, which that's why I kept the damn drawing.
1214000	1219000	And I was like, oh my God, that's like a map of everything.
1219000	1221000	Right there.
1221000	1226000	It's a five different sets of variants that I now can actually conceptually organize energy.
1226000	1231000	Energy really, I'll call it the energy information and put good order technically, but just call it energy.
1231000	1237000	And then matter comes out of that and life comes out of that and mind animal mind.
1237000	1238000	We get that all screwed.
1238000	1241000	It's animal mind comes out of that and culture persons come out of that.
1241000	1248000	And guess what science is a form of cultural justification that circles back and that's the whole goddamn thing.
1248000	1249000	All right.
1249000	1252000	So now I had this unbelievably simple map.
1252000	1261000	Okay, of the universe that actually made sense and put energy and matter in relationship to psyche and then science, all in a coherent picture.
1261000	1266000	And to talk about a mind fuck, I was then like, oh my God, I found out this formula.
1266000	1267000	Okay, unbelievable.
1267000	1275000	And the early diagrams I have, I kept from everybody and I have little things on there says, please do not use and reproduce without permission.
1275000	1279000	Because the phenomenological experience of me was I was like looking at a car outside.
1279000	1280000	It wasn't complicated.
1280000	1281000	My phenomenology.
1281000	1284000	So I looked at this map and I'm like, oh my God, it's the map of the universe.
1284000	1285000	And nobody else has had this.
1285000	1289000	And I just figured it out in a stone weird night in August 1997.
1289000	1292000	And then I was like, I wouldn't anyone actually see this.
1292000	1294000	They could actually steal this thing.
1294000	1299000	You know, so I mean, literally for a year, I fucking hit the thing thinking that other people.
1299000	1306000	And then I was like, I tried to contact, you know, the leading thinkers at Harvard, you know, Steve Pinker and E. O. Wilson, E. O. Wilson produced conciliants.
1306000	1311000	And I'm like capping on Dan, Dan, guys, guys, a little postdoc over here or not.
1311000	1312000	I even I was a doc soon.
1312000	1314000	I was like, oh, I figured this shit out.
1314000	1317000	Guess what they're like, oh, you know, Dan, Dan wrote back one word to my little email.
1317000	1319000	I was like, are you surprising?
1319000	1321000	But yeah, right, Dan.
1321000	1323000	Anyway, whatever.
1323000	1325000	Then I realized I couldn't give the goddamn thing away.
1325000	1337000	And that was a weird thing, weird thing, you know, you realize you actually and the institutional structure and its own embeddedness was essentially fundamentally already blind to the potential insight.
1337000	1344000	And then it's already justified that why this was either common sense that everybody already knew or some crazy set of ideas that couldn't be true.
1344000	1347000	And so everybody just short circuited at the institutional level.
1347000	1349000	So whether it was that and I just kept going.
1349000	1350000	And I was like, fuck this.
1350000	1351000	I know what this is.
1351000	1357000	I'm just going to keep pursuing this and my soul and spirit ultimately comes along and, you know, go build this tree of knowledge.
1357000	1368000	As obvious allow symbolism there and ultimately finds its way back to a garden and a tree of life and finds redemption in relationship to how to actually, you know, follow this path.
1368000	1371000	Perhaps this isn't something you always focus on in your talks by my interest.
1371000	1378000	As you say, there's the two sides there of the institution, like either this is common sense or it's crazy in which case they're ignored, right?
1378000	1380000	Because if it's common sense, we all know it, don't bother with it.
1380000	1382000	If it's crazy, it's crazy, don't bother with it.
1382000	1388000	What sort of, what did you have to do from there on to get it into the institution?
1388000	1405000	Did you have you almost like developed a technique to get, you know, under unknown what you'd consider facts or unknown theories into something which is built in such a way as to just ignore them?
1405000	1406000	Yeah, well, it's really fascinating.
1406000	1411000	I mean, so, I mean, I'm both my parents, my dad's a professor, my mom's an adjunct professor.
1411000	1413000	I spent my entire time in the academy.
1413000	1415000	So, I'm a total academic insider.
1415000	1425000	I'm at the University of Vermont, at the University of Virginia for my pre-doc, I go to the University of Pennsylvania, and then I go from here to a professorship here at James Madison, which is actually where my undergraduate is.
1425000	1435000	So, I'm born and bred, not upper tier Harvard, okay, although I hang out with those people, but I'm on the outside, but just one epsilon down.
1435000	1437000	The University of Pennsylvania is pretty close.
1437000	1444000	Anyway, the bottom line is that, so I'm under the impression that the academy gives a shit about truth.
1444000	1451000	I mean, it was naive, you know, but, you know, I was under that impression, even though I was socialized, they told me that, they told me they cared about that.
1451000	1464000	And they told me if you followed the reasonable steps of publication and architecture, unlike somebody like Wilbur, I could look at Wilbur and like, ah, he went the whole of, he's not a serious academic, you know, you publish your fucking books, get a bunch of people following you.
1464000	1476000	But if you sit in the core in the epicenter, you know, I work with Aaron T. Beck, the father of cognitive therapy, I'm at the University of Pennsylvania, I'm running studies, I'm making connections with people, and I tell the inside people, I have this theory.
1476000	1485000	Okay, and then I publish in the review of general psychology in 2003, that's when I come up with, so after I filled the thing, it takes me a long time.
1485000	1488000	Actually, first off, what I do is I actually go into physics.
1488000	1502000	I'm basically four years conceptually learning all of physics, that I don't do math, but I needed to learn strength theory, I need to learn loop count of gravity, I need to learn black hole thermodynamics, I need to learn all that shit, and no standard theory of elementary particle physics ups and downs, conceptually.
1502000	1515000	And the reason was because this thing is a networked structure, and I needed to understand the energy information networking that happens both at Big Bang and quantum field theory so that I could be grounded in the kinds of evolutionary stuff that happens with matter.
1515000	1530000	Anyway, the point of it is that then once I had done that, I then grew into biology, understood cell theory, understood genetics, understood really evolution, understood the classic modern synthesis, it's weaknesses in relationship to a bunch of other things I didn't get into.
1530000	1542000	Then I fundamentally understand, you know, mind behavior, cognition structures around the animal world, and I actually had to digest Skinner. Skinner was actually the hardest fucking person to digest really interesting.
1543000	1550000	Finally digested Skinner, and was in 2001 and developed a thing that would come behavioral investment theory.
1550000	1558000	Okay, which is actually the last of the four pieces that make up the unified theories, free of knowledge justification systems, the influence matrix of support the idea.
1558000	1575000	So the investment theory was the last piece, some ways the most common sensical, but it was the piece that afforded me the bridge between cognitive science, neuroscience evolutionary theory and skinnerian radical behavior, which is actually connects to Skinner's key insights but it doesn't buy as epistemology.
1575000	1585000	Anyway, as maybe a lot, maybe too much here, but this to get to the bottom point, I then solve the problem and have Skinner, because I had solved the problem of Freud with justification.
1585000	1594000	And then I could show that the Tree of Knowledge said that Skinner dealt with this joint point, okay, between life to mind, and then Freud's fundamental insight was between mind and culture.
1594000	1609000	And then I could build a unified approach that took Skinner's core insights, Freud's core insight and stuck it on a physical, biological, animal psychological, human psychological societal, into science picture that was undeniably coherent.
1610000	1624000	And then I published that in the division one journal, review of general psychology in 2003. And when I got that accepted, I was like, I'm done, you know, you put your policy things and then all right, no real journal, you know, that's a good impact factor.
1624000	1634000	And I was like, holy shit, all right, I'm going to emails are going to fly it in, you know, I got three fucking emails from the goddamn thing was unbelievable. Nobody said.
1634000	1643000	So, so the, and the reason I didn't know this at the time is that academic institutional knowledge is fundamentally not just about truth claims.
1643000	1652000	The truth claims embedded in a justification system in the proper zone of proximal development where the institution is already decided this is an answer they care about.
1652000	1662000	Okay, so for example, when the DNA finding happened. All right, Watson, Crick, Roslyn, all those people, when they all got together, everyone was looking for the double healer.
1662000	1676000	And they knew it was going to be unbelievably important. So you had this massive technological race of all the big name people that were all on the edge of their seats wondering who's going to win crystallized analysis of the particular molecular structures pop and boom, you
1676000	1691000	get, oh my God, there's a race we get to it. Four fucking pages and the whole thing blows up. Right. Okay. But if no ever the institution already decided that this is an unanswerable question and already go over committed to a epistemological
1691000	1703000	methodological approach of research to publish something that has no data on it. And it's this meta theory that no one else in the institution has any basic frame of reference or even judging.
1703000	1715000	It fits there. You publish it and everyone's looking at us. That's a really interesting paper from all these different angles, but there's no institutional momentum to leverage anything. And so it just sits there in the abyss.
1715000	1730000	Okay, I ended up getting lucky I then published two special issues in the Journal of clinical psychology, and then brought a bunch of people together that are main people, Dave Gary, Keith Stanovich, Paul Gilbert, I mean these are major people in the field that
1730000	1744000	are coming on the thing. Still though, this, the ideas were so far away from the institutional contingencies and status, and would actually require complete rewriting of the way we did shit if they actually believed in them.
1744000	1757000	The problem is the ideas themselves then ground against the institutional structure. So everyone just sort of looks at them and like, Well now what the hell you're going to do you actually have to back up all your influence and investment patterns, and then reboot them.
1757000	1771000	Because this thing is told you you've actually took a long turn 100 fucking years ago, and now you have to reestablish the way the entire structure is built, and all the all the pinkers of the world, I mean not like I have any specific gripe with him, but all the pinkers in the world.
1771000	1778000	I was going to stop their full professorship at Harvard and be like, Okay, actually everybody time for a reboot, you know, nobody's going to do that.
1778000	1790000	You know, so then I realized is actually about the time is actually this isn't about the academics, it's about the children, you got to build a garden and build a preschool around the garden and then get the kids all socialized in and look to 2050 on this thing.
1790000	1798000	The back half of the 21st century, rather than trying to convince the institutional structures, I mean this is a late time realization so I'm jumping ahead.
1798000	1811000	But ultimately, the structure was so far the ideological structure of the unified theory so far away from the contingent and expected conventional structure of the way the academic institution in general psychology is built.
1811000	1817000	This is just dead on arrival essentially in relationship to its capacity to make an influence.
1817000	1835000	Yeah, and I love the phrase behavior investment theory I would love to hear more about that because it sounds like it's very tied into this dynamic that you're talking about where when you present an idea that has the power to reframe or reconstitute an entire institution what you're really doing is
1835000	1849000	asking it to pay a gigantic cost. And unless there's the appearance of a equivalent benefit, you know, they're really dealing with an economic question, are we willing to take this giant risk, does it really seem like it's going to be worth it.
1849000	1862000	And so truth is the pursuit of truth is kind of subject to our ability to reconcile it with the psycho economics, even on an individual level or on an institutional level.
1862000	1865000	And I just, I just love to hear more about that.
1865000	1866000	Of course. Yeah.
1866000	1873000	So behavior investment theory is you picked up on the first key principle is a principle of energy economics.
1873000	1889000	Okay, so it's got a set of different principles. The overarching picture is basically this, you get organisms with their genes and their cells and their organ systems growing reproducing living and engages complex adaptive systems.
1889000	1901000	Okay, but they're, they're bound in relationship to their movement to either reproduction individual cell movement or slow collective multi cellular movement.
1901000	1912000	Or the vine. Okay, it's not a lot of fun. All right, they move if you speed up the tape you can see oh my god that vine just sort of ate that tree. Okay, but you got to be there for like 25 years.
1912000	1930000	All right. So they don't move and anywhere. Well then what nature developed is this is a whole other orthogonal dimension of complex adaptive behavior that if you have a nervous system and a muscular system and a segmented body around it, you get that plant like thing up and you start moving it around.
1930000	1938000	Okay, and that's amazing. And so your whole neuromuscular structure with a centralized control system at the brain and the segmented body.
1938000	1945000	All right, it's about moving fundamentally. Okay, as a singular functional whole.
1945000	1953000	Now how do how if your nature what fundamentally are you going to organize the movement around.
1953000	1957000	Okay, and the answer basically reproducing without permission.
1958000	1968000	That's certainly true and surviving survival reproduction, but now it's basically and that's the bio but that's still the biological metabolic structure overall so the embodiment is trying to do that.
1968000	1981000	But now you basically have to do the nervous system is an engineer takes a lot of calories on top of that to do what you're going to move the system toward the good and away from the bad relative to costs.
1981000	1990000	Okay, fundamentally. So essentially what you have to do is the work effort that takes to metabolize the brain to organize the system and then to move it.
1990000	1998000	Okay, is the fundamental key. I'll give you an example. There's a little thing called a sea squirt. Okay, it's an unusual little creature early in the world.
1998000	2007000	Okay, a little sea squirt and it's got a little brain and it gets reproduced as an animal, and then its job is to find a good location for itself.
2007000	2018000	So it swims around and is hunting for a particular place to land. And then when it lands it attaches, and then it basically translates into a plant, because it's now fits there.
2018000	2028000	You know what it does with its brain when it's located there, it eats it. Okay, because it no longer needs a brain. All right, because it's now just dead calories.
2028000	2041000	So what the brain fundamentally is about doing is about coordinating the behavior of the animal as a whole. Okay, toward the good in essence away from the bad relative to cost opportunity functions risk cost opportunity functions.
2041000	2053000	So fundamentally it's an energy economic system work effort relative to time relative to cost relative to opportunities that's constantly making predictions about the positive behavioral investment.
2053000	2069000	Okay, I'm going to spend my energy here. If you know John Berbeke at all, you know recursive relevance realization. Well that's the cognitive structure is determining a particular space of what's relevant to then realize what you can predict and then realize what you can
2069000	2081000	accomplish. And that is the process by which the cognitive system builds paths of behavioral investment. And I was recognized the basic architecture of a path of behavioral investment, which is a work effort path to achieve a particular
2081000	2096000	outcome relative to risk relative to other possible paths. So you can almost think of yourself like a, you know, like a quantum particle, essentially what the brain does is it creates a multiple path analysis calculates path of least effort resistance, and then engages in a
2096000	2109000	particular effort to realize those particular outcomes. That's the core of the nervous system organization and behavioral investment theory says hey if you do that, you take nervous science and it's fundamentals like Carl Friston and predicted processing active inference.
2109000	2121000	You take BF Skinner and the way the behavior of the animal as a whole and the environment takes it. You take people like John Berbeke and you get recursive relevance realization. You tie them all together put it on evolutionary foundation and Cambrian explosion.
2121000	2133000	And then you have a mind brain behavior synthesis that affords you clarity about the complex adaptive processes by which these systems navigate the agent arena relation.
2133000	2146000	Perfect. Perfect. I have two things to comment on one. I'm a big Wilhelm Reich fan and he talks about the psycho the sex economic, you know, systems a lot like that's where that's that's my entry into this metaphor.
2146000	2147000	Yeah.
2147000	2160000	And also, I have a complaint and I wonder if you share it. The, there's been a lot of hype in the last, I don't know, 70 years or so about game theory, and about, you know, these economic predictions of rational actors.
2160000	2168000	And then that hype was, you know, disappointed as it turned out that people quote, didn't actually pursue their best interest.
2168000	2169000	Right.
2169000	2181000	But it seems to me like they merely didn't include the psycho economic calculations in those that we are really rational actors, but we don't know what we want. In fact, we kind of can't do a certain extent.
2181000	2198000	So, right. So, right, the rational economic man, I mean, serious people never always knew that was a fallacy. But nonetheless, if you apply it in general populations as economic actors, you can get a general nomenthetic principle that makes a lot of fucking good prediction.
2198000	2214000	And then the question is, what do you mean by rational? Okay, and certainly I'll tell you what we know you don't mean is we do not mean an analytic money calculator. Okay, that fits in a pure knowing system and says I'm going to maximize my $10 relative to $10 I spend or lose.
2214000	2227000	And everything will be according to that. And, you know, just basic similar is like, Oh my God, I'm going to go buy this pair of pants. If I know it's $30. And then I realize down the road, I can get it for 15. Well, I walk down the road and get it for 15. Fuck yeah.
2227000	2240000	Okay, but if I'm going to go buy a car, and it's $20,000, and it's $15 cheeser down the road, it's $20,000, fucking 15 bucks. I don't give a crap. It's $15 for walking down the road. Okay, but no, that's not the way we think.
2240000	2253000	Okay, so we know that there's a huge numbers of ways in which we calculate, you know, monetary economics. And then they basically said, Okay, we're going to do computational algorithms on maximizing this in this space.
2253000	2265000	And you're exactly right. In fact, I have a blog. Okay, behavioral investment theories, the missing link in economics. Okay, you don't drop the energy economic system into a justified rational algorithmic system.
2265000	2275000	So if you do it generalizably, a bunch of bag actors, you do get it. I mean, a bunch of actors, you'll get an invisible hand effect. Okay, so you can make calculations nomenthetically about it.
2275000	2283000	But you can also see people violate that all the time. And underneath what you have is a justifying system that's trying to satisfy some context.
2284000	2298000	It's sitting on a behavioral investment primate system that goes all the way into an animal organism system. And the calculus of those energy economic processes are not maximizing your dollar bottom line by any stretch.
2298000	2311000	Okay, so you're going to maximize a certain kind of utility, and you better be clear about the utility that the system is attempting to maximize and behavioral investment theory clarifies the foundational utility energy investments that are actually operating.
2311000	2317000	And if you don't have that, you're going to miss the entire economic bubble at the level of trying to hyper rationalize it.
2317000	2322000	Yeah, yeah, I'm super into this and the
2323000	2330000	Well, something you just said about how it how it all kind of plugs down into the animal, the biological economic systems as well.
2330000	2342000	Since your your framework is intended to be holistic and in terms of like map of the universe, the whole thing, all the all the levels of study all the levels of you know materialization.
2343000	2350000	It makes me kind of wonder if this leads all the way down to a, you know, physics is economical.
2350000	2366000	Sub quantum physics is economical that maybe in a way this could this aligns with Leibniz's idea of we live in the best possible world, because the universe is incredibly economic like that's the fundamental feature of it.
2366000	2378000	Yeah, go check out the principle of least action. Okay, and there's a thing called principle least action. And essentially, like if you have photon what is the path that a photon takes from a to B.
2378000	2388000	And it's organized although there's all the quantum possibilities. Actually, you asked some over the possibilities. And what you see is the principle of least action.
2388000	2402000	Okay, and so you can and the investment there is the principle of least effort, which is similar but actually it's a calculating thing, but you go all the way into physics and this gets into energy entropy relations, definitely, and a foundational principle
2402000	2426000	The principle of least action is that I could two or three videos that are brilliantly articulate just why this principle see it goes into quantum theory goes into general relativity, it goes into thermodynamics. Yeah, you know, energy economic concepts actually really deep in the stack, really deep in the stack so I totally appreciate that intuition.
2426000	2438000	That's awesome. That's really exciting. I'd already been thinking about live and it's because of the monotology and the idea that everything is the same at all scales and at different scales and right like that so all the things you were telling me about that we're, you know resonating there.
2438000	2448000	Yeah, but also, people have been occasionally, you know, objecting to idea market what we're building. How much do you know about about idea market and the basic premises.
2448000	2456000	Not much. Okay, I dropped myself into one particular theory and mind that as much as possible. It's hard for me to pay attention to the rest of the world.
2456000	2474000	No, I 100,000% am the same way but in my particular little nerdy project so idea market is a method of valuing information using markets. If the world has to decide what to pay attention to and has limited attention for many choices to make.
2474000	2486000	We use markets to allocate between, you know, scarce resources between parties is conflicting interests for every other asset class why not information why not attention as that's the basic idea.
2486000	2500000	And we often get this objection like, aren't isn't truth and money or information and money aren't they like fundamentally different things isn't money like kind of corrupt and it has its own incentives and stuff like that.
2500000	2514000	And what I'm starting to feel more and more comfortable saying is, no, they're really like the same thing and our money is an abstraction of, of attention they're both scarce resources that we're constantly investing and justifying and risk managing.
2514000	2519000	And that the closer we get to the metaphor the better things will work not the worse.
2519000	2530000	I really appreciate that I mean money is a symbol of potential energy and then and then the ways in which people are going to hold that collective potential energy and then distribute it and turn it into kinetic energy as they buy, right.
2531000	2550000	Is is an unbelievably powerful force and we definitely want to align. I mean the key is how do we align our economic incentives to create market forces that actually then feed back on shit we actually should be eating and relating to and experiencing as opposed to Twinkies, you know, and killing the coral reefs, you know, I mean that's
2551000	2565000	So the issue is, to me the issue is yes there's an enormous pragmatic force function in relationship to potential and kinetic market energy. If you can align the proper, you know, and then how and who's controlling what interest and all that other set number no
2566000	2583000	But fundamentally that proper relation is absolutely essential. And if we're going to actually evolve into this what I call this new weird digital age structure, part of the evolution of money and attention and ideas and all of this will ideally be a more coherent and
2583000	2596000	complementarily relation. I certainly don't think it's guaranteed and there are a lot of interest in indications that they can, I mean look what happened to the Academy, you know, I mean my psychology, it then because of its institutional investments, it gets in the long
2596000	2610000	class and now it's got sunk cost investment on a particular structure and then you get people in power that need to maintain a sunk cost investment because their own status is built on it, and you know it's certainly system get corrupt.
2610000	2618000	Yeah, certainly. I just think it aligns really well with your, you know, the behavior investment theory. This is kind of a belief investment theory or an attention investment theory.
2618000	2620000	Right. And yeah.
2620000	2634000	So, right. And so what we really do want, I mean, there are ideas, you have perceptual reasoning ideas, these are your pictorial network ideas or the salt base here, go into your what can be called perspectival knowing and other kinds of procedural
2634000	2639000	knowledge technological stuff which turns skill and other things recipes into power.
2639000	2653000	But yet, in terms of raw ideas, the theoretical ideas, the schematic semantic structures of understanding. Fuck, man, we can get there. I mean, my whole point is why aren't we, this is when me and the problem of psychology sort of intersects is like, how would we get the
2653000	2664000	attentional system to be aware of a common sense reality that this is a giant problem that we actually should care about. And if you actually had somebody that could solve it, we actually would care about that. I don't know how to make that
2664000	2669000	work, but it seems like an ABC to me that maybe you guys can figure out.
2669000	2686000	No, that's exactly one of the things that inspired me to do something that became this, which is the gap between the world's best information and common knowledge is so huge. And we have the internet now so it's not an access
2686000	2700000	problem. There's a there's there's a curiosity problem or a sunk cost problem there's all these sort of inertia type problems have nothing to do with access that we have discoveries that would change civilization more than the printing
2700000	2713000	press, just sitting on the proverbial table or in our pockets, and we're just not picking it up like that's we're one physical gesture away from revolutionizing what it means to be a human being and a lot of ways.
2714000	2732000	So what I'm what I'm hoping, you know, having a market incentive will do is kind of pay people to be curious to check out those disruptions because that's where the profit is in every other market. If you look at startups, if you look at stocks, the all the money is made by VCs who look
2732000	2752000	at what's, you know, what's the unlikely but high impact thing. And how can I get there before everyone else. And if we can enrich people for doing that for information, then there will be a whole lot more attention on discovering and growing those high impact knowledge pieces that we have no
2752000	2753000	structure for right now.
2753000	2757000	Dude, you know, that guy. Yes. Hey, amen.
2757000	2765000	As somebody fucking found a little rabbit hole and built a unified $3 now look around on, you know, live here and do a strap going today. Does anybody care about this? You know, it's like people like what?
2765000	2777000	But if we can you can fill an ecology, you know, in structure contingency system that actually would cultivate the capacity of that process to get positive feedback on the investment. Well, Jesus, you know, that'd be beautiful. I love it.
2777000	2790000	Yeah, where we are hacking on that, man, we want to we're basically trying to use, you know, behavior investment theory and this this idea that even even telep probably one of the most respected economists today he says rationality is risk management.
2790000	2801000	Man, those four words, like we could take those incredibly seriously and I think get some serious, you know, revolution type activity out of it.
2801000	2802000	Totally.
2802000	2815000	Just just just to be able to, you know, change the incentive landscape of curiosity. Now that we have the knowledge, we need, you know, the incentives and the environment that supports people who take advantage of that knowledge instead of shining.
2815000	2834000	There's sort of a paradox there though. I mean, in terms of if to look at this once again psychologically, which is that, you know, this is quite what I'm going to say is quite rough. But in terms of, you know, the psychology, it's like people who are trying to heal themselves might be stuck in a loop of doing the same thing.
2834000	2849000	But what is it that is stopping them in terms of your theory of making that rational leap to say, Well, you know, we've been doing X 1000 times and we're still miserable. Why don't we look at why, which is, you know, undervalued or underrated or hidden away.
2849000	2862000	Why did why why is that leap from common knowledge, which is making you repeatedly depressed, anxious, whatever, never made to the smaller thing.
2863000	2871000	Well, I'll speak. Why don't I just situate my reply. I can go a lot of different ways I can go with a clinician in relationship to that, but I'll just situate.
2871000	2881000	I know and I have a much better understanding with regards to at least my, my own theory as to why it's a nightmare in terms of trying to get change in the short term.
2882000	2900000	And that is because it's this unbelievably complex cathedral architecture. And I was, I was focused simply on getting the cathedral right in inside of it and not thinking at all about a sort of a marketing thing that would make it accessible for whatever populace might be interested in
2900000	2908000	digesting it and using it so that it's in the zone of proximal investment where you're actually like, Oh, I know actually how to use this and then I can use it in a cumulative way.
2908000	2917000	People, if you're in a particular loop or in just in general, people are looking for things in the short term generally that they can then operate on and demonstrate benefit from.
2917000	2927000	Okay, the way I built the system, although I'm super excited about it from the inside, if you try to get at it from the outside, and especially when I built it originally.
2927000	2941000	It was so far away and so focused on a particular type of angle of precision and clarity of logic that doesn't that didn't fit with the leveraging of what people sort of wanted and then to try to actually trail yourself to it.
2941000	2949000	Grab a hold of it from sort of the outside, and I have a particular gift that can see it many people don't so it's very kind of clunky and confusing.
2949000	2960000	And so you get this clunky confusing very complicated thing. And I say it's like learning a language like you know people like people come to me like you know I spent a weekend looking at your stuff I'm not sure I understand your theory.
2960000	2971000	It's like, it's like understanding French people I mean you know it's like, it's like I went to a weekend workshop on French and I didn't speak it at all before and I don't know that I fully and fluid in French you're like yeah you're not fully included.
2972000	2975000	You talk, you spend a weekend with it.
2975000	2984000	So, I, so my devoted my first part of my life and to build the thing, because that's what I'm gifted at I can do that I have a high level.
2984000	2993000	You know, theory capacity and can then put it together that other people can see my task now is where the theories pretty. I will see but it feels tight.
2993000	3005000	Okay, it feels like all right I built the cathedral. I'm hopeful that there'll be grounds that grow off of it still. I love the creative process, but the actual essence of you talk is essentially feels very, very tight now.
3005000	3020000	And now the issue is now that because the system is done, and I can now situated in what knowledge systems are, my hope is is that I can now package it with appropriate framings for appropriate audiences so that they know how to enter it and begin the process of
3020000	3032000	digesting it so that it's useful to them where they are, which by the way is going to require a number of different entry points depending on what the audience is. But as it sits now, I think it's getting to be a point that's ready.
3032000	3043000	And that's where I am developmentally like, oh, now I'm really looking to sync up with people show them what this goddamn thing can do, and then have them actually help me market it in a particular ways in different places.
3043000	3056000	So that then those individuals that are in those places or whatever looping, then can see, hey, yes, I may want something better. Oh my God, but this is, hey, if you're there, and this thing's here, I know how to get you to here and here and have that be a very reinforcing
3056000	3066000	path that cultivates behavioral investment and justification so that you can grow and then use this and apply it in a way that's helpful to you.
3066000	3079000	Do you have particular carrots built into it? Do you have like, yeah, how do you how do you sell it? How do you how do you, you know, what's the economic equation of getting people to go through this?
3079000	3095000	I mean, there's, so now there's, I mean, the, the, there's the analytic carrot, okay, that I framed. So it actually, it says, hey, if you're an analytic type and think in terms of problems and problems to solve, the thing solves three core problems.
3095000	3101000	Okay, there's actually a problem of psychotherapy. I'm actually president of the Society for psychotherapy integration.
3101000	3110000	So I can speak about authority in terms of say up, there's a real problem with psychotherapy. There's the problem of psychology. And then there's what I call the enlightenment gap.
3110000	3120000	Okay, the enlightenment gap is that when science and the enlightenment philosophers like Kant came along, they built a new epistemological system.
3120000	3136000	But it then came with two massive problems. Okay, one is I already talked matter mind relation, they never saw matter mind body problem or colloquial, we can just everyone's got six, hard problem consciousness, all this, you know, nobody knows how to frame that.
3136000	3142000	And there's also a core problem in relationship to the nature of scientific knowledge relative to social and subjective knowledge. Okay.
3142000	3154000	In terms of like, what is true about scientific knowledge and what is contextual. And you can see this in the modernist epistemological frame versus the postmodern critique of modernity.
3154000	3169000	Okay, so modern versus postmodern mind versus body enlightenment gap is like we have a broken synthetic philosophy. Okay, so for the analytics out there you're like, Hey, that's my diagnosis enlightenment gap problem psychology problem psychotherapy.
3169000	3183000	You talk is by far the only systems in the ballpark. And if you actually really are an ag head academic. Okay, then boom. Okay, so now you can say, All right, here's an architecture and this is actually I saw that you have to, if you're going to be, you're really going to understand if you're
3183000	3187000	looking for intellectual understanding, then you have to devote and study and learn. Okay.
3187000	3196000	Then there's a lot of other things that actually can bite off of it I developed the whole thing back here in terms of so there are different points that you can pull off of it and say I'm just going to use this thing.
3196000	3204000	Okay, so like the fourth one the yellow circle is the influence matrix. Okay, right in the center of the influence matrix is a black line.
3204000	3212000	The influence matrix measures your is a map of your heart. And what I mean by that is your relationship system is how you feel connected to other people.
3212000	3227000	And what you have inside of you is you track at the core of your relational process you track your social influence. This is how much you can instrumentally influence other people based on your interest, and you track your relational value.
3227000	3238000	Okay, this is the extent to which you're known and valued by important others. All right, and you have a relationship system is squizzedly attuned to tracking this RV SI process.
3238000	3250000	Okay, relational value and social influence. When somebody comes to me clinically in a normal psychotherapeutic sense, an enormous amount of the pain is because they experience low and traumatic RV SI problems.
3250000	3264000	I'm not valued. I have no social influence. Okay. Well, a jam here that says actually what we should be doing relationally, because what we're really tracking at our heart is the felt sense of relational value to the extent we're known and valued.
3264000	3277000	Do you know what we do in our economic world, we basically maximize social influence. Okay, in other words, we basically say hey, how can we actually create an economic indicator of how much influence power you have, aka money bottom line.
3277000	3283000	And how do we deploy monetary economic structures to get more influence out of people.
3283000	3294000	All right, well, from a policy perspective, what that essentially does is you just manipulate people based on social influence, and you distance that from true relational value, you'll kill the heart soul.
3294000	3300000	Okay, people will feel manipulated. They'll try to gather shit, but deep down inside they'll feel really empty.
3300000	3314000	There's another nugget from a policy perspective in relationship to governance and economics issues like what the fuck, we're actually cultivating a social influence Machiavellian structure, when we actually are really attending to our felt sense of relational value.
3314000	3322000	So you wonder why we got a mental health crisis pop it around. Well, there's an idea. And maybe we should build our systems where people are known in value. Okay.
3322000	3327000	And the last thing I'll do is like you pull the last black.
3327000	3334000	That thing on the dot on the tree over there. And that's a mindfulness symbol. That's an eye looking down. Okay.
3334000	3340000	And the last apple on the tree is an integrated approach to psychological mindfulness. Okay.
3340000	3349000	And really what it does is it's part of a system that distills the problems that people have psychotherapeutically that drive into psychotherapy. Okay.
3349000	3358000	Internalizing neurotic problems that make up about 80 70 to 80% of what I treat. Okay. And they're basically can be summarized as this. All right.
3358000	3365000	People get in what are called triple negative neurotic loops. All right. What's that triple negative neurotic loops.
3365000	3368000	It's very promising at face value. All right.
3368000	3376000	What happens to people is that they get negative situations. Boom. Life bumps them. Okay. You got to break up your car. You know, shit happens.
3376000	3383000	You look bad, etc. Other people screw you over, etc. Okay. You got conflict. All right. Shit that you don't want.
3383000	3389000	Then you get a negative feeling set around that because that's actually what your emotion behavioral investment system is designed to do.
3389000	3400000	Like that's bad. Try to compensate and avoid for that and send the signal that you just experienced pain. Okay. And then orient either anger, shame, guilt, loss.
3400000	3411000	Okay. That's what the that's what your primary system is designed to do. Then what happens is your person system comes along, puts those feelings and the situation in contact and has a third negative reaction.
3411000	3423000	It says, fuck, I don't want these feelings and I don't like the situation and I'm going to try to control it. I'm going to try to get my feelings out of there, control the situation, control myself, blame myself, blame other.
3423000	3430000	And the way in which you then second blame the feelings and the situation makes shit worse.
3430000	3439000	And then now you're more vulnerable, more defensive, more agitated and more likely that negative shit happened to you because you didn't cope effectively.
3439000	3446000	So then boom, you get more negative, more negative feelings, more negative anxiety about the second and you got a triple negative neurotic.
3446000	3454000	Just, just, sorry, just jumping Greg, just speaking of negative things. I know Mike, Mike's got to leave us, but I've got a fair, quite a lot more, quite a lot more questions for you.
3454000	3459000	So, Mike, thanks for being here. And yeah, me and you Greg will carry on.
3459000	3461000	Perfect. All right.
3461000	3463000	Great to meet you Greg. It's been a pleasure.
3463000	3476000	Hey, enjoyed it. So one, I mean, we can continue on this, this, this, this negative root, but one big question I have and perhaps this is a really, perhaps this is a really obvious one, but it's what stops someone from drawing.
3476000	3492000	So what you're looking at with your unified theory of knowledge in it's in that word unified is there is these separate bits, which people have drawn lines around behaviorism with skinner, psychodynamic, sort of Carl Rogers, et cetera, people have drawn lines around and they've gone, that's over there, that's over there, that's over there.
3492000	3506000	Perhaps it's perhaps it's blindingly obvious, but what is to stop someone coming along and drawing a line around unified unified theory of psychology and saying that is just a theory.
3506000	3514000	Right. Okay, so that's, that's a certainly a good question you then have to decide what you mean by a theory.
3515000	3522000	And so the, the unified theory of knowledge. Okay, so let's back up with the unified theory of knowledge. Okay.
3522000	3543000	It's, it is a philosophical system and properly really a kind of philosophical system called a meta psychological system, which means it's specifically positioned between the base of philosophy and whatever we would call the branch of psychology and mind soul spirit.
3543000	3553000	Along those lines, and so that it lives in that particular kind of space. So people were to interpret the word theory as like, Oh, it's just a theory.
3553000	3558000	The semantic meaning of the word theory is not what's meant here. Okay.
3558000	3567000	So, so the first thing that it is is a theory of knowledge, which would then back up and say, Well, what do you mean, and it starts with a metaphysical picture.
3567000	3580000	Okay, a metaphysical picture means that I'm going to be very clear about the concepts and categories that I am now going to deploy to let you make sense out of the world.
3580000	3585000	Okay, so it'd be like, it's just a theory that this is a conversation.
3585000	3599000	But not really, I'm using the concept conversation to apply to the dialogue that you and I are having to then say it's just a theory that it's a conversation misconstrues the word theory.
3599000	3611000	It's actually a descriptive concept that has a particular nominological relation between events. And that's actually where I start. So it's a descriptive metaphysical system to begin with.
3611000	3621000	Okay, then when you get into the, that's why it's learning like a language. Okay. All right, so it then organize this language in a particular kind of way.
3621000	3636000	And then what it starts to do is it says it affords you the opportunity to apply the language of various facets and decide how intelligible the world appears to be as you learn the language.
3636000	3648000	So outside of that, I mean, if someone was to come along and say, well, you know, a conversation is just the theory and they start pulling everything apart and deconstructing, they would almost be leaning on to the side of sort of madness.
3648000	3657000	Right, that point where, well, if, if sort of saying, if you're going to disagree on what a conversation is, then you're leaning into a sort of a relativism, which is for practical purposes, completely useless.
3658000	3672000	Totally. Now, I mean, to come along and it is a kind of question answer justification to say, I don't think, you know, what is your theory really prove? Okay, we're going to know what that propositional network essentially refers to.
3672000	3684000	And we're going to have to gain some reference. It doesn't refer to everything. And obviously, if you simply want to be some sort of radical skeptic that nothing is intelligible under any circumstances and I can always throw silly questions at it.
3684000	3698000	I'm not terribly interested in wandering around that world. If somebody wants to be like, okay, I'm going to be such a radical deconstructionist by the time this question lands in sound, I've already decided that nothing makes sense.
3698000	3708000	It's like, fine, you can go, you can go do that if you want. I'm actually interested in coherent integrated intelligibility that affords the capacity for sense making across a wide variety of different domains.
3708000	3710000	So what would this look like in practice?
3714000	3717000	Well, it depends on what you mean by there's a way.
3717000	3726000	So as I perhaps I've misunderstood, perhaps I've misunderstood little bits of it as you're bringing in all these other, you know, psychological lineages of psychology.
3727000	3743000	Is this, is this a, you know, once again use that word theory, but is this a theory that is intended for use in a clinical setting, or is it a foundational thing to allow for, you know, different, should we say like blossoms of clinical settings.
3743000	3756000	Right. It actually, so this is great. That's why I asked. And actually you can go foundational down into it is about, it's a framework for living, essentially in the back half of the 21st century.
3758000	3761000	What do you mean by what? Okay, you're going to have to expand on that.
3762000	3778000	Right. So the actual structure of it is, okay, is an organization of knowledge oriented towards wisdom that would be placed in the collective of humanity if it could be afforded the educational socialized
3778000	3798000	potential network that would then download itself in relationship to the human collected conscious and serve as an organizing, meaning making experiential system that would be ingrained in the knowledge system of humanity to organize its collective behavior in the back half of the 21st century.
3799000	3801000	So that's the, that's the ultimate.
3802000	3803000	We're not ready for it yet.
3804000	3810000	That's another way of saying that. So I think I saw somewhere that you see is coming in at around 2050.
3812000	3820000	Right. That's a 20 or 2050 starts the back half. I actually will be dying. So that's a, you know, hopefully in terms of living.
3821000	3842000	But no, it's a, I'm now very convinced that we were talking about a paradigmatic grounding that was going to require generations, one to two generations of understanding in order to deep dive into the ground of it and then afford the capacity of the ground of it to be then built in individuals that are socialized into it.
3843000	3858000	You know, like people that are born post 2007, you know, in terms of, oh, are you a digital native? Okay. Like, well, you're a digital native. Oh, you actually, you, you know, you live for better or for worse, you live in the iPod world.
3858000	3868000	And we're, we're, we're, you know, we're text and Tik Tok and the internet and video is just a given. Okay. Those of us that were born in 1970. Okay.
3869000	3872000	Are the watch the whole thing and we're, we don't live in that world.
3873000	3883000	There, there are foundational systems of understanding that we all have been socialized in, in the modern and postmodern context of our chaotic fragmented pluralism. Okay.
3883000	3894000	That are actually that make, if you've got socialized them and you wander around with these systems of understanding these ideological ideas and frameworks and they use their make, you know, partial sense.
3895000	3906000	But now you're basically baked into a system of understanding like my parents would never, ever, ever, despite the fact that my dad's a history professor, ever be able to understand what the fuck I'm talking about.
3907000	3920000	Okay. And the reason is because his set of understandings is a history professor about what the human condition is and what the mind is and how we understand the world, which is, you know, he's a professor and a very good one.
3921000	3935000	He's anchored to a set of conceptions about mind and matter and the way the world works and what physics is and all of this stuff that, that those preconceptions would are, would have to be completely unfrozen and melted and then reconstituted in a foundational way.
3936000	3945000	That would have, that would be really, really, basically impossible. That's why I decided over time it's actually this is, this is a thing for the children, it's not for the parents.
3945000	3959000	This is something that actually needs to be, you need to be socialized into the harmonized system so you can actually not make all the baked in errors that are actually populating us currently right now, which contributes massively to the chaotic fragmented.
3959000	3968000	That's the incredible theory, which, which I'm super interested in, which means almost what you're talking about is almost the plasticity of consciousness, right? A certain point it's like, no, you're locked in.
3968000	3984000	You're locked in, you, you don't get the next bit. So I mean, but do you, does, does your, would you, would your theory allow for the, the remelting of the consciousness to then, you know, allow the consciousness to, to expand so it doesn't become locked in as, as, as we have been in generations.
3985000	3997000	Well, I mean, you have to, okay, so, right, there are, there's potentiality for melting and reconstituting. Okay. But there's also an enormous amount of inertia and stasis and resistance. Okay.
3997000	4010000	So for example, like clinically, okay, if, if you would, we have a thing called stage or change, if somebody's pre contemplative that the, okay, meaning that they're not even aware that the problem is around.
4011000	4025000	Somebody's a drinker, for example, is like, I'm not really a drinker. I have no problems. It's all fine. That's called pre contemplative. Okay. And then you were to say to me, Hey, how are you going to help this person with their alcoholism in a pre contemplative stage?
4026000	4036000	And I'm, you know, unless you lock them up, which was worse than the cure, you know, I mean, the cure is worse than the disease, you could lock them up and then cure them that way, perhaps, and then they would hate you and be a prisoner.
4036000	4049000	So I'll let them drink. But the idea that I'm actually going to then help them when they decide that there's no problem, and they don't understand what this issue is to melt that problem to reconstitute it with no stage of change.
4050000	4061000	That's even contemplating this as an issue. And yeah, you're totally done. It's very similar to my intersection with the problem of the theory and the institution. The institution is chugging along.
4061000	4072000	Although now more than ever, people are like, I think there's real problems, but the institution is chugging along producing, you know, studies and trying to get better and the best of the best people are embedded in that investment system.
4073000	4088000	And they've done their accomplishments. I don't want to minimize it, but the collective is actually some is less than the parts. And because of because of the proliferation problem, but those those systems that they're doing okay, they're not going to melt and reconstitute in that kind of state.
4088000	4100000	So you have to you have to be in a particular state, kids that are looking to suck up and core organize their system is a great state, people that are looking for new solutions.
4100000	4107000	So now my theory, for example, is getting a lot more attention to last two to three years than ever had. There are some reasons for this.
4108000	4118000	But the main reason is I booted myself. I mean, I'm still a professor, but I basically told everybody's listen, I'm done with you guys fucking at the academy. I'm going to be a shaman on a hill professor.
4118000	4124000	I'm going to stop publishing. I'm going to do cartoons for my theory and go out and talk to the innovators and the internet.
4125000	4133000	Okay, so I made that move because I decided the inertia of the institution, even though my lifelong academic was pointless, the system can't move.
4133000	4146000	And then I find people that are in this meta modern or idea market space or whatever, the people that are on the edge, and they're starting to get together and then what happens you get Trump into me to and then you get covered in particular.
4146000	4159000	And now you get a collective system that is actually, I believe that the consciousness of the huge portions of individuals like, you know what, our institutions, they seem outmoded, outdated.
4159000	4170000	I am losing massive faith that they have the capacity to cultivate us in the necessary transition with the digital age and the environmental crisis and our mental health going insane.
4170000	4177000	A lot of people are looking around going, I don't know that we're well structured to manage whatever transition is happening.
4177000	4179000	So we better be looking for new ideas.
4179000	4191000	In other words, the consciousness of the collective societies, or at least many societies, I'm shifted from pre contemplative to contemplative, meaning that they're like, we should start looking for new ideas.
4191000	4195000	And now they start coming and they're like, okay, 20 years ago, I would have seen your ideas.
4195000	4198000	Okay, that's just so far out there, what the fuck, blah, blah, blah.
4198000	4200000	You see your crazy genius really a quack.
4200000	4201000	I don't need to pay attention.
4201000	4202000	Okay.
4202000	4206000	Now it's like, actually, maybe we do need to take some risks.
4206000	4209000	Maybe we do need to think and I'm seeing that collect completely.
4209000	4220000	I mean, people are definitely starting to wake up and starting to look around and starting to be willing to take some risk or some out of the box stuff and look for new visions that may actually really afford us something.
4220000	4221000	And I feel that.
4221000	4226000	What comes after the contemplative stage?
4226000	4230000	Well, you get then prep preparation and then action.
4230000	4234000	So you come and then basically you get, hey, I think I have a problem.
4234000	4238000	Okay, yes, I'm agreeing that I have a problem and about ready to do something about it.
4238000	4246000	And now I then drop into taking definitive specific steps to try to make change, at least in the classic stages.
4246000	4251000	Would you say your sort of exit from the Academy was the preparation and the action?
4251000	4256000	Say, look, the problem is, the problem is you guys, I'm off.
4256000	4257000	Well, right.
4257000	4264000	I mean, I was certainly, I mean, I've always been, you know, I'm invested in this whole, you know, this thing and I'm trying to get everybody else to change.
4264000	4269000	But there was a series of events that started to me to get pre contemplative.
4269000	4274000	Like, I mean, before I was, yeah, pre contemplative, I'm an academic, it's all going to come from the Academy.
4274000	4275000	Okay.
4275000	4291000	And then certain things start to happen and they start to wonder, hey, is this really, and then I actually stepped off my director role and tried to do a few things and that got me in sort of like, and it's much too, it'd be much too foresight for me to say I was really engaged in preparation.
4291000	4292000	It was a series of events.
4292000	4294000	I got in a huge fight with my program.
4294000	4298000	Jordan Peterson was a big deal in relationship to sort of serving as a catalyst.
4298000	4305000	There was a whole bunch of shit that happened, but it did cause me to re consolidate my identity and there was definitely stage of change stuff.
4305000	4312000	It's like, when am I going to really stop identifying as a classic academic and basically be like, no, I'm a shaman on a hill.
4312000	4314000	That was a transformation.
4314000	4319000	And then consolidated around that identity, you know, probably two years ago.
4319000	4322000	But actually, you use a lot of mythical and religious metaphor.
4322000	4325000	I mean, with the tree, the garden, you're mentioning now that you're a shaman.
4325000	4330000	Also, this idea that of it has to be targeted at children, you know, be like children as unto God.
4330000	4331000	I mean, I'm just, I'm just intrigued.
4331000	4333000	Are you a religious man yourself?
4333000	4337000	Or what does religion sit in this system as well?
4337000	4338000	Totally.
4338000	4339000	No.
4339000	4340000	So that's a great question.
4340000	4346000	So I get raised as a new atheist in terms of my particular structure.
4346000	4351000	As a Billy Graham conversion, when he's in his, I think, you know, 20s or so, early 20s.
4351000	4356000	And then the light goes out and he turns to history and we get raised with Dawkins and atheism and things like that.
4356000	4359000	And so I'm a hardcore behavioral scientist.
4359000	4361000	So my home is atheism.
4361000	4370000	That comes to mean to me without a, the prefaces A without theism or the belief in a personal, knowable, relatable God.
4370000	4371000	Okay.
4371000	4375000	So I, and I, and I remain that I remain an atheist in that sense.
4375000	4376000	Okay.
4376000	4378000	I'm also an agnostic.
4378000	4379000	All right.
4379000	4381000	I'm an atheist and an agnostic.
4381000	4382000	All right.
4382000	4384000	Which means that I'm, I'm not a foundationalist.
4384000	4385000	Okay.
4385000	4390000	At least when it comes to the ontic reality, the ontic is whatever the universe fundamentally is.
4390000	4397000	And do I have foundational unassailable knowledge of what the fundamental essence of the universe is?
4397000	4399000	My answer is I don't.
4399000	4405000	So I am agnostic about the fundamental ontic structure of reality.
4405000	4406000	Okay.
4406000	4408000	And then I'm a synthiest.
4408000	4409000	Okay.
4409000	4414000	A synthiest means believe, I believe in the concept of God.
4414000	4415000	Right.
4415000	4424000	And the potential for us to create a God like image and imaginal structure.
4424000	4432000	What it would mean for us to effectively project and collectively believe in the concept of God.
4432000	4433000	Okay.
4433000	4439000	So the concept of God makes no ontological and metaphysical claims about a personal God.
4439000	4446000	I'm agnostic at some level in the sense that, Hey, through our projections, God only knows what's mirroring back on us pun intended.
4446000	4447000	Okay.
4447000	4450000	And then so essentially I'm an agnostic atheistic synthiest.
4450000	4455000	And basically what that means is I'm agnostic about foundational ontic reality.
4455000	4456000	Maybe it's spiritual.
4456000	4457000	Maybe it's energy.
4457000	4464000	I mean, I will take then science as the most generalizable transcendent claims and I call it the energy information implicate order.
4464000	4465000	Okay.
4465000	4466000	We talked about what that is.
4466000	4472000	But anyway, then I, all of the personal gods were people like, Oh, my relationship break up and my God cares about me.
4472000	4475000	It's like, I'm, I'm fine for you to have that relation.
4475000	4481000	If we're going to talk about objective reality claims, man, that's skeptical and I don't have that.
4481000	4493000	And then, but at the same time, I really believe that the concept of God, I call till it kind of notion of an embrace of an ultimate concern, a frame of reference of an ultimate end point.
4493000	4501000	In fact, although it's not in this depiction, there's a thing inside that emerges over the garden called the elephant sun God.
4501000	4502000	Okay.
4502000	4506000	As an iconic representation of the elephant is of the blind men and the elephant.
4506000	4510000	It's also an old Hindu representation of a God of light.
4510000	4511000	Okay.
4511000	4513000	That we could see from a wide variety of different perspectives.
4513000	4529000	And it is the old, it symbolizes an iconic representation of an integrated pluralistic ultimate concern of value that would then create a liminal space of what the good is, meaning an imaginal possible space of what we project our ideals to be on.
4529000	4536000	And then try to organize our soul and spirit in relationship to so my soul is my unique way of being in the world.
4536000	4543000	I have a transcendent spirit and the iconic representation of the elephant sun God is my projection of what that ideal would be.
4543000	4547000	And then I use that as a sage like, you know, frame.
4547000	4556000	In other words, I put my imaginal sage to look down on me and then I place myself in wise relation to an imaginal sage that operates underneath the ideal.
4556000	4559000	And then through that I can then organize my soul and spirit.
4559000	4574000	And I believe that the human constitution, the psychic constitution really is remarkably surprisingly amazingly well organized to be organized that way.
4574000	4581000	So almost you could view you could view everything you're working on as a as a form of atheistic theology.
4581000	4596000	Targeted at the conceptions of the things that you're atheistic towards, but utilizing those conceptions for for a good, but a different good, which isn't tethered to monotheistic God.
4596000	4601000	It's a religion. That's not a religion for the back half of the 21st century.
4601000	4609000	I mean, no, I can see why academics would shy away from me. I mean, that's one hell of a vision.
4610000	4612000	So we're, we're
4616000	4620000	So what do you, what do you, I mean, I'm really interested. What do you see the immediate future being for it?
4620000	4625000	Is it making, is it making big strides at the moment?
4625000	4633000	I mean, I'm very happy with the strides I make and I'm connecting with a bunch of seers and interesting spaces in a wide variety of different.
4633000	4641000	There's a whole thing called a liminal web that I'm involved in and the you talk represents a particular thread.
4641000	4657000	And there are all their wide variety of different, I would call them a community of seers that are emerging that are concerned about the current state of the world and have developed a whole bunch of different possible angles on the kinds of ways in which we might consciously evolve.
4657000	4666000	And so I've now found my people in this regard. So there's a whole, the short one, if you have one word to put on, it's called meta modern.
4666000	4670000	Maybe that's the word I prefer. It's the thing that comes after postmodern.
4670000	4676000	So there's a whole collective sensibility of people that are wandering around with the thing that comes after postmodernism.
4676000	4679000	It synthesizes modernity and postmodernity.
4679000	4689000	So modernity says, oh, there's these truth claims and rationality, and that's all good. And then postmodernity says that's a bunch of white male patriarchy, and that created oppression of indigenous and marginalized peoples.
4689000	4697000	And then the meta modern says, of course, both those things are true. And then there's a thesis and antithesis and an effective synthesis and proper relation.
4697000	4704000	And then it's achieving that synthetics and sensibility is one way of framing the community I found.
4704000	4710000	And the unified theory of knowledge is totally a meta modern sensibility I didn't have a word at the time.
4710000	4714000	So I'm connecting with a subset of individuals and making connections.
4714000	4730000	And then I see this want to show that the unified theory is like this Rosetta stone that can take these very cool future visions, translate them and tie them together so it serves a particular golden thread in this tapestry weave of this emerging culture.
4730000	4736000	And my job right now is to consolidate the vision and connect it to the seers that are emerging.
4736000	4741000	And then also what I'm doing is I'm starting to really connect with the people that have pragmatic concerns.
4741000	4747000	Okay, the people that are much more grounded in the here and now and want to say, well, how do you have all those apples on that tree?
4747000	4752000	I want to bite off a few of them and make use out of it. Jesus, it looks like it's really brilliant. Can you help me?
4752000	4757000	And I'm like, okay, I'll work with you because you will be able to take that and translate it to your group.
4757000	4763000	And then if I get a lot of people that I'm working with that are doing the translation process and they can, I can learn from how to do that.
4763000	4774000	Then that gets to what I was saying earlier about these different zones of proximal development for different audiences that I can create courses or systematic processes by which people can learn how to digest.
4774000	4782000	So I'm connecting with the seers on the one hand and beginning the process of identifying audiences that foster the socialization into it.
4782000	4785000	And I'll be doing that for the next five, seven years or so.
4785000	4792000	So where can potential seers or people who are interested in this work find it?
4792000	4797000	Well, certainly UnifiedTheoryOfKnowledge.org is the homepage for it.
4797000	4803000	At the end there is the last is a listserv theory of knowledge society I founded.
4803000	4808000	And I'm going to shift this over to a newsletter soon, but I haven't done it yet.
4808000	4811000	There are about 200 people that are part of the theory of knowledge list.
4811000	4816000	If you suit me a note and I dialogue with you, I invite you to the theory of knowledge.
4816000	4820000	That's what it requires to get on the list and be a society member.
4820000	4824000	Then at the least you can start to dialogue with the community and stay in touch.
4824000	4826000	I can also send my Twitter handle.
4826000	4835000	If you just want to follow things like, you know, when I'm on podcasts and I do a unified, a you talking with Greg podcast every week where I bring people on and dialogue.
4835000	4843000	Of course, that's new talking play off the, you know, I do a lot of pun that way in relationship to meta language concepts.
4843000	4847000	So, and I give out freely my email.
4847000	4852000	I have endless numbers of conversations, hundreds of emails a day that I keep trying to try to keep track of.
4852000	4854000	I happen to dialogue with people out there.
4854000	4855000	Wow.
4855000	4858000	I, yeah, I think this is a great place to finish up.
4858000	4860000	We've covered the, we've covered the theory.
4860000	4861000	Everyone knows where to find it.
4861000	4869000	And sincerely, Greg, I sincerely wish you the best because, you know, I've met so many people over the past few years.
4869000	4879000	Who have these under under under undervalued undervalued theories under the undervalued things, which they're truly passionate about, which if they could just get the attention, right?
4879000	4882000	So I sincerely wish you the best.
4882000	4891000	Hey, man, I really appreciate the opportunity to the sound of what you guys are doing in terms of the kind of collective leveraging of economic attention in this digital age.
4891000	4899000	Those are exactly the kinds of necessary mechanisms that will be, you know, the leveraging systems that these ideas can then be connected with.
4899000	4902000	And it is a combination of those that will move us in the right direction.
4902000	4905000	So I have a huge amount of appreciation for what you guys are doing here.
4905000	4906000	Thanks very much.
4906000	4908000	Thank you.
4908000	4910000	All right.
