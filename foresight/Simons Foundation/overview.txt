1. Symbolic regression is part of a broader field called program synthesis, which aims to generate code that describes given data. Incorporating more complex operators or algorithms into symbolic regression could potentially improve its performance on high-dimensional problems. However, this remains a challenge and is an active area of research.

2. The question about algorithmic approaches in science, such as how to diagonalize a Hamiltonian, can indeed be incorporated into symbolic regression frameworks if designed properly. It's an engineering problem but conceptually feasible.

3. Pre-training a model on physical data, like using cap video data for predicting the motion of capillaries, often tends to improve performance rather than harm it. However, it's not guaranteed that pre-training is always beneficial, and there may be cases where it could negatively impact model learning.

4. Adversarial examples, as seen in machine learning with datasets like MNIST, exist even for human learners. In science, similar adversarial effects could occur where pre-training on certain data types might interfere with the learning process for a model trained to understand different concepts (e.g., models of the sun and DNA).

5. There are examples from language models where pre-training on diverse data, such as video data, can unexpectedly benefit performance in tasks that seem unrelated, like language understanding. This suggests that there may be transferable concepts between different domains within science.

6. While no adversarial examples have been found yet in the context of pre-training scientific models, it is expected that they will be discovered as research progresses. It's a field ripe for exploration and discovery.
