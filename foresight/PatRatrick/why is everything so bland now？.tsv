0	4560	Thank you to the Patreons for supporting this channel.
4560	9540	As someone who grew up in the early 2000s and witnessed in real time the launch of things
9540	15040	like YouTube and the social media boom, dined under the stained glass lamps at Pizza Hut,
15040	21600	traded Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon cards on the playground, and consumed a life-threatening amount of
21600	29080	strangely-died food items, I can't escape this feeling that everything has changed.
29080	34760	You could chalk it up to childhood nostalgia, or the realization of time floating along,
34760	41040	or maybe even a growing disdain for the systems at play and finally aging up into the world
41040	42600	to see the bigger picture.
42600	45080	I just don't think that's the case.
45080	51320	It seems like throughout my childhood, the world was going in a specific direction, and
51320	61400	at some point that force was just stopped and sent down a completely different rabbit hole.
61400	66600	Trying to pinpoint an exact moment this shift occurred seems impossible.
66600	80760	I guess one of the best places to start is Hollywood.
80760	85520	I remember being thoroughly engulfed in the Harry Potter franchise as a child.
85520	91680	Games, books, candy, toys, if it had a wizard on it, I wanted it.
91680	96320	There were several franchises that ate up all of our minds at the time, and while Harry
96320	101640	Potter was probably the first franchise I really remember loving as a child, a close
101640	107680	second had to be Spider-Man.
107680	111880	And with the Raimi films also coming out around that time, I was primed to grow into
111880	114240	a lifelong comic book nerd.
114240	120080	Luckily for me, my stepdad was already a full blown geek, and it just so happened that my
120080	126120	school was trying a new schedule, where we'd only have class for half a day on Wednesdays.
126120	129120	The day my stepdad also had off.
129120	133760	So with the remainder of our day left, we'd just hang out.
133760	139000	He'd show me old movie franchises that he loved, like Indiana Jones and Ghostbusters,
139000	144080	Star Wars or Rambo, and I would latch onto these series, quickly becoming a fan.
144080	148920	When new movies came out, we would frequently go watch them, like Batman Begins or Prisoner
148920	149920	of Azkaban.
149920	153920	In hindsight, it felt a lot like a generational crossover.
153920	157800	He'd grown up on these franchises and passed them along to me.
157800	162720	Now we're getting our own to share like Harry Potter and these new superhero films.
162720	168600	So imagine our elation, when in May of 2008, we would see the release of a brand new Indiana
168600	171960	Jones movie and an Iron Man movie.
171960	176640	And so we went and saw both of these movies in theaters, and for both of these movies,
176640	179720	we had a vastly different experience.
179720	181480	Iron Man was amazing.
181480	182760	We both loved it.
182760	188280	It felt gritty like Batman Begins, but still had this charm to it like the Raimi films
188280	191520	that felt true to both Tony Stark and Marvel.
191520	196160	Coming up as I normally do once the credits roll, my stepdad tells me to sit back down.
196160	201680	He'd heard from a co-worker that there's a special ending credits scene, so we sit
201680	202680	down.
202680	206720	Never having sat through the entire credits sequence in the movie theater, I realized
206720	208720	how long they actually were.
208720	214640	So I figured whatever was at the end of this had better be good, and it actually was.
214640	219840	The ending scene with Nick Fury and inviting Iron Man to the Avengers opened up this whole
219920	224400	can of worms and excitement for what other great stories could be told.
224400	227840	It was going to be a franchise, with more heroes on the way.
227840	232320	I was really excited to see how they'd expand on this mega franchise.
232320	234600	Would we get Galactus in the future?
234600	238960	Kang, what if those X-Men movies that have been coming out end up crossing over with
238960	239960	it?
239960	244080	I was simply overjoyed with how fresh and new this all seemed to be.
244080	248560	I was once again ready to eat up another franchise.
248560	254720	Now on the other side of the spectrum was Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
254720	258200	There was a bit of a different experience between me and my stepdad.
258200	263960	I remember him walking out just as disappointed as me, seeing one of your favorite series brought
263960	267280	back to life and smashed in front of you.
267280	271320	Little did I know that that would be a constant feeling in the future.
271320	273300	The whole movie felt off.
273300	277920	It seemed like it was brought back solely for the point of being able to say, hey, we brought
277920	278920	it back.
278920	280360	Wasn't that cool?
280360	286000	Well entirely missing the point of what made the franchise so drawing in the first place.
286000	289280	I don't know, something just felt off.
289280	293480	I remember an incredibly heavy toy rollout with this movie as well.
293480	299440	As I walked the toy aisle between the go-go crazy bones, the airhog havoc hellies, that
299440	303480	new Batmobile, I saw that shitty whip.
303480	309080	I felt like I was watching something I loved get its corpse dug up and paraded around,
309080	310520	all to make a quick buck.
310520	314040	This wasn't uncommon and still isn't today.
314040	318720	Literally everything that can be marketed towards kids will have cheap plastic garbage
318720	319720	made for them.
319720	325520	I mean, most of the 80s cartoons were built solely off of the principle of selling toys.
325520	330040	But it was the first time that I ever noticed it.
330040	336200	Fast forward to the present day and we have a 5th Indiana Jones movie that did the same
336200	337680	song and dance.
337680	344200	That little Marvel thing that I was so excited for is now up to 32 films with another 8 shows
344200	346840	that you just have to catch up on.
346840	349320	That should have been the dream, right?
349320	354760	And it was, for a while, before everything became so monotone.
354760	358680	Babe, wake up, it's time for your yearly Marvel rollout.
358680	362240	Babe, wake up, it's time to bring another franchise back from the day.
362240	366440	Babe, wake up, it's time for you to add a cute creature in a film to sell toys.
366440	371400	Babe, wake up, it's time to sit through the post-post credits.
371400	376840	There's been a growing sentiment that Hollywood is running out of ideas and from a surface
376840	379320	level it is very hard to argue.
379320	384800	Anytime something is mildly popular, it'll get mass produced to extinction.
384800	390360	However, some old IP will get dug up solely for, hey, remember this thing points?
390360	395800	It used to be cute, but now it seems all the Hollywood blockbusters are being mass produced
395800	401480	to appeal to the widest variety of people, making everything feel ultimately stale.
401480	406760	You can't stray too far into the source material or you may alienate casual viewers, can't
406760	412120	have a self-contained story, everything has to be this huge spectacle.
412120	415720	Don't even get me started on the commodification of all this.
415720	419520	You want to talk about cheap plastic garbage geared towards kids?
419520	424720	We've got that for adults now, in every imaginable thing they could possibly want.
424720	429480	Pick your fucking brand cause there's tons of them, most of them owned by the same company.
429480	434880	Crockpots, aprons, cat collars, chopsticks, you name it, they'll slap your favorite
434880	435880	IP on it.
435880	440160	It's so draining going into a store like Boxlunch anymore.
440160	445040	Really a monument to the whole trend of this is a forever IP.
445040	446040	Remember this thing?
446040	452000	Yeah, we're gonna milk it to death with the most mundane merch imaginable, which brings
452000	454120	me into my second point.
454120	464800	Everything is so boring to look at.
464800	469720	There's a reason why people have been so drawn to these Y2K aesthetics, like Frutiger
469720	475320	and its mini spinoffs, they're memorable, visually appealing and stuck out in a sea of
475320	476680	other designs.
476680	481560	Even exploring old angel firepages has a certain air of excitement to it that you will never
481560	484240	find on a modern web page today.
484240	489440	There's no more sticking out in a sea of designs, there's just the sea.
489440	494760	For example, I was talking to a friend about old lunchables, specifically the dessert pizza
494760	495760	ones.
495760	499880	I'm not questioning how I'd love the dessert pizzas, but I don't think they make them
499880	501760	anymore because I can never find them.
501760	507040	I did a little Google search and saw they do in fact still make them, but this packaging
507040	510680	is horrendous compared to the 2000s packaging.
510680	512680	Like I'm not crazy right?
512680	518080	Not even just from a personal perspective, but this is objectively a worse design for
518080	521560	a product geared towards children.
521560	525880	Like this one looks like something I would see on my grandma's metamucil.
525880	530160	Another example, Fierce Cola Competitors, Pepsi and Coke.
530160	532680	This is their 2000s design.
532680	538300	Pepsi has this rich blue, the logo is off-centered and the name is going vertically.
538300	542400	The can also features this almost ice cube design to it.
542400	548200	Coke on the other hand is sporting this shiny red can, with the label also vertical, but
548280	554440	it has these caramel lines running across the bottom with this floaty almost bubbly wave
554440	555760	pattern to it.
555760	561000	Both are incredibly simple in design, but are both uniquely their own style.
561000	565640	I don't even have to mention the cherry lineup that these guys had, because these are some
565640	569800	of the most memorable soft drink designs of all time.
569800	576560	Fast forward to today however, and do you want the red can or would you like the blue can?
576560	580640	That is basically the only difference you can make between the two.
580640	584680	There's almost no attempt to stand out in a crowd, aside from this color scheme and
584680	585680	logo.
585680	590800	I feel like this is why my eye is so heavily drawn to things like Mountain Dew.
590800	592760	That and I'm a fucking gamer.
592760	595120	I mean at least there's something going on there.
595120	599400	At least Mountain Dew treats me like I can comprehend more than just some logo and a
599400	600400	color scheme.
600400	604800	It's also a big part of why I think things like liquid death get so popular.
604800	610640	In a sea of bland corporate BS on shelves, if you can manage to get that shelving space
610640	614400	with them and look different people are going to be intrigued.
614400	616960	Bonus points if you like actually make a good product.
616960	622840	I could not fathom anyone preferring these minimalist designs on our products.
622840	624440	So who are they for?
624440	629680	Am I just looking way too deeply into something as mundane as the packaging our food comes
629680	630680	in?
630680	633680	Something most people probably don't even bat an eye at?
633680	640840	Maybe I just need to go outside, get off the internet for a little while and fuck me.
640840	644800	This homogenized look has even bled into architecture.
644800	649000	Remember the iconic red roof McDonald's used to have?
649000	651560	The adobe styling of Taco Bell.
651560	654280	That pizzeria feeling of Pizza Hut?
654280	657200	Or the sunroom in Wendy's?
657200	658680	Gone are those days.
658680	664240	Now they are all these sleek boxy monoliths to fast food.
664240	669240	Painted grey, white, black, or whatever the most drab color they could find.
669240	671920	The insides do not get much better either.
671920	677960	My McDonald's before its remodel used to have a genuinely cozy vibe for a McDonald's.
677960	680880	Now it is absolutely sterile.
680880	683840	Just like how all fast food restaurants now feel.
683840	690360	I'm not asking for rainforest cafe levels of ambiance, but the environment that's
690360	693800	been crafted here is just depressing.
693800	699880	And when your food is already depressing enough, choosing to eat in an environment like this
699880	700880	is horrible.
700880	708520	It's like it's been crafted to be the most cold, uncomfortable place to eat a meal in.
708520	709520	Functional?
709520	710520	Absolutely.
710520	715600	You can sit down and you can eat a meal here, but you don't want to be in here.
715600	721800	It feels like the company is actively trying to dissuade you from being in their establishment.
721800	728160	It feels like a new take on hostile architecture where it is absolutely hideous to look at
728160	735280	while still serving its function at the most basic level of say a bench or a chair.
735280	739720	But you won't be comfortable because it is designed to keep you away.
739720	746680	The thing is, Chipotle and Panda Express were using this exact design prior to the renaissance
746680	750080	of this drab interior deco.
750080	754800	But I never felt particularly cold eating at either of these restaurants.
754800	756080	So why is that?
756080	760440	Well, probably because the stores were designed like that from the start.
760440	766480	Scott Shipley, designer of Chipotle's stores had this to say about their thought process.
766480	768800	Our food is simple ingredients.
768880	770880	It's what you do with them that counts.
770880	776480	The idea with the architecture was let's take these simple rudimentary materials, but
776480	781160	what we do with them will say something and we'll get a look out of that.
781160	786600	When entering a restaurant that looks like this, at a time when other restaurants look
786600	793800	like this or this or this, it doesn't feel so sterile now, does it?
793800	797160	It's unique and exciting.
797160	799800	Kind of like a new superhero movie.
799800	805200	But after the 33rd time that you've seen a restaurant with this design completely stripped
805200	813040	from its source material, it starts to feel a little manufactured for you to like it without
813040	816040	understanding why it worked in the first place.
828920	834960	I've talked ad nauseam on this channel about internet nostalgia, but the web has changed
834960	838680	and that growth has directly affected the human race.
838680	841880	And a lot of us have seen that effect happen in real time.
841880	848040	This is before TikTok and Twitter bots, before the word meme was widespread, a simpler, more
848040	849960	wild west environment.
849960	853600	No one really knew where this thing was going, but it was exciting.
853600	856720	And once you experienced it, you were pulled in.
856720	862320	You can't place the blame on what the internet has become on one person or one company, but
862320	868920	I can confidently say giving this guy the reins for so long was not the right move.
868920	873240	Let's go over an extended and very crude history lesson.
873240	877240	In the 1980s, people were using computers like this.
877240	883720	Doing, I don't know, boring office work, nerdy stuff, trying to play Leisure Suit Larry.
883720	886680	Point is, not a lot of people were using computers.
886680	892400	You had businessmen, working class citizens, and the really fringe nerds.
892400	897240	Computers were expensive, hard to navigate, and a lot of people weren't sure of the applications
897240	898240	yet.
898240	904200	Throughout the turn of the decade, computers started to get a lot faster and a lot cheaper,
904200	908160	all due to developments in the manufacturing of microchips.
908160	913680	Not only that, all this new power allowed for computers to go from looking like this,
913680	914780	to this.
914780	918920	The ease of access had been figured out, and now you're seeing families not only getting
918920	922120	home computers, but also getting dial-up internet.
922120	927240	And by 1995, we got the greatest piece of technology ever released.
928240	930040	And no, that isn't a joke.
930040	933200	I die for this dog, and I don't care what you think.
933200	937080	Also, Windows 1995 was rather notable too, I suppose.
937080	942800	Seriously revamping the user interface, adding key features like the start button and the
942800	944200	task bar.
944200	948920	This marks a point where these manufacturers and the internet as a whole really wanted
948920	953560	to show you what it was capable of, a sentiment that would follow in the coming years.
953560	959760	In 1995, only 0.4% of the world's population was on the internet.
959760	964920	And in the time between the turn of the millennia, we'd see things like AuctionNet, a totally
964920	969680	online open marketplace for people to place bids in real time.
969680	975640	A small, probably irrelevant program called Future Splash Animator was released.
975640	981000	Oh shit, it just got bought up by Macromedia, you know, hitmaker of Shockwave, and they're
981000	983920	calling it Macromedia Flash.
983920	986760	I'm sure a name change like that won't happen again.
986760	992800	GeoCities and Angel Fire, services that made creating your own personal websites a lot easier,
992800	997560	giving users the power and creative freedom to host whatever they wanted.
997560	1003360	Then you had Six Degrees, which is widely regarded as being the first social media,
1003360	1006200	implementing things like friendsless and direct messaging.
1006200	1013760	And by 1988, a little thing you've probably heard of, Google, and in 1999, AuctionNet had
1013760	1021360	transformed into what we know as eBay, and had facilitated around $7.2 million worth
1021360	1022360	of sales.
1022360	1026160	Remember that 0.4% in 1995?
1026160	1034320	Well by January of 2000, that number had jumped to a whopping 4% of the world's population
1034320	1035760	surfing the net.
1035760	1039800	With 52% of Americans having access to the internet.
1039800	1044040	You know, this whole Macromedia Flash thing is getting pretty popular.
1044040	1047680	In fact, it is the most popular plugin on the internet.
1047680	1053600	Oh look, a whole thriving site that's been brewing in the background dedicated to it.
1053600	1058640	It's really popular, like one of the most active user bases on the internet popular.
1058640	1063880	It's safe to say by the 2000s that this whole internet thing was really breaking new
1063880	1064880	grounds.
1064880	1070040	No, literally, the dotcom bubble just happened, fuck somebody go check on new grounds.
1070040	1075640	Yeah, all that money and steam from the past few years just went down the drain.
1075640	1080160	Around $5 trillion and some really notable companies down the drain.
1080160	1086080	Hopefully this doesn't lead to any power vacuums in the future.
1086080	1090160	Y'all have your time, we've got an internet to build.
1090160	1097880	2002 to 2010 is what I like to describe as the, if you let them build it, they will come
1097880	1099560	era of the internet.
1099560	1105920	2002 we get the rise of Friendster, the first truly successful social media site, implementing
1105920	1111480	some customization and dating app features that its competitor would soon shortly rip
1111480	1112480	off.
1112480	1117240	MySpace took a lot of Friendster's designs and through some gorilla marketing ended up
1117240	1123560	dethroning Friendster with customizable profiles, ranking your top 8 friends, auto playing music
1123560	1128360	tracks on your page, and to its detriment, many many more features.
1128360	1134080	What GeoCities and Angelfire did by giving users a page of their own, MySpace perfected
1134080	1137640	this time with the added layer of network ability.
1137640	1142960	2004 sees the launch of a familiar face coming up for that throne, Facebook, but they're
1142960	1144400	not quite significant yet.
1144400	1147920	The next year, 2005 seems to be a pretty pivotal year.
1147920	1154440	We see Adobe acquiring Macromedia for our final name change of that hit technology,
1154440	1159440	Adobe Flash, the same year we get YouTube, a website I'm sure you know because you're
1159440	1160440	on it.
1160440	1166960	The Xbox 360, which I'd argue is the first console to fully utilize and get its players
1166960	1170240	on board with the idea of online gameplay.
1170240	1175800	I'd say largely due to the fact that 2005 also marks a turn in how Americans access
1175800	1176800	the internet.
1176800	1180880	Being the first year, broadband internet use overtook dial-up.
1180880	1186840	Now, more of us had access to this never-ending supply of content being brought our way.
1186840	1188280	Videos are loading in minutes.
1188280	1190400	Games are more accessible online.
1190400	1195280	No longer do we have to worry about somebody using the phone while we are surfing the web.
1195280	1198680	Just infinite, unlimited browsing.
1198680	1202440	The next five years are really just a rise in all of this content.
1202440	1206840	YouTube continues to grow into this platform where anyone can upload whatever they want.
1206840	1211480	Newground sees some of its greatest years between 2005 and 2007.
1211480	1215880	Twitter is launched as this alternate social media site where you can just scream into
1215880	1219000	the void of the world with whatever you want to say.
1219000	1223360	And you have Reddit who is taking inspirations from other web forms, allowing users to create
1223360	1226720	their own boards to talk about whatever they feel like.
1226720	1231480	Only atheism and what the fuck Reddit.
1231480	1238200	Reddit's earlier years screamed a lot more 4chan than its modern day variant.
1238200	1243000	And speaking of 4chan, these were some of its earliest influential years from uploading
1243000	1249080	a scan from a comic book in 2008 that would morph internet culture till this current day.
1249080	1253040	4chan was always seen as sort of this breeding ground for internet culture.
1253040	1256840	A picture that would spread throughout other sites like YouTube and Reddit and Myspace
1256840	1258720	and even into the real world.
1258720	1263840	These spaces inhabited by a younger generation started to feel like they were growing and
1263840	1266640	developing into a place for all of us.
1266640	1269520	A place where we were the providers of the entertainment.
1269520	1274200	The design of the page, the contents held within it, and the humor we found funny.
1274200	1279480	I bring on this up to paint a picture of the timeline and both the Wild West state that
1279480	1280920	the internet had been in.
1280920	1285560	You have the older generations who set up this internet thing with the fundamentals of
1285560	1292040	hey, this is a place for you, you can be anyone you want on here, and if you can make it,
1292040	1293040	you can share it.
1293040	1294840	These were the so called rules.
1294840	1300000	And now with the accessibility of the internet across America and some incredibly wise peers
1300000	1305560	with the same fundamentals, it was our turn to make our stake on this whole internet thing.
1305680	1307800	However, there comes a turning point.
1307800	1312160	This freedom and all this new traffic coming online has a cost.
1312160	1316360	As the numbers go up, so does the need to find a stream of revenue to keep this whole
1316360	1317360	thing afloat.
1317360	1320320	It's simply the cost of doing business.
1320320	1325280	Most users are fine with seeing an ad here or there, but for Myspace it might have been
1325280	1327280	their final nail in the coffin.
1327280	1333040	Myspace while having the beautiful customization many users had grown to love and expect from
1333040	1337240	the internet had also been dealing with countless issues on the site.
1337240	1342680	From buggy apps, broken features and just the general clunkiness the site had morphed
1342680	1343680	into.
1343680	1348440	Compound this with security threats and revenue goals the site needed to meet, now being owned
1348440	1351920	by a massive corporation, Time Inc.
1351920	1355800	Ads became more intrusive and a bid to monetize the site.
1355800	1363600	Many users started to hop over to the sleek, uniformly designed and feature rich Facebook.
1363600	1369360	And by 2008, Facebook had dethroned Myspace as the number one social media site.
1369360	1375400	Facebook seems like this new exciting thing and everyone is just moving over in hordes
1375400	1379840	with fun features like poking your friends and of course the wall.
1379840	1385760	Bringing all of your friends posts right there to you in an easily digestible format.
1385760	1390400	Everything is very accessible and simplified, it's great.
1390400	1394720	But I don't know, there does seem to be a lack of personality to your pages now.
1394720	1397360	I'm sure it'll come down the road though, right?
1397360	1401840	Surely this style of oversimplified design won't take over the internet.
1401840	1407160	There's no way that Facebook will morph into the most influential tech company imaginable
1407160	1411280	with every other major corporation following in its footsteps.
1411280	1414480	Feeling comfortable with no customization at all?
1414560	1419520	Hell, we'd be lucky if we don't get banned for saying a naughty word on their site.
1419520	1420840	They wouldn't do that to us.
1420840	1425280	They wouldn't do that to the kids who's content built their site, right?
1435360	1439360	That last section may have seemed like I was going on a tangent,
1439360	1444000	but I really wanted you to understand the history and how many building blocks
1444000	1449360	were leading to the internet being this always uniquely user driven thing.
1449360	1453680	Just solely off the customization options we have today is enough to feel like
1453680	1455920	everything is a carbon copy of itself.
1455920	1459200	YouTube that used to allow fully customizable backgrounds
1459200	1462560	now has been boiled down to profile picture?
1462560	1463120	Banner.
1463120	1468080	Facebook being the replacement for MySpace which was probably one of the most customizable
1468080	1469920	social media sites we'll ever see.
1469920	1470800	Profile picture.
1471600	1472240	Banner.
1472240	1472640	Twitter.
1473440	1474320	Profile picture.
1474880	1475680	Banner.
1475680	1476080	Reddit.
1476800	1477920	Profile picture.
1477920	1478720	Banner.
1478720	1482720	And I mean I'll give it to Reddit, they at least have these little avatars which are kind of
1482720	1487120	customizable but they still just give off that Funko Pop feeling.
1487120	1491440	Speaking of feeling, all of these sites functionally act the same.
1491440	1496400	No more crawling the web, instead you just scroll from one app until it's boring
1496400	1497760	and then scroll through another.
1497760	1502480	Every website is essentially the same song and dance of going down your timeline.
1502480	1505920	Oh well that's just the most optimal way to scroll.
1505920	1510480	Sure whatever, it definitely doesn't have anything to do with Facebook forcing ads into
1510480	1512320	your timeline in 2012.
1512320	1517680	An immensely controversial move at the time which likely in turn made them millions.
1517680	1519600	Let's run a little experiment here.
1519600	1525120	Open your phone, choose your favorite social media site and scroll until you've gotten fed an ad.
1525120	1532480	I'm willing to guess you didn't get 8 posts deep before you saw either promoted or a sponsored post.
1533120	1539520	This commodification of the internet is very reminiscent of every other aspect in our lives.
1539520	1541600	Okay well they've got to make money somehow.
1541600	1546320	You could always pay for one of the ad free services that are provided if you really hate
1546320	1547520	the ad so much.
1547520	1552160	And at the end of the day it's really the content on these platforms that matters.
1552160	1553840	So let's talk about the content.
1553920	1554960	Starting with YouTube.
1554960	1559520	Once a powerhouse to creators who just wanted to post something online.
1559520	1566560	Creating stars out of those who wanted to make films, skits, or even run their own show.
1566560	1571360	Giving anyone with a creative drive their chance to be seen by an audience without the
1571360	1573520	restraints you'd see in corporate television.
1573520	1580480	The authenticity and grit of few people's creative expressions has morphed into anything
1580480	1581680	but this sentiment.
1581680	1588240	The lifeblood of the site has quickly changed from quirky kids in their bedrooms to multifaceted
1588240	1594640	teams working day in and day out to bring together the most universally appealing content.
1594640	1596800	This takes on its own kind of being.
1596800	1602560	Creating carbon clones of itself to be copied and pasted across other social media sites.
1602560	1606400	Have you ever felt like YouTube has gotten stale in that regard?
1606400	1612400	My Gen X mother watches MrBeast clips that have been recycled onto Facebook.
1612400	1617440	Tell me in what world she'd be watching YouTuber's former king PewDiePie.
1617440	1622320	And there's an argument there that the whole let's play era of content was also just copy
1622320	1623040	and pasted.
1623040	1628720	Whatever game was the flavor that weak is what would be played by every single channel.
1628720	1633440	The only difference was it still wasn't at that mass appeal that we see content today.
1633440	1638640	It feels like everything that gets attention is meant to get attention from every other
1638640	1639840	platform as well.
1639840	1645040	Becoming this homogenized content regardless of what application you're using.
1645040	1649120	The delivery of all this content is also fed to us through a funnel.
1649120	1655920	Some supercomputer is gathering our watch time, our data, our interests and spitting out what
1655920	1657760	it thinks we want.
1658400	1664800	The things we consume online aren't even chosen by us, but artificially gifted by the
1664800	1665680	algorithm.
1665680	1669280	You ever notice how bad search functionality has gotten?
1669280	1671440	Specifically on YouTube and Google.
1671440	1675280	Whatever you're searching for isn't easily found anymore.
1675280	1680560	You might get a few relative results, but then you'll be shown things completely removed
1680560	1682880	from what you were looking for.
1683200	1693840	And Google's newest addition, something that is plaguing the internet right now in general,
1693840	1696720	the integration of AI.
1701840	1706640	If all these things didn't make you feel like the world around us was artificially produced
1706640	1712640	and some bid to either win our attention or win our money, then the introduction of
1712640	1717360	literal artificial life and technology might do that to you.
1717360	1720960	You ever just scroll through TikTok and get shown something like this?
1727760	1732880	Not only is it the Milk Toast broad uphill content we talked about in the previous section,
1732880	1735120	but now it's not even human.
1735120	1739120	There's not somebody at least trying to be an entertaining host.
1739120	1741680	It's just some robot trying to mimic that.
1741680	1746720	Every time I see something like this, I get this sinking feeling that we are surely coming
1746720	1750240	to a close of this whole internet thing being ours.
1750240	1755040	There's posts like this throughout all of the web, with literal bot farms on these things
1755040	1757360	just running day in and day out.
1757360	1762800	The most horrifying example being those that run on Facebook, producing these AI-generated
1762800	1767520	photos of Jesus getting increasingly more bizarre and incomprehensible,
1767520	1769520	but doing literal numbers.
1769520	1773040	Not only because boomers are kind of stupid and eat this shit up,
1773040	1779280	but now there's these AI accounts that are supposed to be posing as users eating up this content.
1779280	1785440	The dead internet theory has become all but a theory really and just kind of looks like our future.
1785440	1790240	The worst part of all this, AI isn't some tool locked behind a corporate level paywall.
1790240	1795760	Facebook isn't putting these bots out here to make the site feel more lively and have more content.
1795760	1800080	AI technology is practically free for any of us to use,
1800080	1805280	and that seems to be who's propagating it the most online for some reason or another.
1805280	1806480	It's just us.
1806480	1810560	We're still in a fairly primordial stage of all of this, I'd say.
1810560	1816080	These bots can be recognized, the songs can be heard, the photos can be dissected,
1816080	1820400	all pointing to this thing we're experiencing being artificial.
1820400	1823200	But what happens when that isn't the case anymore?
1823200	1827920	We've opened Pandora's box, and there's no going back from this technology.
1827920	1831440	What happens when we can't tell who in the Twitter thread is a bot?
1831440	1837520	We can't tell if the song we're listening to is a genuine artist who spent years of their life
1837520	1844400	honing their craft and is instead someone who spent a couple weeks with an AI model to fabricate this song.
1844400	1848400	Not only are we being guided through the content we consume by an AI,
1848400	1853920	but we're about to start getting shown undistinguishable content produced by an AI.
1853920	1859440	Artificial intelligence makes everything seem less real because it controls how we interact,
1859440	1862160	and it does creative tasks automatically.
1862160	1865840	As AI starts to control more of what we do and see online,
1865840	1871280	it makes us wonder what's genuine and makes the world around us feel even less real.
1871280	1876560	If you needed a better example, that quote was literally written by ChatGPT.
1876560	1882000	If you've been experiencing this feeling that the world around us is growing more artificial,
1882000	1887120	like myself, the integration of artificial intelligence is only going to make this worse.
1887120	1892400	The internet seems to be longer moved from the days of being something to connect us all,
1892400	1898320	and with the introduction of bots that we won't be able to tell apart from real genuine people,
1898320	1904000	losing that feeling of individuality online, and almost everything we consume online being
1904000	1912160	fed to us directly by some computer, deciding this is what we like, rather than what we actually like,
1912160	1916240	or what we're feeling. It's a grim outlook for sure.
1916240	1921840	I mean, speaking back to fast food, certain stores have begun integrating AI ordering menus.
1921840	1926560	I have a McDonald's a few miles away from me that is strictly automated,
1926560	1931680	very little human interaction. The employees are basically just in the back making the food,
1931680	1937440	completely void from the customers. When you start removing humans from the human experience,
1938000	1944160	especially in things that could only exist because of humans, everything you interact with
1944160	1950240	just seems manufactured. I didn't set out for this video to have such a doomer vibe to it,
1950240	1954560	and I really hope it didn't come off that way. I was really just trying to get
1954560	1958880	down to the root of my feelings on why I'd felt the world had changed,
1958880	1963440	and if the world around you seems to be growing more artificial and changing,
1963440	1967600	perhaps the best thing you can do is get to the root of those feelings.
1968160	1972800	That and you could always plant some strawberries and watch them grow like I have.
1975520	1984400	Thank you for watching.
