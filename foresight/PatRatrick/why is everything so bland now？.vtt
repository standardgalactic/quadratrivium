00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
Thank you to the Patreons for supporting this channel.

00:04.560 --> 00:09.540
As someone who grew up in the early 2000s and witnessed in real time the launch of things

00:09.540 --> 00:15.040
like YouTube and the social media boom, dined under the stained glass lamps at Pizza Hut,

00:15.040 --> 00:21.600
traded Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon cards on the playground, and consumed a life-threatening amount of

00:21.600 --> 00:29.080
strangely-died food items, I can't escape this feeling that everything has changed.

00:29.080 --> 00:34.760
You could chalk it up to childhood nostalgia, or the realization of time floating along,

00:34.760 --> 00:41.040
or maybe even a growing disdain for the systems at play and finally aging up into the world

00:41.040 --> 00:42.600
to see the bigger picture.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.080
I just don't think that's the case.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.320
It seems like throughout my childhood, the world was going in a specific direction, and

00:51.320 --> 01:01.400
at some point that force was just stopped and sent down a completely different rabbit hole.

01:01.400 --> 01:06.600
Trying to pinpoint an exact moment this shift occurred seems impossible.

01:06.600 --> 01:20.760
I guess one of the best places to start is Hollywood.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.520
I remember being thoroughly engulfed in the Harry Potter franchise as a child.

01:25.520 --> 01:31.680
Games, books, candy, toys, if it had a wizard on it, I wanted it.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.320
There were several franchises that ate up all of our minds at the time, and while Harry

01:36.320 --> 01:41.640
Potter was probably the first franchise I really remember loving as a child, a close

01:41.640 --> 01:47.680
second had to be Spider-Man.

01:47.680 --> 01:51.880
And with the Raimi films also coming out around that time, I was primed to grow into

01:51.880 --> 01:54.240
a lifelong comic book nerd.

01:54.240 --> 02:00.080
Luckily for me, my stepdad was already a full blown geek, and it just so happened that my

02:00.080 --> 02:06.120
school was trying a new schedule, where we'd only have class for half a day on Wednesdays.

02:06.120 --> 02:09.120
The day my stepdad also had off.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.760
So with the remainder of our day left, we'd just hang out.

02:13.760 --> 02:19.000
He'd show me old movie franchises that he loved, like Indiana Jones and Ghostbusters,

02:19.000 --> 02:24.080
Star Wars or Rambo, and I would latch onto these series, quickly becoming a fan.

02:24.080 --> 02:28.920
When new movies came out, we would frequently go watch them, like Batman Begins or Prisoner

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
of Azkaban.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.920
In hindsight, it felt a lot like a generational crossover.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.800
He'd grown up on these franchises and passed them along to me.

02:37.800 --> 02:42.720
Now we're getting our own to share like Harry Potter and these new superhero films.

02:42.720 --> 02:48.600
So imagine our elation, when in May of 2008, we would see the release of a brand new Indiana

02:48.600 --> 02:51.960
Jones movie and an Iron Man movie.

02:51.960 --> 02:56.640
And so we went and saw both of these movies in theaters, and for both of these movies,

02:56.640 --> 02:59.720
we had a vastly different experience.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.480
Iron Man was amazing.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.760
We both loved it.

03:02.760 --> 03:08.280
It felt gritty like Batman Begins, but still had this charm to it like the Raimi films

03:08.280 --> 03:11.520
that felt true to both Tony Stark and Marvel.

03:11.520 --> 03:16.160
Coming up as I normally do once the credits roll, my stepdad tells me to sit back down.

03:16.160 --> 03:21.680
He'd heard from a co-worker that there's a special ending credits scene, so we sit

03:21.680 --> 03:22.680
down.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.720
Never having sat through the entire credits sequence in the movie theater, I realized

03:26.720 --> 03:28.720
how long they actually were.

03:28.720 --> 03:34.640
So I figured whatever was at the end of this had better be good, and it actually was.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.840
The ending scene with Nick Fury and inviting Iron Man to the Avengers opened up this whole

03:39.920 --> 03:44.400
can of worms and excitement for what other great stories could be told.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.840
It was going to be a franchise, with more heroes on the way.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.320
I was really excited to see how they'd expand on this mega franchise.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.600
Would we get Galactus in the future?

03:54.600 --> 03:58.960
Kang, what if those X-Men movies that have been coming out end up crossing over with

03:58.960 --> 03:59.960
it?

03:59.960 --> 04:04.080
I was simply overjoyed with how fresh and new this all seemed to be.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.560
I was once again ready to eat up another franchise.

04:08.560 --> 04:14.720
Now on the other side of the spectrum was Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.200
There was a bit of a different experience between me and my stepdad.

04:18.200 --> 04:23.960
I remember him walking out just as disappointed as me, seeing one of your favorite series brought

04:23.960 --> 04:27.280
back to life and smashed in front of you.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.320
Little did I know that that would be a constant feeling in the future.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.300
The whole movie felt off.

04:33.300 --> 04:37.920
It seemed like it was brought back solely for the point of being able to say, hey, we brought

04:37.920 --> 04:38.920
it back.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.360
Wasn't that cool?

04:40.360 --> 04:46.000
Well entirely missing the point of what made the franchise so drawing in the first place.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.280
I don't know, something just felt off.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.480
I remember an incredibly heavy toy rollout with this movie as well.

04:53.480 --> 04:59.440
As I walked the toy aisle between the go-go crazy bones, the airhog havoc hellies, that

04:59.440 --> 05:03.480
new Batmobile, I saw that shitty whip.

05:03.480 --> 05:09.080
I felt like I was watching something I loved get its corpse dug up and paraded around,

05:09.080 --> 05:10.520
all to make a quick buck.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.040
This wasn't uncommon and still isn't today.

05:14.040 --> 05:18.720
Literally everything that can be marketed towards kids will have cheap plastic garbage

05:18.720 --> 05:19.720
made for them.

05:19.720 --> 05:25.520
I mean, most of the 80s cartoons were built solely off of the principle of selling toys.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.040
But it was the first time that I ever noticed it.

05:30.040 --> 05:36.200
Fast forward to the present day and we have a 5th Indiana Jones movie that did the same

05:36.200 --> 05:37.680
song and dance.

05:37.680 --> 05:44.200
That little Marvel thing that I was so excited for is now up to 32 films with another 8 shows

05:44.200 --> 05:46.840
that you just have to catch up on.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.320
That should have been the dream, right?

05:49.320 --> 05:54.760
And it was, for a while, before everything became so monotone.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.680
Babe, wake up, it's time for your yearly Marvel rollout.

05:58.680 --> 06:02.240
Babe, wake up, it's time to bring another franchise back from the day.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.440
Babe, wake up, it's time for you to add a cute creature in a film to sell toys.

06:06.440 --> 06:11.400
Babe, wake up, it's time to sit through the post-post credits.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.840
There's been a growing sentiment that Hollywood is running out of ideas and from a surface

06:16.840 --> 06:19.320
level it is very hard to argue.

06:19.320 --> 06:24.800
Anytime something is mildly popular, it'll get mass produced to extinction.

06:24.800 --> 06:30.360
However, some old IP will get dug up solely for, hey, remember this thing points?

06:30.360 --> 06:35.800
It used to be cute, but now it seems all the Hollywood blockbusters are being mass produced

06:35.800 --> 06:41.480
to appeal to the widest variety of people, making everything feel ultimately stale.

06:41.480 --> 06:46.760
You can't stray too far into the source material or you may alienate casual viewers, can't

06:46.760 --> 06:52.120
have a self-contained story, everything has to be this huge spectacle.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.720
Don't even get me started on the commodification of all this.

06:55.720 --> 06:59.520
You want to talk about cheap plastic garbage geared towards kids?

06:59.520 --> 07:04.720
We've got that for adults now, in every imaginable thing they could possibly want.

07:04.720 --> 07:09.480
Pick your fucking brand cause there's tons of them, most of them owned by the same company.

07:09.480 --> 07:14.880
Crockpots, aprons, cat collars, chopsticks, you name it, they'll slap your favorite

07:14.880 --> 07:15.880
IP on it.

07:15.880 --> 07:20.160
It's so draining going into a store like Boxlunch anymore.

07:20.160 --> 07:25.040
Really a monument to the whole trend of this is a forever IP.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.040
Remember this thing?

07:26.040 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, we're gonna milk it to death with the most mundane merch imaginable, which brings

07:32.000 --> 07:34.120
me into my second point.

07:34.120 --> 07:44.800
Everything is so boring to look at.

07:44.800 --> 07:49.720
There's a reason why people have been so drawn to these Y2K aesthetics, like Frutiger

07:49.720 --> 07:55.320
and its mini spinoffs, they're memorable, visually appealing and stuck out in a sea of

07:55.320 --> 07:56.680
other designs.

07:56.680 --> 08:01.560
Even exploring old angel firepages has a certain air of excitement to it that you will never

08:01.560 --> 08:04.240
find on a modern web page today.

08:04.240 --> 08:09.440
There's no more sticking out in a sea of designs, there's just the sea.

08:09.440 --> 08:14.760
For example, I was talking to a friend about old lunchables, specifically the dessert pizza

08:14.760 --> 08:15.760
ones.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.880
I'm not questioning how I'd love the dessert pizzas, but I don't think they make them

08:19.880 --> 08:21.760
anymore because I can never find them.

08:21.760 --> 08:27.040
I did a little Google search and saw they do in fact still make them, but this packaging

08:27.040 --> 08:30.680
is horrendous compared to the 2000s packaging.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.680
Like I'm not crazy right?

08:32.680 --> 08:38.080
Not even just from a personal perspective, but this is objectively a worse design for

08:38.080 --> 08:41.560
a product geared towards children.

08:41.560 --> 08:45.880
Like this one looks like something I would see on my grandma's metamucil.

08:45.880 --> 08:50.160
Another example, Fierce Cola Competitors, Pepsi and Coke.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.680
This is their 2000s design.

08:52.680 --> 08:58.300
Pepsi has this rich blue, the logo is off-centered and the name is going vertically.

08:58.300 --> 09:02.400
The can also features this almost ice cube design to it.

09:02.400 --> 09:08.200
Coke on the other hand is sporting this shiny red can, with the label also vertical, but

09:08.280 --> 09:14.440
it has these caramel lines running across the bottom with this floaty almost bubbly wave

09:14.440 --> 09:15.760
pattern to it.

09:15.760 --> 09:21.000
Both are incredibly simple in design, but are both uniquely their own style.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.640
I don't even have to mention the cherry lineup that these guys had, because these are some

09:25.640 --> 09:29.800
of the most memorable soft drink designs of all time.

09:29.800 --> 09:36.560
Fast forward to today however, and do you want the red can or would you like the blue can?

09:36.560 --> 09:40.640
That is basically the only difference you can make between the two.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.680
There's almost no attempt to stand out in a crowd, aside from this color scheme and

09:44.680 --> 09:45.680
logo.

09:45.680 --> 09:50.800
I feel like this is why my eye is so heavily drawn to things like Mountain Dew.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.760
That and I'm a fucking gamer.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.120
I mean at least there's something going on there.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.400
At least Mountain Dew treats me like I can comprehend more than just some logo and a

09:59.400 --> 10:00.400
color scheme.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.800
It's also a big part of why I think things like liquid death get so popular.

10:04.800 --> 10:10.640
In a sea of bland corporate BS on shelves, if you can manage to get that shelving space

10:10.640 --> 10:14.400
with them and look different people are going to be intrigued.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.960
Bonus points if you like actually make a good product.

10:16.960 --> 10:22.840
I could not fathom anyone preferring these minimalist designs on our products.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.440
So who are they for?

10:24.440 --> 10:29.680
Am I just looking way too deeply into something as mundane as the packaging our food comes

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
in?

10:30.680 --> 10:33.680
Something most people probably don't even bat an eye at?

10:33.680 --> 10:40.840
Maybe I just need to go outside, get off the internet for a little while and fuck me.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.800
This homogenized look has even bled into architecture.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.000
Remember the iconic red roof McDonald's used to have?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.560
The adobe styling of Taco Bell.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.280
That pizzeria feeling of Pizza Hut?

10:54.280 --> 10:57.200
Or the sunroom in Wendy's?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.680
Gone are those days.

10:58.680 --> 11:04.240
Now they are all these sleek boxy monoliths to fast food.

11:04.240 --> 11:09.240
Painted grey, white, black, or whatever the most drab color they could find.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.920
The insides do not get much better either.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.960
My McDonald's before its remodel used to have a genuinely cozy vibe for a McDonald's.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.880
Now it is absolutely sterile.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.840
Just like how all fast food restaurants now feel.

11:23.840 --> 11:30.360
I'm not asking for rainforest cafe levels of ambiance, but the environment that's

11:30.360 --> 11:33.800
been crafted here is just depressing.

11:33.800 --> 11:39.880
And when your food is already depressing enough, choosing to eat in an environment like this

11:39.880 --> 11:40.880
is horrible.

11:40.880 --> 11:48.520
It's like it's been crafted to be the most cold, uncomfortable place to eat a meal in.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.520
Functional?

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
Absolutely.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.600
You can sit down and you can eat a meal here, but you don't want to be in here.

11:55.600 --> 12:01.800
It feels like the company is actively trying to dissuade you from being in their establishment.

12:01.800 --> 12:08.160
It feels like a new take on hostile architecture where it is absolutely hideous to look at

12:08.160 --> 12:15.280
while still serving its function at the most basic level of say a bench or a chair.

12:15.280 --> 12:19.720
But you won't be comfortable because it is designed to keep you away.

12:19.720 --> 12:26.680
The thing is, Chipotle and Panda Express were using this exact design prior to the renaissance

12:26.680 --> 12:30.080
of this drab interior deco.

12:30.080 --> 12:34.800
But I never felt particularly cold eating at either of these restaurants.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.080
So why is that?

12:36.080 --> 12:40.440
Well, probably because the stores were designed like that from the start.

12:40.440 --> 12:46.480
Scott Shipley, designer of Chipotle's stores had this to say about their thought process.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.800
Our food is simple ingredients.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.880
It's what you do with them that counts.

12:50.880 --> 12:56.480
The idea with the architecture was let's take these simple rudimentary materials, but

12:56.480 --> 13:01.160
what we do with them will say something and we'll get a look out of that.

13:01.160 --> 13:06.600
When entering a restaurant that looks like this, at a time when other restaurants look

13:06.600 --> 13:13.800
like this or this or this, it doesn't feel so sterile now, does it?

13:13.800 --> 13:17.160
It's unique and exciting.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.800
Kind of like a new superhero movie.

13:19.800 --> 13:25.200
But after the 33rd time that you've seen a restaurant with this design completely stripped

13:25.200 --> 13:33.040
from its source material, it starts to feel a little manufactured for you to like it without

13:33.040 --> 13:36.040
understanding why it worked in the first place.

13:48.920 --> 13:54.960
I've talked ad nauseam on this channel about internet nostalgia, but the web has changed

13:54.960 --> 13:58.680
and that growth has directly affected the human race.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.880
And a lot of us have seen that effect happen in real time.

14:01.880 --> 14:08.040
This is before TikTok and Twitter bots, before the word meme was widespread, a simpler, more

14:08.040 --> 14:09.960
wild west environment.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.600
No one really knew where this thing was going, but it was exciting.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.720
And once you experienced it, you were pulled in.

14:16.720 --> 14:22.320
You can't place the blame on what the internet has become on one person or one company, but

14:22.320 --> 14:28.920
I can confidently say giving this guy the reins for so long was not the right move.

14:28.920 --> 14:33.240
Let's go over an extended and very crude history lesson.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.240
In the 1980s, people were using computers like this.

14:37.240 --> 14:43.720
Doing, I don't know, boring office work, nerdy stuff, trying to play Leisure Suit Larry.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.680
Point is, not a lot of people were using computers.

14:46.680 --> 14:52.400
You had businessmen, working class citizens, and the really fringe nerds.

14:52.400 --> 14:57.240
Computers were expensive, hard to navigate, and a lot of people weren't sure of the applications

14:57.240 --> 14:58.240
yet.

14:58.240 --> 15:04.200
Throughout the turn of the decade, computers started to get a lot faster and a lot cheaper,

15:04.200 --> 15:08.160
all due to developments in the manufacturing of microchips.

15:08.160 --> 15:13.680
Not only that, all this new power allowed for computers to go from looking like this,

15:13.680 --> 15:14.780
to this.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.920
The ease of access had been figured out, and now you're seeing families not only getting

15:18.920 --> 15:22.120
home computers, but also getting dial-up internet.

15:22.120 --> 15:27.240
And by 1995, we got the greatest piece of technology ever released.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.040
And no, that isn't a joke.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.200
I die for this dog, and I don't care what you think.

15:33.200 --> 15:37.080
Also, Windows 1995 was rather notable too, I suppose.

15:37.080 --> 15:42.800
Seriously revamping the user interface, adding key features like the start button and the

15:42.800 --> 15:44.200
task bar.

15:44.200 --> 15:48.920
This marks a point where these manufacturers and the internet as a whole really wanted

15:48.920 --> 15:53.560
to show you what it was capable of, a sentiment that would follow in the coming years.

15:53.560 --> 15:59.760
In 1995, only 0.4% of the world's population was on the internet.

15:59.760 --> 16:04.920
And in the time between the turn of the millennia, we'd see things like AuctionNet, a totally

16:04.920 --> 16:09.680
online open marketplace for people to place bids in real time.

16:09.680 --> 16:15.640
A small, probably irrelevant program called Future Splash Animator was released.

16:15.640 --> 16:21.000
Oh shit, it just got bought up by Macromedia, you know, hitmaker of Shockwave, and they're

16:21.000 --> 16:23.920
calling it Macromedia Flash.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.760
I'm sure a name change like that won't happen again.

16:26.760 --> 16:32.800
GeoCities and Angel Fire, services that made creating your own personal websites a lot easier,

16:32.800 --> 16:37.560
giving users the power and creative freedom to host whatever they wanted.

16:37.560 --> 16:43.360
Then you had Six Degrees, which is widely regarded as being the first social media,

16:43.360 --> 16:46.200
implementing things like friendsless and direct messaging.

16:46.200 --> 16:53.760
And by 1988, a little thing you've probably heard of, Google, and in 1999, AuctionNet had

16:53.760 --> 17:01.360
transformed into what we know as eBay, and had facilitated around $7.2 million worth

17:01.360 --> 17:02.360
of sales.

17:02.360 --> 17:06.160
Remember that 0.4% in 1995?

17:06.160 --> 17:14.320
Well by January of 2000, that number had jumped to a whopping 4% of the world's population

17:14.320 --> 17:15.760
surfing the net.

17:15.760 --> 17:19.800
With 52% of Americans having access to the internet.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.040
You know, this whole Macromedia Flash thing is getting pretty popular.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.680
In fact, it is the most popular plugin on the internet.

17:27.680 --> 17:33.600
Oh look, a whole thriving site that's been brewing in the background dedicated to it.

17:33.600 --> 17:38.640
It's really popular, like one of the most active user bases on the internet popular.

17:38.640 --> 17:43.880
It's safe to say by the 2000s that this whole internet thing was really breaking new

17:43.880 --> 17:44.880
grounds.

17:44.880 --> 17:50.040
No, literally, the dotcom bubble just happened, fuck somebody go check on new grounds.

17:50.040 --> 17:55.640
Yeah, all that money and steam from the past few years just went down the drain.

17:55.640 --> 18:00.160
Around $5 trillion and some really notable companies down the drain.

18:00.160 --> 18:06.080
Hopefully this doesn't lead to any power vacuums in the future.

18:06.080 --> 18:10.160
Y'all have your time, we've got an internet to build.

18:10.160 --> 18:17.880
2002 to 2010 is what I like to describe as the, if you let them build it, they will come

18:17.880 --> 18:19.560
era of the internet.

18:19.560 --> 18:25.920
2002 we get the rise of Friendster, the first truly successful social media site, implementing

18:25.920 --> 18:31.480
some customization and dating app features that its competitor would soon shortly rip

18:31.480 --> 18:32.480
off.

18:32.480 --> 18:37.240
MySpace took a lot of Friendster's designs and through some gorilla marketing ended up

18:37.240 --> 18:43.560
dethroning Friendster with customizable profiles, ranking your top 8 friends, auto playing music

18:43.560 --> 18:48.360
tracks on your page, and to its detriment, many many more features.

18:48.360 --> 18:54.080
What GeoCities and Angelfire did by giving users a page of their own, MySpace perfected

18:54.080 --> 18:57.640
this time with the added layer of network ability.

18:57.640 --> 19:02.960
2004 sees the launch of a familiar face coming up for that throne, Facebook, but they're

19:02.960 --> 19:04.400
not quite significant yet.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.920
The next year, 2005 seems to be a pretty pivotal year.

19:07.920 --> 19:14.440
We see Adobe acquiring Macromedia for our final name change of that hit technology,

19:14.440 --> 19:19.440
Adobe Flash, the same year we get YouTube, a website I'm sure you know because you're

19:19.440 --> 19:20.440
on it.

19:20.440 --> 19:26.960
The Xbox 360, which I'd argue is the first console to fully utilize and get its players

19:26.960 --> 19:30.240
on board with the idea of online gameplay.

19:30.240 --> 19:35.800
I'd say largely due to the fact that 2005 also marks a turn in how Americans access

19:35.800 --> 19:36.800
the internet.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.880
Being the first year, broadband internet use overtook dial-up.

19:40.880 --> 19:46.840
Now, more of us had access to this never-ending supply of content being brought our way.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.280
Videos are loading in minutes.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.400
Games are more accessible online.

19:50.400 --> 19:55.280
No longer do we have to worry about somebody using the phone while we are surfing the web.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.680
Just infinite, unlimited browsing.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.440
The next five years are really just a rise in all of this content.

20:02.440 --> 20:06.840
YouTube continues to grow into this platform where anyone can upload whatever they want.

20:06.840 --> 20:11.480
Newground sees some of its greatest years between 2005 and 2007.

20:11.480 --> 20:15.880
Twitter is launched as this alternate social media site where you can just scream into

20:15.880 --> 20:19.000
the void of the world with whatever you want to say.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.360
And you have Reddit who is taking inspirations from other web forms, allowing users to create

20:23.360 --> 20:26.720
their own boards to talk about whatever they feel like.

20:26.720 --> 20:31.480
Only atheism and what the fuck Reddit.

20:31.480 --> 20:38.200
Reddit's earlier years screamed a lot more 4chan than its modern day variant.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.000
And speaking of 4chan, these were some of its earliest influential years from uploading

20:43.000 --> 20:49.080
a scan from a comic book in 2008 that would morph internet culture till this current day.

20:49.080 --> 20:53.040
4chan was always seen as sort of this breeding ground for internet culture.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.840
A picture that would spread throughout other sites like YouTube and Reddit and Myspace

20:56.840 --> 20:58.720
and even into the real world.

20:58.720 --> 21:03.840
These spaces inhabited by a younger generation started to feel like they were growing and

21:03.840 --> 21:06.640
developing into a place for all of us.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.520
A place where we were the providers of the entertainment.

21:09.520 --> 21:14.200
The design of the page, the contents held within it, and the humor we found funny.

21:14.200 --> 21:19.480
I bring on this up to paint a picture of the timeline and both the Wild West state that

21:19.480 --> 21:20.920
the internet had been in.

21:20.920 --> 21:25.560
You have the older generations who set up this internet thing with the fundamentals of

21:25.560 --> 21:32.040
hey, this is a place for you, you can be anyone you want on here, and if you can make it,

21:32.040 --> 21:33.040
you can share it.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.840
These were the so called rules.

21:34.840 --> 21:40.000
And now with the accessibility of the internet across America and some incredibly wise peers

21:40.000 --> 21:45.560
with the same fundamentals, it was our turn to make our stake on this whole internet thing.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.800
However, there comes a turning point.

21:47.800 --> 21:52.160
This freedom and all this new traffic coming online has a cost.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.360
As the numbers go up, so does the need to find a stream of revenue to keep this whole

21:56.360 --> 21:57.360
thing afloat.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.320
It's simply the cost of doing business.

22:00.320 --> 22:05.280
Most users are fine with seeing an ad here or there, but for Myspace it might have been

22:05.280 --> 22:07.280
their final nail in the coffin.

22:07.280 --> 22:13.040
Myspace while having the beautiful customization many users had grown to love and expect from

22:13.040 --> 22:17.240
the internet had also been dealing with countless issues on the site.

22:17.240 --> 22:22.680
From buggy apps, broken features and just the general clunkiness the site had morphed

22:22.680 --> 22:23.680
into.

22:23.680 --> 22:28.440
Compound this with security threats and revenue goals the site needed to meet, now being owned

22:28.440 --> 22:31.920
by a massive corporation, Time Inc.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.800
Ads became more intrusive and a bid to monetize the site.

22:35.800 --> 22:43.600
Many users started to hop over to the sleek, uniformly designed and feature rich Facebook.

22:43.600 --> 22:49.360
And by 2008, Facebook had dethroned Myspace as the number one social media site.

22:49.360 --> 22:55.400
Facebook seems like this new exciting thing and everyone is just moving over in hordes

22:55.400 --> 22:59.840
with fun features like poking your friends and of course the wall.

22:59.840 --> 23:05.760
Bringing all of your friends posts right there to you in an easily digestible format.

23:05.760 --> 23:10.400
Everything is very accessible and simplified, it's great.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.720
But I don't know, there does seem to be a lack of personality to your pages now.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.360
I'm sure it'll come down the road though, right?

23:17.360 --> 23:21.840
Surely this style of oversimplified design won't take over the internet.

23:21.840 --> 23:27.160
There's no way that Facebook will morph into the most influential tech company imaginable

23:27.160 --> 23:31.280
with every other major corporation following in its footsteps.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.480
Feeling comfortable with no customization at all?

23:34.560 --> 23:39.520
Hell, we'd be lucky if we don't get banned for saying a naughty word on their site.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.840
They wouldn't do that to us.

23:40.840 --> 23:45.280
They wouldn't do that to the kids who's content built their site, right?

23:55.360 --> 23:59.360
That last section may have seemed like I was going on a tangent,

23:59.360 --> 24:04.000
but I really wanted you to understand the history and how many building blocks

24:04.000 --> 24:09.360
were leading to the internet being this always uniquely user driven thing.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.680
Just solely off the customization options we have today is enough to feel like

24:13.680 --> 24:15.920
everything is a carbon copy of itself.

24:15.920 --> 24:19.200
YouTube that used to allow fully customizable backgrounds

24:19.200 --> 24:22.560
now has been boiled down to profile picture?

24:22.560 --> 24:23.120
Banner.

24:23.120 --> 24:28.080
Facebook being the replacement for MySpace which was probably one of the most customizable

24:28.080 --> 24:29.920
social media sites we'll ever see.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.800
Profile picture.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.240
Banner.

24:32.240 --> 24:32.640
Twitter.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.320
Profile picture.

24:34.880 --> 24:35.680
Banner.

24:35.680 --> 24:36.080
Reddit.

24:36.800 --> 24:37.920
Profile picture.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.720
Banner.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.720
And I mean I'll give it to Reddit, they at least have these little avatars which are kind of

24:42.720 --> 24:47.120
customizable but they still just give off that Funko Pop feeling.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.440
Speaking of feeling, all of these sites functionally act the same.

24:51.440 --> 24:56.400
No more crawling the web, instead you just scroll from one app until it's boring

24:56.400 --> 24:57.760
and then scroll through another.

24:57.760 --> 25:02.480
Every website is essentially the same song and dance of going down your timeline.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.920
Oh well that's just the most optimal way to scroll.

25:05.920 --> 25:10.480
Sure whatever, it definitely doesn't have anything to do with Facebook forcing ads into

25:10.480 --> 25:12.320
your timeline in 2012.

25:12.320 --> 25:17.680
An immensely controversial move at the time which likely in turn made them millions.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.600
Let's run a little experiment here.

25:19.600 --> 25:25.120
Open your phone, choose your favorite social media site and scroll until you've gotten fed an ad.

25:25.120 --> 25:32.480
I'm willing to guess you didn't get 8 posts deep before you saw either promoted or a sponsored post.

25:33.120 --> 25:39.520
This commodification of the internet is very reminiscent of every other aspect in our lives.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.600
Okay well they've got to make money somehow.

25:41.600 --> 25:46.320
You could always pay for one of the ad free services that are provided if you really hate

25:46.320 --> 25:47.520
the ad so much.

25:47.520 --> 25:52.160
And at the end of the day it's really the content on these platforms that matters.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.840
So let's talk about the content.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.960
Starting with YouTube.

25:54.960 --> 25:59.520
Once a powerhouse to creators who just wanted to post something online.

25:59.520 --> 26:06.560
Creating stars out of those who wanted to make films, skits, or even run their own show.

26:06.560 --> 26:11.360
Giving anyone with a creative drive their chance to be seen by an audience without the

26:11.360 --> 26:13.520
restraints you'd see in corporate television.

26:13.520 --> 26:20.480
The authenticity and grit of few people's creative expressions has morphed into anything

26:20.480 --> 26:21.680
but this sentiment.

26:21.680 --> 26:28.240
The lifeblood of the site has quickly changed from quirky kids in their bedrooms to multifaceted

26:28.240 --> 26:34.640
teams working day in and day out to bring together the most universally appealing content.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.800
This takes on its own kind of being.

26:36.800 --> 26:42.560
Creating carbon clones of itself to be copied and pasted across other social media sites.

26:42.560 --> 26:46.400
Have you ever felt like YouTube has gotten stale in that regard?

26:46.400 --> 26:52.400
My Gen X mother watches MrBeast clips that have been recycled onto Facebook.

26:52.400 --> 26:57.440
Tell me in what world she'd be watching YouTuber's former king PewDiePie.

26:57.440 --> 27:02.320
And there's an argument there that the whole let's play era of content was also just copy

27:02.320 --> 27:03.040
and pasted.

27:03.040 --> 27:08.720
Whatever game was the flavor that weak is what would be played by every single channel.

27:08.720 --> 27:13.440
The only difference was it still wasn't at that mass appeal that we see content today.

27:13.440 --> 27:18.640
It feels like everything that gets attention is meant to get attention from every other

27:18.640 --> 27:19.840
platform as well.

27:19.840 --> 27:25.040
Becoming this homogenized content regardless of what application you're using.

27:25.040 --> 27:29.120
The delivery of all this content is also fed to us through a funnel.

27:29.120 --> 27:35.920
Some supercomputer is gathering our watch time, our data, our interests and spitting out what

27:35.920 --> 27:37.760
it thinks we want.

27:38.400 --> 27:44.800
The things we consume online aren't even chosen by us, but artificially gifted by the

27:44.800 --> 27:45.680
algorithm.

27:45.680 --> 27:49.280
You ever notice how bad search functionality has gotten?

27:49.280 --> 27:51.440
Specifically on YouTube and Google.

27:51.440 --> 27:55.280
Whatever you're searching for isn't easily found anymore.

27:55.280 --> 28:00.560
You might get a few relative results, but then you'll be shown things completely removed

28:00.560 --> 28:02.880
from what you were looking for.

28:03.200 --> 28:13.840
And Google's newest addition, something that is plaguing the internet right now in general,

28:13.840 --> 28:16.720
the integration of AI.

28:21.840 --> 28:26.640
If all these things didn't make you feel like the world around us was artificially produced

28:26.640 --> 28:32.640
and some bid to either win our attention or win our money, then the introduction of

28:32.640 --> 28:37.360
literal artificial life and technology might do that to you.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.960
You ever just scroll through TikTok and get shown something like this?

28:47.760 --> 28:52.880
Not only is it the Milk Toast broad uphill content we talked about in the previous section,

28:52.880 --> 28:55.120
but now it's not even human.

28:55.120 --> 28:59.120
There's not somebody at least trying to be an entertaining host.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.680
It's just some robot trying to mimic that.

29:01.680 --> 29:06.720
Every time I see something like this, I get this sinking feeling that we are surely coming

29:06.720 --> 29:10.240
to a close of this whole internet thing being ours.

29:10.240 --> 29:15.040
There's posts like this throughout all of the web, with literal bot farms on these things

29:15.040 --> 29:17.360
just running day in and day out.

29:17.360 --> 29:22.800
The most horrifying example being those that run on Facebook, producing these AI-generated

29:22.800 --> 29:27.520
photos of Jesus getting increasingly more bizarre and incomprehensible,

29:27.520 --> 29:29.520
but doing literal numbers.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.040
Not only because boomers are kind of stupid and eat this shit up,

29:33.040 --> 29:39.280
but now there's these AI accounts that are supposed to be posing as users eating up this content.

29:39.280 --> 29:45.440
The dead internet theory has become all but a theory really and just kind of looks like our future.

29:45.440 --> 29:50.240
The worst part of all this, AI isn't some tool locked behind a corporate level paywall.

29:50.240 --> 29:55.760
Facebook isn't putting these bots out here to make the site feel more lively and have more content.

29:55.760 --> 30:00.080
AI technology is practically free for any of us to use,

30:00.080 --> 30:05.280
and that seems to be who's propagating it the most online for some reason or another.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.480
It's just us.

30:06.480 --> 30:10.560
We're still in a fairly primordial stage of all of this, I'd say.

30:10.560 --> 30:16.080
These bots can be recognized, the songs can be heard, the photos can be dissected,

30:16.080 --> 30:20.400
all pointing to this thing we're experiencing being artificial.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.200
But what happens when that isn't the case anymore?

30:23.200 --> 30:27.920
We've opened Pandora's box, and there's no going back from this technology.

30:27.920 --> 30:31.440
What happens when we can't tell who in the Twitter thread is a bot?

30:31.440 --> 30:37.520
We can't tell if the song we're listening to is a genuine artist who spent years of their life

30:37.520 --> 30:44.400
honing their craft and is instead someone who spent a couple weeks with an AI model to fabricate this song.

30:44.400 --> 30:48.400
Not only are we being guided through the content we consume by an AI,

30:48.400 --> 30:53.920
but we're about to start getting shown undistinguishable content produced by an AI.

30:53.920 --> 30:59.440
Artificial intelligence makes everything seem less real because it controls how we interact,

30:59.440 --> 31:02.160
and it does creative tasks automatically.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.840
As AI starts to control more of what we do and see online,

31:05.840 --> 31:11.280
it makes us wonder what's genuine and makes the world around us feel even less real.

31:11.280 --> 31:16.560
If you needed a better example, that quote was literally written by ChatGPT.

31:16.560 --> 31:22.000
If you've been experiencing this feeling that the world around us is growing more artificial,

31:22.000 --> 31:27.120
like myself, the integration of artificial intelligence is only going to make this worse.

31:27.120 --> 31:32.400
The internet seems to be longer moved from the days of being something to connect us all,

31:32.400 --> 31:38.320
and with the introduction of bots that we won't be able to tell apart from real genuine people,

31:38.320 --> 31:44.000
losing that feeling of individuality online, and almost everything we consume online being

31:44.000 --> 31:52.160
fed to us directly by some computer, deciding this is what we like, rather than what we actually like,

31:52.160 --> 31:56.240
or what we're feeling. It's a grim outlook for sure.

31:56.240 --> 32:01.840
I mean, speaking back to fast food, certain stores have begun integrating AI ordering menus.

32:01.840 --> 32:06.560
I have a McDonald's a few miles away from me that is strictly automated,

32:06.560 --> 32:11.680
very little human interaction. The employees are basically just in the back making the food,

32:11.680 --> 32:17.440
completely void from the customers. When you start removing humans from the human experience,

32:18.000 --> 32:24.160
especially in things that could only exist because of humans, everything you interact with

32:24.160 --> 32:30.240
just seems manufactured. I didn't set out for this video to have such a doomer vibe to it,

32:30.240 --> 32:34.560
and I really hope it didn't come off that way. I was really just trying to get

32:34.560 --> 32:38.880
down to the root of my feelings on why I'd felt the world had changed,

32:38.880 --> 32:43.440
and if the world around you seems to be growing more artificial and changing,

32:43.440 --> 32:47.600
perhaps the best thing you can do is get to the root of those feelings.

32:48.160 --> 32:52.800
That and you could always plant some strawberries and watch them grow like I have.

32:55.520 --> 33:04.400
Thank you for watching.
