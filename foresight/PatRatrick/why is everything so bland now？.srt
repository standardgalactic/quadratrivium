00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Thank you to the Patreons for supporting this channel.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,540
As someone who grew up in the early 2000s and witnessed in real time the launch of things

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,040
like YouTube and the social media boom, dined under the stained glass lamps at Pizza Hut,

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,600
traded Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon cards on the playground, and consumed a life-threatening amount of

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,080
strangely-died food items, I can't escape this feeling that everything has changed.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,760
You could chalk it up to childhood nostalgia, or the realization of time floating along,

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,040
or maybe even a growing disdain for the systems at play and finally aging up into the world

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,600
to see the bigger picture.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,080
I just don't think that's the case.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,320
It seems like throughout my childhood, the world was going in a specific direction, and

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:01,400
at some point that force was just stopped and sent down a completely different rabbit hole.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,600
Trying to pinpoint an exact moment this shift occurred seems impossible.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:20,760
I guess one of the best places to start is Hollywood.

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,520
I remember being thoroughly engulfed in the Harry Potter franchise as a child.

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,680
Games, books, candy, toys, if it had a wizard on it, I wanted it.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,320
There were several franchises that ate up all of our minds at the time, and while Harry

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,640
Potter was probably the first franchise I really remember loving as a child, a close

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,680
second had to be Spider-Man.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,880
And with the Raimi films also coming out around that time, I was primed to grow into

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,240
a lifelong comic book nerd.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,080
Luckily for me, my stepdad was already a full blown geek, and it just so happened that my

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,120
school was trying a new schedule, where we'd only have class for half a day on Wednesdays.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,120
The day my stepdad also had off.

24
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,760
So with the remainder of our day left, we'd just hang out.

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,000
He'd show me old movie franchises that he loved, like Indiana Jones and Ghostbusters,

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,080
Star Wars or Rambo, and I would latch onto these series, quickly becoming a fan.

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,920
When new movies came out, we would frequently go watch them, like Batman Begins or Prisoner

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
of Azkaban.

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,920
In hindsight, it felt a lot like a generational crossover.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,800
He'd grown up on these franchises and passed them along to me.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,720
Now we're getting our own to share like Harry Potter and these new superhero films.

32
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,600
So imagine our elation, when in May of 2008, we would see the release of a brand new Indiana

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,960
Jones movie and an Iron Man movie.

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,640
And so we went and saw both of these movies in theaters, and for both of these movies,

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,720
we had a vastly different experience.

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,480
Iron Man was amazing.

37
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,760
We both loved it.

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,280
It felt gritty like Batman Begins, but still had this charm to it like the Raimi films

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,520
that felt true to both Tony Stark and Marvel.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,160
Coming up as I normally do once the credits roll, my stepdad tells me to sit back down.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,680
He'd heard from a co-worker that there's a special ending credits scene, so we sit

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
down.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,720
Never having sat through the entire credits sequence in the movie theater, I realized

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
how long they actually were.

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,640
So I figured whatever was at the end of this had better be good, and it actually was.

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,840
The ending scene with Nick Fury and inviting Iron Man to the Avengers opened up this whole

47
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,400
can of worms and excitement for what other great stories could be told.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
It was going to be a franchise, with more heroes on the way.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,320
I was really excited to see how they'd expand on this mega franchise.

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,600
Would we get Galactus in the future?

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,960
Kang, what if those X-Men movies that have been coming out end up crossing over with

52
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
it?

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,080
I was simply overjoyed with how fresh and new this all seemed to be.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,560
I was once again ready to eat up another franchise.

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,720
Now on the other side of the spectrum was Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,200
There was a bit of a different experience between me and my stepdad.

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,960
I remember him walking out just as disappointed as me, seeing one of your favorite series brought

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,280
back to life and smashed in front of you.

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,320
Little did I know that that would be a constant feeling in the future.

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,300
The whole movie felt off.

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,920
It seemed like it was brought back solely for the point of being able to say, hey, we brought

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
it back.

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,360
Wasn't that cool?

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,000
Well entirely missing the point of what made the franchise so drawing in the first place.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,280
I don't know, something just felt off.

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,480
I remember an incredibly heavy toy rollout with this movie as well.

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,440
As I walked the toy aisle between the go-go crazy bones, the airhog havoc hellies, that

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,480
new Batmobile, I saw that shitty whip.

69
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,080
I felt like I was watching something I loved get its corpse dug up and paraded around,

70
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,520
all to make a quick buck.

71
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,040
This wasn't uncommon and still isn't today.

72
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,720
Literally everything that can be marketed towards kids will have cheap plastic garbage

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
made for them.

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,520
I mean, most of the 80s cartoons were built solely off of the principle of selling toys.

75
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,040
But it was the first time that I ever noticed it.

76
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,200
Fast forward to the present day and we have a 5th Indiana Jones movie that did the same

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,680
song and dance.

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,200
That little Marvel thing that I was so excited for is now up to 32 films with another 8 shows

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,840
that you just have to catch up on.

80
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,320
That should have been the dream, right?

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,760
And it was, for a while, before everything became so monotone.

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,680
Babe, wake up, it's time for your yearly Marvel rollout.

83
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,240
Babe, wake up, it's time to bring another franchise back from the day.

84
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,440
Babe, wake up, it's time for you to add a cute creature in a film to sell toys.

85
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,400
Babe, wake up, it's time to sit through the post-post credits.

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,840
There's been a growing sentiment that Hollywood is running out of ideas and from a surface

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,320
level it is very hard to argue.

88
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,800
Anytime something is mildly popular, it'll get mass produced to extinction.

89
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,360
However, some old IP will get dug up solely for, hey, remember this thing points?

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,800
It used to be cute, but now it seems all the Hollywood blockbusters are being mass produced

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,480
to appeal to the widest variety of people, making everything feel ultimately stale.

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,760
You can't stray too far into the source material or you may alienate casual viewers, can't

93
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,120
have a self-contained story, everything has to be this huge spectacle.

94
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,720
Don't even get me started on the commodification of all this.

95
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,520
You want to talk about cheap plastic garbage geared towards kids?

96
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,720
We've got that for adults now, in every imaginable thing they could possibly want.

97
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,480
Pick your fucking brand cause there's tons of them, most of them owned by the same company.

98
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,880
Crockpots, aprons, cat collars, chopsticks, you name it, they'll slap your favorite

99
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
IP on it.

100
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,160
It's so draining going into a store like Boxlunch anymore.

101
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,040
Really a monument to the whole trend of this is a forever IP.

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Remember this thing?

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah, we're gonna milk it to death with the most mundane merch imaginable, which brings

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,120
me into my second point.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:44,800
Everything is so boring to look at.

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,720
There's a reason why people have been so drawn to these Y2K aesthetics, like Frutiger

107
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,320
and its mini spinoffs, they're memorable, visually appealing and stuck out in a sea of

108
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,680
other designs.

109
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Even exploring old angel firepages has a certain air of excitement to it that you will never

110
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,240
find on a modern web page today.

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,440
There's no more sticking out in a sea of designs, there's just the sea.

112
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,760
For example, I was talking to a friend about old lunchables, specifically the dessert pizza

113
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
ones.

114
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm not questioning how I'd love the dessert pizzas, but I don't think they make them

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,760
anymore because I can never find them.

116
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,040
I did a little Google search and saw they do in fact still make them, but this packaging

117
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,680
is horrendous compared to the 2000s packaging.

118
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Like I'm not crazy right?

119
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,080
Not even just from a personal perspective, but this is objectively a worse design for

120
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,560
a product geared towards children.

121
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,880
Like this one looks like something I would see on my grandma's metamucil.

122
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,160
Another example, Fierce Cola Competitors, Pepsi and Coke.

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,680
This is their 2000s design.

124
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,300
Pepsi has this rich blue, the logo is off-centered and the name is going vertically.

125
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,400
The can also features this almost ice cube design to it.

126
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Coke on the other hand is sporting this shiny red can, with the label also vertical, but

127
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,440
it has these caramel lines running across the bottom with this floaty almost bubbly wave

128
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,760
pattern to it.

129
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,000
Both are incredibly simple in design, but are both uniquely their own style.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,640
I don't even have to mention the cherry lineup that these guys had, because these are some

131
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,800
of the most memorable soft drink designs of all time.

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,560
Fast forward to today however, and do you want the red can or would you like the blue can?

133
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,640
That is basically the only difference you can make between the two.

134
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,680
There's almost no attempt to stand out in a crowd, aside from this color scheme and

135
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
logo.

136
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,800
I feel like this is why my eye is so heavily drawn to things like Mountain Dew.

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,760
That and I'm a fucking gamer.

138
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,120
I mean at least there's something going on there.

139
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,400
At least Mountain Dew treats me like I can comprehend more than just some logo and a

140
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
color scheme.

141
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,800
It's also a big part of why I think things like liquid death get so popular.

142
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,640
In a sea of bland corporate BS on shelves, if you can manage to get that shelving space

143
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,400
with them and look different people are going to be intrigued.

144
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,960
Bonus points if you like actually make a good product.

145
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,840
I could not fathom anyone preferring these minimalist designs on our products.

146
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,440
So who are they for?

147
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,680
Am I just looking way too deeply into something as mundane as the packaging our food comes

148
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
in?

149
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Something most people probably don't even bat an eye at?

150
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,840
Maybe I just need to go outside, get off the internet for a little while and fuck me.

151
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,800
This homogenized look has even bled into architecture.

152
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,000
Remember the iconic red roof McDonald's used to have?

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,560
The adobe styling of Taco Bell.

154
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,280
That pizzeria feeling of Pizza Hut?

155
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,200
Or the sunroom in Wendy's?

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,680
Gone are those days.

157
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,240
Now they are all these sleek boxy monoliths to fast food.

158
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Painted grey, white, black, or whatever the most drab color they could find.

159
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,920
The insides do not get much better either.

160
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,960
My McDonald's before its remodel used to have a genuinely cozy vibe for a McDonald's.

161
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,880
Now it is absolutely sterile.

162
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,840
Just like how all fast food restaurants now feel.

163
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm not asking for rainforest cafe levels of ambiance, but the environment that's

164
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,800
been crafted here is just depressing.

165
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,880
And when your food is already depressing enough, choosing to eat in an environment like this

166
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
is horrible.

167
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,520
It's like it's been crafted to be the most cold, uncomfortable place to eat a meal in.

168
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Functional?

169
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Absolutely.

170
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,600
You can sit down and you can eat a meal here, but you don't want to be in here.

171
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,800
It feels like the company is actively trying to dissuade you from being in their establishment.

172
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,160
It feels like a new take on hostile architecture where it is absolutely hideous to look at

173
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,280
while still serving its function at the most basic level of say a bench or a chair.

174
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,720
But you won't be comfortable because it is designed to keep you away.

175
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,680
The thing is, Chipotle and Panda Express were using this exact design prior to the renaissance

176
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,080
of this drab interior deco.

177
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,800
But I never felt particularly cold eating at either of these restaurants.

178
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,080
So why is that?

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,440
Well, probably because the stores were designed like that from the start.

180
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,480
Scott Shipley, designer of Chipotle's stores had this to say about their thought process.

181
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,800
Our food is simple ingredients.

182
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
It's what you do with them that counts.

183
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,480
The idea with the architecture was let's take these simple rudimentary materials, but

184
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,160
what we do with them will say something and we'll get a look out of that.

185
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,600
When entering a restaurant that looks like this, at a time when other restaurants look

186
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,800
like this or this or this, it doesn't feel so sterile now, does it?

187
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,160
It's unique and exciting.

188
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,800
Kind of like a new superhero movie.

189
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,200
But after the 33rd time that you've seen a restaurant with this design completely stripped

190
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:33,040
from its source material, it starts to feel a little manufactured for you to like it without

191
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,040
understanding why it worked in the first place.

192
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,960
I've talked ad nauseam on this channel about internet nostalgia, but the web has changed

193
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,680
and that growth has directly affected the human race.

194
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,880
And a lot of us have seen that effect happen in real time.

195
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,040
This is before TikTok and Twitter bots, before the word meme was widespread, a simpler, more

196
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,960
wild west environment.

197
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,600
No one really knew where this thing was going, but it was exciting.

198
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720
And once you experienced it, you were pulled in.

199
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,320
You can't place the blame on what the internet has become on one person or one company, but

200
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,920
I can confidently say giving this guy the reins for so long was not the right move.

201
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,240
Let's go over an extended and very crude history lesson.

202
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,240
In the 1980s, people were using computers like this.

203
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,720
Doing, I don't know, boring office work, nerdy stuff, trying to play Leisure Suit Larry.

204
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,680
Point is, not a lot of people were using computers.

205
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,400
You had businessmen, working class citizens, and the really fringe nerds.

206
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,240
Computers were expensive, hard to navigate, and a lot of people weren't sure of the applications

207
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
yet.

208
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,200
Throughout the turn of the decade, computers started to get a lot faster and a lot cheaper,

209
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,160
all due to developments in the manufacturing of microchips.

210
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,680
Not only that, all this new power allowed for computers to go from looking like this,

211
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,780
to this.

212
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,920
The ease of access had been figured out, and now you're seeing families not only getting

213
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,120
home computers, but also getting dial-up internet.

214
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,240
And by 1995, we got the greatest piece of technology ever released.

215
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,040
And no, that isn't a joke.

216
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,200
I die for this dog, and I don't care what you think.

217
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,080
Also, Windows 1995 was rather notable too, I suppose.

218
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,800
Seriously revamping the user interface, adding key features like the start button and the

219
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,200
task bar.

220
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,920
This marks a point where these manufacturers and the internet as a whole really wanted

221
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,560
to show you what it was capable of, a sentiment that would follow in the coming years.

222
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,760
In 1995, only 0.4% of the world's population was on the internet.

223
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,920
And in the time between the turn of the millennia, we'd see things like AuctionNet, a totally

224
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,680
online open marketplace for people to place bids in real time.

225
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,640
A small, probably irrelevant program called Future Splash Animator was released.

226
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh shit, it just got bought up by Macromedia, you know, hitmaker of Shockwave, and they're

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,920
calling it Macromedia Flash.

228
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,760
I'm sure a name change like that won't happen again.

229
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,800
GeoCities and Angel Fire, services that made creating your own personal websites a lot easier,

230
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,560
giving users the power and creative freedom to host whatever they wanted.

231
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,360
Then you had Six Degrees, which is widely regarded as being the first social media,

232
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,200
implementing things like friendsless and direct messaging.

233
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,760
And by 1988, a little thing you've probably heard of, Google, and in 1999, AuctionNet had

234
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,360
transformed into what we know as eBay, and had facilitated around $7.2 million worth

235
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
of sales.

236
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,160
Remember that 0.4% in 1995?

237
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,320
Well by January of 2000, that number had jumped to a whopping 4% of the world's population

238
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,760
surfing the net.

239
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,800
With 52% of Americans having access to the internet.

240
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,040
You know, this whole Macromedia Flash thing is getting pretty popular.

241
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,680
In fact, it is the most popular plugin on the internet.

242
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:33,600
Oh look, a whole thriving site that's been brewing in the background dedicated to it.

243
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,640
It's really popular, like one of the most active user bases on the internet popular.

244
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,880
It's safe to say by the 2000s that this whole internet thing was really breaking new

245
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
grounds.

246
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,040
No, literally, the dotcom bubble just happened, fuck somebody go check on new grounds.

247
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,640
Yeah, all that money and steam from the past few years just went down the drain.

248
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Around $5 trillion and some really notable companies down the drain.

249
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,080
Hopefully this doesn't lead to any power vacuums in the future.

250
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,160
Y'all have your time, we've got an internet to build.

251
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,880
2002 to 2010 is what I like to describe as the, if you let them build it, they will come

252
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,560
era of the internet.

253
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:25,920
2002 we get the rise of Friendster, the first truly successful social media site, implementing

254
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,480
some customization and dating app features that its competitor would soon shortly rip

255
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
off.

256
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,240
MySpace took a lot of Friendster's designs and through some gorilla marketing ended up

257
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,560
dethroning Friendster with customizable profiles, ranking your top 8 friends, auto playing music

258
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,360
tracks on your page, and to its detriment, many many more features.

259
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,080
What GeoCities and Angelfire did by giving users a page of their own, MySpace perfected

260
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,640
this time with the added layer of network ability.

261
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,960
2004 sees the launch of a familiar face coming up for that throne, Facebook, but they're

262
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
not quite significant yet.

263
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,920
The next year, 2005 seems to be a pretty pivotal year.

264
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,440
We see Adobe acquiring Macromedia for our final name change of that hit technology,

265
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Adobe Flash, the same year we get YouTube, a website I'm sure you know because you're

266
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
on it.

267
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,960
The Xbox 360, which I'd argue is the first console to fully utilize and get its players

268
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
on board with the idea of online gameplay.

269
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,800
I'd say largely due to the fact that 2005 also marks a turn in how Americans access

270
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
the internet.

271
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,880
Being the first year, broadband internet use overtook dial-up.

272
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,840
Now, more of us had access to this never-ending supply of content being brought our way.

273
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,280
Videos are loading in minutes.

274
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,400
Games are more accessible online.

275
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,280
No longer do we have to worry about somebody using the phone while we are surfing the web.

276
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,680
Just infinite, unlimited browsing.

277
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,440
The next five years are really just a rise in all of this content.

278
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,840
YouTube continues to grow into this platform where anyone can upload whatever they want.

279
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,480
Newground sees some of its greatest years between 2005 and 2007.

280
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,880
Twitter is launched as this alternate social media site where you can just scream into

281
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,000
the void of the world with whatever you want to say.

282
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,360
And you have Reddit who is taking inspirations from other web forms, allowing users to create

283
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,720
their own boards to talk about whatever they feel like.

284
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,480
Only atheism and what the fuck Reddit.

285
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,200
Reddit's earlier years screamed a lot more 4chan than its modern day variant.

286
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,000
And speaking of 4chan, these were some of its earliest influential years from uploading

287
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,080
a scan from a comic book in 2008 that would morph internet culture till this current day.

288
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,040
4chan was always seen as sort of this breeding ground for internet culture.

289
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,840
A picture that would spread throughout other sites like YouTube and Reddit and Myspace

290
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,720
and even into the real world.

291
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,840
These spaces inhabited by a younger generation started to feel like they were growing and

292
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,640
developing into a place for all of us.

293
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,520
A place where we were the providers of the entertainment.

294
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,200
The design of the page, the contents held within it, and the humor we found funny.

295
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,480
I bring on this up to paint a picture of the timeline and both the Wild West state that

296
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,920
the internet had been in.

297
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,560
You have the older generations who set up this internet thing with the fundamentals of

298
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:32,040
hey, this is a place for you, you can be anyone you want on here, and if you can make it,

299
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
you can share it.

300
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,840
These were the so called rules.

301
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,000
And now with the accessibility of the internet across America and some incredibly wise peers

302
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,560
with the same fundamentals, it was our turn to make our stake on this whole internet thing.

303
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,800
However, there comes a turning point.

304
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,160
This freedom and all this new traffic coming online has a cost.

305
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,360
As the numbers go up, so does the need to find a stream of revenue to keep this whole

306
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
thing afloat.

307
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,320
It's simply the cost of doing business.

308
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,280
Most users are fine with seeing an ad here or there, but for Myspace it might have been

309
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
their final nail in the coffin.

310
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,040
Myspace while having the beautiful customization many users had grown to love and expect from

311
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,240
the internet had also been dealing with countless issues on the site.

312
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,680
From buggy apps, broken features and just the general clunkiness the site had morphed

313
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
into.

314
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,440
Compound this with security threats and revenue goals the site needed to meet, now being owned

315
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,920
by a massive corporation, Time Inc.

316
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,800
Ads became more intrusive and a bid to monetize the site.

317
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Many users started to hop over to the sleek, uniformly designed and feature rich Facebook.

318
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,360
And by 2008, Facebook had dethroned Myspace as the number one social media site.

319
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,400
Facebook seems like this new exciting thing and everyone is just moving over in hordes

320
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,840
with fun features like poking your friends and of course the wall.

321
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,760
Bringing all of your friends posts right there to you in an easily digestible format.

322
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,400
Everything is very accessible and simplified, it's great.

323
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,720
But I don't know, there does seem to be a lack of personality to your pages now.

324
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,360
I'm sure it'll come down the road though, right?

325
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,840
Surely this style of oversimplified design won't take over the internet.

326
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,160
There's no way that Facebook will morph into the most influential tech company imaginable

327
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,280
with every other major corporation following in its footsteps.

328
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,480
Feeling comfortable with no customization at all?

329
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,520
Hell, we'd be lucky if we don't get banned for saying a naughty word on their site.

330
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,840
They wouldn't do that to us.

331
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,280
They wouldn't do that to the kids who's content built their site, right?

332
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,360
That last section may have seemed like I was going on a tangent,

333
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,000
but I really wanted you to understand the history and how many building blocks

334
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,360
were leading to the internet being this always uniquely user driven thing.

335
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,680
Just solely off the customization options we have today is enough to feel like

336
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,920
everything is a carbon copy of itself.

337
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,200
YouTube that used to allow fully customizable backgrounds

338
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,560
now has been boiled down to profile picture?

339
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,120
Banner.

340
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,080
Facebook being the replacement for MySpace which was probably one of the most customizable

341
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,920
social media sites we'll ever see.

342
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,800
Profile picture.

343
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,240
Banner.

344
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,640
Twitter.

345
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,320
Profile picture.

346
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,680
Banner.

347
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,080
Reddit.

348
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,920
Profile picture.

349
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,720
Banner.

350
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,720
And I mean I'll give it to Reddit, they at least have these little avatars which are kind of

351
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,120
customizable but they still just give off that Funko Pop feeling.

352
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,440
Speaking of feeling, all of these sites functionally act the same.

353
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,400
No more crawling the web, instead you just scroll from one app until it's boring

354
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,760
and then scroll through another.

355
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,480
Every website is essentially the same song and dance of going down your timeline.

356
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,920
Oh well that's just the most optimal way to scroll.

357
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,480
Sure whatever, it definitely doesn't have anything to do with Facebook forcing ads into

358
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,320
your timeline in 2012.

359
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,680
An immensely controversial move at the time which likely in turn made them millions.

360
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,600
Let's run a little experiment here.

361
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,120
Open your phone, choose your favorite social media site and scroll until you've gotten fed an ad.

362
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm willing to guess you didn't get 8 posts deep before you saw either promoted or a sponsored post.

363
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,520
This commodification of the internet is very reminiscent of every other aspect in our lives.

364
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,600
Okay well they've got to make money somehow.

365
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,320
You could always pay for one of the ad free services that are provided if you really hate

366
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
the ad so much.

367
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,160
And at the end of the day it's really the content on these platforms that matters.

368
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,840
So let's talk about the content.

369
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,960
Starting with YouTube.

370
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,520
Once a powerhouse to creators who just wanted to post something online.

371
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,560
Creating stars out of those who wanted to make films, skits, or even run their own show.

372
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,360
Giving anyone with a creative drive their chance to be seen by an audience without the

373
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,520
restraints you'd see in corporate television.

374
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,480
The authenticity and grit of few people's creative expressions has morphed into anything

375
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,680
but this sentiment.

376
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,240
The lifeblood of the site has quickly changed from quirky kids in their bedrooms to multifaceted

377
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,640
teams working day in and day out to bring together the most universally appealing content.

378
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,800
This takes on its own kind of being.

379
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,560
Creating carbon clones of itself to be copied and pasted across other social media sites.

380
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Have you ever felt like YouTube has gotten stale in that regard?

381
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,400
My Gen X mother watches MrBeast clips that have been recycled onto Facebook.

382
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,440
Tell me in what world she'd be watching YouTuber's former king PewDiePie.

383
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,320
And there's an argument there that the whole let's play era of content was also just copy

384
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,040
and pasted.

385
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,720
Whatever game was the flavor that weak is what would be played by every single channel.

386
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,440
The only difference was it still wasn't at that mass appeal that we see content today.

387
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,640
It feels like everything that gets attention is meant to get attention from every other

388
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,840
platform as well.

389
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,040
Becoming this homogenized content regardless of what application you're using.

390
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,120
The delivery of all this content is also fed to us through a funnel.

391
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,920
Some supercomputer is gathering our watch time, our data, our interests and spitting out what

392
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,760
it thinks we want.

393
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,800
The things we consume online aren't even chosen by us, but artificially gifted by the

394
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,680
algorithm.

395
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,280
You ever notice how bad search functionality has gotten?

396
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,440
Specifically on YouTube and Google.

397
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,280
Whatever you're searching for isn't easily found anymore.

398
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,560
You might get a few relative results, but then you'll be shown things completely removed

399
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,880
from what you were looking for.

400
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:13,840
And Google's newest addition, something that is plaguing the internet right now in general,

401
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,720
the integration of AI.

402
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,640
If all these things didn't make you feel like the world around us was artificially produced

403
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,640
and some bid to either win our attention or win our money, then the introduction of

404
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,360
literal artificial life and technology might do that to you.

405
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,960
You ever just scroll through TikTok and get shown something like this?

406
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,880
Not only is it the Milk Toast broad uphill content we talked about in the previous section,

407
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,120
but now it's not even human.

408
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,120
There's not somebody at least trying to be an entertaining host.

409
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,680
It's just some robot trying to mimic that.

410
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,720
Every time I see something like this, I get this sinking feeling that we are surely coming

411
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,240
to a close of this whole internet thing being ours.

412
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,040
There's posts like this throughout all of the web, with literal bot farms on these things

413
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,360
just running day in and day out.

414
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,800
The most horrifying example being those that run on Facebook, producing these AI-generated

415
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,520
photos of Jesus getting increasingly more bizarre and incomprehensible,

416
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
but doing literal numbers.

417
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,040
Not only because boomers are kind of stupid and eat this shit up,

418
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,280
but now there's these AI accounts that are supposed to be posing as users eating up this content.

419
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,440
The dead internet theory has become all but a theory really and just kind of looks like our future.

420
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,240
The worst part of all this, AI isn't some tool locked behind a corporate level paywall.

421
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,760
Facebook isn't putting these bots out here to make the site feel more lively and have more content.

422
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,080
AI technology is practically free for any of us to use,

423
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,280
and that seems to be who's propagating it the most online for some reason or another.

424
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,480
It's just us.

425
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,560
We're still in a fairly primordial stage of all of this, I'd say.

426
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,080
These bots can be recognized, the songs can be heard, the photos can be dissected,

427
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,400
all pointing to this thing we're experiencing being artificial.

428
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,200
But what happens when that isn't the case anymore?

429
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,920
We've opened Pandora's box, and there's no going back from this technology.

430
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,440
What happens when we can't tell who in the Twitter thread is a bot?

431
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,520
We can't tell if the song we're listening to is a genuine artist who spent years of their life

432
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,400
honing their craft and is instead someone who spent a couple weeks with an AI model to fabricate this song.

433
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Not only are we being guided through the content we consume by an AI,

434
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,920
but we're about to start getting shown undistinguishable content produced by an AI.

435
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,440
Artificial intelligence makes everything seem less real because it controls how we interact,

436
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,160
and it does creative tasks automatically.

437
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,840
As AI starts to control more of what we do and see online,

438
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,280
it makes us wonder what's genuine and makes the world around us feel even less real.

439
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,560
If you needed a better example, that quote was literally written by ChatGPT.

440
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,000
If you've been experiencing this feeling that the world around us is growing more artificial,

441
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,120
like myself, the integration of artificial intelligence is only going to make this worse.

442
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,400
The internet seems to be longer moved from the days of being something to connect us all,

443
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:38,320
and with the introduction of bots that we won't be able to tell apart from real genuine people,

444
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,000
losing that feeling of individuality online, and almost everything we consume online being

445
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,160
fed to us directly by some computer, deciding this is what we like, rather than what we actually like,

446
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,240
or what we're feeling. It's a grim outlook for sure.

447
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,840
I mean, speaking back to fast food, certain stores have begun integrating AI ordering menus.

448
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,560
I have a McDonald's a few miles away from me that is strictly automated,

449
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,680
very little human interaction. The employees are basically just in the back making the food,

450
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,440
completely void from the customers. When you start removing humans from the human experience,

451
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,160
especially in things that could only exist because of humans, everything you interact with

452
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,240
just seems manufactured. I didn't set out for this video to have such a doomer vibe to it,

453
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,560
and I really hope it didn't come off that way. I was really just trying to get

454
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,880
down to the root of my feelings on why I'd felt the world had changed,

455
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,440
and if the world around you seems to be growing more artificial and changing,

456
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,600
perhaps the best thing you can do is get to the root of those feelings.

457
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,800
That and you could always plant some strawberries and watch them grow like I have.

458
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:04,400
Thank you for watching.
