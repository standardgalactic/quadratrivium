1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And what he found was fascinating that what happens first is the start of the activity

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,080
in the brain and then really only 200 milliseconds and very shortly before the action is the

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,240
time when you think you've decided to act.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,920
In other words, the brains that started being ready to move before you make the decision

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
that you're going to move.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,720
Now, this makes perfect sense in biological terms, it's perfectly ordinary result in a

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,880
way and the world crashed down upon him, you know, endless philosophical arguments, endless

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,960
neuroscientific arguments who said something along the lines of, in the end, I let the

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,800
decision make itself and that was a certain freedom and it was all fine.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,240
And it is in Zen terms, it's often described as let the universe do it or let the practice

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
do it.

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,040
You know, you have to find something else to blame and blaming the practice of meditation

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,520
is quite innocuous compared with blaming an inner self who has magical powers to control

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,360
everything.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:36,320
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Chasing Consciousness.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,400
I really hope you're enjoying this second series as much as I am.

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,240
And if you are, I would be extremely grateful if you can help me spread the word by sharing

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,000
these shows, rating them and maybe even reviewing us on iTunes podcast if you're an iTunes

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
person.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
So today, we have the tough job of evaluating the evidence for the existence of free work

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,720
Now, as you know, the debate has raged for centuries in philosophy, but now with advances

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,180
in neuroscience and psychology experiments, we may have some actual physical evidence

23
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,680
to argue over.

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,760
Now we're also going to be getting into meditation and Zen as it seems that those who use some

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,240
kind of mindfulness meditation and hence they're used to watching the way their thoughts arise

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
and pass without actually identifying with them, they seem to be much less troubled by

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,320
the idea that they may not have free will.

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,320
So who better to explain this mind-boggling question than our first returning guest, psychologist,

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,720
author and visiting professor at Plymouth University, Susan Blackmore.

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,520
She's best known for her books The Meme Machine, Zen and the Art of Consciousness, Consciousness

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,200
and Introduction and Seeing Myself and her work spans across hundreds of different publications

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,200
in over 20 different languages, making great contributions in the fields of psychology,

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,200
memetics, religion, philosophy of mind, supernatural experience and many other areas.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,700
Now, this problem has troubled me since I first started questioning it while studying philosophy

35
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,040
so I really can't wait to get into this with someone who's been wrestling with this problem

36
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,480
at the highest level of academia for over 20 years.

37
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,480
So without further ado, let's go.

38
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,040
Sue Blackmore, welcome back to Chasing Consciousness.

39
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,480
Thank you so much for joining us a second time.

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,040
You're very welcome.

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,320
Straight back from a Zen retreat.

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,720
How does it feel to come off straight out of a Zen retreat into talking about important philosophical stuff?

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Is it an advantage or a disadvantage, I wonder?

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,720
We'll see, but it's been a few days.

45
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I got back on Saturday evening and it carries on after the retreat and insights kind of come.

46
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,720
People often say this, you know, you work away and work away day after day, sitting, sitting, sitting

47
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
and some things shift and so on.

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,720
But actually it's afterwards the shifts go on and on and I'm still in that kind of shifting in the way

49
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
I'm seeing the world, which is rather interesting.

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,720
I'm rather looking forward to getting your reflections while you're still in that sort of very, very clear detached state.

51
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm very curious.

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,720
So Sue has been on the show already and as a result, well, first of all, listeners, you must go back to the first episode

53
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,720
and hear Sue's extraordinary rendition of her out-of-body experience, now famous out-of-body experience

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,720
and her insight into the hard problem of consciousness.

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,720
But because of that, Sue, you've already answered my usual first question about formative influences.

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,720
So I wanted to ask you something a bit differently, mostly because I know you love these mind games.

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I've been pernumbulating recently a lot about maturity and how radically we can change our approach to certain things as we get older.

58
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
So I'd like you to ask you this.

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Can you choose one of those first memorable, formative, big questions from those intense teenage years

60
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,720
that really gripped you and try and compare how you thought about it then to how you thought about it now?

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Yeah.

62
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:32,720
If I strictly take the teenage years, I did wonder about patterns and why birds were flying in a V shape

63
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
and was there some strange, you know, patterning going on in the world?

64
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
It turns out there isn't.

65
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
I mean, not in that sense at any rate.

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,720
We know exactly why they fly in V formations now, which is a mixture of physics and how their brains work.

67
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,720
But I think this is probably 20.

68
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
So I think I hope that will count.

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I became obsessed with the question of memory.

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
How does memory work?

71
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
In a way now, I would think of it as a question to do with consciousness, which I didn't really think about then.

72
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
And you were not allowed to talk about consciousness.

73
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
We're talking 1970, 71-ish.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Consciousness was not mentioned in a psychology degree in those days.

75
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,720
So it's perhaps not surprising I didn't think about it that way.

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,720
But I can remember standing outside the psychology department in Oxford and thinking,

77
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I remember this place.

78
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I remember going in there yesterday.

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
How does a brain do that?

80
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
What's going on?

81
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
What is memory?

82
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,720
And I was making up all these theories about memory being outside of the brain, psychic kind of theories.

83
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Because I was really into all that psychic stuff, as you know, after the outer body experience.

84
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I believed all these things.

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
So I had all these kind of psychic theories.

86
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,720
And the actual science that was going on then was rubbish.

87
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,720
There was talk about chopping up planarian worms and that memory was stored in RNA

88
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
and that the molecules were storing the information,

89
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
which is obviously crazy because you couldn't get the information out fast enough.

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,720
I can ask you, what's the number of your house?

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Well, you're very slow.

92
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
But you know, what's the capital of France?

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,720
You haven't got a brain at all.

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
You've got RNA working in there.

95
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
I've got no memory.

96
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I even lived there.

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
How old are you?

98
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
44.

99
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Well, that was a bit quicker.

100
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,720
The point is, those theories were kind of impossible to work

101
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
and they didn't have better theories.

102
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,720
And so I was really getting carried away with memory is out there and all our memories are shared.

103
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,720
And ESP is really only a special case of the more general concepts of memory.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,720
And sorry, the other way round, our private memories are a special case of the general availability of all it.

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I mean, that was equally crap from, you know, but that was my obsession.

106
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,720
And I nearly did a PhD, took a PhD place to study memory at Sussex University.

107
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
And I turned it down because I wanted to prove the paranormal was true.

108
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
And so that was my obsession.

109
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Now we have a really good idea and there's so much more to learn,

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,720
but we really understand about dendritic growth and how the connections between neurons,

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:13,720
synaptic strength is altered and the fascinating mixture of digital and log processes going on in brains.

112
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,720
And, you know, I mean, it's making sense now.

113
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
So it's definitely a full conversation.

114
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,720
It's definitely something we're going to have to look into on chasing consciousness to be complete in our work.

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,720
So it's it's going to be a whole show on the different series of memory.

116
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,720
You're never going to be complete.

117
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
That I can imagine.

118
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,720
So as you know, OK, what next are you going to tempt me with?

119
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Right, straight to the big one.

120
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Free will.

121
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,720
The argument has, of course, raged for centuries in philosophy.

122
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,720
But rather than getting to those conceptual arguments, which are human mental constructs,

123
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,720
let's go to the more recent experiments in psychology and neuroscience

124
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
that, in your opinion, give us physical proof that free will is an illusion.

125
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I think Libit is probably the best place to start, right?

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Poor fellow.

127
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,720
He actually set out to prove that free will was real, didn't he?

128
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
He did.

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm shaking my head because I don't think there's any proof.

130
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,720
And I'm not going to claim there's any proof.

131
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
OK, so that's too strong a word.

132
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Yes, exactly.

133
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,720
I mean, just to set it up, you mentioned that it's been going on a long time.

134
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I mean, I love it.

135
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Samuel Johnson in the 18th century said something like,

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,720
all theory is against freedom of the will.

137
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
All experience is for it.

138
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Now, he didn't have any neuroscience.

139
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,720
He was just looking at the world, as you might with dependent origination,

140
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
as you mentioned.

141
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,720
But you can look at the world and see how it operates and think there can't be free will.

142
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,720
And he could do that 200 years ago, more than 200 years ago.

143
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Now, we have so much neuroscience and so much more evidence.

144
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,720
The problem is, yes, there can't be free will.

145
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,720
But people still go on believing in it against all the odds.

146
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,720
And I can't prove it because of that, because they'll always come up with,

147
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
oh, yes, but what about my experience?

148
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Anyway, Libet.

149
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,720
So Libet, a lovely man.

150
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I have met him a couple of times.

151
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,720
I had a wonderful walk with him in San Francisco near the Golden Gate Bridge.

152
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
And we were walking along this road.

153
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
And there was a little kid further up the pavement.

154
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,720
And he said something like, to give you an example of what he believes about it,

155
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,720
he said, the experiments may show that I'm not free to think what to do,

156
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
but I can stop myself doing things.

157
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,720
For example, if I had an impulse to want to go and murder that little girl,

158
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
if I was a wicked person, a murderer, but I could stop myself.

159
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
And that's the important part of free will.

160
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,720
So he was kind of hedging his bets at that point.

161
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,720
And why I say it was lovely conversations with him is because he really cared about it.

162
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
And so he did these experiments, as you point out,

163
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
because he was trying to prove that there was free will.

164
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,720
And I expect most of your listeners will know his experiments,

165
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,720
but very briefly, we're talking them early to mid-80s.

166
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,720
And what he did was he asked people to do a simple action,

167
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,720
because whenever they wanted to, of their own free will,

168
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
spontaneously, deliberately, to flex their wrist.

169
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,720
They didn't have a choice about what to do.

170
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,720
They only had a choice about when to do it.

171
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
But that's all he could do because he didn't have brain scans.

172
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
He only had EEG.

173
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,720
So he had EEG on the head to look at the motor strip

174
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,720
when the action would start there, the readiness potential will start.

175
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
So you have a readiness potential.

176
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
If you imagine a graph, it's like building up, building up, building up,

177
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
and then the action happens.

178
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,720
And that can go up to a second before the action takes place.

179
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,720
So he measured the time of that happening in the brain.

180
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,720
He measured with an electrode on the wrist the time of the movement.

181
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,720
And then he had to try and measure when the person made the decision to move.

182
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Now, that's why his experiments are, I would say still,

183
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,720
the most famous experiments ever done on consciousness.

184
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
The way he measured it was very clever.

185
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,720
He had a spot revolving on a screen,

186
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,720
and he asked people to shout out, we'll say,

187
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
where the spot was when they decided to act.

188
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,720
And what's critical about this method is,

189
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,720
it's no good pressing a lever or something,

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,720
it's a lag the same way as the lag that's going on in the movement.

191
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,720
But this way you reported after the fact.

192
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,720
So the spots going round, you make a movement,

193
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
and afterwards you say, oh, I decided when the spot was at four,

194
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,720
or six, or nine, or whatever it was.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
So I often in lectures have had like,

196
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
I got 100 or however many people sitting there,

197
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,720
and all going like this, and I asked them to shout out,

198
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,720
and I'll go like this, and I'll be the spot.

199
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,720
And then I say, shout out where it was when you decided.

200
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,720
And they got here, 12, 5, 7, you know, people can do it.

201
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
One of the philosophical objections is they can't do it.

202
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
They can do it easily.

203
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,720
And what he found was fascinating that what happens first

204
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
is the start of the activity in the brain.

205
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,720
And then really only 200 milliseconds,

206
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
and very shortly before the action is the time

207
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
when you think you've decided to act.

208
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,720
In other words, the brains that started being ready to move

209
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
before you make the decision that you're going to move.

210
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Now, this makes perfect sense in biological terms.

211
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,720
It's perfectly ordinary result in a way.

212
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,720
And the world crashed down upon him, you know.

213
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Endless philosophical arguments,

214
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
endless neuroscientific arguments.

215
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,720
And I'm not going to go into any of them.

216
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
There's plenty.

217
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
There's hundreds and hundreds of articles

218
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
and several many books all about that one experiment.

219
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Still some pretty compelling evidence

220
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
for a starting point, wasn't it?

221
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
And did it convince Libet?

222
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Did he change his mind?

223
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
No, because he said that you could actually veto.

224
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
So he did some other experiments,

225
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
which I'll take too much time

226
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
if I go into explaining how they work.

227
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,720
But they indicated that although you couldn't initiate

228
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
the action with your free will,

229
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
just in time stop it in that 200 millisex bit,

230
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
you could just in time stop it happening.

231
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
So there's your free will,

232
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
which is why we had this conversation

233
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,720
about walking along the street.

234
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
And that comes on to the next bit of relevant research

235
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,720
from Daniel Wagner at Harvard a bit later

236
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
with his thought suppression experiments.

237
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Because this is kind of what Libet's talking about.

238
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
It's the ability to suppress the impulse to do something, right?

239
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Freddie, I want you for the next couple of minutes

240
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,720
please not to think about a white bear at all.

241
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
You mustn't think about a white bear, okay?

242
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Easy, no problem.

243
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
No white bears, isn't it?

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Okay, no white bears there.

245
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
So while we're talking,

246
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
if by any chance you should think about a white bear,

247
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
just go, will you tell me, okay?

248
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
But you're not going to are you,

249
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
because you're really, really good at thought suppression.

250
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,720
So what Libet did was he discovered that

251
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
it's really, really, really hard

252
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,720
not to think about something I'm not going to mention.

253
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
I just thought about it by the way, yeah.

254
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Yeah, yeah, right.

255
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
You're like everybody.

256
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,720
And that was one of his early experiments.

257
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,720
But what excites me about Wagner is his basic theory,

258
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,720
which is very straightforward,

259
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,720
that people attribute...

260
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Sorry, I'm stopping here

261
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,720
because it's really reminding me of the retreat I've just been on.

262
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Well, please feel free, Sue, to bring it in.

263
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Bring it in.

264
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
It's a synchronicity.

265
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Let me try and be clear about Wagner first though.

266
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,720
So he says that the way you decide

267
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
whether you have done something

268
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
or somebody else has done it

269
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
involves the timing.

270
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,720
So if you have a thought, for example,

271
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm going to have a drink of wine,

272
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
and all you people, it is six o'clock in the evening

273
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,720
and I'm allowed my glass of wine now.

274
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
So if you have a thought,

275
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm going to have a glass of wine,

276
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
and then the hand reaches out

277
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,720
and actually takes the glass,

278
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
the appropriate amount of time later,

279
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,720
you will attribute that to yourself, I did it.

280
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
Whereas if you reached out your hand

281
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
before you thought about it,

282
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
well, of course that does happen, doesn't it?

283
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
But that's the general principle.

284
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
And to find out whether that was true,

285
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
he did a whole series of experiments

286
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
where he could alter the time

287
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
by putting thoughts into people's heads

288
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
and making them move things.

289
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
He could alter the time gap,

290
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
and he showed that this is so,

291
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,720
that we do judge whether we did something ourselves

292
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
according to the appropriate timeline

293
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,720
between thought about doing the thing

294
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
and the thing happening.

295
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,720
That's a brilliant way to test it, clever.

296
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Yeah, and the experiments themselves were fascinating.

297
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,720
So his theory is that what happens

298
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
is that we attribute things to ourselves.

299
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,720
So it's the same thing as mixing up correlation and cause.

300
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Now, I'm sure you know that there's a problem

301
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
in every science.

302
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
You get a correlation between A and B.

303
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Let's say something really stupid,

304
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
like children who catch up

305
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
or do worse in their exams or something like that.

306
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
One explanation would be ketchup poisons your brain

307
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
and makes you do bad.

308
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Another one would be if you do badly in your exams,

309
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
you go and eat some chips

310
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
and pour lots of ketchup on them to cheer you up.

311
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Or it could be that both the cause

312
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
by something completely different,

313
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
which of course in that case would probably be poverty

314
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,720
or something to do with your home life or whatever.

315
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,720
But the general principle is absolutely there.

316
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
You have a correlation.

317
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
You can't know what the cause is.

318
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
You've got to do further experiments to find out.

319
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Now, he said in the case of free will,

320
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,720
what happens is we do the correlation and cause mistake.

321
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,720
We see the correlation between,

322
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,720
ah, I had that thought and a moment later,

323
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,720
it happened and I had the wine.

324
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,720
And we therefore conclude that my thought

325
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
caused the drinking of the wine.

326
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
But it didn't at all.

327
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Underlying brain processes already brewing up

328
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
and going, whatever they're doing,

329
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
caused as is compatible with Libet's experiment, of course,

330
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,720
caused both the thought and the action.

331
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
And the thought was quicker to cause

332
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
because it doesn't take so much bits of brain.

333
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
The action has to go, you know,

334
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
has to have the preparation in premote cortex

335
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
and get to them.

336
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
That's why the readiness potential takes quite,

337
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
can take quite a long time.

338
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,720
And so one comes after the other,

339
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
but the thought doesn't cause the action.

340
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
And this is a kind of very, very basic,

341
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,720
simple underlying foundation for a lot of free will.

342
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Probably not all of the free will works that way.

343
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,720
But that's why he said free will is an illusion.

344
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
And I agree with him.

345
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,720
But the question that me and I presume all the listeners

346
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,720
are asking now is who or what is making our decisions

347
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
if not our free will?

348
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Right.

349
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Well, here again, I'm thinking about the retreat

350
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,720
and the 40 years of meditation.

351
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Who or what?

352
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
This is the whole thing.

353
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I think to me, I've argued endlessly with Dan Dennis about this.

354
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Yeah, I hope you'd mention that

355
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,720
because I'm curious to know where you differ.

356
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Yeah, big time on this issue.

357
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
But God, I've even forgotten

358
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
what I was supposed to be answering now.

359
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
We've gone off it.

360
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,720
Well, the big question is who or what

361
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,720
if it's not our conscious, thoughtful mind,

362
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
if it's not the prefrontal lobe,

363
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
who is making the decision?

364
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Yeah, I think we need to discriminate very clearly

365
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,720
between the person, the whole physical thing,

366
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,720
this thing here, this biological creature

367
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,720
and the illusory self that seems to be inside and doing it.

368
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,720
And the whole point about free will to me,

369
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,720
if I ask an audience of people or my friends or whatever,

370
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
what's free will, the way they talk about it is like that.

371
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
It's I, it's me, it's this me

372
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
who's in here looking out through my eyes.

373
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
That's the one who has the free will.

374
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
And yes, I can tell my body to,

375
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
I can tell my arms to move.

376
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,720
But you can't tell your arms to move.

377
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Wegener has just given one way of explaining why not.

378
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
But if you think about the brain,

379
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
it's an amazingly complex, I mean,

380
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
billions of neurons with trillions of connections,

381
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
all doing their jobs.

382
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
I mean, in terms, I don't know why I've chosen the why.

383
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I'll pick up my pen instead.

384
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Otherwise I'll drink too much.

385
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,720
You know, think of all the different areas of the brain

386
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
that are involved in that.

387
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,720
And if I start to write something down,

388
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,720
that's going to involve masses of stuff.

389
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,720
I, this supposedly conscious entity,

390
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
do not know about any of that, frankly.

391
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
And I certainly don't know what's going on

392
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
in my digestive system.

393
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,720
And frankly, look, I mean, I'm moving my hands.

394
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
That's not me, some conscious little entity

395
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
in here moving the hand.

396
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,720
That hand is connected through all of this stuff,

397
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
cerebellum and all sorts,

398
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
to be doing these clever movements and moving.

399
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm not, look, I can move the pen like this.

400
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
What about something more complex,

401
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
like an impulse suppression with an ethical implication?

402
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
For example, you know, I, you know,

403
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,720
I want to have my third whiskey,

404
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
but I suddenly think, hmm,

405
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,720
actually that's probably going to be, you know,

406
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,720
showing me up as exaggerating a little.

407
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
And I choose not to for health reasons

408
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
or to not upset my loved ones or something.

409
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,720
There's an ethical component there.

410
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Is the suggestion that the brain itself,

411
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
in that complexity, you just described this,

412
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
this vast amount of unconscious activity

413
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
that's taking place all the time,

414
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
has an ethical dimension?

415
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Because presumably that is possible.

416
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Well, you're dividing processing into conscious and unconscious,

417
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
which is something I think also has to be thrown out,

418
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
but we can get to that.

419
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Yeah, I will avoid putting it that way.

420
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,720
But what I would say is people very often say,

421
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,720
well, it's all right after Libet and Wagner and, you know, whatever.

422
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,720
It's all right for simple things like moving a hand, you know,

423
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
but it doesn't apply to, you know,

424
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
shall I accept this marriage proposal?

425
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Do I want that job or that job?

426
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Ooh, should I spend this much money on this thing?

427
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
You know, whatever complicated,

428
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
or as you say, ethical moral decisions,

429
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
like I'll have the third glass of whiskey.

430
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
Why should they be any different?

431
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
They take longer, they're slower, they're more complex.

432
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I do remember, I have been trying personally to give up living with free will for 50 years.

433
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I can remember when my boyfriend, John Dupré, was,

434
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,720
he's now a philosophy professor at Exeter.

435
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,720
He was doing his undergraduate thesis on the weakness of the will.

436
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
And so this is a long, long, long, long time ago.

437
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,720
So we had wonderful arguments about free will.

438
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,720
And at that time, I had to make,

439
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,720
it wasn't with him, but I'd been having all these arguments.

440
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,720
And I had to make a very difficult decision about my life and my kids.

441
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
And it was really hard.

442
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,720
And I thought to myself, well, normally I'd make it,

443
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I'd think about all the advantages and disadvantages.

444
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,720
And then I thought, that's just what this brain and body in this world does.

445
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
It makes lists of advantages and disadvantages.

446
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,720
It's not done by free will.

447
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,720
It's done by a clever brain that's been brought up to think sensibly.

448
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,720
And it can do this and it will do it with or without free will.

449
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,720
So I sat down with a piece of paper and I wrote, you know,

450
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,720
advantages, disadvantages of doing what it was and made the decision.

451
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,720
And I think it's very natural to say, well, I made the decision,

452
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,720
but then you're back into inventing this non-existent self who lives in the brain.

453
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Because how could there be such a thing in there?

454
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
We do talk about this list as in episode one.

455
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,720
We look into the illusion of the self with Sue.

456
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,720
And I think that there's a lot to think about there.

457
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
So I think the two are very, very much connected.

458
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
So we're going to come back.

459
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Can I just stop you?

460
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,720
When you use the word illusion, the way I use the word illusion,

461
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
because I've got so many people saying,

462
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
well, you just don't believe it's such a thing.

463
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
And I'm not saying that.

464
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
So we look it up in the dictionary.

465
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
What's an illusion?

466
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
It's something that is not the way it appears to be.

467
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Something that's not what you think it is.

468
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
So it's just that you make a mistake.

469
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
It's not that there's nothing.

470
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,720
It's not that there isn't a problem of consciousness.

471
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
It's not that there isn't a problem of free will.

472
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,720
There are actions and choices and so on.

473
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,720
But I call it an illusion because it's not the magic it seems to be.

474
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,720
It is not some, you know, spiritual thing inside

475
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,720
that is kind of manipulating the synapses.

476
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
It wouldn't make sense.

477
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
But it's not that there's nothing.

478
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
It's not that there's no sense of self.

479
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
There's a sense of self.

480
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
The brain is constructing an idea.

481
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,720
It's constructing a body schema or, you know, this.

482
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,720
And it's monitoring the things that the mouth says

483
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
and it's doing all that stuff.

484
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,720
But it's not a little magical self with consciousness and free will.

485
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
That's what I mean by illusion.

486
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,720
That kind of understanding where there's a sort of two-tiered approach.

487
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,720
We're going to come back to because there are a lot of people

488
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,720
who like you accept that free will is an illusion

489
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
and yet go ahead and do that in the set.

490
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
But I want to quickly.

491
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I quickly want to cover another couple of things before we come back to that.

492
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,720
And the first and I think probably the most important to represent

493
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,720
is those who argue against these arguments from Libet,

494
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
from Wagner, from yourselves,

495
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
from yourself, from Sam Harris,

496
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,720
who are some of the most sort of vociferous,

497
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,720
argue for this most vociferously,

498
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
but at the same time,

499
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,720
there's also experimental evidence from Libet and Wagner.

500
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Tell me what are the main arguments?

501
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,720
I mean, you mentioned before, experience itself,

502
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,720
the sensation, the feeling that I have it is presumably the strongest.

503
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
I think it is for many people.

504
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,720
That is the strongest and it is very powerful.

505
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,720
I still get it occasionally and then I look at it and go,

506
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,720
oh, there's that sensation of free will.

507
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
But it's very much the same with self.

508
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Yes, the brain is building a representation of a self

509
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,720
that is doing the controlling and it isn't true.

510
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
And that's the way to look at it.

511
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,720
So one kind of argument is simply,

512
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,720
well, I know I've got free will and you get that quite a lot.

513
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
I know I've got free will.

514
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Then you have got Dennett's arguments,

515
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
which I think perhaps we ought to tackle,

516
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,720
reluctant as I feel in some ways to do so.

517
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Do represent him when you've been arguing.

518
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Exactly, I don't want to be unfair.

519
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
But I would like to mention,

520
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
I did a book called Conversations on Consciousness,

521
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,720
in which I interviewed about 20 of what were then,

522
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
this is some years ago now,

523
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,720
the top researchers in consciousness, including Wagner and Dennett

524
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,720
and all sorts of people, many that you've had on your show,

525
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,720
and will have, I gather.

526
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I asked them all the same questions,

527
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
or a few of the same questions with lots of other stuff.

528
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
And one of those questions was, do you have free will?

529
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,720
I didn't ask them, most of them, do you believe in free will?

530
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
I just said, do you have it?

531
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
And what was so interesting was all these super-intelligent,

532
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,720
amazingly clever, well-researched,

533
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,720
theoretically wonderful kind of people,

534
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,720
only a couple of people in there said no.

535
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,720
And I found that quite disturbing.

536
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,720
And the majority said,

537
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
yes, I've got free will,

538
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
and of those who said anything like,

539
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
well, I'm not sure, there was a lot of,

540
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,720
well, you know, but I have to believe,

541
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,720
I have to act as if I have free will.

542
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Patricia Churchland's a good example of this, isn't it?

543
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,720
She has extreme identity type theory of consciousness,

544
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
very much reductionist,

545
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,720
and I follow her in a lot of it,

546
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,720
but I was kind of amazed that she would say,

547
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
you have to live as a free will.

548
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,720
But in a way, I understand this fully

549
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,720
because actually throwing off the sensation of free will,

550
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,720
you know, really throwing it off is not,

551
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm still in the process.

552
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
I keep thinking, yeah, I've got rid of free will,

553
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,720
and then discovering new depths of the sort of feeling,

554
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,720
feeling that it can throw up.

555
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
So I do understand that.

556
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,720
But interestingly, one of the people involved was Dan Wegner,

557
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
and he said, I have to live as a free will.

558
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
And I pushed him and pushed him,

559
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,720
and he ended up saying something like,

560
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,720
and it was quite heartfelt at the time,

561
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
the way he was speaking,

562
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,720
that he had to make a very difficult family decision

563
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
that would affect other people,

564
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
and it was very difficult.

565
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,720
And that in the end, he,

566
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
honestly, people can go and read this in the book

567
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
and say that I've got it wrong,

568
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
so I guess it's like a long time ago.

569
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,720
But my recollection is he said something along the lines of,

570
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
in the end, I let the decision make itself,

571
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
and that was a certain freedom,

572
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
and it was all fine.

573
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,720
And it is, in Zen terms,

574
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
it's often described as let the universe do it,

575
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
or let the practice do it.

576
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,720
You know, you have to find something else to blame,

577
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
and blaming the practice of meditation

578
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,720
is quite innocuous compared with blaming an inner self

579
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
who has magical powers to control everything.

580
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
But there are more powerful reasons, aren't there?

581
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Dennett and Churchland give some quite important

582
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
institutional sort of society-based arguments

583
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,720
for why we should go ahead as if.

584
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Yes.

585
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,720
To some extent, I'm with them,

586
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,720
because you can't all at once give up free will

587
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
and still behave well.

588
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
And this may be one of the reasons why there's always

589
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
these ethical stuff that you're supposed to do

590
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
before you get into a meditation,

591
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
which, I mean, I'm not a Buddhist,

592
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
so I'm not done all that, taking vows,

593
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
and I'm not going to do that,

594
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
but I can understand why it might be necessary.

595
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,720
I think our upbringing in a civilized society should...

596
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
What are they worried about?

597
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
What are they worried about? Why is it so important?

598
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
What they're worried about is the whole of the legal system

599
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,720
breaking down and people running amok.

600
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
There's lots of reasons why people don't run amok

601
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,720
and go and run over old ladies on the road,

602
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
which is one example, I remember,

603
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,720
from a favorite book of mine by Guy Claxton.

604
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
And we don't run amok

605
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,720
and run over old ladies in the road for fun,

606
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,720
because we are a social species,

607
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
we have reciprocal altruisms,

608
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,720
all sorts of biological reasons why we will,

609
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
and the whole tend to behave well,

610
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
because it will, in the end, suit us.

611
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
But the legal question is very difficult,

612
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,720
and in the end, I think that that,

613
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,720
for you mentioned Pat and Dan,

614
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
for Dan, in the end, this is the reason,

615
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,720
and I think it's a very, very, very, very bad reason.

616
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,720
What would happen to our legal systems

617
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
if... I'll just talk about England,

618
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,720
because I know English law better than American or other laws,

619
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,720
but what would happen to it

620
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,720
if we were to say, right, nobody has free will,

621
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,720
that awful 17-year-old thug

622
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,720
who went and beat up the other gang member or whatever

623
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,720
didn't do it of his own free will?

624
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Well, why did he do it?

625
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,720
He did it because of his upbringing,

626
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
he did it because all his genes were this way,

627
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
all the memes he'd taken in

628
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
from all this gang warfare and everything else,

629
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,720
his parents were probably in some desperate strait as well

630
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,720
and not able to bring him up to have a clear understanding

631
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,720
of the consequences of his actions, any number of reasons.

632
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Now, would then society fall apart?

633
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,720
No. Okay, we need to punish him, why?

634
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Okay, let's say we think that five years in prison

635
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
would be the right punishment.

636
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Our reasoning would not be because he's a bad person

637
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
and of his own free will did something wicked.

638
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Our reason would be either he's so dangerous

639
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
we need to take him off the streets for a while

640
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
and try and help rehabilitate him

641
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,720
or it will be an incentive for him not to do it again

642
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,720
or it will be an incentive to other people not to do it.

643
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Now, it seems to me that those three reasons

644
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,720
should be perfectly adequate for a legal system to operate on

645
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
that would be compassionate,

646
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,720
that would understand why people end up doing terrible things

647
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,720
and that would help them.

648
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,720
And if we legalized all drugs and half the prison population,

649
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,720
sorry about that aside, but that's the best way to do it,

650
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,720
stop putting in people in jail for taking drugs

651
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
and we had enough spaces in prisons,

652
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,720
the rehabilitation could be really effective.

653
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
Somebody's had a really awful life

654
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
and brought up in such a way they end up,

655
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
they can't help it, they end up in a gang,

656
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
they were in this class at school and this happened

657
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
and they got sucked into that gang,

658
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
they got made into the county lines and they were,

659
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
blah, blah, blah,

660
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,720
maybe we could help to give them a better life in the future.

661
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,720
So I think the legal system would work better

662
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,720
if it didn't depend on the false concept of free will.

663
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,720
And Dan disagrees with me

664
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,720
and we have argued this at great length.

665
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Never gone to a resolution.

666
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
But Dan Danik goes further, doesn't he?

667
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
He actually believes free will is compatible

668
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
with the illusion of consciousness, doesn't he?

669
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,720
Yes, he does and it doesn't make any sense to me

670
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,720
because Dan, I think Consciousness Explained 1991

671
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
is a great book on consciousness.

672
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
I think it's still the best,

673
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,720
certainly one of the best books on consciousness ever.

674
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,720
He really goes to town on the nature of the self-illusion,

675
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,720
the non-existence audience in the Cartesian theatre

676
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,720
and the basic argument there is

677
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,720
even people who know neuroscience

678
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
and say they're not dualists,

679
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,720
they still imagine some kind of place in the brain or the mind

680
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,720
where it all comes together and I have the experience.

681
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
And this is what he calls the Cartesian theatre,

682
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,720
which doesn't exist, where I see the mental...

683
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,720
If I shut my eyes and imagine a green frog,

684
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
you know, it's my mental screen.

685
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Or if I'm looking out here, you know,

686
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,720
I'm experiencing this in my inner theatre.

687
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Bernie Barr's whole idea of theatre depends on this

688
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
and that's another whole argument.

689
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,720
So he's brilliant at showing that that is an illusion.

690
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
There isn't anybody in there.

691
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,720
So there isn't anybody to have free will.

692
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
You don't understand how he argues

693
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
because he's one of the best arguers on the planet.

694
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,720
How does he argue for a compatibilist argument?

695
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Well, what happens there is to go back

696
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,720
to what I was saying at the beginning of talking about free will,

697
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,720
which is to me, you have to separate out the idea of this thing here

698
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
and the inner self that is an illusion.

699
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
This isn't an illusion unless everything is,

700
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
but the inner self is.

701
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,720
And he agrees with that distinction.

702
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,720
So it is extraordinary to me that having been,

703
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,720
as it were, the greatest persuader

704
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,720
that the audience in the Cartesian theatre is an illusion,

705
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
he won't then say,

706
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,720
ah, but free will is part of that illusion.

707
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,720
And the way he argues is to keep on saying

708
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
what I could have done otherwise.

709
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,720
And in this situation, there was a choice.

710
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,720
And this leads me to think that his book called Freedom Evolves

711
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,720
should really have been called Choice Evolves.

712
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,720
I would say this thing here,

713
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,720
not this thing inside that doesn't exist,

714
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,720
this thing here makes choices all the time.

715
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
And when you asked about, well,

716
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,720
when this is happening, what's going on?

717
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Endless choices, the drinking of the wine,

718
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
the holding of the pen,

719
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
there's all kinds of massively parallel processes,

720
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
which he talks about in Conscience Explained.

721
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,720
They are responsible for what actions come out of this mouth

722
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
and these hands.

723
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,720
It just goes to show how compelling,

724
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
if even Dan Dennett,

725
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,720
the master of arguing us out of our illusion of consciousness,

726
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
can't accept this.

727
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,720
His experience is just too powerful for him to have a look at this.

728
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,720
It's not that, I don't think it's that,

729
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
because I think his experience is fine,

730
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
except that he won't take on the job of giving up free will.

731
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,720
But I think it's, he keeps conflating,

732
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,720
even though he knows there's a separation and difference

733
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,720
between the illusory inner self and the whole self,

734
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
he keeps conflating them and saying,

735
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,720
well, these choices are made by this person

736
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
and that counts as free will.

737
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
And that's where he and I differ.

738
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
He says the free will belongs to the whole person

739
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
and I say, no, it doesn't.

740
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,720
The free will is always people attributed to the enemy.

741
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,720
That's where I think we fall apart,

742
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
because I can't persuade him that if you really accept

743
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,720
the non-existent audience in the Cartesian theatre

744
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
as the one that's supposed to have the free will,

745
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
if you say this has the free will,

746
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,720
then you're going to say what he says,

747
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
which is, well, it went into the restaurant

748
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,720
and it could have chosen the spaghetti instead of the,

749
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
well, that's John Searle who uses that example,

750
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,720
but it's a choice, I say we are choice machines.

751
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
We're endlessly making choices all the time.

752
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
And in the end, I think he's terrified

753
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
that the society will fall apart.

754
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
And I've explained why I don't think it will.

755
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Sam Harris explains why he doesn't think it will.

756
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Lots of other people have explained why it might not.

757
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
It would be a big upheaval to change our legal systems,

758
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,720
but we'll have to, because they're getting ridiculous.

759
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
If you think of things like people say,

760
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
oh, well, I didn't mean to do something or other.

761
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,720
My prefrontal cortex made me do it.

762
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,720
You're still inventing this self who would be responsible

763
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,720
if their brain hadn't done something.

764
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
The more neuroscience we learn,

765
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,720
the more we're going to have to change our attitude

766
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
towards law and punishment and so on.

767
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
And it'll have to happen, it'll be difficult,

768
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
but it will have to happen.

769
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,720
But Dan thinks, I think he's...

770
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
I shouldn't really speak for him,

771
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
but I've had a lot of conversations with him.

772
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,720
A six-month back-and-forward email discussion last year.

773
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,720
But also, he's been here to my house several times,

774
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
and we've sat over the breakfast and argued about this.

775
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,720
And in the end, I think he comes down to...

776
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,720
He's too afraid of the consequences of people believing it's an illusion.

777
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Now, to some extent, there is reason to be cautious about that.

778
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,720
Difficult, but I would rather have the truth,

779
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
which is that it's illusion,

780
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,720
than pretend because I'm too scared of what the consequences will be.

781
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
And your version,

782
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
which we also touched on in episode one, Listers,

783
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,720
is a version based on compassion and collective responsibility,

784
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,720
which I think has to be the way we go in the future,

785
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
regardless of the status of free will anyway.

786
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,720
And hopefully, we could be right in saying

787
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,720
that that's the way culture is going.

788
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,720
I do hope that taking that positive line is, in fact, true.

789
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,720
Now, you are by no means the only one arguing that free will is an illusion.

790
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,720
For example, you've just mentioned the philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris,

791
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,720
and he has long held much to the chagra of everybody around him,

792
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,720
and he was very, very brave in holding this for a very long time,

793
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,720
that we'd be much, much less frustrated if we realized we didn't have free will.

794
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,720
And I don't think it's a coincidence that both of you are long-term meditators.

795
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,720
So in your opinion, what is it about the sort of mindfulness meditation approach

796
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,720
that helps us to associate less with this feeling that it's ourselves

797
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,720
following the trail of thought, the reasoning, and the decision-making?

798
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,720
What is it about meditation that makes you sort of less attached to that notion?

799
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
It's a long, slow road.

800
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,720
As I mentioned earlier, I've been meditating for more than 40 years

801
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,720
every day for 35 years and going on the streets.

802
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,720
And it's slow, but it does seem to be the most extraordinary unfolding process

803
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,720
that heads in this kind of direction.

804
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,720
So in terms of more straightforward mindfulness meditation,

805
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,720
because most of my practice has been in Zen, and that's a more specific kind of way,

806
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,720
but for any kind of meditation, letting go is one of the big difficulties,

807
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
and you have to let go of so much.

808
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,720
And a ghastly thought comes and keeps on coming, keeps on coming.

809
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
Let it go doesn't mean push it away.

810
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Let it go in meditation means...

811
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,720
Well, my original Zen teacher, Long Ben now, John Crook,

812
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,720
always used to say, let it come, let it be, let it go.

813
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,720
And what he meant by that was don't block things from coming.

814
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,720
When you feel them coming, that awful thought again, I don't want to think about it.

815
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,720
Don't block it, let it come, let it be.

816
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,720
In other words, don't do anything with it, don't hang on to it, cling to it,

817
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,720
make something out of it, elaborate it, blah, blah, blah, just let it, whatever.

818
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
And when it starts to fade away, don't hang on to it,

819
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,720
because, well, that's that terrible thought.

820
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Even a terrible one you can hang on to, or a really nice one, of course,

821
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,720
it's easier if you want to hang on to it, or like that, let it go.

822
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,720
So you become, from that very, very simple basic training,

823
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,720
sitting there hour after hour after hour with the dredges of your mind coming along,

824
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,720
that process of letting go is a fundamental part of most meditation parts.

825
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,720
And so when it comes to observing the mind, you see all these thoughts coming up,

826
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,720
but you also begin to observe impulses to do things,

827
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,720
and you can let them go, or ideas about the control that you have,

828
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,720
and you can observe them popping up.

829
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,720
And you can, I mean, one of the things that I only realized recently,

830
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,720
and this is quite a revelation, I mean, I'm saying that in the sense that,

831
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,720
you get these revelations in meditation, and they seem like, you know,

832
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,720
but I don't want to make it that bigger than it is,

833
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,720
but it was just something that really surprised me that I should have known already,

834
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,720
and I think that's very often the case when you get something and you go,

835
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,720
oh, wow, yeah, but why didn't I realize that before?

836
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,720
What I have found recently is,

837
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,720
I suppose as the mind slows down in deep practice and continuous practice,

838
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,720
it's easier and easier to see thoughts popping up and actions and so on.

839
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,720
And I've begun to observe much more clearly than I had before,

840
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,720
the process of attributing a thought to me.

841
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,720
So very often I'll now observe that my thinking is,

842
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,720
oh, I want to go and do something or other,

843
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,720
and I will just realize that that's come up and just let it go

844
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,720
in the context of, oh, the universe has thrown that up, this brain has thrown that up.

845
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,720
That's what's happening.

846
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:13,720
So instead of me thinking, I want a cup of tea, I'm going in the kitchen to get it,

847
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,720
the thought, if there's a thought at all, will be that's what's happening.

848
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,720
She's going into the kitchen to get the cup of tea.

849
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,720
So it's allowing the stuff to happen without the attribution.

850
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,720
And then you begin to see, like Wagner said, I mean, go straight back to Wagner's theory,

851
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:37,720
that it's about this false attribution, that it was my thought that caused it.

852
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,720
So then this particular little practice that I've found myself doing recently

853
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,720
is simply that, simply seeing the attribution happening and going,

854
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,720
oh, there's the attribution happening again.

855
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,720
And it all can be attributed to body, brain, and world.

856
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,720
It's all just happening.

857
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,720
That's bloody terrifying.

858
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,720
I mean, it's just happening.

859
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,720
And I can't see where it's going to go, what's going to happen.

860
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:13,720
But the reassuring thing is this person has been brought up in a sensible way,

861
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,720
can read and write and think straight and is reasonably moral,

862
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,720
tries to be good and kind and compassionate and let it happen.

863
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,720
And that's a matter of confidence and letting it happen.

864
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,720
And years and years and years of meditation can help with that.

865
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,720
That actually you are OK and reasonably nice person.

866
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,720
And you do bad things, everybody does.

867
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,720
But it's fine to let it happen.

868
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,720
And actually it's better to allow it to be the universe doing it

869
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,720
than to be constantly thinking about myself.

870
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
What shall I do now?

871
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,720
What am I?

872
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,720
Did I do the right thing?

873
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,720
All of that.

874
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Sorry, I've gone round the clock.

875
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,720
No, it was beautifully and it's clearly very, very personal

876
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,720
when you're talking about it from inside so many years of meditation.

877
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,720
It's very, very personal.

878
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,720
I get the same when I listen to Sam talking about this.

879
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,720
Do you guys differ on the free will position?

880
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,720
Or have you pretty much come to the same conclusion?

881
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,720
I don't know Sam very well.

882
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,720
I've only met him.

883
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,720
I think I've only met him once.

884
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,720
And we've not had big arguments.

885
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
We've corresponded.

886
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720
I've read his books.

887
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,720
I would say we're pretty close.

888
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,720
Yes.

889
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,720
I mean, his way of putting things over is very different from mine.

890
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,720
His attitude to religion is perhaps slightly.

891
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,720
No, I think basically, as far as free will is concerned,

892
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
I would say we basically would say the same.

893
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,720
And would you say he extrapolated because he started very much in meditation

894
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,720
before he came to philosophy and neuroscience?

895
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,720
Do you find that there's elements of the meditator mind

896
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,720
in the way he's arguing these things?

897
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,720
Oh, yeah.

898
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,720
Absolutely.

899
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,720
Totally.

900
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,720
Well, his books are full of it, aren't they?

901
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,720
Am I right in saying that the key here is identifying with the self

902
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,720
as the source of those ideas?

903
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Saying that's me talking.

904
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
That's me reasoning.

905
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,720
That's me choosing.

906
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,720
Is that the key to this sense of free will,

907
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,720
this association with that train of thought?

908
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,720
Yeah, exactly.

909
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,720
And that's really what Wagner was on about.

910
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,720
I mean, he kept it simpler than that, but that is precisely it.

911
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
Yes.

912
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,720
Every time we make an attribution to our self of a thought or a decision

913
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,720
or an action or whatever, we are giving strength to the illusory self.

914
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
And we're doing it all the time.

915
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:48,720
And dismantling that is tricky, but worth doing, I would say.

916
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,720
I mean, the people I know, and there are not very many who have let go

917
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,720
of the illusion of free will are not, they're great, lovely people.

918
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,720
They're not inhuman.

919
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,720
They're not really weird because they do not free will.

920
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,720
You wouldn't really know until you've got to know them.

921
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,720
I'm only saying that because I'm kind of wanting to reassure people that it's OK.

922
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,720
It's tricky.

923
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:21,720
And you do have to have a sense that your intentions are good.

924
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:26,720
But once it gets going, it's a kind of self, self-propelling process,

925
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
I think, the letting go.

926
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,720
Now, so I need to ask you about the Zen take on free will,

927
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,720
not least because some of my listeners have been asking,

928
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,720
saying, oh, can we get Sue back to talk more about Zen?

929
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
What's the Zen Buddhist perspective on this?

930
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,720
Which, I mean, I imagine you explored it a little bit in your 2011 book,

931
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Zen and the Art of Consciousness.

932
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,720
What does Buddhism have to say about free will?

933
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Nothing.

934
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,720
The simple answer is that because I can only say that because a good friend of mine,

935
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Stephen Batchelay, he wrote some of the viewers will know his books,

936
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Buddhism Without Belief and his other wonderful books.

937
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,720
He knows the various languages of Sanskrit and Pali and so on

938
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,720
and says that is no word for free will in those languages

939
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,720
in which the original suitors were written down.

940
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
So that's why I say nothing.

941
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
That's quite interesting, isn't it?

942
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,720
Not even a word.

943
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
It is very, very interesting.

944
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,720
Yeah, absolutely it is.

945
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,720
So in other words, their way of constructing things was rather different.

946
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:37,720
Nevertheless, there is the fundamental concept of dependent origination

947
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:42,720
or dependent arising within all forms of Buddhism, I think,

948
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
but I'm not a Buddhist scholar.

949
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,720
I must absolutely say that.

950
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,720
And almost all my practice has been in Zen,

951
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,720
although I've also done training in Mahamudra and in Janas practice

952
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
and various other things.

953
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,720
But even when it comes to Zen,

954
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,720
I know more about practice than I do about theory.

955
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,720
So don't take what I'm saying as kind of, you know,

956
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,720
a Buddhist scholar saying something they really know about.

957
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
Sue, do you mind if I just jump in there?

958
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,720
Because this is literally what I was about to ask you about.

959
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
As you've brought it up,

960
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,720
I wanted to ask you about this idea of dependent origination,

961
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,720
which was the Buddha's second great realisation alongside the first,

962
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,720
which is suffering, comes from attachment.

963
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,720
And the origin of this word dependent origination

964
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,720
is that a thing's origin depends on other things,

965
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,720
which depend on other things and so on in an infinite regress

966
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,720
rather than having any identity in itself.

967
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,720
So nothing has identity in and of itself,

968
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,720
but only interdependent in relation to other things.

969
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,720
Now, I had a very interesting mystical experience in my 20s,

970
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,720
which for any listeners interested,

971
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,720
I do discuss this with David Luke in our episode

972
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
on exceptional human experiences.

973
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,720
So do go and have a look at that if you're interested in peak experiences.

974
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,720
But essentially this experience showed me

975
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,720
that everything was dependently originated

976
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,720
and it was only years later when I was studying Buddhism at university

977
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,720
that I found this idea

978
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,720
and I learned that it was central to the Buddhist worldview.

979
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,720
So given the contents of your mystical experience,

980
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,720
which we touched on in episode one,

981
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,720
your extraordinary experience of becoming one with the universe

982
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,720
as you couldn't get the right size coming back into your body

983
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,720
and you end up expanding until you were one with the universe,

984
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,720
given that extraordinary experience

985
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,720
and the reports of so many others

986
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,720
and the new research into the relativity of space and time,

987
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,720
do you think that this understanding of an inseparable monism

988
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,720
could go some way to explain how we can be seemingly separate

989
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,720
and yet fundamentally inseparable from the rest of space and time?

990
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,720
Oh, I don't know, but I will say this.

991
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,720
I think what the Buddha saw and you saw, I didn't.

992
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,720
I mean, mine was a different kind of experience

993
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,720
and amazingly dramatic and very helpful

994
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,720
because I think all my life in a way has been...

995
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:12,720
I was shown that, I was just given this amazing experience

996
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,720
and in a way all my life has been trying to understand that in some way,

997
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,720
whether that's meditation or neuroscience or whatever in my life.

998
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,720
And that's been great.

999
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,720
But I think what the Buddha saw there and that you saw

1000
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,720
is absolute fundamental principle that underlies modern science

1001
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,720
and that he was, if you like, in a way the first scientist,

1002
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,720
the first one to think actually clearly

1003
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,720
because all cultures...

1004
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Well, generally speaking, cultures through all the ages,

1005
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,720
the natural way that people think about themselves

1006
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,720
is from early in childhood, we know now,

1007
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,720
is to think of themselves in dualist terms,

1008
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,720
that there's me inside and I do things and control things.

1009
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,720
And then, you know, many, many cultures have ideas of spirits

1010
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,720
and life after death and spirits that do things

1011
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,720
and that the rain is there because of a spirit and whatever.

1012
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,720
And he was basically just cutting through all of that

1013
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,720
and saying, no, there is no separate self at all.

1014
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
It's not what you think it is.

1015
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,720
And everything that happens happens from what was before.

1016
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,720
And it's not so much in my understanding that there's chains of causation.

1017
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,720
It's more about conditions. They talk about causes and conditions.

1018
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,720
Sir, cause of causation, maybe.

1019
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,720
Hang on, let's not get to that for a minute.

1020
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,720
But the basic idea of the conditions,

1021
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,720
out of these conditions arise this and out of these conditions arise this

1022
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,720
and the entire universe then you can see is everything is interdependent

1023
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,720
and everything arises because of everything else.

1024
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,720
That is the way, if I'm thinking about not having free will,

1025
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
that is the way that I'm thinking.

1026
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,720
Everything is arising as it must because that's the only way it can

1027
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,720
and that's what it's doing and there isn't any, I couldn't have done otherwise.

1028
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,720
That's just what happens.

1029
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,720
So then you said about the circle of, yeah,

1030
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,720
well, what's happened as far as I can see in the millennia of Buddhism

1031
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,720
is that what started out as a fairly straightforward idea

1032
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,720
with five links, I think, of things giving rise to things giving rise to things

1033
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,720
became elaborated, people do love this, they do now.

1034
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:35,720
There's a 12 link thing and recently I've become interested in dependent origination

1035
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,720
but I've always thought, what a load of crap, this gives rise to this

1036
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,720
and this gives rise to this and it goes round to the 12 of them.

1037
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,720
Why should there be 12?

1038
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,720
I just think, sorry, this is me being childish if you like

1039
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,720
but I've never wanted to know about that.

1040
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,720
I just think it's so much stuff, for example, in the Abhidharma and elsewhere

1041
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,720
which you can just look at it and think that's just people making stuff up,

1042
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,720
trying to make sense out of it.

1043
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,720
So I ignore all that stuff and that's why I keep saying I'm not a Buddhist scholar,

1044
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,720
I don't know all that stuff and I'm probably missing out on the most fantastic things

1045
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,720
but I'm much more interested in just getting on with seeing clearly

1046
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,720
and meditating in order to do so and being mindful.

1047
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,720
I didn't go into the details of all of the what I would call basically theological,

1048
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,720
obviously it's the Buddhist version but all of those Buddhist scholars who went on

1049
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,720
shortly after the Buddha died, it immediately became a massive argument

1050
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,720
and everybody was going into the cosmologies based on these ideas

1051
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,720
but I think the Buddha literally just saw it and that was it.

1052
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,720
Absolutely right and he said when people asked him questions about

1053
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,720
does the universe last forever or does it stop or those kind of questions

1054
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,720
he said I'm not going to answer them.

1055
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,720
I don't know.

1056
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,720
Yeah, exactly and now he might, I don't know if he were like,

1057
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,720
well there probably are enlightened people around now who might look at the physics

1058
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,720
and go yeah that makes sense or doesn't or whatever

1059
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,720
but he was very sensibly saying this is how I see it

1060
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:08,720
and it's actually easy to see if you look in the right way at anything.

1061
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,720
You can just see.

1062
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,720
I think it's not easy.

1063
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:23,720
That's wrong but let's suppose you can simplify your response to the world.

1064
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,720
I suppose I've shut my eyes because that immediately makes it simpler

1065
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,720
but it's possible with the eyes open as well

1066
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:35,720
and simply experience what's happening without words,

1067
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,720
without conceptualization, without making objects or things.

1068
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,720
It's amazingly hard to do.

1069
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,720
I shouldn't have implied that it's at all easy but in principle straightforward.

1070
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,720
What you find is it's pretty gappy.

1071
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,720
There's just little bits and pieces and noise here or whatever.

1072
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,720
We immediately make space.

1073
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,720
I think we can't avoid that although I think it may be possible

1074
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,720
but whatever the sound is is over there

1075
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,720
and this bottom sitting on this stool is here.

1076
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,720
Our whole brain is set up to do spatial awareness

1077
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,720
but even if you're still doing that,

1078
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,720
that noise doesn't have to be the fire crackling over there.

1079
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,720
What your brain is doing for obvious reasons for you to live in the world

1080
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,720
and get on with stuff is that's the fire.

1081
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,720
Was that a car outside or is that my husband coming and saying it's summertime

1082
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,720
or whatever but it's possible simply to sit there

1083
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,720
and there's just kind of sights and sounds and they have no meaning at all

1084
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,720
once all the words and conceptualizations have gone away.

1085
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,720
Then it's pretty obvious that it all just happens because it has to happen

1086
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
and it's not objects.

1087
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,720
The objects, this laptop in front of me, this pen,

1088
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,720
I need to be able to say that's a pen and I need to be able to write with it

1089
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,720
so that's the way my brain is working.

1090
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,720
The reason I mentioned this idea of an inseparable monism,

1091
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,720
listeners in our first episode,

1092
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,720
we discussed briefly the different positions on potential theories of consciousness

1093
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,720
and Sue said that she really wanted to try and find a monist solution.

1094
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,720
You know, dualism really is problematic.

1095
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,720
You've got the whole combination problem and it just really isn't where you want to end up.

1096
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,720
The reason I mentioned dependent origination is because for me personally,

1097
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,720
sitting inside that experience of it,

1098
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:40,720
I really felt that it was possible to have a scientific explanation

1099
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,720
for how some things could appear to give rise to others

1100
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,720
but within a network rather than a linear line,

1101
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,720
within a network of interconnected causation.

1102
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,720
That basically talks about a monism.

1103
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,720
So you've got separateness within a monism and that doesn't cause any problems

1104
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,720
and the only reason I find this so exciting now

1105
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,720
is that physics seem to be heading this direction.

1106
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,720
The implications of Einstein which we're going to be getting into on the show listeners

1107
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,720
really are still a bit like a free will question.

1108
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,720
They're terrifying.

1109
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,720
You know, you're like, oh my god, what do you mean that time isn't real

1110
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,720
and one of the most amazing implications of dependent origination

1111
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:27,720
is not only that all things in space are interconnected in causation

1112
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,720
but also all moments in time.

1113
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,720
That's from the beginning to the end.

1114
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,720
So the very first moment in time is as dependent on the last moment in time as everything else

1115
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,720
but Einstein's theory may well explain to us that time and space are an illusion anyway.

1116
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:47,720
So with that in mind, I'm finally finding some peace with this idea of a two-tiered reality

1117
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,720
where we have separateness and we have oneness.

1118
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:57,720
And I think dependent origination for me personally with that experience was the sort of bridge.

1119
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,720
Have you had anything similar to anything that kind of made you feel

1120
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,720
that there was a connection between separateness and oneness?

1121
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,720
Yes, but in the end, I don't get it.

1122
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:20,720
I still don't get how there can be experience and what underlies it all

1123
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,720
because it seems absolutely obvious that there is only experience.

1124
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,720
There's nothing else.

1125
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,720
I mean, I can't, you know, even a physicist with instruments, you know,

1126
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,720
reading the things and so on.

1127
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,720
It's all based on that.

1128
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,720
So why do we agree that there's a world out there?

1129
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,720
What is the fundamental underlying nature?

1130
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:51,720
I come then back to form and emptiness, that form, everything that we experience comes out of nothing.

1131
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,720
And that nothingness can be directly experienced as nothingness.

1132
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
There's nothing to say about it.

1133
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
But how does that work?

1134
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:08,720
And why do you fall on the side of nothingness rather than everythingness?

1135
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,720
I'm just saying that that's the Buddhist concept of form and emptiness.

1136
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,720
Actually, they're the same in the end.

1137
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,720
I mean, in the heart sutra, you know, form is emptiness and emptiness is form.

1138
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,720
Form is precisely emptiness and emptiness is precisely form.

1139
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,720
So also our sensation, perception, religion and consciousness.

1140
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,720
So that much seems clear.

1141
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:39,720
And then because then you find that in this moment, well, you know, if you really get into it,

1142
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,720
you can never find a moment.

1143
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:49,720
But if I allow there to be one inexperience, where does that come from?

1144
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,720
Out of nowhere.

1145
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,720
No, I'm I like mystery.

1146
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:05,720
I don't know whether if you if you noticed it, I mean, if you've seen my big consciousness textbook,

1147
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:10,720
it begins with perplexity, you know, get perplexed about this.

1148
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,720
It really is bad.

1149
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,720
And if you think it's bad, it's probably even worse than you think it is.

1150
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,720
And at the end, it ends with a little cartoon of someone saying, but what is it?

1151
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,720
And it ends with perplexity, because I don't think I mean, I'm not saying that you're wrong.

1152
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:31,720
I even agree with you that those really interesting ways that physics is going doesn't solve the mystery to me.

1153
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,720
I'm still bewildered.

1154
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,720
Yeah.

1155
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,720
That bewilderment pushes you on to try and keep going.

1156
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:41,720
And I'm trying and keeping going and wondering and being complex.

1157
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:47,720
And Sue, something you said in the first episode has come up really quite often about this.

1158
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,720
This ability to study consciousness from from this desire not to get into isms,

1159
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:59,720
because as soon as we associate with a mental construct, we are constricted by human thought,

1160
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:09,720
which unfortunately isn't capable, even at its highest level of understanding anything so complete from our one sided perspective.

1161
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,720
So I think when it made me laugh when you said, I don't get it because it's almost like,

1162
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,720
hang on, haven't you been saying there's nothing to get?

1163
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:25,720
Oh, well, if you end up with me looking like utterly confused, that's fine by me.

1164
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,720
It means we've had a good old chew of the chew of the gristle.

1165
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,720
If we if we get to that, I don't get it moment.

1166
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,720
Yeah.

1167
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Yeah.

1168
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,720
Well, I expect we'll have another one in due course, at least sorry, I should perhaps not invite myself,

1169
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,720
but it is fun talking to you.

1170
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,720
Well, it's very kind of you to be so enthusiastic.

1171
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:49,720
So I wanted to thank you for taking a punt on the podcast before we were even existent and just saying,

1172
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,720
yeah, let's go for it.

1173
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,720
It was really, really sweet of you.

1174
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:59,720
And I'm very, very touched to set to for you to say that it's exciting to talk to me because I'm such an amateur.

1175
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:07,720
And it just feels wonderful to have one's thoughts and perspectives and ideas validated by such a seasoned professional.

1176
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,720
And I have to say, Sue, I am going to ask you back for season three,

1177
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:20,720
because we still haven't had the chance to talk about possibly one of the most important things of your work,

1178
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:25,720
which is memetics, which you tackled in your 2010 book, The Meme Machine.

1179
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,720
So I really hope you mind coming back.

1180
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,720
1999.

1181
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,720
Oh, right.

1182
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,720
Okay.

1183
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:34,720
Right.

1184
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,720
Sorry, I've got that wrong.

1185
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,720
Of course, it's 1999.

1186
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,720
It's been a long time since you wrote that, hasn't it?

1187
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,720
Yeah, I'm getting back into that stuff now.

1188
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,720
So I'll happily talk about it.

1189
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:50,720
It's so relevant now with all of the information ecology that's going on and all of this wonderful,

1190
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
the media going independent.

1191
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,720
I mean, obviously there are lots and lots of challenges.

1192
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,720
And I think your work really is a useful kind of,

1193
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:06,720
it's almost like a tool, a sort of like, don't forget this while you're navigating all of this information.

1194
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,720
So I really want you to come back and talk about this, the way we pick up these memes that seem to confirm our biases.

1195
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:19,720
And then we retransmit them out into the world, sometimes completely unconsciously.

1196
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:26,720
I really wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was more relevant than ever to myself and to the listeners to get aware of that.

1197
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,720
I'm sure that the researchers come a long way since you, since you wrote that book.

1198
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,720
So Sue, it leaves me only to say thank you so much.

1199
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:46,720
Just back from a retreat coming on the show to explain this really, really, really difficult argument, ancient argument to the listeners

1200
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,720
and helping us really put ourselves on the spot and say,

1201
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:55,720
do we want to really live with this one or are we going to do what so many do and just say,

1202
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,720
well, let's just let's do it as if we had free will.

1203
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,720
I really don't know where I stand. I don't get it either. I've got no idea.

1204
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,720
I'm just going to say, I think it's great.

1205
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,720
So you've really helped me to just be like, I don't know.

1206
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
And it doesn't matter.

1207
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:19,720
And I think for somebody like yourself who's been pursuing those big questions from the start, it's actually a great relief

1208
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:30,720
because the kind of tormented philosopher really is just so pointless when you realise how much of this is just pure hot air.

1209
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,720
You're suffering unnecessarily. Would you agree?

1210
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1211
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,720
But maybe you have to go through that to come to something else.

1212
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,720
Right. Till next time.

1213
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,720
Thank you so much, Sue. See you next time.

1214
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,720
Bye.

1215
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,720
you
