0	12000	And what he found was fascinating that what happens first is the start of the activity
12000	19080	in the brain and then really only 200 milliseconds and very shortly before the action is the
19080	22240	time when you think you've decided to act.
22240	26920	In other words, the brains that started being ready to move before you make the decision
26920	27920	that you're going to move.
28400	32720	Now, this makes perfect sense in biological terms, it's perfectly ordinary result in a
32720	39880	way and the world crashed down upon him, you know, endless philosophical arguments, endless
39880	44960	neuroscientific arguments who said something along the lines of, in the end, I let the
44960	48800	decision make itself and that was a certain freedom and it was all fine.
50040	56240	And it is in Zen terms, it's often described as let the universe do it or let the practice
56240	57240	do it.
57240	62040	You know, you have to find something else to blame and blaming the practice of meditation
62040	67520	is quite innocuous compared with blaming an inner self who has magical powers to control
67520	68360	everything.
87240	96320	Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Chasing Consciousness.
96320	99400	I really hope you're enjoying this second series as much as I am.
99400	105240	And if you are, I would be extremely grateful if you can help me spread the word by sharing
105240	111000	these shows, rating them and maybe even reviewing us on iTunes podcast if you're an iTunes
111000	112000	person.
112000	117200	So today, we have the tough job of evaluating the evidence for the existence of free work
118160	123720	Now, as you know, the debate has raged for centuries in philosophy, but now with advances
123720	128180	in neuroscience and psychology experiments, we may have some actual physical evidence
128180	129680	to argue over.
129680	135760	Now we're also going to be getting into meditation and Zen as it seems that those who use some
135760	142240	kind of mindfulness meditation and hence they're used to watching the way their thoughts arise
142280	147280	and pass without actually identifying with them, they seem to be much less troubled by
147280	150320	the idea that they may not have free will.
150320	157320	So who better to explain this mind-boggling question than our first returning guest, psychologist,
157320	161720	author and visiting professor at Plymouth University, Susan Blackmore.
161720	166520	She's best known for her books The Meme Machine, Zen and the Art of Consciousness, Consciousness
166600	173200	and Introduction and Seeing Myself and her work spans across hundreds of different publications
173200	179200	in over 20 different languages, making great contributions in the fields of psychology,
179200	185200	memetics, religion, philosophy of mind, supernatural experience and many other areas.
185200	190700	Now, this problem has troubled me since I first started questioning it while studying philosophy
190700	196040	so I really can't wait to get into this with someone who's been wrestling with this problem
196080	199480	at the highest level of academia for over 20 years.
199480	201480	So without further ado, let's go.
208480	212040	Sue Blackmore, welcome back to Chasing Consciousness.
212040	215480	Thank you so much for joining us a second time.
215480	217040	You're very welcome.
217040	219320	Straight back from a Zen retreat.
219320	225720	How does it feel to come off straight out of a Zen retreat into talking about important philosophical stuff?
225720	228720	Is it an advantage or a disadvantage, I wonder?
228720	231720	We'll see, but it's been a few days.
231720	241720	I got back on Saturday evening and it carries on after the retreat and insights kind of come.
241720	246720	People often say this, you know, you work away and work away day after day, sitting, sitting, sitting
246720	248720	and some things shift and so on.
248720	254720	But actually it's afterwards the shifts go on and on and I'm still in that kind of shifting in the way
254720	256720	I'm seeing the world, which is rather interesting.
256720	263720	I'm rather looking forward to getting your reflections while you're still in that sort of very, very clear detached state.
263720	264720	I'm very curious.
264720	272720	So Sue has been on the show already and as a result, well, first of all, listeners, you must go back to the first episode
272720	279720	and hear Sue's extraordinary rendition of her out-of-body experience, now famous out-of-body experience
279720	283720	and her insight into the hard problem of consciousness.
283720	289720	But because of that, Sue, you've already answered my usual first question about formative influences.
289720	293720	So I wanted to ask you something a bit differently, mostly because I know you love these mind games.
293720	302720	I've been pernumbulating recently a lot about maturity and how radically we can change our approach to certain things as we get older.
302720	304720	So I'd like you to ask you this.
304720	312720	Can you choose one of those first memorable, formative, big questions from those intense teenage years
312720	320720	that really gripped you and try and compare how you thought about it then to how you thought about it now?
320720	322720	Yeah.
322720	332720	If I strictly take the teenage years, I did wonder about patterns and why birds were flying in a V shape
332720	336720	and was there some strange, you know, patterning going on in the world?
336720	337720	It turns out there isn't.
337720	339720	I mean, not in that sense at any rate.
339720	346720	We know exactly why they fly in V formations now, which is a mixture of physics and how their brains work.
346720	349720	But I think this is probably 20.
349720	351720	So I think I hope that will count.
351720	354720	I became obsessed with the question of memory.
354720	356720	How does memory work?
356720	360720	In a way now, I would think of it as a question to do with consciousness, which I didn't really think about then.
360720	362720	And you were not allowed to talk about consciousness.
362720	366720	We're talking 1970, 71-ish.
366720	370720	Consciousness was not mentioned in a psychology degree in those days.
370720	373720	So it's perhaps not surprising I didn't think about it that way.
373720	377720	But I can remember standing outside the psychology department in Oxford and thinking,
377720	378720	I remember this place.
378720	380720	I remember going in there yesterday.
380720	381720	How does a brain do that?
381720	382720	What's going on?
382720	383720	What is memory?
383720	388720	And I was making up all these theories about memory being outside of the brain, psychic kind of theories.
388720	392720	Because I was really into all that psychic stuff, as you know, after the outer body experience.
392720	394720	I believed all these things.
394720	396720	So I had all these kind of psychic theories.
396720	401720	And the actual science that was going on then was rubbish.
401720	406720	There was talk about chopping up planarian worms and that memory was stored in RNA
406720	408720	and that the molecules were storing the information,
408720	412720	which is obviously crazy because you couldn't get the information out fast enough.
412720	417720	I can ask you, what's the number of your house?
418720	419720	Well, you're very slow.
419720	422720	But you know, what's the capital of France?
422720	425720	You haven't got a brain at all.
425720	427720	You've got RNA working in there.
427720	428720	I've got no memory.
428720	430720	I even lived there.
430720	431720	How old are you?
431720	433720	44.
433720	435720	Well, that was a bit quicker.
435720	440720	The point is, those theories were kind of impossible to work
440720	442720	and they didn't have better theories.
442720	447720	And so I was really getting carried away with memory is out there and all our memories are shared.
447720	452720	And ESP is really only a special case of the more general concepts of memory.
452720	459720	And sorry, the other way round, our private memories are a special case of the general availability of all it.
459720	463720	I mean, that was equally crap from, you know, but that was my obsession.
463720	469720	And I nearly did a PhD, took a PhD place to study memory at Sussex University.
469720	473720	And I turned it down because I wanted to prove the paranormal was true.
473720	476720	And so that was my obsession.
476720	479720	Now we have a really good idea and there's so much more to learn,
479720	485720	but we really understand about dendritic growth and how the connections between neurons,
485720	493720	synaptic strength is altered and the fascinating mixture of digital and log processes going on in brains.
493720	496720	And, you know, I mean, it's making sense now.
496720	498720	So it's definitely a full conversation.
498720	504720	It's definitely something we're going to have to look into on chasing consciousness to be complete in our work.
504720	509720	So it's it's going to be a whole show on the different series of memory.
509720	513720	You're never going to be complete.
513720	515720	That I can imagine.
515720	519720	So as you know, OK, what next are you going to tempt me with?
519720	521720	Right, straight to the big one.
521720	523720	Free will.
523720	527720	The argument has, of course, raged for centuries in philosophy.
527720	532720	But rather than getting to those conceptual arguments, which are human mental constructs,
532720	536720	let's go to the more recent experiments in psychology and neuroscience
536720	540720	that, in your opinion, give us physical proof that free will is an illusion.
540720	544720	I think Libit is probably the best place to start, right?
544720	545720	Poor fellow.
545720	549720	He actually set out to prove that free will was real, didn't he?
549720	550720	He did.
550720	553720	I'm shaking my head because I don't think there's any proof.
553720	556720	And I'm not going to claim there's any proof.
556720	559720	OK, so that's too strong a word.
559720	560720	Yes, exactly.
560720	564720	I mean, just to set it up, you mentioned that it's been going on a long time.
564720	565720	I mean, I love it.
565720	570720	Samuel Johnson in the 18th century said something like,
570720	573720	all theory is against freedom of the will.
573720	575720	All experience is for it.
575720	578720	Now, he didn't have any neuroscience.
578720	581720	He was just looking at the world, as you might with dependent origination,
581720	582720	as you mentioned.
582720	587720	But you can look at the world and see how it operates and think there can't be free will.
587720	592720	And he could do that 200 years ago, more than 200 years ago.
592720	596720	Now, we have so much neuroscience and so much more evidence.
596720	599720	The problem is, yes, there can't be free will.
599720	604720	But people still go on believing in it against all the odds.
604720	609720	And I can't prove it because of that, because they'll always come up with,
609720	611720	oh, yes, but what about my experience?
611720	613720	Anyway, Libet.
613720	615720	So Libet, a lovely man.
615720	618720	I have met him a couple of times.
618720	624720	I had a wonderful walk with him in San Francisco near the Golden Gate Bridge.
624720	626720	And we were walking along this road.
626720	630720	And there was a little kid further up the pavement.
630720	636720	And he said something like, to give you an example of what he believes about it,
636720	643720	he said, the experiments may show that I'm not free to think what to do,
643720	645720	but I can stop myself doing things.
645720	650720	For example, if I had an impulse to want to go and murder that little girl,
650720	654720	if I was a wicked person, a murderer, but I could stop myself.
654720	656720	And that's the important part of free will.
656720	659720	So he was kind of hedging his bets at that point.
659720	666720	And why I say it was lovely conversations with him is because he really cared about it.
666720	670720	And so he did these experiments, as you point out,
670720	672720	because he was trying to prove that there was free will.
672720	675720	And I expect most of your listeners will know his experiments,
675720	678720	but very briefly, we're talking them early to mid-80s.
678720	683720	And what he did was he asked people to do a simple action,
683720	687720	because whenever they wanted to, of their own free will,
687720	690720	spontaneously, deliberately, to flex their wrist.
690720	693720	They didn't have a choice about what to do.
693720	696720	They only had a choice about when to do it.
696720	700720	But that's all he could do because he didn't have brain scans.
700720	702720	He only had EEG.
702720	707720	So he had EEG on the head to look at the motor strip
707720	712720	when the action would start there, the readiness potential will start.
712720	714720	So you have a readiness potential.
714720	717720	If you imagine a graph, it's like building up, building up, building up,
717720	719720	and then the action happens.
719720	723720	And that can go up to a second before the action takes place.
723720	726720	So he measured the time of that happening in the brain.
726720	731720	He measured with an electrode on the wrist the time of the movement.
731720	738720	And then he had to try and measure when the person made the decision to move.
738720	741720	Now, that's why his experiments are, I would say still,
741720	746720	the most famous experiments ever done on consciousness.
746720	748720	The way he measured it was very clever.
748720	751720	He had a spot revolving on a screen,
751720	756720	and he asked people to shout out, we'll say,
756720	760720	where the spot was when they decided to act.
760720	763720	And what's critical about this method is,
763720	765720	it's no good pressing a lever or something,
765720	770720	it's a lag the same way as the lag that's going on in the movement.
770720	773720	But this way you reported after the fact.
773720	776720	So the spots going round, you make a movement,
776720	780720	and afterwards you say, oh, I decided when the spot was at four,
780720	783720	or six, or nine, or whatever it was.
783720	785720	So I often in lectures have had like,
785720	787720	I got 100 or however many people sitting there,
787720	790720	and all going like this, and I asked them to shout out,
790720	794720	and I'll go like this, and I'll be the spot.
794720	797720	And then I say, shout out where it was when you decided.
797720	801720	And they got here, 12, 5, 7, you know, people can do it.
801720	803720	One of the philosophical objections is they can't do it.
803720	805720	They can do it easily.
805720	812720	And what he found was fascinating that what happens first
812720	815720	is the start of the activity in the brain.
815720	819720	And then really only 200 milliseconds,
819720	821720	and very shortly before the action is the time
821720	823720	when you think you've decided to act.
823720	827720	In other words, the brains that started being ready to move
827720	830720	before you make the decision that you're going to move.
830720	832720	Now, this makes perfect sense in biological terms.
832720	835720	It's perfectly ordinary result in a way.
835720	839720	And the world crashed down upon him, you know.
839720	841720	Endless philosophical arguments,
841720	843720	endless neuroscientific arguments.
843720	846720	And I'm not going to go into any of them.
846720	847720	There's plenty.
847720	850720	There's hundreds and hundreds of articles
850720	853720	and several many books all about that one experiment.
853720	855720	Still some pretty compelling evidence
855720	857720	for a starting point, wasn't it?
857720	858720	And did it convince Libet?
858720	860720	Did he change his mind?
860720	863720	No, because he said that you could actually veto.
863720	865720	So he did some other experiments,
865720	867720	which I'll take too much time
867720	869720	if I go into explaining how they work.
869720	873720	But they indicated that although you couldn't initiate
873720	875720	the action with your free will,
875720	877720	just in time stop it in that 200 millisex bit,
877720	879720	you could just in time stop it happening.
879720	881720	So there's your free will,
881720	883720	which is why we had this conversation
883720	886720	about walking along the street.
886720	890720	And that comes on to the next bit of relevant research
890720	893720	from Daniel Wagner at Harvard a bit later
893720	896720	with his thought suppression experiments.
896720	898720	Because this is kind of what Libet's talking about.
898720	901720	It's the ability to suppress the impulse to do something, right?
901720	904720	Freddie, I want you for the next couple of minutes
904720	908720	please not to think about a white bear at all.
908720	910720	You mustn't think about a white bear, okay?
910720	912720	Easy, no problem.
912720	914720	No white bears, isn't it?
914720	915720	Okay, no white bears there.
915720	916720	So while we're talking,
916720	918720	if by any chance you should think about a white bear,
918720	920720	just go, will you tell me, okay?
920720	921720	But you're not going to are you,
921720	923720	because you're really, really good at thought suppression.
923720	927720	So what Libet did was he discovered that
927720	930720	it's really, really, really hard
930720	933720	not to think about something I'm not going to mention.
933720	935720	I just thought about it by the way, yeah.
935720	937720	Yeah, yeah, right.
937720	939720	You're like everybody.
939720	942720	And that was one of his early experiments.
942720	947720	But what excites me about Wagner is his basic theory,
947720	950720	which is very straightforward,
950720	956720	that people attribute...
956720	957720	Sorry, I'm stopping here
957720	961720	because it's really reminding me of the retreat I've just been on.
961720	964720	Well, please feel free, Sue, to bring it in.
964720	965720	Bring it in.
965720	967720	It's a synchronicity.
967720	970720	Let me try and be clear about Wagner first though.
970720	973720	So he says that the way you decide
973720	975720	whether you have done something
975720	977720	or somebody else has done it
977720	980720	involves the timing.
980720	985720	So if you have a thought, for example,
985720	987720	I'm going to have a drink of wine,
987720	989720	and all you people, it is six o'clock in the evening
989720	993720	and I'm allowed my glass of wine now.
993720	994720	So if you have a thought,
994720	996720	I'm going to have a glass of wine,
996720	997720	and then the hand reaches out
997720	1000720	and actually takes the glass,
1000720	1003720	the appropriate amount of time later,
1003720	1006720	you will attribute that to yourself, I did it.
1006720	1008720	Whereas if you reached out your hand
1008720	1009720	before you thought about it,
1009720	1011720	well, of course that does happen, doesn't it?
1011720	1013720	But that's the general principle.
1013720	1015720	And to find out whether that was true,
1015720	1017720	he did a whole series of experiments
1017720	1020720	where he could alter the time
1020720	1022720	by putting thoughts into people's heads
1022720	1023720	and making them move things.
1023720	1025720	He could alter the time gap,
1025720	1026720	and he showed that this is so,
1026720	1030720	that we do judge whether we did something ourselves
1030720	1032720	according to the appropriate timeline
1032720	1035720	between thought about doing the thing
1035720	1037720	and the thing happening.
1037720	1040720	That's a brilliant way to test it, clever.
1040720	1043720	Yeah, and the experiments themselves were fascinating.
1043720	1047720	So his theory is that what happens
1047720	1049720	is that we attribute things to ourselves.
1049720	1054720	So it's the same thing as mixing up correlation and cause.
1054720	1057720	Now, I'm sure you know that there's a problem
1057720	1058720	in every science.
1058720	1062720	You get a correlation between A and B.
1062720	1067720	Let's say something really stupid,
1067720	1069720	like children who catch up
1069720	1071720	or do worse in their exams or something like that.
1072720	1074720	One explanation would be ketchup poisons your brain
1074720	1075720	and makes you do bad.
1075720	1079720	Another one would be if you do badly in your exams,
1079720	1080720	you go and eat some chips
1080720	1083720	and pour lots of ketchup on them to cheer you up.
1083720	1084720	Or it could be that both the cause
1084720	1086720	by something completely different,
1086720	1088720	which of course in that case would probably be poverty
1088720	1092720	or something to do with your home life or whatever.
1092720	1097720	But the general principle is absolutely there.
1097720	1098720	You have a correlation.
1098720	1100720	You can't know what the cause is.
1100720	1102720	You've got to do further experiments to find out.
1102720	1104720	Now, he said in the case of free will,
1104720	1107720	what happens is we do the correlation and cause mistake.
1107720	1110720	We see the correlation between,
1110720	1113720	ah, I had that thought and a moment later,
1113720	1116720	it happened and I had the wine.
1116720	1119720	And we therefore conclude that my thought
1119720	1121720	caused the drinking of the wine.
1121720	1123720	But it didn't at all.
1123720	1126720	Underlying brain processes already brewing up
1126720	1128720	and going, whatever they're doing,
1128720	1132720	caused as is compatible with Libet's experiment, of course,
1132720	1137720	caused both the thought and the action.
1137720	1139720	And the thought was quicker to cause
1139720	1141720	because it doesn't take so much bits of brain.
1141720	1143720	The action has to go, you know,
1143720	1145720	has to have the preparation in premote cortex
1145720	1146720	and get to them.
1146720	1148720	That's why the readiness potential takes quite,
1148720	1149720	can take quite a long time.
1149720	1152720	And so one comes after the other,
1152720	1156720	but the thought doesn't cause the action.
1156720	1159720	And this is a kind of very, very basic,
1159720	1162720	simple underlying foundation for a lot of free will.
1162720	1164720	Probably not all of the free will works that way.
1164720	1167720	But that's why he said free will is an illusion.
1167720	1169720	And I agree with him.
1169720	1172720	But the question that me and I presume all the listeners
1172720	1178720	are asking now is who or what is making our decisions
1178720	1180720	if not our free will?
1180720	1182720	Right.
1182720	1185720	Well, here again, I'm thinking about the retreat
1185720	1188720	and the 40 years of meditation.
1188720	1189720	Who or what?
1189720	1190720	This is the whole thing.
1190720	1196720	I think to me, I've argued endlessly with Dan Dennis about this.
1196720	1198720	Yeah, I hope you'd mention that
1198720	1203720	because I'm curious to know where you differ.
1203720	1207720	Yeah, big time on this issue.
1207720	1209720	But God, I've even forgotten
1209720	1211720	what I was supposed to be answering now.
1211720	1213720	We've gone off it.
1213720	1217720	Well, the big question is who or what
1217720	1221720	if it's not our conscious, thoughtful mind,
1221720	1223720	if it's not the prefrontal lobe,
1223720	1225720	who is making the decision?
1225720	1229720	Yeah, I think we need to discriminate very clearly
1229720	1233720	between the person, the whole physical thing,
1233720	1237720	this thing here, this biological creature
1237720	1242720	and the illusory self that seems to be inside and doing it.
1242720	1245720	And the whole point about free will to me,
1245720	1250720	if I ask an audience of people or my friends or whatever,
1250720	1254720	what's free will, the way they talk about it is like that.
1254720	1256720	It's I, it's me, it's this me
1256720	1258720	who's in here looking out through my eyes.
1258720	1260720	That's the one who has the free will.
1260720	1262720	And yes, I can tell my body to,
1262720	1264720	I can tell my arms to move.
1264720	1267720	But you can't tell your arms to move.
1267720	1271720	Wegener has just given one way of explaining why not.
1271720	1273720	But if you think about the brain,
1273720	1275720	it's an amazingly complex, I mean,
1275720	1277720	billions of neurons with trillions of connections,
1277720	1279720	all doing their jobs.
1279720	1281720	I mean, in terms, I don't know why I've chosen the why.
1281720	1283720	I'll pick up my pen instead.
1283720	1285720	Otherwise I'll drink too much.
1285720	1288720	You know, think of all the different areas of the brain
1288720	1289720	that are involved in that.
1289720	1292720	And if I start to write something down,
1292720	1295720	that's going to involve masses of stuff.
1295720	1298720	I, this supposedly conscious entity,
1298720	1300720	do not know about any of that, frankly.
1300720	1302720	And I certainly don't know what's going on
1302720	1303720	in my digestive system.
1303720	1306720	And frankly, look, I mean, I'm moving my hands.
1306720	1309720	That's not me, some conscious little entity
1309720	1311720	in here moving the hand.
1311720	1314720	That hand is connected through all of this stuff,
1314720	1316720	cerebellum and all sorts,
1316720	1318720	to be doing these clever movements and moving.
1318720	1320720	I'm not, look, I can move the pen like this.
1320720	1322720	What about something more complex,
1322720	1326720	like an impulse suppression with an ethical implication?
1326720	1329720	For example, you know, I, you know,
1329720	1333720	I want to have my third whiskey,
1333720	1335720	but I suddenly think, hmm,
1335720	1338720	actually that's probably going to be, you know,
1338720	1341720	showing me up as exaggerating a little.
1341720	1344720	And I choose not to for health reasons
1344720	1346720	or to not upset my loved ones or something.
1346720	1349720	There's an ethical component there.
1349720	1352720	Is the suggestion that the brain itself,
1352720	1354720	in that complexity, you just described this,
1354720	1356720	this vast amount of unconscious activity
1356720	1358720	that's taking place all the time,
1358720	1360720	has an ethical dimension?
1360720	1362720	Because presumably that is possible.
1362720	1366720	Well, you're dividing processing into conscious and unconscious,
1366720	1368720	which is something I think also has to be thrown out,
1368720	1370720	but we can get to that.
1370720	1373720	Yeah, I will avoid putting it that way.
1373720	1377720	But what I would say is people very often say,
1377720	1380720	well, it's all right after Libet and Wagner and, you know, whatever.
1380720	1384720	It's all right for simple things like moving a hand, you know,
1384720	1386720	but it doesn't apply to, you know,
1386720	1388720	shall I accept this marriage proposal?
1388720	1390720	Do I want that job or that job?
1390720	1394720	Ooh, should I spend this much money on this thing?
1394720	1396720	You know, whatever complicated,
1396720	1398720	or as you say, ethical moral decisions,
1398720	1401720	like I'll have the third glass of whiskey.
1401720	1404720	Why should they be any different?
1404720	1406720	They take longer, they're slower, they're more complex.
1407720	1415720	I do remember, I have been trying personally to give up living with free will for 50 years.
1415720	1420720	I can remember when my boyfriend, John Dupré, was,
1420720	1424720	he's now a philosophy professor at Exeter.
1424720	1430720	He was doing his undergraduate thesis on the weakness of the will.
1430720	1433720	And so this is a long, long, long, long time ago.
1433720	1437720	So we had wonderful arguments about free will.
1437720	1444720	And at that time, I had to make,
1444720	1447720	it wasn't with him, but I'd been having all these arguments.
1447720	1453720	And I had to make a very difficult decision about my life and my kids.
1453720	1455720	And it was really hard.
1455720	1459720	And I thought to myself, well, normally I'd make it,
1459720	1462720	I'd think about all the advantages and disadvantages.
1462720	1468720	And then I thought, that's just what this brain and body in this world does.
1468720	1471720	It makes lists of advantages and disadvantages.
1471720	1473720	It's not done by free will.
1473720	1478720	It's done by a clever brain that's been brought up to think sensibly.
1478720	1481720	And it can do this and it will do it with or without free will.
1481720	1484720	So I sat down with a piece of paper and I wrote, you know,
1484720	1489720	advantages, disadvantages of doing what it was and made the decision.
1490720	1494720	And I think it's very natural to say, well, I made the decision,
1494720	1499720	but then you're back into inventing this non-existent self who lives in the brain.
1499720	1502720	Because how could there be such a thing in there?
1502720	1504720	We do talk about this list as in episode one.
1504720	1508720	We look into the illusion of the self with Sue.
1508720	1512720	And I think that there's a lot to think about there.
1512720	1514720	So I think the two are very, very much connected.
1514720	1516720	So we're going to come back.
1516720	1518720	Can I just stop you?
1518720	1521720	When you use the word illusion, the way I use the word illusion,
1521720	1523720	because I've got so many people saying,
1523720	1525720	well, you just don't believe it's such a thing.
1525720	1526720	And I'm not saying that.
1526720	1528720	So we look it up in the dictionary.
1528720	1529720	What's an illusion?
1529720	1531720	It's something that is not the way it appears to be.
1531720	1533720	Something that's not what you think it is.
1533720	1535720	So it's just that you make a mistake.
1535720	1536720	It's not that there's nothing.
1536720	1538720	It's not that there isn't a problem of consciousness.
1538720	1540720	It's not that there isn't a problem of free will.
1540720	1543720	There are actions and choices and so on.
1543720	1547720	But I call it an illusion because it's not the magic it seems to be.
1547720	1552720	It is not some, you know, spiritual thing inside
1552720	1555720	that is kind of manipulating the synapses.
1555720	1557720	It wouldn't make sense.
1557720	1559720	But it's not that there's nothing.
1559720	1561720	It's not that there's no sense of self.
1561720	1562720	There's a sense of self.
1562720	1564720	The brain is constructing an idea.
1564720	1567720	It's constructing a body schema or, you know, this.
1567720	1571720	And it's monitoring the things that the mouth says
1571720	1573720	and it's doing all that stuff.
1573720	1578720	But it's not a little magical self with consciousness and free will.
1578720	1580720	That's what I mean by illusion.
1580720	1586720	That kind of understanding where there's a sort of two-tiered approach.
1586720	1589720	We're going to come back to because there are a lot of people
1589720	1593720	who like you accept that free will is an illusion
1593720	1596720	and yet go ahead and do that in the set.
1596720	1598720	But I want to quickly.
1598720	1602720	I quickly want to cover another couple of things before we come back to that.
1602720	1606720	And the first and I think probably the most important to represent
1606720	1610720	is those who argue against these arguments from Libet,
1610720	1612720	from Wagner, from yourselves,
1612720	1614720	from yourself, from Sam Harris,
1614720	1618720	who are some of the most sort of vociferous,
1618720	1621720	argue for this most vociferously,
1621720	1623720	but at the same time,
1623720	1627720	there's also experimental evidence from Libet and Wagner.
1627720	1630720	Tell me what are the main arguments?
1630720	1633720	I mean, you mentioned before, experience itself,
1633720	1637720	the sensation, the feeling that I have it is presumably the strongest.
1637720	1639720	I think it is for many people.
1639720	1642720	That is the strongest and it is very powerful.
1642720	1646720	I still get it occasionally and then I look at it and go,
1646720	1649720	oh, there's that sensation of free will.
1649720	1652720	But it's very much the same with self.
1652720	1657720	Yes, the brain is building a representation of a self
1657720	1660720	that is doing the controlling and it isn't true.
1660720	1663720	And that's the way to look at it.
1663720	1666720	So one kind of argument is simply,
1666720	1669720	well, I know I've got free will and you get that quite a lot.
1669720	1671720	I know I've got free will.
1671720	1674720	Then you have got Dennett's arguments,
1674720	1676720	which I think perhaps we ought to tackle,
1676720	1679720	reluctant as I feel in some ways to do so.
1679720	1682720	Do represent him when you've been arguing.
1682720	1684720	Exactly, I don't want to be unfair.
1684720	1687720	But I would like to mention,
1687720	1689720	I did a book called Conversations on Consciousness,
1689720	1693720	in which I interviewed about 20 of what were then,
1693720	1695720	this is some years ago now,
1695720	1699720	the top researchers in consciousness, including Wagner and Dennett
1699720	1704720	and all sorts of people, many that you've had on your show,
1704720	1707720	and will have, I gather.
1707720	1709720	I asked them all the same questions,
1709720	1712720	or a few of the same questions with lots of other stuff.
1712720	1715720	And one of those questions was, do you have free will?
1715720	1718720	I didn't ask them, most of them, do you believe in free will?
1718720	1720720	I just said, do you have it?
1720720	1724720	And what was so interesting was all these super-intelligent,
1724720	1727720	amazingly clever, well-researched,
1727720	1731720	theoretically wonderful kind of people,
1731720	1735720	only a couple of people in there said no.
1735720	1738720	And I found that quite disturbing.
1738720	1742720	And the majority said,
1742720	1744720	yes, I've got free will,
1744720	1746720	and of those who said anything like,
1746720	1749720	well, I'm not sure, there was a lot of,
1749720	1753720	well, you know, but I have to believe,
1753720	1756720	I have to act as if I have free will.
1756720	1760720	Patricia Churchland's a good example of this, isn't it?
1760720	1766720	She has extreme identity type theory of consciousness,
1766720	1768720	very much reductionist,
1768720	1771720	and I follow her in a lot of it,
1771720	1775720	but I was kind of amazed that she would say,
1775720	1777720	you have to live as a free will.
1777720	1780720	But in a way, I understand this fully
1780720	1785720	because actually throwing off the sensation of free will,
1785720	1788720	you know, really throwing it off is not,
1788720	1790720	I'm still in the process.
1790720	1792720	I keep thinking, yeah, I've got rid of free will,
1792720	1795720	and then discovering new depths of the sort of feeling,
1795720	1798720	feeling that it can throw up.
1798720	1799720	So I do understand that.
1799720	1805720	But interestingly, one of the people involved was Dan Wegner,
1805720	1808720	and he said, I have to live as a free will.
1808720	1810720	And I pushed him and pushed him,
1810720	1814720	and he ended up saying something like,
1814720	1817720	and it was quite heartfelt at the time,
1817720	1819720	the way he was speaking,
1819720	1823720	that he had to make a very difficult family decision
1823720	1825720	that would affect other people,
1825720	1826720	and it was very difficult.
1826720	1829720	And that in the end, he,
1829720	1831720	honestly, people can go and read this in the book
1831720	1833720	and say that I've got it wrong,
1833720	1835720	so I guess it's like a long time ago.
1835720	1839720	But my recollection is he said something along the lines of,
1839720	1841720	in the end, I let the decision make itself,
1841720	1843720	and that was a certain freedom,
1843720	1845720	and it was all fine.
1845720	1848720	And it is, in Zen terms,
1848720	1850720	it's often described as let the universe do it,
1850720	1852720	or let the practice do it.
1852720	1855720	You know, you have to find something else to blame,
1855720	1857720	and blaming the practice of meditation
1857720	1861720	is quite innocuous compared with blaming an inner self
1861720	1864720	who has magical powers to control everything.
1864720	1866720	But there are more powerful reasons, aren't there?
1866720	1869720	Dennett and Churchland give some quite important
1869720	1871720	institutional sort of society-based arguments
1871720	1874720	for why we should go ahead as if.
1874720	1875720	Yes.
1875720	1879720	To some extent, I'm with them,
1879720	1882720	because you can't all at once give up free will
1882720	1884720	and still behave well.
1884720	1886720	And this may be one of the reasons why there's always
1886720	1888720	these ethical stuff that you're supposed to do
1888720	1890720	before you get into a meditation,
1890720	1892720	which, I mean, I'm not a Buddhist,
1892720	1894720	so I'm not done all that, taking vows,
1894720	1896720	and I'm not going to do that,
1896720	1899720	but I can understand why it might be necessary.
1899720	1902720	I think our upbringing in a civilized society should...
1902720	1904720	What are they worried about?
1904720	1906720	What are they worried about? Why is it so important?
1906720	1908720	What they're worried about is the whole of the legal system
1908720	1911720	breaking down and people running amok.
1911720	1913720	There's lots of reasons why people don't run amok
1913720	1917720	and go and run over old ladies on the road,
1917720	1919720	which is one example, I remember,
1919720	1922720	from a favorite book of mine by Guy Claxton.
1922720	1924720	And we don't run amok
1924720	1927720	and run over old ladies in the road for fun,
1927720	1930720	because we are a social species,
1930720	1932720	we have reciprocal altruisms,
1932720	1935720	all sorts of biological reasons why we will,
1935720	1937720	and the whole tend to behave well,
1937720	1939720	because it will, in the end, suit us.
1939720	1941720	But the legal question is very difficult,
1941720	1944720	and in the end, I think that that,
1944720	1947720	for you mentioned Pat and Dan,
1947720	1949720	for Dan, in the end, this is the reason,
1949720	1952720	and I think it's a very, very, very, very bad reason.
1952720	1955720	What would happen to our legal systems
1955720	1957720	if... I'll just talk about England,
1957720	1961720	because I know English law better than American or other laws,
1961720	1964720	but what would happen to it
1964720	1968720	if we were to say, right, nobody has free will,
1968720	1971720	that awful 17-year-old thug
1971720	1976720	who went and beat up the other gang member or whatever
1976720	1979720	didn't do it of his own free will?
1979720	1981720	Well, why did he do it?
1981720	1983720	He did it because of his upbringing,
1983720	1985720	he did it because all his genes were this way,
1985720	1987720	all the memes he'd taken in
1987720	1989720	from all this gang warfare and everything else,
1989720	1992720	his parents were probably in some desperate strait as well
1992720	1996720	and not able to bring him up to have a clear understanding
1996720	1999720	of the consequences of his actions, any number of reasons.
1999720	2002720	Now, would then society fall apart?
2002720	2005720	No. Okay, we need to punish him, why?
2005720	2009720	Okay, let's say we think that five years in prison
2009720	2011720	would be the right punishment.
2011720	2014720	Our reasoning would not be because he's a bad person
2014720	2016720	and of his own free will did something wicked.
2016720	2019720	Our reason would be either he's so dangerous
2019720	2021720	we need to take him off the streets for a while
2021720	2023720	and try and help rehabilitate him
2023720	2027720	or it will be an incentive for him not to do it again
2027720	2030720	or it will be an incentive to other people not to do it.
2030720	2032720	Now, it seems to me that those three reasons
2032720	2036720	should be perfectly adequate for a legal system to operate on
2036720	2038720	that would be compassionate,
2038720	2041720	that would understand why people end up doing terrible things
2041720	2043720	and that would help them.
2043720	2047720	And if we legalized all drugs and half the prison population,
2047720	2050720	sorry about that aside, but that's the best way to do it,
2050720	2053720	stop putting in people in jail for taking drugs
2053720	2055720	and we had enough spaces in prisons,
2055720	2058720	the rehabilitation could be really effective.
2058720	2060720	Somebody's had a really awful life
2060720	2062720	and brought up in such a way they end up,
2062720	2064720	they can't help it, they end up in a gang,
2064720	2066720	they were in this class at school and this happened
2066720	2068720	and they got sucked into that gang,
2068720	2070720	they got made into the county lines and they were,
2070720	2072720	blah, blah, blah,
2072720	2075720	maybe we could help to give them a better life in the future.
2075720	2079720	So I think the legal system would work better
2079720	2083720	if it didn't depend on the false concept of free will.
2083720	2085720	And Dan disagrees with me
2085720	2088720	and we have argued this at great length.
2088720	2090720	Never gone to a resolution.
2090720	2092720	But Dan Danik goes further, doesn't he?
2092720	2094720	He actually believes free will is compatible
2094720	2096720	with the illusion of consciousness, doesn't he?
2096720	2099720	Yes, he does and it doesn't make any sense to me
2099720	2103720	because Dan, I think Consciousness Explained 1991
2103720	2105720	is a great book on consciousness.
2105720	2107720	I think it's still the best,
2107720	2110720	certainly one of the best books on consciousness ever.
2110720	2115720	He really goes to town on the nature of the self-illusion,
2115720	2119720	the non-existence audience in the Cartesian theatre
2119720	2122720	and the basic argument there is
2122720	2125720	even people who know neuroscience
2125720	2127720	and say they're not dualists,
2127720	2132720	they still imagine some kind of place in the brain or the mind
2132720	2136720	where it all comes together and I have the experience.
2136720	2138720	And this is what he calls the Cartesian theatre,
2138720	2141720	which doesn't exist, where I see the mental...
2141720	2144720	If I shut my eyes and imagine a green frog,
2144720	2146720	you know, it's my mental screen.
2146720	2148720	Or if I'm looking out here, you know,
2148720	2151720	I'm experiencing this in my inner theatre.
2151720	2154720	Bernie Barr's whole idea of theatre depends on this
2154720	2156720	and that's another whole argument.
2156720	2159720	So he's brilliant at showing that that is an illusion.
2159720	2161720	There isn't anybody in there.
2161720	2164720	So there isn't anybody to have free will.
2164720	2166720	You don't understand how he argues
2166720	2168720	because he's one of the best arguers on the planet.
2168720	2172720	How does he argue for a compatibilist argument?
2172720	2177720	Well, what happens there is to go back
2177720	2180720	to what I was saying at the beginning of talking about free will,
2180720	2185720	which is to me, you have to separate out the idea of this thing here
2185720	2188720	and the inner self that is an illusion.
2188720	2191720	This isn't an illusion unless everything is,
2191720	2193720	but the inner self is.
2193720	2198720	And he agrees with that distinction.
2198720	2202720	So it is extraordinary to me that having been,
2202720	2205720	as it were, the greatest persuader
2205720	2210720	that the audience in the Cartesian theatre is an illusion,
2210720	2212720	he won't then say,
2212720	2217720	ah, but free will is part of that illusion.
2217720	2222720	And the way he argues is to keep on saying
2222720	2224720	what I could have done otherwise.
2224720	2228720	And in this situation, there was a choice.
2228720	2232720	And this leads me to think that his book called Freedom Evolves
2232720	2235720	should really have been called Choice Evolves.
2235720	2238720	I would say this thing here,
2238720	2241720	not this thing inside that doesn't exist,
2241720	2244720	this thing here makes choices all the time.
2244720	2246720	And when you asked about, well,
2246720	2250720	when this is happening, what's going on?
2250720	2253720	Endless choices, the drinking of the wine,
2253720	2255720	the holding of the pen,
2255720	2257720	there's all kinds of massively parallel processes,
2257720	2259720	which he talks about in Conscience Explained.
2259720	2263720	They are responsible for what actions come out of this mouth
2263720	2265720	and these hands.
2265720	2268720	It just goes to show how compelling,
2268720	2270720	if even Dan Dennett,
2270720	2276720	the master of arguing us out of our illusion of consciousness,
2276720	2278720	can't accept this.
2278720	2283720	His experience is just too powerful for him to have a look at this.
2283720	2287720	It's not that, I don't think it's that,
2287720	2289720	because I think his experience is fine,
2289720	2292720	except that he won't take on the job of giving up free will.
2292720	2296720	But I think it's, he keeps conflating,
2296720	2299720	even though he knows there's a separation and difference
2299720	2302720	between the illusory inner self and the whole self,
2302720	2304720	he keeps conflating them and saying,
2304720	2308720	well, these choices are made by this person
2308720	2310720	and that counts as free will.
2310720	2312720	And that's where he and I differ.
2312720	2314720	He says the free will belongs to the whole person
2314720	2315720	and I say, no, it doesn't.
2315720	2319720	The free will is always people attributed to the enemy.
2319720	2322720	That's where I think we fall apart,
2322720	2325720	because I can't persuade him that if you really accept
2325720	2328720	the non-existent audience in the Cartesian theatre
2328720	2331720	as the one that's supposed to have the free will,
2331720	2333720	if you say this has the free will,
2333720	2336720	then you're going to say what he says,
2336720	2338720	which is, well, it went into the restaurant
2338720	2341720	and it could have chosen the spaghetti instead of the,
2341720	2344720	well, that's John Searle who uses that example,
2344720	2348720	but it's a choice, I say we are choice machines.
2348720	2350720	We're endlessly making choices all the time.
2350720	2352720	And in the end, I think he's terrified
2352720	2354720	that the society will fall apart.
2354720	2356720	And I've explained why I don't think it will.
2356720	2358720	Sam Harris explains why he doesn't think it will.
2358720	2360720	Lots of other people have explained why it might not.
2360720	2362720	It would be a big upheaval to change our legal systems,
2362720	2365720	but we'll have to, because they're getting ridiculous.
2365720	2367720	If you think of things like people say,
2367720	2369720	oh, well, I didn't mean to do something or other.
2369720	2374720	My prefrontal cortex made me do it.
2374720	2377720	You're still inventing this self who would be responsible
2377720	2380720	if their brain hadn't done something.
2380720	2382720	The more neuroscience we learn,
2382720	2385720	the more we're going to have to change our attitude
2385720	2387720	towards law and punishment and so on.
2387720	2389720	And it'll have to happen, it'll be difficult,
2389720	2391720	but it will have to happen.
2391720	2394720	But Dan thinks, I think he's...
2394720	2396720	I shouldn't really speak for him,
2396720	2398720	but I've had a lot of conversations with him.
2398720	2402720	A six-month back-and-forward email discussion last year.
2402720	2405720	But also, he's been here to my house several times,
2405720	2407720	and we've sat over the breakfast and argued about this.
2407720	2410720	And in the end, I think he comes down to...
2410720	2415720	He's too afraid of the consequences of people believing it's an illusion.
2415720	2419720	Now, to some extent, there is reason to be cautious about that.
2419720	2422720	Difficult, but I would rather have the truth,
2422720	2424720	which is that it's illusion,
2424720	2428720	than pretend because I'm too scared of what the consequences will be.
2428720	2430720	And your version,
2430720	2433720	which we also touched on in episode one, Listers,
2433720	2437720	is a version based on compassion and collective responsibility,
2437720	2441720	which I think has to be the way we go in the future,
2441720	2443720	regardless of the status of free will anyway.
2443720	2447720	And hopefully, we could be right in saying
2447720	2449720	that that's the way culture is going.
2449720	2455720	I do hope that taking that positive line is, in fact, true.
2455720	2462720	Now, you are by no means the only one arguing that free will is an illusion.
2462720	2466720	For example, you've just mentioned the philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris,
2466720	2472720	and he has long held much to the chagra of everybody around him,
2472720	2476720	and he was very, very brave in holding this for a very long time,
2476720	2481720	that we'd be much, much less frustrated if we realized we didn't have free will.
2481720	2486720	And I don't think it's a coincidence that both of you are long-term meditators.
2486720	2493720	So in your opinion, what is it about the sort of mindfulness meditation approach
2493720	2499720	that helps us to associate less with this feeling that it's ourselves
2499720	2504720	following the trail of thought, the reasoning, and the decision-making?
2504720	2510720	What is it about meditation that makes you sort of less attached to that notion?
2510720	2512720	It's a long, slow road.
2512720	2518720	As I mentioned earlier, I've been meditating for more than 40 years
2518720	2523720	every day for 35 years and going on the streets.
2523720	2529720	And it's slow, but it does seem to be the most extraordinary unfolding process
2529720	2532720	that heads in this kind of direction.
2532720	2538720	So in terms of more straightforward mindfulness meditation,
2538720	2544720	because most of my practice has been in Zen, and that's a more specific kind of way,
2544720	2550720	but for any kind of meditation, letting go is one of the big difficulties,
2550720	2552720	and you have to let go of so much.
2552720	2556720	And a ghastly thought comes and keeps on coming, keeps on coming.
2556720	2558720	Let it go doesn't mean push it away.
2558720	2562720	Let it go in meditation means...
2562720	2566720	Well, my original Zen teacher, Long Ben now, John Crook,
2566720	2570720	always used to say, let it come, let it be, let it go.
2570720	2574720	And what he meant by that was don't block things from coming.
2574720	2577720	When you feel them coming, that awful thought again, I don't want to think about it.
2577720	2580720	Don't block it, let it come, let it be.
2580720	2583720	In other words, don't do anything with it, don't hang on to it, cling to it,
2583720	2587720	make something out of it, elaborate it, blah, blah, blah, just let it, whatever.
2587720	2589720	And when it starts to fade away, don't hang on to it,
2589720	2591720	because, well, that's that terrible thought.
2591720	2594720	Even a terrible one you can hang on to, or a really nice one, of course,
2594720	2597720	it's easier if you want to hang on to it, or like that, let it go.
2597720	2602720	So you become, from that very, very simple basic training,
2602720	2608720	sitting there hour after hour after hour with the dredges of your mind coming along,
2608720	2615720	that process of letting go is a fundamental part of most meditation parts.
2615720	2620720	And so when it comes to observing the mind, you see all these thoughts coming up,
2620720	2625720	but you also begin to observe impulses to do things,
2625720	2632720	and you can let them go, or ideas about the control that you have,
2632720	2635720	and you can observe them popping up.
2635720	2639720	And you can, I mean, one of the things that I only realized recently,
2639720	2644720	and this is quite a revelation, I mean, I'm saying that in the sense that,
2644720	2647720	you get these revelations in meditation, and they seem like, you know,
2647720	2650720	but I don't want to make it that bigger than it is,
2650720	2654720	but it was just something that really surprised me that I should have known already,
2654720	2658720	and I think that's very often the case when you get something and you go,
2658720	2663720	oh, wow, yeah, but why didn't I realize that before?
2663720	2668720	What I have found recently is,
2668720	2674720	I suppose as the mind slows down in deep practice and continuous practice,
2674720	2679720	it's easier and easier to see thoughts popping up and actions and so on.
2679720	2684720	And I've begun to observe much more clearly than I had before,
2684720	2689720	the process of attributing a thought to me.
2689720	2693720	So very often I'll now observe that my thinking is,
2693720	2695720	oh, I want to go and do something or other,
2695720	2700720	and I will just realize that that's come up and just let it go
2700720	2705720	in the context of, oh, the universe has thrown that up, this brain has thrown that up.
2705720	2707720	That's what's happening.
2707720	2713720	So instead of me thinking, I want a cup of tea, I'm going in the kitchen to get it,
2713720	2718720	the thought, if there's a thought at all, will be that's what's happening.
2718720	2721720	She's going into the kitchen to get the cup of tea.
2721720	2726720	So it's allowing the stuff to happen without the attribution.
2726720	2731720	And then you begin to see, like Wagner said, I mean, go straight back to Wagner's theory,
2731720	2737720	that it's about this false attribution, that it was my thought that caused it.
2737720	2743720	So then this particular little practice that I've found myself doing recently
2743720	2748720	is simply that, simply seeing the attribution happening and going,
2748720	2750720	oh, there's the attribution happening again.
2750720	2756720	And it all can be attributed to body, brain, and world.
2756720	2759720	It's all just happening.
2759720	2761720	That's bloody terrifying.
2761720	2764720	I mean, it's just happening.
2764720	2767720	And I can't see where it's going to go, what's going to happen.
2767720	2773720	But the reassuring thing is this person has been brought up in a sensible way,
2773720	2777720	can read and write and think straight and is reasonably moral,
2777720	2781720	tries to be good and kind and compassionate and let it happen.
2781720	2784720	And that's a matter of confidence and letting it happen.
2784720	2788720	And years and years and years of meditation can help with that.
2788720	2794720	That actually you are OK and reasonably nice person.
2794720	2797720	And you do bad things, everybody does.
2797720	2800720	But it's fine to let it happen.
2800720	2805720	And actually it's better to allow it to be the universe doing it
2805720	2808720	than to be constantly thinking about myself.
2808720	2809720	What shall I do now?
2809720	2810720	What am I?
2810720	2811720	Did I do the right thing?
2811720	2812720	All of that.
2812720	2814720	Sorry, I've gone round the clock.
2814720	2818720	No, it was beautifully and it's clearly very, very personal
2818720	2822720	when you're talking about it from inside so many years of meditation.
2822720	2823720	It's very, very personal.
2823720	2826720	I get the same when I listen to Sam talking about this.
2826720	2829720	Do you guys differ on the free will position?
2829720	2833720	Or have you pretty much come to the same conclusion?
2833720	2835720	I don't know Sam very well.
2835720	2836720	I've only met him.
2836720	2839720	I think I've only met him once.
2839720	2842720	And we've not had big arguments.
2842720	2844720	We've corresponded.
2844720	2845720	I've read his books.
2845720	2847720	I would say we're pretty close.
2847720	2848720	Yes.
2848720	2851720	I mean, his way of putting things over is very different from mine.
2851720	2855720	His attitude to religion is perhaps slightly.
2855720	2858720	No, I think basically, as far as free will is concerned,
2858720	2860720	I would say we basically would say the same.
2860720	2865720	And would you say he extrapolated because he started very much in meditation
2865720	2867720	before he came to philosophy and neuroscience?
2867720	2872720	Do you find that there's elements of the meditator mind
2872720	2874720	in the way he's arguing these things?
2874720	2875720	Oh, yeah.
2875720	2876720	Absolutely.
2876720	2877720	Totally.
2877720	2879720	Well, his books are full of it, aren't they?
2879720	2884720	Am I right in saying that the key here is identifying with the self
2884720	2887720	as the source of those ideas?
2887720	2889720	Saying that's me talking.
2889720	2890720	That's me reasoning.
2890720	2891720	That's me choosing.
2891720	2896720	Is that the key to this sense of free will,
2896720	2899720	this association with that train of thought?
2899720	2901720	Yeah, exactly.
2901720	2903720	And that's really what Wagner was on about.
2903720	2907720	I mean, he kept it simpler than that, but that is precisely it.
2907720	2908720	Yes.
2908720	2914720	Every time we make an attribution to our self of a thought or a decision
2914720	2919720	or an action or whatever, we are giving strength to the illusory self.
2919720	2921720	And we're doing it all the time.
2921720	2928720	And dismantling that is tricky, but worth doing, I would say.
2928720	2934720	I mean, the people I know, and there are not very many who have let go
2934720	2940720	of the illusion of free will are not, they're great, lovely people.
2940720	2941720	They're not inhuman.
2941720	2943720	They're not really weird because they do not free will.
2943720	2947720	You wouldn't really know until you've got to know them.
2947720	2951720	I'm only saying that because I'm kind of wanting to reassure people that it's OK.
2951720	2953720	It's tricky.
2953720	2961720	And you do have to have a sense that your intentions are good.
2961720	2966720	But once it gets going, it's a kind of self, self-propelling process,
2966720	2968720	I think, the letting go.
2968720	2972720	Now, so I need to ask you about the Zen take on free will,
2972720	2974720	not least because some of my listeners have been asking,
2974720	2978720	saying, oh, can we get Sue back to talk more about Zen?
2978720	2980720	What's the Zen Buddhist perspective on this?
2980720	2984720	Which, I mean, I imagine you explored it a little bit in your 2011 book,
2984720	2986720	Zen and the Art of Consciousness.
2986720	2989720	What does Buddhism have to say about free will?
2990720	2992720	Nothing.
2992720	2997720	The simple answer is that because I can only say that because a good friend of mine,
2997720	3001720	Stephen Batchelay, he wrote some of the viewers will know his books,
3001720	3006720	Buddhism Without Belief and his other wonderful books.
3006720	3011720	He knows the various languages of Sanskrit and Pali and so on
3011720	3015720	and says that is no word for free will in those languages
3015720	3018720	in which the original suitors were written down.
3018720	3020720	So that's why I say nothing.
3020720	3022720	That's quite interesting, isn't it?
3022720	3023720	Not even a word.
3023720	3025720	It is very, very interesting.
3025720	3026720	Yeah, absolutely it is.
3026720	3031720	So in other words, their way of constructing things was rather different.
3031720	3037720	Nevertheless, there is the fundamental concept of dependent origination
3037720	3042720	or dependent arising within all forms of Buddhism, I think,
3042720	3044720	but I'm not a Buddhist scholar.
3044720	3045720	I must absolutely say that.
3045720	3048720	And almost all my practice has been in Zen,
3048720	3052720	although I've also done training in Mahamudra and in Janas practice
3052720	3054720	and various other things.
3054720	3057720	But even when it comes to Zen,
3057720	3059720	I know more about practice than I do about theory.
3059720	3063720	So don't take what I'm saying as kind of, you know,
3063720	3065720	a Buddhist scholar saying something they really know about.
3065720	3067720	Sue, do you mind if I just jump in there?
3067720	3070720	Because this is literally what I was about to ask you about.
3070720	3072720	As you've brought it up,
3072720	3076720	I wanted to ask you about this idea of dependent origination,
3076720	3081720	which was the Buddha's second great realisation alongside the first,
3081720	3084720	which is suffering, comes from attachment.
3084720	3088720	And the origin of this word dependent origination
3088720	3091720	is that a thing's origin depends on other things,
3091720	3095720	which depend on other things and so on in an infinite regress
3095720	3097720	rather than having any identity in itself.
3098720	3101720	So nothing has identity in and of itself,
3101720	3105720	but only interdependent in relation to other things.
3105720	3110720	Now, I had a very interesting mystical experience in my 20s,
3110720	3112720	which for any listeners interested,
3112720	3115720	I do discuss this with David Luke in our episode
3115720	3117720	on exceptional human experiences.
3117720	3121720	So do go and have a look at that if you're interested in peak experiences.
3121720	3124720	But essentially this experience showed me
3124720	3127720	that everything was dependently originated
3127720	3131720	and it was only years later when I was studying Buddhism at university
3131720	3133720	that I found this idea
3133720	3136720	and I learned that it was central to the Buddhist worldview.
3136720	3139720	So given the contents of your mystical experience,
3139720	3141720	which we touched on in episode one,
3141720	3145720	your extraordinary experience of becoming one with the universe
3145720	3148720	as you couldn't get the right size coming back into your body
3148720	3151720	and you end up expanding until you were one with the universe,
3151720	3154720	given that extraordinary experience
3154720	3156720	and the reports of so many others
3156720	3160720	and the new research into the relativity of space and time,
3160720	3164720	do you think that this understanding of an inseparable monism
3164720	3168720	could go some way to explain how we can be seemingly separate
3168720	3173720	and yet fundamentally inseparable from the rest of space and time?
3173720	3176720	Oh, I don't know, but I will say this.
3176720	3179720	I think what the Buddha saw and you saw, I didn't.
3179720	3181720	I mean, mine was a different kind of experience
3181720	3183720	and amazingly dramatic and very helpful
3183720	3187720	because I think all my life in a way has been...
3187720	3192720	I was shown that, I was just given this amazing experience
3192720	3196720	and in a way all my life has been trying to understand that in some way,
3196720	3200720	whether that's meditation or neuroscience or whatever in my life.
3200720	3202720	And that's been great.
3202720	3208720	But I think what the Buddha saw there and that you saw
3208720	3213720	is absolute fundamental principle that underlies modern science
3213720	3216720	and that he was, if you like, in a way the first scientist,
3216720	3218720	the first one to think actually clearly
3218720	3220720	because all cultures...
3220720	3224720	Well, generally speaking, cultures through all the ages,
3224720	3227720	the natural way that people think about themselves
3227720	3230720	is from early in childhood, we know now,
3230720	3233720	is to think of themselves in dualist terms,
3233720	3237720	that there's me inside and I do things and control things.
3237720	3241720	And then, you know, many, many cultures have ideas of spirits
3241720	3244720	and life after death and spirits that do things
3244720	3247720	and that the rain is there because of a spirit and whatever.
3247720	3250720	And he was basically just cutting through all of that
3250720	3255720	and saying, no, there is no separate self at all.
3255720	3258720	It's not what you think it is.
3258720	3264720	And everything that happens happens from what was before.
3264720	3270720	And it's not so much in my understanding that there's chains of causation.
3270720	3273720	It's more about conditions. They talk about causes and conditions.
3273720	3275720	Sir, cause of causation, maybe.
3275720	3277720	Hang on, let's not get to that for a minute.
3277720	3280720	But the basic idea of the conditions,
3280720	3284720	out of these conditions arise this and out of these conditions arise this
3284720	3287720	and the entire universe then you can see is everything is interdependent
3287720	3290720	and everything arises because of everything else.
3290720	3294720	That is the way, if I'm thinking about not having free will,
3294720	3296720	that is the way that I'm thinking.
3296720	3299720	Everything is arising as it must because that's the only way it can
3299720	3302720	and that's what it's doing and there isn't any, I couldn't have done otherwise.
3302720	3304720	That's just what happens.
3304720	3308720	So then you said about the circle of, yeah,
3308720	3314720	well, what's happened as far as I can see in the millennia of Buddhism
3314720	3318720	is that what started out as a fairly straightforward idea
3318720	3324720	with five links, I think, of things giving rise to things giving rise to things
3324720	3329720	became elaborated, people do love this, they do now.
3329720	3335720	There's a 12 link thing and recently I've become interested in dependent origination
3335720	3339720	but I've always thought, what a load of crap, this gives rise to this
3339720	3341720	and this gives rise to this and it goes round to the 12 of them.
3341720	3343720	Why should there be 12?
3343720	3348720	I just think, sorry, this is me being childish if you like
3348720	3350720	but I've never wanted to know about that.
3350720	3354720	I just think it's so much stuff, for example, in the Abhidharma and elsewhere
3354720	3358720	which you can just look at it and think that's just people making stuff up,
3358720	3360720	trying to make sense out of it.
3360720	3364720	So I ignore all that stuff and that's why I keep saying I'm not a Buddhist scholar,
3364720	3367720	I don't know all that stuff and I'm probably missing out on the most fantastic things
3367720	3371720	but I'm much more interested in just getting on with seeing clearly
3371720	3374720	and meditating in order to do so and being mindful.
3374720	3380720	I didn't go into the details of all of the what I would call basically theological,
3380720	3384720	obviously it's the Buddhist version but all of those Buddhist scholars who went on
3384720	3390720	shortly after the Buddha died, it immediately became a massive argument
3390720	3393720	and everybody was going into the cosmologies based on these ideas
3393720	3396720	but I think the Buddha literally just saw it and that was it.
3397720	3401720	Absolutely right and he said when people asked him questions about
3401720	3404720	does the universe last forever or does it stop or those kind of questions
3404720	3406720	he said I'm not going to answer them.
3406720	3407720	I don't know.
3407720	3410720	Yeah, exactly and now he might, I don't know if he were like,
3410720	3415720	well there probably are enlightened people around now who might look at the physics
3415720	3418720	and go yeah that makes sense or doesn't or whatever
3418720	3422720	but he was very sensibly saying this is how I see it
3422720	3428720	and it's actually easy to see if you look in the right way at anything.
3428720	3430720	You can just see.
3430720	3433720	I think it's not easy.
3433720	3443720	That's wrong but let's suppose you can simplify your response to the world.
3443720	3446720	I suppose I've shut my eyes because that immediately makes it simpler
3446720	3449720	but it's possible with the eyes open as well
3449720	3455720	and simply experience what's happening without words,
3455720	3459720	without conceptualization, without making objects or things.
3459720	3461720	It's amazingly hard to do.
3461720	3466720	I shouldn't have implied that it's at all easy but in principle straightforward.
3466720	3470720	What you find is it's pretty gappy.
3470720	3475720	There's just little bits and pieces and noise here or whatever.
3475720	3477720	We immediately make space.
3477720	3481720	I think we can't avoid that although I think it may be possible
3481720	3485720	but whatever the sound is is over there
3485720	3489720	and this bottom sitting on this stool is here.
3489720	3492720	Our whole brain is set up to do spatial awareness
3492720	3496720	but even if you're still doing that,
3496720	3499720	that noise doesn't have to be the fire crackling over there.
3499720	3503720	What your brain is doing for obvious reasons for you to live in the world
3503720	3505720	and get on with stuff is that's the fire.
3505720	3510720	Was that a car outside or is that my husband coming and saying it's summertime
3510720	3516720	or whatever but it's possible simply to sit there
3516720	3521720	and there's just kind of sights and sounds and they have no meaning at all
3521720	3524720	once all the words and conceptualizations have gone away.
3524720	3529720	Then it's pretty obvious that it all just happens because it has to happen
3529720	3531720	and it's not objects.
3531720	3535720	The objects, this laptop in front of me, this pen,
3535720	3540720	I need to be able to say that's a pen and I need to be able to write with it
3540720	3543720	so that's the way my brain is working.
3543720	3547720	The reason I mentioned this idea of an inseparable monism,
3547720	3549720	listeners in our first episode,
3549720	3554720	we discussed briefly the different positions on potential theories of consciousness
3554720	3559720	and Sue said that she really wanted to try and find a monist solution.
3559720	3561720	You know, dualism really is problematic.
3561720	3566720	You've got the whole combination problem and it just really isn't where you want to end up.
3566720	3570720	The reason I mentioned dependent origination is because for me personally,
3570720	3573720	sitting inside that experience of it,
3573720	3580720	I really felt that it was possible to have a scientific explanation
3580720	3584720	for how some things could appear to give rise to others
3584720	3588720	but within a network rather than a linear line,
3588720	3591720	within a network of interconnected causation.
3591720	3594720	That basically talks about a monism.
3594720	3599720	So you've got separateness within a monism and that doesn't cause any problems
3599720	3602720	and the only reason I find this so exciting now
3602720	3605720	is that physics seem to be heading this direction.
3605720	3609720	The implications of Einstein which we're going to be getting into on the show listeners
3609720	3612720	really are still a bit like a free will question.
3612720	3613720	They're terrifying.
3613720	3617720	You know, you're like, oh my god, what do you mean that time isn't real
3617720	3621720	and one of the most amazing implications of dependent origination
3621720	3627720	is not only that all things in space are interconnected in causation
3627720	3628720	but also all moments in time.
3628720	3630720	That's from the beginning to the end.
3630720	3635720	So the very first moment in time is as dependent on the last moment in time as everything else
3635720	3640720	but Einstein's theory may well explain to us that time and space are an illusion anyway.
3640720	3647720	So with that in mind, I'm finally finding some peace with this idea of a two-tiered reality
3647720	3651720	where we have separateness and we have oneness.
3651720	3657720	And I think dependent origination for me personally with that experience was the sort of bridge.
3657720	3661720	Have you had anything similar to anything that kind of made you feel
3661720	3665720	that there was a connection between separateness and oneness?
3666720	3671720	Yes, but in the end, I don't get it.
3671720	3680720	I still don't get how there can be experience and what underlies it all
3680720	3685720	because it seems absolutely obvious that there is only experience.
3685720	3686720	There's nothing else.
3686720	3691720	I mean, I can't, you know, even a physicist with instruments, you know,
3691720	3694720	reading the things and so on.
3694720	3696720	It's all based on that.
3696720	3699720	So why do we agree that there's a world out there?
3699720	3702720	What is the fundamental underlying nature?
3702720	3711720	I come then back to form and emptiness, that form, everything that we experience comes out of nothing.
3711720	3716720	And that nothingness can be directly experienced as nothingness.
3716720	3718720	There's nothing to say about it.
3718720	3720720	But how does that work?
3721720	3728720	And why do you fall on the side of nothingness rather than everythingness?
3728720	3733720	I'm just saying that that's the Buddhist concept of form and emptiness.
3733720	3735720	Actually, they're the same in the end.
3735720	3739720	I mean, in the heart sutra, you know, form is emptiness and emptiness is form.
3739720	3742720	Form is precisely emptiness and emptiness is precisely form.
3742720	3746720	So also our sensation, perception, religion and consciousness.
3747720	3752720	So that much seems clear.
3752720	3759720	And then because then you find that in this moment, well, you know, if you really get into it,
3759720	3761720	you can never find a moment.
3761720	3769720	But if I allow there to be one inexperience, where does that come from?
3771720	3772720	Out of nowhere.
3773720	3777720	No, I'm I like mystery.
3777720	3785720	I don't know whether if you if you noticed it, I mean, if you've seen my big consciousness textbook,
3785720	3790720	it begins with perplexity, you know, get perplexed about this.
3790720	3791720	It really is bad.
3791720	3794720	And if you think it's bad, it's probably even worse than you think it is.
3794720	3799720	And at the end, it ends with a little cartoon of someone saying, but what is it?
3800720	3805720	And it ends with perplexity, because I don't think I mean, I'm not saying that you're wrong.
3805720	3811720	I even agree with you that those really interesting ways that physics is going doesn't solve the mystery to me.
3811720	3813720	I'm still bewildered.
3813720	3814720	Yeah.
3814720	3817720	That bewilderment pushes you on to try and keep going.
3817720	3821720	And I'm trying and keeping going and wondering and being complex.
3821720	3827720	And Sue, something you said in the first episode has come up really quite often about this.
3828720	3833720	This ability to study consciousness from from this desire not to get into isms,
3833720	3839720	because as soon as we associate with a mental construct, we are constricted by human thought,
3839720	3849720	which unfortunately isn't capable, even at its highest level of understanding anything so complete from our one sided perspective.
3849720	3854720	So I think when it made me laugh when you said, I don't get it because it's almost like,
3854720	3858720	hang on, haven't you been saying there's nothing to get?
3858720	3865720	Oh, well, if you end up with me looking like utterly confused, that's fine by me.
3865720	3869720	It means we've had a good old chew of the chew of the gristle.
3869720	3872720	If we if we get to that, I don't get it moment.
3872720	3873720	Yeah.
3873720	3874720	Yeah.
3874720	3878720	Well, I expect we'll have another one in due course, at least sorry, I should perhaps not invite myself,
3878720	3880720	but it is fun talking to you.
3880720	3883720	Well, it's very kind of you to be so enthusiastic.
3883720	3889720	So I wanted to thank you for taking a punt on the podcast before we were even existent and just saying,
3889720	3890720	yeah, let's go for it.
3890720	3892720	It was really, really sweet of you.
3892720	3899720	And I'm very, very touched to set to for you to say that it's exciting to talk to me because I'm such an amateur.
3899720	3907720	And it just feels wonderful to have one's thoughts and perspectives and ideas validated by such a seasoned professional.
3907720	3912720	And I have to say, Sue, I am going to ask you back for season three,
3912720	3920720	because we still haven't had the chance to talk about possibly one of the most important things of your work,
3920720	3925720	which is memetics, which you tackled in your 2010 book, The Meme Machine.
3925720	3929720	So I really hope you mind coming back.
3929720	3931720	1999.
3931720	3932720	Oh, right.
3932720	3933720	Okay.
3933720	3934720	Right.
3934720	3935720	Sorry, I've got that wrong.
3935720	3936720	Of course, it's 1999.
3936720	3939720	It's been a long time since you wrote that, hasn't it?
3939720	3941720	Yeah, I'm getting back into that stuff now.
3941720	3943720	So I'll happily talk about it.
3943720	3950720	It's so relevant now with all of the information ecology that's going on and all of this wonderful,
3950720	3952720	the media going independent.
3952720	3955720	I mean, obviously there are lots and lots of challenges.
3955720	3960720	And I think your work really is a useful kind of,
3960720	3966720	it's almost like a tool, a sort of like, don't forget this while you're navigating all of this information.
3966720	3973720	So I really want you to come back and talk about this, the way we pick up these memes that seem to confirm our biases.
3973720	3979720	And then we retransmit them out into the world, sometimes completely unconsciously.
3979720	3986720	I really wouldn't ask if I didn't think it was more relevant than ever to myself and to the listeners to get aware of that.
3986720	3990720	I'm sure that the researchers come a long way since you, since you wrote that book.
3990720	3994720	So Sue, it leaves me only to say thank you so much.
3994720	4006720	Just back from a retreat coming on the show to explain this really, really, really difficult argument, ancient argument to the listeners
4006720	4010720	and helping us really put ourselves on the spot and say,
4010720	4015720	do we want to really live with this one or are we going to do what so many do and just say,
4015720	4018720	well, let's just let's do it as if we had free will.
4018720	4022720	I really don't know where I stand. I don't get it either. I've got no idea.
4022720	4025720	I'm just going to say, I think it's great.
4025720	4029720	So you've really helped me to just be like, I don't know.
4029720	4030720	And it doesn't matter.
4030720	4039720	And I think for somebody like yourself who's been pursuing those big questions from the start, it's actually a great relief
4039720	4050720	because the kind of tormented philosopher really is just so pointless when you realise how much of this is just pure hot air.
4050720	4053720	You're suffering unnecessarily. Would you agree?
4053720	4055720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4055720	4059720	But maybe you have to go through that to come to something else.
4059720	4061720	Right. Till next time.
4061720	4063720	Thank you so much, Sue. See you next time.
4063720	4064720	Bye.
4069720	4072720	you
