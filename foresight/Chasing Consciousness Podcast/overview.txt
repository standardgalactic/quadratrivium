Checking Chasing Consciousness Podcast/EXAMINING FREE WILL - Susan Blackmore PHD #30.txt
 In this episode, Sue Blackmore discusses the concept of free will and the complexities surrounding it with a host who acknowledges the bewilderment that comes with exploring such profound topics. Blackmore emphasizes that attempting to study consciousness without being constrained by human thought is challenging due to our limited perspective. She humorously notes that if they reach a point where she says, "I don't get it," it indicates a deep engagement with the subject matter.

The host expresses gratitude for Sue's willingness to participate in the podcast before its official launch and appreciates her expert insights as a seasoned professional. They look forward to Sue returning for season three of the podcast to delve deeper into her work on memetics, particularly in light of current information ecology and media dynamics.

Blackmore's book "The Meme Machine," first published in 1999, is highlighted as highly relevant, offering a tool for understanding how memes can shape our beliefs and behaviors, often unconsciously. The host suggests that since the publication of her work, research in this field has advanced significantly.

Throughout the conversation, Sue Blackmore acknowledges the journey of grappling with these complex questions, suggesting that the torment of the philosopher might be unnecessary but possibly a necessary step towards reaching a different understanding. The host and Sue Blackmore agree that realizing the futility of needless suffering can be a significant relief in the pursuit of answering life's big questions.

The episode concludes with the host thanking Sue for her insights and the listener for joining them in this exploration, signaling a willingness to embrace uncertainty and the complexity of consciousness without the constraints of rigid mental constructs.
