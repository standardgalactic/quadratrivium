Processing Overview for GOTO Conferences
============================
Checking GOTO Conferences/Fun with the Lambda Calculus • Corey Haines • GOTO 2015.txt
1. **Understanding Zero and Successor**: In the context of Peano arithmetic, zero is a special value that has no predecessor, and the successor function takes a number and returns its next natural number. The successor of zero is one, and the successor of one is two, and so on.

2. **Implementing Zero and Successor**: In Ruby, we can implement these concepts by defining `zero` as a pair of `false` and an arbitrary value (since `nil` cannot be used as a hash key), and `successor` as a method that takes a natural number and returns its successor as a pair of `true` and the incremented value.

3. **Predecessor Function**: We also define a `predecessor` function that takes a natural number and returns the natural number one less than the input, effectively going back one step in the sequence.

4. **Proving Infinity of Natural Numbers**: By using these functions, we can demonstrate the concept of an infinite set of natural numbers by showing that for any natural number `n`, there is always a next natural number which is its successor.

5. **Building Two Natural Numbers**: The speaker demonstrates how to create two different natural numbers and convert them to Ruby numerals, which allows us to interact with these numbers in a more familiar way.

6. **Counting Down**: A `times` function is written that counts down from a given natural number by repeatedly calling the predecessor function until it reaches zero.

7. **Practical Application**: The speaker shows how to use these concepts to count down from ten, demonstrating the practical application of these arithmetic principles in code.

8. **Final Note**: The speaker encourages the audience to write their own `add` function to experience the performance difference between adding small numbers and larger numbers, highlighting the hands-on learning experience.

9. **Call to Action**: The speaker suggests buying their book for further learning and concludes the talk with a light-hearted mention of their affection for pistachios.

The presentation is an engaging example of how abstract mathematical concepts can be implemented and played with in a programming language like Ruby, making complex ideas more accessible and fun to understand through coding.
