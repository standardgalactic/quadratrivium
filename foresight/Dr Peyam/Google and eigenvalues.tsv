0	5760	Thanks for watching and let me show you the math behind Google, at least the way it used to work
5760	14880	back in the 90s. Because when I was younger and we had other search websites like Yahoo or Excite,
14880	21120	it was quite a nightmare. Because if you were trying to look for a website about apples,
21120	27200	the one that would get the most hits was one where it just said apples, apples, apples, apples,
27200	34880	apples, apples, which was not very useful. But then came Google and life was much easier because
34880	42160	they use what's called the page rank model, which looks as follows. Because suppose you have four
42160	49840	websites which are connected as follows. So from three, you can go to one, from one, you can go to
49840	57360	two, three, and four. Then the way Google works is that it assigns what's called an importance vector.
58320	74400	Let's call it V. And suppose V is, for instance, 0.2, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.3. Then what that means is that
74400	81280	the highest number is better. So website three is more important than website four,
81280	86000	which is more important than website one, which is more important than website two.
86640	94960	So three would get suggested first and then four and then one and two. Now, how do we determine
94960	101360	that importance vector? Well, with just a little bit of linear algebra and probability.
105120	116800	Because what we need is some initial vector. So assume all four websites are treated equally.
116800	126960	So assume our initial vector is just 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.25.
126960	139200	And some way of transitioning from the initial vector to the next step. And for this, we need
139200	146240	something called a transition matrix. And in order to find a transition matrix, we need some
146240	154480	probabilities. And you'll see why. In particular, think of it as follows. Suppose you start with
154480	162880	website one. What are the chances of going to website two? Well, there's three possibilities,
162880	170240	two, four, or three. And so in particular, from one to two, there's a third chance
170240	178960	of landing to website two. So one third, one third, one third. And well, then we can just
178960	186480	complete the other arrows as follows. So it's a nice exercise to show that the other probabilities
186480	195200	are as follows. And this allows us to calculate our transition matrix. And the way you read the
195200	204160	transition matrix is from top to left. And so this is website one, two, three, four, one, two,
204160	211280	three, four. And you have to ask yourselves, well, to go from website one back to website one,
211920	218880	where there's no self-linkage here. So the probability is zero. To go from two to one,
219440	226240	again, two does not connect to one. The probability is zero. To go from three to one,
227120	233280	well, there's just one connection here. So the probability is one. And let's say to go from
233360	242000	four to one, the probability is one-half. And well, then you can do the same spiel with websites
242000	249440	two, three, and four. And you end up getting the following matrix. Ta-da! Magic, isn't it?
250560	256400	Now, what are we trying to answer, by the way? We want to figure out in the end,
256400	264080	which website is the most important one. And in order to simplify, we just want to ask ourselves,
264080	271920	what happens if we let this run infinitely many times? So what happens after infinitely many clicks?
272480	278480	And well, in order to do this, we first need to figure out what happens after one click.
279360	287760	Well, if you think about this, in order to go from the initial vector to what happens next,
287760	297680	you just have to apply a once. So v1 is av0. And well, to figure out what happens
298480	307200	after two clicks, so to figure out v2, that's just what happens when you apply a to the first step.
308160	318800	So av1. But remember, v1 itself is transitioned, so it's just av0. And that becomes a squared v0.
320400	328000	How cool is that? Using a squared, you can directly go from nothing to the second step.
328000	336720	It's like a teleportation. And in particular, to go directly from the initial step to the
336720	346160	end step, you just have to calculate a to the n. So a to the n v0. And of course,
346160	354880	nothing prevents us from plugging in infinity here. So in particular, the answer to our question,
354880	366080	v infinity, it's a infinity times v0. And so really, all we just need to answer is the question,
366080	375760	what is a infinity? And this is where linear algebra can help us. And so the next step is to
375760	384800	use some linear algebra where we diagonalize a. So it turns out a is pdp inverse. And if you do the
384800	395840	calculation or use Wolfram Alpha, you get d is a diagonal matrix with one entry is one. And that
395840	404160	one's super important. The other one are very small. So let's call them epsilon, delta, I don't
404160	415120	know why not xi. And for p, we have the following. So again, only the first eigenvector matters.
415120	423360	You'll see why. And I think we get two, two thirds, three halves. And I believe one.
425520	434000	And the rest we don't really care. And why is this important? Because this decomposition
434000	443920	allows us to calculate any power of a quite easily. Because for instance, a squared, that is a a,
444800	454960	which is pdp inverse, pdp inverse, and p inverse and p cancels out. And you get pd squared p inverse.
455920	464800	So a squared is pd squared p inverse. And in general, a to the n is pd to the n p inverse.
465680	473520	But as we'll see soon, d to the n is very easy to calculate, which allows us to calculate a to the
473520	483600	n in a much easier way. And nothing prevents us from letting n go to infinity. So in fact,
483600	495040	the stuff that we want, v infinity, it's a infinity v naught, which just becomes pd infinity p naught,
495120	512000	or p inverse of v naught, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25. But what is d to the infinity? Remember, those
512000	519760	eigenvalues are very small. So if you raise them to infinity, you get zero. So in the end,
519760	533120	we get 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So this huge mess that seems very hard to calculate
533120	540960	actually becomes quite easy. And if you actually do the calculation, which I'll skip because there's
541040	549120	a nicer way very soon, you get the following. So in the end, we get v infinities, this vector.
549760	557120	And finally, we get the answer to our question. After infinitely many clicks, which website is
557120	566240	the most important one? Well, website one, followed by website three, followed by website four, followed
566240	575680	by website two. And what is Google? Well, it's the same model, but with many websites. I think
575680	583920	like billions of websites. It's the same idea. Finally, I do want to tell you something cool
583920	591200	because there is a slightly faster way of doing this because it turns out, as you may have noticed,
591200	598000	we didn't even have to calculate the other eigenvectors. All that really mattered is the
598000	609120	eigenvalue one. And in fact, there's a theorem that says what is v infinity is just the eigenvector
609120	623360	corresponding to one, which is two-thirds, three-halves, and one, but not quite because, well,
623360	633360	this is not a probability vector. Well, but it is this, but divided by the sum of the terms. So
633360	643360	two plus two-thirds plus three-halves plus one. And so in the end, you do get this vector 0.38,
643360	653200	0.12, 0.29, 0.19. How cool is that? All right. I hope you like this. And if you want to see
