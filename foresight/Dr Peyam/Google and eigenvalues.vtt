00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
Thanks for watching and let me show you the math behind Google, at least the way it used to work

00:05.760 --> 00:14.880
back in the 90s. Because when I was younger and we had other search websites like Yahoo or Excite,

00:14.880 --> 00:21.120
it was quite a nightmare. Because if you were trying to look for a website about apples,

00:21.120 --> 00:27.200
the one that would get the most hits was one where it just said apples, apples, apples, apples,

00:27.200 --> 00:34.880
apples, apples, which was not very useful. But then came Google and life was much easier because

00:34.880 --> 00:42.160
they use what's called the page rank model, which looks as follows. Because suppose you have four

00:42.160 --> 00:49.840
websites which are connected as follows. So from three, you can go to one, from one, you can go to

00:49.840 --> 00:57.360
two, three, and four. Then the way Google works is that it assigns what's called an importance vector.

00:58.320 --> 01:14.400
Let's call it V. And suppose V is, for instance, 0.2, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.3. Then what that means is that

01:14.400 --> 01:21.280
the highest number is better. So website three is more important than website four,

01:21.280 --> 01:26.000
which is more important than website one, which is more important than website two.

01:26.640 --> 01:34.960
So three would get suggested first and then four and then one and two. Now, how do we determine

01:34.960 --> 01:41.360
that importance vector? Well, with just a little bit of linear algebra and probability.

01:45.120 --> 01:56.800
Because what we need is some initial vector. So assume all four websites are treated equally.

01:56.800 --> 02:06.960
So assume our initial vector is just 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.25.

02:06.960 --> 02:19.200
And some way of transitioning from the initial vector to the next step. And for this, we need

02:19.200 --> 02:26.240
something called a transition matrix. And in order to find a transition matrix, we need some

02:26.240 --> 02:34.480
probabilities. And you'll see why. In particular, think of it as follows. Suppose you start with

02:34.480 --> 02:42.880
website one. What are the chances of going to website two? Well, there's three possibilities,

02:42.880 --> 02:50.240
two, four, or three. And so in particular, from one to two, there's a third chance

02:50.240 --> 02:58.960
of landing to website two. So one third, one third, one third. And well, then we can just

02:58.960 --> 03:06.480
complete the other arrows as follows. So it's a nice exercise to show that the other probabilities

03:06.480 --> 03:15.200
are as follows. And this allows us to calculate our transition matrix. And the way you read the

03:15.200 --> 03:24.160
transition matrix is from top to left. And so this is website one, two, three, four, one, two,

03:24.160 --> 03:31.280
three, four. And you have to ask yourselves, well, to go from website one back to website one,

03:31.920 --> 03:38.880
where there's no self-linkage here. So the probability is zero. To go from two to one,

03:39.440 --> 03:46.240
again, two does not connect to one. The probability is zero. To go from three to one,

03:47.120 --> 03:53.280
well, there's just one connection here. So the probability is one. And let's say to go from

03:53.360 --> 04:02.000
four to one, the probability is one-half. And well, then you can do the same spiel with websites

04:02.000 --> 04:09.440
two, three, and four. And you end up getting the following matrix. Ta-da! Magic, isn't it?

04:10.560 --> 04:16.400
Now, what are we trying to answer, by the way? We want to figure out in the end,

04:16.400 --> 04:24.080
which website is the most important one. And in order to simplify, we just want to ask ourselves,

04:24.080 --> 04:31.920
what happens if we let this run infinitely many times? So what happens after infinitely many clicks?

04:32.480 --> 04:38.480
And well, in order to do this, we first need to figure out what happens after one click.

04:39.360 --> 04:47.760
Well, if you think about this, in order to go from the initial vector to what happens next,

04:47.760 --> 04:57.680
you just have to apply a once. So v1 is av0. And well, to figure out what happens

04:58.480 --> 05:07.200
after two clicks, so to figure out v2, that's just what happens when you apply a to the first step.

05:08.160 --> 05:18.800
So av1. But remember, v1 itself is transitioned, so it's just av0. And that becomes a squared v0.

05:20.400 --> 05:28.000
How cool is that? Using a squared, you can directly go from nothing to the second step.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.720
It's like a teleportation. And in particular, to go directly from the initial step to the

05:36.720 --> 05:46.160
end step, you just have to calculate a to the n. So a to the n v0. And of course,

05:46.160 --> 05:54.880
nothing prevents us from plugging in infinity here. So in particular, the answer to our question,

05:54.880 --> 06:06.080
v infinity, it's a infinity times v0. And so really, all we just need to answer is the question,

06:06.080 --> 06:15.760
what is a infinity? And this is where linear algebra can help us. And so the next step is to

06:15.760 --> 06:24.800
use some linear algebra where we diagonalize a. So it turns out a is pdp inverse. And if you do the

06:24.800 --> 06:35.840
calculation or use Wolfram Alpha, you get d is a diagonal matrix with one entry is one. And that

06:35.840 --> 06:44.160
one's super important. The other one are very small. So let's call them epsilon, delta, I don't

06:44.160 --> 06:55.120
know why not xi. And for p, we have the following. So again, only the first eigenvector matters.

06:55.120 --> 07:03.360
You'll see why. And I think we get two, two thirds, three halves. And I believe one.

07:05.520 --> 07:14.000
And the rest we don't really care. And why is this important? Because this decomposition

07:14.000 --> 07:23.920
allows us to calculate any power of a quite easily. Because for instance, a squared, that is a a,

07:24.800 --> 07:34.960
which is pdp inverse, pdp inverse, and p inverse and p cancels out. And you get pd squared p inverse.

07:35.920 --> 07:44.800
So a squared is pd squared p inverse. And in general, a to the n is pd to the n p inverse.

07:45.680 --> 07:53.520
But as we'll see soon, d to the n is very easy to calculate, which allows us to calculate a to the

07:53.520 --> 08:03.600
n in a much easier way. And nothing prevents us from letting n go to infinity. So in fact,

08:03.600 --> 08:15.040
the stuff that we want, v infinity, it's a infinity v naught, which just becomes pd infinity p naught,

08:15.120 --> 08:32.000
or p inverse of v naught, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25. But what is d to the infinity? Remember, those

08:32.000 --> 08:39.760
eigenvalues are very small. So if you raise them to infinity, you get zero. So in the end,

08:39.760 --> 08:53.120
we get 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So this huge mess that seems very hard to calculate

08:53.120 --> 09:00.960
actually becomes quite easy. And if you actually do the calculation, which I'll skip because there's

09:01.040 --> 09:09.120
a nicer way very soon, you get the following. So in the end, we get v infinities, this vector.

09:09.760 --> 09:17.120
And finally, we get the answer to our question. After infinitely many clicks, which website is

09:17.120 --> 09:26.240
the most important one? Well, website one, followed by website three, followed by website four, followed

09:26.240 --> 09:35.680
by website two. And what is Google? Well, it's the same model, but with many websites. I think

09:35.680 --> 09:43.920
like billions of websites. It's the same idea. Finally, I do want to tell you something cool

09:43.920 --> 09:51.200
because there is a slightly faster way of doing this because it turns out, as you may have noticed,

09:51.200 --> 09:58.000
we didn't even have to calculate the other eigenvectors. All that really mattered is the

09:58.000 --> 10:09.120
eigenvalue one. And in fact, there's a theorem that says what is v infinity is just the eigenvector

10:09.120 --> 10:23.360
corresponding to one, which is two-thirds, three-halves, and one, but not quite because, well,

10:23.360 --> 10:33.360
this is not a probability vector. Well, but it is this, but divided by the sum of the terms. So

10:33.360 --> 10:43.360
two plus two-thirds plus three-halves plus one. And so in the end, you do get this vector 0.38,

10:43.360 --> 10:53.200
0.12, 0.29, 0.19. How cool is that? All right. I hope you like this. And if you want to see
