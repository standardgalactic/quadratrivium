00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Thanks for watching and let me show you the math behind Google, at least the way it used to work

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:14,880
back in the 90s. Because when I was younger and we had other search websites like Yahoo or Excite,

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,120
it was quite a nightmare. Because if you were trying to look for a website about apples,

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,200
the one that would get the most hits was one where it just said apples, apples, apples, apples,

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:34,880
apples, apples, which was not very useful. But then came Google and life was much easier because

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,160
they use what's called the page rank model, which looks as follows. Because suppose you have four

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,840
websites which are connected as follows. So from three, you can go to one, from one, you can go to

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,360
two, three, and four. Then the way Google works is that it assigns what's called an importance vector.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:14,400
Let's call it V. And suppose V is, for instance, 0.2, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.3. Then what that means is that

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,280
the highest number is better. So website three is more important than website four,

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
which is more important than website one, which is more important than website two.

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,960
So three would get suggested first and then four and then one and two. Now, how do we determine

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,360
that importance vector? Well, with just a little bit of linear algebra and probability.

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:56,800
Because what we need is some initial vector. So assume all four websites are treated equally.

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:06,960
So assume our initial vector is just 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.25.

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:19,200
And some way of transitioning from the initial vector to the next step. And for this, we need

17
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,240
something called a transition matrix. And in order to find a transition matrix, we need some

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,480
probabilities. And you'll see why. In particular, think of it as follows. Suppose you start with

19
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,880
website one. What are the chances of going to website two? Well, there's three possibilities,

20
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,240
two, four, or three. And so in particular, from one to two, there's a third chance

21
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:58,960
of landing to website two. So one third, one third, one third. And well, then we can just

22
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,480
complete the other arrows as follows. So it's a nice exercise to show that the other probabilities

23
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:15,200
are as follows. And this allows us to calculate our transition matrix. And the way you read the

24
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:24,160
transition matrix is from top to left. And so this is website one, two, three, four, one, two,

25
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,280
three, four. And you have to ask yourselves, well, to go from website one back to website one,

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,880
where there's no self-linkage here. So the probability is zero. To go from two to one,

27
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,240
again, two does not connect to one. The probability is zero. To go from three to one,

28
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,280
well, there's just one connection here. So the probability is one. And let's say to go from

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:02,000
four to one, the probability is one-half. And well, then you can do the same spiel with websites

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,440
two, three, and four. And you end up getting the following matrix. Ta-da! Magic, isn't it?

31
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,400
Now, what are we trying to answer, by the way? We want to figure out in the end,

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:24,080
which website is the most important one. And in order to simplify, we just want to ask ourselves,

33
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,920
what happens if we let this run infinitely many times? So what happens after infinitely many clicks?

34
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,480
And well, in order to do this, we first need to figure out what happens after one click.

35
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,760
Well, if you think about this, in order to go from the initial vector to what happens next,

36
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:57,680
you just have to apply a once. So v1 is av0. And well, to figure out what happens

37
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:07,200
after two clicks, so to figure out v2, that's just what happens when you apply a to the first step.

38
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:18,800
So av1. But remember, v1 itself is transitioned, so it's just av0. And that becomes a squared v0.

39
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:28,000
How cool is that? Using a squared, you can directly go from nothing to the second step.

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,720
It's like a teleportation. And in particular, to go directly from the initial step to the

41
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:46,160
end step, you just have to calculate a to the n. So a to the n v0. And of course,

42
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:54,880
nothing prevents us from plugging in infinity here. So in particular, the answer to our question,

43
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:06,080
v infinity, it's a infinity times v0. And so really, all we just need to answer is the question,

44
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:15,760
what is a infinity? And this is where linear algebra can help us. And so the next step is to

45
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:24,800
use some linear algebra where we diagonalize a. So it turns out a is pdp inverse. And if you do the

46
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:35,840
calculation or use Wolfram Alpha, you get d is a diagonal matrix with one entry is one. And that

47
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:44,160
one's super important. The other one are very small. So let's call them epsilon, delta, I don't

48
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:55,120
know why not xi. And for p, we have the following. So again, only the first eigenvector matters.

49
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:03,360
You'll see why. And I think we get two, two thirds, three halves. And I believe one.

50
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:14,000
And the rest we don't really care. And why is this important? Because this decomposition

51
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,920
allows us to calculate any power of a quite easily. Because for instance, a squared, that is a a,

52
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,960
which is pdp inverse, pdp inverse, and p inverse and p cancels out. And you get pd squared p inverse.

53
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:44,800
So a squared is pd squared p inverse. And in general, a to the n is pd to the n p inverse.

54
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,520
But as we'll see soon, d to the n is very easy to calculate, which allows us to calculate a to the

55
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:03,600
n in a much easier way. And nothing prevents us from letting n go to infinity. So in fact,

56
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:15,040
the stuff that we want, v infinity, it's a infinity v naught, which just becomes pd infinity p naught,

57
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:32,000
or p inverse of v naught, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25. But what is d to the infinity? Remember, those

58
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,760
eigenvalues are very small. So if you raise them to infinity, you get zero. So in the end,

59
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:53,120
we get 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So this huge mess that seems very hard to calculate

60
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,960
actually becomes quite easy. And if you actually do the calculation, which I'll skip because there's

61
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:09,120
a nicer way very soon, you get the following. So in the end, we get v infinities, this vector.

62
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,120
And finally, we get the answer to our question. After infinitely many clicks, which website is

63
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:26,240
the most important one? Well, website one, followed by website three, followed by website four, followed

64
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,680
by website two. And what is Google? Well, it's the same model, but with many websites. I think

65
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,920
like billions of websites. It's the same idea. Finally, I do want to tell you something cool

66
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,200
because there is a slightly faster way of doing this because it turns out, as you may have noticed,

67
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,000
we didn't even have to calculate the other eigenvectors. All that really mattered is the

68
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:09,120
eigenvalue one. And in fact, there's a theorem that says what is v infinity is just the eigenvector

69
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:23,360
corresponding to one, which is two-thirds, three-halves, and one, but not quite because, well,

70
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:33,360
this is not a probability vector. Well, but it is this, but divided by the sum of the terms. So

71
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:43,360
two plus two-thirds plus three-halves plus one. And so in the end, you do get this vector 0.38,

72
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:53,200
0.12, 0.29, 0.19. How cool is that? All right. I hope you like this. And if you want to see
