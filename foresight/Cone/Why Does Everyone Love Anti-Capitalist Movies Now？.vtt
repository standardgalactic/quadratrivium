00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
These three movies made a crazy amount of money, all while critically exploring the

00:06.920 --> 00:09.320
negative aspects of capitalism.

00:09.320 --> 00:14.280
Squid Game is one of the most watched shows ever made, and it's all about how much it

00:14.280 --> 00:17.360
sucks to be poor, even in a rich country.

00:17.360 --> 00:23.320
From social meditations to fantastical dystopias, movies are increasingly challenging capitalist

00:23.320 --> 00:26.760
ideologies and narratives, without meeting any resistance.

00:26.760 --> 00:31.120
So in this video, we're going to get into why these critiques are finally resonating

00:31.120 --> 00:38.640
with audiences, why art is so good at communicating these hard-hitting political ideas, and why

00:38.640 --> 00:42.120
no one ever seems to understand the endings of these movies.

00:42.120 --> 00:47.760
I mean, like, lots of people don't seem to understand these endings.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.660
So cards on the table, there are a lot of things wrong with capitalism.

00:52.660 --> 00:55.800
It is fundamentally exploitative.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.440
It's an economic system that requires infinite growth, despite the very planet we live on

01:01.440 --> 01:07.560
having finite resources, which we are over-consuming as it is.

01:07.560 --> 01:12.160
And a capitalist organization of the economy leads to terrible inequality.

01:12.160 --> 01:18.200
In fact, in America today, we are living through the worst wealth inequality since monopolies

01:18.200 --> 01:19.480
were legal.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.080
Just let that sink in for a second.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.360
Why is everyone acting weird, Chosme?

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
No, no, we're not.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.360
Come on.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.360
No, seriously.

01:27.360 --> 01:33.720
But in Hollywood, at least, capitalism is implicitly believed to be fine.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.440
If anything, Hollywood has historically been decidedly pro-capitalism, insofar as such

01:39.440 --> 01:49.000
sentiments befit an ardent patriotism, whether it be the pioneering works of Clint Eastwood,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.040
the refined positions of Aaron Sorkin.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.320
In this building where the president stands, nobody sits.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.440
He made the white people face.

01:58.440 --> 02:04.520
Or the more banal system glorifying work offered by your standard Scorsese Kino.

02:04.520 --> 02:10.120
I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.840
It kind of just makes sense.

02:11.840 --> 02:16.120
I mean, hey, the whole Hollywood system is itself a monopoly.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.520
Gotta get that vertical integration, baby.

02:19.520 --> 02:25.640
But yeah, there have been a number of super pro-capitalist movies in the past.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.440
So why are we seeing this change now?

02:28.440 --> 02:46.480
Well, to understand that, I would like to focus your attention on the 1976 film Rocky.

02:46.480 --> 02:51.800
Because for me, it's a really great encapsulation of this cultural shift that I'm talking about

02:51.800 --> 02:52.800
here.

02:52.800 --> 02:57.040
And I think it's a really good reference point for how art is able to frame ideas.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.840
Because like, objectively, you look at what this Rocky guy is going through and you're

03:00.840 --> 03:05.080
like, Jesus, capitalism is fucking brutal.

03:05.080 --> 03:10.280
But lo and behold, that is actually not the message that Rocky is trying to send, nor

03:10.280 --> 03:13.880
is it the message that people generally read from it.

03:13.880 --> 03:20.360
To refresh your memory, Rocky is about a very poor boxer and total loner who gets a chance

03:20.360 --> 03:26.760
to fight an expedition match against the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.280
And through his journey to the fight, he builds the family he never had.

03:31.280 --> 03:36.880
Though he ultimately loses, the fight propels him into fame and fortune.

03:36.880 --> 03:41.960
Thematically, Rocky is about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.

03:41.960 --> 03:48.120
It's trying to say, you are the only thing holding you back in life.

03:48.120 --> 03:54.320
That life isn't always fair, but you can always do more to make the most of it.

03:54.320 --> 03:59.400
To quote Peter Traver's review for Rolling Stone, what makes Rocky so moving is that

03:59.400 --> 04:04.760
we come to care about this working class hero, this underdog who's never been given a fair

04:04.760 --> 04:05.960
shake in life.

04:05.960 --> 04:10.120
And when he gets his chance, he seizes it with all his might.

04:10.120 --> 04:15.600
It's a movie about this quintessentially proletarian guy who somehow finds himself

04:15.600 --> 04:26.040
catapulted into unimaginable wealth and recognition, and there's a lot of humor in that.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.480
And it's very human.

04:27.480 --> 04:32.520
It's cathartic to see a genuinely nice guy succeed in life.

04:32.520 --> 04:37.920
Because the movie starts, and Rocky is just so damned down on his luck, it's crazy.

04:37.920 --> 04:42.960
Like he's being forced to make a living by beating people up for a local mobster, even

04:42.960 --> 04:45.440
though he feels terrible about it.

04:45.440 --> 04:56.480
And he's kicked out of his boxing gym because everyone thinks he's just a washed up loser.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.640
They all tell him it's time to give up on boxing, which is like, you know, this guy's

05:00.640 --> 05:01.640
whole thing.

05:01.640 --> 05:07.840
But yeah, ultimately, with a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work, he rises above

05:07.840 --> 05:09.480
his station in life.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.000
Again, it's a nice sentimental movie.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.880
But even wrapped up in that brief synopsis, there are just so many interesting contradictions.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.960
Right off the bat, you're like, why is this guy feeling bad about being paid to hurt people

05:24.960 --> 05:32.240
on the street, but living for the opportunity to hurt people for money in the ring?

05:32.240 --> 05:37.400
But more than that, you're like, why is this guy's dog named the butt kiss?

05:37.400 --> 05:43.120
No, you're like, how is it supposed to be heartwarming that this one guy was able to

05:43.120 --> 05:47.600
get out of poverty, but everyone else still has to just suck it up?

05:47.600 --> 05:52.360
Rocky seizes his chance and all, but he's the only one that even gets a chance.

05:52.360 --> 05:57.720
The premise of the movie is that Creed only invites Rocky to fight him so that he can

05:57.720 --> 06:02.160
exploit Rocky's identity and body for money.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.720
You see, Creed had his real fight canceled at the last second, so he quickly throws

06:06.720 --> 06:10.560
together another amateur fight so that he can recuperate some money.

06:10.560 --> 06:15.880
And he's like, oh, I should fight a local white guy so we can get a little underdog

06:15.880 --> 06:21.760
thing going, but also get the racist out there fired up, because that's what he thinks

06:21.760 --> 06:25.960
will draw the biggest crowd, thereby making him the most money.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.960
That's the catalyst of the entire plot.

06:28.960 --> 06:34.960
Creed thinks Rocky is the most easily exploitable guy in the whole world.

06:34.960 --> 06:40.440
And I find it interesting, because again, Rocky is completely ashamed of the way he

06:40.440 --> 06:41.640
makes a living.

06:41.640 --> 06:47.760
When he's working as mob muscle, he explicitly feels that his body is being exploited to

06:47.760 --> 06:50.760
hurt people, and it kills him inside.

06:50.760 --> 06:57.440
But interestingly, whenever he gets into the ring, the hyper-commercialized ring, all of

06:57.440 --> 06:59.960
those concerns go away.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.960
And the movie doesn't really bother to explore that.

07:02.960 --> 07:09.520
Like do you somehow feel less exploited, the more money you're making someone else,

07:09.520 --> 07:10.640
Rocky?

07:10.640 --> 07:16.600
But instead of exploring those interesting ideas myself, I'd like to instead contrast

07:16.600 --> 07:22.040
these themes to what I think is a pretty fundamentally similar story, Squid Game.

07:22.040 --> 07:27.760
Like Rocky, Squid Game is a rags to riches story about a proletarian protagonist who

07:27.760 --> 07:32.680
puts his body on the line to seize his chance at escaping poverty.

07:32.680 --> 07:37.400
But that description doesn't quite sit right with you if you've seen the show.

07:37.400 --> 07:42.080
This is a much more brutal narrative, I guess?

07:42.080 --> 07:49.320
In Squid Game, we follow Sunggyun as he progresses through a series of absurd, deadly games in

07:49.320 --> 07:56.920
an effort to win enough money to put all of his worldly obligations, fears, and trauma

07:56.920 --> 07:58.600
to rest.

07:58.600 --> 08:05.920
But ah ah ah, the journey to this cash prize brings with it a whole new catalog of obligations,

08:05.920 --> 08:15.120
fears, and trauma, which tragically scar him and arguably only make his life worse.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.680
In a lot of ways, it's a much less grounded show.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.560
Like obviously you can compare these two shots and see that.

08:22.560 --> 08:28.120
But I actually want to delve a little bit deeper here and ask you to really think just

08:28.120 --> 08:35.960
how grounded or realistic it is for a street in Philadelphia to have absolutely zero activity

08:35.960 --> 08:38.240
outside of our main character.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.160
Like why are there no cars parked here?

08:41.160 --> 08:46.600
For me, it's because Rocky is framing its story as this one man rising above.

08:46.600 --> 08:51.600
He's not being supported by a community, he's hyper-atomized from others.

08:51.600 --> 08:56.440
But he makes it big, and he's happy, so shut the f*** about it, right?

08:56.440 --> 09:01.920
Rocky is trying to tell this rugged individual narrative, and to do so it brings in some

09:01.920 --> 09:06.200
completely unrealistic elements to drive that point home.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.860
Like this fight right here.

09:07.860 --> 09:12.080
This looks more like a WWE fight than a boxing match.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.120
And that's what stories do.

09:14.120 --> 09:19.360
They try to give you some distance from reality so that you can easily engage with the story

09:19.360 --> 09:21.400
itself and its themes.

09:21.400 --> 09:26.960
So when you're making art that is trying to really engage with harder hitting anti-status

09:26.960 --> 09:33.340
quo ideas, ideas that some people would consider dangerous, it's often more effective to write

09:33.340 --> 09:37.780
up a more fantastical setting so that the distance is large enough for the viewers to

09:37.780 --> 09:40.560
safely engage with those themes.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.860
Take the Avatar films for example.

09:42.860 --> 09:48.520
Obviously, Avatar is trying to make some commentaries on Native American genocide and capitalism's

09:48.520 --> 09:50.780
destruction of natural beauty.

09:50.780 --> 09:56.340
But in James Cameron's case, it was a lot more conducive to construct this allegorical

09:56.340 --> 10:01.500
world of Pandora and the Navi than it was to try and write a period piece.

10:01.500 --> 10:06.100
How are you going to make a tasteful action scene this sick if it's limited by historical

10:06.100 --> 10:08.460
accuracy and cultural sensitivity?

10:08.460 --> 10:09.580
You can't.

10:09.580 --> 10:15.140
By exaggerating certain elements or taking them to their extreme conclusion, media can

10:15.140 --> 10:20.580
draw attention to underlying issues that might otherwise be overlooked or taken for granted.

10:20.580 --> 10:26.420
Put another way, visual metaphors are an effective way of communicating complex ideas.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.520
With Squid Game, you see an exaggeration of Rocky, right?

10:30.520 --> 10:35.780
You see these people killing each other, rather than just beating one another senseless.

10:35.780 --> 10:43.900
You see these disgusting, degenerate rich people paying to see murder for their own entertainment.

10:43.900 --> 10:50.340
Contrast that with the folks at home, cheering them on, merely enjoying a sporting spectacle.

10:50.340 --> 10:56.220
Squid Game has to be a little bit larger than life because it's making a legitimate criticism

10:56.220 --> 11:01.780
of these systems of poverty rather than just telling you a rags to riches story.

11:01.780 --> 11:05.900
It's trying to point out that everything outside of the game is, by and large, just

11:05.900 --> 11:08.540
as arbitrary as the game itself.

11:08.540 --> 11:15.660
That the powerlessness of being literally murdered for losing a game of tug of war is

11:15.660 --> 11:21.620
not dissimilar to the powerlessness of being unable to pay for your mother's surgery.

11:21.620 --> 11:27.860
But to really nail those points home, Squid Game actually chooses to be much more grounded

11:27.860 --> 11:31.500
in realistic human behaviors than Rocky.

11:31.500 --> 11:36.820
Throughout Squid Game, there is a much greater emphasis on the desperation and debilitating

11:36.820 --> 11:40.340
stress of poverty than there ever is in Rocky.

11:40.340 --> 11:45.260
After the very first game, wherein more than half of the original contestants are killed,

11:45.260 --> 11:49.140
the survivors narrowly vote to end the games and go home.

11:49.140 --> 11:50.140
That's it.

11:50.140 --> 11:54.420
This second episode, and these people are already done with the eponymous Squid Game,

11:54.420 --> 11:59.060
they just saw hundreds of people murdered in front of them and they want to get out

11:59.060 --> 12:00.140
of there.

12:00.140 --> 12:03.900
And this is where the show is really at its best.

12:03.900 --> 12:09.420
Because in a series of vignettes, we see all of our characters return to their home lives

12:09.420 --> 12:16.340
a bit shaken up, but nevertheless palpably grateful to be free.

12:16.340 --> 12:23.660
That is, until the reality of their situations set in, until they are all of them reminded

12:23.660 --> 12:28.340
of the inherent brutality of their everyday lives.

12:28.340 --> 12:36.300
In the second episode, so aptly named Hell, the show puts in the work to make clear that

12:36.300 --> 12:40.460
every single day is a struggle.

12:40.460 --> 12:47.380
That poverty never gives you a moment's rest, and that no matter how much you love your

12:47.380 --> 12:55.020
friends and family, or how much potential you have, poverty simply prevents joy.

12:55.020 --> 13:01.900
So we watch as nearly every survivor of the first match reluctantly decides to return.

13:01.900 --> 13:06.980
We understand why they choose to subject themselves to the arena.

13:06.980 --> 13:10.460
But they never really had a choice to begin with.

13:10.460 --> 13:16.300
I think that Squid Game creator Huang Donghuk's personal experience with poverty really bleeds

13:16.300 --> 13:19.940
through the script, because it reads very true.

13:19.940 --> 13:24.820
In fact, while he was writing Squid Game itself, he was so poor that he had to sell

13:24.820 --> 13:28.860
the computer he wrote it on, just to afford rent.

13:28.860 --> 13:31.340
Which is genuinely tragic.

13:31.340 --> 13:36.580
Because of systemic inequality, we very nearly did not have this really excellent piece of

13:36.580 --> 13:38.140
media at all.

13:38.140 --> 13:43.220
And this man almost went through life with his talent and hard work unrecognized and

13:43.220 --> 13:44.580
unrewarded.

13:44.580 --> 13:49.300
So maybe that's why he had the wherewithal to create this show, right?

13:49.300 --> 13:54.540
Maybe he could never have made a Rocky, because he knows what it's really like to live on

13:54.540 --> 13:55.700
the brink.

13:55.700 --> 14:03.020
Even though he himself was able to seize his opportunity to escape poverty, just like Rocky,

14:03.020 --> 14:06.940
he knows that that's not really what life is like.

14:06.940 --> 14:12.180
Did you know that Sylvester Stallone actually had to sell his dog while he was running Rocky?

14:12.180 --> 14:19.620
Yeah, he was so poor that he couldn't afford dog food, so he sold his dog for $50.

14:19.620 --> 14:20.780
Just like Huang.

14:20.780 --> 14:23.660
To me, actually, that sounds even more desperate.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.620
Wouldn't you agree, dear viewer?

14:25.620 --> 14:30.540
And yeah, like Huang, luckily he ended up selling the script to make Rocky, so he didn't have

14:30.540 --> 14:34.300
to suffer through those terrible circumstances forever.

14:34.300 --> 14:39.060
And rest assured, the first thing he did with that money is buy Buck his back for a whopping

14:39.060 --> 14:40.060
$3,000.

14:40.060 --> 14:42.940
Yes, that is right, folks.

14:42.940 --> 14:46.300
He used his own real dog in the movie.

14:46.300 --> 14:52.180
This man named his dog Butt Kiss in IRL.

14:52.180 --> 14:55.460
But what's the damn disconnect, right?

14:55.460 --> 15:01.820
If Stallone struggled just as hard as Huang, why are the products of those struggles so

15:01.820 --> 15:02.820
different?

15:02.820 --> 15:07.580
Well, I can't speak to the hearts of these two men, but I think Sylvester Stallone was

15:07.580 --> 15:13.380
perfectly capable of writing a harder hitting, truer story than Rocky.

15:13.380 --> 15:18.700
But that simply wasn't the cultural zeitgeist of the time in the way that it is today.

15:18.700 --> 15:24.060
Now I don't want to pretend that anti-capitalist themes are like a totally new phenomenon

15:24.060 --> 15:27.620
in media, nor that they are newly popular.

15:27.620 --> 15:35.140
Obviously, Fight Club, Wally, and The Matrix all exist, and they were all enormously successful,

15:35.140 --> 15:39.100
along with being coherent criticisms of capitalism.

15:39.100 --> 15:53.500
With the exception of Fight Club.

15:53.500 --> 15:57.940
So maybe you could say this trend isn't actually all that new.

15:57.940 --> 16:03.060
But it's definitely the case that people are more willing to engage with seriously revolutionary

16:03.060 --> 16:06.100
ideas now than they were 10 years ago.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.380
And here's my hot take.

16:07.380 --> 16:12.620
I think that is largely because of the attention account, and more specifically the manner in

16:12.620 --> 16:16.740
which capital C content is created within it.

16:16.740 --> 16:22.300
In fact, I go as far as to say that this cultural shift against capitalism is the inevitable

16:22.300 --> 16:25.100
result of living within this media environment.

16:25.100 --> 16:29.500
Now, I recognize that that is a pretty significant claim to make.

16:29.500 --> 16:34.460
But not to worry, I will match it with pretty significant argumentation.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.580
Consider the following as context.

16:36.580 --> 16:43.940
Virtually everyone has phones which can access like every interesting thing ever all of the

16:43.940 --> 16:44.940
time.

16:44.940 --> 16:51.100
And those phones also allow you to easily create your own content and share anything you find

16:51.100 --> 16:55.900
interesting to pretty much everyone you know through social media.

16:55.900 --> 16:59.820
That represents an enormous shift in the media landscape.

16:59.820 --> 17:05.460
We can now consume magnitudes more media than ever before, and we do.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.660
Here are a couple of statistics for you.

17:07.660 --> 17:12.540
According to Statista, consumption of digital media in America has almost doubled in the

17:12.540 --> 17:17.980
last 10 years, and it has increased every single year since they started recording.

17:17.980 --> 17:22.820
Now let's take a look at YouTube's growth.

17:22.820 --> 17:28.780
Back in 2009, YouTube had about 24 hours of content uploaded to it every minute, which

17:28.780 --> 17:35.460
is a lot, 1,440 times as much content as time itself.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.460
Now that number is over 500 hours.

17:38.460 --> 17:39.460
Every minute.

17:39.460 --> 17:43.260
Golly, that's why you guys need to like and subscribe at this moment.

17:43.260 --> 17:47.940
Right a friggin' comment while you're down there too, I mean, guy like me.

17:47.940 --> 17:53.180
But I knew, one last stat for you, lest you think this increased media consumption is

17:53.180 --> 17:56.020
just thanks to the proliferation of smartphones.

17:56.020 --> 18:03.620
The number of scripted TV shows produced in the United States has increased from 288 shows

18:03.620 --> 18:09.020
in 2012 to 599 in 2022.

18:09.020 --> 18:16.260
And that has also increased every year, with the exception of 2020 because of COVID lockdowns.

18:16.260 --> 18:20.140
Point being, there's way more stuff to watch than ever before.

18:20.140 --> 18:24.420
In the past, people had TVs, and TVs had cable.

18:24.420 --> 18:30.060
The networks chose what to air and when, which forced the consumer to more or less wade through

18:30.060 --> 18:32.780
all the crap to find the stuff they liked.

18:32.780 --> 18:38.220
But now, we use streaming services and social media, which show you whatever you want whenever

18:38.220 --> 18:39.220
you want it.

18:39.220 --> 18:42.780
To keep track of all that, those platforms have algorithms.

18:42.780 --> 18:47.260
Whenever we're watching something, we're doing so under the watchful eye of an algorithm

18:47.260 --> 18:52.500
that tries to find patterns in what we do and don't like, and synthesize that information

18:52.500 --> 18:55.820
so that it can wade through all the crap for us.

18:55.820 --> 19:00.940
Though they do still leave a whole lot to be desired in that regard.

19:00.940 --> 19:05.700
But regardless, they're trying to personalize our media consumption in order to keep us

19:05.700 --> 19:07.380
using their platform.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.500
And that's created a happy little accident.

19:09.500 --> 19:14.140
It is now much easier for creators to find an audience for media that might not have

19:14.140 --> 19:17.060
been considered viable 10 or 15 years ago.

19:17.060 --> 19:20.020
Like live streaming, obviously, did not exist.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.220
And that's huge.

19:21.220 --> 19:27.060
The video essay community, that didn't exist, and that's not quite as huge.

19:27.060 --> 19:32.860
But as it pertains to this video, with algorithms driving content recommendations, there is

19:32.860 --> 19:38.980
a much greater willingness for producers to green light TV shows and movies that tackle

19:38.980 --> 19:42.500
difficult subjects and feature marginalized voices.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.620
For example, take my personal favorite, Bojack Horseman.

19:46.620 --> 19:53.260
An adult animation serial centered on tackling extremely serious mental health challenges

19:53.260 --> 20:00.020
while walking the tightrope of keeping that funny is a difficult pitch.

20:00.020 --> 20:04.180
There were not really a lot of examples you could have compared it to when it was released.

20:04.180 --> 20:08.660
And even being charitable, it's not something you'd think would have mass appeal in the

20:08.660 --> 20:11.620
same way that a traditional sitcom would.

20:11.620 --> 20:15.580
You could maybe argue that the brass over an adult swim would have given it a chance

20:15.580 --> 20:17.540
since it is silly comedy.

20:17.540 --> 20:23.220
But it never would have been the runaway success that it was had it not been in Netflix original.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.780
Or take Orange as the new black.

20:25.780 --> 20:28.420
An absolutely groundbreaking series.

20:28.420 --> 20:33.980
How many cable TV shows in 2013 featured in almost exclusively female cast?

20:33.980 --> 20:39.020
Let alone prominently feature a transgender black woman in their cast.

20:39.020 --> 20:43.820
There's just not a single TV channel at that time who would have greenlit that script with

20:43.820 --> 20:49.220
such frank discussions of gender, race, and sexuality.

20:49.220 --> 20:53.500
And it is thanks to the successes of shows like Orange the new black that marginalized

20:53.500 --> 20:58.140
voices are finally being heard in mainstream TV and film.

20:58.140 --> 21:03.300
That's probably the most critical change that the attention economy has ushered in.

21:03.300 --> 21:10.020
There is now a plethora of content being produced by voices from marginalized communities.

21:10.020 --> 21:15.140
And that content is being pushed just as seriously as anything else on the platforms.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.900
And now, I'm not trying to get too sentimental here, the prominence of such content is not

21:19.900 --> 21:24.460
because we've conquered racism or sexism or any of the isms.

21:24.460 --> 21:30.260
It's because streaming services, social media, and algorithms have afforded us the personalization

21:30.260 --> 21:35.340
technology necessary to get that content out to marginalized people.

21:35.340 --> 21:39.700
Which is all to say the capitalist class has finally realized that marginalized people

21:39.700 --> 21:42.060
are still a marketable demographic.

21:42.060 --> 21:46.660
However, within that there is another happy accident.

21:46.660 --> 21:52.740
Amplifying marginalized voices expose a lot of unmarginalized people to their perspectives

21:52.740 --> 21:57.580
and made them realize that, hey, maybe this is all a touch unfair.

21:57.580 --> 22:03.580
Couple that with the digital activism that comes with social media and the real, unbelievable

22:03.580 --> 22:07.820
growth of wealth inequality in the same time frame.

22:07.820 --> 22:13.820
And it's easy to see why everyone's fiddling around with the idea of replacing capitalism.

22:13.820 --> 22:20.500
Or at least cis-hatero-patriarchal white supremacist capitalism.

22:20.500 --> 22:25.340
God knows we gave it a good go, but I think the contradictions inherent to all of those

22:25.340 --> 22:28.580
systems are becoming overwhelmingly clear.

22:28.580 --> 22:35.180
I think everyone is painfully aware that a lot of the ways our society works don't actually

22:35.180 --> 22:36.180
work.

22:36.180 --> 22:41.820
We are slapped in the face by the very visible inefficiencies of a system in which there are

22:41.820 --> 22:48.940
hundreds of thousands of homeless people, yet there are tens of millions of empty homes.

22:48.940 --> 22:54.380
Like over 30 empty houses per homeless person, 30.

22:54.380 --> 22:59.740
And while everyone is keenly aware of those problems, we are also equally aware of the

22:59.740 --> 23:03.340
shortcomings of non-capitalist societies.

23:03.340 --> 23:08.740
I for one don't feel comfortable supporting pretty much any contemporary political systems

23:08.740 --> 23:13.380
that are currently labeling themselves as socialists, and a lot of people don't really

23:13.380 --> 23:17.620
feel comfortable broadly supporting socialism or capitalism.

23:17.780 --> 23:20.220
These movies play into that.

23:20.220 --> 23:24.660
For the most part, they don't deal with trying to present an alternative.

23:24.660 --> 23:29.580
The media just lays out the relatable criticisms and leaves it at that, which makes them really

23:29.580 --> 23:31.380
easy to support.

23:31.380 --> 23:34.740
That's why no one can ever understand the endings of these movies, by the way.

23:34.740 --> 23:36.740
It's because they're deliberately vague.

23:36.740 --> 23:41.700
They don't want to take a stand and tell you to actually revolt, so they kind of just fizzle

23:41.700 --> 23:42.780
out at the end.

23:42.780 --> 23:48.900
Like when you're watching Parasite, you feel in your body that there is some kind of natural

23:48.900 --> 23:50.340
progression there.

23:50.340 --> 23:54.620
So when there's not riots in the street at the end, you're like, huh?

23:54.620 --> 23:56.740
Is there something I missed?

23:56.740 --> 23:58.380
So that's my theory.

23:58.380 --> 24:02.580
Everyone suddenly loves these anti-capitalist narratives because they're an easy way to

24:02.580 --> 24:08.020
engage with the idea of disliking capitalism without really having to reconcile with the

24:08.020 --> 24:10.860
difficulties of taking political action.

24:10.860 --> 24:15.980
And the reason this phenomenon has become so visible is that the attention economy has

24:15.980 --> 24:21.780
finally given marginalized people the chance to get their stories out there in ways that

24:21.780 --> 24:24.900
were simply not possible in the past.

24:24.900 --> 24:30.340
And that, again, we are currently living through a second gildedage.

24:30.340 --> 24:35.500
Like this is only comparable to that time we let dudes get rich enough to make houses

24:35.500 --> 24:40.020
that have their own fucking Wikipedia pages.

24:40.020 --> 24:46.740
There is a Wikipedia page to list the individual Wikipedia pages of the houses owned by this

24:46.740 --> 24:51.620
one dude, whomst was less rich than Bezos.

24:51.620 --> 24:56.020
That's how many ridiculous fuck off mansions he had.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.420
Just keep that in your back pocket.

24:58.420 --> 25:02.860
And if you're one of those people that is reconciling with the idea that capitalism

25:02.860 --> 25:08.180
is terrible and you're still on the fence, I urge you to take a chance.

25:08.180 --> 25:14.180
Just because there's nothing that I can currently point to for us to emulate does not mean we

25:14.180 --> 25:18.140
don't have the tools necessary to make something special.

25:18.140 --> 25:23.660
A lot of people have thought very hard about how we can improve society and they've spent

25:23.660 --> 25:26.340
a lot of time practicing those ideas.

25:26.340 --> 25:30.140
I'm pretty comfortable saying the solutions are there.

25:30.140 --> 25:32.260
Literally just to unionize your workplace.

25:32.260 --> 25:37.340
It's not as hard as you think, but please let me know what your take is.

25:37.340 --> 25:41.780
Maybe you think this trend is simply capital exerting a further grip on the zeitgeist by

25:41.780 --> 25:44.020
commoditizing their resistance.

25:44.020 --> 25:48.260
Maybe you think this has nothing to do with the proliferation of smartphones at all.

25:48.260 --> 25:51.460
Let me know if you think I'm wrong, or if I just missed something.

25:51.460 --> 25:54.820
I'm genuinely interested in hearing people's thoughts on the subject.

25:54.820 --> 25:59.060
If you're still here, I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to like, comment

25:59.060 --> 26:00.060
and subscribe.

26:00.060 --> 26:03.100
And if you're really amazing, share this with your pals.

26:03.100 --> 26:07.100
Regardless, thank you again for watching and hopefully I'll see you next time.
