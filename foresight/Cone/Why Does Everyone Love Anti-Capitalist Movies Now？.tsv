0	6920	These three movies made a crazy amount of money, all while critically exploring the
6920	9320	negative aspects of capitalism.
9320	14280	Squid Game is one of the most watched shows ever made, and it's all about how much it
14280	17360	sucks to be poor, even in a rich country.
17360	23320	From social meditations to fantastical dystopias, movies are increasingly challenging capitalist
23320	26760	ideologies and narratives, without meeting any resistance.
26760	31120	So in this video, we're going to get into why these critiques are finally resonating
31120	38640	with audiences, why art is so good at communicating these hard-hitting political ideas, and why
38640	42120	no one ever seems to understand the endings of these movies.
42120	47760	I mean, like, lots of people don't seem to understand these endings.
47760	52660	So cards on the table, there are a lot of things wrong with capitalism.
52660	55800	It is fundamentally exploitative.
55800	61440	It's an economic system that requires infinite growth, despite the very planet we live on
61440	67560	having finite resources, which we are over-consuming as it is.
67560	72160	And a capitalist organization of the economy leads to terrible inequality.
72160	78200	In fact, in America today, we are living through the worst wealth inequality since monopolies
78200	79480	were legal.
79480	81080	Just let that sink in for a second.
81080	83360	Why is everyone acting weird, Chosme?
83360	84360	No, no, we're not.
84360	85360	Come on.
85360	87360	No, seriously.
87360	93720	But in Hollywood, at least, capitalism is implicitly believed to be fine.
93720	99440	If anything, Hollywood has historically been decidedly pro-capitalism, insofar as such
99440	109000	sentiments befit an ardent patriotism, whether it be the pioneering works of Clint Eastwood,
109000	112040	the refined positions of Aaron Sorkin.
112040	115320	In this building where the president stands, nobody sits.
115320	118440	He made the white people face.
118440	124520	Or the more banal system glorifying work offered by your standard Scorsese Kino.
124520	130120	I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich.
130120	131840	It kind of just makes sense.
131840	136120	I mean, hey, the whole Hollywood system is itself a monopoly.
136120	139520	Gotta get that vertical integration, baby.
139520	145640	But yeah, there have been a number of super pro-capitalist movies in the past.
145640	148440	So why are we seeing this change now?
148440	166480	Well, to understand that, I would like to focus your attention on the 1976 film Rocky.
166480	171800	Because for me, it's a really great encapsulation of this cultural shift that I'm talking about
171800	172800	here.
172800	177040	And I think it's a really good reference point for how art is able to frame ideas.
177040	180840	Because like, objectively, you look at what this Rocky guy is going through and you're
180840	185080	like, Jesus, capitalism is fucking brutal.
185080	190280	But lo and behold, that is actually not the message that Rocky is trying to send, nor
190280	193880	is it the message that people generally read from it.
193880	200360	To refresh your memory, Rocky is about a very poor boxer and total loner who gets a chance
200360	206760	to fight an expedition match against the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
206760	211280	And through his journey to the fight, he builds the family he never had.
211280	216880	Though he ultimately loses, the fight propels him into fame and fortune.
216880	221960	Thematically, Rocky is about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.
221960	228120	It's trying to say, you are the only thing holding you back in life.
228120	234320	That life isn't always fair, but you can always do more to make the most of it.
234320	239400	To quote Peter Traver's review for Rolling Stone, what makes Rocky so moving is that
239400	244760	we come to care about this working class hero, this underdog who's never been given a fair
244760	245960	shake in life.
245960	250120	And when he gets his chance, he seizes it with all his might.
250120	255600	It's a movie about this quintessentially proletarian guy who somehow finds himself
255600	266040	catapulted into unimaginable wealth and recognition, and there's a lot of humor in that.
266040	267480	And it's very human.
267480	272520	It's cathartic to see a genuinely nice guy succeed in life.
272520	277920	Because the movie starts, and Rocky is just so damned down on his luck, it's crazy.
277920	282960	Like he's being forced to make a living by beating people up for a local mobster, even
282960	285440	though he feels terrible about it.
285440	296480	And he's kicked out of his boxing gym because everyone thinks he's just a washed up loser.
296480	300640	They all tell him it's time to give up on boxing, which is like, you know, this guy's
300640	301640	whole thing.
301640	307840	But yeah, ultimately, with a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work, he rises above
307840	309480	his station in life.
309480	313000	Again, it's a nice sentimental movie.
313000	319880	But even wrapped up in that brief synopsis, there are just so many interesting contradictions.
319880	324960	Right off the bat, you're like, why is this guy feeling bad about being paid to hurt people
324960	332240	on the street, but living for the opportunity to hurt people for money in the ring?
332240	337400	But more than that, you're like, why is this guy's dog named the butt kiss?
337400	343120	No, you're like, how is it supposed to be heartwarming that this one guy was able to
343120	347600	get out of poverty, but everyone else still has to just suck it up?
347600	352360	Rocky seizes his chance and all, but he's the only one that even gets a chance.
352360	357720	The premise of the movie is that Creed only invites Rocky to fight him so that he can
357720	362160	exploit Rocky's identity and body for money.
362160	366720	You see, Creed had his real fight canceled at the last second, so he quickly throws
366720	370560	together another amateur fight so that he can recuperate some money.
370560	375880	And he's like, oh, I should fight a local white guy so we can get a little underdog
375880	381760	thing going, but also get the racist out there fired up, because that's what he thinks
381760	385960	will draw the biggest crowd, thereby making him the most money.
385960	388960	That's the catalyst of the entire plot.
388960	394960	Creed thinks Rocky is the most easily exploitable guy in the whole world.
394960	400440	And I find it interesting, because again, Rocky is completely ashamed of the way he
400440	401640	makes a living.
401640	407760	When he's working as mob muscle, he explicitly feels that his body is being exploited to
407760	410760	hurt people, and it kills him inside.
410760	417440	But interestingly, whenever he gets into the ring, the hyper-commercialized ring, all of
417440	419960	those concerns go away.
419960	422960	And the movie doesn't really bother to explore that.
422960	429520	Like do you somehow feel less exploited, the more money you're making someone else,
429520	430640	Rocky?
430640	436600	But instead of exploring those interesting ideas myself, I'd like to instead contrast
436600	442040	these themes to what I think is a pretty fundamentally similar story, Squid Game.
442040	447760	Like Rocky, Squid Game is a rags to riches story about a proletarian protagonist who
447760	452680	puts his body on the line to seize his chance at escaping poverty.
452680	457400	But that description doesn't quite sit right with you if you've seen the show.
457400	462080	This is a much more brutal narrative, I guess?
462080	469320	In Squid Game, we follow Sunggyun as he progresses through a series of absurd, deadly games in
469320	476920	an effort to win enough money to put all of his worldly obligations, fears, and trauma
476920	478600	to rest.
478600	485920	But ah ah ah, the journey to this cash prize brings with it a whole new catalog of obligations,
485920	495120	fears, and trauma, which tragically scar him and arguably only make his life worse.
495120	498680	In a lot of ways, it's a much less grounded show.
498680	502560	Like obviously you can compare these two shots and see that.
502560	508120	But I actually want to delve a little bit deeper here and ask you to really think just
508120	515960	how grounded or realistic it is for a street in Philadelphia to have absolutely zero activity
515960	518240	outside of our main character.
518240	521160	Like why are there no cars parked here?
521160	526600	For me, it's because Rocky is framing its story as this one man rising above.
526600	531600	He's not being supported by a community, he's hyper-atomized from others.
531600	536440	But he makes it big, and he's happy, so shut the f*** about it, right?
536440	541920	Rocky is trying to tell this rugged individual narrative, and to do so it brings in some
541920	546200	completely unrealistic elements to drive that point home.
546200	547860	Like this fight right here.
547860	552080	This looks more like a WWE fight than a boxing match.
552080	554120	And that's what stories do.
554120	559360	They try to give you some distance from reality so that you can easily engage with the story
559360	561400	itself and its themes.
561400	566960	So when you're making art that is trying to really engage with harder hitting anti-status
566960	573340	quo ideas, ideas that some people would consider dangerous, it's often more effective to write
573340	577780	up a more fantastical setting so that the distance is large enough for the viewers to
577780	580560	safely engage with those themes.
580560	582860	Take the Avatar films for example.
582860	588520	Obviously, Avatar is trying to make some commentaries on Native American genocide and capitalism's
588520	590780	destruction of natural beauty.
590780	596340	But in James Cameron's case, it was a lot more conducive to construct this allegorical
596340	601500	world of Pandora and the Navi than it was to try and write a period piece.
601500	606100	How are you going to make a tasteful action scene this sick if it's limited by historical
606100	608460	accuracy and cultural sensitivity?
608460	609580	You can't.
609580	615140	By exaggerating certain elements or taking them to their extreme conclusion, media can
615140	620580	draw attention to underlying issues that might otherwise be overlooked or taken for granted.
620580	626420	Put another way, visual metaphors are an effective way of communicating complex ideas.
626420	630520	With Squid Game, you see an exaggeration of Rocky, right?
630520	635780	You see these people killing each other, rather than just beating one another senseless.
635780	643900	You see these disgusting, degenerate rich people paying to see murder for their own entertainment.
643900	650340	Contrast that with the folks at home, cheering them on, merely enjoying a sporting spectacle.
650340	656220	Squid Game has to be a little bit larger than life because it's making a legitimate criticism
656220	661780	of these systems of poverty rather than just telling you a rags to riches story.
661780	665900	It's trying to point out that everything outside of the game is, by and large, just
665900	668540	as arbitrary as the game itself.
668540	675660	That the powerlessness of being literally murdered for losing a game of tug of war is
675660	681620	not dissimilar to the powerlessness of being unable to pay for your mother's surgery.
681620	687860	But to really nail those points home, Squid Game actually chooses to be much more grounded
687860	691500	in realistic human behaviors than Rocky.
691500	696820	Throughout Squid Game, there is a much greater emphasis on the desperation and debilitating
696820	700340	stress of poverty than there ever is in Rocky.
700340	705260	After the very first game, wherein more than half of the original contestants are killed,
705260	709140	the survivors narrowly vote to end the games and go home.
709140	710140	That's it.
710140	714420	This second episode, and these people are already done with the eponymous Squid Game,
714420	719060	they just saw hundreds of people murdered in front of them and they want to get out
719060	720140	of there.
720140	723900	And this is where the show is really at its best.
723900	729420	Because in a series of vignettes, we see all of our characters return to their home lives
729420	736340	a bit shaken up, but nevertheless palpably grateful to be free.
736340	743660	That is, until the reality of their situations set in, until they are all of them reminded
743660	748340	of the inherent brutality of their everyday lives.
748340	756300	In the second episode, so aptly named Hell, the show puts in the work to make clear that
756300	760460	every single day is a struggle.
760460	767380	That poverty never gives you a moment's rest, and that no matter how much you love your
767380	775020	friends and family, or how much potential you have, poverty simply prevents joy.
775020	781900	So we watch as nearly every survivor of the first match reluctantly decides to return.
781900	786980	We understand why they choose to subject themselves to the arena.
786980	790460	But they never really had a choice to begin with.
790460	796300	I think that Squid Game creator Huang Donghuk's personal experience with poverty really bleeds
796300	799940	through the script, because it reads very true.
799940	804820	In fact, while he was writing Squid Game itself, he was so poor that he had to sell
804820	808860	the computer he wrote it on, just to afford rent.
808860	811340	Which is genuinely tragic.
811340	816580	Because of systemic inequality, we very nearly did not have this really excellent piece of
816580	818140	media at all.
818140	823220	And this man almost went through life with his talent and hard work unrecognized and
823220	824580	unrewarded.
824580	829300	So maybe that's why he had the wherewithal to create this show, right?
829300	834540	Maybe he could never have made a Rocky, because he knows what it's really like to live on
834540	835700	the brink.
835700	843020	Even though he himself was able to seize his opportunity to escape poverty, just like Rocky,
843020	846940	he knows that that's not really what life is like.
846940	852180	Did you know that Sylvester Stallone actually had to sell his dog while he was running Rocky?
852180	859620	Yeah, he was so poor that he couldn't afford dog food, so he sold his dog for $50.
859620	860780	Just like Huang.
860780	863660	To me, actually, that sounds even more desperate.
863660	865620	Wouldn't you agree, dear viewer?
865620	870540	And yeah, like Huang, luckily he ended up selling the script to make Rocky, so he didn't have
870540	874300	to suffer through those terrible circumstances forever.
874300	879060	And rest assured, the first thing he did with that money is buy Buck his back for a whopping
879060	880060	$3,000.
880060	882940	Yes, that is right, folks.
882940	886300	He used his own real dog in the movie.
886300	892180	This man named his dog Butt Kiss in IRL.
892180	895460	But what's the damn disconnect, right?
895460	901820	If Stallone struggled just as hard as Huang, why are the products of those struggles so
901820	902820	different?
902820	907580	Well, I can't speak to the hearts of these two men, but I think Sylvester Stallone was
907580	913380	perfectly capable of writing a harder hitting, truer story than Rocky.
913380	918700	But that simply wasn't the cultural zeitgeist of the time in the way that it is today.
918700	924060	Now I don't want to pretend that anti-capitalist themes are like a totally new phenomenon
924060	927620	in media, nor that they are newly popular.
927620	935140	Obviously, Fight Club, Wally, and The Matrix all exist, and they were all enormously successful,
935140	939100	along with being coherent criticisms of capitalism.
939100	953500	With the exception of Fight Club.
953500	957940	So maybe you could say this trend isn't actually all that new.
957940	963060	But it's definitely the case that people are more willing to engage with seriously revolutionary
963060	966100	ideas now than they were 10 years ago.
966100	967380	And here's my hot take.
967380	972620	I think that is largely because of the attention account, and more specifically the manner in
972620	976740	which capital C content is created within it.
976740	982300	In fact, I go as far as to say that this cultural shift against capitalism is the inevitable
982300	985100	result of living within this media environment.
985100	989500	Now, I recognize that that is a pretty significant claim to make.
989500	994460	But not to worry, I will match it with pretty significant argumentation.
994460	996580	Consider the following as context.
996580	1003940	Virtually everyone has phones which can access like every interesting thing ever all of the
1003940	1004940	time.
1004940	1011100	And those phones also allow you to easily create your own content and share anything you find
1011100	1015900	interesting to pretty much everyone you know through social media.
1015900	1019820	That represents an enormous shift in the media landscape.
1019820	1025460	We can now consume magnitudes more media than ever before, and we do.
1025460	1027660	Here are a couple of statistics for you.
1027660	1032540	According to Statista, consumption of digital media in America has almost doubled in the
1032540	1037980	last 10 years, and it has increased every single year since they started recording.
1037980	1042820	Now let's take a look at YouTube's growth.
1042820	1048780	Back in 2009, YouTube had about 24 hours of content uploaded to it every minute, which
1048780	1055460	is a lot, 1,440 times as much content as time itself.
1055460	1058460	Now that number is over 500 hours.
1058460	1059460	Every minute.
1059460	1063260	Golly, that's why you guys need to like and subscribe at this moment.
1063260	1067940	Right a friggin' comment while you're down there too, I mean, guy like me.
1067940	1073180	But I knew, one last stat for you, lest you think this increased media consumption is
1073180	1076020	just thanks to the proliferation of smartphones.
1076020	1083620	The number of scripted TV shows produced in the United States has increased from 288 shows
1083620	1089020	in 2012 to 599 in 2022.
1089020	1096260	And that has also increased every year, with the exception of 2020 because of COVID lockdowns.
1096260	1100140	Point being, there's way more stuff to watch than ever before.
1100140	1104420	In the past, people had TVs, and TVs had cable.
1104420	1110060	The networks chose what to air and when, which forced the consumer to more or less wade through
1110060	1112780	all the crap to find the stuff they liked.
1112780	1118220	But now, we use streaming services and social media, which show you whatever you want whenever
1118220	1119220	you want it.
1119220	1122780	To keep track of all that, those platforms have algorithms.
1122780	1127260	Whenever we're watching something, we're doing so under the watchful eye of an algorithm
1127260	1132500	that tries to find patterns in what we do and don't like, and synthesize that information
1132500	1135820	so that it can wade through all the crap for us.
1135820	1140940	Though they do still leave a whole lot to be desired in that regard.
1140940	1145700	But regardless, they're trying to personalize our media consumption in order to keep us
1145700	1147380	using their platform.
1147380	1149500	And that's created a happy little accident.
1149500	1154140	It is now much easier for creators to find an audience for media that might not have
1154140	1157060	been considered viable 10 or 15 years ago.
1157060	1160020	Like live streaming, obviously, did not exist.
1160020	1161220	And that's huge.
1161220	1167060	The video essay community, that didn't exist, and that's not quite as huge.
1167060	1172860	But as it pertains to this video, with algorithms driving content recommendations, there is
1172860	1178980	a much greater willingness for producers to green light TV shows and movies that tackle
1178980	1182500	difficult subjects and feature marginalized voices.
1182500	1186620	For example, take my personal favorite, Bojack Horseman.
1186620	1193260	An adult animation serial centered on tackling extremely serious mental health challenges
1193260	1200020	while walking the tightrope of keeping that funny is a difficult pitch.
1200020	1204180	There were not really a lot of examples you could have compared it to when it was released.
1204180	1208660	And even being charitable, it's not something you'd think would have mass appeal in the
1208660	1211620	same way that a traditional sitcom would.
1211620	1215580	You could maybe argue that the brass over an adult swim would have given it a chance
1215580	1217540	since it is silly comedy.
1217540	1223220	But it never would have been the runaway success that it was had it not been in Netflix original.
1223220	1225780	Or take Orange as the new black.
1225780	1228420	An absolutely groundbreaking series.
1228420	1233980	How many cable TV shows in 2013 featured in almost exclusively female cast?
1233980	1239020	Let alone prominently feature a transgender black woman in their cast.
1239020	1243820	There's just not a single TV channel at that time who would have greenlit that script with
1243820	1249220	such frank discussions of gender, race, and sexuality.
1249220	1253500	And it is thanks to the successes of shows like Orange the new black that marginalized
1253500	1258140	voices are finally being heard in mainstream TV and film.
1258140	1263300	That's probably the most critical change that the attention economy has ushered in.
1263300	1270020	There is now a plethora of content being produced by voices from marginalized communities.
1270020	1275140	And that content is being pushed just as seriously as anything else on the platforms.
1275140	1279900	And now, I'm not trying to get too sentimental here, the prominence of such content is not
1279900	1284460	because we've conquered racism or sexism or any of the isms.
1284460	1290260	It's because streaming services, social media, and algorithms have afforded us the personalization
1290260	1295340	technology necessary to get that content out to marginalized people.
1295340	1299700	Which is all to say the capitalist class has finally realized that marginalized people
1299700	1302060	are still a marketable demographic.
1302060	1306660	However, within that there is another happy accident.
1306660	1312740	Amplifying marginalized voices expose a lot of unmarginalized people to their perspectives
1312740	1317580	and made them realize that, hey, maybe this is all a touch unfair.
1317580	1323580	Couple that with the digital activism that comes with social media and the real, unbelievable
1323580	1327820	growth of wealth inequality in the same time frame.
1327820	1333820	And it's easy to see why everyone's fiddling around with the idea of replacing capitalism.
1333820	1340500	Or at least cis-hatero-patriarchal white supremacist capitalism.
1340500	1345340	God knows we gave it a good go, but I think the contradictions inherent to all of those
1345340	1348580	systems are becoming overwhelmingly clear.
1348580	1355180	I think everyone is painfully aware that a lot of the ways our society works don't actually
1355180	1356180	work.
1356180	1361820	We are slapped in the face by the very visible inefficiencies of a system in which there are
1361820	1368940	hundreds of thousands of homeless people, yet there are tens of millions of empty homes.
1368940	1374380	Like over 30 empty houses per homeless person, 30.
1374380	1379740	And while everyone is keenly aware of those problems, we are also equally aware of the
1379740	1383340	shortcomings of non-capitalist societies.
1383340	1388740	I for one don't feel comfortable supporting pretty much any contemporary political systems
1388740	1393380	that are currently labeling themselves as socialists, and a lot of people don't really
1393380	1397620	feel comfortable broadly supporting socialism or capitalism.
1397780	1400220	These movies play into that.
1400220	1404660	For the most part, they don't deal with trying to present an alternative.
1404660	1409580	The media just lays out the relatable criticisms and leaves it at that, which makes them really
1409580	1411380	easy to support.
1411380	1414740	That's why no one can ever understand the endings of these movies, by the way.
1414740	1416740	It's because they're deliberately vague.
1416740	1421700	They don't want to take a stand and tell you to actually revolt, so they kind of just fizzle
1421700	1422780	out at the end.
1422780	1428900	Like when you're watching Parasite, you feel in your body that there is some kind of natural
1428900	1430340	progression there.
1430340	1434620	So when there's not riots in the street at the end, you're like, huh?
1434620	1436740	Is there something I missed?
1436740	1438380	So that's my theory.
1438380	1442580	Everyone suddenly loves these anti-capitalist narratives because they're an easy way to
1442580	1448020	engage with the idea of disliking capitalism without really having to reconcile with the
1448020	1450860	difficulties of taking political action.
1450860	1455980	And the reason this phenomenon has become so visible is that the attention economy has
1455980	1461780	finally given marginalized people the chance to get their stories out there in ways that
1461780	1464900	were simply not possible in the past.
1464900	1470340	And that, again, we are currently living through a second gildedage.
1470340	1475500	Like this is only comparable to that time we let dudes get rich enough to make houses
1475500	1480020	that have their own fucking Wikipedia pages.
1480020	1486740	There is a Wikipedia page to list the individual Wikipedia pages of the houses owned by this
1486740	1491620	one dude, whomst was less rich than Bezos.
1491620	1496020	That's how many ridiculous fuck off mansions he had.
1496020	1498420	Just keep that in your back pocket.
1498420	1502860	And if you're one of those people that is reconciling with the idea that capitalism
1502860	1508180	is terrible and you're still on the fence, I urge you to take a chance.
1508180	1514180	Just because there's nothing that I can currently point to for us to emulate does not mean we
1514180	1518140	don't have the tools necessary to make something special.
1518140	1523660	A lot of people have thought very hard about how we can improve society and they've spent
1523660	1526340	a lot of time practicing those ideas.
1526340	1530140	I'm pretty comfortable saying the solutions are there.
1530140	1532260	Literally just to unionize your workplace.
1532260	1537340	It's not as hard as you think, but please let me know what your take is.
1537340	1541780	Maybe you think this trend is simply capital exerting a further grip on the zeitgeist by
1541780	1544020	commoditizing their resistance.
1544020	1548260	Maybe you think this has nothing to do with the proliferation of smartphones at all.
1548260	1551460	Let me know if you think I'm wrong, or if I just missed something.
1551460	1554820	I'm genuinely interested in hearing people's thoughts on the subject.
1554820	1559060	If you're still here, I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to like, comment
1559060	1560060	and subscribe.
1560060	1563100	And if you're really amazing, share this with your pals.
1563100	1567100	Regardless, thank you again for watching and hopefully I'll see you next time.
