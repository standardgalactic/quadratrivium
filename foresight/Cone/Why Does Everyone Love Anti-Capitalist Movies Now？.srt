1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
These three movies made a crazy amount of money, all while critically exploring the

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,320
negative aspects of capitalism.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,280
Squid Game is one of the most watched shows ever made, and it's all about how much it

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,360
sucks to be poor, even in a rich country.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,320
From social meditations to fantastical dystopias, movies are increasingly challenging capitalist

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,760
ideologies and narratives, without meeting any resistance.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,120
So in this video, we're going to get into why these critiques are finally resonating

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,640
with audiences, why art is so good at communicating these hard-hitting political ideas, and why

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,120
no one ever seems to understand the endings of these movies.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,760
I mean, like, lots of people don't seem to understand these endings.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,660
So cards on the table, there are a lot of things wrong with capitalism.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,800
It is fundamentally exploitative.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,440
It's an economic system that requires infinite growth, despite the very planet we live on

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,560
having finite resources, which we are over-consuming as it is.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,160
And a capitalist organization of the economy leads to terrible inequality.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,200
In fact, in America today, we are living through the worst wealth inequality since monopolies

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
were legal.

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,080
Just let that sink in for a second.

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,360
Why is everyone acting weird, Chosme?

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
No, no, we're not.

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Come on.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
No, seriously.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,720
But in Hollywood, at least, capitalism is implicitly believed to be fine.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,440
If anything, Hollywood has historically been decidedly pro-capitalism, insofar as such

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:49,000
sentiments befit an ardent patriotism, whether it be the pioneering works of Clint Eastwood,

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,040
the refined positions of Aaron Sorkin.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,320
In this building where the president stands, nobody sits.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,440
He made the white people face.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,520
Or the more banal system glorifying work offered by your standard Scorsese Kino.

30
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,120
I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
It kind of just makes sense.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,120
I mean, hey, the whole Hollywood system is itself a monopoly.

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,520
Gotta get that vertical integration, baby.

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,640
But yeah, there have been a number of super pro-capitalist movies in the past.

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,440
So why are we seeing this change now?

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:46,480
Well, to understand that, I would like to focus your attention on the 1976 film Rocky.

37
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,800
Because for me, it's a really great encapsulation of this cultural shift that I'm talking about

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
here.

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,040
And I think it's a really good reference point for how art is able to frame ideas.

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,840
Because like, objectively, you look at what this Rocky guy is going through and you're

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,080
like, Jesus, capitalism is fucking brutal.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,280
But lo and behold, that is actually not the message that Rocky is trying to send, nor

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,880
is it the message that people generally read from it.

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,360
To refresh your memory, Rocky is about a very poor boxer and total loner who gets a chance

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,760
to fight an expedition match against the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,280
And through his journey to the fight, he builds the family he never had.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,880
Though he ultimately loses, the fight propels him into fame and fortune.

48
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,960
Thematically, Rocky is about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,120
It's trying to say, you are the only thing holding you back in life.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,320
That life isn't always fair, but you can always do more to make the most of it.

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,400
To quote Peter Traver's review for Rolling Stone, what makes Rocky so moving is that

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,760
we come to care about this working class hero, this underdog who's never been given a fair

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
shake in life.

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,120
And when he gets his chance, he seizes it with all his might.

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,600
It's a movie about this quintessentially proletarian guy who somehow finds himself

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:26,040
catapulted into unimaginable wealth and recognition, and there's a lot of humor in that.

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,480
And it's very human.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,520
It's cathartic to see a genuinely nice guy succeed in life.

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,920
Because the movie starts, and Rocky is just so damned down on his luck, it's crazy.

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,960
Like he's being forced to make a living by beating people up for a local mobster, even

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
though he feels terrible about it.

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:56,480
And he's kicked out of his boxing gym because everyone thinks he's just a washed up loser.

63
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,640
They all tell him it's time to give up on boxing, which is like, you know, this guy's

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
whole thing.

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,840
But yeah, ultimately, with a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work, he rises above

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,480
his station in life.

67
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,000
Again, it's a nice sentimental movie.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,880
But even wrapped up in that brief synopsis, there are just so many interesting contradictions.

69
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,960
Right off the bat, you're like, why is this guy feeling bad about being paid to hurt people

70
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,240
on the street, but living for the opportunity to hurt people for money in the ring?

71
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
But more than that, you're like, why is this guy's dog named the butt kiss?

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,120
No, you're like, how is it supposed to be heartwarming that this one guy was able to

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,600
get out of poverty, but everyone else still has to just suck it up?

74
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,360
Rocky seizes his chance and all, but he's the only one that even gets a chance.

75
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,720
The premise of the movie is that Creed only invites Rocky to fight him so that he can

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,160
exploit Rocky's identity and body for money.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
You see, Creed had his real fight canceled at the last second, so he quickly throws

78
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,560
together another amateur fight so that he can recuperate some money.

79
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,880
And he's like, oh, I should fight a local white guy so we can get a little underdog

80
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,760
thing going, but also get the racist out there fired up, because that's what he thinks

81
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,960
will draw the biggest crowd, thereby making him the most money.

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,960
That's the catalyst of the entire plot.

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,960
Creed thinks Rocky is the most easily exploitable guy in the whole world.

84
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,440
And I find it interesting, because again, Rocky is completely ashamed of the way he

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,640
makes a living.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,760
When he's working as mob muscle, he explicitly feels that his body is being exploited to

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,760
hurt people, and it kills him inside.

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:57,440
But interestingly, whenever he gets into the ring, the hyper-commercialized ring, all of

89
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,960
those concerns go away.

90
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,960
And the movie doesn't really bother to explore that.

91
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,520
Like do you somehow feel less exploited, the more money you're making someone else,

92
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,640
Rocky?

93
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,600
But instead of exploring those interesting ideas myself, I'd like to instead contrast

94
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,040
these themes to what I think is a pretty fundamentally similar story, Squid Game.

95
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,760
Like Rocky, Squid Game is a rags to riches story about a proletarian protagonist who

96
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,680
puts his body on the line to seize his chance at escaping poverty.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,400
But that description doesn't quite sit right with you if you've seen the show.

98
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,080
This is a much more brutal narrative, I guess?

99
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,320
In Squid Game, we follow Sunggyun as he progresses through a series of absurd, deadly games in

100
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:56,920
an effort to win enough money to put all of his worldly obligations, fears, and trauma

101
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
to rest.

102
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,920
But ah ah ah, the journey to this cash prize brings with it a whole new catalog of obligations,

103
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:15,120
fears, and trauma, which tragically scar him and arguably only make his life worse.

104
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,680
In a lot of ways, it's a much less grounded show.

105
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Like obviously you can compare these two shots and see that.

106
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,120
But I actually want to delve a little bit deeper here and ask you to really think just

107
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,960
how grounded or realistic it is for a street in Philadelphia to have absolutely zero activity

108
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,240
outside of our main character.

109
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,160
Like why are there no cars parked here?

110
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,600
For me, it's because Rocky is framing its story as this one man rising above.

111
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,600
He's not being supported by a community, he's hyper-atomized from others.

112
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,440
But he makes it big, and he's happy, so shut the f*** about it, right?

113
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,920
Rocky is trying to tell this rugged individual narrative, and to do so it brings in some

114
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,200
completely unrealistic elements to drive that point home.

115
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,860
Like this fight right here.

116
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,080
This looks more like a WWE fight than a boxing match.

117
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,120
And that's what stories do.

118
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,360
They try to give you some distance from reality so that you can easily engage with the story

119
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,400
itself and its themes.

120
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,960
So when you're making art that is trying to really engage with harder hitting anti-status

121
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:33,340
quo ideas, ideas that some people would consider dangerous, it's often more effective to write

122
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,780
up a more fantastical setting so that the distance is large enough for the viewers to

123
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,560
safely engage with those themes.

124
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,860
Take the Avatar films for example.

125
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,520
Obviously, Avatar is trying to make some commentaries on Native American genocide and capitalism's

126
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,780
destruction of natural beauty.

127
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,340
But in James Cameron's case, it was a lot more conducive to construct this allegorical

128
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,500
world of Pandora and the Navi than it was to try and write a period piece.

129
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,100
How are you going to make a tasteful action scene this sick if it's limited by historical

130
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,460
accuracy and cultural sensitivity?

131
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,580
You can't.

132
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,140
By exaggerating certain elements or taking them to their extreme conclusion, media can

133
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,580
draw attention to underlying issues that might otherwise be overlooked or taken for granted.

134
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,420
Put another way, visual metaphors are an effective way of communicating complex ideas.

135
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,520
With Squid Game, you see an exaggeration of Rocky, right?

136
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,780
You see these people killing each other, rather than just beating one another senseless.

137
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:43,900
You see these disgusting, degenerate rich people paying to see murder for their own entertainment.

138
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:50,340
Contrast that with the folks at home, cheering them on, merely enjoying a sporting spectacle.

139
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,220
Squid Game has to be a little bit larger than life because it's making a legitimate criticism

140
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,780
of these systems of poverty rather than just telling you a rags to riches story.

141
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,900
It's trying to point out that everything outside of the game is, by and large, just

142
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,540
as arbitrary as the game itself.

143
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:15,660
That the powerlessness of being literally murdered for losing a game of tug of war is

144
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,620
not dissimilar to the powerlessness of being unable to pay for your mother's surgery.

145
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:27,860
But to really nail those points home, Squid Game actually chooses to be much more grounded

146
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,500
in realistic human behaviors than Rocky.

147
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,820
Throughout Squid Game, there is a much greater emphasis on the desperation and debilitating

148
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,340
stress of poverty than there ever is in Rocky.

149
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,260
After the very first game, wherein more than half of the original contestants are killed,

150
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,140
the survivors narrowly vote to end the games and go home.

151
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
That's it.

152
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,420
This second episode, and these people are already done with the eponymous Squid Game,

153
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,060
they just saw hundreds of people murdered in front of them and they want to get out

154
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,140
of there.

155
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,900
And this is where the show is really at its best.

156
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,420
Because in a series of vignettes, we see all of our characters return to their home lives

157
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,340
a bit shaken up, but nevertheless palpably grateful to be free.

158
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:23,660
That is, until the reality of their situations set in, until they are all of them reminded

159
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,340
of the inherent brutality of their everyday lives.

160
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:36,300
In the second episode, so aptly named Hell, the show puts in the work to make clear that

161
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,460
every single day is a struggle.

162
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:47,380
That poverty never gives you a moment's rest, and that no matter how much you love your

163
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:55,020
friends and family, or how much potential you have, poverty simply prevents joy.

164
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,900
So we watch as nearly every survivor of the first match reluctantly decides to return.

165
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,980
We understand why they choose to subject themselves to the arena.

166
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,460
But they never really had a choice to begin with.

167
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,300
I think that Squid Game creator Huang Donghuk's personal experience with poverty really bleeds

168
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,940
through the script, because it reads very true.

169
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,820
In fact, while he was writing Squid Game itself, he was so poor that he had to sell

170
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,860
the computer he wrote it on, just to afford rent.

171
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,340
Which is genuinely tragic.

172
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,580
Because of systemic inequality, we very nearly did not have this really excellent piece of

173
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,140
media at all.

174
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,220
And this man almost went through life with his talent and hard work unrecognized and

175
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,580
unrewarded.

176
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,300
So maybe that's why he had the wherewithal to create this show, right?

177
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,540
Maybe he could never have made a Rocky, because he knows what it's really like to live on

178
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,700
the brink.

179
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:03,020
Even though he himself was able to seize his opportunity to escape poverty, just like Rocky,

180
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,940
he knows that that's not really what life is like.

181
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,180
Did you know that Sylvester Stallone actually had to sell his dog while he was running Rocky?

182
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:19,620
Yeah, he was so poor that he couldn't afford dog food, so he sold his dog for $50.

183
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,780
Just like Huang.

184
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,660
To me, actually, that sounds even more desperate.

185
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,620
Wouldn't you agree, dear viewer?

186
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,540
And yeah, like Huang, luckily he ended up selling the script to make Rocky, so he didn't have

187
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,300
to suffer through those terrible circumstances forever.

188
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,060
And rest assured, the first thing he did with that money is buy Buck his back for a whopping

189
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
$3,000.

190
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,940
Yes, that is right, folks.

191
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,300
He used his own real dog in the movie.

192
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,180
This man named his dog Butt Kiss in IRL.

193
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,460
But what's the damn disconnect, right?

194
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,820
If Stallone struggled just as hard as Huang, why are the products of those struggles so

195
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
different?

196
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,580
Well, I can't speak to the hearts of these two men, but I think Sylvester Stallone was

197
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:13,380
perfectly capable of writing a harder hitting, truer story than Rocky.

198
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,700
But that simply wasn't the cultural zeitgeist of the time in the way that it is today.

199
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,060
Now I don't want to pretend that anti-capitalist themes are like a totally new phenomenon

200
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,620
in media, nor that they are newly popular.

201
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:35,140
Obviously, Fight Club, Wally, and The Matrix all exist, and they were all enormously successful,

202
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,100
along with being coherent criticisms of capitalism.

203
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:53,500
With the exception of Fight Club.

204
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,940
So maybe you could say this trend isn't actually all that new.

205
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,060
But it's definitely the case that people are more willing to engage with seriously revolutionary

206
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,100
ideas now than they were 10 years ago.

207
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,380
And here's my hot take.

208
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,620
I think that is largely because of the attention account, and more specifically the manner in

209
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,740
which capital C content is created within it.

210
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,300
In fact, I go as far as to say that this cultural shift against capitalism is the inevitable

211
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,100
result of living within this media environment.

212
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,500
Now, I recognize that that is a pretty significant claim to make.

213
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,460
But not to worry, I will match it with pretty significant argumentation.

214
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,580
Consider the following as context.

215
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:43,940
Virtually everyone has phones which can access like every interesting thing ever all of the

216
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
time.

217
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:51,100
And those phones also allow you to easily create your own content and share anything you find

218
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,900
interesting to pretty much everyone you know through social media.

219
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,820
That represents an enormous shift in the media landscape.

220
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,460
We can now consume magnitudes more media than ever before, and we do.

221
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,660
Here are a couple of statistics for you.

222
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,540
According to Statista, consumption of digital media in America has almost doubled in the

223
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,980
last 10 years, and it has increased every single year since they started recording.

224
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,820
Now let's take a look at YouTube's growth.

225
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:28,780
Back in 2009, YouTube had about 24 hours of content uploaded to it every minute, which

226
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:35,460
is a lot, 1,440 times as much content as time itself.

227
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Now that number is over 500 hours.

228
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Every minute.

229
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,260
Golly, that's why you guys need to like and subscribe at this moment.

230
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,940
Right a friggin' comment while you're down there too, I mean, guy like me.

231
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,180
But I knew, one last stat for you, lest you think this increased media consumption is

232
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,020
just thanks to the proliferation of smartphones.

233
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:03,620
The number of scripted TV shows produced in the United States has increased from 288 shows

234
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,020
in 2012 to 599 in 2022.

235
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:16,260
And that has also increased every year, with the exception of 2020 because of COVID lockdowns.

236
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,140
Point being, there's way more stuff to watch than ever before.

237
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,420
In the past, people had TVs, and TVs had cable.

238
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,060
The networks chose what to air and when, which forced the consumer to more or less wade through

239
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,780
all the crap to find the stuff they liked.

240
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,220
But now, we use streaming services and social media, which show you whatever you want whenever

241
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
you want it.

242
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,780
To keep track of all that, those platforms have algorithms.

243
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,260
Whenever we're watching something, we're doing so under the watchful eye of an algorithm

244
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,500
that tries to find patterns in what we do and don't like, and synthesize that information

245
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,820
so that it can wade through all the crap for us.

246
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,940
Though they do still leave a whole lot to be desired in that regard.

247
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,700
But regardless, they're trying to personalize our media consumption in order to keep us

248
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,380
using their platform.

249
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,500
And that's created a happy little accident.

250
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,140
It is now much easier for creators to find an audience for media that might not have

251
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,060
been considered viable 10 or 15 years ago.

252
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,020
Like live streaming, obviously, did not exist.

253
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,220
And that's huge.

254
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,060
The video essay community, that didn't exist, and that's not quite as huge.

255
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:32,860
But as it pertains to this video, with algorithms driving content recommendations, there is

256
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,980
a much greater willingness for producers to green light TV shows and movies that tackle

257
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,500
difficult subjects and feature marginalized voices.

258
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,620
For example, take my personal favorite, Bojack Horseman.

259
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:53,260
An adult animation serial centered on tackling extremely serious mental health challenges

260
00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:00,020
while walking the tightrope of keeping that funny is a difficult pitch.

261
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,180
There were not really a lot of examples you could have compared it to when it was released.

262
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,660
And even being charitable, it's not something you'd think would have mass appeal in the

263
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,620
same way that a traditional sitcom would.

264
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,580
You could maybe argue that the brass over an adult swim would have given it a chance

265
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,540
since it is silly comedy.

266
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:23,220
But it never would have been the runaway success that it was had it not been in Netflix original.

267
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,780
Or take Orange as the new black.

268
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,420
An absolutely groundbreaking series.

269
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,980
How many cable TV shows in 2013 featured in almost exclusively female cast?

270
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,020
Let alone prominently feature a transgender black woman in their cast.

271
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,820
There's just not a single TV channel at that time who would have greenlit that script with

272
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,220
such frank discussions of gender, race, and sexuality.

273
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,500
And it is thanks to the successes of shows like Orange the new black that marginalized

274
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,140
voices are finally being heard in mainstream TV and film.

275
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,300
That's probably the most critical change that the attention economy has ushered in.

276
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:10,020
There is now a plethora of content being produced by voices from marginalized communities.

277
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,140
And that content is being pushed just as seriously as anything else on the platforms.

278
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,900
And now, I'm not trying to get too sentimental here, the prominence of such content is not

279
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,460
because we've conquered racism or sexism or any of the isms.

280
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:30,260
It's because streaming services, social media, and algorithms have afforded us the personalization

281
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,340
technology necessary to get that content out to marginalized people.

282
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,700
Which is all to say the capitalist class has finally realized that marginalized people

283
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,060
are still a marketable demographic.

284
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,660
However, within that there is another happy accident.

285
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,740
Amplifying marginalized voices expose a lot of unmarginalized people to their perspectives

286
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,580
and made them realize that, hey, maybe this is all a touch unfair.

287
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Couple that with the digital activism that comes with social media and the real, unbelievable

288
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,820
growth of wealth inequality in the same time frame.

289
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,820
And it's easy to see why everyone's fiddling around with the idea of replacing capitalism.

290
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,500
Or at least cis-hatero-patriarchal white supremacist capitalism.

291
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,340
God knows we gave it a good go, but I think the contradictions inherent to all of those

292
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,580
systems are becoming overwhelmingly clear.

293
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:35,180
I think everyone is painfully aware that a lot of the ways our society works don't actually

294
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,180
work.

295
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,820
We are slapped in the face by the very visible inefficiencies of a system in which there are

296
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,940
hundreds of thousands of homeless people, yet there are tens of millions of empty homes.

297
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,380
Like over 30 empty houses per homeless person, 30.

298
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,740
And while everyone is keenly aware of those problems, we are also equally aware of the

299
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,340
shortcomings of non-capitalist societies.

300
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,740
I for one don't feel comfortable supporting pretty much any contemporary political systems

301
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,380
that are currently labeling themselves as socialists, and a lot of people don't really

302
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,620
feel comfortable broadly supporting socialism or capitalism.

303
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,220
These movies play into that.

304
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,660
For the most part, they don't deal with trying to present an alternative.

305
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,580
The media just lays out the relatable criticisms and leaves it at that, which makes them really

306
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,380
easy to support.

307
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,740
That's why no one can ever understand the endings of these movies, by the way.

308
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,740
It's because they're deliberately vague.

309
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,700
They don't want to take a stand and tell you to actually revolt, so they kind of just fizzle

310
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,780
out at the end.

311
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,900
Like when you're watching Parasite, you feel in your body that there is some kind of natural

312
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,340
progression there.

313
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,620
So when there's not riots in the street at the end, you're like, huh?

314
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,740
Is there something I missed?

315
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,380
So that's my theory.

316
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,580
Everyone suddenly loves these anti-capitalist narratives because they're an easy way to

317
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:08,020
engage with the idea of disliking capitalism without really having to reconcile with the

318
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,860
difficulties of taking political action.

319
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,980
And the reason this phenomenon has become so visible is that the attention economy has

320
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,780
finally given marginalized people the chance to get their stories out there in ways that

321
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,900
were simply not possible in the past.

322
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,340
And that, again, we are currently living through a second gildedage.

323
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,500
Like this is only comparable to that time we let dudes get rich enough to make houses

324
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,020
that have their own fucking Wikipedia pages.

325
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,740
There is a Wikipedia page to list the individual Wikipedia pages of the houses owned by this

326
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,620
one dude, whomst was less rich than Bezos.

327
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,020
That's how many ridiculous fuck off mansions he had.

328
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,420
Just keep that in your back pocket.

329
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,860
And if you're one of those people that is reconciling with the idea that capitalism

330
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,180
is terrible and you're still on the fence, I urge you to take a chance.

331
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Just because there's nothing that I can currently point to for us to emulate does not mean we

332
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,140
don't have the tools necessary to make something special.

333
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,660
A lot of people have thought very hard about how we can improve society and they've spent

334
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,340
a lot of time practicing those ideas.

335
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,140
I'm pretty comfortable saying the solutions are there.

336
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,260
Literally just to unionize your workplace.

337
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,340
It's not as hard as you think, but please let me know what your take is.

338
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,780
Maybe you think this trend is simply capital exerting a further grip on the zeitgeist by

339
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,020
commoditizing their resistance.

340
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,260
Maybe you think this has nothing to do with the proliferation of smartphones at all.

341
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,460
Let me know if you think I'm wrong, or if I just missed something.

342
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,820
I'm genuinely interested in hearing people's thoughts on the subject.

343
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,060
If you're still here, I would really appreciate it if you would take the time to like, comment

344
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
and subscribe.

345
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,100
And if you're really amazing, share this with your pals.

346
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Regardless, thank you again for watching and hopefully I'll see you next time.
