0	5000	Kapuni Uriah Plant in southern Taranaki has observed several milestones recently.
5000	10000	It began as one of Prime Minister Rob Muldoon's think-big projects 30 years ago.
10000	14000	For the past 20 years, balanced agri-nutrients has owned the operation
14000	18000	and recently it's invested $30 million in capital improvements
18000	23000	and secured gas supply and resource consents to ensure operation for the next two decades.
23000	28000	In December of 2012 we celebrated 30 years of operation.
28000	33000	Prior to Kapuni, all nitrogen, all Uriah was imported into New Zealand.
33000	40000	Having said that, 30 years ago the demand for Uriah was not what the demand for Uriah is today.
40000	46000	Now there's about 600,000 tonnes of Uriah used in the agricultural sector alone.
46000	54000	We are deemed an energy intensive industry and an industry which is under threat from imported product as well.
54000	58000	We are consented to operate on our site.
58000	64000	That consent covers both our nitrogen waste, our water abstraction, our emissions to atmosphere.
64000	68000	And we have consents in place through to 2035.
68000	73000	In terms of bigger picture environmental consent, we also surrender carbon units
73000	80000	for all the natural gas that we consume on site, both as fuel and as processed gas.
80000	83000	The Uriah manufacturing process starts with natural gas.
83000	92000	Natural gas is a raw material of which we reform to separate into hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
92000	95000	Really the process is one of purification.
95000	99000	We try and get those hydrogen streams, the CO2 streams as pure as we possibly can
99000	105000	before combining the hydrogen and nitrogen which we suck out of the air in the ammonia synthesis loop.
105000	108000	That ammonia is like an intermediary product.
108000	113000	Once we've got the ammonia, we combine that with the CO2 that we removed at the reformer.
113000	116000	When you put it back together, it reacts really strongly.
116000	119000	It's a really exothermic reaction, releasing lots of heat.
119000	122000	And at that point you've got an impure Uriah mixture.
122000	126000	And the rest of the Uriah plant processes about purifying that Uriah
126000	131000	and then turning it from a liquid product into a granular product.
131000	134000	There's two types of gas that arrives on site.
134000	137000	One is fuel gas and one is processed gas.
137000	139000	Composition and make-up, they're exactly the same.
139000	141000	It's just how we use them.
141000	145000	So the processed gases are the building blocks of what we're going to make the Uriah from.
145000	153000	We need the carbon that's in the natural gas and we need the hydrogen that is in the natural gas, i.e. as methane.
153000	157000	The fuel gas we're simply using as an energy source, our heat source,
157000	161000	and to drive some of our big engines on site.
161000	166000	The liquid Uriah is then sprayed onto seed Uriah.
166000	169000	So seed is very small particles of Uriah.
169000	176000	And as that liquid Uriah is sprayed up onto them, those seeds grow larger and larger and larger through about nine spray stages.
176000	181000	The first time that we actually get to see the physical product that we're going to make is at the end of the granulator.
181000	186000	And at the end of the granulator we can get a bit of a gauge on the size of the product that we're making.
186000	194000	Usually from the granulator we get quite a wide size distribution and then through sieving and crushing and sorting,
194000	202000	we get the size distribution tighter and tighter so that we get a consistent product which is going to end up with our spreaders
202000	207000	or end up with our industrial customers.
207000	211000	Product sampling is critical to ensuring that the product that we put out,
211000	216000	is going to make Uriah for agricultural use, Uriah for industrial use,
216000	219000	or Uriah for using the GoClear diesel additive.
219000	229000	We've got to make sure that the different impurities in the process are managed and always controlled within our tolerance limits.
229000	236000	At the end of the day we end up with 260,000 tonnes every year of this granular Uriah.
236000	244000	We're catching this product in bulk and in bulk trucks, 30 tonne payloads and 20 kg bags, 40 kg bags,
244000	247000	one tonne bags and half tonne bags.
252000	256000	This program was made with funding from New Zealand On Air.
