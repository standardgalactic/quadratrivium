00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Kapuni Uriah Plant in southern Taranaki has observed several milestones recently.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It began as one of Prime Minister Rob Muldoon's think-big projects 30 years ago.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
For the past 20 years, balanced agri-nutrients has owned the operation

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and recently it's invested $30 million in capital improvements

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and secured gas supply and resource consents to ensure operation for the next two decades.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In December of 2012 we celebrated 30 years of operation.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Prior to Kapuni, all nitrogen, all Uriah was imported into New Zealand.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Having said that, 30 years ago the demand for Uriah was not what the demand for Uriah is today.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now there's about 600,000 tonnes of Uriah used in the agricultural sector alone.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We are deemed an energy intensive industry and an industry which is under threat from imported product as well.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We are consented to operate on our site.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That consent covers both our nitrogen waste, our water abstraction, our emissions to atmosphere.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And we have consents in place through to 2035.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In terms of bigger picture environmental consent, we also surrender carbon units

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
for all the natural gas that we consume on site, both as fuel and as processed gas.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The Uriah manufacturing process starts with natural gas.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Natural gas is a raw material of which we reform to separate into hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Really the process is one of purification.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We try and get those hydrogen streams, the CO2 streams as pure as we possibly can

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
before combining the hydrogen and nitrogen which we suck out of the air in the ammonia synthesis loop.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That ammonia is like an intermediary product.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Once we've got the ammonia, we combine that with the CO2 that we removed at the reformer.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When you put it back together, it reacts really strongly.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a really exothermic reaction, releasing lots of heat.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And at that point you've got an impure Uriah mixture.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the rest of the Uriah plant processes about purifying that Uriah

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and then turning it from a liquid product into a granular product.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There's two types of gas that arrives on site.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
One is fuel gas and one is processed gas.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Composition and make-up, they're exactly the same.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's just how we use them.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So the processed gases are the building blocks of what we're going to make the Uriah from.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We need the carbon that's in the natural gas and we need the hydrogen that is in the natural gas, i.e. as methane.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The fuel gas we're simply using as an energy source, our heat source,

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and to drive some of our big engines on site.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The liquid Uriah is then sprayed onto seed Uriah.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So seed is very small particles of Uriah.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And as that liquid Uriah is sprayed up onto them, those seeds grow larger and larger and larger through about nine spray stages.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The first time that we actually get to see the physical product that we're going to make is at the end of the granulator.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And at the end of the granulator we can get a bit of a gauge on the size of the product that we're making.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Usually from the granulator we get quite a wide size distribution and then through sieving and crushing and sorting,

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we get the size distribution tighter and tighter so that we get a consistent product which is going to end up with our spreaders

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
or end up with our industrial customers.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Product sampling is critical to ensuring that the product that we put out,

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is going to make Uriah for agricultural use, Uriah for industrial use,

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
or Uriah for using the GoClear diesel additive.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We've got to make sure that the different impurities in the process are managed and always controlled within our tolerance limits.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
At the end of the day we end up with 260,000 tonnes every year of this granular Uriah.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We're catching this product in bulk and in bulk trucks, 30 tonne payloads and 20 kg bags, 40 kg bags,

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
one tonne bags and half tonne bags.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This program was made with funding from New Zealand On Air.
