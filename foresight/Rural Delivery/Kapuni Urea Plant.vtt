Kapuni Uriah Plant in southern Taranaki has observed several milestones recently.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
It began as one of Prime Minister Rob Muldoon's think-big projects 30 years ago.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
For the past 20 years, balanced agri-nutrients has owned the operation

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
and recently it's invested $30 million in capital improvements

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
and secured gas supply and resource consents to ensure operation for the next two decades.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
In December of 2012 we celebrated 30 years of operation.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Prior to Kapuni, all nitrogen, all Uriah was imported into New Zealand.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Having said that, 30 years ago the demand for Uriah was not what the demand for Uriah is today.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Now there's about 600,000 tonnes of Uriah used in the agricultural sector alone.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
We are deemed an energy intensive industry and an industry which is under threat from imported product as well.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
We are consented to operate on our site.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
That consent covers both our nitrogen waste, our water abstraction, our emissions to atmosphere.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
And we have consents in place through to 2035.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
In terms of bigger picture environmental consent, we also surrender carbon units

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
for all the natural gas that we consume on site, both as fuel and as processed gas.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
The Uriah manufacturing process starts with natural gas.

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
Natural gas is a raw material of which we reform to separate into hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Really the process is one of purification.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
We try and get those hydrogen streams, the CO2 streams as pure as we possibly can

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
before combining the hydrogen and nitrogen which we suck out of the air in the ammonia synthesis loop.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
That ammonia is like an intermediary product.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Once we've got the ammonia, we combine that with the CO2 that we removed at the reformer.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
When you put it back together, it reacts really strongly.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
It's a really exothermic reaction, releasing lots of heat.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
And at that point you've got an impure Uriah mixture.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And the rest of the Uriah plant processes about purifying that Uriah

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
and then turning it from a liquid product into a granular product.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
There's two types of gas that arrives on site.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
One is fuel gas and one is processed gas.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Composition and make-up, they're exactly the same.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
It's just how we use them.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
So the processed gases are the building blocks of what we're going to make the Uriah from.

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
We need the carbon that's in the natural gas and we need the hydrogen that is in the natural gas, i.e. as methane.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
The fuel gas we're simply using as an energy source, our heat source,

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
and to drive some of our big engines on site.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
The liquid Uriah is then sprayed onto seed Uriah.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So seed is very small particles of Uriah.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
And as that liquid Uriah is sprayed up onto them, those seeds grow larger and larger and larger through about nine spray stages.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
The first time that we actually get to see the physical product that we're going to make is at the end of the granulator.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
And at the end of the granulator we can get a bit of a gauge on the size of the product that we're making.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
Usually from the granulator we get quite a wide size distribution and then through sieving and crushing and sorting,

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
we get the size distribution tighter and tighter so that we get a consistent product which is going to end up with our spreaders

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
or end up with our industrial customers.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Product sampling is critical to ensuring that the product that we put out,

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
is going to make Uriah for agricultural use, Uriah for industrial use,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
or Uriah for using the GoClear diesel additive.

03:39.000 --> 03:49.000
We've got to make sure that the different impurities in the process are managed and always controlled within our tolerance limits.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
At the end of the day we end up with 260,000 tonnes every year of this granular Uriah.

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
We're catching this product in bulk and in bulk trucks, 30 tonne payloads and 20 kg bags, 40 kg bags,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
one tonne bags and half tonne bags.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
This program was made with funding from New Zealand On Air.
