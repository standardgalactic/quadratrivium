Checking Rural Delivery/Kapuni Urea Plant.txt
 The Kapuni Uriah Plant in southern Taranaki has celebrated its 30th anniversary of operation and has undergone significant investment and development over the past two decades. Originally conceived as a think-big project by Prime Minister Rob Muldoon, the plant has been operated by Balanced Agri-Nutrients for 20 years and has recently invested $30 million in capital improvements to ensure its operation for at least the next two decades. The plant is crucial for New Zealand's agricultural sector, which uses approximately 600,000 tonnes of Uriah (urea) annually.

The plant is energy-intensive and relies on natural gas as a raw material. It undergoes a purification process where hydrogen and carbon dioxide are separated from the natural gas. The hydrogen and nitrogen, sourced from the air, are then combined in an exothermic reaction to produce ammonia. This ammonia is further processed with CO2 to create Uriah.

The plant operates with consents that cover its emissions, water abstraction, and nitrogen waste management, which are in place until 2035. It also compensates for its carbon emissions by surrendering carbon units for the natural gas consumed on-site.

The Uriah manufacturing process involves several stages: reforming natural gas into hydrogen and CO2, synthesizing ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen, reacting ammonia with CO2 to produce Uriah, and then purifying and granulating the Uriah into a consistent product for use in agriculture and industry.

The plant receives two types of natural gas: processed gas for Uriah production and fuel gas for energy and power needs. The produced Uriah is then granulated and packaged in various sizes, from bulk trucks to small bags, totaling around 260,000 tonnes per year.

The plant's operation and product quality are closely monitored through regular sampling and testing to ensure the Uriah meets the necessary standards for agricultural use, including its application as a GoClear diesel additive. The investment in capital improvements, resource consents, and ongoing operational excellence underscores the plant's commitment to sustaining its role in New Zealand's agricultural industry.
