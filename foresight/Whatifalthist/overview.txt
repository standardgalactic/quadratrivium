1. Christianity is currently facing a decline in attendance among young men due to its perceived lack of masculinity, but there's a push to make it more masculine and relevant again. If Christianity adapts effectively, it has the potential to rebound and remain influential, as it has shown historical resilience and adaptability.

2. The declining birth rates among the non-religious suggest that religious individuals, particularly those who are educated, will become an increasingly significant proportion of the population in the future. This could lead to a resurgence of religion in society.

3. Christianity is viewed as having a better track record than other world religions or ideologies like fascism, communism, and extreme individualism in terms of providing individuals with mental models that aid in life management.

4. While Darwinism and Marxism are currently influential, their combination is problematic due to the inherent contradictions between evolutionary science and Marxist ideology. The left's disregard for logical inconsistencies within its worldview is noted.

5. A future where Christianity becomes a state religion again could lead to a new form of Christianity that is unrecognizable by today's standards, potentially incorporating advanced spiritual technology or other adaptations.

6. The outcome of this ideological competition is not predetermined; it depends on how these ideas evolve and are adopted by individuals. The future of religion and ideology is still being shaped by current events and the choices made by people like us.

In conclusion, Christianity has a strong historical precedent for resilience and adaptability, which could lead to its revival if it continues to evolve and meet the needs of modern society. The next form of Christianity or a completely new religious ideology could emerge as a significant force in the world, shaped by both internal and external factors. The future is not set, and the role each individual plays in this evolutionary process can be pivotal.
