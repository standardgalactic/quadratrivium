0	10000	Now, so I'm going to talk about EGI.
10000	13000	I've got long, I've got lots of slides, so I'll move very quickly.
13000	16000	Here's a report I wrote for Riley.
16000	22000	There's a company I started as an AI consulting company.
22000	24000	And so what are we going to talk about?
24000	28000	So the first question we have to ask, and I apologize if you've seen this talk before,
28000	32000	I had given it a few times, hopefully there's none in the room who has.
32000	38000	What is intelligence and then what physical systems are available for us to get inspiration from
38000	42000	and how far have we come in building the hardware.
42000	47000	And then I'm going to look at very briefly deep learning as, you know,
47000	51000	just ask very quickly the question, are we on the right track?
51000	55000	And then with deep learning, is that going to get us all the way to EGI?
55000	58000	The answer is no, spoiler.
58000	60000	And so what do we need, what's missing?
60000	63000	I'll do a very quick overview at the end.
63000	67000	And we'll look at one particular, one theory in particular called active inference.
67000	73000	And amongst a whole, you know, zoo of theories, really, EGI theories.
73000	75000	We'll pick that one out, I'll explain why.
75000	78000	And then I'll wrap it up with conclusions.
78000	80000	So, you know, why do we want to build it?
80000	82000	Well, it's kind of obvious, right?
82000	87000	We want to build it to solve the problem of the century, probably,
87000	91000	of the human race, maybe, arguably, so I might argue.
91000	96000	And then, you know, to make lots of money doing it, but really it's just to solve it.
96000	100000	And see, and then once we solve it, as DeepMind said, we can use it to solve everything else.
100000	106000	That includes all science or medicine, how to live longer, how to be alive,
106000	111000	new materials, you name it, you know, spacecraft, explore the galaxies, use your imagination.
111000	113000	So that really is the aim, right?
113000	117000	To build general level intelligence and quite quickly, you know,
117000	121000	move beyond that to superintelligence.
121000	124000	So, you know, a quick question I always ask the audience.
124000	126000	Are any of these general intelligence?
126000	130000	So we've got Watson there, Super Impressive, you know,
130000	135000	we've got the chess playing Deep Blue, IBM, Alpha Star, just very recently,
135000	140000	you know, DeepMind built that system that could beat some of the best players at Starcraft.
141000	144000	And online game and AlphaGo.
144000	149000	So, no, no matter how impressive all of these are, and they certainly were,
149000	154000	you know, years into making 10, 20, 30 years since the birth of AI, maybe,
154000	158000	they're not, they're nothing to do with AI.
158000	163000	So, and here's why, because intelligence is much broader than that.
163000	165000	Remember, we asked the question, what is intelligence?
165000	170000	Well, a guy called Howard Gardner at Harvard, I think in the 90s,
170000	173000	wrote down quite a nice way of categorizing it.
173000	176000	So you put it into nine categories.
176000	180000	So we've got naturalist understanding nature, the external world, can go do that, no.
180000	184000	You know, and I want to keep going, can go do that, can go do that.
184000	186000	The answer is no, no, no.
186000	188000	The spatial visualization.
188000	193000	So we have AI, you know, that can do maybe one of these really well,
193000	195000	but never more than two, right?
195000	197000	So we're nowhere near AI.
197000	204000	Intrapersonal introspection, you know, there's a TPU sitting in a Google Data Center.
204000	207000	No matter what algorithm you run on it, it doesn't go, why am I here?
207000	209000	Right, why am I a TPU who made me?
209000	211000	Right, no.
211000	213000	This is all part of intelligence.
213000	215000	Introspection, even though I make light of it, is, you know,
215000	218000	a very important aspect of intelligence.
218000	221000	Language, linguistics, we have NLP.
221000	226000	We can have things that read and classify sentences.
226000	229000	And, you know, are they created?
229000	235000	It's mostly based on statistical analysis of words and images and pixels and whatnot.
235000	239000	It's not quite how the brain does it, or the biological brain.
239000	241000	We have movement.
241000	244000	You know, the best assets in the world get paid, you know,
244000	248000	all players getting transferred for 100, 200 million pounds, right?
248000	250000	I mean, there's some of the highest-paid people in the world,
250000	252000	because they use their body so well.
252000	256000	The basketball players in America, the football players in Europe.
256000	258000	So that's a part of intelligence.
258000	260000	And, you know, we have robotics, right?
260000	264000	So there's nowhere, we haven't got any robots that can play football like Nestle,
264000	267000	or, you know, the Beth, Michael Jordan, and muscle balls.
267000	268000	They work very close.
268000	271000	Although, you know, impressive progress has been made with that.
271000	273000	You see it being backflips and whatnot.
273000	275000	Super impressive, right?
275000	278000	It's quite general, even that one small limit of sense.
278000	281000	Interpersonal, how we communicate with each other in the world.
281000	283000	Animals, ourselves.
283000	287000	Interpersonal, communications, modeling what the other person is thinking, right?
287000	290000	And then predicting what their next move will be.
290000	292000	Now, we know that.
292000	293000	It's essential.
293000	294000	That's the way we hear it.
294000	297000	And the logical mathematical path that we've kind of got.
297000	300000	I would argue, you know, fight with it, chess, and go,
300000	302000	and numerical stuff and calculate it.
302000	304000	It's a very simple calculator.
304000	307000	So we probably were okay in that quadrant.
307000	312000	And then musical and other creative art music, writing poems, just, you know,
312000	316000	but mostly musical, you know, writing would be linguistic.
316000	320000	So art, the creative fine arts.
320000	325000	Yeah, you know, AI, narrow AI has written some songs,
325000	328000	but, you know, use the word written very loosely.
328000	331000	You know, one could argue again, it's statistical, not creative.
331000	333000	So what are we missing?
333000	336000	So, you know, how far have we come?
336000	340000	Well, like, the highest is probably logical mathematical at 50%.
340000	343000	So calculation is great, but not creativity.
343000	348000	You know, they can't really invent new games of go or new types of math yet.
348000	349000	Okay.
349000	354000	You know, there's mathematicians in the world, the guys who gets the field there that we haven't,
354000	357000	they can't, you know, do math at the level of the field there,
357000	359000	that's sort of a Nobel Prize winner.
359000	362000	And linguistic is good as they are.
362000	365000	It's in creating stuff and complete sentence,
365000	368000	completion and, you know, sentiment analysis.
368000	370000	It's a statistical analysis.
370000	372000	It's not what we're doing.
372000	374000	It's not a creative thing.
374000	377000	And then I don't know how to read the list, right?
377000	381000	Spatial, we've got the span and body, you've got atlas.
381000	386000	You know, in understanding the environment, I thought 10%, that's a generous 10% music,
386000	389000	you know, Google, the Gentile, 50%.
389000	391000	These are all pretty generous numbers, I would say.
391000	394000	So basically, you know, we know we need a general intelligence.
394000	397000	We're not at 100%, but we can do all of these really well.
397000	401000	You know, we specialize in what we pick, what we put out and specialize,
401000	403000	but we can do them all.
403000	407000	So it takes a village to, you know, raise a child,
407000	409000	and it's going to take a village to create AGI.
409000	411000	So we're going to need computer science.
411000	414000	That's the one that everybody's got right now,
414000	417000	but also going to need physics, we're going to need neuroscience,
417000	419000	and we're going to need psychology.
419000	421000	We're going to need people from all walks of life,
421000	424000	because that word general means general, right?
424000	426000	It's everything.
426000	432000	And so let's move on now to the hardware.
432000	434000	You know, how far we've got with the hardware.
434000	439000	Then we'll look at the algorithms and we'll put it all together at the end.
439000	443000	So we basically look at, you know, we have an existence proof.
443000	444000	That's us.
444000	447000	You know, that's a three pound of wet flesh in ourselves.
447000	450000	That's what's creating this general intelligence,
450000	452000	unless you believe in something else.
452000	455000	But, you know, neuroscience, physics tells us that it's all we have.
455000	459000	So we need to get, we are getting inspiration.
459000	462000	Maybe not enough, actually, but this is where it's the first place.
462000	466000	You know, I would probably start looking at how nature builds intelligence,
466000	468000	or how nature hits built intelligence,
468000	470000	even though it's had a little bit of a hit start on us,
470000	472000	like four billion years.
472000	474000	You could argue the big bang, 13 billion years.
474000	477000	We've only been doing it for about 50.
477000	481000	But it's come up with this thing up here in our skulls,
481000	483000	that can come up with a general theory of relativity,
483000	486000	play chess, play go, drive a car, go shopping, raise children,
486000	489000	create mathematics, do this,
489000	493000	pay, you know, everything that civilization has done,
493000	495000	you know, there's a little three pound thing up here.
495000	499000	Given there's a lot of us, and, you know, we think we're on our own,
499000	502000	we don't collectively, we know we're near there, are we?
502000	504000	We're honest with ourselves.
504000	506000	So how does nature do it?
506000	510000	Well, you know, you start off with a single cell organism.
510000	514000	This is where the definition of intelligence gets a little bit tricky.
514000	516000	It's like, is that thing intelligent?
516000	518000	It's alive, it's living, it responds to its environment.
518000	522000	I would argue, yes, it stays alive, manages to stay alive
522000	524000	over billions of years even.
524000	528000	Maybe it's more intelligent than us in that respect, the way you see.
528000	530000	And it reproduces.
530000	533000	It doesn't come out, it can't come up with a general theory of relativity.
533000	535000	So in some sense, it has limited intelligence,
535000	536000	but it's still intelligent.
536000	538000	So, you know, what's that doing?
538000	539000	Can we reproduce that?
539000	540000	Let's start there.
540000	542000	That's the C. elegans worm.
542000	544000	It has 100, 302 neurons.
544000	546000	It has a central nervous system.
546000	549000	It's an organism with the simplest nervous system,
549000	552000	CNS, central nervous system, 302 neurons.
552000	554000	We can build that today.
554000	555000	We've got models of that.
555000	557000	So that's sort of where we are.
557000	560000	You know, we have 80 billion, 100 billion neurons.
560000	561000	We're at 300.
561000	563000	So we've got a little road to travel,
563000	566000	but if we can kind of understand how that thing works,
566000	569000	you know, maybe we can extrapolate and scale a little bit.
569000	571000	We can't give ourselves too hard of time.
571000	575000	In the last 10 years, we can model a C. elegans worm.
575000	576000	We have a bumblebee.
576000	578000	That's about a million neurons.
578000	581000	And they can navigate and do little dances
581000	583000	and tell the rest of the bee colony where the hunt,
583000	586000	where the polliners and come back and mate and stay alive.
586000	587000	They're super intelligent.
587000	589000	I would argue they're super intelligent, right?
589000	592000	They cannot come up with the general theory of relativity,
592000	594000	but they're still super smart.
594000	596000	We haven't got that far.
596000	597000	And then there's these things,
597000	599000	the wick mushy bit in our head,
599000	601000	three pounds in our skull.
601000	604000	And we know any of that, even though, you know, it's small, right?
604000	606000	I mean, we're trying to understand the universe,
606000	607000	the cosmos, the galaxy.
607000	609000	We're kind of, you know, doing a better job.
609000	611000	We can't even understand the tiny little thing.
611000	613000	I mean, just, it's not just.
613000	614000	It's very, very clever.
614000	615000	It's had billions of years to evolve.
615000	617000	So, you know, what are we missing?
617000	618000	What's the math?
618000	620000	What's the mathematical model to build something
620000	622000	that can model or come up with math
622000	627000	and model its environment into personal introspection?
627000	629000	How does that happen, right?
629000	630000	That's what we've got to figure out.
630000	631000	It's not it.
631000	632000	It's no small problem.
632000	636000	So, the first thing we notice from biology is it's hierarchical.
636000	639000	It starts off with molecules and neurons cells
639000	641000	and then networks of cells
641000	643000	and then sort of subsections of the brain
643000	646000	or integrated connected together wonderfully
646000	648000	to create a whole brain.
648000	650000	That's a connectome.
650000	653000	And, you know, there's a part doing math.
653000	654000	There's a part doing language.
654000	655000	There's a part doing emotion.
655000	656000	There's a part.
656000	657000	Is there a part that creates music?
657000	659000	Is there another part that drives a car?
659000	661000	Another part that, you know,
661000	663000	or is it all sort of integrated?
663000	665000	You know, so that's the kind of inspiration
665000	666000	we need to take from biology
666000	669000	and kind of use that to build mathematical models
669000	672000	and then actually build it in physical hardware.
672000	673000	Because Simon said,
673000	674000	we don't understand anything in this.
674000	675000	We can build it.
675000	676000	And I quite agree, right?
676000	678000	We can write down any mathematical stuff we like.
678000	680000	There's lots of models,
680000	682000	the public kits, all sorts of different models.
682000	683000	But until we build it,
683000	685000	we don't really understand.
685000	686000	We don't know if it tries.
686000	688000	It's just a few.
688000	689000	Okay.
689000	691000	And then, yeah,
691000	693000	certainly we have societies
693000	695000	which are kind of hierarchical.
695000	698000	We organize ourselves hierarchical in cities
698000	700000	and countries and nations, et cetera.
700000	702000	Right?
702000	703000	Okay.
703000	705000	So this is biology.
705000	707000	Super complicated, super complex, right?
707000	710000	You know, do we have to go down to that level of complexity?
710000	711000	Well, that's a good question.
711000	713000	Or can we just start at the cell in Europe?
713000	716000	That's a bit of an open question right now.
716000	718000	It's good to have open questions
718000	719000	about science.
719000	721000	That's what science is about, okay?
721000	723000	But then it sort of organized itself
723000	726000	into about two million of these cortical columns.
726000	729000	So the brain has some sort of sort of substructure there.
729000	731000	And it's quite common over the whole brain
731000	733000	in the neocortex.
733000	736000	Yeah, the math part, the seeing, the hearing.
736000	738000	So one part of our brain,
738000	741000	if we go blind or whatever through accident,
741000	745000	those cortical columns are used to analyze the sound.
745000	747000	So there's something very fundamental
747000	749000	going on there.
749000	751000	These are all clues.
751000	754000	From biology, there's a connectome,
754000	756000	and there's a central nervous system
756000	758000	that helps all connect together.
758000	760000	Maybe we don't need to build bodies.
760000	762000	You know, if you want robots, we do.
762000	764000	But if we just want something that thinks really well,
764000	766000	create series like Stephen Hawking.
766000	768000	I mean, you can parallelize it to get around.
768000	771000	But I'm just saying that we only need the rest of that
771000	773000	if we want to build a robot, okay?
773000	775000	We're really focused on the neocortex
776000	778000	a bit in the skull.
778000	781000	Okay, and then there's the societal limits.
781000	785000	So what have we built with hardware?
785000	787000	Okay, well, we've come a long way.
787000	790000	We're up to about 10 billion transistors,
790000	791000	and there's different types,
791000	794000	CPU, GPU, the Graphcore, IQ.
794000	796000	And there's different types of,
796000	798000	due to different data sets, basically.
798000	802000	So if you want to understand environmental data,
802000	805000	that's where we probably need something beyond the GPU.
805000	808000	The GPU is really good at matrix modification,
808000	810000	and the brain doesn't do matrix modification
810000	812000	to understand and create, right?
812000	815000	But deep learning does.
815000	818000	So we do need GPUs to that and CPUs.
818000	820000	But if we really need to go beyond
820000	822000	in a different sort of hardware architecture,
822000	825000	if we do want to have general intelligence.
825000	828000	Okay, so there's a little nostalgia here.
828000	831000	That's a cray, over 40 years ago,
831000	834000	160 megaflops, how quaint, you know,
834000	837000	we have teraflops in our pocket now.
837000	840000	So this is where we are today.
840000	842000	We have, you know, with Moore's Law,
842000	845000	we've had a factor of a million or so since then.
845000	847000	So we've got the i9 Intel CPU,
847000	851000	we've got the NVIDIA V100 Volta GPU,
851000	854000	we've got the Google TPU version 3,
854000	856000	which are absolutely pedaflops,
856000	858000	but just beyond the TPU,
858000	862000	coming online is the Graphcore IQ.
862000	865000	But really, these are all matrix multipliers.
865000	867000	So super impressive, you know,
867000	870000	we've got 100 pedaflops in a thing that, you know,
870000	872000	we've put on this stage,
872000	874000	which is somewhat what the brain does.
874000	876000	I think the brain does about a pedaflop or so.
876000	879000	So it's not about raw computation, right?
879000	881000	If it was, we would be there.
881000	883000	This thing would be coming up with theories
883000	885000	of relativity and all sorts of stuff.
885000	887000	We're trying to find physics and creating symphonies,
887000	888000	but it can't.
888000	890000	It's done as a brick, right?
890000	894000	Instead of that, that's exaflops, right?
894000	896000	That's a thousand times a pedaflop.
896000	898000	So we're going to need something more.
898000	901000	What are we missing in the hardware, right?
901000	903000	So it's not just about hardware.
903000	904000	It's actually about the hardware,
904000	906000	which is pretty obvious when you think about it,
906000	909000	because what's up here is a little different
909000	912000	than the hardware we've just seen.
912000	914000	What about neuromorphic computing?
914000	916000	So this is where things get interesting,
916000	921000	because now we're using analog circuits,
921000	922000	which is what the brain is.
922000	924000	The brain uses spiking neural networks,
924000	928000	which is almost a combination of analog and digital.
928000	930000	So there's a guy called Steve Berber,
930000	932000	one of the co-founders of ARM.
932000	935000	After 20 years, he left ARM
935000	937000	in the University of Manchester 20 years ago.
937000	939000	He set up a project called Spinnacle,
939000	941000	which is now being folded into the human brain project.
941000	943000	There's IBM True North.
943000	945000	There's brain scales at the human brain project.
945000	947000	There's various projects throughout the world
947000	950000	building this analog hardware.
950000	955000	So to me, I think this is a big part of it.
955000	957000	Albums are certainly important,
957000	961000	but I think the hardware is important as well.
961000	965000	So Spinnacle, we've got a billion neurons.
965000	968000	So a hundred times that, we've got the human brain.
968000	970000	So we've built a mouse brain already,
970000	972000	and it can do stuff like navigate through mazes
972000	974000	and play Sudoku and do crossword puzzles.
974000	976000	It does intelligent stuff,
976000	978000	and you know, some people have heard of that,
978000	980000	but it does not get depressed, does it?
980000	981000	Deep mind does.
981000	984000	Now, for go, everything else, it doesn't.
984000	986000	I argue that this is part of my thesis
986000	990000	that this is what will take us to general intelligence.
990000	991000	And there it is.
991000	993000	Five racks are up to 10 now.
993000	997000	There it is, sitting in a data center in Manchester,
997000	998000	part of the human brain project,
998000	1001000	and that is neuromorphic computing.
1001000	1002000	There's a billion neurons here.
1002000	1003000	There's a mouse brain right there.
1003000	1005000	It's a little bigger than a mouse brain,
1005000	1006000	but we've seen with Moore's Law,
1006000	1008000	we're quite good at scaling, right?
1008000	1011000	So the point is, we've built some stuff here
1011000	1012000	which might be useful for us.
1012000	1014000	And that's how you scale up.
1014000	1016000	You put 1,000 neurons on a core.
1016000	1018000	You put 18 cores on a chip.
1018000	1019000	You send it away.
1019000	1020000	You get it built.
1020000	1021000	It comes back.
1021000	1022000	You put them together.
1022000	1023000	You put the chips on the board,
1023000	1024000	put boards in a rack,
1024000	1026000	and then you get 10 cabinets,
1026000	1028000	and you put quite racks in each cabinet.
1028000	1031000	You've got 50 servers, neuromorphic servers,
1031000	1033000	and you have a mouse brain.
1033000	1036000	That's how you do it, and it's been done.
1036000	1038000	That is the brain scale approach that I mentioned
1038000	1039000	at the human brain project.
1039000	1042000	That's about the same size as the spinnaker
1042000	1043000	and the same power,
1043000	1044000	got a mouse brain,
1044000	1046000	uses a slightly different architecture.
1046000	1047000	I won't go into the details.
1047000	1049000	True North IBM uses a slightly different architecture,
1049000	1051000	but the point is, you're all neuromorphic,
1051000	1055000	and you're all analog based on spiking your networks.
1055000	1059000	And that's sort of general intelligent mouse level
1059000	1061000	compared to the Google TPUs,
1061000	1064000	which are super impressive at different types of things.
1064000	1066000	I'd argue they won't get us a general intelligence
1066000	1069000	with the thing on the left side.
1069000	1071000	What about quantum?
1071000	1072000	I don't think the brain is quantum.
1072000	1074000	It's too warm and wet.
1074000	1076000	Quantum needs super cold temperatures.
1076000	1078000	It's decoherence very quickly.
1078000	1080000	I don't think there's qubits in the brain,
1080000	1081000	but they look nice.
1081000	1083000	I put a picture of one on there.
1083000	1084000	That's what a quantum circuit looks like.
1085000	1088000	Suddenly, we're not just about the CPUs anymore.
1088000	1091000	We've got these four different types of architectures.
1091000	1093000	One's biological.
1093000	1094000	One's quantum.
1094000	1096000	Or three are not biological.
1096000	1097000	We've got quantum.
1097000	1098000	We've got neuromorphic.
1098000	1100000	And we've got the digital.
1100000	1102000	And I'm arguing that the thing on the top right
1102000	1104000	will be needed.
1104000	1106000	The general intelligence is what they look like.
1106000	1108000	We've built them all.
1108000	1111000	The quantum bits are 7 bit IBM qubits.
1112000	1114000	They're 7 bit IBM processor.
1114000	1116000	Quantum processor.
1116000	1117000	There's a neuromorphic.
1117000	1119000	That's what they look like microscopically.
1119000	1120000	There's a digital.
1120000	1122000	I mentioned 10 billion on a chip.
1122000	1124000	And a processor with a CPU-PPU.
1124000	1127000	And that's how biology looks like.
1127000	1132000	So, you know, I think the neuromorphic in the biology,
1132000	1135000	the neuromorphic will map onto the biological
1135000	1139000	the best out of all of those options there.
1139000	1141000	Not to say the others aren't clear.
1141000	1143000	So, the data centers of the future.
1143000	1144000	They'll look like this.
1144000	1146000	We might just have them fill up with CPU-PPUs.
1146000	1147000	We'll have neuromorphics.
1147000	1148000	We'll have quantum.
1148000	1151000	And we'll have a little bit of classical as well.
1151000	1153000	Interesting time to head.
1153000	1155000	Deep learning.
1155000	1158000	Just going to have a couple of slides here.
1158000	1160000	There's this plethora of neural networks.
1160000	1162000	It won't get us there.
1162000	1165000	They've got very good classification and regression.
1165000	1166000	And pattern matching.
1166000	1167000	Very good.
1167000	1171000	This is all statistical analysis.
1171000	1172000	Very clever.
1172000	1175000	But nothing to do with what the brain is doing at all.
1175000	1177000	And so, this is a TensorFlow meetup.
1177000	1179000	So, I had to mention TensorFlow.
1179000	1180000	Here's how popular TensorFlow is.
1180000	1183000	So, if you're going to start on the deep learning,
1183000	1187000	you know, you need a quick pie talk to TensorFlow.
1187000	1188000	Okay.
1188000	1189000	So, that's that.
1189000	1190000	There we go.
1190000	1193000	So, what do we need?
1193000	1195000	How do we build AGI?
1196000	1198000	So, well, I would start as a physicist.
1198000	1200000	I would start with the laws of physics.
1200000	1203000	And we've come up with physics as an old subject,
1203000	1205000	about 400 years old.
1205000	1208000	Computer science is quite new, about 70 years old.
1208000	1210000	So, I will just go back and start with the laws of physics.
1210000	1212000	You know, what are the laws of physics?
1212000	1215000	Because the brain, I would argue, is a physical system.
1215000	1218000	So, probably that's the best place to start.
1218000	1220000	Don't just start writing a JavaScript.
1220000	1223000	No, start, you know, go back to basics.
1223000	1225000	This is what physics is.
1225000	1227000	And basically all the physics,
1227000	1229000	and maybe not too many people in the room know this,
1229000	1231000	can be written as a principle of least action.
1231000	1234000	S is the action, L is the function, blah, blah, blah.
1234000	1236000	You know, it's a great level of physics.
1236000	1238000	So, I know this stuff really well.
1238000	1243000	Build into me hundreds of exams and assignments, blah, blah, blah.
1243000	1245000	And there's been a book just recently called
1245000	1247000	Principles of Least Action, which surprised me.
1247000	1250000	So, it sort of has checked us on each section of physics
1250000	1252000	and how you can derive it from delta S equals zero.
1252000	1255000	So, I would start there if I was going to build
1255000	1257000	an intelligent system.
1257000	1259000	So, that's physics.
1259000	1261000	What else do we need?
1261000	1264000	So, intelligence isn't just about pattern action.
1264000	1266000	I've hope, you know, I've conveyed that already
1266000	1268000	in nine different types.
1268000	1270000	And one or two types is about pattern action, really.
1270000	1272000	It's about modeling the world, really.
1272000	1273000	That's what intelligence is.
1273000	1275000	It's how well we can model the world
1275000	1277000	and then make predictions and predict the next step.
1277000	1278000	That's how we make money.
1278000	1279000	That's how we stay alive.
1279000	1281000	You know, that's how we do everything.
1281000	1284000	That's what intelligence is, like, definition, really.
1284000	1286000	We can play chess and do all sorts of things,
1286000	1288000	but really chess is about understanding our environment,
1288000	1290000	modeling our environment,
1290000	1292000	the ability to model our environment,
1292000	1294000	then to make predictions and then to take action
1294000	1296000	from those predictions.
1296000	1299000	We need to understand, explain and understand what we see.
1299000	1301000	This is what we need to build.
1301000	1302000	We need to imagine things,
1302000	1304000	and we need to problem-solve and plan actions.
1304000	1307000	We need to build new models as we learn about the world.
1307000	1309000	Nothing to do with AlphaGo.
1309000	1313000	Nothing to do with AlphaStuff at all.
1313000	1314000	Okay.
1314000	1316000	I would argue they're super clever,
1316000	1317000	but they're statistical.
1317000	1319000	They're not really intelligent.
1319000	1320000	Okay.
1320000	1321000	So, what is intelligence?
1321000	1323000	Well, there's loads of theories.
1323000	1324000	I'm going to pick out actually,
1324000	1325000	but there's a ton of work,
1325000	1327000	and all of these people have been doing this work
1327000	1328000	for 30 years now.
1328000	1329000	There's Schmidt-Rieber,
1329000	1330000	Rooker,
1330000	1331000	Bialectic,
1331000	1332000	Princeton, Tishvie,
1332000	1335000	and Friston at UCL here.
1335000	1337000	Yeah, this is their life's work.
1337000	1339000	They're mad scientists twining away,
1339000	1341000	but sort of it's starting to happen for them.
1341000	1343000	So, they'll probably get to see a little bit of,
1343000	1345000	you know, the fruits of their labor.
1345000	1346000	Okay.
1346000	1347000	So, what is that,
1347000	1348000	the built-proofs that, when I picked up,
1348000	1352000	you're more than welcome to go home and Google all of these.
1352000	1354000	They're all got papers on archives.
1354000	1356000	They've all got wonderful websites,
1356000	1357000	loads and loads of beautiful,
1357000	1358000	really reading,
1358000	1360000	and interested in intelligence,
1360000	1361000	essentially,
1361000	1363000	and how we might get there.
1363000	1366000	And they all have useful input,
1366000	1368000	and we don't quite know which one is right,
1368000	1371000	maybe the combination is a few.
1371000	1372000	But this is what Friston's saying.
1372000	1374000	It's called active inference.
1374000	1376000	It's based on physics and information theory.
1376000	1378000	So, it's a very fundamental theory.
1378000	1381000	It uses something called the free energy principle,
1381000	1387000	and it does encompass all space and all time scales.
1387000	1390000	So, yeah, it works from the very small to the very large,
1390000	1394000	and it works from nanoseconds to the age of the universe.
1394000	1395000	It's completely general.
1395000	1396000	Yeah.
1396000	1399000	Now, I don't expect you, there is Sarah,
1399000	1401000	I don't expect you, you know,
1401000	1402000	to go, ah, I get it now,
1402000	1404000	because this is hard stuff,
1404000	1405000	and it takes a lot of reading.
1405000	1407000	It certainly took me an awful lot of time, actually,
1407000	1409000	to read through all of these different theories,
1409000	1412000	and just start at the basics of computer science.
1412000	1413000	You know, I said it took a village,
1413000	1416000	neuroscience, physics, psychology.
1416000	1419000	You know, I just learned a lot about a lot of things, right?
1419000	1420000	And we do.
1420000	1421000	This is why it's a hard problem,
1421000	1422000	unless it was so quick.
1422000	1427000	So, this is how he sort of puts it down, models it,
1427000	1429000	I guess, so the free energy principle.
1429000	1431000	You just divide the world into internal states,
1431000	1434000	which is our brain and outside the environment,
1434000	1435000	agent environment.
1435000	1437000	Anybody who's ever done reinforcement learning,
1437000	1438000	it's a similar sort of thing, right?
1438000	1440000	You have the agent and the environment,
1440000	1443000	but this kind of explains how the agent works itself.
1443000	1445000	What's going on inside the brain,
1445000	1446000	what's going on outside the brain,
1446000	1448000	it's separated by something called a Markov banquet,
1448000	1451000	which is kind of a cool-sounding name.
1451000	1453000	The guy called Julia Pulitzer,
1453000	1455000	University of Southern California,
1455000	1456000	came up with 18.
1456000	1459000	So, you know, there's this contribution from everywhere
1459000	1460000	into this theory.
1460000	1462000	And so it works from, like I say,
1462000	1465000	small to large, it works from cells to brains,
1465000	1466000	external states, internal states,
1466000	1469000	whether that's a cell, microscopic,
1469000	1473000	we saw the cell, I think that was intelligent to a brain.
1473000	1476000	The difference is the brain is much more complicated
1476000	1478000	than the cell.
1479000	1481000	So it's got none.
1481000	1483000	But that's a similar setup.
1483000	1485000	And so you can kind of, you know,
1485000	1489000	it all different scales, mice, people, bacteria.
1489000	1490000	Okay, there's the math.
1490000	1492000	The math gets ugly.
1492000	1493000	That's what it looks like.
1493000	1496000	But if you've ever read a reinforcement learning paper,
1496000	1498000	that's what that looks like as well.
1498000	1501000	So, you know, if you're a deep learning researcher,
1501000	1503000	the only difference is the physical one
1503000	1507000	that needs my entropy and things like that.
1508000	1510000	And the reinforcement learning needs to be
1510000	1512000	much more statistical.
1512000	1514000	But it's kind of similar looking,
1514000	1515000	probability distributions,
1515000	1517000	but this one's based on
1517000	1520000	fundamental physics and information theory.
1520000	1522000	Okay, don't expect you to take any of that.
1522000	1524000	And I just wanted to show off the math.
1524000	1525000	Yeah.
1525000	1527000	So, how to provide, look at that math,
1527000	1528000	but I didn't do it.
1528000	1529000	It's not mine.
1529000	1532000	Okay, so can we build it?
1532000	1535000	Well, yes, we can.
1535000	1538000	We have the theories, theories, theories, theories.
1538000	1539000	We have a few candidates.
1539000	1541000	We have the algorithm.
1541000	1542000	We even have software.
1542000	1545000	All of the professor has a big software base
1545000	1547000	that has been developed over the years.
1547000	1548000	We have the hardware.
1548000	1549000	I'm going to argue,
1549000	1550000	the neuromorphic hardware is there.
1550000	1553000	So, we run this on Spinnaker.
1553000	1554000	We should be good.
1554000	1556000	And we have data sets.
1556000	1557000	It's a thing called the internet.
1557000	1558000	We have all the data we need.
1558000	1561000	And so, I would say,
1561000	1563000	to some extent, we're kind of there.
1563000	1565000	We have the mouse screen.
1565000	1566000	And we have, you know,
1566000	1568000	the active inference running on it.
1568000	1570000	And I'd say we're kind of there.
1570000	1573000	We're kind of in the very early stages.
1573000	1575000	We're not millions of miles away,
1575000	1577000	many years away down the road.
1577000	1578000	We're sort of there.
1578000	1579000	We're on the road.
1579000	1581000	It's the neutral road.
1581000	1584000	I don't think there's anything missing.
1584000	1586000	There's no theory of missing.
1586000	1587000	There's no hardware missing.
1587000	1589000	There's no data missing.
1589000	1594000	And there's no, we have a theory.
1594000	1596000	That's a big statement, right?
1596000	1598000	So, I think we're there.
1598000	1599000	Okay.
1599000	1600000	So, what do we need?
1600000	1601000	We need hardware.
1601000	1602000	We've got a hardware.
1602000	1603000	We need a piece of clothing,
1603000	1604000	a general intelligence.
1604000	1607000	So, we need software engineers here in the room
1607000	1608000	who want to get started.
1608000	1609000	About building,
1609000	1610000	you'll be completely missed.
1610000	1612000	And, yeah,
1612000	1614000	it's the color project of our time.
1614000	1615000	I mean, you know, it's the one, right?
1615000	1617000	We've got a sort of intelligence.
1617000	1618000	We need sort of everything else.
1618000	1619000	There's many.
1619000	1620000	There's a huge,
1620000	1621000	there's a deep,
1621000	1622000	deep mind,
1622000	1623000	the brain,
1623000	1624000	the human brain project,
1624000	1625000	China,
1625000	1627000	just with this 10 million dollars,
1627000	1628000	sitting up a city,
1628000	1629000	the whole city,
1629000	1630000	EGI.
1630000	1632000	And should we build it?
1632000	1633000	I mean,
1633000	1634000	if ethics is safety,
1634000	1636000	but I'll leave that to another discussion.
1636000	1637000	Finishing off,
1637000	1639000	here's some EGI projects that are real.
1639000	1640000	They exist.
1640000	1641000	They have venture funding.
1641000	1642000	They have people.
1642000	1644000	They're working on it 24 seven every day.
1644000	1645000	That's their life.
1645000	1647000	That's what they do.
1648000	1650000	You know, I didn't put the mind up there.
1650000	1651000	Some of them are well known,
1651000	1653000	some not so well known.
1654000	1655000	Some are smaller,
1655000	1656000	some are bigger.
1656000	1657000	And so,
1657000	1658000	in conclusion,
1658000	1660000	it's obvious to most,
1660000	1662000	that deep learning is lacking the foundation,
1662000	1663000	to the general theory of intelligence.
1663000	1664000	It's based on statistics,
1664000	1666000	not physics.
1666000	1668000	Some groups are starting to look at
1668000	1670000	viable models.
1670000	1673000	And it frustrates me that they weren't starting
1673000	1675000	looking at them all along somewhere,
1675000	1676000	but a lot of this deep learning stuff
1676000	1677000	is just, you know,
1677000	1679000	it wasn't ever going to get us there.
1679000	1680000	And people, you know,
1680000	1681000	hopefully realize that now,
1681000	1683000	but I'm not that optimistic.
1684000	1685000	But I'm saying right now,
1685000	1687000	it's not going to get us there at all.
1687000	1688000	And is it?
1688000	1689000	Yeah.
1690000	1691000	I've already said,
1691000	1692000	we've sort of,
1692000	1693000	we've already,
1693000	1694000	we've already got it.
1694000	1695000	Not human level,
1695000	1696000	but mouse level.
1698000	1699000	And normal,
1699000	1701000	it might be a platform to get us there.
1701000	1703000	And I'll leave you with this,
1704000	1705000	parting words from Jeff Hinton
1705000	1706000	a bit.
1711000	1712000	Okay.
1712000	1713000	So what he was saying there
1713000	1715000	is basically what I think
1715000	1716000	the Godfather of AI
1716000	1718000	of deep learning from the 80s
1718000	1719000	and his whole life,
1719000	1720000	used to work with Princeton at UCL,
1720000	1721000	by the way,
1721000	1723000	went to Toronto in the end.
1723000	1725000	What he is saying is that deep learning
1725000	1726000	won't get us there.
1726000	1727000	It was never meant to.
1727000	1728000	I didn't make a mistake.
1728000	1729000	It's just,
1729000	1730000	I was working on something else.
1730000	1731000	What we do need,
1731000	1732000	what will get us there
1732000	1734000	is understanding the brain.
1734000	1735000	And he said,
1735000	1736000	this was in 2016.
1737000	1738000	He's saying,
1738000	1739000	I think that
1740000	1742000	we are very close to that moment.
1742000	1743000	And I've,
1743000	1744000	I've,
1744000	1745000	I've put up a few theories there,
1745000	1747000	which maybe he wasn't even aware of.
1747000	1748000	Maybe he was,
1748000	1749000	he was a smart guy,
1749000	1751000	but I believe we do understand the brain.
1751000	1752000	I believe we're there.
1752000	1753000	Thanks.
1753000	1754000	Great stuff,
1754000	1755000	round of applause.
1755000	1756000	Okay, good stuff.
1756000	1757000	So we're a little bit tight for time,
1757000	1758000	but I'm curious.
1758000	1759000	So you've done,
1759000	1760000	you've been a research fellow.
1760000	1761000	You've obviously been running
1761000	1762000	deep learning partnerships
1762000	1763000	for quite a while now.
1763000	1764000	Yeah.
1764000	1766000	What is your interest?
1766000	1767000	How come so much focus
1767000	1768000	we're interested in this?
1768000	1770000	And where do we find you online?
1770000	1771000	And what are your next,
1771000	1772000	what's your next project?
1772000	1773000	Yeah.
1773000	1774000	So I have started a company called
1774000	1775000	TuringAI.co.
1775000	1776000	Which was up there, right?
1776000	1777000	Yeah.
1777000	1778000	Yeah.
1778000	1779000	Maybe it would have been interesting.
1779000	1780000	It was one of the boxes up there.
1780000	1781000	Yeah, it was, actually.
1781000	1782000	One of the boxes.
1782000	1783000	Tell us about that.
1783000	1784000	Yeah.
1784000	1785000	Turing,
1785000	1786000	like it is now,
1786000	1787000	TuringAI.co.
1787000	1788000	Now,
1788000	1790000	I've actually started that company
1790000	1791000	with Professor Frisson
1791000	1792000	and a couple of very clever post-docs.
1793000	1794000	So we're working on this.
1794000	1796000	Schmidt Hooper's working on it.
1796000	1798000	Weilich at Princeton's working on it.
1798000	1799000	DeepMind are working on it.
1799000	1800000	So I'm not saying that
1800000	1801000	we're going to crack it first,
1801000	1802000	but yeah,
1802000	1805000	we're very involved in solving the problem.
1805000	1806000	Big respect.
1806000	1807000	Well, with you all the way,
1807000	1808000	we'll have you back on TensorFlow
1808000	1809000	once you solve that problem.
1809000	1810000	Yeah.
1810000	1811000	Okay, cool.
1811000	1812000	Next,
1812000	1813000	we've got time for two quick questions.
1813000	1814000	Anyone in the crowd?
1814000	1815000	Okay, gentlemen.
1815000	1816000	Introduce yourself.
1816000	1817000	Hi.
1817000	1818000	My name is Erdogan.
1818000	1819000	Yeah.
1819000	1820000	I help you.
1821000	1822000	The one you mentioned,
1822000	1824000	which is less publicity.
1824000	1825000	Given that 3.0
1825000	1826000	could be deep blue
1826000	1828000	within nine hours of learning,
1828000	1829000	why isn't there something similar
1829000	1830000	being done to promote it?
1830000	1831000	Yeah.
1831000	1832000	So, I mean,
1832000	1833000	I don't know,
1833000	1834000	really,
1834000	1836000	they're using reinforcement voting
1836000	1837000	and lack of,
1837000	1838000	you know,
1838000	1839000	Monte Carlo's
1839000	1840000	tree certifications.
1840000	1841000	Right.
1841000	1842000	So,
1842000	1843000	you know,
1843000	1844000	I don't know,
1844000	1845000	I don't know,
1845000	1846000	I don't know,
1846000	1847000	I don't know,
1847000	1848000	I don't know,
1848000	1849000	everything's been right.
1849000	1849800	So,
1849800	1851000	I'm not going to take anything
1851000	1852000	away from any of that work,
1852000	1853000	it's brilliant, right.
1854000	1855000	Remember,
1855000	1856460	calculator can out
1856460	1857440	calculators that modify two
1857440	1859000	large numbers together.
1859000	1860000	You know
1860000	1861000	there's no way
1861000	1862000	we're ever going to be
1864000	1865000	going against or go over again.
1865000	1866000	It's super clear.
1866000	1867000	But remember,
1867000	1868000	my nine types of intelligent
1868000	1869000	but can't do anything
1869000	1870000	as it may be.
1870000	1871000	I can't write a symphony.
1871000	1872000	We need a differential reversal
1872000	1873000	for that.
1873000	1874000	So,
1874000	1875000	you know,
1875000	1876000	how do we integrate them all
1876000	1877000	together?
1877000	1881000	Yeah, that's a pretty big problem actually, yeah, that's clear.
1881000	1885000	Any other questions?
1885000	1895000	Hi, my name is Nuki, I'm just wondering, what's the
1895000	1901000	number of neurons in the system?
1901000	1905000	Yeah, nothing like it, so that's a great point, so there's two
1905000	1908000	neurons, there's a number of neurons, but there's also the connectivity between the
1908000	1914000	neurons, so the biology seems to like to connect about a thousand to ten
1914000	1918000	thousand synapses per neuron, so if Spinnaker is nowhere near that, it might
1918000	1923000	have a few dozen, so that's a very important mention.
1923000	1927000	Connectivity is super important to you.
1927000	1931000	Can I start talking a little more? There's one over here.
1931000	1938000	Hi, my name is Marco, I work at the real startup called
1938000	1945000	Erypadet. My question is, you focus a lot on the CPU architecture, but obviously the charge
1945000	1951000	tool in the thesis says that any function that is computable can be executed by any
1951000	1957000	machine, whether it's a biologist, whether it's a CPU, whether it's a GPU, is it just the
1957000	1962000	execution speed that you care about, or do you see anything wrong with the charge
1962000	1963000	tool?
1963000	1967000	No, I do believe that's a great question, and there's been a lot of debate, even for
1967000	1972000	the last philosophical debate, about whether the brain is Turing complete, and I
1972000	1977000	think it is, and most people do as well, so it's a very fringe people who say there's
1977000	1981000	something else in the brain that's not Turing complete, so I don't believe there's
1981000	1986000	any bottleneck there at all, I just think it's a different type of computational system.
1986000	1991000	We're going to follow you, generally connect with any type of CPU.
1991000	1998000	Yeah, I still think we need the synaptic connections, like a thousand to ten thousand, so it really
1998000	2005000	is a deeply embedded hardware problem, but that hardware is Turing complete, so the general
2005000	2012000	theory of computation applies, but it's just a different hardware, that's a good question.
2012000	2014000	Okay, thank you.
