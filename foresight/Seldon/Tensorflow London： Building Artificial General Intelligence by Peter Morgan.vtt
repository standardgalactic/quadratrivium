WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Now, so I'm going to talk about EGI.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
I've got long, I've got lots of slides, so I'll move very quickly.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Here's a report I wrote for Riley.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
There's a company I started as an AI consulting company.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
And so what are we going to talk about?

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
So the first question we have to ask, and I apologize if you've seen this talk before,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
I had given it a few times, hopefully there's none in the room who has.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
What is intelligence and then what physical systems are available for us to get inspiration from

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
and how far have we come in building the hardware.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
And then I'm going to look at very briefly deep learning as, you know,

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
just ask very quickly the question, are we on the right track?

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
And then with deep learning, is that going to get us all the way to EGI?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
The answer is no, spoiler.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
And so what do we need, what's missing?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I'll do a very quick overview at the end.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
And we'll look at one particular, one theory in particular called active inference.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
And amongst a whole, you know, zoo of theories, really, EGI theories.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
We'll pick that one out, I'll explain why.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And then I'll wrap it up with conclusions.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So, you know, why do we want to build it?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Well, it's kind of obvious, right?

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
We want to build it to solve the problem of the century, probably,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
of the human race, maybe, arguably, so I might argue.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
And then, you know, to make lots of money doing it, but really it's just to solve it.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And see, and then once we solve it, as DeepMind said, we can use it to solve everything else.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
That includes all science or medicine, how to live longer, how to be alive,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
new materials, you name it, you know, spacecraft, explore the galaxies, use your imagination.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So that really is the aim, right?

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
To build general level intelligence and quite quickly, you know,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
move beyond that to superintelligence.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
So, you know, a quick question I always ask the audience.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Are any of these general intelligence?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
So we've got Watson there, Super Impressive, you know,

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
we've got the chess playing Deep Blue, IBM, Alpha Star, just very recently,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
you know, DeepMind built that system that could beat some of the best players at Starcraft.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
And online game and AlphaGo.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
So, no, no matter how impressive all of these are, and they certainly were,

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
you know, years into making 10, 20, 30 years since the birth of AI, maybe,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
they're not, they're nothing to do with AI.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
So, and here's why, because intelligence is much broader than that.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Remember, we asked the question, what is intelligence?

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Well, a guy called Howard Gardner at Harvard, I think in the 90s,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
wrote down quite a nice way of categorizing it.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
So you put it into nine categories.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
So we've got naturalist understanding nature, the external world, can go do that, no.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
You know, and I want to keep going, can go do that, can go do that.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
The answer is no, no, no.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
The spatial visualization.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
So we have AI, you know, that can do maybe one of these really well,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
but never more than two, right?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So we're nowhere near AI.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
Intrapersonal introspection, you know, there's a TPU sitting in a Google Data Center.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
No matter what algorithm you run on it, it doesn't go, why am I here?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Right, why am I a TPU who made me?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Right, no.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
This is all part of intelligence.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Introspection, even though I make light of it, is, you know,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
a very important aspect of intelligence.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Language, linguistics, we have NLP.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
We can have things that read and classify sentences.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
And, you know, are they created?

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
It's mostly based on statistical analysis of words and images and pixels and whatnot.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
It's not quite how the brain does it, or the biological brain.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
We have movement.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
You know, the best assets in the world get paid, you know,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
all players getting transferred for 100, 200 million pounds, right?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I mean, there's some of the highest-paid people in the world,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
because they use their body so well.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
The basketball players in America, the football players in Europe.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So that's a part of intelligence.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
And, you know, we have robotics, right?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
So there's nowhere, we haven't got any robots that can play football like Nestle,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
or, you know, the Beth, Michael Jordan, and muscle balls.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
They work very close.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Although, you know, impressive progress has been made with that.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You see it being backflips and whatnot.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Super impressive, right?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
It's quite general, even that one small limit of sense.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Interpersonal, how we communicate with each other in the world.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Animals, ourselves.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Interpersonal, communications, modeling what the other person is thinking, right?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And then predicting what their next move will be.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Now, we know that.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It's essential.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
That's the way we hear it.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
And the logical mathematical path that we've kind of got.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I would argue, you know, fight with it, chess, and go,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and numerical stuff and calculate it.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's a very simple calculator.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So we probably were okay in that quadrant.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
And then musical and other creative art music, writing poems, just, you know,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
but mostly musical, you know, writing would be linguistic.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
So art, the creative fine arts.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah, you know, AI, narrow AI has written some songs,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
but, you know, use the word written very loosely.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
You know, one could argue again, it's statistical, not creative.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
So what are we missing?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
So, you know, how far have we come?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Well, like, the highest is probably logical mathematical at 50%.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
So calculation is great, but not creativity.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
You know, they can't really invent new games of go or new types of math yet.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
You know, there's mathematicians in the world, the guys who gets the field there that we haven't,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
they can't, you know, do math at the level of the field there,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
that's sort of a Nobel Prize winner.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And linguistic is good as they are.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
It's in creating stuff and complete sentence,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
completion and, you know, sentiment analysis.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's a statistical analysis.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
It's not what we're doing.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
It's not a creative thing.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And then I don't know how to read the list, right?

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Spatial, we've got the span and body, you've got atlas.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
You know, in understanding the environment, I thought 10%, that's a generous 10% music,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
you know, Google, the Gentile, 50%.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
These are all pretty generous numbers, I would say.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
So basically, you know, we know we need a general intelligence.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
We're not at 100%, but we can do all of these really well.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
You know, we specialize in what we pick, what we put out and specialize,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
but we can do them all.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
So it takes a village to, you know, raise a child,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
and it's going to take a village to create AGI.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So we're going to need computer science.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
That's the one that everybody's got right now,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
but also going to need physics, we're going to need neuroscience,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
and we're going to need psychology.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
We're going to need people from all walks of life,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
because that word general means general, right?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
It's everything.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
And so let's move on now to the hardware.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You know, how far we've got with the hardware.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Then we'll look at the algorithms and we'll put it all together at the end.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
So we basically look at, you know, we have an existence proof.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
That's us.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
You know, that's a three pound of wet flesh in ourselves.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
That's what's creating this general intelligence,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
unless you believe in something else.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
But, you know, neuroscience, physics tells us that it's all we have.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
So we need to get, we are getting inspiration.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Maybe not enough, actually, but this is where it's the first place.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
You know, I would probably start looking at how nature builds intelligence,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
or how nature hits built intelligence,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
even though it's had a little bit of a hit start on us,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
like four billion years.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
You could argue the big bang, 13 billion years.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
We've only been doing it for about 50.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
But it's come up with this thing up here in our skulls,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
that can come up with a general theory of relativity,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
play chess, play go, drive a car, go shopping, raise children,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
create mathematics, do this,

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
pay, you know, everything that civilization has done,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
you know, there's a little three pound thing up here.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Given there's a lot of us, and, you know, we think we're on our own,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
we don't collectively, we know we're near there, are we?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We're honest with ourselves.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So how does nature do it?

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Well, you know, you start off with a single cell organism.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
This is where the definition of intelligence gets a little bit tricky.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
It's like, is that thing intelligent?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
It's alive, it's living, it responds to its environment.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I would argue, yes, it stays alive, manages to stay alive

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
over billions of years even.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Maybe it's more intelligent than us in that respect, the way you see.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And it reproduces.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
It doesn't come out, it can't come up with a general theory of relativity.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
So in some sense, it has limited intelligence,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
but it's still intelligent.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
So, you know, what's that doing?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Can we reproduce that?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Let's start there.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
That's the C. elegans worm.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
It has 100, 302 neurons.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It has a central nervous system.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
It's an organism with the simplest nervous system,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
CNS, central nervous system, 302 neurons.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
We can build that today.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
We've got models of that.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
So that's sort of where we are.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
You know, we have 80 billion, 100 billion neurons.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
We're at 300.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So we've got a little road to travel,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
but if we can kind of understand how that thing works,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
you know, maybe we can extrapolate and scale a little bit.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
We can't give ourselves too hard of time.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
In the last 10 years, we can model a C. elegans worm.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
We have a bumblebee.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
That's about a million neurons.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
And they can navigate and do little dances

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
and tell the rest of the bee colony where the hunt,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
where the polliners and come back and mate and stay alive.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
They're super intelligent.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I would argue they're super intelligent, right?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
They cannot come up with the general theory of relativity,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
but they're still super smart.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
We haven't got that far.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
And then there's these things,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
the wick mushy bit in our head,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
three pounds in our skull.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
And we know any of that, even though, you know, it's small, right?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I mean, we're trying to understand the universe,

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
the cosmos, the galaxy.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
We're kind of, you know, doing a better job.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
We can't even understand the tiny little thing.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I mean, just, it's not just.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
It's very, very clever.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
It's had billions of years to evolve.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
So, you know, what are we missing?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
What's the math?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
What's the mathematical model to build something

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
that can model or come up with math

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
and model its environment into personal introspection?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
How does that happen, right?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
That's what we've got to figure out.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
It's not it.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It's no small problem.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
So, the first thing we notice from biology is it's hierarchical.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
It starts off with molecules and neurons cells

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
and then networks of cells

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
and then sort of subsections of the brain

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
or integrated connected together wonderfully

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
to create a whole brain.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
That's a connectome.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
And, you know, there's a part doing math.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
There's a part doing language.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
There's a part doing emotion.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
There's a part.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Is there a part that creates music?

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Is there another part that drives a car?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Another part that, you know,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
or is it all sort of integrated?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
You know, so that's the kind of inspiration

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
we need to take from biology

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
and kind of use that to build mathematical models

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
and then actually build it in physical hardware.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Because Simon said,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
we don't understand anything in this.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
We can build it.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
And I quite agree, right?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
We can write down any mathematical stuff we like.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
There's lots of models,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
the public kits, all sorts of different models.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
But until we build it,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
we don't really understand.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
We don't know if it tries.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It's just a few.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Okay.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And then, yeah,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
certainly we have societies

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
which are kind of hierarchical.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
We organize ourselves hierarchical in cities

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
and countries and nations, et cetera.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Right?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Okay.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
So this is biology.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Super complicated, super complex, right?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
You know, do we have to go down to that level of complexity?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Well, that's a good question.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Or can we just start at the cell in Europe?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
That's a bit of an open question right now.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
It's good to have open questions

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
about science.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
That's what science is about, okay?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
But then it sort of organized itself

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
into about two million of these cortical columns.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
So the brain has some sort of sort of substructure there.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
And it's quite common over the whole brain

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
in the neocortex.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah, the math part, the seeing, the hearing.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
So one part of our brain,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
if we go blind or whatever through accident,

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
those cortical columns are used to analyze the sound.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
So there's something very fundamental

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
going on there.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
These are all clues.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
From biology, there's a connectome,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
and there's a central nervous system

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
that helps all connect together.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Maybe we don't need to build bodies.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
You know, if you want robots, we do.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
But if we just want something that thinks really well,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
create series like Stephen Hawking.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I mean, you can parallelize it to get around.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
But I'm just saying that we only need the rest of that

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
if we want to build a robot, okay?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
We're really focused on the neocortex

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
a bit in the skull.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Okay, and then there's the societal limits.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
So what have we built with hardware?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Okay, well, we've come a long way.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
We're up to about 10 billion transistors,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
and there's different types,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
CPU, GPU, the Graphcore, IQ.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And there's different types of,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
due to different data sets, basically.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
So if you want to understand environmental data,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
that's where we probably need something beyond the GPU.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
The GPU is really good at matrix modification,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and the brain doesn't do matrix modification

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
to understand and create, right?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
But deep learning does.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
So we do need GPUs to that and CPUs.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
But if we really need to go beyond

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
in a different sort of hardware architecture,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
if we do want to have general intelligence.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay, so there's a little nostalgia here.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
That's a cray, over 40 years ago,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
160 megaflops, how quaint, you know,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
we have teraflops in our pocket now.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
So this is where we are today.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
We have, you know, with Moore's Law,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
we've had a factor of a million or so since then.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
So we've got the i9 Intel CPU,

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
we've got the NVIDIA V100 Volta GPU,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
we've got the Google TPU version 3,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
which are absolutely pedaflops,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
but just beyond the TPU,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
coming online is the Graphcore IQ.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
But really, these are all matrix multipliers.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So super impressive, you know,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
we've got 100 pedaflops in a thing that, you know,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
we've put on this stage,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
which is somewhat what the brain does.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I think the brain does about a pedaflop or so.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
So it's not about raw computation, right?

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
If it was, we would be there.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
This thing would be coming up with theories

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
of relativity and all sorts of stuff.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
We're trying to find physics and creating symphonies,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
but it can't.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
It's done as a brick, right?

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Instead of that, that's exaflops, right?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
That's a thousand times a pedaflop.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
So we're going to need something more.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
What are we missing in the hardware, right?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
So it's not just about hardware.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
It's actually about the hardware,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
which is pretty obvious when you think about it,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
because what's up here is a little different

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
than the hardware we've just seen.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
What about neuromorphic computing?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
So this is where things get interesting,

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
because now we're using analog circuits,

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
which is what the brain is.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
The brain uses spiking neural networks,

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
which is almost a combination of analog and digital.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
So there's a guy called Steve Berber,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
one of the co-founders of ARM.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
After 20 years, he left ARM

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
in the University of Manchester 20 years ago.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
He set up a project called Spinnacle,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
which is now being folded into the human brain project.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
There's IBM True North.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
There's brain scales at the human brain project.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
There's various projects throughout the world

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
building this analog hardware.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
So to me, I think this is a big part of it.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Albums are certainly important,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
but I think the hardware is important as well.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
So Spinnacle, we've got a billion neurons.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
So a hundred times that, we've got the human brain.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So we've built a mouse brain already,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
and it can do stuff like navigate through mazes

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and play Sudoku and do crossword puzzles.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
It does intelligent stuff,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
and you know, some people have heard of that,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
but it does not get depressed, does it?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Deep mind does.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Now, for go, everything else, it doesn't.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I argue that this is part of my thesis

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
that this is what will take us to general intelligence.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
And there it is.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Five racks are up to 10 now.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
There it is, sitting in a data center in Manchester,

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
part of the human brain project,

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
and that is neuromorphic computing.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
There's a billion neurons here.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
There's a mouse brain right there.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
It's a little bigger than a mouse brain,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
but we've seen with Moore's Law,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
we're quite good at scaling, right?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
So the point is, we've built some stuff here

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
which might be useful for us.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
And that's how you scale up.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
You put 1,000 neurons on a core.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You put 18 cores on a chip.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
You send it away.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
You get it built.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
It comes back.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
You put them together.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You put the chips on the board,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
put boards in a rack,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
and then you get 10 cabinets,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
and you put quite racks in each cabinet.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
You've got 50 servers, neuromorphic servers,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and you have a mouse brain.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
That's how you do it, and it's been done.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
That is the brain scale approach that I mentioned

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
at the human brain project.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
That's about the same size as the spinnaker

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
and the same power,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
got a mouse brain,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
uses a slightly different architecture.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I won't go into the details.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
True North IBM uses a slightly different architecture,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
but the point is, you're all neuromorphic,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
and you're all analog based on spiking your networks.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
And that's sort of general intelligent mouse level

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
compared to the Google TPUs,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
which are super impressive at different types of things.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I'd argue they won't get us a general intelligence

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
with the thing on the left side.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
What about quantum?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I don't think the brain is quantum.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
It's too warm and wet.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Quantum needs super cold temperatures.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It's decoherence very quickly.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I don't think there's qubits in the brain,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
but they look nice.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I put a picture of one on there.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
That's what a quantum circuit looks like.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Suddenly, we're not just about the CPUs anymore.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
We've got these four different types of architectures.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
One's biological.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
One's quantum.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Or three are not biological.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
We've got quantum.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
We've got neuromorphic.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And we've got the digital.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
And I'm arguing that the thing on the top right

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
will be needed.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
The general intelligence is what they look like.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
We've built them all.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
The quantum bits are 7 bit IBM qubits.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
They're 7 bit IBM processor.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Quantum processor.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
There's a neuromorphic.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
That's what they look like microscopically.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
There's a digital.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I mentioned 10 billion on a chip.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And a processor with a CPU-PPU.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
And that's how biology looks like.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
So, you know, I think the neuromorphic in the biology,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
the neuromorphic will map onto the biological

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
the best out of all of those options there.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Not to say the others aren't clear.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
So, the data centers of the future.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
They'll look like this.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
We might just have them fill up with CPU-PPUs.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
We'll have neuromorphics.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
We'll have quantum.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
And we'll have a little bit of classical as well.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Interesting time to head.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Deep learning.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Just going to have a couple of slides here.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
There's this plethora of neural networks.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It won't get us there.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
They've got very good classification and regression.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
And pattern matching.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Very good.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
This is all statistical analysis.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Very clever.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
But nothing to do with what the brain is doing at all.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And so, this is a TensorFlow meetup.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
So, I had to mention TensorFlow.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Here's how popular TensorFlow is.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
So, if you're going to start on the deep learning,

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
you know, you need a quick pie talk to TensorFlow.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Okay.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
So, that's that.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
There we go.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
So, what do we need?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
How do we build AGI?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
So, well, I would start as a physicist.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I would start with the laws of physics.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
And we've come up with physics as an old subject,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
about 400 years old.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Computer science is quite new, about 70 years old.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
So, I will just go back and start with the laws of physics.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
You know, what are the laws of physics?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Because the brain, I would argue, is a physical system.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
So, probably that's the best place to start.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Don't just start writing a JavaScript.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
No, start, you know, go back to basics.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
This is what physics is.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
And basically all the physics,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
and maybe not too many people in the room know this,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
can be written as a principle of least action.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
S is the action, L is the function, blah, blah, blah.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
You know, it's a great level of physics.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
So, I know this stuff really well.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
Build into me hundreds of exams and assignments, blah, blah, blah.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And there's been a book just recently called

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Principles of Least Action, which surprised me.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
So, it sort of has checked us on each section of physics

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
and how you can derive it from delta S equals zero.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
So, I would start there if I was going to build

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
an intelligent system.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
So, that's physics.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
What else do we need?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
So, intelligence isn't just about pattern action.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
I've hope, you know, I've conveyed that already

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
in nine different types.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And one or two types is about pattern action, really.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's about modeling the world, really.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
That's what intelligence is.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It's how well we can model the world

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
and then make predictions and predict the next step.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
That's how we make money.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
That's how we stay alive.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
You know, that's how we do everything.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
That's what intelligence is, like, definition, really.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
We can play chess and do all sorts of things,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
but really chess is about understanding our environment,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
modeling our environment,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
the ability to model our environment,

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
then to make predictions and then to take action

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
from those predictions.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
We need to understand, explain and understand what we see.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
This is what we need to build.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
We need to imagine things,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
and we need to problem-solve and plan actions.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
We need to build new models as we learn about the world.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Nothing to do with AlphaGo.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Nothing to do with AlphaStuff at all.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Okay.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I would argue they're super clever,

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
but they're statistical.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
They're not really intelligent.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Okay.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
So, what is intelligence?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Well, there's loads of theories.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I'm going to pick out actually,

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
but there's a ton of work,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
and all of these people have been doing this work

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
for 30 years now.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
There's Schmidt-Rieber,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Rooker,

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Bialectic,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Princeton, Tishvie,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
and Friston at UCL here.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, this is their life's work.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
They're mad scientists twining away,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
but sort of it's starting to happen for them.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
So, they'll probably get to see a little bit of,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
you know, the fruits of their labor.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Okay.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
So, what is that,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
the built-proofs that, when I picked up,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
you're more than welcome to go home and Google all of these.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
They're all got papers on archives.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
They've all got wonderful websites,

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
loads and loads of beautiful,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
really reading,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
and interested in intelligence,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
essentially,

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
and how we might get there.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
And they all have useful input,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and we don't quite know which one is right,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
maybe the combination is a few.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
But this is what Friston's saying.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
It's called active inference.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
It's based on physics and information theory.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
So, it's a very fundamental theory.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
It uses something called the free energy principle,

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
and it does encompass all space and all time scales.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
So, yeah, it works from the very small to the very large,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
and it works from nanoseconds to the age of the universe.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
It's completely general.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Now, I don't expect you, there is Sarah,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't expect you, you know,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
to go, ah, I get it now,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
because this is hard stuff,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
and it takes a lot of reading.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
It certainly took me an awful lot of time, actually,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
to read through all of these different theories,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
and just start at the basics of computer science.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
You know, I said it took a village,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
neuroscience, physics, psychology.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
You know, I just learned a lot about a lot of things, right?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
And we do.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
This is why it's a hard problem,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
unless it was so quick.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
So, this is how he sort of puts it down, models it,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I guess, so the free energy principle.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
You just divide the world into internal states,

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
which is our brain and outside the environment,

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
agent environment.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Anybody who's ever done reinforcement learning,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
it's a similar sort of thing, right?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
You have the agent and the environment,

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
but this kind of explains how the agent works itself.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
What's going on inside the brain,

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
what's going on outside the brain,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
it's separated by something called a Markov banquet,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
which is kind of a cool-sounding name.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
The guy called Julia Pulitzer,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
University of Southern California,

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
came up with 18.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
So, you know, there's this contribution from everywhere

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
into this theory.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
And so it works from, like I say,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
small to large, it works from cells to brains,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
external states, internal states,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
whether that's a cell, microscopic,

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
we saw the cell, I think that was intelligent to a brain.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
The difference is the brain is much more complicated

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
than the cell.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
So it's got none.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
But that's a similar setup.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And so you can kind of, you know,

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
it all different scales, mice, people, bacteria.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Okay, there's the math.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The math gets ugly.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
That's what it looks like.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
But if you've ever read a reinforcement learning paper,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
that's what that looks like as well.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
So, you know, if you're a deep learning researcher,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
the only difference is the physical one

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
that needs my entropy and things like that.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And the reinforcement learning needs to be

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
much more statistical.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But it's kind of similar looking,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
probability distributions,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
but this one's based on

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
fundamental physics and information theory.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Okay, don't expect you to take any of that.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And I just wanted to show off the math.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
So, how to provide, look at that math,

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
but I didn't do it.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
It's not mine.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Okay, so can we build it?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Well, yes, we can.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
We have the theories, theories, theories, theories.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
We have a few candidates.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
We have the algorithm.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
We even have software.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
All of the professor has a big software base

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
that has been developed over the years.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
We have the hardware.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
I'm going to argue,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
the neuromorphic hardware is there.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
So, we run this on Spinnaker.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
We should be good.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And we have data sets.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
It's a thing called the internet.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
We have all the data we need.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
And so, I would say,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
to some extent, we're kind of there.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
We have the mouse screen.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
And we have, you know,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
the active inference running on it.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And I'd say we're kind of there.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
We're kind of in the very early stages.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
We're not millions of miles away,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
many years away down the road.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
We're sort of there.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
We're on the road.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
It's the neutral road.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I don't think there's anything missing.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
There's no theory of missing.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
There's no hardware missing.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
There's no data missing.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
And there's no, we have a theory.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
That's a big statement, right?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
So, I think we're there.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Okay.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
So, what do we need?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
We need hardware.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
We've got a hardware.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
We need a piece of clothing,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
a general intelligence.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
So, we need software engineers here in the room

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
who want to get started.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
About building,

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
you'll be completely missed.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And, yeah,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
it's the color project of our time.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
I mean, you know, it's the one, right?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
We've got a sort of intelligence.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
We need sort of everything else.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
There's many.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
There's a huge,

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
there's a deep,

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
deep mind,

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
the brain,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
the human brain project,

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
China,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
just with this 10 million dollars,

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
sitting up a city,

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
the whole city,

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
EGI.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And should we build it?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I mean,

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
if ethics is safety,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
but I'll leave that to another discussion.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Finishing off,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
here's some EGI projects that are real.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
They exist.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
They have venture funding.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
They have people.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
They're working on it 24 seven every day.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
That's their life.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That's what they do.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You know, I didn't put the mind up there.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Some of them are well known,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
some not so well known.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Some are smaller,

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
some are bigger.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
And so,

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
in conclusion,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
it's obvious to most,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
that deep learning is lacking the foundation,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
to the general theory of intelligence.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
It's based on statistics,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
not physics.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Some groups are starting to look at

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
viable models.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
And it frustrates me that they weren't starting

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
looking at them all along somewhere,

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
but a lot of this deep learning stuff

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
is just, you know,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
it wasn't ever going to get us there.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
And people, you know,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
hopefully realize that now,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
but I'm not that optimistic.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
But I'm saying right now,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
it's not going to get us there at all.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
And is it?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
I've already said,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
we've sort of,

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
we've already,

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
we've already got it.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Not human level,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
but mouse level.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
And normal,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
it might be a platform to get us there.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
And I'll leave you with this,

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
parting words from Jeff Hinton

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
a bit.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Okay.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
So what he was saying there

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
is basically what I think

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
the Godfather of AI

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
of deep learning from the 80s

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
and his whole life,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
used to work with Princeton at UCL,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
by the way,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
went to Toronto in the end.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
What he is saying is that deep learning

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
won't get us there.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
It was never meant to.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I didn't make a mistake.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It's just,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
I was working on something else.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
What we do need,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
what will get us there

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
is understanding the brain.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
And he said,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
this was in 2016.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
He's saying,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I think that

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
we are very close to that moment.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
And I've,

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I've,

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I've put up a few theories there,

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
which maybe he wasn't even aware of.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Maybe he was,

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
he was a smart guy,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
but I believe we do understand the brain.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
I believe we're there.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Thanks.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Great stuff,

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
round of applause.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Okay, good stuff.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
So we're a little bit tight for time,

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
but I'm curious.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
So you've done,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
you've been a research fellow.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
You've obviously been running

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
deep learning partnerships

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
for quite a while now.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Yeah.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
What is your interest?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
How come so much focus

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
we're interested in this?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And where do we find you online?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
And what are your next,

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
what's your next project?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Yeah.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
So I have started a company called

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
TuringAI.co.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Which was up there, right?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Yeah.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Maybe it would have been interesting.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
It was one of the boxes up there.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Yeah, it was, actually.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
One of the boxes.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Tell us about that.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Yeah.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Turing,

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
like it is now,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
TuringAI.co.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Now,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I've actually started that company

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
with Professor Frisson

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
and a couple of very clever post-docs.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
So we're working on this.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Schmidt Hooper's working on it.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Weilich at Princeton's working on it.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
DeepMind are working on it.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
So I'm not saying that

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
we're going to crack it first,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
but yeah,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
we're very involved in solving the problem.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Big respect.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Well, with you all the way,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
we'll have you back on TensorFlow

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
once you solve that problem.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Yeah.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Okay, cool.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Next,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
we've got time for two quick questions.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Anyone in the crowd?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
Okay, gentlemen.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Introduce yourself.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Hi.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
My name is Erdogan.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
I help you.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
The one you mentioned,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
which is less publicity.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Given that 3.0

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
could be deep blue

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
within nine hours of learning,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
why isn't there something similar

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
being done to promote it?

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Yeah.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
So, I mean,

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
I don't know,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
really,

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
they're using reinforcement voting

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
and lack of,

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
you know,

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Monte Carlo's

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
tree certifications.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Right.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
So,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
you know,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
I don't know,

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I don't know,

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I don't know,

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I don't know,

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
I don't know,

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
everything's been right.

30:49.000 --> 30:49.800
So,

30:49.800 --> 30:51.000
I'm not going to take anything

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
away from any of that work,

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
it's brilliant, right.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Remember,

30:55.000 --> 30:56.460
calculator can out

30:56.460 --> 30:57.440
calculators that modify two

30:57.440 --> 30:59.000
large numbers together.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
You know

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
there's no way

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
we're ever going to be

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
going against or go over again.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
It's super clear.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
But remember,

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
my nine types of intelligent

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
but can't do anything

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
as it may be.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
I can't write a symphony.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
We need a differential reversal

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
for that.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
So,

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
you know,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
how do we integrate them all

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
together?

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Yeah, that's a pretty big problem actually, yeah, that's clear.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Any other questions?

31:25.000 --> 31:35.000
Hi, my name is Nuki, I'm just wondering, what's the

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
number of neurons in the system?

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
Yeah, nothing like it, so that's a great point, so there's two

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
neurons, there's a number of neurons, but there's also the connectivity between the

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
neurons, so the biology seems to like to connect about a thousand to ten

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
thousand synapses per neuron, so if Spinnaker is nowhere near that, it might

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
have a few dozen, so that's a very important mention.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
Connectivity is super important to you.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
Can I start talking a little more? There's one over here.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
Hi, my name is Marco, I work at the real startup called

32:18.000 --> 32:25.000
Erypadet. My question is, you focus a lot on the CPU architecture, but obviously the charge

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
tool in the thesis says that any function that is computable can be executed by any

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
machine, whether it's a biologist, whether it's a CPU, whether it's a GPU, is it just the

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
execution speed that you care about, or do you see anything wrong with the charge

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
tool?

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
No, I do believe that's a great question, and there's been a lot of debate, even for

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
the last philosophical debate, about whether the brain is Turing complete, and I

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
think it is, and most people do as well, so it's a very fringe people who say there's

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
something else in the brain that's not Turing complete, so I don't believe there's

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
any bottleneck there at all, I just think it's a different type of computational system.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
We're going to follow you, generally connect with any type of CPU.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah, I still think we need the synaptic connections, like a thousand to ten thousand, so it really

33:18.000 --> 33:25.000
is a deeply embedded hardware problem, but that hardware is Turing complete, so the general

33:25.000 --> 33:32.000
theory of computation applies, but it's just a different hardware, that's a good question.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Okay, thank you.
