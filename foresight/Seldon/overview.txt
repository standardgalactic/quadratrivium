Checking Seldon/Tensorflow London： Building Artificial General Intelligence by Peter Morgan.txt
1. Erdogan from the audience asked about why there isn't more promotion for AI to learn and improve as quickly as Deep Blue did, noting that current methods like reinforcement learning and tree certifications (Monte Carlo) could be improved. Sam Altman acknowledged the brilliance of the work done in this area but emphasized that we're far from reaching human-level general intelligence, which involves nine types of intelligence that AI currently cannot achieve, such as creativity or understanding nuance.

2. Nuki from the audience inquired about the number of neurons in the system and pointed out the importance of connectivity between neurons, mentioning that biological systems have a high degree of synaptic connectivity, which is significantly less in current AI systems like Spinnaker. Sam Altman agreed and highlighted that connectivity is crucial and that current AI systems are nowhere near the complexity of biological neural networks.

3. Marco from Erypadet questioned the focus on CPU architecture and mentioned Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems, which suggest any sufficiently powerful system can compute anything computable. Sam Altman acknowledged this philosophical debate but stated that while the brain is believed to be Turing complete, the difference lies in the type of computation and hardware used, not a fundamental limitation on what is computable. He reiterated the importance of synaptic connections and the need for different hardware for AI to truly achieve human-level intelligence.
