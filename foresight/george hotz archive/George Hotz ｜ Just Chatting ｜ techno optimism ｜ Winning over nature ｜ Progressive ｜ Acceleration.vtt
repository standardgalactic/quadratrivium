WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Welcome, welcome, welcome to my stream, hello everybody, our chair over here, we can sit

00:14.000 --> 00:20.880
down, we're not really that visible though, we can maybe tilt it down a little, we're

00:20.880 --> 00:27.760
gonna write on the whiteboard, let's wait for some people to get in here, oh good morning,

00:27.920 --> 00:30.800
we don't subscribe, we're only chat, we don't need to subscribe, we're only chat, thank you for

00:30.800 --> 00:39.280
subscribing. Is this setup working? We have the whiteboard today, no computer, only whiteboard.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.320
I did a lot of thinking about the last stream, I did a lot of thinking about the

00:50.640 --> 00:59.440
techno-peasantism argument for the last one, it was brought up in a few things and we can discuss

01:02.880 --> 01:12.400
crisis of meaning, right, maybe you've heard this phrase, who thinks it's true,

01:13.520 --> 01:17.600
right, can everyone see the board? No one can see the board, I need to write way bigger.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.800
I need to write way bigger, this is not big enough for the board.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.040
Wow, now I understand what you guys always say with the font, right?

01:31.200 --> 01:35.120
We're just gonna write the word meaning, big letters, right?

01:37.600 --> 01:45.040
Everybody suffers from this, right? You think, you think, oh, oh, did I spell it right? Yeah, meaning,

01:46.000 --> 01:55.920
right? It's not a crisis of skill issue, right, and a crisis of meaning is actually incredibly

01:55.920 --> 02:02.960
stupid when you think about it, like, you know, I think about it, I was in New York for the weekend,

02:02.960 --> 02:03.920
I'm thinking about this.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.800
My markers, you don't like my marker, okay, we got lots of markers to choose from, thank you, thank

02:16.800 --> 02:21.600
you, you know what, guys, I'm not gonna wear black anymore, you know, I always dress in black,

02:21.600 --> 02:25.600
I think I'm gonna bleach my hair blonde and I'm gonna wear brightly colored clothes,

02:25.600 --> 02:31.040
not brightly colored, but like white, you know, because it's time, the tides are turning,

02:31.840 --> 02:38.400
it is, it is 2024 and the tides are turning, we thought that marker was bad, this marker is

02:38.400 --> 02:45.360
even worse, someday they will invent good markers, I like big shirts, you know,

02:50.080 --> 02:53.600
no, it's the other way around, bro, the Fs are white, the zeros are black, come on,

02:54.240 --> 03:01.440
um, wear earth colors, no, it's not about the meaning of life, right, but you guys know that

03:01.440 --> 03:05.760
I'm not kidding, when I say what is the meaning of life, right, and there really is only one

03:05.760 --> 03:15.520
answer that makes any sense, and that's to win, right, that's it, win, no one can see anything,

03:15.520 --> 03:24.000
this board doesn't work, it's too shiny, okay, so, um,

03:27.760 --> 03:36.960
how do you win, right, so I just like, like, like here we are, look around, right, you are in an

03:36.960 --> 03:46.640
open world, MMORPG, right, here you are with all these people, now, how do you win at World of

03:46.640 --> 03:55.120
Warcraft, how do you win at Zelda, right, how do you win it, wow, how do you win at Zelda,

03:55.680 --> 04:02.080
right, why do you think it's different, why, and this is what, what just comes to me about

04:02.080 --> 04:09.600
the crisis of meaning being so incredibly stupid, it's like, have you had a crisis of meaning in

04:09.600 --> 04:14.160
Zelda ever, right, what am I even solving these shrines for, you know, okay, I guess it's nice,

04:14.160 --> 04:18.320
I guess it's nice that you can, you can click that button and it says at the top, you know,

04:18.320 --> 04:24.480
destroy Calamity Ganon, right, I'm going to stop saying right, I realize I say right at the end

04:24.480 --> 04:30.160
of things and it's bad, and I'm not going to do that anymore, because it's a new year, it's 2024,

04:30.160 --> 04:36.480
even though you can't see it and it's in green marker, when it felt real,

04:40.000 --> 04:47.040
I understand that, but what do you think feels real anymore, I go to New York every year and the

04:47.040 --> 04:54.240
things that used to feel real don't feel real anymore either, we can't go back, we can only go forward,

04:54.720 --> 05:01.120
only forward, not back,

05:04.560 --> 05:10.160
so you have no problem with this objective in World of Warcraft and Zelda, and there's

05:10.160 --> 05:14.240
lots of different things you can do in these games, you can, you can join a guild, you can go

05:14.240 --> 05:23.520
gather mushrooms in the forests, but you don't have a crisis of meaning in these games and why not,

05:24.560 --> 05:30.640
why do you have a crisis of meaning in this world, but not there, I'm sorry the game is hard,

05:30.640 --> 05:40.880
I'm sorry the game takes a really long time to beat, I can't tell you how to quit procrastination,

05:41.760 --> 05:50.880
just the world, okay, can everybody, Harvard, can everybody read this because we're going to put

05:50.960 --> 05:58.000
a big no sign for it, these people have led us wrong for the last 50 years, for the last 50 years

05:58.000 --> 06:03.840
we've been listening to idiots, we don't have to listen to them anymore, Harvard's over, we're free,

06:06.880 --> 06:07.200
um,

06:11.040 --> 06:18.800
no we don't, we don't, there has been a group of people since, since, we'll put the year up here,

06:18.800 --> 06:25.680
since 1971, that has been, you know, the year the money became fake, this is when everything

06:25.680 --> 06:29.600
seemed to go awry, and we just don't have to listen to them anymore,

06:34.880 --> 06:39.040
can I draw my best integral sign, go, you're the reason we're going to go subscribe only,

06:39.840 --> 06:45.360
uh, no, no, no, no, don't trust me, but this is the problem now, okay, so we destroy Harvard,

06:45.360 --> 06:50.000
right, everyone, everyone, everyone loves being, it was at Robespierre, everyone loves being the guy

06:50.000 --> 06:54.720
who's going to, you know, storm the Bastille and kill the Nobles, but the question is what do we

06:54.720 --> 07:00.800
replace it with, you, you can't replace this with a bunch of Hackney conspiracy theories and

07:00.800 --> 07:09.360
libertarianism and, and, and whatever, you can't do that, you need to come up with a new,

07:09.840 --> 07:16.960
uh, epistemology, sort of, I mean, not really, like, it's, it's been there the whole time,

07:17.840 --> 07:23.360
it's been there the whole time, it brings me back to this point, which is how do we win?

07:25.600 --> 07:33.440
So, you've played, you've played Breath of the Wild, right, some of you have, you know what

07:33.440 --> 07:38.720
you're on, that little island with the four, you get the four shrines and, and, uh,

07:43.600 --> 07:47.520
you get the four shrines and then you get your paraglider and you can leave the little island,

07:47.520 --> 07:53.360
look at the universe, we haven't even left the little island yet, here, here, here is, here is

07:53.360 --> 08:02.240
Earth, Earth, right, and here's a sun over here, right, and like space is like, like we'll make

08:02.240 --> 08:06.400
it a little bigger because it's the sun, right, and like space is like that big, guys,

08:09.520 --> 08:14.160
um, or to be fair, there's not going to be beautiful little quests in every corner of space,

08:14.160 --> 08:21.840
this game is harder than that, reality is a hard game, it's not, not to scale, not to scale, not

08:22.800 --> 08:33.920
to scale, okay, so we're going to talk about a few, uh, its name is Sol, okay fine, fine, fine,

08:33.920 --> 08:38.080
Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol, that's, that's, that's, that's like the, that's like the name, we'll put Alpha

08:38.080 --> 08:46.880
Centauri over here, does that, does that, Alpha, a little Alpha Centauri goes over here, I don't

08:46.960 --> 08:51.440
know how to spell that, but you know, it's like, like, like, isn't that Connie's new girl, Centauri,

08:51.440 --> 09:00.800
Centauri, something like that, um, not to scale, uh,

09:05.680 --> 09:12.160
it's, it's not, it's not, it's not appreciate, so let's talk about a few ways that technology's

09:12.160 --> 09:17.120
actually going to start to improve your life again, um, so for the 2010s,

09:18.160 --> 09:24.800
I just listened to Jim Rott's Corey Doctorow, for the 2010s, tech was synonymous with this group

09:24.800 --> 09:31.440
called fame, okay, most of these companies are not technology companies, and if they do technology,

09:31.440 --> 09:36.160
it is mostly kind of as an aside, right, like there's some interesting stuff happening at Meta,

09:36.160 --> 09:40.480
interesting stuff happening at Apple, interesting stuff happening at Google, Amazon's a logistics

09:40.480 --> 09:49.040
company, Netflix is a stated media company, um, but this is not technology, and you shouldn't

09:49.040 --> 09:54.480
associate that, uh, when you think technology, the best thing to think about is farming,

09:55.520 --> 10:01.600
right, you guys watch, you know what's cool, Clarkson's farm, Clarkson's farm,

10:03.920 --> 10:08.080
farming is the best thing to think about, because humans have been growing food for

10:08.640 --> 10:17.600
many, many, many years, and oh man, if those, if those, if those first agricultural guys who were

10:17.600 --> 10:25.840
trying to get like a mule to pull a plow saw a tractor, oh they flip a shit man, y'all a big tractor

10:25.840 --> 10:30.720
coming through the field, you know, tilling all the soil, planting all the seeds, right, chopping

10:31.680 --> 10:44.640
man, they flip a shit, so can anybody sit right here now and say that things have not gotten better?

10:47.360 --> 10:52.480
And yeah, there's some, there's some great like, like crisis of meaning stuff, all things used to

10:52.480 --> 10:58.400
have meaning, used to have to rely on a neighbor, things used to be better, dude, if you want things

10:58.400 --> 11:04.080
to be better like that, leave America, you can, you can go, you know, I love watching these, this

11:04.080 --> 11:09.200
is, this is YouTube or best documentaries, and you watch Africa documentaries, I love Africa

11:09.200 --> 11:13.680
documentaries, you can see right now, if you want to go live in a world where people still need

11:13.680 --> 11:20.320
each other and food's hard to get, and there's a sense of community and tribalism, you can go to

11:20.320 --> 11:27.200
Africa and live this life, right, if you want to, I said right, I gotta stop doing that, um, but

11:27.280 --> 11:31.840
like, do you want to be, you can opt out, you can opt out at any point, the Luddites can opt out,

11:32.880 --> 11:40.800
but for most people, come on, let's be real here, do you want to be pulling the plow or do you want

11:40.800 --> 11:47.280
the tractor? Um, I don't want to rely on any, yeah, it's true, it's true, like something's lost,

11:47.280 --> 11:51.440
right, I'm no, I'm not a technology guy, I'm not a philosophy guy, you know, and it's a shame that

11:51.440 --> 11:56.960
philosophy guys all came from, you know, terrible institutions like this, there are smart ways to

11:56.960 --> 12:01.440
think about philosophy, you just don't see much of them, there are, there is a real liberal arts

12:01.440 --> 12:07.920
education out there, but unfortunately, we are a lost generation, unfortunately, for the last

12:07.920 --> 12:14.800
50 years, what has been called liberal arts is nothing of the sort, what you will get in a liberal

12:14.800 --> 12:23.440
arts, you know, hey ho, hey ho, western culture's gotta go, come on, right, and it's not, it hasn't

12:23.440 --> 12:28.320
gone anywhere, it's still there, you can still find it, there's people out there, and I love when

12:28.320 --> 12:33.280
I meet them, people out there who are still incredibly educated on the humanities, but

12:34.080 --> 12:39.280
these, these, these, these neo-Marxists, like, you know, I've met some smart Marxists, I've met

12:39.280 --> 12:45.680
some smart Marxists, and you can, you can talk about Marx in, in, in smart ways, and it is true

12:45.680 --> 12:52.400
that they still do produce some decent Marxists, but I don't think Marxism's really the future,

12:52.400 --> 12:57.040
I think that it had some good points a while ago, we tried it, and hey, you know, we got the soviet

12:57.040 --> 13:18.800
union, all right, Marx was a Jew, so what, what, I'm streaming, what's up, what's up,

13:19.200 --> 13:24.640
I got COVID, you got COVID? Yeah. Oh, all right,

13:27.280 --> 13:40.080
uh, I'm streaming, do you want to bring me? Yeah, I'd love to, uh, all right, yeah, uh, yeah,

13:41.040 --> 13:46.000
should, should, should we go? No, I don't, I don't think it's fake COVID, oh yeah, the

13:46.000 --> 13:53.760
flu is just whatever, the flu is just whatever, uh, happens to be the, uh, the, the, the thing,

13:55.040 --> 13:58.240
that goes around, we call it the flu, we call it a cold, we call it whatever,

13:58.240 --> 14:04.800
coronavirus is a cold, uh, okay, I don't have COVID, um,

14:07.440 --> 14:12.160
let's not get distracted by that, we got distracted, let's, let's, let's go back to where we were,

14:12.720 --> 14:21.120
so yeah, there is a real liberal arts education out there, and I hope some of you, you know,

14:21.120 --> 14:24.800
only people who comment, you realize the internet commenters, always remember that the internet

14:24.800 --> 14:29.040
commenters are a very small subset of society, oh, I was commenting about your Marx as a Jew,

14:29.040 --> 14:35.200
so what man, come on, let's move past racism, it's 2024, and we can all agree that racism,

14:35.200 --> 14:40.080
especially, uh, systemic racism, like affirmative action, systematic, systemic,

14:40.080 --> 14:44.880
with the system does it, like affirmative action is evil, and there's no place for racism going

14:44.880 --> 14:49.280
forward, so let's, let's, let's stop doing that, right, um, and if you're not on board with the

14:49.280 --> 14:54.000
no racism, you can maybe go to Harvard, I think they like racism there, so, you know, maybe you'll

14:54.000 --> 15:01.920
fit in, maybe you'll fit in, um, Jews hate white, come on, stop with the racist shit, like it's

15:01.920 --> 15:07.600
still racist, it doesn't matter at all, white power, black power, wokeism, it's all racist,

15:07.680 --> 15:13.360
racism's stupid, okay, you want to win or not, you know, even, even, even, Link had to work with the,

15:13.360 --> 15:16.640
with those fish people, yeah, you had to work with the fish people, all right, all right,

15:16.640 --> 15:20.640
you're imagining it was racist against, but stop being racist, all right, can everyone, can everyone

15:20.640 --> 15:28.480
stop being racist in 2024, that's a good, come in, oh, I know, I know, I know, we're telling everybody

15:28.480 --> 15:39.200
that there's no room for racism in 2024, you mean $135, well help yourself, help yourself to my pile

15:39.200 --> 15:50.480
of money, um, I have some in my wall too, I think, we're on stream right now, do you need

15:50.480 --> 15:54.560
just money right now, but it's like, it's like, Tony's brand, stop and buy, you want to shake his

15:54.560 --> 16:03.680
mouth, all right, I got some 20s here, but it's not that, no, I just, every time I get dollars,

16:03.680 --> 16:08.960
I put them in the pile over there, you want to, you want to show them my dollars, oh, here's some

16:08.960 --> 16:16.960
dollars, what is happening, you want some dollars, I got dollars, um, how upset will you be if I make

16:16.960 --> 16:22.960
it rain right now, wait, I wouldn't be upset, I'll pick it up, you'll pick it up, yeah, I'll make it rain!

16:24.960 --> 16:27.360
I mean, I have to feel bad for the guy, I have to count it all,

16:30.880 --> 16:36.880
he's been, I think, I came on a stripper, I always remember that we're having more fun than the other

16:36.880 --> 16:46.560
side, right, these cells having no fun, accelerationists have fun, uh, no, it's true though, it's true,

16:46.560 --> 16:51.200
I've learned this, I've learned this from, from protests, right, like, you look protests,

16:51.200 --> 16:56.160
you know, like the leftist protest used to have the energy and who's ever got the energy, but can

16:56.160 --> 17:02.000
we have a protest where we, we stop, like, I don't know, you know what, you know what infuriated me

17:02.000 --> 17:06.240
last night, I watched that video about housing in Japan and it turns out we really are just all

17:06.240 --> 17:11.920
getting scammed, like there's no reason housing should be expensive, this is a deliberate policy

17:11.920 --> 17:16.720
made up by people who own real estate to make their real estate bags that are expensive, it's

17:16.720 --> 17:24.240
just a scam, uh, and like, you all are affected by this scam, my rent for this apartment is $4,000,

17:24.720 --> 17:29.840
that's insane, get this in Tokyo for a, a grand,

17:32.160 --> 17:33.840
no, um,

17:36.960 --> 17:41.920
I'm sorry if you're a homeowner, but your bags are gonna tank bro, get out, get out while you can,

17:41.920 --> 17:49.440
no legit, if you are in this scam, get out today, I'm warning you right now, Michael Burry's tweeting

17:49.440 --> 17:54.880
it, yo man, uh, you guys know who Michael Burry is, right, um,

18:01.200 --> 18:05.040
now I'm not saying you gotta do protests, I'm saying you gotta be where the energy is,

18:05.040 --> 18:10.640
who's ever having a good time wins the future and who's ever having a bad time loses the future,

18:11.600 --> 18:12.160
uh,

18:15.600 --> 18:19.680
wait, no, but the housing market's actually gonna crash, it's just a question of when

18:20.480 --> 18:24.880
perception is reality until it's not and the market can remain irrational longer than you

18:24.880 --> 18:30.560
can remain solvent but not me, so, you know, I want to print an mRNA at home too, that's right,

18:30.560 --> 18:32.480
um,

18:36.640 --> 18:41.360
you've heard this shit for decades now, yes, but let me tell you what is different this time,

18:42.000 --> 18:47.600
okay, there is one thing that changes, does anyone know what that one thing is?

18:47.600 --> 19:03.440
Not Bitcoin technology, okay, what does it take to build a house? What if we just had a machine

19:04.080 --> 19:14.400
that could print houses? It's, like, there's a great, I think it's a, it's a Hayek quote at the

19:14.400 --> 19:21.040
end of the, uh, you know, the WTF happened in 1971 page, um, that says the only way that we're ever

19:21.040 --> 19:25.600
gonna make money real again is if we figure out how to make it something that they can't quite see

19:25.600 --> 19:32.160
is money, I'm sorry, they see Bitcoin as money, crypto failed, okay, now that doesn't mean that

19:32.160 --> 19:37.600
technology is going to fail but this, this, this, this, like, oh, we're gonna get crypto in before

19:37.600 --> 19:43.200
they notice, I'm sorry, no, like imagine Uber took the path that Bitcoin took, right, Uber worked,

19:43.200 --> 19:47.840
Uber exists today because it turned out that all the congressmen were taking ubers to go to

19:47.840 --> 19:52.160
Congress, the congressmen are not using Bitcoin to buy coffees and they don't give a shit about

19:52.160 --> 19:58.240
crypto and until crypto people understand this, until crypto people understand how to make normal

19:58.240 --> 20:04.320
people depend on their thing, there's no future in crypto, okay, I say this all the time, like,

20:04.320 --> 20:09.680
you want to succeed in crypto, stop trying to make ZK snark bullshit and make triangle, it's like

20:09.680 --> 20:14.720
square but you can pay decentralized with crypto, right, and you know, you can, there's a lot of,

20:14.720 --> 20:17.760
I think there's actually a lot of energy like this in New York, I love New York, you pay for

20:17.760 --> 20:22.160
everything, the cash, it works, right, and they all have, they all have signs that say 4% fee for

20:22.160 --> 20:26.800
credit cards, I love that, I mean you have to pass it on to the consumer, the consumer has to feel

20:26.800 --> 20:40.560
the pain of those merchant fees, check out DIMO, no, yeah, yeah, this is unfortunate,

20:40.560 --> 20:44.080
but this is what your bags and housing are going to look like if you don't get out,

20:46.320 --> 20:51.120
this is what your money is going to look like if you are a socialist, oh no, this is India,

20:51.120 --> 20:53.280
democracy, yeah, that's what happens if you do democracy,

20:56.320 --> 21:00.400
so when someone was angry at my last video saying I embrace fascists, oh Peter Thiel,

21:00.400 --> 21:06.880
who's the fascist man, I took it crazy to me, that's like, man, you want to like give people

21:06.880 --> 21:11.760
freedom and make things cheap, that's fascist man, you can't just do that, right, like we need like

21:11.760 --> 21:16.000
one world government in surveillance state so we can save democracy, all right,

21:21.680 --> 21:26.800
um, we don't need another war, can we do this without war, come on, World War III is actually

21:26.800 --> 21:30.160
going to suck guys, like you think it's going to be cool and you think it's going to be some

21:30.160 --> 21:38.320
call duty ship, but like it's not, okay, it's just going to suck, everyone's at ist now,

21:39.280 --> 21:44.320
how many houses just like family owned, yo, 100% inheritance tax, who's on board,

21:44.320 --> 21:50.480
you got to build yourself up, a war is kind of essential, I'm not an anti-war, I'm not pro-war,

21:51.200 --> 21:54.960
I think that war is appropriate in certain circumstances,

22:01.120 --> 22:05.680
World War III, I mean, I love cold wars, cold wars are the best, cold wars are the best possible

22:05.680 --> 22:11.680
outcome of wars, nobody dies when technology gets better, I love the US, China cold war,

22:11.680 --> 22:16.160
maybe we can have AI skirmishes where drones destroy each other over the pacific ocean,

22:16.160 --> 22:18.560
now that's my kind of war, right, we can get behind that,

22:21.600 --> 22:27.040
no, warm wars sucked in the kind that, the worst kind of war, like World War II was awful, okay,

22:27.040 --> 22:31.680
and the worst kind of war is a war that wants to get the citizenry involved, right, like a total

22:31.680 --> 22:36.640
war where your citizenry have to contribute to the stupid war effort sucks, okay, none of us want

22:36.640 --> 22:43.920
to live through that, a nice war between US and China where we like fight over some uninhabited

22:43.920 --> 22:50.480
island to just like a tech pissing contest, that sounds sick man, like that's the kind of war we

22:50.480 --> 22:57.120
want in the future, okay, it's not like nice war, right, it's an understanding that both sides could

22:57.120 --> 23:01.200
nuke each other and turn everybody into rubble, right, we sort of do this with proxy wars,

23:01.200 --> 23:05.440
it's a little upsetting that people still have to die, imagine we had proxy wars where we just

23:05.440 --> 23:12.480
sent robots, and we can all agree to some Geneva 2.0 convention where we all just send robots to war

23:12.480 --> 23:22.160
and anyone who sends people to war is a terrorist, how about that, tech bro wants war, no I do,

23:22.160 --> 23:29.040
I do want that kind of war though, I think every year we should have drone combat with China over

23:29.840 --> 23:35.440
to take control of an uninhabited island, rules, you can't send people, and maybe there's a,

23:35.440 --> 23:39.360
no no there's not to be a budget cap, it's like the olympic games but with technology,

23:39.360 --> 23:45.040
I think that'd be sick, that's a huge waste of resources bro, bro what are we gonna do,

23:45.040 --> 23:49.920
help poor people in Somalia, come on, come on, drone war sounds sick, George you can't do that,

23:49.920 --> 23:56.880
that's fascist, okay, well that's like your opinion man, that's my new phrase for like

23:57.840 --> 24:03.040
that's like your opinion man, I think it's from the Big Lebowski, I think it's good, war on the moon,

24:03.040 --> 24:10.240
let's go, right, the thing about the moon is almost everything you do to it improves the place,

24:10.240 --> 24:18.720
you explode a nuclear bomb on the moon, I bet it gets better, have I seen for all mankind,

24:18.800 --> 24:22.560
nah what's that, is that like seven genes, true religion,

24:27.120 --> 24:32.480
space rays, except you can shoot at other spaces, no no no no, let's have the pvp zones of space

24:32.480 --> 24:37.520
and the pve zones of space, I'm not saying that about crypto right, like we like that, that'd be cool,

24:38.480 --> 24:48.240
uh no no no, I did like her to think about it, but you know I think we're gonna we're gonna

24:48.240 --> 24:53.200
compliment Mark Andreessen, I think I think Mark Andreessen does bring up a really good point

24:53.200 --> 25:01.920
about these sort of radical uh radical uh Luddites and if they really believe that this

25:01.920 --> 25:06.640
technology is going to destroy the world, if you are going to destroy the world and you think

25:06.640 --> 25:10.080
you know if you really think that your neighbor is working on a project that's going to destroy the

25:10.080 --> 25:13.760
world, killing your neighbor is the right thing to do right and they're going to become violent,

25:14.960 --> 25:18.560
you know hopefully not, hopefully they see the light before they do, but I think this is one

25:18.560 --> 25:23.280
of the smartest things Andreessen said and it is uh sadly something we have to watch out for,

25:23.280 --> 25:36.160
but the good news is we have drones and they do not, um I am a Christian, uh look guys

25:37.440 --> 25:48.000
yeah, all right, um I can't believe I was duped into atheism, but also evolution is real,

25:49.120 --> 25:56.000
so yeah like Christianity, I can see, I do sort of see a bit of a resurgence of Christianity among

25:56.800 --> 26:03.200
younger people, I'm a Christian, I believe in evolution, uh my belief in evolution does come

26:03.280 --> 26:08.400
above my Christianity right, so so if you say you can't, you know, if you say Jesus didn't

26:08.400 --> 26:14.240
die for your sins if you believe in evolution, well that's like your opinion man, uh so but no

26:14.240 --> 26:20.160
when it comes down to a lot of the, again wokeism really showed me the importance of Christianity

26:20.160 --> 26:24.880
and the importance of forgiveness, wokeism is original sin without forgiveness uh and we can't

26:24.880 --> 26:30.560
have that, we have original sin but we have forgiveness okay, that's Christianity, I like it

26:30.560 --> 26:34.240
everyone should get on board, it's a nice religion, we love everybody, come to a church,

26:35.040 --> 26:38.320
I don't know church is kind of boring, someone's got to make cool churches, actually the churches

26:38.320 --> 26:43.120
in the south are cool, if I lived in the south by like one of them like, I went to like Seacoast

26:43.120 --> 26:48.560
church in South Carolina, and it was good and I'd probably go every sunday, uh you know the the

26:50.400 --> 26:54.960
the low-budget Catholic church doesn't, doesn't, doesn't draw me in every weekend, not not hate and

26:54.960 --> 26:59.520
it just doesn't draw me in every weekend, uh the rock bands are cool right, like I think this is

26:59.520 --> 27:04.480
good, I think that like all right fine, they finally caught up to the 1970s but I would love to see a

27:04.480 --> 27:10.240
resurgence of the church, uh that a church that embraces technology, because if you do not embrace

27:10.240 --> 27:18.880
technology you will lose, how do you, how do these people who say they don't like tech, like do they

27:18.880 --> 27:24.480
have a sustainable plan for the future, do they have like like have they thought about what the

27:24.480 --> 27:29.280
future is going to look like, people who don't like tech are like conservatives, uh conservatives

27:29.280 --> 27:33.520
we're gonna rip on conservatives, everybody knows conservatives suck, uh the kind of conservatives

27:33.520 --> 27:38.560
who like in the 90s really didn't like gay marriage, and today they really don't like trans people,

27:38.560 --> 27:43.600
right, but gay marriage is fine, and then in 20 years, well trans people are fine but we have to

27:43.600 --> 27:48.640
do something about pedophiles, right, like, like, like, like it's gonna be, these conservatives

27:48.640 --> 27:55.520
are always losing because they have no principles, it's just a backlash, a backlash to the backlash

27:55.520 --> 28:04.320
to the thing that's just begun, right, so don't, uh, don't be a conservative, don't be a Luddite,

28:04.320 --> 28:09.760
unless you like losing, who's the worst, who's the worst football team in the NFL, I was saying this,

28:10.400 --> 28:17.600
I was saying this to a friend yesterday, uh, you know, there's some people who just, I gotta stop

28:17.600 --> 28:21.440
saying you know, and I gotta stop saying, right, I'm self-aware about this stuff, right, you know,

28:22.080 --> 28:29.280
uh, the Jets aren't pedos always better, I don't like pedos, but like, again, oh, I don't want to

28:29.280 --> 28:41.680
get into this, come on, let's, let's, let's, uh, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's not get into

28:41.680 --> 28:46.160
this, but I think there is a destination of where this stuff goes, and it can just, culture

28:46.160 --> 28:51.840
or stupid, the culture or stupid, there's only one war that matters, and that's, are you on the side

28:51.840 --> 28:59.200
of technology, or are you against technology, this is the new dividing line, this is the new

28:59.200 --> 29:05.760
dividing line in society, we don't have, uh, conservatives and liberals anymore, we have

29:05.760 --> 29:17.600
excel and desal, okay, desal and excel, and which side are you on, are you on this side,

29:17.600 --> 29:26.320
or are you on this side, now this side is conservative, so we'll give them a C,

29:27.840 --> 29:33.680
all right, and this side is progressive, we'll give them a P, and if you've been listening to the

29:33.680 --> 29:39.760
last five minutes, you realize that the C's always lose and the P's always win, so do you want to root

29:39.760 --> 29:44.640
for the Oakland Raiders, or do you want to root for the Patriots when they still had Tom Brady,

29:44.640 --> 29:54.160
look it's a P, right, so it is kind of still conservatives and liberals, but this is really

29:54.160 --> 30:01.680
the dividing line, now look, embracing technology does not mean embracing every single piece of

30:01.680 --> 30:06.000
every single technology, and it's all good even if there's negative effects, that's not what it means,

30:07.120 --> 30:13.680
that's not what it means, I think the most pure way to distill this down, and every metric can

30:13.680 --> 30:20.080
still be perverted, every metric can be perverted, good heart's law, but I think the most pure way

30:20.080 --> 30:29.440
to look at it is energy use, this is energy use up, and this is energy use minus, do we want to use

30:29.440 --> 30:35.440
more energy in the future, or do we want to use less energy in the future, humans, population,

30:36.480 --> 30:41.520
do we want there to be more humans in the future, more than less humans in the future,

30:41.520 --> 30:46.080
some people might put a plus there and still be conservatives, but really it's all the same thing,

30:46.640 --> 30:51.360
energy use in humans, what's the difference, humans use a lot of energy, well you can't use the

30:51.440 --> 30:58.400
energy for that, no, right, are you a progressive or are you a conservative,

31:00.000 --> 31:03.440
are there people out there who are conservatives, and I don't mean to hate on the individual who's

31:03.440 --> 31:08.400
a conservative, the conservative who wants to be left alone and live their own lifestyle, we need

31:08.400 --> 31:13.040
to totally respect that, I totally respect the person who doesn't want to allow the new technology

31:13.040 --> 31:18.240
into their lives, and that's fine, you can, and you should, you should be left alone, and that's

31:18.240 --> 31:23.440
the moral duty of these people, the moral duty of these people is to people who want to be left

31:23.440 --> 31:27.440
alone, people who don't want the technology to come for them, it absolutely should not come for

31:27.440 --> 31:32.800
them, people should totally be able to opt out of this, otherwise you're just asking for a fight,

31:34.080 --> 31:39.600
and I think that's a real, I think that's a mistake that the current progressives make,

31:39.600 --> 31:46.480
so if you want to opt out you can opt out, what you cannot do is prevent this, if you're on this

31:46.480 --> 31:51.360
side and you want to exist, that's fine, but if you're on this side and you want to try to stop

31:51.360 --> 31:56.240
this, that's where we have a problem, and these are the people who need to be soundly defeated in

31:56.240 --> 32:04.880
every poll, in every ballot, in every democracy, in every war, in every everything, war is the

32:04.880 --> 32:10.720
fundamental decider, we don't, doesn't have to come to war, let's hope it doesn't have to come to

32:10.720 --> 32:15.520
war, let's hope these people realize that if you don't embrace technology you lose, and you don't

32:15.520 --> 32:21.600
even have to fight, now let's give them good surrender terms, let them surrender peacefully,

32:22.320 --> 32:26.960
let them live out life on their farm, let them reproduce, this is animal conservation,

32:26.960 --> 32:34.400
it's the same thing, we like animal conservation, we're progressives, all right, so everybody,

32:35.840 --> 32:42.160
in 2024 welcome to the progressive team, welcome to the accelerationist team, we love technology,

32:42.160 --> 32:48.720
we want to see more humans, we want to see flourishing, we don't want to see deceleration,

32:48.720 --> 32:53.600
we don't want to see housing not being built, we don't want to see power plants being knocked down,

32:53.600 --> 32:58.320
we don't want to see one child policies, we don't see anything that looks like this,

32:58.320 --> 33:02.560
it's negative, it's negative, got got positive energy over here, see I'm not dressing in black

33:02.560 --> 33:08.000
anymore, it's time, it's time the future is ours, wow, is this, is this, is this just me with the

33:08.480 --> 33:15.680
same accelerationist and recent manifesto, come on, so coming back to here, coming back to meaning,

33:18.560 --> 33:24.880
look, what is the existentialism of the 21st century, I don't know, I'm not that great at

33:24.880 --> 33:31.120
liberal arts, I'm not, I'm a good programmer, I'm a good security guy, I'm not, I like the stuff,

33:31.120 --> 33:37.120
I'm a hobbyist, but when I meet people who are genuinely good at this stuff, the people who know

33:37.440 --> 33:41.840
all of the Sart books and the Camus books, the people who've actually read like,

33:42.400 --> 33:47.680
like being in time and who are like, I understand it, what was on my book, Kant's, what's Kant's,

33:49.680 --> 33:55.360
oh, critique of pure reason, like the people who've actually read critique of pure reason,

33:55.360 --> 34:01.520
I just, I can't do it, but there's people out there who have, and this is a, this is a serious

34:01.520 --> 34:06.640
role in the future for this, figure out what the existentialism of the 21st century is,

34:07.680 --> 34:13.680
I don't know, I don't know, but there's answers here, and the closest I can come is thinking about

34:13.680 --> 34:19.920
winning, I don't mean winning over other people, I mean winning over nature, we are in this great

34:20.720 --> 34:31.200
open world universe and, well, do we want to win or lose, let's win, you could stand in the same

34:31.200 --> 34:35.120
place, you could, you could play Zelda, you could just stand there, but why would we do that,

34:35.120 --> 34:38.560
you could play your little, you could play your little minigame, go around, catch horses, buy

34:38.560 --> 34:42.720
that one stable all day, but why would we do that, let's progress, let's get to the end of the game,

34:47.360 --> 34:50.960
we're gonna be tired of winning, we're gonna win so much, we're gonna be tired of winning,

34:52.480 --> 34:59.920
Jesus, Trump 5 in 2024, what a, what a sad, what a sad state, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't

35:00.640 --> 35:03.360
matter, this is the new line, this is the new line,

35:06.640 --> 35:09.440
you're either on this team or you're on this team,

35:12.560 --> 35:18.640
all right, and no racism, okay, I don't see any racism, 2024, if you want to be racist,

35:18.640 --> 35:23.840
go to Harvard, okay, they gotta, they gotta, let them, let them have racism, and you know,

35:23.840 --> 35:28.960
they can, they can be stuck in 1971 and, and you know, let them have racism,

35:31.920 --> 35:42.400
Charlie Schumann's out of his time, Harvard is racist, yes, yes, they are, they are,

35:43.280 --> 35:48.480
they have, they, they, so, so look, let's just come up with a very simple definition of racism,

35:49.040 --> 35:54.960
if you are looking at people's race, if you are making decisions based on people's race,

35:54.960 --> 36:01.920
you are a racist, pretty straightforward, right, so if Harvard looks at people's race,

36:01.920 --> 36:08.880
when they decide who to admit, they are racist, and because Harvard is a powerful corporation,

36:08.880 --> 36:14.480
that's systemic racism, okay, should I, should I teach, should I teach impression studies,

36:14.480 --> 36:22.000
does everyone like this, systemic racism, when a government or a large corporation

36:22.000 --> 36:33.680
uses race to discriminate, systemic racism, is a doctor racist then, a doctor doesn't use that

36:33.680 --> 36:38.720
to discriminate, right, if a doctor were to look at someone's race and charge them a different

36:38.720 --> 36:44.800
amount based on their race, sure, if, if you, you, race affects your medical, yeah, but come on,

36:44.800 --> 36:50.080
we live in a society, we live in a Christian society where we're all equal under God, okay,

36:50.720 --> 36:59.040
everybody has the same moral value to God, now, that doesn't mean that everyone's going to have

36:59.040 --> 37:03.840
the same stuff, that's just, that's just the economy, that's just, we live in a free world,

37:03.840 --> 37:08.240
you make, you make choices, you, you have free will, you also unfortunately are somewhat trapped

37:08.240 --> 37:13.120
to your genetics, but that's just life, sometimes the ball comes up red, sometimes the ball comes up

37:13.120 --> 37:18.880
black, should we make roulette illegal, no, but we should remove the zeros from the wheels,

37:18.880 --> 37:24.160
one zero is plenty, three zeros is really egregious, and someone needs to do something about this,

37:24.160 --> 37:36.320
is all racism bad, I think so, okay, now, I do think race does correlate with certain

37:36.320 --> 37:41.520
things that you may want to discriminate based on, you may want to discriminate based on culture,

37:41.520 --> 37:46.400
you may want to live around people who have similar values to you, this is all very different,

37:46.400 --> 37:54.640
and this is not racism, racism is literally, racism is asking the question, what race are you,

37:54.640 --> 38:03.040
this is not a real category, this is bullshit, it singles out a few pieces of DNA that don't,

38:03.680 --> 38:11.040
this is your color, your skin, come on man, this is, we are progressives here, we have moved past

38:11.440 --> 38:14.880
this, okay, racism is over, it's back at Harvard,

38:18.960 --> 38:24.000
how do we build the protect future, I mean, it's not going to be easy and it's not going to happen

38:24.000 --> 38:28.960
overnight, there's going to be a big struggle, okay, so let's get, let's move fast, racism is a

38:28.960 --> 38:35.280
stupid topic, let's move to a good topic, okay, housing, right, this is Peter Teal's thesis and

38:35.280 --> 38:41.120
I've come to believe that it's very true, if we can fix housing we can fix a lot of other problems

38:41.120 --> 38:46.080
in society, so housing you basically have two groups, you have land owners

38:48.960 --> 38:57.360
and then the renters, I mean I'm in this class, so we have two classes, now let's say rents were to

38:57.360 --> 39:06.800
come down 75%, the renters would be happy but the landowner class, the homeowner class would be

39:06.800 --> 39:20.240
unhappy, their bads would become smaller, look, you got to give them a way out, you got to give

39:20.240 --> 39:24.000
them a way out, I don't know what that's going to be, I hope people smarter than me or at least

39:24.000 --> 39:28.800
thinking about this more than me are working on this because you do have to give them a bag out

39:28.800 --> 39:36.000
that this is what needs to happen, you're going to get continued very strong opposition from this

39:36.000 --> 39:47.600
class, this is why this won't happen but if we figure out how to either satiate, swindle, whatever

39:47.600 --> 39:53.360
it is we do to this class, I don't know, I'm all for diplomatic solutions here but something's

39:53.360 --> 39:58.480
got to be done, this is class warfare, this is Marxism 101, they really try to distract you with

39:58.480 --> 40:05.440
race is bullshit but we are the 99% boys, we are the 99% and something's got to be done about the

40:05.440 --> 40:09.360
damn landowners gouging everybody because they don't just gouge everybody by charging a lot for

40:09.360 --> 40:13.600
their properties, they vote in elections and then they make it illegal to the more housing,

40:14.480 --> 40:19.200
basically, I hope everyone understands this now and hope everyone sees that it doesn't have to be

40:19.200 --> 40:26.000
this way, I think the simplest way to get people out of this and into this is to show them that the

40:26.000 --> 40:32.480
future can be better than the present, if you live in a world where we're in pretty much decline

40:32.480 --> 40:39.280
since 1971, it's hard for them to believe that the future can be better than the present, look up,

40:39.280 --> 40:43.040
look up, trust in the US government, look up trust in the US government, peek to Kennedy and it's

40:43.040 --> 40:47.920
gone downhill since, little spiked Reagan, little spiked Clinton but mostly it's gone downhill since

40:50.160 --> 40:55.280
we need to convince people things can be better and they can, thanks to technology

40:56.240 --> 41:01.760
because everyone can agree that attractor is a lot better than plowing the field yourself

41:03.760 --> 41:09.120
so eat the rich, I love it, I love it, let's team up with AOC, we got to get AOC on this team,

41:09.120 --> 41:14.400
right, we got to, how do we get AOC on this team, we can do it because these are the good guys

41:20.160 --> 41:23.440
I know Uncle Ted wouldn't agree but like

41:29.760 --> 41:37.200
it's not good, it's not good, we got to move past that, we got to move past that ridiculous way

41:37.200 --> 41:41.520
of thinking that somehow meaning is being stripped from the world, all right let's talk about, let's

41:41.600 --> 41:49.520
talk about, let's talk about Ted Kicinski, right, guy love nature, wild nature, guy did not like

41:49.520 --> 41:54.480
uniform housing projects, I don't like uniform housing projects either, the things that we

41:54.480 --> 41:58.720
can build in the future look more like nature, there's a pirate wires article about this,

42:00.160 --> 42:07.760
we can, the reason that houses are boring beige boxes is because the manufacturing technologies

42:07.760 --> 42:14.080
of the last 100 years allow us to build boring beige boxes, as we get control of, as we can use

42:14.080 --> 42:21.120
ad-lib manufacturing technologies, as we can use biotech to build, that's the look at species 8472,

42:21.120 --> 42:27.920
that's the future, like a fusion of biology and the things in the future are going to look more

42:27.920 --> 42:35.280
like nature, not less like nature, we will exist in more harmony with nature, with more technology,

42:36.240 --> 42:43.120
things today are, when you think about, I just want you to imagine an appliance from the 1950s

42:43.120 --> 42:49.680
and how sketchy it looked, the thing was a fire hazard, the thing was, think about like a transformer

42:49.680 --> 42:54.640
and you're putting things through and your coils are vibrating at 60 hertz and it's scraping the

42:54.640 --> 43:01.920
enamel off the coils, now compare that to a MOSFET, think about it, think about a beautiful little

43:01.920 --> 43:08.880
tiny MOSFET, switching a kilowatt, you switch a kilowatt with a MOSFET, you know 50 volts 20 amps

43:08.880 --> 43:16.320
is a kilowatt, with a MOSFET, I don't know, it's the MOSFET symbol, now we'll draw the transistor,

43:18.320 --> 43:24.960
compare this, this is also not to scale, compare this to, oh what I gotta build a relay,

43:24.960 --> 43:30.320
what am I gonna do, build a relay, I'm gonna pull a magnet on here and then have like a little like

43:30.320 --> 43:42.720
electromagnetic coil here, oh, oh, the solid state, the technology gets us closer to like

43:43.520 --> 43:50.880
beautiful pure things, the relay and the transformer last a way shorter amount of time,

43:50.880 --> 43:54.880
I know that's not a MOSFET, what's the MOSFET, what's the MOSFET symbol, well you know what,

43:54.880 --> 43:59.520
I'm gonna label them gate drain and source, so therefore it is a MOSFET, there we go,

43:59.520 --> 44:09.920
take that electrical engineering, actually this is this, right, the drain is the emitter,

44:09.920 --> 44:25.440
the source is the collector, I don't know, is that right, I mean I think yeah because usually

44:25.440 --> 44:31.840
your drain is like, if you have like a, it depends, I think it depends if it's n-type or p-type,

44:37.360 --> 44:44.880
yeah, we could go into, but it's this stuff, I was watching a, you watched a Superbowl

44:44.880 --> 44:57.040
from 1995, you watched like the Superbowl show and you look at these large halogen lamps that

44:57.040 --> 45:02.480
you can't switch on and off quickly, how would you even do that, how would you even switch it on

45:02.480 --> 45:12.240
and off quickly, today we have LEDs switched by MOSFETs, come on, that's cool, so drain,

45:12.240 --> 45:15.680
source and drain, it's gate, source and drain, we have three things, but I forget that one,

45:15.680 --> 45:20.000
that's this n-t-n because I do the arrow that way, p-n-p's the other way, I don't know, I come from

45:21.040 --> 45:31.840
pre-MOSFET, small transistor uses less energy, out arrow is n-type, yeah, okay,

45:31.840 --> 45:44.960
MOSFET and heat sink, yeah, but you need a tinier heat sink today,

45:45.600 --> 45:53.360
you need a tinier heat sink today than you do in the past because your, so MOSFET has a resistance

45:53.360 --> 45:59.200
here, you have, you have some, you have some basic like, like the model is that it's a semiconductor

45:59.360 --> 46:04.960
with some resistance, actually just resistance that matters, so you have some drain source

46:04.960 --> 46:11.200
resistance when your MOSFET's fully saturated and these things are becoming, this like, it's,

46:11.200 --> 46:18.880
I think it's beyond 99% efficient today, meaning that for every, for every, you want to switch

46:18.880 --> 46:23.760
a kilowatt, you only need to sink 10 watts, I bet there are even more, I bet there are even more

46:23.760 --> 46:29.760
than 99% efficient today, if we had computers we could look this stuff up, but the future is so

46:29.760 --> 46:41.040
bright, I agree, so this is a separate problem and we need real liberal arts majors to work on this,

46:41.040 --> 46:47.200
we need people who actually understand what, what was called the liberal arts for many, many years

46:47.200 --> 46:54.400
till it was perverted by a Marxist cult, right, is this controversial, I think, I think everyone

46:54.400 --> 47:05.360
kind of gets it now, um, what can us as engineers do, okay, stop and I say the same thing I always say,

47:06.480 --> 47:10.160
think about what you're working on and what the convergent endpoint of it is,

47:10.640 --> 47:17.280
think about where your technology is going and how your technology is going to change the world,

47:17.840 --> 47:23.040
what group of people is it going to benefit, is it going to benefit, if you are at a physics

47:23.040 --> 47:28.640
research lab researching MOSFET's with lower drain source resistance, you are doing good for the world,

47:29.440 --> 47:40.080
if you are working on a, you know, I don't have a name to have to give examples,

47:40.080 --> 47:43.520
you know the kind of things that I'm talking about, if you are working on,

47:44.800 --> 47:49.760
if you work at TurboTax and you are lobbying the IRS to make the tax code more complicated,

47:49.760 --> 47:55.680
that's my favorite example, but there's many forms of that, if you are working to slow down any of

47:55.680 --> 48:00.560
this technology, if you are the person who made Elon strap a seal to a board, you're the bad guy,

48:02.720 --> 48:07.840
so what can you as engineers do, I mean think about who you work for, do you work for people who

48:07.840 --> 48:12.960
look like this or do you work for people who look like this, a lot of these sort of people still

48:12.960 --> 48:19.360
want technology, the New York Times has somebody making their website, don't do that, the New York

48:19.360 --> 48:28.240
Times actually isn't that bad, but you know the ones who are bad, if they're not, if the ownership

48:28.240 --> 48:35.040
of your company is fundamentally against technology, stop working for them and start working for people

48:35.040 --> 48:39.360
who like technology and want the future to be better than the present,

48:40.160 --> 48:47.840
Yeah, Fang and John Deere are probably on the left side of the board,

48:51.200 --> 48:53.920
I mean I think, I don't look, I don't know that much about John Deere,

48:56.400 --> 49:03.680
for Fang companies, yeah I mean I wouldn't work at Google, I think Google is fairly anti-technology

49:03.680 --> 49:08.640
today, I think that it's less clear for companies like Amazon,

49:12.480 --> 49:18.160
well of course they were lion-tech and look, just like, just like welcome to the, you know,

49:18.160 --> 49:25.760
welcome to the, welcome to the, welcome to the 2020s, the lit 2020s, where we used to, people

49:25.760 --> 49:30.960
used to quit because they're, they're, you know, oh my company doesn't support, like my company

49:30.960 --> 49:35.840
isn't pro-choice, I'm going to quit the company, right, that's right, I respect these people right

49:35.840 --> 49:41.520
to stand up for what they believe in and all the engineers out there, you know, stand up for what

49:41.520 --> 49:51.040
you believe in, right, it's the same thing, but I think, you know, it's, it's, if your, if your

49:51.040 --> 49:58.000
company doesn't share a pro-technology set of values, stop working there, stop helping them with

49:58.000 --> 50:08.640
technology. Meta is, these companies are large, they have many different divisions, they have many

50:08.640 --> 50:21.760
different teams, I think that I can promise that all of my interactions with Elon match up to what

50:21.760 --> 50:28.320
you think Elon is. Elon seems to be complete, like there is no, there actually isn't a filter,

50:28.320 --> 50:34.240
how Elon behaves is what Elon is. I can't say the same thing about Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos,

50:34.240 --> 50:41.120
I'm not sure, I'm not saying that they're not, but what I'm saying is it's not completely obvious

50:41.120 --> 50:49.120
to me and see if you can find somebody who would vouch for them, you know, someone who's, someone who's,

50:49.200 --> 50:53.520
someone who spent time close with Mark Zuckerberg, does he actually believe the kind of stuff he's

50:53.520 --> 50:59.520
saying now? And then there's also a question of do these people have, you look at someone like

50:59.520 --> 51:04.640
Jack Dorsey on Twitter, it turns out Jack Dorsey was just cut out of everything on Twitter. So

51:04.640 --> 51:09.440
sometimes you might even have, the question is do they have control and do they have good values?

51:11.600 --> 51:16.480
So come on, we all learned, we all learned from the SJWs in the 2010s, some of their tactics are

51:16.480 --> 51:20.880
good, some of their tactics are good, don't announce them because they're SJW tactics,

51:20.880 --> 51:27.920
but always make sure that you are having fun and if you're not having fun, you're going to lose,

51:27.920 --> 51:31.440
right? If you, if you see this all as drudgery and this is what I said on Twitter, I'm like,

51:31.440 --> 51:36.640
if you don't love technology, quit technology, right, it's going to be a party and that's the

51:36.640 --> 51:40.800
kind of energy that was, I loved Occupy Wall Street back in the day, that's the kind of energy

51:40.800 --> 51:45.440
that, that, that, that works, that's sustainable. Everyone here is having a good time building

51:45.440 --> 51:58.000
the future. What's the name of this cult? It's not a cult and it's the future, the progressivism,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.760
it's progressivism, right? Progressivism, we believe in progress.

52:01.760 --> 52:11.920
We're boogieing, right? Electric Boogaloo, I love that, the Boogaloo boys.

52:13.920 --> 52:20.640
See, they're having a good time, man. How is Excel the good side if the doomers are right?

52:21.440 --> 52:26.000
What are the doomers right about? Everybody can say AI and they can say doom, okay?

52:26.960 --> 52:32.560
What exactly, how exactly does AI lead to doom? I was trying to get Yudkowski to explain it and

52:32.560 --> 52:37.360
it's just like convergent endpoint. You know what else a convergent endpoint is? The heat death of

52:37.360 --> 52:43.040
the universe, okay? The heat death of the universe is coming and if we have any chance of answering

52:43.040 --> 52:48.640
the last question, we need AI. So currently, we are on a trajectory to doom. I want everybody to

52:48.640 --> 52:53.360
remember that. You know, some people have those clocks that like, how long you have in your lifespan?

52:53.360 --> 52:56.000
Well, how long do we have before the heat death of the universe?

52:58.400 --> 53:03.680
Right? Right? I gotta stop saying that. I gotta stop saying that. I gotta stop my verbal tics.

53:03.680 --> 53:11.840
It's 2024. So it gets more than a few billion years, but the heat death of the universe is coming

53:12.640 --> 53:16.640
and in order to beat the heat death of the universe, we need AI. Maybe,

53:16.640 --> 53:18.880
maybe you can't beat the heat death of the universe. We don't really know.

53:23.760 --> 53:29.520
AI leads to doom when the government uses autonomous robocops.

53:32.080 --> 53:36.480
With all technology, there's challenges. With every technology in the past, with all this

53:36.480 --> 53:43.600
new surveillance technology that now exists, there are challenges. Is AI a pure unalloyed good?

53:43.600 --> 53:48.000
No. Is technology a pure unalloyed good? When you have a gun pointed at your head,

53:48.000 --> 53:54.960
you do not think technology is a pure unalloyed good, but on balance is technology good.

53:55.600 --> 54:04.320
And the answer is, I think obviously, with things like age back and cheap food and cars,

54:04.320 --> 54:08.720
and look like, I flew here, I just flew here on JetBlue from New York, right? I could talk

54:08.720 --> 54:16.000
shit about JetBlue, but imagine flying in that like right flyer too. At least that was on A321.

54:18.720 --> 54:23.520
I'm against progress of technology. They no longer provide benefits. That's not true.

54:24.960 --> 54:31.280
We are unfortunately, like you've been scammed by a group of people for the last 50 years.

54:31.280 --> 54:35.600
The reason things have gotten worse is largely not because of technology. I also just listened to

54:35.600 --> 54:46.480
Corey Doctorow on Jim Rutt's podcast. And like, we have been scammed largely through

54:46.480 --> 54:50.960
government inaction against these tech companies. I saw someone in the comments like, George,

54:50.960 --> 54:56.880
you don't even know you can download other browsers for iOS. I just, someone says something

54:56.880 --> 55:01.120
like that. I want you to think. I want you to think, do I not know how browsers work on iOS

55:01.120 --> 55:06.800
or are you wrong? When you download Chrome on iOS, it uses a web view, which is actually just Safari,

55:06.800 --> 55:13.520
because nothing else on iOS is allowed to mark pages RWX. RWX is a permission built into the

55:13.520 --> 55:19.680
kernel that only the Jits allowed to bypass. There is a 5% chance I'm out of date on that

55:19.680 --> 55:25.600
information, but I don't think so. Okay, so you'd think who you talking to, right? We went from

55:25.600 --> 55:32.240
a world where Microsoft couldn't bundle Internet Explorer with Windows without getting sued. And

55:32.240 --> 55:36.880
now we live in a world where Apple not only bundles Safari, but doesn't let you install anything else.

55:38.160 --> 55:43.360
So this is not due to technology. This is due to failure of government. This is due to regulatory

55:43.360 --> 55:50.800
capture. Technology itself. When you think of technology, don't think of Fang. Think of a

55:50.800 --> 55:57.680
MOSFET. A very simplistic model of a MOSFET. You put in a little current here and massive

55:57.680 --> 56:05.520
currents flow here. It's a switch. And that has changed. That's why everything's so small and

56:05.520 --> 56:12.000
good now. You have a phone that can charge. I got my phone charger around here. 67 watts.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
You're putting 67 watts into something this big. You think you can do that without MOSFET?

56:16.000 --> 56:23.200
You can use a transformer? So everybody, don't think of Fang when you think of technology. Think

56:23.200 --> 56:30.160
of the MOSFET. All right. That's where iOS is now for the Mac. Yeah, for the Mac actually,

56:30.160 --> 56:37.440
you can install it from web browsers. Thank you for watching today's stream. It's the end of 2023.
