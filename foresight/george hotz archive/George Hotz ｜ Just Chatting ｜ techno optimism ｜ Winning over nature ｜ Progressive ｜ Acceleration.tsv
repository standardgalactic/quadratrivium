0	14000	Welcome, welcome, welcome to my stream, hello everybody, our chair over here, we can sit
14000	20880	down, we're not really that visible though, we can maybe tilt it down a little, we're
20880	27760	gonna write on the whiteboard, let's wait for some people to get in here, oh good morning,
27920	30800	we don't subscribe, we're only chat, we don't need to subscribe, we're only chat, thank you for
30800	39280	subscribing. Is this setup working? We have the whiteboard today, no computer, only whiteboard.
44960	50320	I did a lot of thinking about the last stream, I did a lot of thinking about the
50640	59440	techno-peasantism argument for the last one, it was brought up in a few things and we can discuss
62880	72400	crisis of meaning, right, maybe you've heard this phrase, who thinks it's true,
73520	77600	right, can everyone see the board? No one can see the board, I need to write way bigger.
77760	82800	I need to write way bigger, this is not big enough for the board.
86080	89040	Wow, now I understand what you guys always say with the font, right?
91200	95120	We're just gonna write the word meaning, big letters, right?
97600	105040	Everybody suffers from this, right? You think, you think, oh, oh, did I spell it right? Yeah, meaning,
106000	115920	right? It's not a crisis of skill issue, right, and a crisis of meaning is actually incredibly
115920	122960	stupid when you think about it, like, you know, I think about it, I was in New York for the weekend,
122960	123920	I'm thinking about this.
132800	136800	My markers, you don't like my marker, okay, we got lots of markers to choose from, thank you, thank
136800	141600	you, you know what, guys, I'm not gonna wear black anymore, you know, I always dress in black,
141600	145600	I think I'm gonna bleach my hair blonde and I'm gonna wear brightly colored clothes,
145600	151040	not brightly colored, but like white, you know, because it's time, the tides are turning,
151840	158400	it is, it is 2024 and the tides are turning, we thought that marker was bad, this marker is
158400	165360	even worse, someday they will invent good markers, I like big shirts, you know,
170080	173600	no, it's the other way around, bro, the Fs are white, the zeros are black, come on,
174240	181440	um, wear earth colors, no, it's not about the meaning of life, right, but you guys know that
181440	185760	I'm not kidding, when I say what is the meaning of life, right, and there really is only one
185760	195520	answer that makes any sense, and that's to win, right, that's it, win, no one can see anything,
195520	204000	this board doesn't work, it's too shiny, okay, so, um,
207760	216960	how do you win, right, so I just like, like, like here we are, look around, right, you are in an
216960	226640	open world, MMORPG, right, here you are with all these people, now, how do you win at World of
226640	235120	Warcraft, how do you win at Zelda, right, how do you win it, wow, how do you win at Zelda,
235680	242080	right, why do you think it's different, why, and this is what, what just comes to me about
242080	249600	the crisis of meaning being so incredibly stupid, it's like, have you had a crisis of meaning in
249600	254160	Zelda ever, right, what am I even solving these shrines for, you know, okay, I guess it's nice,
254160	258320	I guess it's nice that you can, you can click that button and it says at the top, you know,
258320	264480	destroy Calamity Ganon, right, I'm going to stop saying right, I realize I say right at the end
264480	270160	of things and it's bad, and I'm not going to do that anymore, because it's a new year, it's 2024,
270160	276480	even though you can't see it and it's in green marker, when it felt real,
280000	287040	I understand that, but what do you think feels real anymore, I go to New York every year and the
287040	294240	things that used to feel real don't feel real anymore either, we can't go back, we can only go forward,
294720	301120	only forward, not back,
304560	310160	so you have no problem with this objective in World of Warcraft and Zelda, and there's
310160	314240	lots of different things you can do in these games, you can, you can join a guild, you can go
314240	323520	gather mushrooms in the forests, but you don't have a crisis of meaning in these games and why not,
324560	330640	why do you have a crisis of meaning in this world, but not there, I'm sorry the game is hard,
330640	340880	I'm sorry the game takes a really long time to beat, I can't tell you how to quit procrastination,
341760	350880	just the world, okay, can everybody, Harvard, can everybody read this because we're going to put
350960	358000	a big no sign for it, these people have led us wrong for the last 50 years, for the last 50 years
358000	363840	we've been listening to idiots, we don't have to listen to them anymore, Harvard's over, we're free,
366880	367200	um,
371040	378800	no we don't, we don't, there has been a group of people since, since, we'll put the year up here,
378800	385680	since 1971, that has been, you know, the year the money became fake, this is when everything
385680	389600	seemed to go awry, and we just don't have to listen to them anymore,
394880	399040	can I draw my best integral sign, go, you're the reason we're going to go subscribe only,
399840	405360	uh, no, no, no, no, don't trust me, but this is the problem now, okay, so we destroy Harvard,
405360	410000	right, everyone, everyone, everyone loves being, it was at Robespierre, everyone loves being the guy
410000	414720	who's going to, you know, storm the Bastille and kill the Nobles, but the question is what do we
414720	420800	replace it with, you, you can't replace this with a bunch of Hackney conspiracy theories and
420800	429360	libertarianism and, and, and whatever, you can't do that, you need to come up with a new,
429840	436960	uh, epistemology, sort of, I mean, not really, like, it's, it's been there the whole time,
437840	443360	it's been there the whole time, it brings me back to this point, which is how do we win?
445600	453440	So, you've played, you've played Breath of the Wild, right, some of you have, you know what
453440	458720	you're on, that little island with the four, you get the four shrines and, and, uh,
463600	467520	you get the four shrines and then you get your paraglider and you can leave the little island,
467520	473360	look at the universe, we haven't even left the little island yet, here, here, here is, here is
473360	482240	Earth, Earth, right, and here's a sun over here, right, and like space is like, like we'll make
482240	486400	it a little bigger because it's the sun, right, and like space is like that big, guys,
489520	494160	um, or to be fair, there's not going to be beautiful little quests in every corner of space,
494160	501840	this game is harder than that, reality is a hard game, it's not, not to scale, not to scale, not
502800	513920	to scale, okay, so we're going to talk about a few, uh, its name is Sol, okay fine, fine, fine,
513920	518080	Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol, that's, that's, that's, that's like the, that's like the name, we'll put Alpha
518080	526880	Centauri over here, does that, does that, Alpha, a little Alpha Centauri goes over here, I don't
526960	531440	know how to spell that, but you know, it's like, like, like, isn't that Connie's new girl, Centauri,
531440	540800	Centauri, something like that, um, not to scale, uh,
545680	552160	it's, it's not, it's not, it's not appreciate, so let's talk about a few ways that technology's
552160	557120	actually going to start to improve your life again, um, so for the 2010s,
558160	564800	I just listened to Jim Rott's Corey Doctorow, for the 2010s, tech was synonymous with this group
564800	571440	called fame, okay, most of these companies are not technology companies, and if they do technology,
571440	576160	it is mostly kind of as an aside, right, like there's some interesting stuff happening at Meta,
576160	580480	interesting stuff happening at Apple, interesting stuff happening at Google, Amazon's a logistics
580480	589040	company, Netflix is a stated media company, um, but this is not technology, and you shouldn't
589040	594480	associate that, uh, when you think technology, the best thing to think about is farming,
595520	601600	right, you guys watch, you know what's cool, Clarkson's farm, Clarkson's farm,
603920	608080	farming is the best thing to think about, because humans have been growing food for
608640	617600	many, many, many years, and oh man, if those, if those, if those first agricultural guys who were
617600	625840	trying to get like a mule to pull a plow saw a tractor, oh they flip a shit man, y'all a big tractor
625840	630720	coming through the field, you know, tilling all the soil, planting all the seeds, right, chopping
631680	644640	man, they flip a shit, so can anybody sit right here now and say that things have not gotten better?
647360	652480	And yeah, there's some, there's some great like, like crisis of meaning stuff, all things used to
652480	658400	have meaning, used to have to rely on a neighbor, things used to be better, dude, if you want things
658400	664080	to be better like that, leave America, you can, you can go, you know, I love watching these, this
664080	669200	is, this is YouTube or best documentaries, and you watch Africa documentaries, I love Africa
669200	673680	documentaries, you can see right now, if you want to go live in a world where people still need
673680	680320	each other and food's hard to get, and there's a sense of community and tribalism, you can go to
680320	687200	Africa and live this life, right, if you want to, I said right, I gotta stop doing that, um, but
687280	691840	like, do you want to be, you can opt out, you can opt out at any point, the Luddites can opt out,
692880	700800	but for most people, come on, let's be real here, do you want to be pulling the plow or do you want
700800	707280	the tractor? Um, I don't want to rely on any, yeah, it's true, it's true, like something's lost,
707280	711440	right, I'm no, I'm not a technology guy, I'm not a philosophy guy, you know, and it's a shame that
711440	716960	philosophy guys all came from, you know, terrible institutions like this, there are smart ways to
716960	721440	think about philosophy, you just don't see much of them, there are, there is a real liberal arts
721440	727920	education out there, but unfortunately, we are a lost generation, unfortunately, for the last
727920	734800	50 years, what has been called liberal arts is nothing of the sort, what you will get in a liberal
734800	743440	arts, you know, hey ho, hey ho, western culture's gotta go, come on, right, and it's not, it hasn't
743440	748320	gone anywhere, it's still there, you can still find it, there's people out there, and I love when
748320	753280	I meet them, people out there who are still incredibly educated on the humanities, but
754080	759280	these, these, these, these neo-Marxists, like, you know, I've met some smart Marxists, I've met
759280	765680	some smart Marxists, and you can, you can talk about Marx in, in, in smart ways, and it is true
765680	772400	that they still do produce some decent Marxists, but I don't think Marxism's really the future,
772400	777040	I think that it had some good points a while ago, we tried it, and hey, you know, we got the soviet
777040	798800	union, all right, Marx was a Jew, so what, what, I'm streaming, what's up, what's up,
799200	804640	I got COVID, you got COVID? Yeah. Oh, all right,
807280	820080	uh, I'm streaming, do you want to bring me? Yeah, I'd love to, uh, all right, yeah, uh, yeah,
821040	826000	should, should, should we go? No, I don't, I don't think it's fake COVID, oh yeah, the
826000	833760	flu is just whatever, the flu is just whatever, uh, happens to be the, uh, the, the, the thing,
835040	838240	that goes around, we call it the flu, we call it a cold, we call it whatever,
838240	844800	coronavirus is a cold, uh, okay, I don't have COVID, um,
847440	852160	let's not get distracted by that, we got distracted, let's, let's, let's go back to where we were,
852720	861120	so yeah, there is a real liberal arts education out there, and I hope some of you, you know,
861120	864800	only people who comment, you realize the internet commenters, always remember that the internet
864800	869040	commenters are a very small subset of society, oh, I was commenting about your Marx as a Jew,
869040	875200	so what man, come on, let's move past racism, it's 2024, and we can all agree that racism,
875200	880080	especially, uh, systemic racism, like affirmative action, systematic, systemic,
880080	884880	with the system does it, like affirmative action is evil, and there's no place for racism going
884880	889280	forward, so let's, let's, let's stop doing that, right, um, and if you're not on board with the
889280	894000	no racism, you can maybe go to Harvard, I think they like racism there, so, you know, maybe you'll
894000	901920	fit in, maybe you'll fit in, um, Jews hate white, come on, stop with the racist shit, like it's
901920	907600	still racist, it doesn't matter at all, white power, black power, wokeism, it's all racist,
907680	913360	racism's stupid, okay, you want to win or not, you know, even, even, even, Link had to work with the,
913360	916640	with those fish people, yeah, you had to work with the fish people, all right, all right,
916640	920640	you're imagining it was racist against, but stop being racist, all right, can everyone, can everyone
920640	928480	stop being racist in 2024, that's a good, come in, oh, I know, I know, I know, we're telling everybody
928480	939200	that there's no room for racism in 2024, you mean $135, well help yourself, help yourself to my pile
939200	950480	of money, um, I have some in my wall too, I think, we're on stream right now, do you need
950480	954560	just money right now, but it's like, it's like, Tony's brand, stop and buy, you want to shake his
954560	963680	mouth, all right, I got some 20s here, but it's not that, no, I just, every time I get dollars,
963680	968960	I put them in the pile over there, you want to, you want to show them my dollars, oh, here's some
968960	976960	dollars, what is happening, you want some dollars, I got dollars, um, how upset will you be if I make
976960	982960	it rain right now, wait, I wouldn't be upset, I'll pick it up, you'll pick it up, yeah, I'll make it rain!
984960	987360	I mean, I have to feel bad for the guy, I have to count it all,
990880	996880	he's been, I think, I came on a stripper, I always remember that we're having more fun than the other
996880	1006560	side, right, these cells having no fun, accelerationists have fun, uh, no, it's true though, it's true,
1006560	1011200	I've learned this, I've learned this from, from protests, right, like, you look protests,
1011200	1016160	you know, like the leftist protest used to have the energy and who's ever got the energy, but can
1016160	1022000	we have a protest where we, we stop, like, I don't know, you know what, you know what infuriated me
1022000	1026240	last night, I watched that video about housing in Japan and it turns out we really are just all
1026240	1031920	getting scammed, like there's no reason housing should be expensive, this is a deliberate policy
1031920	1036720	made up by people who own real estate to make their real estate bags that are expensive, it's
1036720	1044240	just a scam, uh, and like, you all are affected by this scam, my rent for this apartment is $4,000,
1044720	1049840	that's insane, get this in Tokyo for a, a grand,
1052160	1053840	no, um,
1056960	1061920	I'm sorry if you're a homeowner, but your bags are gonna tank bro, get out, get out while you can,
1061920	1069440	no legit, if you are in this scam, get out today, I'm warning you right now, Michael Burry's tweeting
1069440	1074880	it, yo man, uh, you guys know who Michael Burry is, right, um,
1081200	1085040	now I'm not saying you gotta do protests, I'm saying you gotta be where the energy is,
1085040	1090640	who's ever having a good time wins the future and who's ever having a bad time loses the future,
1091600	1092160	uh,
1095600	1099680	wait, no, but the housing market's actually gonna crash, it's just a question of when
1100480	1104880	perception is reality until it's not and the market can remain irrational longer than you
1104880	1110560	can remain solvent but not me, so, you know, I want to print an mRNA at home too, that's right,
1110560	1112480	um,
1116640	1121360	you've heard this shit for decades now, yes, but let me tell you what is different this time,
1122000	1127600	okay, there is one thing that changes, does anyone know what that one thing is?
1127600	1143440	Not Bitcoin technology, okay, what does it take to build a house? What if we just had a machine
1144080	1154400	that could print houses? It's, like, there's a great, I think it's a, it's a Hayek quote at the
1154400	1161040	end of the, uh, you know, the WTF happened in 1971 page, um, that says the only way that we're ever
1161040	1165600	gonna make money real again is if we figure out how to make it something that they can't quite see
1165600	1172160	is money, I'm sorry, they see Bitcoin as money, crypto failed, okay, now that doesn't mean that
1172160	1177600	technology is going to fail but this, this, this, this, like, oh, we're gonna get crypto in before
1177600	1183200	they notice, I'm sorry, no, like imagine Uber took the path that Bitcoin took, right, Uber worked,
1183200	1187840	Uber exists today because it turned out that all the congressmen were taking ubers to go to
1187840	1192160	Congress, the congressmen are not using Bitcoin to buy coffees and they don't give a shit about
1192160	1198240	crypto and until crypto people understand this, until crypto people understand how to make normal
1198240	1204320	people depend on their thing, there's no future in crypto, okay, I say this all the time, like,
1204320	1209680	you want to succeed in crypto, stop trying to make ZK snark bullshit and make triangle, it's like
1209680	1214720	square but you can pay decentralized with crypto, right, and you know, you can, there's a lot of,
1214720	1217760	I think there's actually a lot of energy like this in New York, I love New York, you pay for
1217760	1222160	everything, the cash, it works, right, and they all have, they all have signs that say 4% fee for
1222160	1226800	credit cards, I love that, I mean you have to pass it on to the consumer, the consumer has to feel
1226800	1240560	the pain of those merchant fees, check out DIMO, no, yeah, yeah, this is unfortunate,
1240560	1244080	but this is what your bags and housing are going to look like if you don't get out,
1246320	1251120	this is what your money is going to look like if you are a socialist, oh no, this is India,
1251120	1253280	democracy, yeah, that's what happens if you do democracy,
1256320	1260400	so when someone was angry at my last video saying I embrace fascists, oh Peter Thiel,
1260400	1266880	who's the fascist man, I took it crazy to me, that's like, man, you want to like give people
1266880	1271760	freedom and make things cheap, that's fascist man, you can't just do that, right, like we need like
1271760	1276000	one world government in surveillance state so we can save democracy, all right,
1281680	1286800	um, we don't need another war, can we do this without war, come on, World War III is actually
1286800	1290160	going to suck guys, like you think it's going to be cool and you think it's going to be some
1290160	1298320	call duty ship, but like it's not, okay, it's just going to suck, everyone's at ist now,
1299280	1304320	how many houses just like family owned, yo, 100% inheritance tax, who's on board,
1304320	1310480	you got to build yourself up, a war is kind of essential, I'm not an anti-war, I'm not pro-war,
1311200	1314960	I think that war is appropriate in certain circumstances,
1321120	1325680	World War III, I mean, I love cold wars, cold wars are the best, cold wars are the best possible
1325680	1331680	outcome of wars, nobody dies when technology gets better, I love the US, China cold war,
1331680	1336160	maybe we can have AI skirmishes where drones destroy each other over the pacific ocean,
1336160	1338560	now that's my kind of war, right, we can get behind that,
1341600	1347040	no, warm wars sucked in the kind that, the worst kind of war, like World War II was awful, okay,
1347040	1351680	and the worst kind of war is a war that wants to get the citizenry involved, right, like a total
1351680	1356640	war where your citizenry have to contribute to the stupid war effort sucks, okay, none of us want
1356640	1363920	to live through that, a nice war between US and China where we like fight over some uninhabited
1363920	1370480	island to just like a tech pissing contest, that sounds sick man, like that's the kind of war we
1370480	1377120	want in the future, okay, it's not like nice war, right, it's an understanding that both sides could
1377120	1381200	nuke each other and turn everybody into rubble, right, we sort of do this with proxy wars,
1381200	1385440	it's a little upsetting that people still have to die, imagine we had proxy wars where we just
1385440	1392480	sent robots, and we can all agree to some Geneva 2.0 convention where we all just send robots to war
1392480	1402160	and anyone who sends people to war is a terrorist, how about that, tech bro wants war, no I do,
1402160	1409040	I do want that kind of war though, I think every year we should have drone combat with China over
1409840	1415440	to take control of an uninhabited island, rules, you can't send people, and maybe there's a,
1415440	1419360	no no there's not to be a budget cap, it's like the olympic games but with technology,
1419360	1425040	I think that'd be sick, that's a huge waste of resources bro, bro what are we gonna do,
1425040	1429920	help poor people in Somalia, come on, come on, drone war sounds sick, George you can't do that,
1429920	1436880	that's fascist, okay, well that's like your opinion man, that's my new phrase for like
1437840	1443040	that's like your opinion man, I think it's from the Big Lebowski, I think it's good, war on the moon,
1443040	1450240	let's go, right, the thing about the moon is almost everything you do to it improves the place,
1450240	1458720	you explode a nuclear bomb on the moon, I bet it gets better, have I seen for all mankind,
1458800	1462560	nah what's that, is that like seven genes, true religion,
1467120	1472480	space rays, except you can shoot at other spaces, no no no no, let's have the pvp zones of space
1472480	1477520	and the pve zones of space, I'm not saying that about crypto right, like we like that, that'd be cool,
1478480	1488240	uh no no no, I did like her to think about it, but you know I think we're gonna we're gonna
1488240	1493200	compliment Mark Andreessen, I think I think Mark Andreessen does bring up a really good point
1493200	1501920	about these sort of radical uh radical uh Luddites and if they really believe that this
1501920	1506640	technology is going to destroy the world, if you are going to destroy the world and you think
1506640	1510080	you know if you really think that your neighbor is working on a project that's going to destroy the
1510080	1513760	world, killing your neighbor is the right thing to do right and they're going to become violent,
1514960	1518560	you know hopefully not, hopefully they see the light before they do, but I think this is one
1518560	1523280	of the smartest things Andreessen said and it is uh sadly something we have to watch out for,
1523280	1536160	but the good news is we have drones and they do not, um I am a Christian, uh look guys
1537440	1548000	yeah, all right, um I can't believe I was duped into atheism, but also evolution is real,
1549120	1556000	so yeah like Christianity, I can see, I do sort of see a bit of a resurgence of Christianity among
1556800	1563200	younger people, I'm a Christian, I believe in evolution, uh my belief in evolution does come
1563280	1568400	above my Christianity right, so so if you say you can't, you know, if you say Jesus didn't
1568400	1574240	die for your sins if you believe in evolution, well that's like your opinion man, uh so but no
1574240	1580160	when it comes down to a lot of the, again wokeism really showed me the importance of Christianity
1580160	1584880	and the importance of forgiveness, wokeism is original sin without forgiveness uh and we can't
1584880	1590560	have that, we have original sin but we have forgiveness okay, that's Christianity, I like it
1590560	1594240	everyone should get on board, it's a nice religion, we love everybody, come to a church,
1595040	1598320	I don't know church is kind of boring, someone's got to make cool churches, actually the churches
1598320	1603120	in the south are cool, if I lived in the south by like one of them like, I went to like Seacoast
1603120	1608560	church in South Carolina, and it was good and I'd probably go every sunday, uh you know the the
1610400	1614960	the low-budget Catholic church doesn't, doesn't, doesn't draw me in every weekend, not not hate and
1614960	1619520	it just doesn't draw me in every weekend, uh the rock bands are cool right, like I think this is
1619520	1624480	good, I think that like all right fine, they finally caught up to the 1970s but I would love to see a
1624480	1630240	resurgence of the church, uh that a church that embraces technology, because if you do not embrace
1630240	1638880	technology you will lose, how do you, how do these people who say they don't like tech, like do they
1638880	1644480	have a sustainable plan for the future, do they have like like have they thought about what the
1644480	1649280	future is going to look like, people who don't like tech are like conservatives, uh conservatives
1649280	1653520	we're gonna rip on conservatives, everybody knows conservatives suck, uh the kind of conservatives
1653520	1658560	who like in the 90s really didn't like gay marriage, and today they really don't like trans people,
1658560	1663600	right, but gay marriage is fine, and then in 20 years, well trans people are fine but we have to
1663600	1668640	do something about pedophiles, right, like, like, like, like it's gonna be, these conservatives
1668640	1675520	are always losing because they have no principles, it's just a backlash, a backlash to the backlash
1675520	1684320	to the thing that's just begun, right, so don't, uh, don't be a conservative, don't be a Luddite,
1684320	1689760	unless you like losing, who's the worst, who's the worst football team in the NFL, I was saying this,
1690400	1697600	I was saying this to a friend yesterday, uh, you know, there's some people who just, I gotta stop
1697600	1701440	saying you know, and I gotta stop saying, right, I'm self-aware about this stuff, right, you know,
1702080	1709280	uh, the Jets aren't pedos always better, I don't like pedos, but like, again, oh, I don't want to
1709280	1721680	get into this, come on, let's, let's, let's, uh, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's not get into
1721680	1726160	this, but I think there is a destination of where this stuff goes, and it can just, culture
1726160	1731840	or stupid, the culture or stupid, there's only one war that matters, and that's, are you on the side
1731840	1739200	of technology, or are you against technology, this is the new dividing line, this is the new
1739200	1745760	dividing line in society, we don't have, uh, conservatives and liberals anymore, we have
1745760	1757600	excel and desal, okay, desal and excel, and which side are you on, are you on this side,
1757600	1766320	or are you on this side, now this side is conservative, so we'll give them a C,
1767840	1773680	all right, and this side is progressive, we'll give them a P, and if you've been listening to the
1773680	1779760	last five minutes, you realize that the C's always lose and the P's always win, so do you want to root
1779760	1784640	for the Oakland Raiders, or do you want to root for the Patriots when they still had Tom Brady,
1784640	1794160	look it's a P, right, so it is kind of still conservatives and liberals, but this is really
1794160	1801680	the dividing line, now look, embracing technology does not mean embracing every single piece of
1801680	1806000	every single technology, and it's all good even if there's negative effects, that's not what it means,
1807120	1813680	that's not what it means, I think the most pure way to distill this down, and every metric can
1813680	1820080	still be perverted, every metric can be perverted, good heart's law, but I think the most pure way
1820080	1829440	to look at it is energy use, this is energy use up, and this is energy use minus, do we want to use
1829440	1835440	more energy in the future, or do we want to use less energy in the future, humans, population,
1836480	1841520	do we want there to be more humans in the future, more than less humans in the future,
1841520	1846080	some people might put a plus there and still be conservatives, but really it's all the same thing,
1846640	1851360	energy use in humans, what's the difference, humans use a lot of energy, well you can't use the
1851440	1858400	energy for that, no, right, are you a progressive or are you a conservative,
1860000	1863440	are there people out there who are conservatives, and I don't mean to hate on the individual who's
1863440	1868400	a conservative, the conservative who wants to be left alone and live their own lifestyle, we need
1868400	1873040	to totally respect that, I totally respect the person who doesn't want to allow the new technology
1873040	1878240	into their lives, and that's fine, you can, and you should, you should be left alone, and that's
1878240	1883440	the moral duty of these people, the moral duty of these people is to people who want to be left
1883440	1887440	alone, people who don't want the technology to come for them, it absolutely should not come for
1887440	1892800	them, people should totally be able to opt out of this, otherwise you're just asking for a fight,
1894080	1899600	and I think that's a real, I think that's a mistake that the current progressives make,
1899600	1906480	so if you want to opt out you can opt out, what you cannot do is prevent this, if you're on this
1906480	1911360	side and you want to exist, that's fine, but if you're on this side and you want to try to stop
1911360	1916240	this, that's where we have a problem, and these are the people who need to be soundly defeated in
1916240	1924880	every poll, in every ballot, in every democracy, in every war, in every everything, war is the
1924880	1930720	fundamental decider, we don't, doesn't have to come to war, let's hope it doesn't have to come to
1930720	1935520	war, let's hope these people realize that if you don't embrace technology you lose, and you don't
1935520	1941600	even have to fight, now let's give them good surrender terms, let them surrender peacefully,
1942320	1946960	let them live out life on their farm, let them reproduce, this is animal conservation,
1946960	1954400	it's the same thing, we like animal conservation, we're progressives, all right, so everybody,
1955840	1962160	in 2024 welcome to the progressive team, welcome to the accelerationist team, we love technology,
1962160	1968720	we want to see more humans, we want to see flourishing, we don't want to see deceleration,
1968720	1973600	we don't want to see housing not being built, we don't want to see power plants being knocked down,
1973600	1978320	we don't want to see one child policies, we don't see anything that looks like this,
1978320	1982560	it's negative, it's negative, got got positive energy over here, see I'm not dressing in black
1982560	1988000	anymore, it's time, it's time the future is ours, wow, is this, is this, is this just me with the
1988480	1995680	same accelerationist and recent manifesto, come on, so coming back to here, coming back to meaning,
1998560	2004880	look, what is the existentialism of the 21st century, I don't know, I'm not that great at
2004880	2011120	liberal arts, I'm not, I'm a good programmer, I'm a good security guy, I'm not, I like the stuff,
2011120	2017120	I'm a hobbyist, but when I meet people who are genuinely good at this stuff, the people who know
2017440	2021840	all of the Sart books and the Camus books, the people who've actually read like,
2022400	2027680	like being in time and who are like, I understand it, what was on my book, Kant's, what's Kant's,
2029680	2035360	oh, critique of pure reason, like the people who've actually read critique of pure reason,
2035360	2041520	I just, I can't do it, but there's people out there who have, and this is a, this is a serious
2041520	2046640	role in the future for this, figure out what the existentialism of the 21st century is,
2047680	2053680	I don't know, I don't know, but there's answers here, and the closest I can come is thinking about
2053680	2059920	winning, I don't mean winning over other people, I mean winning over nature, we are in this great
2060720	2071200	open world universe and, well, do we want to win or lose, let's win, you could stand in the same
2071200	2075120	place, you could, you could play Zelda, you could just stand there, but why would we do that,
2075120	2078560	you could play your little, you could play your little minigame, go around, catch horses, buy
2078560	2082720	that one stable all day, but why would we do that, let's progress, let's get to the end of the game,
2087360	2090960	we're gonna be tired of winning, we're gonna win so much, we're gonna be tired of winning,
2092480	2099920	Jesus, Trump 5 in 2024, what a, what a sad, what a sad state, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't
2100640	2103360	matter, this is the new line, this is the new line,
2106640	2109440	you're either on this team or you're on this team,
2112560	2118640	all right, and no racism, okay, I don't see any racism, 2024, if you want to be racist,
2118640	2123840	go to Harvard, okay, they gotta, they gotta, let them, let them have racism, and you know,
2123840	2128960	they can, they can be stuck in 1971 and, and you know, let them have racism,
2131920	2142400	Charlie Schumann's out of his time, Harvard is racist, yes, yes, they are, they are,
2143280	2148480	they have, they, they, so, so look, let's just come up with a very simple definition of racism,
2149040	2154960	if you are looking at people's race, if you are making decisions based on people's race,
2154960	2161920	you are a racist, pretty straightforward, right, so if Harvard looks at people's race,
2161920	2168880	when they decide who to admit, they are racist, and because Harvard is a powerful corporation,
2168880	2174480	that's systemic racism, okay, should I, should I teach, should I teach impression studies,
2174480	2182000	does everyone like this, systemic racism, when a government or a large corporation
2182000	2193680	uses race to discriminate, systemic racism, is a doctor racist then, a doctor doesn't use that
2193680	2198720	to discriminate, right, if a doctor were to look at someone's race and charge them a different
2198720	2204800	amount based on their race, sure, if, if you, you, race affects your medical, yeah, but come on,
2204800	2210080	we live in a society, we live in a Christian society where we're all equal under God, okay,
2210720	2219040	everybody has the same moral value to God, now, that doesn't mean that everyone's going to have
2219040	2223840	the same stuff, that's just, that's just the economy, that's just, we live in a free world,
2223840	2228240	you make, you make choices, you, you have free will, you also unfortunately are somewhat trapped
2228240	2233120	to your genetics, but that's just life, sometimes the ball comes up red, sometimes the ball comes up
2233120	2238880	black, should we make roulette illegal, no, but we should remove the zeros from the wheels,
2238880	2244160	one zero is plenty, three zeros is really egregious, and someone needs to do something about this,
2244160	2256320	is all racism bad, I think so, okay, now, I do think race does correlate with certain
2256320	2261520	things that you may want to discriminate based on, you may want to discriminate based on culture,
2261520	2266400	you may want to live around people who have similar values to you, this is all very different,
2266400	2274640	and this is not racism, racism is literally, racism is asking the question, what race are you,
2274640	2283040	this is not a real category, this is bullshit, it singles out a few pieces of DNA that don't,
2283680	2291040	this is your color, your skin, come on man, this is, we are progressives here, we have moved past
2291440	2294880	this, okay, racism is over, it's back at Harvard,
2298960	2304000	how do we build the protect future, I mean, it's not going to be easy and it's not going to happen
2304000	2308960	overnight, there's going to be a big struggle, okay, so let's get, let's move fast, racism is a
2308960	2315280	stupid topic, let's move to a good topic, okay, housing, right, this is Peter Teal's thesis and
2315280	2321120	I've come to believe that it's very true, if we can fix housing we can fix a lot of other problems
2321120	2326080	in society, so housing you basically have two groups, you have land owners
2328960	2337360	and then the renters, I mean I'm in this class, so we have two classes, now let's say rents were to
2337360	2346800	come down 75%, the renters would be happy but the landowner class, the homeowner class would be
2346800	2360240	unhappy, their bads would become smaller, look, you got to give them a way out, you got to give
2360240	2364000	them a way out, I don't know what that's going to be, I hope people smarter than me or at least
2364000	2368800	thinking about this more than me are working on this because you do have to give them a bag out
2368800	2376000	that this is what needs to happen, you're going to get continued very strong opposition from this
2376000	2387600	class, this is why this won't happen but if we figure out how to either satiate, swindle, whatever
2387600	2393360	it is we do to this class, I don't know, I'm all for diplomatic solutions here but something's
2393360	2398480	got to be done, this is class warfare, this is Marxism 101, they really try to distract you with
2398480	2405440	race is bullshit but we are the 99% boys, we are the 99% and something's got to be done about the
2405440	2409360	damn landowners gouging everybody because they don't just gouge everybody by charging a lot for
2409360	2413600	their properties, they vote in elections and then they make it illegal to the more housing,
2414480	2419200	basically, I hope everyone understands this now and hope everyone sees that it doesn't have to be
2419200	2426000	this way, I think the simplest way to get people out of this and into this is to show them that the
2426000	2432480	future can be better than the present, if you live in a world where we're in pretty much decline
2432480	2439280	since 1971, it's hard for them to believe that the future can be better than the present, look up,
2439280	2443040	look up, trust in the US government, look up trust in the US government, peek to Kennedy and it's
2443040	2447920	gone downhill since, little spiked Reagan, little spiked Clinton but mostly it's gone downhill since
2450160	2455280	we need to convince people things can be better and they can, thanks to technology
2456240	2461760	because everyone can agree that attractor is a lot better than plowing the field yourself
2463760	2469120	so eat the rich, I love it, I love it, let's team up with AOC, we got to get AOC on this team,
2469120	2474400	right, we got to, how do we get AOC on this team, we can do it because these are the good guys
2480160	2483440	I know Uncle Ted wouldn't agree but like
2489760	2497200	it's not good, it's not good, we got to move past that, we got to move past that ridiculous way
2497200	2501520	of thinking that somehow meaning is being stripped from the world, all right let's talk about, let's
2501600	2509520	talk about, let's talk about Ted Kicinski, right, guy love nature, wild nature, guy did not like
2509520	2514480	uniform housing projects, I don't like uniform housing projects either, the things that we
2514480	2518720	can build in the future look more like nature, there's a pirate wires article about this,
2520160	2527760	we can, the reason that houses are boring beige boxes is because the manufacturing technologies
2527760	2534080	of the last 100 years allow us to build boring beige boxes, as we get control of, as we can use
2534080	2541120	ad-lib manufacturing technologies, as we can use biotech to build, that's the look at species 8472,
2541120	2547920	that's the future, like a fusion of biology and the things in the future are going to look more
2547920	2555280	like nature, not less like nature, we will exist in more harmony with nature, with more technology,
2556240	2563120	things today are, when you think about, I just want you to imagine an appliance from the 1950s
2563120	2569680	and how sketchy it looked, the thing was a fire hazard, the thing was, think about like a transformer
2569680	2574640	and you're putting things through and your coils are vibrating at 60 hertz and it's scraping the
2574640	2581920	enamel off the coils, now compare that to a MOSFET, think about it, think about a beautiful little
2581920	2588880	tiny MOSFET, switching a kilowatt, you switch a kilowatt with a MOSFET, you know 50 volts 20 amps
2588880	2596320	is a kilowatt, with a MOSFET, I don't know, it's the MOSFET symbol, now we'll draw the transistor,
2598320	2604960	compare this, this is also not to scale, compare this to, oh what I gotta build a relay,
2604960	2610320	what am I gonna do, build a relay, I'm gonna pull a magnet on here and then have like a little like
2610320	2622720	electromagnetic coil here, oh, oh, the solid state, the technology gets us closer to like
2623520	2630880	beautiful pure things, the relay and the transformer last a way shorter amount of time,
2630880	2634880	I know that's not a MOSFET, what's the MOSFET, what's the MOSFET symbol, well you know what,
2634880	2639520	I'm gonna label them gate drain and source, so therefore it is a MOSFET, there we go,
2639520	2649920	take that electrical engineering, actually this is this, right, the drain is the emitter,
2649920	2665440	the source is the collector, I don't know, is that right, I mean I think yeah because usually
2665440	2671840	your drain is like, if you have like a, it depends, I think it depends if it's n-type or p-type,
2677360	2684880	yeah, we could go into, but it's this stuff, I was watching a, you watched a Superbowl
2684880	2697040	from 1995, you watched like the Superbowl show and you look at these large halogen lamps that
2697040	2702480	you can't switch on and off quickly, how would you even do that, how would you even switch it on
2702480	2712240	and off quickly, today we have LEDs switched by MOSFETs, come on, that's cool, so drain,
2712240	2715680	source and drain, it's gate, source and drain, we have three things, but I forget that one,
2715680	2720000	that's this n-t-n because I do the arrow that way, p-n-p's the other way, I don't know, I come from
2721040	2731840	pre-MOSFET, small transistor uses less energy, out arrow is n-type, yeah, okay,
2731840	2744960	MOSFET and heat sink, yeah, but you need a tinier heat sink today,
2745600	2753360	you need a tinier heat sink today than you do in the past because your, so MOSFET has a resistance
2753360	2759200	here, you have, you have some, you have some basic like, like the model is that it's a semiconductor
2759360	2764960	with some resistance, actually just resistance that matters, so you have some drain source
2764960	2771200	resistance when your MOSFET's fully saturated and these things are becoming, this like, it's,
2771200	2778880	I think it's beyond 99% efficient today, meaning that for every, for every, you want to switch
2778880	2783760	a kilowatt, you only need to sink 10 watts, I bet there are even more, I bet there are even more
2783760	2789760	than 99% efficient today, if we had computers we could look this stuff up, but the future is so
2789760	2801040	bright, I agree, so this is a separate problem and we need real liberal arts majors to work on this,
2801040	2807200	we need people who actually understand what, what was called the liberal arts for many, many years
2807200	2814400	till it was perverted by a Marxist cult, right, is this controversial, I think, I think everyone
2814400	2825360	kind of gets it now, um, what can us as engineers do, okay, stop and I say the same thing I always say,
2826480	2830160	think about what you're working on and what the convergent endpoint of it is,
2830640	2837280	think about where your technology is going and how your technology is going to change the world,
2837840	2843040	what group of people is it going to benefit, is it going to benefit, if you are at a physics
2843040	2848640	research lab researching MOSFET's with lower drain source resistance, you are doing good for the world,
2849440	2860080	if you are working on a, you know, I don't have a name to have to give examples,
2860080	2863520	you know the kind of things that I'm talking about, if you are working on,
2864800	2869760	if you work at TurboTax and you are lobbying the IRS to make the tax code more complicated,
2869760	2875680	that's my favorite example, but there's many forms of that, if you are working to slow down any of
2875680	2880560	this technology, if you are the person who made Elon strap a seal to a board, you're the bad guy,
2882720	2887840	so what can you as engineers do, I mean think about who you work for, do you work for people who
2887840	2892960	look like this or do you work for people who look like this, a lot of these sort of people still
2892960	2899360	want technology, the New York Times has somebody making their website, don't do that, the New York
2899360	2908240	Times actually isn't that bad, but you know the ones who are bad, if they're not, if the ownership
2908240	2915040	of your company is fundamentally against technology, stop working for them and start working for people
2915040	2919360	who like technology and want the future to be better than the present,
2920160	2927840	Yeah, Fang and John Deere are probably on the left side of the board,
2931200	2933920	I mean I think, I don't look, I don't know that much about John Deere,
2936400	2943680	for Fang companies, yeah I mean I wouldn't work at Google, I think Google is fairly anti-technology
2943680	2948640	today, I think that it's less clear for companies like Amazon,
2952480	2958160	well of course they were lion-tech and look, just like, just like welcome to the, you know,
2958160	2965760	welcome to the, welcome to the, welcome to the 2020s, the lit 2020s, where we used to, people
2965760	2970960	used to quit because they're, they're, you know, oh my company doesn't support, like my company
2970960	2975840	isn't pro-choice, I'm going to quit the company, right, that's right, I respect these people right
2975840	2981520	to stand up for what they believe in and all the engineers out there, you know, stand up for what
2981520	2991040	you believe in, right, it's the same thing, but I think, you know, it's, it's, if your, if your
2991040	2998000	company doesn't share a pro-technology set of values, stop working there, stop helping them with
2998000	3008640	technology. Meta is, these companies are large, they have many different divisions, they have many
3008640	3021760	different teams, I think that I can promise that all of my interactions with Elon match up to what
3021760	3028320	you think Elon is. Elon seems to be complete, like there is no, there actually isn't a filter,
3028320	3034240	how Elon behaves is what Elon is. I can't say the same thing about Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos,
3034240	3041120	I'm not sure, I'm not saying that they're not, but what I'm saying is it's not completely obvious
3041120	3049120	to me and see if you can find somebody who would vouch for them, you know, someone who's, someone who's,
3049200	3053520	someone who spent time close with Mark Zuckerberg, does he actually believe the kind of stuff he's
3053520	3059520	saying now? And then there's also a question of do these people have, you look at someone like
3059520	3064640	Jack Dorsey on Twitter, it turns out Jack Dorsey was just cut out of everything on Twitter. So
3064640	3069440	sometimes you might even have, the question is do they have control and do they have good values?
3071600	3076480	So come on, we all learned, we all learned from the SJWs in the 2010s, some of their tactics are
3076480	3080880	good, some of their tactics are good, don't announce them because they're SJW tactics,
3080880	3087920	but always make sure that you are having fun and if you're not having fun, you're going to lose,
3087920	3091440	right? If you, if you see this all as drudgery and this is what I said on Twitter, I'm like,
3091440	3096640	if you don't love technology, quit technology, right, it's going to be a party and that's the
3096640	3100800	kind of energy that was, I loved Occupy Wall Street back in the day, that's the kind of energy
3100800	3105440	that, that, that, that works, that's sustainable. Everyone here is having a good time building
3105440	3118000	the future. What's the name of this cult? It's not a cult and it's the future, the progressivism,
3118000	3121760	it's progressivism, right? Progressivism, we believe in progress.
3121760	3131920	We're boogieing, right? Electric Boogaloo, I love that, the Boogaloo boys.
3133920	3140640	See, they're having a good time, man. How is Excel the good side if the doomers are right?
3141440	3146000	What are the doomers right about? Everybody can say AI and they can say doom, okay?
3146960	3152560	What exactly, how exactly does AI lead to doom? I was trying to get Yudkowski to explain it and
3152560	3157360	it's just like convergent endpoint. You know what else a convergent endpoint is? The heat death of
3157360	3163040	the universe, okay? The heat death of the universe is coming and if we have any chance of answering
3163040	3168640	the last question, we need AI. So currently, we are on a trajectory to doom. I want everybody to
3168640	3173360	remember that. You know, some people have those clocks that like, how long you have in your lifespan?
3173360	3176000	Well, how long do we have before the heat death of the universe?
3178400	3183680	Right? Right? I gotta stop saying that. I gotta stop saying that. I gotta stop my verbal tics.
3183680	3191840	It's 2024. So it gets more than a few billion years, but the heat death of the universe is coming
3192640	3196640	and in order to beat the heat death of the universe, we need AI. Maybe,
3196640	3198880	maybe you can't beat the heat death of the universe. We don't really know.
3203760	3209520	AI leads to doom when the government uses autonomous robocops.
3212080	3216480	With all technology, there's challenges. With every technology in the past, with all this
3216480	3223600	new surveillance technology that now exists, there are challenges. Is AI a pure unalloyed good?
3223600	3228000	No. Is technology a pure unalloyed good? When you have a gun pointed at your head,
3228000	3234960	you do not think technology is a pure unalloyed good, but on balance is technology good.
3235600	3244320	And the answer is, I think obviously, with things like age back and cheap food and cars,
3244320	3248720	and look like, I flew here, I just flew here on JetBlue from New York, right? I could talk
3248720	3256000	shit about JetBlue, but imagine flying in that like right flyer too. At least that was on A321.
3258720	3263520	I'm against progress of technology. They no longer provide benefits. That's not true.
3264960	3271280	We are unfortunately, like you've been scammed by a group of people for the last 50 years.
3271280	3275600	The reason things have gotten worse is largely not because of technology. I also just listened to
3275600	3286480	Corey Doctorow on Jim Rutt's podcast. And like, we have been scammed largely through
3286480	3290960	government inaction against these tech companies. I saw someone in the comments like, George,
3290960	3296880	you don't even know you can download other browsers for iOS. I just, someone says something
3296880	3301120	like that. I want you to think. I want you to think, do I not know how browsers work on iOS
3301120	3306800	or are you wrong? When you download Chrome on iOS, it uses a web view, which is actually just Safari,
3306800	3313520	because nothing else on iOS is allowed to mark pages RWX. RWX is a permission built into the
3313520	3319680	kernel that only the Jits allowed to bypass. There is a 5% chance I'm out of date on that
3319680	3325600	information, but I don't think so. Okay, so you'd think who you talking to, right? We went from
3325600	3332240	a world where Microsoft couldn't bundle Internet Explorer with Windows without getting sued. And
3332240	3336880	now we live in a world where Apple not only bundles Safari, but doesn't let you install anything else.
3338160	3343360	So this is not due to technology. This is due to failure of government. This is due to regulatory
3343360	3350800	capture. Technology itself. When you think of technology, don't think of Fang. Think of a
3350800	3357680	MOSFET. A very simplistic model of a MOSFET. You put in a little current here and massive
3357680	3365520	currents flow here. It's a switch. And that has changed. That's why everything's so small and
3365520	3372000	good now. You have a phone that can charge. I got my phone charger around here. 67 watts.
3372000	3376000	You're putting 67 watts into something this big. You think you can do that without MOSFET?
3376000	3383200	You can use a transformer? So everybody, don't think of Fang when you think of technology. Think
3383200	3390160	of the MOSFET. All right. That's where iOS is now for the Mac. Yeah, for the Mac actually,
3390160	3397440	you can install it from web browsers. Thank you for watching today's stream. It's the end of 2023.
3400240	3406080	Make sure you're having a good time. If you're not having a good time, if you're angry, you're
3406080	3410720	probably over here. And might I consider switching to the, you know what the P stands for? It stands
3410720	3416560	for party. You're joining, you're joining the party side. Happy 2024. Everybody have a great
3416560	3423840	New Year's on Alloy. Tech optimism. Someone's got to solve this. Someone's got to solve this.
3423840	3430560	Let's create an alternative to this that can produce real liberal arts scholars who can
3430560	3434400	solve the meeting crisis. I'm not smart enough to come up with it, but I'm smart enough to read it
3434400	3444080	and understand it. So I would appreciate that if you were out there. Happy New Year, everybody.
