1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome, welcome, welcome to my stream, hello everybody, our chair over here, we can sit

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,880
down, we're not really that visible though, we can maybe tilt it down a little, we're

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,760
gonna write on the whiteboard, let's wait for some people to get in here, oh good morning,

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
we don't subscribe, we're only chat, we don't need to subscribe, we're only chat, thank you for

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:39,280
subscribing. Is this setup working? We have the whiteboard today, no computer, only whiteboard.

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,320
I did a lot of thinking about the last stream, I did a lot of thinking about the

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:59,440
techno-peasantism argument for the last one, it was brought up in a few things and we can discuss

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:12,400
crisis of meaning, right, maybe you've heard this phrase, who thinks it's true,

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,600
right, can everyone see the board? No one can see the board, I need to write way bigger.

10
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,800
I need to write way bigger, this is not big enough for the board.

11
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,040
Wow, now I understand what you guys always say with the font, right?

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,120
We're just gonna write the word meaning, big letters, right?

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,040
Everybody suffers from this, right? You think, you think, oh, oh, did I spell it right? Yeah, meaning,

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,920
right? It's not a crisis of skill issue, right, and a crisis of meaning is actually incredibly

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,960
stupid when you think about it, like, you know, I think about it, I was in New York for the weekend,

16
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
I'm thinking about this.

17
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
My markers, you don't like my marker, okay, we got lots of markers to choose from, thank you, thank

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,600
you, you know what, guys, I'm not gonna wear black anymore, you know, I always dress in black,

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I think I'm gonna bleach my hair blonde and I'm gonna wear brightly colored clothes,

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,040
not brightly colored, but like white, you know, because it's time, the tides are turning,

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,400
it is, it is 2024 and the tides are turning, we thought that marker was bad, this marker is

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,360
even worse, someday they will invent good markers, I like big shirts, you know,

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,600
no, it's the other way around, bro, the Fs are white, the zeros are black, come on,

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,440
um, wear earth colors, no, it's not about the meaning of life, right, but you guys know that

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm not kidding, when I say what is the meaning of life, right, and there really is only one

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:15,520
answer that makes any sense, and that's to win, right, that's it, win, no one can see anything,

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:24,000
this board doesn't work, it's too shiny, okay, so, um,

28
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:36,960
how do you win, right, so I just like, like, like here we are, look around, right, you are in an

29
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:46,640
open world, MMORPG, right, here you are with all these people, now, how do you win at World of

30
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:55,120
Warcraft, how do you win at Zelda, right, how do you win it, wow, how do you win at Zelda,

31
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,080
right, why do you think it's different, why, and this is what, what just comes to me about

32
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,600
the crisis of meaning being so incredibly stupid, it's like, have you had a crisis of meaning in

33
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,160
Zelda ever, right, what am I even solving these shrines for, you know, okay, I guess it's nice,

34
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,320
I guess it's nice that you can, you can click that button and it says at the top, you know,

35
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,480
destroy Calamity Ganon, right, I'm going to stop saying right, I realize I say right at the end

36
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,160
of things and it's bad, and I'm not going to do that anymore, because it's a new year, it's 2024,

37
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,480
even though you can't see it and it's in green marker, when it felt real,

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,040
I understand that, but what do you think feels real anymore, I go to New York every year and the

39
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,240
things that used to feel real don't feel real anymore either, we can't go back, we can only go forward,

40
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,120
only forward, not back,

41
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,160
so you have no problem with this objective in World of Warcraft and Zelda, and there's

42
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,240
lots of different things you can do in these games, you can, you can join a guild, you can go

43
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,520
gather mushrooms in the forests, but you don't have a crisis of meaning in these games and why not,

44
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,640
why do you have a crisis of meaning in this world, but not there, I'm sorry the game is hard,

45
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm sorry the game takes a really long time to beat, I can't tell you how to quit procrastination,

46
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:50,880
just the world, okay, can everybody, Harvard, can everybody read this because we're going to put

47
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,000
a big no sign for it, these people have led us wrong for the last 50 years, for the last 50 years

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,840
we've been listening to idiots, we don't have to listen to them anymore, Harvard's over, we're free,

49
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,200
um,

50
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,800
no we don't, we don't, there has been a group of people since, since, we'll put the year up here,

51
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,680
since 1971, that has been, you know, the year the money became fake, this is when everything

52
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
seemed to go awry, and we just don't have to listen to them anymore,

53
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,040
can I draw my best integral sign, go, you're the reason we're going to go subscribe only,

54
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,360
uh, no, no, no, no, don't trust me, but this is the problem now, okay, so we destroy Harvard,

55
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
right, everyone, everyone, everyone loves being, it was at Robespierre, everyone loves being the guy

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
who's going to, you know, storm the Bastille and kill the Nobles, but the question is what do we

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,800
replace it with, you, you can't replace this with a bunch of Hackney conspiracy theories and

58
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:09,360
libertarianism and, and, and whatever, you can't do that, you need to come up with a new,

59
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,960
uh, epistemology, sort of, I mean, not really, like, it's, it's been there the whole time,

60
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,360
it's been there the whole time, it brings me back to this point, which is how do we win?

61
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,440
So, you've played, you've played Breath of the Wild, right, some of you have, you know what

62
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,720
you're on, that little island with the four, you get the four shrines and, and, uh,

63
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,520
you get the four shrines and then you get your paraglider and you can leave the little island,

64
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,360
look at the universe, we haven't even left the little island yet, here, here, here is, here is

65
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:02,240
Earth, Earth, right, and here's a sun over here, right, and like space is like, like we'll make

66
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
it a little bigger because it's the sun, right, and like space is like that big, guys,

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
um, or to be fair, there's not going to be beautiful little quests in every corner of space,

68
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,840
this game is harder than that, reality is a hard game, it's not, not to scale, not to scale, not

69
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:33,920
to scale, okay, so we're going to talk about a few, uh, its name is Sol, okay fine, fine, fine,

70
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,080
Sol, Sol, Sol, Sol, that's, that's, that's, that's like the, that's like the name, we'll put Alpha

71
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,880
Centauri over here, does that, does that, Alpha, a little Alpha Centauri goes over here, I don't

72
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,440
know how to spell that, but you know, it's like, like, like, isn't that Connie's new girl, Centauri,

73
00:08:51,440 --> 00:09:00,800
Centauri, something like that, um, not to scale, uh,

74
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,160
it's, it's not, it's not, it's not appreciate, so let's talk about a few ways that technology's

75
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,120
actually going to start to improve your life again, um, so for the 2010s,

76
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,800
I just listened to Jim Rott's Corey Doctorow, for the 2010s, tech was synonymous with this group

77
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,440
called fame, okay, most of these companies are not technology companies, and if they do technology,

78
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
it is mostly kind of as an aside, right, like there's some interesting stuff happening at Meta,

79
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
interesting stuff happening at Apple, interesting stuff happening at Google, Amazon's a logistics

80
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:49,040
company, Netflix is a stated media company, um, but this is not technology, and you shouldn't

81
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,480
associate that, uh, when you think technology, the best thing to think about is farming,

82
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,600
right, you guys watch, you know what's cool, Clarkson's farm, Clarkson's farm,

83
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,080
farming is the best thing to think about, because humans have been growing food for

84
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:17,600
many, many, many years, and oh man, if those, if those, if those first agricultural guys who were

85
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:25,840
trying to get like a mule to pull a plow saw a tractor, oh they flip a shit man, y'all a big tractor

86
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,720
coming through the field, you know, tilling all the soil, planting all the seeds, right, chopping

87
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:44,640
man, they flip a shit, so can anybody sit right here now and say that things have not gotten better?

88
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,480
And yeah, there's some, there's some great like, like crisis of meaning stuff, all things used to

89
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,400
have meaning, used to have to rely on a neighbor, things used to be better, dude, if you want things

90
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,080
to be better like that, leave America, you can, you can go, you know, I love watching these, this

91
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,200
is, this is YouTube or best documentaries, and you watch Africa documentaries, I love Africa

92
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,680
documentaries, you can see right now, if you want to go live in a world where people still need

93
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,320
each other and food's hard to get, and there's a sense of community and tribalism, you can go to

94
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,200
Africa and live this life, right, if you want to, I said right, I gotta stop doing that, um, but

95
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,840
like, do you want to be, you can opt out, you can opt out at any point, the Luddites can opt out,

96
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,800
but for most people, come on, let's be real here, do you want to be pulling the plow or do you want

97
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,280
the tractor? Um, I don't want to rely on any, yeah, it's true, it's true, like something's lost,

98
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,440
right, I'm no, I'm not a technology guy, I'm not a philosophy guy, you know, and it's a shame that

99
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,960
philosophy guys all came from, you know, terrible institutions like this, there are smart ways to

100
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,440
think about philosophy, you just don't see much of them, there are, there is a real liberal arts

101
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,920
education out there, but unfortunately, we are a lost generation, unfortunately, for the last

102
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,800
50 years, what has been called liberal arts is nothing of the sort, what you will get in a liberal

103
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:23,440
arts, you know, hey ho, hey ho, western culture's gotta go, come on, right, and it's not, it hasn't

104
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,320
gone anywhere, it's still there, you can still find it, there's people out there, and I love when

105
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,280
I meet them, people out there who are still incredibly educated on the humanities, but

106
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,280
these, these, these, these neo-Marxists, like, you know, I've met some smart Marxists, I've met

107
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,680
some smart Marxists, and you can, you can talk about Marx in, in, in smart ways, and it is true

108
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,400
that they still do produce some decent Marxists, but I don't think Marxism's really the future,

109
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,040
I think that it had some good points a while ago, we tried it, and hey, you know, we got the soviet

110
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:18,800
union, all right, Marx was a Jew, so what, what, I'm streaming, what's up, what's up,

111
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,640
I got COVID, you got COVID? Yeah. Oh, all right,

112
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:40,080
uh, I'm streaming, do you want to bring me? Yeah, I'd love to, uh, all right, yeah, uh, yeah,

113
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,000
should, should, should we go? No, I don't, I don't think it's fake COVID, oh yeah, the

114
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,760
flu is just whatever, the flu is just whatever, uh, happens to be the, uh, the, the, the thing,

115
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
that goes around, we call it the flu, we call it a cold, we call it whatever,

116
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,800
coronavirus is a cold, uh, okay, I don't have COVID, um,

117
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
let's not get distracted by that, we got distracted, let's, let's, let's go back to where we were,

118
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:21,120
so yeah, there is a real liberal arts education out there, and I hope some of you, you know,

119
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,800
only people who comment, you realize the internet commenters, always remember that the internet

120
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,040
commenters are a very small subset of society, oh, I was commenting about your Marx as a Jew,

121
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,200
so what man, come on, let's move past racism, it's 2024, and we can all agree that racism,

122
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,080
especially, uh, systemic racism, like affirmative action, systematic, systemic,

123
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,880
with the system does it, like affirmative action is evil, and there's no place for racism going

124
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,280
forward, so let's, let's, let's stop doing that, right, um, and if you're not on board with the

125
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,000
no racism, you can maybe go to Harvard, I think they like racism there, so, you know, maybe you'll

126
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,920
fit in, maybe you'll fit in, um, Jews hate white, come on, stop with the racist shit, like it's

127
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,600
still racist, it doesn't matter at all, white power, black power, wokeism, it's all racist,

128
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,360
racism's stupid, okay, you want to win or not, you know, even, even, even, Link had to work with the,

129
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,640
with those fish people, yeah, you had to work with the fish people, all right, all right,

130
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,640
you're imagining it was racist against, but stop being racist, all right, can everyone, can everyone

131
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,480
stop being racist in 2024, that's a good, come in, oh, I know, I know, I know, we're telling everybody

132
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:39,200
that there's no room for racism in 2024, you mean $135, well help yourself, help yourself to my pile

133
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:50,480
of money, um, I have some in my wall too, I think, we're on stream right now, do you need

134
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
just money right now, but it's like, it's like, Tony's brand, stop and buy, you want to shake his

135
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:03,680
mouth, all right, I got some 20s here, but it's not that, no, I just, every time I get dollars,

136
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,960
I put them in the pile over there, you want to, you want to show them my dollars, oh, here's some

137
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,960
dollars, what is happening, you want some dollars, I got dollars, um, how upset will you be if I make

138
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,960
it rain right now, wait, I wouldn't be upset, I'll pick it up, you'll pick it up, yeah, I'll make it rain!

139
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,360
I mean, I have to feel bad for the guy, I have to count it all,

140
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,880
he's been, I think, I came on a stripper, I always remember that we're having more fun than the other

141
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:46,560
side, right, these cells having no fun, accelerationists have fun, uh, no, it's true though, it's true,

142
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,200
I've learned this, I've learned this from, from protests, right, like, you look protests,

143
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,160
you know, like the leftist protest used to have the energy and who's ever got the energy, but can

144
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,000
we have a protest where we, we stop, like, I don't know, you know what, you know what infuriated me

145
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
last night, I watched that video about housing in Japan and it turns out we really are just all

146
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,920
getting scammed, like there's no reason housing should be expensive, this is a deliberate policy

147
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,720
made up by people who own real estate to make their real estate bags that are expensive, it's

148
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:24,240
just a scam, uh, and like, you all are affected by this scam, my rent for this apartment is $4,000,

149
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,840
that's insane, get this in Tokyo for a, a grand,

150
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,840
no, um,

151
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,920
I'm sorry if you're a homeowner, but your bags are gonna tank bro, get out, get out while you can,

152
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:49,440
no legit, if you are in this scam, get out today, I'm warning you right now, Michael Burry's tweeting

153
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,880
it, yo man, uh, you guys know who Michael Burry is, right, um,

154
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,040
now I'm not saying you gotta do protests, I'm saying you gotta be where the energy is,

155
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,640
who's ever having a good time wins the future and who's ever having a bad time loses the future,

156
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,160
uh,

157
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,680
wait, no, but the housing market's actually gonna crash, it's just a question of when

158
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,880
perception is reality until it's not and the market can remain irrational longer than you

159
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,560
can remain solvent but not me, so, you know, I want to print an mRNA at home too, that's right,

160
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,480
um,

161
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,360
you've heard this shit for decades now, yes, but let me tell you what is different this time,

162
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,600
okay, there is one thing that changes, does anyone know what that one thing is?

163
00:18:47,600 --> 00:19:03,440
Not Bitcoin technology, okay, what does it take to build a house? What if we just had a machine

164
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:14,400
that could print houses? It's, like, there's a great, I think it's a, it's a Hayek quote at the

165
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,040
end of the, uh, you know, the WTF happened in 1971 page, um, that says the only way that we're ever

166
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,600
gonna make money real again is if we figure out how to make it something that they can't quite see

167
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,160
is money, I'm sorry, they see Bitcoin as money, crypto failed, okay, now that doesn't mean that

168
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,600
technology is going to fail but this, this, this, this, like, oh, we're gonna get crypto in before

169
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,200
they notice, I'm sorry, no, like imagine Uber took the path that Bitcoin took, right, Uber worked,

170
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,840
Uber exists today because it turned out that all the congressmen were taking ubers to go to

171
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,160
Congress, the congressmen are not using Bitcoin to buy coffees and they don't give a shit about

172
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,240
crypto and until crypto people understand this, until crypto people understand how to make normal

173
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,320
people depend on their thing, there's no future in crypto, okay, I say this all the time, like,

174
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,680
you want to succeed in crypto, stop trying to make ZK snark bullshit and make triangle, it's like

175
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,720
square but you can pay decentralized with crypto, right, and you know, you can, there's a lot of,

176
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
I think there's actually a lot of energy like this in New York, I love New York, you pay for

177
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,160
everything, the cash, it works, right, and they all have, they all have signs that say 4% fee for

178
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,800
credit cards, I love that, I mean you have to pass it on to the consumer, the consumer has to feel

179
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:40,560
the pain of those merchant fees, check out DIMO, no, yeah, yeah, this is unfortunate,

180
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,080
but this is what your bags and housing are going to look like if you don't get out,

181
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,120
this is what your money is going to look like if you are a socialist, oh no, this is India,

182
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
democracy, yeah, that's what happens if you do democracy,

183
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,400
so when someone was angry at my last video saying I embrace fascists, oh Peter Thiel,

184
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,880
who's the fascist man, I took it crazy to me, that's like, man, you want to like give people

185
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,760
freedom and make things cheap, that's fascist man, you can't just do that, right, like we need like

186
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,000
one world government in surveillance state so we can save democracy, all right,

187
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,800
um, we don't need another war, can we do this without war, come on, World War III is actually

188
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,160
going to suck guys, like you think it's going to be cool and you think it's going to be some

189
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:38,320
call duty ship, but like it's not, okay, it's just going to suck, everyone's at ist now,

190
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,320
how many houses just like family owned, yo, 100% inheritance tax, who's on board,

191
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,480
you got to build yourself up, a war is kind of essential, I'm not an anti-war, I'm not pro-war,

192
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
I think that war is appropriate in certain circumstances,

193
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,680
World War III, I mean, I love cold wars, cold wars are the best, cold wars are the best possible

194
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,680
outcome of wars, nobody dies when technology gets better, I love the US, China cold war,

195
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,160
maybe we can have AI skirmishes where drones destroy each other over the pacific ocean,

196
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,560
now that's my kind of war, right, we can get behind that,

197
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,040
no, warm wars sucked in the kind that, the worst kind of war, like World War II was awful, okay,

198
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,680
and the worst kind of war is a war that wants to get the citizenry involved, right, like a total

199
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,640
war where your citizenry have to contribute to the stupid war effort sucks, okay, none of us want

200
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,920
to live through that, a nice war between US and China where we like fight over some uninhabited

201
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,480
island to just like a tech pissing contest, that sounds sick man, like that's the kind of war we

202
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,120
want in the future, okay, it's not like nice war, right, it's an understanding that both sides could

203
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,200
nuke each other and turn everybody into rubble, right, we sort of do this with proxy wars,

204
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,440
it's a little upsetting that people still have to die, imagine we had proxy wars where we just

205
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,480
sent robots, and we can all agree to some Geneva 2.0 convention where we all just send robots to war

206
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:22,160
and anyone who sends people to war is a terrorist, how about that, tech bro wants war, no I do,

207
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:29,040
I do want that kind of war though, I think every year we should have drone combat with China over

208
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,440
to take control of an uninhabited island, rules, you can't send people, and maybe there's a,

209
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,360
no no there's not to be a budget cap, it's like the olympic games but with technology,

210
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,040
I think that'd be sick, that's a huge waste of resources bro, bro what are we gonna do,

211
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,920
help poor people in Somalia, come on, come on, drone war sounds sick, George you can't do that,

212
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,880
that's fascist, okay, well that's like your opinion man, that's my new phrase for like

213
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,040
that's like your opinion man, I think it's from the Big Lebowski, I think it's good, war on the moon,

214
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:10,240
let's go, right, the thing about the moon is almost everything you do to it improves the place,

215
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,720
you explode a nuclear bomb on the moon, I bet it gets better, have I seen for all mankind,

216
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,560
nah what's that, is that like seven genes, true religion,

217
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,480
space rays, except you can shoot at other spaces, no no no no, let's have the pvp zones of space

218
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,520
and the pve zones of space, I'm not saying that about crypto right, like we like that, that'd be cool,

219
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:48,240
uh no no no, I did like her to think about it, but you know I think we're gonna we're gonna

220
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,200
compliment Mark Andreessen, I think I think Mark Andreessen does bring up a really good point

221
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:01,920
about these sort of radical uh radical uh Luddites and if they really believe that this

222
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,640
technology is going to destroy the world, if you are going to destroy the world and you think

223
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
you know if you really think that your neighbor is working on a project that's going to destroy the

224
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,760
world, killing your neighbor is the right thing to do right and they're going to become violent,

225
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,560
you know hopefully not, hopefully they see the light before they do, but I think this is one

226
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,280
of the smartest things Andreessen said and it is uh sadly something we have to watch out for,

227
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:36,160
but the good news is we have drones and they do not, um I am a Christian, uh look guys

228
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:48,000
yeah, all right, um I can't believe I was duped into atheism, but also evolution is real,

229
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:56,000
so yeah like Christianity, I can see, I do sort of see a bit of a resurgence of Christianity among

230
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,200
younger people, I'm a Christian, I believe in evolution, uh my belief in evolution does come

231
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,400
above my Christianity right, so so if you say you can't, you know, if you say Jesus didn't

232
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,240
die for your sins if you believe in evolution, well that's like your opinion man, uh so but no

233
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,160
when it comes down to a lot of the, again wokeism really showed me the importance of Christianity

234
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,880
and the importance of forgiveness, wokeism is original sin without forgiveness uh and we can't

235
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,560
have that, we have original sin but we have forgiveness okay, that's Christianity, I like it

236
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,240
everyone should get on board, it's a nice religion, we love everybody, come to a church,

237
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,320
I don't know church is kind of boring, someone's got to make cool churches, actually the churches

238
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,120
in the south are cool, if I lived in the south by like one of them like, I went to like Seacoast

239
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,560
church in South Carolina, and it was good and I'd probably go every sunday, uh you know the the

240
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,960
the low-budget Catholic church doesn't, doesn't, doesn't draw me in every weekend, not not hate and

241
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,520
it just doesn't draw me in every weekend, uh the rock bands are cool right, like I think this is

242
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,480
good, I think that like all right fine, they finally caught up to the 1970s but I would love to see a

243
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,240
resurgence of the church, uh that a church that embraces technology, because if you do not embrace

244
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:18,880
technology you will lose, how do you, how do these people who say they don't like tech, like do they

245
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,480
have a sustainable plan for the future, do they have like like have they thought about what the

246
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,280
future is going to look like, people who don't like tech are like conservatives, uh conservatives

247
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,520
we're gonna rip on conservatives, everybody knows conservatives suck, uh the kind of conservatives

248
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,560
who like in the 90s really didn't like gay marriage, and today they really don't like trans people,

249
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,600
right, but gay marriage is fine, and then in 20 years, well trans people are fine but we have to

250
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,640
do something about pedophiles, right, like, like, like, like it's gonna be, these conservatives

251
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,520
are always losing because they have no principles, it's just a backlash, a backlash to the backlash

252
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:04,320
to the thing that's just begun, right, so don't, uh, don't be a conservative, don't be a Luddite,

253
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,760
unless you like losing, who's the worst, who's the worst football team in the NFL, I was saying this,

254
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,600
I was saying this to a friend yesterday, uh, you know, there's some people who just, I gotta stop

255
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,440
saying you know, and I gotta stop saying, right, I'm self-aware about this stuff, right, you know,

256
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,280
uh, the Jets aren't pedos always better, I don't like pedos, but like, again, oh, I don't want to

257
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:41,680
get into this, come on, let's, let's, let's, uh, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's not get into

258
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,160
this, but I think there is a destination of where this stuff goes, and it can just, culture

259
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,840
or stupid, the culture or stupid, there's only one war that matters, and that's, are you on the side

260
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,200
of technology, or are you against technology, this is the new dividing line, this is the new

261
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,760
dividing line in society, we don't have, uh, conservatives and liberals anymore, we have

262
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:17,600
excel and desal, okay, desal and excel, and which side are you on, are you on this side,

263
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:26,320
or are you on this side, now this side is conservative, so we'll give them a C,

264
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,680
all right, and this side is progressive, we'll give them a P, and if you've been listening to the

265
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:39,760
last five minutes, you realize that the C's always lose and the P's always win, so do you want to root

266
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,640
for the Oakland Raiders, or do you want to root for the Patriots when they still had Tom Brady,

267
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:54,160
look it's a P, right, so it is kind of still conservatives and liberals, but this is really

268
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:01,680
the dividing line, now look, embracing technology does not mean embracing every single piece of

269
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,000
every single technology, and it's all good even if there's negative effects, that's not what it means,

270
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,680
that's not what it means, I think the most pure way to distill this down, and every metric can

271
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,080
still be perverted, every metric can be perverted, good heart's law, but I think the most pure way

272
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:29,440
to look at it is energy use, this is energy use up, and this is energy use minus, do we want to use

273
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,440
more energy in the future, or do we want to use less energy in the future, humans, population,

274
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,520
do we want there to be more humans in the future, more than less humans in the future,

275
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,080
some people might put a plus there and still be conservatives, but really it's all the same thing,

276
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,360
energy use in humans, what's the difference, humans use a lot of energy, well you can't use the

277
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,400
energy for that, no, right, are you a progressive or are you a conservative,

278
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,440
are there people out there who are conservatives, and I don't mean to hate on the individual who's

279
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,400
a conservative, the conservative who wants to be left alone and live their own lifestyle, we need

280
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,040
to totally respect that, I totally respect the person who doesn't want to allow the new technology

281
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,240
into their lives, and that's fine, you can, and you should, you should be left alone, and that's

282
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,440
the moral duty of these people, the moral duty of these people is to people who want to be left

283
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,440
alone, people who don't want the technology to come for them, it absolutely should not come for

284
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,800
them, people should totally be able to opt out of this, otherwise you're just asking for a fight,

285
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,600
and I think that's a real, I think that's a mistake that the current progressives make,

286
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,480
so if you want to opt out you can opt out, what you cannot do is prevent this, if you're on this

287
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,360
side and you want to exist, that's fine, but if you're on this side and you want to try to stop

288
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,240
this, that's where we have a problem, and these are the people who need to be soundly defeated in

289
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:04,880
every poll, in every ballot, in every democracy, in every war, in every everything, war is the

290
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,720
fundamental decider, we don't, doesn't have to come to war, let's hope it doesn't have to come to

291
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,520
war, let's hope these people realize that if you don't embrace technology you lose, and you don't

292
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,600
even have to fight, now let's give them good surrender terms, let them surrender peacefully,

293
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,960
let them live out life on their farm, let them reproduce, this is animal conservation,

294
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,400
it's the same thing, we like animal conservation, we're progressives, all right, so everybody,

295
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,160
in 2024 welcome to the progressive team, welcome to the accelerationist team, we love technology,

296
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,720
we want to see more humans, we want to see flourishing, we don't want to see deceleration,

297
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,600
we don't want to see housing not being built, we don't want to see power plants being knocked down,

298
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,320
we don't want to see one child policies, we don't see anything that looks like this,

299
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,560
it's negative, it's negative, got got positive energy over here, see I'm not dressing in black

300
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,000
anymore, it's time, it's time the future is ours, wow, is this, is this, is this just me with the

301
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,680
same accelerationist and recent manifesto, come on, so coming back to here, coming back to meaning,

302
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,880
look, what is the existentialism of the 21st century, I don't know, I'm not that great at

303
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,120
liberal arts, I'm not, I'm a good programmer, I'm a good security guy, I'm not, I like the stuff,

304
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,120
I'm a hobbyist, but when I meet people who are genuinely good at this stuff, the people who know

305
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,840
all of the Sart books and the Camus books, the people who've actually read like,

306
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,680
like being in time and who are like, I understand it, what was on my book, Kant's, what's Kant's,

307
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,360
oh, critique of pure reason, like the people who've actually read critique of pure reason,

308
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,520
I just, I can't do it, but there's people out there who have, and this is a, this is a serious

309
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,640
role in the future for this, figure out what the existentialism of the 21st century is,

310
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:13,680
I don't know, I don't know, but there's answers here, and the closest I can come is thinking about

311
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:19,920
winning, I don't mean winning over other people, I mean winning over nature, we are in this great

312
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:31,200
open world universe and, well, do we want to win or lose, let's win, you could stand in the same

313
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,120
place, you could, you could play Zelda, you could just stand there, but why would we do that,

314
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,560
you could play your little, you could play your little minigame, go around, catch horses, buy

315
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,720
that one stable all day, but why would we do that, let's progress, let's get to the end of the game,

316
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,960
we're gonna be tired of winning, we're gonna win so much, we're gonna be tired of winning,

317
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:59,920
Jesus, Trump 5 in 2024, what a, what a sad, what a sad state, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't

318
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,360
matter, this is the new line, this is the new line,

319
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
you're either on this team or you're on this team,

320
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,640
all right, and no racism, okay, I don't see any racism, 2024, if you want to be racist,

321
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,840
go to Harvard, okay, they gotta, they gotta, let them, let them have racism, and you know,

322
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,960
they can, they can be stuck in 1971 and, and you know, let them have racism,

323
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:42,400
Charlie Schumann's out of his time, Harvard is racist, yes, yes, they are, they are,

324
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,480
they have, they, they, so, so look, let's just come up with a very simple definition of racism,

325
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,960
if you are looking at people's race, if you are making decisions based on people's race,

326
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,920
you are a racist, pretty straightforward, right, so if Harvard looks at people's race,

327
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,880
when they decide who to admit, they are racist, and because Harvard is a powerful corporation,

328
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,480
that's systemic racism, okay, should I, should I teach, should I teach impression studies,

329
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:22,000
does everyone like this, systemic racism, when a government or a large corporation

330
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:33,680
uses race to discriminate, systemic racism, is a doctor racist then, a doctor doesn't use that

331
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,720
to discriminate, right, if a doctor were to look at someone's race and charge them a different

332
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,800
amount based on their race, sure, if, if you, you, race affects your medical, yeah, but come on,

333
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,080
we live in a society, we live in a Christian society where we're all equal under God, okay,

334
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:59,040
everybody has the same moral value to God, now, that doesn't mean that everyone's going to have

335
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,840
the same stuff, that's just, that's just the economy, that's just, we live in a free world,

336
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,240
you make, you make choices, you, you have free will, you also unfortunately are somewhat trapped

337
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,120
to your genetics, but that's just life, sometimes the ball comes up red, sometimes the ball comes up

338
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,880
black, should we make roulette illegal, no, but we should remove the zeros from the wheels,

339
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
one zero is plenty, three zeros is really egregious, and someone needs to do something about this,

340
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:36,320
is all racism bad, I think so, okay, now, I do think race does correlate with certain

341
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,520
things that you may want to discriminate based on, you may want to discriminate based on culture,

342
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,400
you may want to live around people who have similar values to you, this is all very different,

343
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:54,640
and this is not racism, racism is literally, racism is asking the question, what race are you,

344
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:03,040
this is not a real category, this is bullshit, it singles out a few pieces of DNA that don't,

345
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:11,040
this is your color, your skin, come on man, this is, we are progressives here, we have moved past

346
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,880
this, okay, racism is over, it's back at Harvard,

347
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,000
how do we build the protect future, I mean, it's not going to be easy and it's not going to happen

348
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,960
overnight, there's going to be a big struggle, okay, so let's get, let's move fast, racism is a

349
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,280
stupid topic, let's move to a good topic, okay, housing, right, this is Peter Teal's thesis and

350
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,120
I've come to believe that it's very true, if we can fix housing we can fix a lot of other problems

351
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,080
in society, so housing you basically have two groups, you have land owners

352
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:57,360
and then the renters, I mean I'm in this class, so we have two classes, now let's say rents were to

353
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:06,800
come down 75%, the renters would be happy but the landowner class, the homeowner class would be

354
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:20,240
unhappy, their bads would become smaller, look, you got to give them a way out, you got to give

355
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,000
them a way out, I don't know what that's going to be, I hope people smarter than me or at least

356
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,800
thinking about this more than me are working on this because you do have to give them a bag out

357
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:36,000
that this is what needs to happen, you're going to get continued very strong opposition from this

358
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:47,600
class, this is why this won't happen but if we figure out how to either satiate, swindle, whatever

359
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,360
it is we do to this class, I don't know, I'm all for diplomatic solutions here but something's

360
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,480
got to be done, this is class warfare, this is Marxism 101, they really try to distract you with

361
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,440
race is bullshit but we are the 99% boys, we are the 99% and something's got to be done about the

362
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,360
damn landowners gouging everybody because they don't just gouge everybody by charging a lot for

363
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,600
their properties, they vote in elections and then they make it illegal to the more housing,

364
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,200
basically, I hope everyone understands this now and hope everyone sees that it doesn't have to be

365
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,000
this way, I think the simplest way to get people out of this and into this is to show them that the

366
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,480
future can be better than the present, if you live in a world where we're in pretty much decline

367
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,280
since 1971, it's hard for them to believe that the future can be better than the present, look up,

368
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,040
look up, trust in the US government, look up trust in the US government, peek to Kennedy and it's

369
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,920
gone downhill since, little spiked Reagan, little spiked Clinton but mostly it's gone downhill since

370
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,280
we need to convince people things can be better and they can, thanks to technology

371
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,760
because everyone can agree that attractor is a lot better than plowing the field yourself

372
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,120
so eat the rich, I love it, I love it, let's team up with AOC, we got to get AOC on this team,

373
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,400
right, we got to, how do we get AOC on this team, we can do it because these are the good guys

374
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,440
I know Uncle Ted wouldn't agree but like

375
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:37,200
it's not good, it's not good, we got to move past that, we got to move past that ridiculous way

376
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,520
of thinking that somehow meaning is being stripped from the world, all right let's talk about, let's

377
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:49,520
talk about, let's talk about Ted Kicinski, right, guy love nature, wild nature, guy did not like

378
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,480
uniform housing projects, I don't like uniform housing projects either, the things that we

379
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,720
can build in the future look more like nature, there's a pirate wires article about this,

380
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,760
we can, the reason that houses are boring beige boxes is because the manufacturing technologies

381
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,080
of the last 100 years allow us to build boring beige boxes, as we get control of, as we can use

382
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:21,120
ad-lib manufacturing technologies, as we can use biotech to build, that's the look at species 8472,

383
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:27,920
that's the future, like a fusion of biology and the things in the future are going to look more

384
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:35,280
like nature, not less like nature, we will exist in more harmony with nature, with more technology,

385
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:43,120
things today are, when you think about, I just want you to imagine an appliance from the 1950s

386
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:49,680
and how sketchy it looked, the thing was a fire hazard, the thing was, think about like a transformer

387
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,640
and you're putting things through and your coils are vibrating at 60 hertz and it's scraping the

388
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,920
enamel off the coils, now compare that to a MOSFET, think about it, think about a beautiful little

389
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,880
tiny MOSFET, switching a kilowatt, you switch a kilowatt with a MOSFET, you know 50 volts 20 amps

390
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:16,320
is a kilowatt, with a MOSFET, I don't know, it's the MOSFET symbol, now we'll draw the transistor,

391
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,960
compare this, this is also not to scale, compare this to, oh what I gotta build a relay,

392
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,320
what am I gonna do, build a relay, I'm gonna pull a magnet on here and then have like a little like

393
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:42,720
electromagnetic coil here, oh, oh, the solid state, the technology gets us closer to like

394
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:50,880
beautiful pure things, the relay and the transformer last a way shorter amount of time,

395
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,880
I know that's not a MOSFET, what's the MOSFET, what's the MOSFET symbol, well you know what,

396
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,520
I'm gonna label them gate drain and source, so therefore it is a MOSFET, there we go,

397
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:09,920
take that electrical engineering, actually this is this, right, the drain is the emitter,

398
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:25,440
the source is the collector, I don't know, is that right, I mean I think yeah because usually

399
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,840
your drain is like, if you have like a, it depends, I think it depends if it's n-type or p-type,

400
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:44,880
yeah, we could go into, but it's this stuff, I was watching a, you watched a Superbowl

401
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:57,040
from 1995, you watched like the Superbowl show and you look at these large halogen lamps that

402
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,480
you can't switch on and off quickly, how would you even do that, how would you even switch it on

403
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:12,240
and off quickly, today we have LEDs switched by MOSFETs, come on, that's cool, so drain,

404
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,680
source and drain, it's gate, source and drain, we have three things, but I forget that one,

405
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,000
that's this n-t-n because I do the arrow that way, p-n-p's the other way, I don't know, I come from

406
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:31,840
pre-MOSFET, small transistor uses less energy, out arrow is n-type, yeah, okay,

407
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:44,960
MOSFET and heat sink, yeah, but you need a tinier heat sink today,

408
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:53,360
you need a tinier heat sink today than you do in the past because your, so MOSFET has a resistance

409
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,200
here, you have, you have some, you have some basic like, like the model is that it's a semiconductor

410
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:04,960
with some resistance, actually just resistance that matters, so you have some drain source

411
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,200
resistance when your MOSFET's fully saturated and these things are becoming, this like, it's,

412
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:18,880
I think it's beyond 99% efficient today, meaning that for every, for every, you want to switch

413
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,760
a kilowatt, you only need to sink 10 watts, I bet there are even more, I bet there are even more

414
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,760
than 99% efficient today, if we had computers we could look this stuff up, but the future is so

415
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:41,040
bright, I agree, so this is a separate problem and we need real liberal arts majors to work on this,

416
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,200
we need people who actually understand what, what was called the liberal arts for many, many years

417
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:54,400
till it was perverted by a Marxist cult, right, is this controversial, I think, I think everyone

418
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:05,360
kind of gets it now, um, what can us as engineers do, okay, stop and I say the same thing I always say,

419
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,160
think about what you're working on and what the convergent endpoint of it is,

420
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:17,280
think about where your technology is going and how your technology is going to change the world,

421
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:23,040
what group of people is it going to benefit, is it going to benefit, if you are at a physics

422
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,640
research lab researching MOSFET's with lower drain source resistance, you are doing good for the world,

423
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:40,080
if you are working on a, you know, I don't have a name to have to give examples,

424
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,520
you know the kind of things that I'm talking about, if you are working on,

425
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,760
if you work at TurboTax and you are lobbying the IRS to make the tax code more complicated,

426
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,680
that's my favorite example, but there's many forms of that, if you are working to slow down any of

427
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,560
this technology, if you are the person who made Elon strap a seal to a board, you're the bad guy,

428
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,840
so what can you as engineers do, I mean think about who you work for, do you work for people who

429
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,960
look like this or do you work for people who look like this, a lot of these sort of people still

430
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:19,360
want technology, the New York Times has somebody making their website, don't do that, the New York

431
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:28,240
Times actually isn't that bad, but you know the ones who are bad, if they're not, if the ownership

432
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,040
of your company is fundamentally against technology, stop working for them and start working for people

433
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,360
who like technology and want the future to be better than the present,

434
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:47,840
Yeah, Fang and John Deere are probably on the left side of the board,

435
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,920
I mean I think, I don't look, I don't know that much about John Deere,

436
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,680
for Fang companies, yeah I mean I wouldn't work at Google, I think Google is fairly anti-technology

437
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,640
today, I think that it's less clear for companies like Amazon,

438
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,160
well of course they were lion-tech and look, just like, just like welcome to the, you know,

439
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:25,760
welcome to the, welcome to the, welcome to the 2020s, the lit 2020s, where we used to, people

440
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,960
used to quit because they're, they're, you know, oh my company doesn't support, like my company

441
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,840
isn't pro-choice, I'm going to quit the company, right, that's right, I respect these people right

442
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:41,520
to stand up for what they believe in and all the engineers out there, you know, stand up for what

443
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:51,040
you believe in, right, it's the same thing, but I think, you know, it's, it's, if your, if your

444
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:58,000
company doesn't share a pro-technology set of values, stop working there, stop helping them with

445
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:08,640
technology. Meta is, these companies are large, they have many different divisions, they have many

446
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:21,760
different teams, I think that I can promise that all of my interactions with Elon match up to what

447
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:28,320
you think Elon is. Elon seems to be complete, like there is no, there actually isn't a filter,

448
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:34,240
how Elon behaves is what Elon is. I can't say the same thing about Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos,

449
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:41,120
I'm not sure, I'm not saying that they're not, but what I'm saying is it's not completely obvious

450
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:49,120
to me and see if you can find somebody who would vouch for them, you know, someone who's, someone who's,

451
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,520
someone who spent time close with Mark Zuckerberg, does he actually believe the kind of stuff he's

452
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,520
saying now? And then there's also a question of do these people have, you look at someone like

453
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,640
Jack Dorsey on Twitter, it turns out Jack Dorsey was just cut out of everything on Twitter. So

454
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,440
sometimes you might even have, the question is do they have control and do they have good values?

455
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,480
So come on, we all learned, we all learned from the SJWs in the 2010s, some of their tactics are

456
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,880
good, some of their tactics are good, don't announce them because they're SJW tactics,

457
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,920
but always make sure that you are having fun and if you're not having fun, you're going to lose,

458
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,440
right? If you, if you see this all as drudgery and this is what I said on Twitter, I'm like,

459
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,640
if you don't love technology, quit technology, right, it's going to be a party and that's the

460
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,800
kind of energy that was, I loved Occupy Wall Street back in the day, that's the kind of energy

461
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,440
that, that, that, that works, that's sustainable. Everyone here is having a good time building

462
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:58,000
the future. What's the name of this cult? It's not a cult and it's the future, the progressivism,

463
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,760
it's progressivism, right? Progressivism, we believe in progress.

464
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:11,920
We're boogieing, right? Electric Boogaloo, I love that, the Boogaloo boys.

465
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,640
See, they're having a good time, man. How is Excel the good side if the doomers are right?

466
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,000
What are the doomers right about? Everybody can say AI and they can say doom, okay?

467
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,560
What exactly, how exactly does AI lead to doom? I was trying to get Yudkowski to explain it and

468
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,360
it's just like convergent endpoint. You know what else a convergent endpoint is? The heat death of

469
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:43,040
the universe, okay? The heat death of the universe is coming and if we have any chance of answering

470
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,640
the last question, we need AI. So currently, we are on a trajectory to doom. I want everybody to

471
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,360
remember that. You know, some people have those clocks that like, how long you have in your lifespan?

472
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,000
Well, how long do we have before the heat death of the universe?

473
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,680
Right? Right? I gotta stop saying that. I gotta stop saying that. I gotta stop my verbal tics.

474
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:11,840
It's 2024. So it gets more than a few billion years, but the heat death of the universe is coming

475
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,640
and in order to beat the heat death of the universe, we need AI. Maybe,

476
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,880
maybe you can't beat the heat death of the universe. We don't really know.

477
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,520
AI leads to doom when the government uses autonomous robocops.

478
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,480
With all technology, there's challenges. With every technology in the past, with all this

479
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:43,600
new surveillance technology that now exists, there are challenges. Is AI a pure unalloyed good?

480
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,000
No. Is technology a pure unalloyed good? When you have a gun pointed at your head,

481
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,960
you do not think technology is a pure unalloyed good, but on balance is technology good.

482
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:04,320
And the answer is, I think obviously, with things like age back and cheap food and cars,

483
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,720
and look like, I flew here, I just flew here on JetBlue from New York, right? I could talk

484
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:16,000
shit about JetBlue, but imagine flying in that like right flyer too. At least that was on A321.

485
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,520
I'm against progress of technology. They no longer provide benefits. That's not true.

486
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:31,280
We are unfortunately, like you've been scammed by a group of people for the last 50 years.

487
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,600
The reason things have gotten worse is largely not because of technology. I also just listened to

488
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:46,480
Corey Doctorow on Jim Rutt's podcast. And like, we have been scammed largely through

489
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,960
government inaction against these tech companies. I saw someone in the comments like, George,

490
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,880
you don't even know you can download other browsers for iOS. I just, someone says something

491
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,120
like that. I want you to think. I want you to think, do I not know how browsers work on iOS

492
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:06,800
or are you wrong? When you download Chrome on iOS, it uses a web view, which is actually just Safari,

493
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:13,520
because nothing else on iOS is allowed to mark pages RWX. RWX is a permission built into the

494
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:19,680
kernel that only the Jits allowed to bypass. There is a 5% chance I'm out of date on that

495
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,600
information, but I don't think so. Okay, so you'd think who you talking to, right? We went from

496
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,240
a world where Microsoft couldn't bundle Internet Explorer with Windows without getting sued. And

497
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,880
now we live in a world where Apple not only bundles Safari, but doesn't let you install anything else.

498
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,360
So this is not due to technology. This is due to failure of government. This is due to regulatory

499
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:50,800
capture. Technology itself. When you think of technology, don't think of Fang. Think of a

500
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,680
MOSFET. A very simplistic model of a MOSFET. You put in a little current here and massive

501
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:05,520
currents flow here. It's a switch. And that has changed. That's why everything's so small and

502
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:12,000
good now. You have a phone that can charge. I got my phone charger around here. 67 watts.

503
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You're putting 67 watts into something this big. You think you can do that without MOSFET?

504
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,200
You can use a transformer? So everybody, don't think of Fang when you think of technology. Think

505
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:30,160
of the MOSFET. All right. That's where iOS is now for the Mac. Yeah, for the Mac actually,

506
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:37,440
you can install it from web browsers. Thank you for watching today's stream. It's the end of 2023.

507
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,080
Make sure you're having a good time. If you're not having a good time, if you're angry, you're

508
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,720
probably over here. And might I consider switching to the, you know what the P stands for? It stands

509
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:56,560
for party. You're joining, you're joining the party side. Happy 2024. Everybody have a great

510
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:03,840
New Year's on Alloy. Tech optimism. Someone's got to solve this. Someone's got to solve this.

511
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:10,560
Let's create an alternative to this that can produce real liberal arts scholars who can

512
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,400
solve the meeting crisis. I'm not smart enough to come up with it, but I'm smart enough to read it

513
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:24,080
and understand it. So I would appreciate that if you were out there. Happy New Year, everybody.
