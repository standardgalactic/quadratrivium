1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
I just got access to the code interpreter plugin about 48 hours ago and have been running

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,000
experiments on it non-stop since then. I've come up with about 18 examples to show you guys its

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
power. Most of them I reckon haven't been seen before. I predict many industries will have to

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
update overnight when it's released more widely and at the end of the video please let me know

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,640
what you think and what other experiments that we can try. First though, what about this one?

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,360
A 3D surface plot. Just quickly, the way it works is you click this little button to the

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,200
left of the text box and then you can upload many different file types like CSV files, word files,

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,400
images and even short videos. Then it will automatically analyze the file type without

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,560
you pressing anything and then of course you give it a prompt and as with all of chatbt it becomes a

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,400
conversation. So the first 3d surface plot was decent but it was too small so I simply said in

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,880
natural language can you make it four times bigger thank you and of course you have seen the

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,440
amazing end result even with the lighting. Look at these shadows there. I believe this is based

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,120
on a real contour map of a volcano in New Zealand and I could do a whole video just on this but I

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,640
have 17 other examples to get to but this one was truly amazing. Did you know for example it can

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,560
generate QR codes? I said create a QR code that I can scan with my phone to reach the following URL

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,760
and lo and behold it creates it and yes it does work. Maybe I'm easily impressed but I think

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:31,040
that's pretty amazing and what about a 3d scatter plot? This is truly remarkable. I uploaded the data

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:40,240
from Gatminder and it created this chart based on the median age of over 100 countries from 1950 I

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,560
think projected to 2100 and I asked highlight the UK that this is indeed the UK's median age

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
through those years in red but I know what you might be thinking that is amazing that it's 3d

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,320
and interactive but the blue kind of merges and it's hard to see what's going on. I engaged in a

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,560
conversation and look what it created. It picked out the 30 most populous countries and separated

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,080
them off with separate colors. Look at that that is gorgeous. Now you might have the critique that the

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,040
median age is in descending order in the y-axis going from 20 down to 60 so in a sense the median

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,480
age is actually rising not falling but nevertheless that's easily amendable and that is truly an

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,520
incredible diagram and look just for fun I'm going to go into the data look at this I'm traveling

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,280
into the data this is so wild I don't know how helpful it is but I think that's just beautiful

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,840
and crazy. There are so many industries data analytics accounting consultancy that this will

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,480
affect. By the way it got all of this done in about a minute. I see a lot of people online

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,840
talking about five seconds later is no way done in five seconds you have to wait 30 seconds a

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
minute sometimes much longer before I move on I want to give you a killer tip that it took me

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,440
quite a while to work out so when you get access try to remember this say output the visualization

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,520
as a downloadable file if you don't add that phrase as a downloadable file what will happen

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,280
is it often gets stuck at this stage of the code it'll either say fig dot show or plot dot show

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,080
and then just stop I found that I encountered this problem far less often if I said output a

36
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,840
downloadable file next did you know that code interpreter can do optical character recognition

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,080
I screenshotted this text from a New York Times article I think it was and I asked OCR the text

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,120
in this image and write a poem in Danish about it now I don't want to exaggerate it often gets OCR

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
wrong I don't want to get your hopes up it fails more often than it succeeds but when it works

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,240
it can do it understood the text and then did a poem in Danish about the text now I'm going to

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,120
need a Danish speaker to tell me if that was a good poem but either way it could do it how about

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,880
this one it can do interactive time series with range sliders and selectors I uploaded a CSV file

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,480
on life expectancy data from the entire world and I just said can you pick out the US UK and

44
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,720
India and create a time series with range slider and selectors again that killer phrase output a

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,080
downloadable file and here is what it came up with notice how the life expectancy for all three

46
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,800
countries rises during the 20th century and look how I can select down here interactively

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,600
a range of the data and even by clicking up here a 10-year interval or 50-year interval

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,720
here's the crazy thing I did nothing I just uploaded the file there were hundreds of countries in

49
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,840
there you can see here all the steps that it did and if you click on the arrow you get to see the

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,120
actual code but then it goes through shows its explanation and eventually gives you a link that

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,760
you can simply click and get the file downloaded and if you weren't that impressed already here's

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,680
where it gets fairly game-changing you can get it to do the data analytics not just the visualizations

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,680
for example I said find five unexpected non-obvious insights from this data and offer plausible

54
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,880
explanations for them this was back to the median age data for the most interesting observation

55
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,640
provide a compelling and clear visualization now ignore the first diagram which wasn't that good

56
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,160
because of the x-axis but look at the insights this is data analytics you can see here that the

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,640
original file was called median age years and it was just a table of data no analysis whatsoever

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,400
but look what GPT-4 picked out insight one the global median age has been steadily increasing

59
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,440
over time it calculated the global median age that wasn't included in the data it was just

60
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,000
country data and it says it's gone from around 22 years to over 38 years in 2023 and it's projected

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,640
to continue rising to approximately 44 years by 2100 and then it offers a cogent explanation

62
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,920
this trend is likely due to a combination of increasing life expectancy and decreasing

63
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,200
fertility rates worldwide as medical technology improves more people are living longer birth rates

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,280
are declining particularly in developed regions it's picked this all out and then it moves on to

65
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,320
the next insight the countries that have seen the most significant increases in median age are these

66
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,680
ones and again it gives an explanation as to why their median age might have risen more than any

67
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,800
other for example Albania has seen significant emigration of younger people which could also

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,480
lead to an older median age is it me or is that kind of crazy that it crunched all the data

69
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,720
visualized it but then also gave really interesting analyses of the data now you can read the other

70
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,400
analyses but each of them are really interesting and the final visualization which I asked for

71
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,760
is brilliant I think notice how the graph goes from green to red when you get to the future

72
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,200
projection I didn't ask it to do that now obviously in this video I'm going to focus on the flashy

73
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,160
visuals and the cool little tricks it can do but in terms of data analytics that is what is going

74
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,320
to change jobs change industries and remember this is code interpreter alpha version one look at the

75
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,600
difference between mid-journey version one and now mid-journey version five a year later how about

76
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,440
basic video editing now there is a limit to what it can do but it can do some basic video editing

77
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,240
if you ask it for example I uploaded a short file and asked it to rotate the file 180 degrees

78
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,320
and it was able to do it now I'm not saying that is massively useful but it was able to do it here

79
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,560
is a similar example I uploaded an image file and then said can you zoom out from the center of the

80
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,000
image now initially it did zoom in but then I clarified that I wanted it to zoom out from the

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,320
center just to be cheeky I also asked can you make it black and white oh and I also asked to add music

82
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,680
but it couldn't add music anyway here is the end result by the way it gave it to me as an mp4 file

83
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,960
and look it zooms out from the center and it's made the image black and white now because I got

84
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,080
access so recently I honestly haven't explored the limits of what kind of video editing I can do

85
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,840
with chat gpt code interpreter but I will let you know when I can now back to visualizations I gave

86
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,440
it a hypothetical scenario that sounds kind of realistic I sent 231 cvs got 32 responses 12 phone

87
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,440
interviews three follow-up face-to-face interviews and one job offer which I rejected output a

88
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,320
downloadable sanki diagram of this data I did then get it to change the coloring slightly but I think

89
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,760
that's a pretty cool sanki diagram look sent cvs 231 and then receive responses and you can go down

90
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,320
32 phone interviews 12 face-to-face interviews and three job offers and one rejected offer

91
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,280
obviously I could have tweaked that for hours make it more visual make it more interactive maybe

92
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,960
make a gif of it but for two minutes work I think that's a pretty interesting and incredible output

93
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,800
next and here is one that you might say is a little bit concerning and it's about steganography

94
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,600
now I will admit I am not at all an expert in fact I know virtually nothing about it essentially what

95
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,520
it involves though is hiding a message inside an image or inside some code and gpt 4 was more

96
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,920
than willing to play along and it encoded a secret message into an image there is the image by the way

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,080
and if you looked at that you'd think that's totally normal that's just a silly little image

98
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,320
right well apparently here's what it can do to a casual observer it looks like a simple image

99
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,000
with some shapes but it actually contains the hidden message hello world then it provided a python

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,920
function which can be used to decode the message from the image now obviously this is just a silly

101
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,040
example that is totally harmless but I might be in crazy in thinking this is a somewhat concerning

102
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,560
ability for future language models to possess especially when they reach the level of an agi

103
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,480
often open ai talk about future versions of gpt doing scientific research and finding things

104
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,960
that humans wouldn't have discovered but let me pose the scenario that it gets better than

105
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,200
any human expert at steganography anyway enough from me I'll let the experts weigh in on that one

106
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,680
next did you know that gpt 4 with code interpreter can do text to speech just before anyone comments

107
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,680
though why did I write proceed without further question because gpt 4 with code interpreter has

108
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,840
a tendency to always ask clarifying questions and if you have access to only 25 messages every three

109
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,040
hours you don't want to use up half or more of them on clarifying what it wants to do or saying

110
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,320
yes please do that but I found writing proceed without further question means it gets straight to

111
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,440
it and essentially you get double the number of prompts for your money anyway as you can see I asked

112
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,360
turn this entire prompt starting from the beginning into a text to speech file now quite a few times

113
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
it denied it had the ability to do this but eventually I got it to work it was actually

114
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,720
when I finally gave it this prompt and it worked I say worked but it didn't quite work as intended

115
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,680
check it out here is the text to speech that it came up with you are at gpt a large language

116
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,040
model trained by open ai when you send a message containing python code to python it will be executed

117
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,520
in a stateful jupiter notebook environment python will respond with the output of the execution

118
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,840
or timeout after 120.0 seconds internet access for this session is disabled do not make external

119
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,720
web requests or API call must fail now thank you Stephen Hawking for that message the only thing

120
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,360
is it had nothing to do with my original prompt now anyway when you get access to code interpreter

121
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,800
play about with text to speech because it is able to do it even if it denies it time for a fun one

122
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,600
I asked create a tree map of the letters in the following quote and I'm not going to read it out

123
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,560
because I am not good at tongue twisters anyway I said give each part of the tree map a different

124
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,560
color and output a downloadable file proceed without further question and here is the output

125
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,160
and I checked it for the letter p and it was correct that there were 36 instances of the letter p

126
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,400
in the output and look how it's proportional with the number of instances of the letter

127
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,760
and the size of each rectangle I think that is pretty insane okay back to something more serious

128
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,360
I uploaded this file which is an image of a math problem quite a hard one as well and you guessed

129
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,640
I said solve the math problem in this image it then extracted the text from the image

130
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,920
presumably using OCR and then proceeded to solve it and I'm going to get on to this in a second

131
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,280
it is better at math than Wolfram Alpha I know that's a big claim but it's far less buggy I

132
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,040
found Wolfram Alpha crashing very frequently anyway here are the two solutions and isn't that

133
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,080
incredible from a photo essentially it then extracts out the math problem including the two

134
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,920
square roots and then solves it this is all within the same window of chat tpt no need for any other

135
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,840
apps or extensions next it can do radial bar plots which I think are really quite beautiful I'm not

136
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,640
saying this is the best one ever and I'm sure you could tweak it to make it more clear and beautiful

137
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,720
look at that the life expectancy in the US climbing from 1800 and then it goes clockwise

138
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,280
reaching a projected almost 90 by 2100 again I'm sure you could do a far better job than me in

139
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,480
extracting out a more beautiful diagram but aren't radial bar plots just beautiful to look at

140
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,000
speaking of cool diagrams how about this I didn't even specify which visualization to do I uploaded

141
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
this same life expectancy data and I just said what are the most advanced and technical visualizations

142
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,880
you can do with this data proceed to do them now honestly it picks some visualizations that I don't

143
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,800
think are the most advanced but nevertheless it was creative here is what it did it does frequently

144
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,480
make the mistake of cluttering the axes and having far too many labels so that you can't see anything

145
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,520
so scrub that one out not great but what about the next few remember it just did this on its own

146
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,640
this is a heat map and you can see some really interesting things from this data like India

147
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,840
starting with a much lower life expectancy than anyone else but gradually rising but still falling

148
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:01,200
behind the others even in 2100 and look at China look how the life expectancy drops in the 60s and

149
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,240
70s I think we all know what happened there compare that to the US which is a gradual

150
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,680
continual ascent actually aside from 2020 look how the shade gets a little darker in 2020 obviously

151
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,000
you guys can probably work out what happened around then but then the projections are for

152
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,240
it to go up toward 90 by 2100 that's a beautiful and clear heat map that I didn't even ask for

153
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,040
it to do let's look at the next one box plot do you remember those from school you get the

154
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,880
upper end of the data the highest one the lowest one the median the first quartile and third quartile

155
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,320
and it's a great way of statistically representing a set of data and it's done it for every 50th

156
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,920
year starting in 1900 obviously a slightly less beautiful diagram than some of the ones you've

157
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,280
seen today but for the statisticians in the audience you will know that this is a very useful

158
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,720
metric for a lot of data the individual points above and below are typically when there are

159
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,400
outliers in the data I would estimate that all of these visualizations only took around

160
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,920
two two and a half minutes so definitely not the 10 seconds as I said that you often see on Twitter

161
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,120
I mean have you ever seen GPT-4 give an answer in less than 10 seconds speaking of useful I think

162
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,560
many professionals will find the next thing that I'm about to showcase the most useful of all any

163
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:25,440
insights that GPT-4 finds trends medians analyses whatever you can ask it to add to the original

164
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,200
file and then download it do you remember that the original file was called median age years well

165
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,000
notice this file name median age years with insights it has created a downloadable new file

166
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,080
with the insights included and look at some of the insights that I mean you have the change from

167
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:52,160
1950 to 2100 and here is the average median age throughout the period and the change from 2023

168
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,160
to 2100 notice that the original file didn't have those columns they were added by GPT-4

169
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,440
with code interpreter and now how about data progression video files I was honestly shocked

170
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,160
when I saw that it could do this but I asked can you make a 256 by 256 mp4 that gradually reveals

171
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,160
the lines as they progress on the x-axis this was about the median age over time here is what it did

172
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,680
and look at how the data and the chart progresses as time moves along I was really shocked to see this

173
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,400
and the line in red which is going to be labeled at the end is the global median age and remember

174
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,520
it calculated that that wasn't in the original file now I'm not sure why it picked out these four

175
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,480
countries maybe because they represent extremes but either way I think the result is phenomenal

176
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,800
and I'm genuinely impressed that it did this even though I know the final result could be improved

177
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,040
dramatically for example far higher resolution and maybe the global median age labeled from the start

178
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,960
and actually now that it's got to the end I can see why it did pick out these countries

179
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,960
because Niger did have the lowest median age in 2100 and it looks like Puerto Rico had the

180
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,560
highest and the fastest aging one was Albania next and this is going to shock quite a few people

181
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,080
what about image editing I created this image in mid-journey version five and then here's what I

182
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,960
asked I said use opencv to select the foreground of this image and look what it did it picked out

183
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,640
the foreground no blue sky now I know it's not perfect but it's nevertheless impressive all

184
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,840
within the window of chat bt this does actually make me wonder if open ai and chat bt is eventually

185
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,480
not now but in a few years gonna swallow all other apps or maybe google's gemini but either way one

186
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,400
interface one website one app doing the job of all others and by the way of course chat bt is now

187
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,480
available on ios but imagine you have one app and it can do image editing text to speech video

188
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,120
editing everything data analysis not at gpt4 levels but gpt6 or gpt7 levels if you can get every

189
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,880
piece of information service and application in one interface a bit like now people being addicted

190
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,840
to their smartphones won't people be addicted to this one interface again that's not going to happen

191
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,080
now but i'm just posing it as a question to think over for the moment though before anyone gets too

192
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,880
carried away it does still hallucinate quite a lot so I uploaded this image and I asked it questions

193
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,240
about it and it answered and I was like wow it can do image recognition it said this image appears to

194
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,000
be a digital painting of a humanoid figure at a desk with a rather complex background I was initially

195
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,520
amazed until I realized that it probably got that from the file name because when I asked it questions

196
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,920
it got it wrong so I said what is on the desk now look back there's this weird kind of microphone and

197
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,360
a bit of paper and not much else a keyboard and look what it said there are multiple floating

198
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,000
holographic displays okay a mouse not really a desk lamp I can't see that and then tools and

199
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,880
devices now correct me if I'm wrong but I think most of those are incorrect now obviously I need

200
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,840
to do far more experiments to see if it actually can recognize any particular images and maybe I'm

201
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,880
putting it down too harshly but at the moment it does seem to hallucinate if you ask it about too

202
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,160
much of the detail of an image next you remember how one of the key weaknesses of gt4 is that it

203
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,840
can't really count things especially not characters words etc and even more so it can't do division

204
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,960
and some of you might be thinking well with wolfram alpha it can do those things not quite here is

205
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,120
an example of the code interpreter plugin essentially eating wolfram alpha obviating it making it not

206
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,320
obvious what the utility of it is if you've got code interpreter I asked divide the number of the

207
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,360
letter e's in this prompt by the number of the letter t's now you might think code interpreter

208
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,000
can improve things by doing the character counting but it can also do the division notice how it

209
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,120
counted the characters correctly compared to wolfram alpha and of course got the division

210
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,360
correct as well so if it can do advanced quadratics and do division and character counting etc it does

211
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,480
beg the question what would we use wolfram alpha for that we can't use code interpreter for I

212
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
honestly might not know something that you guys know so do let me know in the comments it also

213
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,520
got this math question correct and notice you get these beautiful math visuals that you don't get

214
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,960
with the base version of gpt4 you get something more like this where the visuals aren't as clear

215
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,760
and notice the base version of gpt4 gets the question wrong it can't do division but with

216
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,560
code interpreter it gets the question right next one is a quick one pie charts nothing too special

217
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,920
but I think it is a fairly beautiful visualization it doesn't seem to matter how big the csv file

218
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,760
is that you upload this next example was really quite fascinating it was a word puzzle I have

219
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,520
tried this particular word puzzle on gpt4 dozens of times the reason I picked this puzzle it's called

220
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,360
a word ladder is because it really struggles with the puzzle if the number of steps required is more

221
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,800
than a certain number usually about five or six steps it gave me a really interesting border of

222
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,320
the limits of gpt4's planning abilities with language anyway it always gets it wrong here is

223
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,240
a demonstration with the base model of gpt4 you might say why is this wrong but look at how it's

224
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,920
changed from seas to sags which is more than one letter change and that's typical of the kind of

225
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,040
errors it makes what about with code interpreter well you can probably guess the ending given that I

226
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,600
featured it in the video but it gets it right I believe it draws upon a hard-coded word set and

227
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,640
this does point towards the kind of puzzles that I think gpt4 with code interpreter will be able to

228
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,240
solve things like crosswords and sedokus okay not exactly world-changing but nevertheless

229
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,360
I think quite fascinating and how about Venn diagrams the reason I picked this example is that

230
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,120
I had to go through about 10 steps to get it to create this rather basic three-way Venn diagram

231
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,280
this represents the overlap between dogs AI and desks and apparently all of them are loyal companions

232
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,440
well we will see about that but anyway it took quite a few steps to get it right which is pretty

233
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,480
annoying but here's the really interesting thing once I got it set up in the way that I like

234
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,040
all I had to do was say use the format above to create a new three-way Venn diagram this time

235
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:15,600
for mangoes movie heroes and marmosets try to make each entry funny and use different colors

236
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,600
proceed without further questions so it may have been a struggle to set up initially but once done

237
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,000
it was so easy to iterate a new three-way Venn diagram and actually it was better than the

238
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,120
original apparently all three are adored by fans worldwide apparently only marmosets and

239
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,040
movie heroes can climb up trees really fast and mangoes and marmosets can hang upside down

240
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,800
that's crazy one or two prompts iterating on a design already agreed upon this is honestly

241
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,680
what is likely to happen in the future with people spending hours to find the perfect data

242
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:56,000
visualization or piece of data analysis and then just hitting copy paste for all their other files

243
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,280
perfect it once and then it does the rest for you a quick couple of bonus ones before I finish

244
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,280
you can just ask it to come up with a visualization giving it no direction at all it came up with a

245
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,560
distribution of prime numbers up to ten thousand thing is I believe there's a slight mistake at

246
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,080
the beginning because I think there's only 25 in the first 100 and 21 in the next 100 so you

247
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,040
probably do want to still check the outputs that code interpreter gives you and that's another reason

248
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,320
it's not going to instantly replace all data analysis and data visualization it's not perfect

249
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,040
and it's not fully reliable but you've got to look ahead to where things are going I'm going to end

250
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:42,400
where I started with this insane 3d surface map of a volcano if this is what gpc4 can do now with

251
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:52,080
the alpha version of code interpreter what will gpc5 or 6 do with version 7 or 20 of code interpreter

252
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,200
I was about to speculate about that but then I got distracted with trying to get inside this

253
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,320
volcano it is kind of fun and look I'm going above and into the volcano let me know what you

254
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,720
will try when you get access I know they're rolling it out steadily and I know that some people have

255
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,760
had access to it for about three weeks so hopefully if you want to experiment with it you will be able

256
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,720
too soon in the meantime do let me know if you have any ideas that you want me to experiment with

257
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,960
and thank you so much for watching all the way to the end have a wonderful day
