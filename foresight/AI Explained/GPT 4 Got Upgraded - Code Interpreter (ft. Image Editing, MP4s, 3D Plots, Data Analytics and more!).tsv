0	4800	I just got access to the code interpreter plugin about 48 hours ago and have been running
4800	10000	experiments on it non-stop since then. I've come up with about 18 examples to show you guys its
10000	15280	power. Most of them I reckon haven't been seen before. I predict many industries will have to
15280	19840	update overnight when it's released more widely and at the end of the video please let me know
19840	24640	what you think and what other experiments that we can try. First though, what about this one?
24640	29360	A 3D surface plot. Just quickly, the way it works is you click this little button to the
29360	35200	left of the text box and then you can upload many different file types like CSV files, word files,
35200	40400	images and even short videos. Then it will automatically analyze the file type without
40400	46560	you pressing anything and then of course you give it a prompt and as with all of chatbt it becomes a
46560	52400	conversation. So the first 3d surface plot was decent but it was too small so I simply said in
52400	56880	natural language can you make it four times bigger thank you and of course you have seen the
56880	61440	amazing end result even with the lighting. Look at these shadows there. I believe this is based
61440	67120	on a real contour map of a volcano in New Zealand and I could do a whole video just on this but I
67120	72640	have 17 other examples to get to but this one was truly amazing. Did you know for example it can
72640	78560	generate QR codes? I said create a QR code that I can scan with my phone to reach the following URL
78560	83760	and lo and behold it creates it and yes it does work. Maybe I'm easily impressed but I think
83760	91040	that's pretty amazing and what about a 3d scatter plot? This is truly remarkable. I uploaded the data
91040	100240	from Gatminder and it created this chart based on the median age of over 100 countries from 1950 I
100240	108560	think projected to 2100 and I asked highlight the UK that this is indeed the UK's median age
108560	113360	through those years in red but I know what you might be thinking that is amazing that it's 3d
113440	118320	and interactive but the blue kind of merges and it's hard to see what's going on. I engaged in a
118320	124560	conversation and look what it created. It picked out the 30 most populous countries and separated
124560	132080	them off with separate colors. Look at that that is gorgeous. Now you might have the critique that the
132080	139040	median age is in descending order in the y-axis going from 20 down to 60 so in a sense the median
139040	144480	age is actually rising not falling but nevertheless that's easily amendable and that is truly an
144480	149520	incredible diagram and look just for fun I'm going to go into the data look at this I'm traveling
149520	155280	into the data this is so wild I don't know how helpful it is but I think that's just beautiful
156000	163840	and crazy. There are so many industries data analytics accounting consultancy that this will
163840	168480	affect. By the way it got all of this done in about a minute. I see a lot of people online
168480	173840	talking about five seconds later is no way done in five seconds you have to wait 30 seconds a
173840	179120	minute sometimes much longer before I move on I want to give you a killer tip that it took me
179120	185440	quite a while to work out so when you get access try to remember this say output the visualization
185440	191520	as a downloadable file if you don't add that phrase as a downloadable file what will happen
191520	197280	is it often gets stuck at this stage of the code it'll either say fig dot show or plot dot show
197280	202080	and then just stop I found that I encountered this problem far less often if I said output a
202080	207840	downloadable file next did you know that code interpreter can do optical character recognition
207840	214080	I screenshotted this text from a New York Times article I think it was and I asked OCR the text
214080	221120	in this image and write a poem in Danish about it now I don't want to exaggerate it often gets OCR
221120	226400	wrong I don't want to get your hopes up it fails more often than it succeeds but when it works
226400	232240	it can do it understood the text and then did a poem in Danish about the text now I'm going to
232240	237120	need a Danish speaker to tell me if that was a good poem but either way it could do it how about
237120	244880	this one it can do interactive time series with range sliders and selectors I uploaded a CSV file
244880	250480	on life expectancy data from the entire world and I just said can you pick out the US UK and
250480	256720	India and create a time series with range slider and selectors again that killer phrase output a
256720	262080	downloadable file and here is what it came up with notice how the life expectancy for all three
262080	268800	countries rises during the 20th century and look how I can select down here interactively
269600	275600	a range of the data and even by clicking up here a 10-year interval or 50-year interval
275680	280720	here's the crazy thing I did nothing I just uploaded the file there were hundreds of countries in
280720	285840	there you can see here all the steps that it did and if you click on the arrow you get to see the
285840	291120	actual code but then it goes through shows its explanation and eventually gives you a link that
291120	295760	you can simply click and get the file downloaded and if you weren't that impressed already here's
295760	301680	where it gets fairly game-changing you can get it to do the data analytics not just the visualizations
301680	307680	for example I said find five unexpected non-obvious insights from this data and offer plausible
307680	312880	explanations for them this was back to the median age data for the most interesting observation
312880	318640	provide a compelling and clear visualization now ignore the first diagram which wasn't that good
318640	324160	because of the x-axis but look at the insights this is data analytics you can see here that the
324160	330640	original file was called median age years and it was just a table of data no analysis whatsoever
330640	336400	but look what GPT-4 picked out insight one the global median age has been steadily increasing
336400	341440	over time it calculated the global median age that wasn't included in the data it was just
341440	348000	country data and it says it's gone from around 22 years to over 38 years in 2023 and it's projected
348000	354640	to continue rising to approximately 44 years by 2100 and then it offers a cogent explanation
354640	359920	this trend is likely due to a combination of increasing life expectancy and decreasing
359920	365200	fertility rates worldwide as medical technology improves more people are living longer birth rates
365200	369280	are declining particularly in developed regions it's picked this all out and then it moves on to
369280	374320	the next insight the countries that have seen the most significant increases in median age are these
374320	379680	ones and again it gives an explanation as to why their median age might have risen more than any
379680	384800	other for example Albania has seen significant emigration of younger people which could also
384800	390480	lead to an older median age is it me or is that kind of crazy that it crunched all the data
390480	396720	visualized it but then also gave really interesting analyses of the data now you can read the other
396720	402400	analyses but each of them are really interesting and the final visualization which I asked for
402400	407760	is brilliant I think notice how the graph goes from green to red when you get to the future
407760	413200	projection I didn't ask it to do that now obviously in this video I'm going to focus on the flashy
413200	418160	visuals and the cool little tricks it can do but in terms of data analytics that is what is going
418160	424320	to change jobs change industries and remember this is code interpreter alpha version one look at the
424320	429600	difference between mid-journey version one and now mid-journey version five a year later how about
429600	435440	basic video editing now there is a limit to what it can do but it can do some basic video editing
435440	442240	if you ask it for example I uploaded a short file and asked it to rotate the file 180 degrees
442240	448320	and it was able to do it now I'm not saying that is massively useful but it was able to do it here
448320	454560	is a similar example I uploaded an image file and then said can you zoom out from the center of the
454560	460000	image now initially it did zoom in but then I clarified that I wanted it to zoom out from the
460000	466320	center just to be cheeky I also asked can you make it black and white oh and I also asked to add music
466320	473680	but it couldn't add music anyway here is the end result by the way it gave it to me as an mp4 file
473680	478960	and look it zooms out from the center and it's made the image black and white now because I got
478960	484080	access so recently I honestly haven't explored the limits of what kind of video editing I can do
484080	489840	with chat gpt code interpreter but I will let you know when I can now back to visualizations I gave
489840	497440	it a hypothetical scenario that sounds kind of realistic I sent 231 cvs got 32 responses 12 phone
497440	503440	interviews three follow-up face-to-face interviews and one job offer which I rejected output a
503440	510320	downloadable sanki diagram of this data I did then get it to change the coloring slightly but I think
510320	517760	that's a pretty cool sanki diagram look sent cvs 231 and then receive responses and you can go down
517840	524320	32 phone interviews 12 face-to-face interviews and three job offers and one rejected offer
524320	529280	obviously I could have tweaked that for hours make it more visual make it more interactive maybe
529280	534960	make a gif of it but for two minutes work I think that's a pretty interesting and incredible output
534960	540800	next and here is one that you might say is a little bit concerning and it's about steganography
540800	545600	now I will admit I am not at all an expert in fact I know virtually nothing about it essentially what
545600	551520	it involves though is hiding a message inside an image or inside some code and gpt 4 was more
551520	557920	than willing to play along and it encoded a secret message into an image there is the image by the way
557920	562080	and if you looked at that you'd think that's totally normal that's just a silly little image
562080	566320	right well apparently here's what it can do to a casual observer it looks like a simple image
566320	572000	with some shapes but it actually contains the hidden message hello world then it provided a python
572000	577920	function which can be used to decode the message from the image now obviously this is just a silly
577920	583040	example that is totally harmless but I might be in crazy in thinking this is a somewhat concerning
583040	588560	ability for future language models to possess especially when they reach the level of an agi
588560	594480	often open ai talk about future versions of gpt doing scientific research and finding things
594480	598960	that humans wouldn't have discovered but let me pose the scenario that it gets better than
598960	605200	any human expert at steganography anyway enough from me I'll let the experts weigh in on that one
605200	611680	next did you know that gpt 4 with code interpreter can do text to speech just before anyone comments
611680	617680	though why did I write proceed without further question because gpt 4 with code interpreter has
617680	623840	a tendency to always ask clarifying questions and if you have access to only 25 messages every three
623840	629040	hours you don't want to use up half or more of them on clarifying what it wants to do or saying
629040	634320	yes please do that but I found writing proceed without further question means it gets straight to
634320	639440	it and essentially you get double the number of prompts for your money anyway as you can see I asked
639440	645360	turn this entire prompt starting from the beginning into a text to speech file now quite a few times
645360	650480	it denied it had the ability to do this but eventually I got it to work it was actually
650480	656720	when I finally gave it this prompt and it worked I say worked but it didn't quite work as intended
656720	661680	check it out here is the text to speech that it came up with you are at gpt a large language
661680	667040	model trained by open ai when you send a message containing python code to python it will be executed
667040	671520	in a stateful jupiter notebook environment python will respond with the output of the execution
671520	677840	or timeout after 120.0 seconds internet access for this session is disabled do not make external
678080	682720	web requests or API call must fail now thank you Stephen Hawking for that message the only thing
682720	687360	is it had nothing to do with my original prompt now anyway when you get access to code interpreter
687360	692800	play about with text to speech because it is able to do it even if it denies it time for a fun one
692800	697600	I asked create a tree map of the letters in the following quote and I'm not going to read it out
697600	702560	because I am not good at tongue twisters anyway I said give each part of the tree map a different
702560	708560	color and output a downloadable file proceed without further question and here is the output
708560	714160	and I checked it for the letter p and it was correct that there were 36 instances of the letter p
714160	718400	in the output and look how it's proportional with the number of instances of the letter
718400	723760	and the size of each rectangle I think that is pretty insane okay back to something more serious
723760	729360	I uploaded this file which is an image of a math problem quite a hard one as well and you guessed
729840	734640	I said solve the math problem in this image it then extracted the text from the image
734640	739920	presumably using OCR and then proceeded to solve it and I'm going to get on to this in a second
739920	745280	it is better at math than Wolfram Alpha I know that's a big claim but it's far less buggy I
745280	751040	found Wolfram Alpha crashing very frequently anyway here are the two solutions and isn't that
751040	756080	incredible from a photo essentially it then extracts out the math problem including the two
756080	761920	square roots and then solves it this is all within the same window of chat tpt no need for any other
761920	767840	apps or extensions next it can do radial bar plots which I think are really quite beautiful I'm not
767840	772640	saying this is the best one ever and I'm sure you could tweak it to make it more clear and beautiful
772640	778720	look at that the life expectancy in the US climbing from 1800 and then it goes clockwise
778720	785280	reaching a projected almost 90 by 2100 again I'm sure you could do a far better job than me in
785280	790480	extracting out a more beautiful diagram but aren't radial bar plots just beautiful to look at
790480	796000	speaking of cool diagrams how about this I didn't even specify which visualization to do I uploaded
796000	802000	this same life expectancy data and I just said what are the most advanced and technical visualizations
802000	806880	you can do with this data proceed to do them now honestly it picks some visualizations that I don't
806880	812800	think are the most advanced but nevertheless it was creative here is what it did it does frequently
812800	818480	make the mistake of cluttering the axes and having far too many labels so that you can't see anything
818480	823520	so scrub that one out not great but what about the next few remember it just did this on its own
823520	828640	this is a heat map and you can see some really interesting things from this data like India
828640	833840	starting with a much lower life expectancy than anyone else but gradually rising but still falling
833840	841200	behind the others even in 2100 and look at China look how the life expectancy drops in the 60s and
841280	846240	70s I think we all know what happened there compare that to the US which is a gradual
846240	853680	continual ascent actually aside from 2020 look how the shade gets a little darker in 2020 obviously
853680	858000	you guys can probably work out what happened around then but then the projections are for
858000	864240	it to go up toward 90 by 2100 that's a beautiful and clear heat map that I didn't even ask for
864240	869040	it to do let's look at the next one box plot do you remember those from school you get the
869040	874880	upper end of the data the highest one the lowest one the median the first quartile and third quartile
874880	880320	and it's a great way of statistically representing a set of data and it's done it for every 50th
880320	885920	year starting in 1900 obviously a slightly less beautiful diagram than some of the ones you've
885920	891280	seen today but for the statisticians in the audience you will know that this is a very useful
891280	896720	metric for a lot of data the individual points above and below are typically when there are
896720	902400	outliers in the data I would estimate that all of these visualizations only took around
902400	907920	two two and a half minutes so definitely not the 10 seconds as I said that you often see on Twitter
907920	913120	I mean have you ever seen GPT-4 give an answer in less than 10 seconds speaking of useful I think
913120	918560	many professionals will find the next thing that I'm about to showcase the most useful of all any
918560	925440	insights that GPT-4 finds trends medians analyses whatever you can ask it to add to the original
925440	931200	file and then download it do you remember that the original file was called median age years well
931200	938000	notice this file name median age years with insights it has created a downloadable new file
938000	944080	with the insights included and look at some of the insights that I mean you have the change from
944080	952160	1950 to 2100 and here is the average median age throughout the period and the change from 2023
952240	958160	to 2100 notice that the original file didn't have those columns they were added by GPT-4
958160	963440	with code interpreter and now how about data progression video files I was honestly shocked
963440	970160	when I saw that it could do this but I asked can you make a 256 by 256 mp4 that gradually reveals
970160	976160	the lines as they progress on the x-axis this was about the median age over time here is what it did
976160	983680	and look at how the data and the chart progresses as time moves along I was really shocked to see this
983680	990400	and the line in red which is going to be labeled at the end is the global median age and remember
990400	995520	it calculated that that wasn't in the original file now I'm not sure why it picked out these four
995520	1002480	countries maybe because they represent extremes but either way I think the result is phenomenal
1002480	1008800	and I'm genuinely impressed that it did this even though I know the final result could be improved
1008800	1015040	dramatically for example far higher resolution and maybe the global median age labeled from the start
1015040	1018960	and actually now that it's got to the end I can see why it did pick out these countries
1018960	1024960	because Niger did have the lowest median age in 2100 and it looks like Puerto Rico had the
1024960	1030560	highest and the fastest aging one was Albania next and this is going to shock quite a few people
1030560	1036080	what about image editing I created this image in mid-journey version five and then here's what I
1036080	1042960	asked I said use opencv to select the foreground of this image and look what it did it picked out
1042960	1048640	the foreground no blue sky now I know it's not perfect but it's nevertheless impressive all
1048640	1055840	within the window of chat bt this does actually make me wonder if open ai and chat bt is eventually
1055840	1062480	not now but in a few years gonna swallow all other apps or maybe google's gemini but either way one
1062480	1068400	interface one website one app doing the job of all others and by the way of course chat bt is now
1068400	1074480	available on ios but imagine you have one app and it can do image editing text to speech video
1074480	1081120	editing everything data analysis not at gpt4 levels but gpt6 or gpt7 levels if you can get every
1081120	1086880	piece of information service and application in one interface a bit like now people being addicted
1086880	1091840	to their smartphones won't people be addicted to this one interface again that's not going to happen
1091840	1096080	now but i'm just posing it as a question to think over for the moment though before anyone gets too
1096080	1100880	carried away it does still hallucinate quite a lot so I uploaded this image and I asked it questions
1100880	1106240	about it and it answered and I was like wow it can do image recognition it said this image appears to
1106240	1112000	be a digital painting of a humanoid figure at a desk with a rather complex background I was initially
1112000	1117520	amazed until I realized that it probably got that from the file name because when I asked it questions
1117520	1123920	it got it wrong so I said what is on the desk now look back there's this weird kind of microphone and
1123920	1129360	a bit of paper and not much else a keyboard and look what it said there are multiple floating
1129360	1136000	holographic displays okay a mouse not really a desk lamp I can't see that and then tools and
1136080	1140880	devices now correct me if I'm wrong but I think most of those are incorrect now obviously I need
1140880	1145840	to do far more experiments to see if it actually can recognize any particular images and maybe I'm
1145840	1150880	putting it down too harshly but at the moment it does seem to hallucinate if you ask it about too
1150880	1156160	much of the detail of an image next you remember how one of the key weaknesses of gt4 is that it
1156160	1161840	can't really count things especially not characters words etc and even more so it can't do division
1161840	1166960	and some of you might be thinking well with wolfram alpha it can do those things not quite here is
1166960	1173120	an example of the code interpreter plugin essentially eating wolfram alpha obviating it making it not
1173120	1178320	obvious what the utility of it is if you've got code interpreter I asked divide the number of the
1178320	1183360	letter e's in this prompt by the number of the letter t's now you might think code interpreter
1183360	1188000	can improve things by doing the character counting but it can also do the division notice how it
1188080	1193120	counted the characters correctly compared to wolfram alpha and of course got the division
1193120	1199360	correct as well so if it can do advanced quadratics and do division and character counting etc it does
1199360	1204480	beg the question what would we use wolfram alpha for that we can't use code interpreter for I
1204480	1208720	honestly might not know something that you guys know so do let me know in the comments it also
1208720	1213520	got this math question correct and notice you get these beautiful math visuals that you don't get
1213520	1218960	with the base version of gpt4 you get something more like this where the visuals aren't as clear
1218960	1223760	and notice the base version of gpt4 gets the question wrong it can't do division but with
1223760	1228560	code interpreter it gets the question right next one is a quick one pie charts nothing too special
1228560	1233920	but I think it is a fairly beautiful visualization it doesn't seem to matter how big the csv file
1233920	1239760	is that you upload this next example was really quite fascinating it was a word puzzle I have
1239760	1245520	tried this particular word puzzle on gpt4 dozens of times the reason I picked this puzzle it's called
1245520	1251360	a word ladder is because it really struggles with the puzzle if the number of steps required is more
1251360	1256800	than a certain number usually about five or six steps it gave me a really interesting border of
1256800	1262320	the limits of gpt4's planning abilities with language anyway it always gets it wrong here is
1262320	1268240	a demonstration with the base model of gpt4 you might say why is this wrong but look at how it's
1268240	1273920	changed from seas to sags which is more than one letter change and that's typical of the kind of
1273920	1279040	errors it makes what about with code interpreter well you can probably guess the ending given that I
1279040	1285600	featured it in the video but it gets it right I believe it draws upon a hard-coded word set and
1285600	1290640	this does point towards the kind of puzzles that I think gpt4 with code interpreter will be able to
1290640	1296240	solve things like crosswords and sedokus okay not exactly world-changing but nevertheless
1296240	1301360	I think quite fascinating and how about Venn diagrams the reason I picked this example is that
1301360	1307120	I had to go through about 10 steps to get it to create this rather basic three-way Venn diagram
1307120	1313280	this represents the overlap between dogs AI and desks and apparently all of them are loyal companions
1313280	1317440	well we will see about that but anyway it took quite a few steps to get it right which is pretty
1317440	1322480	annoying but here's the really interesting thing once I got it set up in the way that I like
1322480	1329040	all I had to do was say use the format above to create a new three-way Venn diagram this time
1329040	1335600	for mangoes movie heroes and marmosets try to make each entry funny and use different colors
1335600	1341600	proceed without further questions so it may have been a struggle to set up initially but once done
1341600	1348000	it was so easy to iterate a new three-way Venn diagram and actually it was better than the
1348000	1353120	original apparently all three are adored by fans worldwide apparently only marmosets and
1353120	1359040	movie heroes can climb up trees really fast and mangoes and marmosets can hang upside down
1359040	1364800	that's crazy one or two prompts iterating on a design already agreed upon this is honestly
1364800	1369680	what is likely to happen in the future with people spending hours to find the perfect data
1369680	1376000	visualization or piece of data analysis and then just hitting copy paste for all their other files
1376000	1381280	perfect it once and then it does the rest for you a quick couple of bonus ones before I finish
1381280	1387280	you can just ask it to come up with a visualization giving it no direction at all it came up with a
1387280	1392560	distribution of prime numbers up to ten thousand thing is I believe there's a slight mistake at
1392560	1398080	the beginning because I think there's only 25 in the first 100 and 21 in the next 100 so you
1398080	1403040	probably do want to still check the outputs that code interpreter gives you and that's another reason
1403120	1408320	it's not going to instantly replace all data analysis and data visualization it's not perfect
1408320	1413040	and it's not fully reliable but you've got to look ahead to where things are going I'm going to end
1413040	1422400	where I started with this insane 3d surface map of a volcano if this is what gpc4 can do now with
1422400	1432080	the alpha version of code interpreter what will gpc5 or 6 do with version 7 or 20 of code interpreter
1432080	1437200	I was about to speculate about that but then I got distracted with trying to get inside this
1437200	1444320	volcano it is kind of fun and look I'm going above and into the volcano let me know what you
1444320	1448720	will try when you get access I know they're rolling it out steadily and I know that some people have
1448720	1453760	had access to it for about three weeks so hopefully if you want to experiment with it you will be able
1453760	1458720	too soon in the meantime do let me know if you have any ideas that you want me to experiment with
1458720	1464960	and thank you so much for watching all the way to the end have a wonderful day
