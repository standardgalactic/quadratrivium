0	2400	Everything has an equal and opposite.
2400	4000	It has to mate.
4000	5000	Whoa.
5000	7000	I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community.
7000	12000	You're kind of adding legitimacy to young hinged science fiction.
12000	14000	I wouldn't have been able to appear with Terrence
14000	16000	if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.
16000	23000	The platform to be accepted for the ideas is not social media.
23000	29000	Neil himself doesn't appear conversant in the history of science and reviewing.
29000	32000	It's ten times easier to produce something that's BS,
32000	34000	and so then it is to refute it.
34000	35000	Science has a branding problem.
35000	38000	If you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science,
38000	40000	you have all already lost.
40000	43000	Science has become a pagan faith.
43000	48000	Effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing
48000	53000	as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.
53000	57000	Trust the science became a mantra during the COVID pandemic,
57000	59000	but in the years since, and partly as a consequence,
59000	62000	a rising tide of people are doing quite the opposite.
62000	65000	Challenging the scientific mainstream is in vogue.
65000	69000	Nobody's this better illustrated than the recent viral phenomenon
69000	72000	of actor Terrence Howard on the Joe Rogan podcast,
72000	75000	the biggest media platform in the world right now,
75000	79000	arguing that one times one actually equals two,
79000	82000	among other bizarre theories.
82000	86000	They don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon.
86000	88000	What do you mean by tone?
88000	90000	Same tone, same QV.
90000	92000	You keep dividing light by two,
92000	96000	and you'll ultimately get back to the audible sound of it,
96000	99000	because there was a relationship between light and color,
99000	101000	sound and tone, matter and shape.
101000	105000	At a given point, Mars was here in the Goldilocks zone.
105000	107000	Everything has an equal and opposite.
107000	109000	It has to mate.
109000	112000	Mating is a big part of what we do.
112000	116000	The boron mates with nitrogen,
116000	118000	and that's how the carbon happens.
118000	122000	96% of physics is unknown matter,
122000	125000	that they've had to make up to account for it,
125000	127000	and we were able to build Saturn.
127000	129000	Man, don't turn my phone off, don't do that.
129000	131000	Every time I get ready,
131000	133000	well, because I know they're watching me right now,
133000	135000	and they're mad at me.
135000	137000	Whose day?
137000	141000	The politicians and the authorities
141000	144000	that give their politicians their accreditation.
144000	147000	And our world economy is based off of one times one equaling.
147000	149000	Do you think they fuck with your phone?
149000	151000	Oh, I'm sure of it.
154000	156000	Well, there were four hours of that,
156000	158000	but it's reached tens of millions of people.
158000	161000	It's been a true viral phenomenon, like I said.
161000	164000	Well, many in the scientific establishment expressed alarm
164000	167000	at the apparently limitless reach of wild theories
167000	169000	at a time science has a reputation problem.
169000	171000	Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson,
171000	173000	the most famous scientist on the planet,
173000	175000	had this to say.
200000	202000	It is not my podcast.
202000	208000	It is research journals where attention can be given
208000	212000	on a level that at the end of the day
212000	217000	offers no higher respect for your energy and intellect
217000	221000	than by declaring that what's in it is either right or wrong
221000	224000	or worthy of publication or not.
224000	226000	Well, others disagree.
226000	228000	They argue the old system needs to be shaken up.
228000	231000	The questioning and challenging mainstream institutions
231000	236000	and theories is the only real way to actually get to the truth.
236000	238000	Here to debate this, the podcast and cosmologist
238000	241000	at University of California, Professor Brian Keating,
241000	243000	host of Impact Theory, Tom Billier,
243000	245000	but I'll start with Dr. Eric Weinstein,
245000	248000	mathematician and OG of the Intellectual Dark Web
248000	251000	and creator of the Portal podcast.
251000	253000	Well, Eric, welcome back to Uncensored.
253000	257000	Really fascinating to see how big this has all blown
257000	259000	in the last few days.
259000	263000	For those who didn't watch the Terrence Howard four-hour,
263000	265000	I don't know what you would call it,
265000	268000	theory-a-thon, let's be kind.
268000	272000	What were the sort of main premises he was coming out with
272000	275000	that have captured everyone's attention?
275000	278000	Well, I think that the...
278000	281000	he made several outrageous claims
281000	285000	that were more or less baseless
285000	289000	as far as either the heterodox
289000	291000	or the orthodox view of science,
291000	294000	that one times one is equal to two,
294000	298000	that the periodic table should be rearranged
298000	305000	around earlier work from the 1920s,
305000	307000	that he had a theory of physics
307000	311000	based on platonic solids with curved linear sides.
311000	317000	I don't think any of those hold up to any kind of scrutiny.
317000	323000	That said, he definitely has some very interesting engineering claims
323000	327000	and he's got some very interesting geometric structures
327000	331000	that could make beautiful lighting, fantastic art,
331000	337000	and he is saying some things that people are deriding
337000	340000	from a scholarly perspective
340000	342000	that actually have some merit.
342000	346000	It's a very bizarre and complicated situation,
346000	349000	but it is not complicated at the root.
349000	352000	There's nothing wrong with standard orthodox science
352000	357000	and I say that as a very strong critic of the system.
357000	362000	If you wanted to hear it from somebody with a PhD
362000	365000	who's nevertheless not shy about savaging the institutions
365000	367000	when that is what they deserve,
367000	371000	I would say that the level of doubt that he has cast
371000	376000	on simple things like arithmetic is completely unwarranted,
376000	380000	but it's a very bizarre situation to watch an entire nation
380000	384000	that depends on technology and science for its advantage
384000	389000	suddenly question whether or not one times one equals one.
389000	392000	What is fascinating to me is the last time
392000	394000	I had him to do a Terence Howard,
394000	396000	I interviewed him at CNN about 10 years ago
396000	399000	when he did a movie about the Tuskegee Airmen,
399000	405000	and the next thing, he's doing a four-hour podcast with Joe Rogan
405000	409000	in which he's airing the most sort of intensely complex theories,
409000	412000	many of which, as you say, might be completely for the birds.
412000	416000	Were you aware that Terence Howard was thinking this way,
416000	421000	was moving to a place where he could even conduct an interview like that?
421000	427000	Well, to be honest, I didn't know who Terence Howard was,
427000	430000	so I didn't have an image for him,
430000	435000	but had you asked me, I would have thought back to Werner Herzog
435000	440000	doing the entire film Fitz Corraldo to test his engineering theories
440000	444000	about how less technologically advanced people could move heavy objects
444000	448000	many miles up hills.
448000	451000	He created an entire film to test his engineering theories.
451000	457000	Hedy Lamar famously developed spread-spectrum technology,
457000	461000	despite being a screen siren back in the 30s and 40s,
461000	464000	so just as I don't think it's very strange to find out
464000	467000	that Steve Martin is an incredible banjo player,
467000	473000	I don't find it at all odd that a polymath like Terence Howard
473000	475000	would have such theories.
475000	479000	I don't think that the theories about math and physics and chemistry
479000	483000	are incredibly deep, so I'm going to push back on that.
483000	488000	But I do think that he knows quite a lot about many things
488000	490000	and he doesn't know what he doesn't know.
490000	495000	Neil DeCrasse Tyson said that people can know enough
495000	499000	to ask questions and stuff, but maybe not enough to know when they're wrong.
499000	503000	In other words, when they're presented with quite complex science
503000	509000	that has been peer-reviewed and is deemed to be established scientific fact,
509000	516000	that he doesn't know enough about the detail to understand why he's wrong to question it.
516000	520000	You mean the Dunning-Kruger effect, as Neil said.
520000	525000	It's kind of ironic, actually, because it feels to me like Neil DeCrasse Tyson
525000	530000	is himself a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect when it comes to peer-review
530000	538000	as his comments about Sir Arthur Eddington using the 1919 total solar eclipse
538000	546000	to prove that Einstein's theory about a star warping space,
546000	551000	in particular our sun, appeared to be born out.
551000	554000	Neil claims that that was sent to a peer-reviewed journal,
554000	558000	whereas peer-review doesn't really begin in physics.
558000	563000	And in the sciences, really, until the 60s and much more the 70s.
563000	568000	So it's very interesting because Neil himself doesn't appear
568000	572000	conversant in the history of science and reviewing.
572000	576000	Isn't the reality of all science a bit like with medicine,
576000	582000	that a lot of very smart people take a look at a lot of available data
582000	586000	but maybe not enough to reach absolute definitive conclusions,
586000	590000	and they espouse theories which their peer group then look at
590000	593000	and discuss and analyze and argue about.
593000	599000	And that's how we progress with science over decades, centuries and so on.
599000	602000	Isn't this part of the evolution of science,
602000	607000	is that people like you and Neil DeCrasse Tyson might vehemently disagree about stuff,
607000	613000	but actually it's only through the disagreements you develop.
613000	617000	Well, but I doubt that he would agree to a program
617000	620000	where we were going to have a discussion about this.
620000	624000	My guess is that you reached out to him and that he was too busy to appear.
624000	631000	My claim is that in general we avoid dust-ups for fear of looking foolish.
631000	636000	And I think it's fine to avoid dust-ups when you feel that there's an ethical problem
636000	638000	with the other person.
638000	643000	In general, science progresses by a large variety of different channels.
643000	649000	Benjamin Jesty famously observed that his milkmaids weren't dying from smallpox,
649000	651000	but they did get cowpox.
651000	658000	So he injected his entire family with cow pus to give them cowpox to prevent against smallpox.
658000	661000	It's one of the beginnings of vaccines.
661000	665000	People would dig up bodies from graveyards to do anatomical studies.
665000	671000	Famously, the ulcer, which was thought to be correlated with stress,
671000	677000	was tested by the dissenting heterodox biomedical researcher
677000	682000	and shown to have a completely different etiology by using himself as a guinea pig.
682000	689000	I think that you have to understand that just as Benjamin Franklin took a kite and key
689000	693000	into an electrical storm to prove that lightning was electricity,
693000	697000	people have done all sorts of things that have nothing to do with learned societies
697000	706000	and the genteel sort of feel afforded by peer review in order to advance science.
706000	709000	I really think that in part what we've done is we've sanitized our own history
709000	711000	and we've forgotten what works.
711000	716000	What was interesting to me was Neil deGrasse Tyson didn't go on Joe Rogan to respond,
716000	719000	which is what Terrence Howard wanted him to do.
719000	723000	But you did, and here's a clip from that.
723000	726000	This is the other side of it.
726000	730000	This is what was very interesting.
730000	733000	Like these, they'll come together and meet.
733000	735000	You can see where they meet up.
735000	737000	They're natural meeting up.
737000	743000	Now this one looks exactly like this one, but they don't have the same mixture.
743000	748000	So what this is creating, this is actually showing, this is the equal and opposite.
748000	751000	This is matter, this becomes the anti-matter of it.
751000	752000	I can't stop you doing that.
752000	753000	You can't stop me.
753000	754000	I'm so sorry.
754000	757000	I'm my own worst enemy and my own best friend.
757000	758000	You know what?
758000	760000	That was a beautiful statement.
760000	765000	But what I'm trying to say is the fact that they keep, and these four will keep,
765000	768000	this is just the magnetic, what I consider the magnetic field.
768000	769000	You see, you stopped yourself.
769000	775000	I consider this to be the magnetic field because they're expanding at the center
775000	781000	and magnetism in my language, magnetism expands out and becomes greater.
781000	783000	And you know what you just said, in my language?
783000	784000	In my language.
784000	785000	That's what I just did with the Terrence product.
785000	789000	In other words, I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community off.
789000	790000	I don't want to piss them off.
790000	791000	I want friends.
791000	793000	I need friends.
793000	797000	Now the interesting thing to me is, as we would say in the UK, it sounded to me like
797000	800000	he was talking a load of old cobblers.
801000	808000	And yet you were there and you were being very generous and sort of reasonable and
808000	812000	decent with him and allowing him to continue with his theories.
812000	819000	That's attracted for you a lot of criticism that by engaging in that manner with him,
819000	825000	you're kind of adding legitimacy to slightly unhinged science fiction rather than promoting
825000	826000	the cause of science.
826000	829000	How do you respond to that?
829000	835000	First of all, this is always a scuttlebutt and people say, so I'm not very impressed
835000	836000	with that.
836000	842000	I would say that you have, I wouldn't say it's mildly unhinged.
842000	844000	I would say it's wildly unhinged.
844000	847000	A lot of this stuff is just nonsense.
847000	853000	On the other hand, I was very quick to spot something that I wouldn't have been able to
853000	857000	appear with Terrence if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.
857000	863000	And because I have a lot of background and experience in this area, it was possible for
863000	869000	me to go through what he said at a speed that I think very few people would be able to go
869000	870000	through his work.
870000	877000	Well, what percentage of what he was saying was true or at least vaguely sensible and
877000	878000	what was completely...
878000	879000	Very little.
879000	885000	Right, so my question, if it was genuinely very little, him getting tens of millions of
885000	890000	views for espousing complete nonsense in the main.
890000	895000	And then someone with your pedigree and your knowledge of this subject matter going on and
895000	903000	kind of going along with engaging him as a serious person in these things, is that not
903000	907000	in his own way diminishing science when you do that?
907000	912000	First of all, I wouldn't have had Terrence on the first time because it didn't do him
912000	917000	to what he actually is doing that's interesting to give him this amount of air.
917000	920000	That was a good friend of mine's choice.
920000	927000	So partially what you're seeing is a relationship between a comedian, Joe Rogan, and a mathematician,
927000	929000	Eric Weinstein.
929000	934000	Joe's a buddy of mine and he matters to me.
934000	937000	And he's the one who asked me to come on.
938000	942000	Some people tried to frame it as if I wanted to go on.
942000	945000	I had no interest in going on.
945000	953000	But if we were going to watch a mass delusion take shape, certainly I don't want any more
953000	954000	mass delusions.
954000	962000	And I also don't want the idea that once these ideas are out there that science is afraid
963000	968000	somehow to confront Terrence Howard's new theory of arithmetic.
968000	970000	He doesn't have a new theory of arithmetic.
970000	976000	And somebody needs to be the adult and say, this is not right.
976000	984000	On the other hand, you have to appreciate that all it takes is one great idea to move the
984000	987000	world and a lot of BS is going to be forgiven.
987000	995000	And if he has a great idea, I would suggest to you it's likely his concept of a six rotor
995000	1003000	drone that he calls the Lynch pin that's based on a mathematical error where he's fit six
1003000	1010000	pentagons through the edges of a regular tetrahedron giving him six degrees of freedom which
1010000	1016000	span what we would call the Lie algebra of the affine group giving him the ability to
1016000	1021000	rotate around a center and move to any point in three dimensional space.
1021000	1023000	It's an incredibly cool idea.
1023000	1024000	Now I don't know that it's his.
1024000	1026000	I believe that it's his, but I don't know that.
1026000	1027000	I haven't done that work.
1027000	1032000	I'm not a drone operator, so I don't realize what the state of the art is.
1032000	1036000	But imagine that that was the only thing that he did and that he figured out that these
1036000	1042000	things could fit together as per the Intel drone shows to form capsids in the shape of
1042000	1050000	dodecahedrons, much the way we see viruses doing that with capsimers and protein coats to
1050000	1053000	protect the genetic material.
1053000	1057000	That would be an incredible contribution of Terrence Howard.
1058000	1068000	And the thing that really disgusts me is watching my colleagues make fun of Terrence as easily
1068000	1070000	where he is right as where he is wrong.
1070000	1071000	It doesn't require that.
1071000	1074000	He's clearly a self-taught guy.
1074000	1080000	He pronounces words like canonically, canonically, which indicates that he's teaching himself.
1080000	1085000	And for all of this talk of the Neil deGrasse Tyson's where they say, I'm so pleased to see
1085000	1090000	active minds engaging with the world of ideas, they're really not.
1090000	1100000	And my feeling about this is pretending that Terrence Howard is a fool or an idiot is repugnant to me.
1100000	1106000	I mean, if you just take what he said about tones and the periodic table, because of some good
1106000	1111000	fortune in my life, I was able to go out to none other than one of the greatest musicians
1111000	1113000	now living, Stanley Jordan.
1113000	1123000	And say, Stanley, let's share your work on playing the periodic table by using the ionization energies
1123000	1127000	as frequency information, much the way Terrence was discussing.
1127000	1131000	So my feeling is, is that a lot of my colleagues just don't have enough knowledge.
1131000	1136000	And even though they're supposedly the academics sitting in professorial seats, they're not behaving
1136000	1137000	like professors.
1137000	1140000	They're not behaving like academicians.
1140000	1145000	They're making fun of somebody because it allows them to work out their own personal insecurities.
1145000	1147000	And that's not going to happen on my watch.
1147000	1152000	It's actually really fascinating because unless I'm mistaken, what you're saying is, look,
1152000	1155000	you might be wrong about 99% of his stuff.
1155000	1161000	But the 1% might be really significant, which is staggering to me that Terrence Howard has gone
1161000	1169000	through life as a movie actor is suddenly doing stuff which is to you quite groundbreaking
1169000	1173000	in the very complex world of science and mathematics and so on.
1173000	1176000	It's not in science and it's not in mathematics.
1176000	1185000	If he's doing something that I recognize, it's in engineering, art, and it's possible that he's doing something.
1185000	1192000	I was able to recognize where his shapes come from, where Neil does not appear to understand, which is fine.
1193000	1201000	So there's some very beautiful geometry, but it doesn't appear to me to be at a research level.
1201000	1209000	And I don't want to conflate, again, I'm hardly a pushover.
1209000	1213000	I'm saying he's wrong in chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
1213000	1219000	In fact, it doesn't rise to the level of a theory that needs to be actively considered.
1219000	1229000	That said, to dismiss everything he's saying because we can find, you know, sometimes a fly lands in your dish
1229000	1233000	and you insist that it be taken back at a restaurant.
1233000	1239000	Other times you just say, you know, five second rule, you're hungry, and it's not the fault of the restaurant.
1239000	1241000	And you just let it go.
1241000	1248000	And my feeling about this is what Neil did is really troubling.
1248000	1256000	What he did is that he advertised a fake openness, which is just submit what your work is to a peer review journal.
1256000	1264000	Neil either doesn't know the history of peer review, doesn't know why it's called peer review, has no concept of what peer review actually is,
1264000	1276000	which is bizarre, or he does know, and he's deliberately going to waste Terrence Howard's time because Terrence isn't a peer.
1276000	1283000	And the whole concept of peer review, the word peer isn't like a jury of your peers, your fellow citizens.
1283000	1287000	It's like peers in terms of the House of Lords.
1287000	1298000	The whole idea of peer review is to keep the lady, the people who don't do science for a living or medicine for a living, out of the review process.
1298000	1300000	And that's where it was born.
1300000	1305000	That's why it grew up in the 60s and 70s as peer review.
1305000	1315000	It was as part of a struggle where scientists wanted to wall off their kingdom and say, look, we are taking public money, but we don't want public review.
1315000	1317000	You're not qualified to be here.
1317000	1320000	Shut up, get out of our lab and let us work.
1320000	1331000	And that's why it's so fiercely defended is because it's the last ditch effort to keep the laity from interfering in matters that they can't understand.
1331000	1341000	The science itself has been under probably a bigger public assault in terms of its validity as a result of the COVID pandemic.
1341000	1351000	And I can never remember in my lifetime, certainly, is it damaging when everybody on social media suddenly becomes an epidemiologist,
1351000	1357000	wherever it may be, you know, any different type of science you like, or medical expert, whatever.
1357000	1365000	When their views get amplified, like Terrence Howard, if they're completely wrong, they get amplified and shared gazillions of times.
1365000	1368000	This has happened here with all of the things that he said.
1368000	1371000	Is it damaging to the integrity of science when that happens?
1371000	1379000	And is that a unique problem with social media, amplifying amateur scientific and medical views?
1379000	1381000	It's a very interesting question.
1381000	1384000	I would think that we would begin somewhere else.
1384000	1393000	The greatest damage is when we amplify pseudoscientists who happen to be official pseudoscientists.
1393000	1409000	So when you take a director of NAI, National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, and you take that person's contradictory pronouncements
1409000	1414000	and you amplify those, then suddenly everybody has to learn what mRNA is.
1414000	1421000	Because they're trying to make a decision for their child and suddenly you've thrust them into advanced biology
1421000	1430000	because you've amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institute of Health or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DITRA.
1430000	1436000	The failure and the pseudoscience is coming from inside the house.
1436000	1444000	The problem is when a Francis Collins and an Anthony Fauci in private emails can turn their dissenting colleagues,
1444000	1452000	fully competent expert dissident colleagues like Jay Bhattacharya and his colleagues at Harvard and Oxford,
1452000	1456000	and overnight they become fringe epidemiologists, right?
1456000	1460000	So more or less what you're seeing is not a failure of science.
1460000	1465000	What you're seeing is a failure of science to disavow public health.
1465000	1478000	Public health is not science. Public health is an incredibly bizarre field that tries to straddle two worlds of actual truth and the noble lie.
1478000	1488000	And as I've said before, the problem is the failure to cancel an ex-spouse's credit card privileges.
1488000	1496000	When the person takes the credit card on a spree, science did not cancel its credit card that it had given to public health.
1496000	1503000	And so what we had was an incredible destruction of trust in science, which is completely unwarranted
1503000	1508000	because people who are not acting as scientists, who may have at one time been scientists,
1508000	1514000	but have gone over to public policy, were allowed to lie on science's behalf.
1514000	1522000	That's a failure. I understand why the credit rating got beaten up, but for God's sakes, just cut off the credit card
1522000	1527000	and learn where scientists lie and where they do not. They don't lie generically.
1527000	1533000	There's nothing wrong with Hook's law. There's nothing wrong with the adapter hypothesis in biology.
1533000	1541000	There's nothing wrong with most of what we consider to be science. We lie in very special places out of necessity.
1541000	1546000	Let me bring in the other two guests now to debate actually what you've been saying.
1546000	1553000	Professor Brian Keating, cosmologist from San Diego University and Tom Billio, who's the Impact Theory podcast.
1553000	1559000	Professor Keating, your response to what you've just been hearing from Eric?
1559000	1566000	Well, I think scientists, we have a responsibility. Eric's known for calling the term the intellectual dark web.
1566000	1574000	And I feel like a scientist, we have a responsibility to keep the environmental, intellectual environment clear of pollution.
1574000	1582000	And I feel like there is a tendency because of this anti-authoritarian moment that we seem to be in to view science as authoritarian.
1582000	1591000	And then to rebel against it, we look to heroes and people like Terrence or Candace Owens or people like Tucker Carlson.
1591000	1595000	And they get enormous platforms because of their social media stature.
1595000	1606000	But to me, to listen to people who have no domain expertise and no proven track record is an affront to actual practicing scientists.
1606000	1611000	And it's fine to have a hobby. It's fine to do things out of an avocation of love for it.
1611000	1615000	But it's a bit, to me, an example of the halo effect, which is a cognitive bias.
1615000	1624000	And you have people you're listening to. In some cases, it's akin to listening to your friend, Piers, and your Tate for marital advice.
1624000	1634000	He may be a great MMA star and Terrence may be a great actor, but that gives them no and confers no benefit to their scientific practices.
1634000	1642000	And it would be like me going on to the set of Iron Man and trying to be like Terrence. You would laugh me off the stage and rightfully so.
1642000	1647000	So we have to look at an exam and these claims that amateurs can do good science.
1647000	1652000	Eric pointed out in the interview that there's some babies in with the bathwater.
1652000	1657000	And I'd love to ask my dear friend, Eric, to expound upon those particular babies.
1657000	1665000	Because to me, to say that there might be some angle or something like that or some drone, it sounds to me a little bit like damning with faint praise as well.
1665000	1673000	Because if you go through and there's 97 patents that he claims he has, we go through them, we find out that very few of them have been granted.
1673000	1676000	There may be a couple that have been granted.
1676000	1681000	You go through one times one equals two. Eric demonstrated clearly that's not the case.
1681000	1685000	You go through the periodic table. His ideas are completely wrong there.
1685000	1693000	His claims about gravity and building planets, that he's built the planet Saturn or comes out of a biological digestive process of the sun.
1693000	1697000	These things are completely fallacious.
1697000	1701000	So I think there's a danger and it's a symptom of the halo effect.
1701000	1706000	I mean, just in point about Andrew Tate, he's not a friend of mine. He's someone I've interviewed three times.
1706000	1716000	But the point I make about him at this debate with someone the other day is he has a huge following on social media, regardless of whether people like me interview him.
1716000	1720000	At least when I interview him, I get a chance to challenge him.
1720000	1727000	And I've really noticed when young men in particular come up to me in the street, which they do with alarming regularity about Andrew Tate,
1727000	1734000	that actually the conversation I have with him has moved from, God, you know, Andrew Tate is amazing.
1734000	1738000	I really liked it when you challenged him about this, this and this.
1738000	1744000	In other words, shining a light on people like Andrew Tate actually challenging them on a big platform.
1744000	1751000	I see tangible impact on the street of those challenges kicking through into people's consciousness.
1751000	1758000	You know, where they wouldn't if he was just able to do his thing slightly below radar on social media without ever being challenged.
1758000	1766000	So that's my kind of theory about why I interview people like him, which is in itself open to debate, obviously.
1766000	1773000	Eric, just in that response to the baby and bathwater, what would you say to Brian Keating's point there?
1773000	1782000	Well, I tried to say it already that if you take the vertices of a tetrahedron as measured from the center,
1782000	1789000	you're looking at an angle of the arc cosine of minus one-third, which is about 109.47 in degrees.
1789000	1793000	And if you take the interior angles of a regular pentagon, it's 108.
1793000	1800000	So 108 is not 109.47, but it is close enough so that within engineering tolerances,
1800000	1808000	you can put six of these motors into a regular tetrahedron and then you can potentially, therefore,
1808000	1815000	traverse all of the dimensions needed to orient the object around its center of mass and to move it to any point three-dimensional space.
1815000	1820000	I've stated that clearly to any technical person who wants to hear it.
1820000	1827000	It may be that there's prior art and it may be that it doesn't end up being that interesting because of the tolerances or it's too difficult to work.
1827000	1831000	That's fine, but I've already stated what the baby is.
1831000	1838000	And further, Brian, I was very surprised that you just corrected me on social media.
1838000	1845000	Now, of course, we're friends and so I don't mind having this back and forth, but you've stated that in my field,
1845000	1853000	that peer review is much older than Gillain Maxwell, who was born in 1961.
1853000	1861000	And you cited a bunch of journals in physics and, in fact, that's simply not true.
1861000	1874000	Well, I have Melinda Baldwin's article here, which says, however, most papers accepted for physical review never went out to referees at all.
1874000	1881000	The editor accepted most papers on its own authority, consulting referees only when he thought he might want to reject a paper.
1881000	1888000	It was not until the 1960s that all physical review papers were sent out for external referee opinion.
1888000	1901000	More or less, peer review comes out of Utah in 1972 through Senator Wallace Bennett's amendment that forces the issue into the NIH framework
1901000	1910000	because the Medicare Act was established in 1965 making the U.S. taxpayer responsible for medical payments
1910000	1916000	that they suddenly wanted access to knowing why are we paying all of this money to doctors without the ability to question them.
1916000	1925000	So, in part, what I'm astounded by is that we're not even aware of our own history.
1925000	1936000	If George Green, the Miller, with no formal education mailed off a solution to an inversion problem for differential operators,
1936000	1944000	which is what gives us Green's functions, which Feynman made famous, he didn't have any training whatsoever.
1944000	1952000	It's in part very dangerous to be offended when people listen to what we say.
1952000	1959000	And they then say, I keep hearing that science is for everyone and that mathematics is a great place to play.
1959000	1962000	There are no bad questions.
1962000	1968000	And then when they appear to take an interest, we cut their heads off.
1968000	1973000	And my feeling is that I'm not going to do that.
1973000	1974000	I'm going to state what this is.
1974000	1976000	This is an elite activity.
1976000	1978000	It's elite the way a violinist is elite.
1978000	1982000	It's elite the way a surgeon is an elite brain surgeon.
1982000	1989000	You're not going to have somebody say, hey, I've been doing brain surgery in my backyard on my family members and I'm ready for prime time.
1989000	1994000	We are not honest about the extent that this is an elite community.
1994000	2009000	And the last thing that I would add to what you said is part of the problem is where are the dissident scientists who don't go along inside of the university system, inside of the research institutions?
2009000	2020000	If you had them, they would have been tarred and feathered during DEI because they would have said, who are these foreign intruders into the academic arena?
2020000	2022000	We must fire them and get them out.
2022000	2025000	Claudine Gay could never have become president of Harvard.
2025000	2030000	What we've done is we've gotten rid of all of the dissenting experts.
2030000	2040000	And the dissenting experts who are going to get up and at the top of their lungs say, hey, we've got a disaster in theoretical physics at the moment.
2040000	2053000	We have an abomination in the way in which we are pretending that random mutation is decidedly the main engine of Darwinian selection.
2053000	2059000	We're going to pretend that neoclassical economics is on solid ground.
2059000	2064000	All of these things are just absolutely silly.
2064000	2073000	And effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.
2073000	2085000	And I promise you that it's more expensive to get rid of your dissenters who actually know what they're talking about than it is to open it up to a public that wonders whether they've just shortened the life of their child
2085000	2089000	by giving them an unnecessary experimental pseudo-vaccine.
2089000	2091000	All right, let me bring in Tom if you're waiting very patiently.
2091000	2095000	Tom, what's your perspective on this?
2095000	2102000	So I think the key thing to understand is if you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science, you have already lost.
2102000	2109000	So the goal here has to be to understand that we are living in the age of conspiracy, and that is the problem.
2109000	2120000	When I saw the interview with Terrence Howard and Joe Rogan the first time, I just about dislocated my finger dialing Eric to call him up to be like, hey, you have to refute this stuff.
2120000	2134000	And the reason that I was very excited to see that he went on and did that and did that so well, Eric, you are a national treasure, is that it does not matter to me what the elites think in isolation.
2135000	2142000	All that happens is if people have an idea that hits a critical mass, they begin to bifurcate.
2142000	2148000	I mean, this is like the multiverse where we no longer have a shared vision of what is true.
2148000	2153000	That has second and third order consequences that I think are going to be terrifying for the nation.
2154000	2169000	And when you have a thinker like Eric, who can actually go through and say, hey, let me steal, man, what I have heard you say, which Joe and Terrence would not let him do, which I was mortified by, because he should have just laid it out.
2169000	2172000	Here are the base assumptions, and then we're going to build up from that.
2172000	2182000	Now, the reason that I want that to happen is when an idea, whether it is terrible, whether it is obviously terrible, whether every elite person in the world who does science is like, this is the worst idea ever.
2183000	2190000	You have to understand because of a whole host of things, but certainly COVID being a nice mile marker for us.
2190000	2195000	It broke people's trust in elites to lead us properly.
2195000	2197000	It broke our trust in science.
2197000	2202000	And so now you must, in fact, I will say, scientists, I love you all.
2202000	2204000	You have no obligation to do what I'm saying.
2204000	2216000	I beseech you as somebody who wants society to move forward well, that if an idea hits a certain level of critical mass in the public's awareness, even if you hate it, you are going to have to address it.
2216000	2228000	If you want to lead us well forward, but you have to do it based on base assumptions so that anybody following along at home that's trying to build their thinking up can go, oh, I actually understand Terrence's base assumptions.
2229000	2231000	One times one equals two.
2231000	2233000	All things are in motion.
2233000	2237000	There's no straight lines like things that, OK, have I understood your position perfectly Terrence?
2237000	2239000	Yes, Eric, you have.
2239000	2240000	OK, amazing.
2240000	2248000	Now I'm going to walk through each of those base assumptions and show you which ones are broken and how that is going to make the rest of your sequencing fall apart.
2248000	2256000	If people would just stay focused on utility, these beliefs work in the real world, we would be in a much better position.
2256000	2257000	That's what I want to see more of.
2257000	2258000	OK, let me bring Brian in.
2258000	2261000	Before I come to you, Brian, though, I want to play a clip from Candice Owens.
2261000	2267000	This was several days after the debate that Rogan and Terrence had.
2267000	2270000	Why I am now rejecting the cult of science.
2270000	2276000	So many things that they've lied to us about vaccines, birth control, people that are being injured and that we just accept everything.
2276000	2281000	What I said was that science has become a pagan faith.
2281000	2284000	Yes, that's what I actually believe.
2284000	2288000	Do you want to say that NASA has satanic origins and so on?
2288000	2297000	Now, I interviewed Candice myself recently and she's a bona fide anti-vaccine, doesn't believe in vaccines at all.
2297000	2299000	And she has a big following.
2299000	2309000	And there are lots of people like her out there now saying that because there have been legitimate areas of concern around the COVID vaccines,
2309000	2313000	that everything about them is flawed and wrong.
2313000	2318000	And therefore all the scientists who promoted them are the devil.
2318000	2321000	And this stuff gathers momentum.
2321000	2323000	I see it spreading like wildfire.
2323000	2329000	She also says that Emmanuel Macron's wife is a man by having had three kids and so on.
2329000	2331000	And these things gather their own momentum.
2331000	2333000	And whilst on one level it's sort of humorous,
2333000	2340000	on another level it's actually, I think, very damaging because it means that scientists can never be wrong again.
2340000	2345000	Because if they're wrong about any one aspect of a big thing like a COVID pandemic,
2345000	2349000	which is fast moving and evolving and changing, if they're wrong about any aspect of it,
2349000	2353000	the whole thing gets trashed by this community.
2353000	2358000	This is why we have to understand that this is about the age of conspiracy.
2358000	2362000	The very thing that Eric, I think, is trying to combat is to say,
2362000	2366000	science is about figuring out where we are wrong.
2366000	2371000	And if scientists stake their reputation as they have done over the last four or five years entirely on always being right,
2371000	2374000	then if I can pull one thread and it falls apart, everything is dead.
2374000	2381000	But if science just gets behind Feynman's statement that this is about distrusting experts and figuring out where they're wrong,
2381000	2386000	now it can become a far more fruitful pursuit of what actually works.
2386000	2389000	Okay, Brian, Brian, your thoughts on that?
2389000	2394000	Yeah, Tom, just because someone's an expert doesn't necessarily mean that you have to distrust them.
2394000	2397000	When you look at something, there's a concept called Brandolini's Law,
2397000	2401000	which my kids are nearby, so I'm not going to say in its full terms.
2401000	2405000	But it's basically that it's 10 times easier to produce something that's BS,
2405000	2407000	and so then it is to refute it.
2407000	2411000	Therefore, the world is full of unrefuted BS.
2411000	2417000	And to put that on scientists, to make us sort of the intellectual SEAL Team 6,
2417000	2419000	where we can never be wrong.
2419000	2421000	The terrorists only have to be right once.
2421000	2426000	And everyone else is relying on us, SEAL Team 6, that we're never wrong.
2426000	2430000	To put that in perspective, when you listen to people like this,
2430000	2436000	Candace tweeting from her laptop and enabled by technology that was invented at Bell Labs,
2436000	2441000	the byproduct of the space race, which she also denies, moon landings and so forth.
2441000	2443000	We're not in New Age.
2443000	2451000	We're in a pre-scientific age where people can unfortunately spread not scientific truth
2451000	2454000	via scientific proof, which Eric, I'm sorry to say.
2454000	2457000	My academic genealogy goes back 17 generations.
2457000	2460000	Every single one of those people, including my students,
2460000	2464000	now in my third generation, I have graduate students out of their own graduate students,
2464000	2465000	they've all been through peer review.
2465000	2469000	We didn't have Pergamum Press and Robert Maxwell, that is true.
2469000	2471000	Einstein published almost all of his famous papers.
2471000	2472000	They were done by peer review.
2472000	2478000	In fact, the discovery of gravitational waves, one of the most revolutionary discoveries in all of science.
2478000	2483000	That prediction, he first tried to get submitted in the early 1930s,
2483000	2486000	and he didn't want to get a peer review, and there was an error in it.
2486000	2487000	He said it would never be detected.
2487000	2488000	Imagine that.
2488000	2489000	Einstein made a mistake.
2489000	2493000	But thanks to peer review, that paper was published in 1936,
2493000	2496000	and it went on to win the Nobel Prize for some of my good friends.
2496000	2499000	I've interviewed 20 Nobel laureates on my podcast,
2499000	2504000	and three of them won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the thing that Einstein thought was impossible.
2504000	2508000	We can go back many, many generations, and yes, they didn't have presses.
2508000	2512000	Of course, the printing press was only a relatively recent invention,
2512000	2515000	but you go to the peer review process.
2515000	2518000	Not far from where peers is right now is the Royal Society,
2518000	2521000	and also not too far away is the Royal Institution.
2521000	2522000	I've been to both places.
2522000	2526000	I've lectured there, and when you go to those places, yes, there wasn't a press,
2526000	2529000	but you gather your peers around you, and you do an experiment,
2529000	2533000	and that experiment would either fail or pass in real time,
2533000	2535000	and you would get feedback from a jury.
2535000	2536000	Okay.
2536000	2537000	No jury of the peers.
2537000	2538000	Okay.
2538000	2542000	Eric, it seems like watching Elon Musk goes with him, actually, the other day.
2542000	2544000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2544000	2545000	I have to respond to that.
2545000	2546000	Okay, respond first.
2546000	2548000	Brian, what you just said is not true.
2548000	2551000	You know, it's just, the fact is, is that Einstein...
2551000	2555000	The Einstein paper was not published in 1936 after peer review there?
2555000	2561000	Sorry, that was John Tate, who was the editor at Physical Review before Simon Pasternak,
2561000	2564000	before Sam Goodschmidt.
2564000	2568000	Yes, it is true that most of Einstein's work was not peer reviewed.
2568000	2570000	That's why he was incensed.
2570000	2574000	He'd never sent another paper to Physical Review if I'm not incorrect.
2574000	2576000	Please check me on it.
2576000	2578000	Was that paper reviewed?
2578000	2583000	The fact is, there was one paper with Rosen that was peer reviewed,
2583000	2587000	which incensed Einstein because he was used to not being peer reviewed.
2587000	2589000	And he was wrong about it.
2589000	2593000	In other words, until peer review pointed out by Eddington, Eddington helped out as well
2593000	2596000	and said that there was another and it's calculation.
2596000	2599000	Peer review is not referee review, right?
2599000	2604000	We had external referees that were occasionally sought,
2604000	2609000	but what you cite about the Royal Society is, in fact,
2609000	2612000	an error introduced into the literature by Merton.
2612000	2620000	The famous historian of science who was the father of the Merton, of Black Scholes Merton fame.
2620000	2628000	And that was an erroneous claim that peer review began, I think, in the 1700s.
2628000	2632000	What we currently call peer review is far more recent
2632000	2642000	and it is fantastic to find out that our professor does not know the history of peer review in its own subjects
2642000	2650000	because what we have is we have a chorus of people with the highest credentials repeating a fable.
2650000	2657000	And we can't always tell when malware has entered our minds.
2657000	2663000	But I would submit to you, sir, that despite your pedigree, in general,
2663000	2672000	your predecessors were not peer reviewed in any modern sense of the term before the 1970s,
2672000	2675000	certainly before the 1960s.
2675000	2682000	The beginning of forms for external referees begins, I think, in the 1930s under John Tate.
2682000	2685000	I just don't think you know the history.
2685000	2690000	I don't know. And in fact, I invite you to go down to the Royal Institution next time you're in London
2690000	2695000	and you'll see pictures of Michael Faraday, of J.J. Thompson, of Eddington.
2695000	2700000	You'll see them in front of audiences. Was there a peer review process before journals?
2700000	2702000	When would they be journal nature?
2702000	2705000	The average person is perfect in themselves in the face right now.
2705000	2709000	As somebody that loves you two, literally, I know both these guys. Eric, I know very well.
2709000	2712000	Both have been on my show. Brian, I love you guys.
2712000	2714000	So I say this because I am begging you.
2714000	2720000	The average person wants to chew through their TV set right now or their laptop as they're listening to this.
2720000	2723000	And the reason is they don't care about this.
2723000	2725000	It's already done.
2725000	2726000	Sorry, sorry.
2726000	2727000	Hold on. Let me finish. Let me finish.
2727000	2731000	The world cares about people like they want to hear what Joe Rogan has to say.
2731000	2733000	They want to hear who goes on his show.
2733000	2736000	They are absolutely going to listen to Candice.
2736000	2739000	I think, Brian, you brought that up. Candice is about to sweep the world.
2739000	2746000	And if I could just get you guys on board with the reality that we are in a very difficult moment right now,
2746000	2749000	where, yes, you guys are being asked to do a public service,
2749000	2754000	which is to collide with these people who do not have your scientific bona fides,
2754000	2756000	but the average person does not care,
2756000	2760000	but they will actually listen to your collision of ideas for sure,
2760000	2763000	because I took a lot away from you talking to Terrence.
2763000	2767000	And the first time I heard Terrence, I was like, maybe this is genius. I don't know.
2767000	2771000	You know, it's so interesting. I was going to say, actually, Eric,
2771000	2774000	earlier that I saw Elon Musk recently, many of the first time,
2774000	2782000	and he did a fascinating Q&A about everything from colonising Mars to humanoid robots and so on.
2782000	2787000	But I also, we talked about X and his purchase of Twitter and then two X.
2787000	2793000	One of the best things I've seen in terms of populist peer review is community notes now on X,
2793000	2798000	where I often see things which are spinning around, which are complete nonsense,
2798000	2803000	and then you see a very well-sourced community note killing it.
2803000	2808000	And it does seem to have an effect, because that in itself, because it's happening in the same medium,
2808000	2812000	starts to also spread like wildfire and tends to kill them quite quickly.
2812000	2820000	Are you a fan of what Elon is doing with X? Is this helping it as a populist peer reviewing?
2820000	2828000	Yeah, again, this is one of these Wild West conversations where it's not peer review.
2828000	2836000	The whole concept of peer review is peer, and community notes is community, right?
2836000	2840000	And so in a certain sense, the point is it's an anti-peer review.
2840000	2842000	It's working pretty well right now.
2842000	2848000	But keep in mind that Wikipedia worked pretty well until people figured out how to game it.
2848000	2854000	So my concern is, is that what you're looking at with peer review and with community notes,
2854000	2864000	which is anti-peer review, if you will, is technologies that are in the process of being probed and gamed.
2864000	2869000	And just to refute what Tom was saying before, Tom, I don't disagree at all.
2869000	2871000	We are going to have to deal with the Candace phenomena.
2871000	2878000	But the reason the Candace phenomenon is happening is that you don't have any expert dissident opinion.
2878000	2885000	If you have five professors shout me down that I don't know what I'm talking about with respect to peer review,
2885000	2889000	and I happen to be completely right, I will be told that I'm not an academic,
2889000	2893000	despite the fact that we all speak the same language and have the same credentials.
2893000	2897000	What is going on is that the world is not crying out for Candace Owen.
2897000	2902000	It's crying out for where is the physician with my daughter's interests at heart?
2902000	2909000	Where is the biologist who's willing to stand up to a Tony Fauci and say, I completely disagree?
2909000	2914000	Why is it that we keep having these fake consensus?
2914000	2920000	And these consensus are basically determined by getting rid of the people who won't shut up
2920000	2924000	and who won't sit down and who won't sing from the hymnal.
2924000	2928000	And what I'm trying to say is what you just saw was an interchange between two colleagues
2928000	2936000	with a great deal of love and respect for each other on an issue where I'm claiming that the good professor is simply an error.
2936000	2942000	And if you had somebody saying that around the Wuhan lab and the origin of COVID
2942000	2949000	or the potential danger of the vaccines or the liability regime in which they were negotiated,
2949000	2953000	that this is an abomination, that we can't sue the manufacturers,
2953000	2957000	you would have a totally different world. Nobody would be listening to Candace Owen.
2957000	2959000	They would be trying to track Jay Bhattacharya.
2959000	2966000	They would be trying to track all of the experts who were standing up with their interests at heart.
2966000	2972000	The big problem in the United States is we used to have experts in the right chairs who dissented.
2972000	2976000	And now what you have is a group of people who know to keep their head down.
2976000	2980000	Brian, just want to end with just quick thoughts from you and Tom before we finish.
2980000	2983000	Give me some hope about the future of science.
2983000	2988000	Clearly, I think it's indisputable that science and the integrity of science and scientists
2988000	2991000	has never been under a bigger attack than it is today.
2991000	2994000	A lot of it fueled by conspiracy theorists and social media.
2994000	2999000	Give me some hope for the future of science and its integrity.
2999000	3003000	I think the hope comes from my students, the people that I work with,
3003000	3009000	the incredible breakthroughs that I've been witness to both personally and part of a team of 300 scientists
3009000	3014000	that are working to uncover what happened during the first nanosecond in the cosmos's history.
3014000	3019000	What kind of breakthroughs do we now unlock knowing that the universe is suffused with dark energy?
3019000	3024000	What do we learn about the future possibly with new technology like high temperature,
3024000	3027000	room temperature, superconductivity, or perhaps fusion?
3027000	3030000	That's never been a more exciting time to be a scientist.
3030000	3033000	And they hear about science as its best days are behind us.
3033000	3034000	I think that's nonsense.
3034000	3039000	On the other hand, we have to guard against conspiracy theories and flat earthers
3039000	3044000	and all sorts of anti-vaxxers and things like that because there is always a grain of truth.
3044000	3047000	As Isaac Asimov said, if you believe the earth is flat, you're wrong.
3047000	3051000	But if you believe it's perfectly round two, you're also wrong, but you're less wrong.
3051000	3057000	And I think what we want to do as scientists is not be held to this impossible secret service level
3057000	3059000	where we can't make a single mistake.
3059000	3062000	Recognize that we do make mistakes, but science is self-correcting.
3062000	3067000	And part of that self-correction mechanism has to do with being analyzed by your peers.
3067000	3073000	Whatever Eric and I disagree with about in the past, today's peer review is perhaps, as I like to say,
3073000	3078000	it's the worst system for gauging scientific process except for all the rest.
3078000	3080000	Tom?
3080000	3081000	All right.
3081000	3085000	So the thing that I really want to make sure that I'm being heard on, Brian,
3085000	3090000	is you keep repeating, we shouldn't be held to this team, CL team six level of perfection.
3090000	3093000	What I'm saying is silence, science has a branding problem.
3093000	3095000	You guys created a branding problem.
3095000	3101000	I'll just say during COVID where it was, hey, everybody listened to us and everything is going to be fine.
3101000	3106000	Masks don't work, by the way, but save them for the health workers because they need them.
3106000	3109000	It's like, so everyone's brain starts sketching out.
3109000	3111000	Also, no one has talked about social media yet.
3111000	3113000	Social media, this is done.
3113000	3115000	The horses are out of the stable.
3115000	3116000	The toothpaste is all over the floor.
3116000	3118000	The genie has flown out of the bottle.
3118000	3121000	We are living in a reality where everybody is a publisher.
3121000	3125000	Everybody is going to say things and people are screaming out for Candace Owens.
3125000	3130000	I'm telling you right now, as somebody, I'm almost sure I'm going to disagree with every word out of her mouth.
3130000	3138000	And yet I am utterly fascinated by how she has already captured people in terms of their imagination because this is what they want.
3138000	3141000	As a marketer, I can tell you, you guys are terrible.
3141000	3147000	Like if I have to market you, oh God, even though I look at Eric and I'm like, is this the smartest human I've ever encountered?
3147000	3148000	For sure.
3148000	3151000	Do I want him at my house just whispering in my ear all the things to do?
3151000	3152000	Absolutely.
3152000	3153000	My life will be way better.
3153000	3157000	However, from a marketing perspective, oh dear God.
3157000	3161000	So it's like we have a much bigger challenge that we have to overcome.
3161000	3163000	And Candace doesn't have that problem.
3163000	3164000	She's electrifying.
3164000	3166000	She captures what people want to hear.
3166000	3174000	And what I'm saying is the service that you guys can now play in the world that we live in is to say science isn't about being right.
3174000	3176000	Science is about two things.
3176000	3179000	Number one, the pursuit of utility.
3179000	3184000	Einstein's breakthroughs matter because they give us GPS and nuclear energy.
3184000	3186000	That's the only reason that they matter.
3186000	3191000	And the second thing is we know we're wrong about a whole lot of stuff.
3191000	3195000	And so our job is just go through what are all the things we're wrong about that are stopping us?
3195000	3197000	And I hope I'm not talking out of class, Eric.
3197000	3198000	Oh, please God.
3198000	3206000	But Eric has said to me many times, we ought to be traveling the cosmos and we aren't because string theory has gotten stuck.
3206000	3207000	Exactly.
3207000	3209000	So you have to get new ideas.
3209000	3214000	You have to break the old paradigms in order to get the utility that you want.
3214000	3219000	And if we judge every idea by its utility and not by where it comes from, we'll be in a much better place.
3219000	3233000	You know that the best thing about this debate, Tom, is that it's actually by having this kind of conversation on a platform like this that is watched globally in pretty big numbers now that we can probably get to where you want to get science to.
3233000	3240000	And the other thing I observe is I host a lot of debates between people who disagree and they normally end up screaming at each other.
3240000	3247000	What I loved about you three was the more abusive you became in a very nice polite manner, the more you all laughed.
3247000	3249000	And that is the way to debate.
3249000	3252000	So thank you all very much indeed.
3252000	3254000	Thank you, Pierce.
3254000	3255000	Thank you.
