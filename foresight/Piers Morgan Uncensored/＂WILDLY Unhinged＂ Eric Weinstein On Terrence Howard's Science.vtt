00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Everything has an equal and opposite.

00:02.400 --> 00:04.000
It has to mate.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Whoa.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
You're kind of adding legitimacy to young hinged science fiction.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I wouldn't have been able to appear with Terrence

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
The platform to be accepted for the ideas is not social media.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Neil himself doesn't appear conversant in the history of science and reviewing.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
It's ten times easier to produce something that's BS,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
and so then it is to refute it.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Science has a branding problem.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
If you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
you have all already lost.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Science has become a pagan faith.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Trust the science became a mantra during the COVID pandemic,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
but in the years since, and partly as a consequence,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
a rising tide of people are doing quite the opposite.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Challenging the scientific mainstream is in vogue.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Nobody's this better illustrated than the recent viral phenomenon

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
of actor Terrence Howard on the Joe Rogan podcast,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
the biggest media platform in the world right now,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
arguing that one times one actually equals two,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
among other bizarre theories.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
They don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What do you mean by tone?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Same tone, same QV.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You keep dividing light by two,

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
and you'll ultimately get back to the audible sound of it,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
because there was a relationship between light and color,

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
sound and tone, matter and shape.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
At a given point, Mars was here in the Goldilocks zone.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Everything has an equal and opposite.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
It has to mate.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Mating is a big part of what we do.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
The boron mates with nitrogen,

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
and that's how the carbon happens.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
96% of physics is unknown matter,

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
that they've had to make up to account for it,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and we were able to build Saturn.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Man, don't turn my phone off, don't do that.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Every time I get ready,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
well, because I know they're watching me right now,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
and they're mad at me.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Whose day?

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
The politicians and the authorities

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
that give their politicians their accreditation.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
And our world economy is based off of one times one equaling.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Do you think they fuck with your phone?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Oh, I'm sure of it.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, there were four hours of that,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
but it's reached tens of millions of people.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
It's been a true viral phenomenon, like I said.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, many in the scientific establishment expressed alarm

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
at the apparently limitless reach of wild theories

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
at a time science has a reputation problem.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
the most famous scientist on the planet,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
had this to say.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It is not my podcast.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
It is research journals where attention can be given

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
on a level that at the end of the day

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
offers no higher respect for your energy and intellect

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
than by declaring that what's in it is either right or wrong

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
or worthy of publication or not.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, others disagree.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
They argue the old system needs to be shaken up.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
The questioning and challenging mainstream institutions

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
and theories is the only real way to actually get to the truth.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Here to debate this, the podcast and cosmologist

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
at University of California, Professor Brian Keating,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
host of Impact Theory, Tom Billier,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
but I'll start with Dr. Eric Weinstein,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
mathematician and OG of the Intellectual Dark Web

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
and creator of the Portal podcast.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, Eric, welcome back to Uncensored.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Really fascinating to see how big this has all blown

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
in the last few days.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
For those who didn't watch the Terrence Howard four-hour,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't know what you would call it,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
theory-a-thon, let's be kind.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
What were the sort of main premises he was coming out with

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
that have captured everyone's attention?

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Well, I think that the...

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
he made several outrageous claims

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
that were more or less baseless

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
as far as either the heterodox

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
or the orthodox view of science,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
that one times one is equal to two,

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
that the periodic table should be rearranged

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
around earlier work from the 1920s,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
that he had a theory of physics

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
based on platonic solids with curved linear sides.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't think any of those hold up to any kind of scrutiny.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
That said, he definitely has some very interesting engineering claims

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
and he's got some very interesting geometric structures

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
that could make beautiful lighting, fantastic art,

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
and he is saying some things that people are deriding

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
from a scholarly perspective

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
that actually have some merit.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
It's a very bizarre and complicated situation,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
but it is not complicated at the root.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
There's nothing wrong with standard orthodox science

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
and I say that as a very strong critic of the system.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
If you wanted to hear it from somebody with a PhD

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
who's nevertheless not shy about savaging the institutions

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
when that is what they deserve,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I would say that the level of doubt that he has cast

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
on simple things like arithmetic is completely unwarranted,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
but it's a very bizarre situation to watch an entire nation

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
that depends on technology and science for its advantage

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
suddenly question whether or not one times one equals one.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
What is fascinating to me is the last time

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I had him to do a Terence Howard,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I interviewed him at CNN about 10 years ago

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
when he did a movie about the Tuskegee Airmen,

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
and the next thing, he's doing a four-hour podcast with Joe Rogan

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
in which he's airing the most sort of intensely complex theories,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
many of which, as you say, might be completely for the birds.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Were you aware that Terence Howard was thinking this way,

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
was moving to a place where he could even conduct an interview like that?

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, to be honest, I didn't know who Terence Howard was,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
so I didn't have an image for him,

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
but had you asked me, I would have thought back to Werner Herzog

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
doing the entire film Fitz Corraldo to test his engineering theories

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
about how less technologically advanced people could move heavy objects

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
many miles up hills.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
He created an entire film to test his engineering theories.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
Hedy Lamar famously developed spread-spectrum technology,

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
despite being a screen siren back in the 30s and 40s,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
so just as I don't think it's very strange to find out

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
that Steve Martin is an incredible banjo player,

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
I don't find it at all odd that a polymath like Terence Howard

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
would have such theories.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't think that the theories about math and physics and chemistry

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
are incredibly deep, so I'm going to push back on that.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
But I do think that he knows quite a lot about many things

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
and he doesn't know what he doesn't know.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Neil DeCrasse Tyson said that people can know enough

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
to ask questions and stuff, but maybe not enough to know when they're wrong.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
In other words, when they're presented with quite complex science

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
that has been peer-reviewed and is deemed to be established scientific fact,

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
that he doesn't know enough about the detail to understand why he's wrong to question it.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
You mean the Dunning-Kruger effect, as Neil said.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
It's kind of ironic, actually, because it feels to me like Neil DeCrasse Tyson

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
is himself a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect when it comes to peer-review

08:50.000 --> 08:58.000
as his comments about Sir Arthur Eddington using the 1919 total solar eclipse

08:58.000 --> 09:06.000
to prove that Einstein's theory about a star warping space,

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
in particular our sun, appeared to be born out.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Neil claims that that was sent to a peer-reviewed journal,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
whereas peer-review doesn't really begin in physics.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And in the sciences, really, until the 60s and much more the 70s.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
So it's very interesting because Neil himself doesn't appear

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
conversant in the history of science and reviewing.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Isn't the reality of all science a bit like with medicine,

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
that a lot of very smart people take a look at a lot of available data

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
but maybe not enough to reach absolute definitive conclusions,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
and they espouse theories which their peer group then look at

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
and discuss and analyze and argue about.

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
And that's how we progress with science over decades, centuries and so on.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Isn't this part of the evolution of science,

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
is that people like you and Neil DeCrasse Tyson might vehemently disagree about stuff,

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
but actually it's only through the disagreements you develop.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Well, but I doubt that he would agree to a program

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
where we were going to have a discussion about this.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
My guess is that you reached out to him and that he was too busy to appear.

10:24.000 --> 10:31.000
My claim is that in general we avoid dust-ups for fear of looking foolish.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
And I think it's fine to avoid dust-ups when you feel that there's an ethical problem

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
with the other person.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
In general, science progresses by a large variety of different channels.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
Benjamin Jesty famously observed that his milkmaids weren't dying from smallpox,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
but they did get cowpox.

10:51.000 --> 10:58.000
So he injected his entire family with cow pus to give them cowpox to prevent against smallpox.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
It's one of the beginnings of vaccines.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
People would dig up bodies from graveyards to do anatomical studies.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
Famously, the ulcer, which was thought to be correlated with stress,

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
was tested by the dissenting heterodox biomedical researcher

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
and shown to have a completely different etiology by using himself as a guinea pig.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
I think that you have to understand that just as Benjamin Franklin took a kite and key

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
into an electrical storm to prove that lightning was electricity,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
people have done all sorts of things that have nothing to do with learned societies

11:37.000 --> 11:46.000
and the genteel sort of feel afforded by peer review in order to advance science.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I really think that in part what we've done is we've sanitized our own history

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
and we've forgotten what works.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
What was interesting to me was Neil deGrasse Tyson didn't go on Joe Rogan to respond,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
which is what Terrence Howard wanted him to do.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
But you did, and here's a clip from that.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
This is the other side of it.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
This is what was very interesting.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Like these, they'll come together and meet.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
You can see where they meet up.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
They're natural meeting up.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
Now this one looks exactly like this one, but they don't have the same mixture.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
So what this is creating, this is actually showing, this is the equal and opposite.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
This is matter, this becomes the anti-matter of it.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I can't stop you doing that.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
You can't stop me.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
I'm so sorry.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm my own worst enemy and my own best friend.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You know what?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
That was a beautiful statement.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
But what I'm trying to say is the fact that they keep, and these four will keep,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
this is just the magnetic, what I consider the magnetic field.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
You see, you stopped yourself.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
I consider this to be the magnetic field because they're expanding at the center

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
and magnetism in my language, magnetism expands out and becomes greater.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And you know what you just said, in my language?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
In my language.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
That's what I just did with the Terrence product.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
In other words, I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community off.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
I don't want to piss them off.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
I want friends.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I need friends.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Now the interesting thing to me is, as we would say in the UK, it sounded to me like

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
he was talking a load of old cobblers.

13:21.000 --> 13:28.000
And yet you were there and you were being very generous and sort of reasonable and

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
decent with him and allowing him to continue with his theories.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
That's attracted for you a lot of criticism that by engaging in that manner with him,

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
you're kind of adding legitimacy to slightly unhinged science fiction rather than promoting

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
the cause of science.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
How do you respond to that?

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
First of all, this is always a scuttlebutt and people say, so I'm not very impressed

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
with that.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
I would say that you have, I wouldn't say it's mildly unhinged.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I would say it's wildly unhinged.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
A lot of this stuff is just nonsense.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
On the other hand, I was very quick to spot something that I wouldn't have been able to

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
appear with Terrence if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
And because I have a lot of background and experience in this area, it was possible for

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
me to go through what he said at a speed that I think very few people would be able to go

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
through his work.

14:30.000 --> 14:37.000
Well, what percentage of what he was saying was true or at least vaguely sensible and

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
what was completely...

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Very little.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
Right, so my question, if it was genuinely very little, him getting tens of millions of

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
views for espousing complete nonsense in the main.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
And then someone with your pedigree and your knowledge of this subject matter going on and

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
kind of going along with engaging him as a serious person in these things, is that not

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
in his own way diminishing science when you do that?

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
First of all, I wouldn't have had Terrence on the first time because it didn't do him

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
to what he actually is doing that's interesting to give him this amount of air.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
That was a good friend of mine's choice.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
So partially what you're seeing is a relationship between a comedian, Joe Rogan, and a mathematician,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Eric Weinstein.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
Joe's a buddy of mine and he matters to me.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
And he's the one who asked me to come on.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Some people tried to frame it as if I wanted to go on.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I had no interest in going on.

15:45.000 --> 15:53.000
But if we were going to watch a mass delusion take shape, certainly I don't want any more

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
mass delusions.

15:54.000 --> 16:02.000
And I also don't want the idea that once these ideas are out there that science is afraid

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
somehow to confront Terrence Howard's new theory of arithmetic.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
He doesn't have a new theory of arithmetic.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
And somebody needs to be the adult and say, this is not right.

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
On the other hand, you have to appreciate that all it takes is one great idea to move the

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
world and a lot of BS is going to be forgiven.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
And if he has a great idea, I would suggest to you it's likely his concept of a six rotor

16:35.000 --> 16:43.000
drone that he calls the Lynch pin that's based on a mathematical error where he's fit six

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
pentagons through the edges of a regular tetrahedron giving him six degrees of freedom which

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
span what we would call the Lie algebra of the affine group giving him the ability to

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
rotate around a center and move to any point in three dimensional space.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It's an incredibly cool idea.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Now I don't know that it's his.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I believe that it's his, but I don't know that.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
I haven't done that work.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm not a drone operator, so I don't realize what the state of the art is.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
But imagine that that was the only thing that he did and that he figured out that these

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
things could fit together as per the Intel drone shows to form capsids in the shape of

17:22.000 --> 17:30.000
dodecahedrons, much the way we see viruses doing that with capsimers and protein coats to

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
protect the genetic material.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
That would be an incredible contribution of Terrence Howard.

17:38.000 --> 17:48.000
And the thing that really disgusts me is watching my colleagues make fun of Terrence as easily

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
where he is right as where he is wrong.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
It doesn't require that.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
He's clearly a self-taught guy.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
He pronounces words like canonically, canonically, which indicates that he's teaching himself.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
And for all of this talk of the Neil deGrasse Tyson's where they say, I'm so pleased to see

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
active minds engaging with the world of ideas, they're really not.

18:10.000 --> 18:20.000
And my feeling about this is pretending that Terrence Howard is a fool or an idiot is repugnant to me.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
I mean, if you just take what he said about tones and the periodic table, because of some good

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
fortune in my life, I was able to go out to none other than one of the greatest musicians

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
now living, Stanley Jordan.

18:33.000 --> 18:43.000
And say, Stanley, let's share your work on playing the periodic table by using the ionization energies

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
as frequency information, much the way Terrence was discussing.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
So my feeling is, is that a lot of my colleagues just don't have enough knowledge.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
And even though they're supposedly the academics sitting in professorial seats, they're not behaving

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
like professors.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
They're not behaving like academicians.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
They're making fun of somebody because it allows them to work out their own personal insecurities.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
And that's not going to happen on my watch.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
It's actually really fascinating because unless I'm mistaken, what you're saying is, look,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
you might be wrong about 99% of his stuff.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
But the 1% might be really significant, which is staggering to me that Terrence Howard has gone

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
through life as a movie actor is suddenly doing stuff which is to you quite groundbreaking

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
in the very complex world of science and mathematics and so on.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
It's not in science and it's not in mathematics.

19:36.000 --> 19:45.000
If he's doing something that I recognize, it's in engineering, art, and it's possible that he's doing something.

19:45.000 --> 19:52.000
I was able to recognize where his shapes come from, where Neil does not appear to understand, which is fine.

19:53.000 --> 20:01.000
So there's some very beautiful geometry, but it doesn't appear to me to be at a research level.

20:01.000 --> 20:09.000
And I don't want to conflate, again, I'm hardly a pushover.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
I'm saying he's wrong in chemistry, physics, and mathematics.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
In fact, it doesn't rise to the level of a theory that needs to be actively considered.

20:19.000 --> 20:29.000
That said, to dismiss everything he's saying because we can find, you know, sometimes a fly lands in your dish

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
and you insist that it be taken back at a restaurant.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
Other times you just say, you know, five second rule, you're hungry, and it's not the fault of the restaurant.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And you just let it go.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
And my feeling about this is what Neil did is really troubling.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
What he did is that he advertised a fake openness, which is just submit what your work is to a peer review journal.

20:56.000 --> 21:04.000
Neil either doesn't know the history of peer review, doesn't know why it's called peer review, has no concept of what peer review actually is,

21:04.000 --> 21:16.000
which is bizarre, or he does know, and he's deliberately going to waste Terrence Howard's time because Terrence isn't a peer.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
And the whole concept of peer review, the word peer isn't like a jury of your peers, your fellow citizens.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
It's like peers in terms of the House of Lords.

21:27.000 --> 21:38.000
The whole idea of peer review is to keep the lady, the people who don't do science for a living or medicine for a living, out of the review process.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
And that's where it was born.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
That's why it grew up in the 60s and 70s as peer review.

21:45.000 --> 21:55.000
It was as part of a struggle where scientists wanted to wall off their kingdom and say, look, we are taking public money, but we don't want public review.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
You're not qualified to be here.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Shut up, get out of our lab and let us work.

22:00.000 --> 22:11.000
And that's why it's so fiercely defended is because it's the last ditch effort to keep the laity from interfering in matters that they can't understand.

22:11.000 --> 22:21.000
The science itself has been under probably a bigger public assault in terms of its validity as a result of the COVID pandemic.

22:21.000 --> 22:31.000
And I can never remember in my lifetime, certainly, is it damaging when everybody on social media suddenly becomes an epidemiologist,

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
wherever it may be, you know, any different type of science you like, or medical expert, whatever.

22:37.000 --> 22:45.000
When their views get amplified, like Terrence Howard, if they're completely wrong, they get amplified and shared gazillions of times.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
This has happened here with all of the things that he said.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Is it damaging to the integrity of science when that happens?

22:51.000 --> 22:59.000
And is that a unique problem with social media, amplifying amateur scientific and medical views?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
It's a very interesting question.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I would think that we would begin somewhere else.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
The greatest damage is when we amplify pseudoscientists who happen to be official pseudoscientists.

23:13.000 --> 23:29.000
So when you take a director of NAI, National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, and you take that person's contradictory pronouncements

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
and you amplify those, then suddenly everybody has to learn what mRNA is.

23:34.000 --> 23:41.000
Because they're trying to make a decision for their child and suddenly you've thrust them into advanced biology

23:41.000 --> 23:50.000
because you've amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institute of Health or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DITRA.

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
The failure and the pseudoscience is coming from inside the house.

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
The problem is when a Francis Collins and an Anthony Fauci in private emails can turn their dissenting colleagues,

24:04.000 --> 24:12.000
fully competent expert dissident colleagues like Jay Bhattacharya and his colleagues at Harvard and Oxford,

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
and overnight they become fringe epidemiologists, right?

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
So more or less what you're seeing is not a failure of science.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
What you're seeing is a failure of science to disavow public health.

24:25.000 --> 24:38.000
Public health is not science. Public health is an incredibly bizarre field that tries to straddle two worlds of actual truth and the noble lie.

24:38.000 --> 24:48.000
And as I've said before, the problem is the failure to cancel an ex-spouse's credit card privileges.

24:48.000 --> 24:56.000
When the person takes the credit card on a spree, science did not cancel its credit card that it had given to public health.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
And so what we had was an incredible destruction of trust in science, which is completely unwarranted

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
because people who are not acting as scientists, who may have at one time been scientists,

25:08.000 --> 25:14.000
but have gone over to public policy, were allowed to lie on science's behalf.

25:14.000 --> 25:22.000
That's a failure. I understand why the credit rating got beaten up, but for God's sakes, just cut off the credit card

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
and learn where scientists lie and where they do not. They don't lie generically.

25:27.000 --> 25:33.000
There's nothing wrong with Hook's law. There's nothing wrong with the adapter hypothesis in biology.

25:33.000 --> 25:41.000
There's nothing wrong with most of what we consider to be science. We lie in very special places out of necessity.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
Let me bring in the other two guests now to debate actually what you've been saying.

25:46.000 --> 25:53.000
Professor Brian Keating, cosmologist from San Diego University and Tom Billio, who's the Impact Theory podcast.

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
Professor Keating, your response to what you've just been hearing from Eric?

25:59.000 --> 26:06.000
Well, I think scientists, we have a responsibility. Eric's known for calling the term the intellectual dark web.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
And I feel like a scientist, we have a responsibility to keep the environmental, intellectual environment clear of pollution.

26:14.000 --> 26:22.000
And I feel like there is a tendency because of this anti-authoritarian moment that we seem to be in to view science as authoritarian.

26:22.000 --> 26:31.000
And then to rebel against it, we look to heroes and people like Terrence or Candace Owens or people like Tucker Carlson.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
And they get enormous platforms because of their social media stature.

26:35.000 --> 26:46.000
But to me, to listen to people who have no domain expertise and no proven track record is an affront to actual practicing scientists.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
And it's fine to have a hobby. It's fine to do things out of an avocation of love for it.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
But it's a bit, to me, an example of the halo effect, which is a cognitive bias.

26:55.000 --> 27:04.000
And you have people you're listening to. In some cases, it's akin to listening to your friend, Piers, and your Tate for marital advice.

27:04.000 --> 27:14.000
He may be a great MMA star and Terrence may be a great actor, but that gives them no and confers no benefit to their scientific practices.

27:14.000 --> 27:22.000
And it would be like me going on to the set of Iron Man and trying to be like Terrence. You would laugh me off the stage and rightfully so.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
So we have to look at an exam and these claims that amateurs can do good science.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Eric pointed out in the interview that there's some babies in with the bathwater.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
And I'd love to ask my dear friend, Eric, to expound upon those particular babies.

27:37.000 --> 27:45.000
Because to me, to say that there might be some angle or something like that or some drone, it sounds to me a little bit like damning with faint praise as well.

27:45.000 --> 27:53.000
Because if you go through and there's 97 patents that he claims he has, we go through them, we find out that very few of them have been granted.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
There may be a couple that have been granted.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
You go through one times one equals two. Eric demonstrated clearly that's not the case.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
You go through the periodic table. His ideas are completely wrong there.

28:05.000 --> 28:13.000
His claims about gravity and building planets, that he's built the planet Saturn or comes out of a biological digestive process of the sun.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
These things are completely fallacious.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
So I think there's a danger and it's a symptom of the halo effect.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.000
I mean, just in point about Andrew Tate, he's not a friend of mine. He's someone I've interviewed three times.

28:26.000 --> 28:36.000
But the point I make about him at this debate with someone the other day is he has a huge following on social media, regardless of whether people like me interview him.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
At least when I interview him, I get a chance to challenge him.

28:40.000 --> 28:47.000
And I've really noticed when young men in particular come up to me in the street, which they do with alarming regularity about Andrew Tate,

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
that actually the conversation I have with him has moved from, God, you know, Andrew Tate is amazing.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
I really liked it when you challenged him about this, this and this.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
In other words, shining a light on people like Andrew Tate actually challenging them on a big platform.

29:04.000 --> 29:11.000
I see tangible impact on the street of those challenges kicking through into people's consciousness.

29:11.000 --> 29:18.000
You know, where they wouldn't if he was just able to do his thing slightly below radar on social media without ever being challenged.

29:18.000 --> 29:26.000
So that's my kind of theory about why I interview people like him, which is in itself open to debate, obviously.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
Eric, just in that response to the baby and bathwater, what would you say to Brian Keating's point there?

29:33.000 --> 29:42.000
Well, I tried to say it already that if you take the vertices of a tetrahedron as measured from the center,

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
you're looking at an angle of the arc cosine of minus one-third, which is about 109.47 in degrees.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
And if you take the interior angles of a regular pentagon, it's 108.

29:53.000 --> 30:00.000
So 108 is not 109.47, but it is close enough so that within engineering tolerances,

30:00.000 --> 30:08.000
you can put six of these motors into a regular tetrahedron and then you can potentially, therefore,

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
traverse all of the dimensions needed to orient the object around its center of mass and to move it to any point three-dimensional space.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
I've stated that clearly to any technical person who wants to hear it.

30:20.000 --> 30:27.000
It may be that there's prior art and it may be that it doesn't end up being that interesting because of the tolerances or it's too difficult to work.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
That's fine, but I've already stated what the baby is.

30:31.000 --> 30:38.000
And further, Brian, I was very surprised that you just corrected me on social media.

30:38.000 --> 30:45.000
Now, of course, we're friends and so I don't mind having this back and forth, but you've stated that in my field,

30:45.000 --> 30:53.000
that peer review is much older than Gillain Maxwell, who was born in 1961.

30:53.000 --> 31:01.000
And you cited a bunch of journals in physics and, in fact, that's simply not true.

31:01.000 --> 31:14.000
Well, I have Melinda Baldwin's article here, which says, however, most papers accepted for physical review never went out to referees at all.

31:14.000 --> 31:21.000
The editor accepted most papers on its own authority, consulting referees only when he thought he might want to reject a paper.

31:21.000 --> 31:28.000
It was not until the 1960s that all physical review papers were sent out for external referee opinion.

31:28.000 --> 31:41.000
More or less, peer review comes out of Utah in 1972 through Senator Wallace Bennett's amendment that forces the issue into the NIH framework

31:41.000 --> 31:50.000
because the Medicare Act was established in 1965 making the U.S. taxpayer responsible for medical payments

31:50.000 --> 31:56.000
that they suddenly wanted access to knowing why are we paying all of this money to doctors without the ability to question them.

31:56.000 --> 32:05.000
So, in part, what I'm astounded by is that we're not even aware of our own history.

32:05.000 --> 32:16.000
If George Green, the Miller, with no formal education mailed off a solution to an inversion problem for differential operators,

32:16.000 --> 32:24.000
which is what gives us Green's functions, which Feynman made famous, he didn't have any training whatsoever.

32:24.000 --> 32:32.000
It's in part very dangerous to be offended when people listen to what we say.

32:32.000 --> 32:39.000
And they then say, I keep hearing that science is for everyone and that mathematics is a great place to play.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
There are no bad questions.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
And then when they appear to take an interest, we cut their heads off.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
And my feeling is that I'm not going to do that.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I'm going to state what this is.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
This is an elite activity.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
It's elite the way a violinist is elite.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
It's elite the way a surgeon is an elite brain surgeon.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
You're not going to have somebody say, hey, I've been doing brain surgery in my backyard on my family members and I'm ready for prime time.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
We are not honest about the extent that this is an elite community.

33:14.000 --> 33:29.000
And the last thing that I would add to what you said is part of the problem is where are the dissident scientists who don't go along inside of the university system, inside of the research institutions?

33:29.000 --> 33:40.000
If you had them, they would have been tarred and feathered during DEI because they would have said, who are these foreign intruders into the academic arena?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
We must fire them and get them out.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Claudine Gay could never have become president of Harvard.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
What we've done is we've gotten rid of all of the dissenting experts.

33:50.000 --> 34:00.000
And the dissenting experts who are going to get up and at the top of their lungs say, hey, we've got a disaster in theoretical physics at the moment.

34:00.000 --> 34:13.000
We have an abomination in the way in which we are pretending that random mutation is decidedly the main engine of Darwinian selection.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
We're going to pretend that neoclassical economics is on solid ground.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
All of these things are just absolutely silly.

34:24.000 --> 34:33.000
And effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.

34:33.000 --> 34:45.000
And I promise you that it's more expensive to get rid of your dissenters who actually know what they're talking about than it is to open it up to a public that wonders whether they've just shortened the life of their child

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
by giving them an unnecessary experimental pseudo-vaccine.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
All right, let me bring in Tom if you're waiting very patiently.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
Tom, what's your perspective on this?

34:55.000 --> 35:02.000
So I think the key thing to understand is if you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science, you have already lost.

35:02.000 --> 35:09.000
So the goal here has to be to understand that we are living in the age of conspiracy, and that is the problem.

35:09.000 --> 35:20.000
When I saw the interview with Terrence Howard and Joe Rogan the first time, I just about dislocated my finger dialing Eric to call him up to be like, hey, you have to refute this stuff.

35:20.000 --> 35:34.000
And the reason that I was very excited to see that he went on and did that and did that so well, Eric, you are a national treasure, is that it does not matter to me what the elites think in isolation.

35:35.000 --> 35:42.000
All that happens is if people have an idea that hits a critical mass, they begin to bifurcate.

35:42.000 --> 35:48.000
I mean, this is like the multiverse where we no longer have a shared vision of what is true.

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
That has second and third order consequences that I think are going to be terrifying for the nation.

35:54.000 --> 36:09.000
And when you have a thinker like Eric, who can actually go through and say, hey, let me steal, man, what I have heard you say, which Joe and Terrence would not let him do, which I was mortified by, because he should have just laid it out.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Here are the base assumptions, and then we're going to build up from that.

36:12.000 --> 36:22.000
Now, the reason that I want that to happen is when an idea, whether it is terrible, whether it is obviously terrible, whether every elite person in the world who does science is like, this is the worst idea ever.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
You have to understand because of a whole host of things, but certainly COVID being a nice mile marker for us.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
It broke people's trust in elites to lead us properly.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
It broke our trust in science.

36:37.000 --> 36:42.000
And so now you must, in fact, I will say, scientists, I love you all.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You have no obligation to do what I'm saying.

36:44.000 --> 36:56.000
I beseech you as somebody who wants society to move forward well, that if an idea hits a certain level of critical mass in the public's awareness, even if you hate it, you are going to have to address it.

36:56.000 --> 37:08.000
If you want to lead us well forward, but you have to do it based on base assumptions so that anybody following along at home that's trying to build their thinking up can go, oh, I actually understand Terrence's base assumptions.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
One times one equals two.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
All things are in motion.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
There's no straight lines like things that, OK, have I understood your position perfectly Terrence?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Yes, Eric, you have.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
OK, amazing.

37:20.000 --> 37:28.000
Now I'm going to walk through each of those base assumptions and show you which ones are broken and how that is going to make the rest of your sequencing fall apart.

37:28.000 --> 37:36.000
If people would just stay focused on utility, these beliefs work in the real world, we would be in a much better position.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
That's what I want to see more of.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
OK, let me bring Brian in.

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
Before I come to you, Brian, though, I want to play a clip from Candice Owens.

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
This was several days after the debate that Rogan and Terrence had.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Why I am now rejecting the cult of science.

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
So many things that they've lied to us about vaccines, birth control, people that are being injured and that we just accept everything.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
What I said was that science has become a pagan faith.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Yes, that's what I actually believe.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
Do you want to say that NASA has satanic origins and so on?

38:08.000 --> 38:17.000
Now, I interviewed Candice myself recently and she's a bona fide anti-vaccine, doesn't believe in vaccines at all.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
And she has a big following.

38:19.000 --> 38:29.000
And there are lots of people like her out there now saying that because there have been legitimate areas of concern around the COVID vaccines,

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
that everything about them is flawed and wrong.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
And therefore all the scientists who promoted them are the devil.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
And this stuff gathers momentum.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I see it spreading like wildfire.

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
She also says that Emmanuel Macron's wife is a man by having had three kids and so on.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
And these things gather their own momentum.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
And whilst on one level it's sort of humorous,

38:53.000 --> 39:00.000
on another level it's actually, I think, very damaging because it means that scientists can never be wrong again.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
Because if they're wrong about any one aspect of a big thing like a COVID pandemic,

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
which is fast moving and evolving and changing, if they're wrong about any aspect of it,

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
the whole thing gets trashed by this community.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
This is why we have to understand that this is about the age of conspiracy.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
The very thing that Eric, I think, is trying to combat is to say,

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
science is about figuring out where we are wrong.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
And if scientists stake their reputation as they have done over the last four or five years entirely on always being right,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
then if I can pull one thread and it falls apart, everything is dead.

39:34.000 --> 39:41.000
But if science just gets behind Feynman's statement that this is about distrusting experts and figuring out where they're wrong,

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
now it can become a far more fruitful pursuit of what actually works.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
Okay, Brian, Brian, your thoughts on that?

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
Yeah, Tom, just because someone's an expert doesn't necessarily mean that you have to distrust them.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
When you look at something, there's a concept called Brandolini's Law,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
which my kids are nearby, so I'm not going to say in its full terms.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
But it's basically that it's 10 times easier to produce something that's BS,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
and so then it is to refute it.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
Therefore, the world is full of unrefuted BS.

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
And to put that on scientists, to make us sort of the intellectual SEAL Team 6,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
where we can never be wrong.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
The terrorists only have to be right once.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
And everyone else is relying on us, SEAL Team 6, that we're never wrong.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
To put that in perspective, when you listen to people like this,

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
Candace tweeting from her laptop and enabled by technology that was invented at Bell Labs,

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
the byproduct of the space race, which she also denies, moon landings and so forth.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
We're not in New Age.

40:43.000 --> 40:51.000
We're in a pre-scientific age where people can unfortunately spread not scientific truth

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
via scientific proof, which Eric, I'm sorry to say.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
My academic genealogy goes back 17 generations.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
Every single one of those people, including my students,

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
now in my third generation, I have graduate students out of their own graduate students,

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
they've all been through peer review.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
We didn't have Pergamum Press and Robert Maxwell, that is true.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Einstein published almost all of his famous papers.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
They were done by peer review.

41:12.000 --> 41:18.000
In fact, the discovery of gravitational waves, one of the most revolutionary discoveries in all of science.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
That prediction, he first tried to get submitted in the early 1930s,

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
and he didn't want to get a peer review, and there was an error in it.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
He said it would never be detected.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Imagine that.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Einstein made a mistake.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
But thanks to peer review, that paper was published in 1936,

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
and it went on to win the Nobel Prize for some of my good friends.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
I've interviewed 20 Nobel laureates on my podcast,

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
and three of them won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the thing that Einstein thought was impossible.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
We can go back many, many generations, and yes, they didn't have presses.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
Of course, the printing press was only a relatively recent invention,

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
but you go to the peer review process.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
Not far from where peers is right now is the Royal Society,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
and also not too far away is the Royal Institution.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
I've been to both places.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
I've lectured there, and when you go to those places, yes, there wasn't a press,

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
but you gather your peers around you, and you do an experiment,

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
and that experiment would either fail or pass in real time,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and you would get feedback from a jury.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Okay.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
No jury of the peers.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Okay.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
Eric, it seems like watching Elon Musk goes with him, actually, the other day.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I have to respond to that.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Okay, respond first.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Brian, what you just said is not true.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
You know, it's just, the fact is, is that Einstein...

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
The Einstein paper was not published in 1936 after peer review there?

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
Sorry, that was John Tate, who was the editor at Physical Review before Simon Pasternak,

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
before Sam Goodschmidt.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
Yes, it is true that most of Einstein's work was not peer reviewed.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
That's why he was incensed.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
He'd never sent another paper to Physical Review if I'm not incorrect.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Please check me on it.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Was that paper reviewed?

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
The fact is, there was one paper with Rosen that was peer reviewed,

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
which incensed Einstein because he was used to not being peer reviewed.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
And he was wrong about it.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
In other words, until peer review pointed out by Eddington, Eddington helped out as well

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
and said that there was another and it's calculation.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Peer review is not referee review, right?

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
We had external referees that were occasionally sought,

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
but what you cite about the Royal Society is, in fact,

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
an error introduced into the literature by Merton.

43:32.000 --> 43:40.000
The famous historian of science who was the father of the Merton, of Black Scholes Merton fame.

43:40.000 --> 43:48.000
And that was an erroneous claim that peer review began, I think, in the 1700s.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
What we currently call peer review is far more recent

43:52.000 --> 44:02.000
and it is fantastic to find out that our professor does not know the history of peer review in its own subjects

44:02.000 --> 44:10.000
because what we have is we have a chorus of people with the highest credentials repeating a fable.

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
And we can't always tell when malware has entered our minds.

44:17.000 --> 44:23.000
But I would submit to you, sir, that despite your pedigree, in general,

44:23.000 --> 44:32.000
your predecessors were not peer reviewed in any modern sense of the term before the 1970s,

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
certainly before the 1960s.

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
The beginning of forms for external referees begins, I think, in the 1930s under John Tate.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
I just don't think you know the history.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
I don't know. And in fact, I invite you to go down to the Royal Institution next time you're in London

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
and you'll see pictures of Michael Faraday, of J.J. Thompson, of Eddington.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
You'll see them in front of audiences. Was there a peer review process before journals?

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
When would they be journal nature?

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
The average person is perfect in themselves in the face right now.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
As somebody that loves you two, literally, I know both these guys. Eric, I know very well.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Both have been on my show. Brian, I love you guys.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
So I say this because I am begging you.

45:14.000 --> 45:20.000
The average person wants to chew through their TV set right now or their laptop as they're listening to this.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
And the reason is they don't care about this.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
It's already done.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Sorry, sorry.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Hold on. Let me finish. Let me finish.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
The world cares about people like they want to hear what Joe Rogan has to say.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
They want to hear who goes on his show.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
They are absolutely going to listen to Candice.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
I think, Brian, you brought that up. Candice is about to sweep the world.

45:39.000 --> 45:46.000
And if I could just get you guys on board with the reality that we are in a very difficult moment right now,

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
where, yes, you guys are being asked to do a public service,

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
which is to collide with these people who do not have your scientific bona fides,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
but the average person does not care,

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
but they will actually listen to your collision of ideas for sure,

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
because I took a lot away from you talking to Terrence.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
And the first time I heard Terrence, I was like, maybe this is genius. I don't know.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.000
You know, it's so interesting. I was going to say, actually, Eric,

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
earlier that I saw Elon Musk recently, many of the first time,

46:14.000 --> 46:22.000
and he did a fascinating Q&A about everything from colonising Mars to humanoid robots and so on.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
But I also, we talked about X and his purchase of Twitter and then two X.

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
One of the best things I've seen in terms of populist peer review is community notes now on X,

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
where I often see things which are spinning around, which are complete nonsense,

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
and then you see a very well-sourced community note killing it.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
And it does seem to have an effect, because that in itself, because it's happening in the same medium,

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
starts to also spread like wildfire and tends to kill them quite quickly.

46:52.000 --> 47:00.000
Are you a fan of what Elon is doing with X? Is this helping it as a populist peer reviewing?

47:00.000 --> 47:08.000
Yeah, again, this is one of these Wild West conversations where it's not peer review.

47:08.000 --> 47:16.000
The whole concept of peer review is peer, and community notes is community, right?

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
And so in a certain sense, the point is it's an anti-peer review.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
It's working pretty well right now.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
But keep in mind that Wikipedia worked pretty well until people figured out how to game it.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
So my concern is, is that what you're looking at with peer review and with community notes,

47:34.000 --> 47:44.000
which is anti-peer review, if you will, is technologies that are in the process of being probed and gamed.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
And just to refute what Tom was saying before, Tom, I don't disagree at all.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
We are going to have to deal with the Candace phenomena.

47:51.000 --> 47:58.000
But the reason the Candace phenomenon is happening is that you don't have any expert dissident opinion.

47:58.000 --> 48:05.000
If you have five professors shout me down that I don't know what I'm talking about with respect to peer review,

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
and I happen to be completely right, I will be told that I'm not an academic,

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
despite the fact that we all speak the same language and have the same credentials.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
What is going on is that the world is not crying out for Candace Owen.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
It's crying out for where is the physician with my daughter's interests at heart?

48:22.000 --> 48:29.000
Where is the biologist who's willing to stand up to a Tony Fauci and say, I completely disagree?

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
Why is it that we keep having these fake consensus?

48:34.000 --> 48:40.000
And these consensus are basically determined by getting rid of the people who won't shut up

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
and who won't sit down and who won't sing from the hymnal.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
And what I'm trying to say is what you just saw was an interchange between two colleagues

48:48.000 --> 48:56.000
with a great deal of love and respect for each other on an issue where I'm claiming that the good professor is simply an error.

48:56.000 --> 49:02.000
And if you had somebody saying that around the Wuhan lab and the origin of COVID

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
or the potential danger of the vaccines or the liability regime in which they were negotiated,

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
that this is an abomination, that we can't sue the manufacturers,

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
you would have a totally different world. Nobody would be listening to Candace Owen.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
They would be trying to track Jay Bhattacharya.

49:19.000 --> 49:26.000
They would be trying to track all of the experts who were standing up with their interests at heart.

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
The big problem in the United States is we used to have experts in the right chairs who dissented.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
And now what you have is a group of people who know to keep their head down.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
Brian, just want to end with just quick thoughts from you and Tom before we finish.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
Give me some hope about the future of science.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
Clearly, I think it's indisputable that science and the integrity of science and scientists

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
has never been under a bigger attack than it is today.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
A lot of it fueled by conspiracy theorists and social media.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
Give me some hope for the future of science and its integrity.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
I think the hope comes from my students, the people that I work with,

50:03.000 --> 50:09.000
the incredible breakthroughs that I've been witness to both personally and part of a team of 300 scientists

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
that are working to uncover what happened during the first nanosecond in the cosmos's history.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
What kind of breakthroughs do we now unlock knowing that the universe is suffused with dark energy?

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
What do we learn about the future possibly with new technology like high temperature,

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
room temperature, superconductivity, or perhaps fusion?

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
That's never been a more exciting time to be a scientist.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
And they hear about science as its best days are behind us.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
I think that's nonsense.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.000
On the other hand, we have to guard against conspiracy theories and flat earthers

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
and all sorts of anti-vaxxers and things like that because there is always a grain of truth.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
As Isaac Asimov said, if you believe the earth is flat, you're wrong.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
But if you believe it's perfectly round two, you're also wrong, but you're less wrong.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
And I think what we want to do as scientists is not be held to this impossible secret service level

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
where we can't make a single mistake.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
Recognize that we do make mistakes, but science is self-correcting.

51:02.000 --> 51:07.000
And part of that self-correction mechanism has to do with being analyzed by your peers.

51:07.000 --> 51:13.000
Whatever Eric and I disagree with about in the past, today's peer review is perhaps, as I like to say,

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
it's the worst system for gauging scientific process except for all the rest.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Tom?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
All right.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
So the thing that I really want to make sure that I'm being heard on, Brian,

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
is you keep repeating, we shouldn't be held to this team, CL team six level of perfection.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
What I'm saying is silence, science has a branding problem.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
You guys created a branding problem.

51:35.000 --> 51:41.000
I'll just say during COVID where it was, hey, everybody listened to us and everything is going to be fine.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
Masks don't work, by the way, but save them for the health workers because they need them.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
It's like, so everyone's brain starts sketching out.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Also, no one has talked about social media yet.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Social media, this is done.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
The horses are out of the stable.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
The toothpaste is all over the floor.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
The genie has flown out of the bottle.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
We are living in a reality where everybody is a publisher.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
Everybody is going to say things and people are screaming out for Candace Owens.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
I'm telling you right now, as somebody, I'm almost sure I'm going to disagree with every word out of her mouth.

52:10.000 --> 52:18.000
And yet I am utterly fascinated by how she has already captured people in terms of their imagination because this is what they want.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
As a marketer, I can tell you, you guys are terrible.

52:21.000 --> 52:27.000
Like if I have to market you, oh God, even though I look at Eric and I'm like, is this the smartest human I've ever encountered?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
For sure.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
Do I want him at my house just whispering in my ear all the things to do?

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
Absolutely.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
My life will be way better.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
However, from a marketing perspective, oh dear God.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
So it's like we have a much bigger challenge that we have to overcome.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
And Candace doesn't have that problem.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
She's electrifying.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
She captures what people want to hear.

52:46.000 --> 52:54.000
And what I'm saying is the service that you guys can now play in the world that we live in is to say science isn't about being right.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Science is about two things.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
Number one, the pursuit of utility.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
Einstein's breakthroughs matter because they give us GPS and nuclear energy.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
That's the only reason that they matter.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
And the second thing is we know we're wrong about a whole lot of stuff.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
And so our job is just go through what are all the things we're wrong about that are stopping us?

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
And I hope I'm not talking out of class, Eric.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Oh, please God.

53:18.000 --> 53:26.000
But Eric has said to me many times, we ought to be traveling the cosmos and we aren't because string theory has gotten stuck.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Exactly.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
So you have to get new ideas.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
You have to break the old paradigms in order to get the utility that you want.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
And if we judge every idea by its utility and not by where it comes from, we'll be in a much better place.

53:39.000 --> 53:53.000
You know that the best thing about this debate, Tom, is that it's actually by having this kind of conversation on a platform like this that is watched globally in pretty big numbers now that we can probably get to where you want to get science to.

53:53.000 --> 54:00.000
And the other thing I observe is I host a lot of debates between people who disagree and they normally end up screaming at each other.

54:00.000 --> 54:07.000
What I loved about you three was the more abusive you became in a very nice polite manner, the more you all laughed.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
And that is the way to debate.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
So thank you all very much indeed.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Thank you, Pierce.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Thank you.
