2. Science communicators, including Eric, Pierce, and Brian, recognize that scientists are not infallible and should not be held to an unattainable standard of perfection. Instead, science is a self-correcting process that benefits from peer review and open discussion.

3. Social media has exacerbated the issue by allowing anyone to publish information, which can lead to the spread of misinformation or conspiracy theories. This creates a challenge for scientists who must communicate effectively amidst a sea of competing voices, including those like Candace Owens who may not be scientifically accurate but are persuasive communicators.

5. The debate between the three hosts was conducted in a respectful yet spirited manner, demonstrating that constructive disagreement can lead to mutual understanding and, ultimately, progress in science communication.

6. Brian thanks Pierce for highlighting the importance of how science is communicated and the need for scientists to engage with the public in a way that is relatable and emphasizes the value of science for everyday life.
