0	5800	Dr. Eric Weinstein is a Harvard-trained mathematician and a titan of the so-called
5800	11760	Intellectual Dark Web. They're the big iconoclastic thinkers who span political divides to challenge
11760	18720	mainstream narratives, stoking controversy and debate along the way. Dr. Weinstein tackles
18720	23200	everything from Putin and Ukraine to globalization, and Jeffrey Epstein has become a superstar
23200	26800	guest on the world's biggest podcast and streaming shows.
26800	29640	You met Jeffrey Epstein.
29640	34400	The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. There are people that you need in your dark
34400	37960	hours. As soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.
37960	45960	And now he goes uncensored. I'm always surprised when people with your kind of intellect wrestle
45960	52280	with any kind of quandary about Russian dictator invading sovereign democratic country.
52280	57480	International nations like Russia have concerns that don't have to do only with their exact
57480	58480	borders.
58480	63400	I mean, do you think anyone like Putin who has 6,000 nuclear weapons at his disposal
63400	67120	would want to start a war that would obliterate everything?
67120	71360	And somebody, a pair of nunchucks, they're most likely to knock themselves out rather
71360	75480	than to become Bruce Lee. We sit here with a ticking time bomb. We don't know how long
75480	76480	we have.
76920	83560	The four most overrated things in life were lobster, champagne, anal sex, and picnics.
83560	87480	I don't really know much about champagne. Perhaps the next question.
87480	90280	Are there any limits to free speech?
90280	96360	It has morphed more into a question of what can I get away with that might not be true?
96360	98920	I've got 10 things. Rapid fire.
98920	102520	No, no, no. Yeah, I decline. No, I'm quite serious.
103520	106520	Eric Weisd, great to have you.
106520	108520	Good to be with you.
108520	111520	So I was just checking your Wikipedia a minute ago.
111520	113520	And under education it said...
113520	115520	It has a bitty face recently.
115520	119520	Well, you can challenge this if you like, but under education it said Weinstein received
119520	126520	his PhD in Mathematical Physics from Harvard University in 1992 in his dissertation Extension
126520	131520	of Self-Duel Yang-Mills Equations Across the Eighth Dimension.
131520	136520	Weinstein showed that the self-duel Yang-Mills Equations were not peculiar to Dimension 4
136520	139520	and admitted generalizations to higher dimensions.
139520	144520	And I realized at that point, having read that, Eric, that you and I were probably on
144520	150520	slightly different intellectual pathways in our lives, and this might be quite a challenging encounter.
152520	154520	You have a different theory about the Yang-Mills Equations.
154520	159520	By the way, that's the most accurate thing I've heard in my Wikipedia entry sometimes.
159520	161520	Maybe things are improving.
161520	164520	I mean, look, obviously you've got a massive brain.
164520	169520	Do you think that's been a force for good or for angst in your life?
171520	173520	Yeah, I see evil isn't on the table.
173520	175520	It can be. I avoided that.
175520	177520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
177520	183520	I mean, to be honest, I hope it's inspiring to people with learning differences
183520	185520	and neurodivergence everywhere.
185520	187520	I was a terrible student in high school.
188520	190520	So, to me, it's quite funny.
190520	192520	I mean, I don't know what to say.
192520	197520	It speaks to the triumph of will and the power of dyslexia.
197520	201520	The intellectual dark web is its core.
201520	205520	I've interviewed many people from Miss Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson,
205520	207520	Professor Stephen Pinker, and so on.
207520	211520	And the common themes seem to be people who just decide that they're not going to accept
211520	216520	everything that the mainstream media pumps out to the public.
216520	220520	They want to challenge, you know, what I would call group think.
220520	224520	They want to challenge tribalism, particularly fueled by social media.
224520	228520	They just want to be, I guess, annoyingly curious and combative
228520	232520	about stuff that we're told collectively we have to believe.
234520	236520	I think it's a lot more than that.
236520	241520	I mean, I never explained who was in it nor what it meant.
241520	243520	So people try to wrap ideas around it.
243520	249520	One of the reasons that it gained currency was that no one had a description for the fact
249520	255520	that many smart people were not going along with the sort of intellectual hegemony
255520	260520	of the mainstream, which should represent a huge diversity of viewpoints.
260520	263520	But in fact, that's only honored in the breach.
263520	269520	I think that one of the things that is not frequently thought about in terms of that project
269520	271520	was the importance of civility.
271520	278520	It's incredibly difficult to tease out our differences when we're yelling at each other,
278520	285520	calling names, and in point of fact, I believe that we've lost the ability to have good fights.
285520	286520	Our fights are terrible.
286520	287520	I totally agree.
287520	294520	We can't get good people to sit down because without intellectual Queensbury rules,
294520	296520	all you get is eye gouging.
296520	302520	And while there's a segment of the internet that's always looking for somebody to rip off an arm
302520	308520	and lose a digit, most of us want to live to see another day and continue to develop our points
308520	311520	and even concede when the other person has a better one.
311520	316520	So the dirty little secret of the intellectual dark web is that even though we were across
316520	321520	the political spectrum, we were pretty darn good to each other for a long time.
321520	323520	And I think that that's the key to getting great fights.
323520	327520	What I've noticed is that Ben Shapiro still has a pinned tweet.
327520	329520	I think facts don't care about your feelings.
329520	338520	And I've definitely noticed in debates that people go ad hominem very quickly and very abusively,
338520	345520	normally to mask the fact that their actual argument is devoid of fact.
345520	349520	Well, when you don't have a point, it's an excellent tactic.
349520	352520	Where are we in the world right now, Eric?
352520	356520	You've written and spoken so much about the state of the world,
356520	361520	but I always say to people that if you actually look at it statistically,
361520	364520	this is the best time to ever be alive.
364520	369520	We're living longer, we're living healthier, there's less child poverty, there are fewer wars and so on and so on.
369520	374520	By every conceivable metric, this is arguably the best time to ever be alive
374520	377520	and yet so many people seem so angst ridden.
377520	380520	Young people have an epidemic of anxiety.
380520	384520	And a lot of people having real problems just dealing with life
384520	389520	when in fact compared to all their ancestors, they've got it good.
389520	391520	Why?
391520	396520	Well, see, you've got to stop drinking with Steven Pinkler.
396520	400520	It was actually him that said that, you're right.
400520	401520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
401520	405520	Well, this is a terrible idea that was spread by Steven Pinker.
405520	410520	And what it is to borrow from my physics and math background
410520	414520	is you can't understand the conservation of energy
414520	417520	if you don't have terms for both potential and kinetic energy.
417520	420520	So if you think about what you're talking about,
420520	424520	you're talking about the cessation of all kinds of, in some sense, human kinetic energy
424520	429520	from the early part of the 20th century with all of the two terrible wars,
429520	431520	a horrible pandemic, et cetera.
431520	434520	We don't see that much in the world.
434520	439520	Only Mao's leap forward, I think, rises to that level of atrocity.
439520	441520	So that has been a huge improvement.
441520	447520	The problem is why that is the case, which is largely because in 1952-53,
447520	453520	over six months, we acquired the secrets to both the atom and the cell.
453520	457520	So with the first hydrogen bomb named Ivy Mike in the Pacific
457520	462520	and Watson and Crick's elucidation of the double helix structure for nucleic acid,
462520	466520	we became godlike in terms of our power.
466520	471520	And as a result, we acquired the first time, for the first time,
471520	473520	the ability to end the human project.
473520	478520	And I think it's the loss of an indefinite human future that has to be restored
478520	480520	and no one can figure out how to do it.
480520	484520	So we sit here effectively with a ticking time bomb.
484520	486520	We don't know how long we have.
486520	489520	And things are very pleasant.
489520	495520	I mean, you can sit in a coffee shop and have a perfectly good life,
495520	497520	but you never know when the end is coming.
497520	503520	Whereas in a previous era, you didn't know how often you were going to be conscripted into a war.
503520	507520	But on the other hand, there was no chance of humans extinguishing themselves.
507520	510520	So I think you really have to broaden that concept.
510520	517520	And I would agree with you in terms of the realized terror that has engulfed the world.
517520	520520	In fact, most of it is potential terror.
520520	523520	Did you watch Oppenheim in the movie?
523520	524520	Sure.
524520	526520	What did you think of it?
526520	529520	It's very tough.
529520	537520	I don't think people remember that we have this power and that it was unleashed by science
537520	543520	and in particular was unleashed by effectively my former colleagues.
543520	548520	So that when you see a cameo appearance by Richard Feynman, let's say,
548520	552520	or at least someone portraying him,
552520	559520	you have to recognize that these are the people who unleashed the doomsday scenario.
559520	567520	And for me, because we ceased exploding atmospheric nuclear weapons in 1962, I believe,
567520	573520	we've really grown far too, I don't know how to say it,
573520	577520	we're too unconcerned with the danger in which we live.
577520	582520	And for me, it was an attempt to reawaken our self-knowledge
582520	586520	and to remind ourselves how important science is,
586520	591520	how currently we say that scientists are feeble, they don't live in the real world.
591520	597520	I promise you, you'll be living in their world for the rest of time.
597520	603520	This is very much the real world and it was painful in part, but it was a very intriguing film.
603520	608520	When Vladimir Putin rattles his nuclear sabre,
608520	613520	which he does regularly as a form of trying to intimidate the West in particular,
613520	620520	do you think he means it? Do you think anyone like Putin, who has 6,000 nuclear weapons at his disposal,
620520	624520	is ever, I don't know whether the stupid isn't the right word,
624520	632520	is ever going to be in a position where he would want to start a war that would obliterate everything?
632520	635520	You can ask the same of us.
635520	637520	Yeah.
637520	642520	I'm quite serious.
642520	649520	In terms of a cultural difference, the Russians regularly use nuclear explosions for engineering purposes.
649520	652520	They have a comfort with nuclear weapons that we lack.
652520	656520	I think that many Americans do not really understand the cultural difference
656520	663520	between Central and Eastern Europe and the modern West, which is frankly terrifying.
664520	671520	I see cross-cultural miscommunication as a potential start to a nuclear scenario.
671520	675520	As we've seen from the Cold War, there have been many situations in which,
675520	681520	if there's a glitch in a system and you believe that somebody is firing upon you,
681520	684520	that you're forced to make a very tough decision.
684520	689520	Quite honestly, humans are just not good enough to play this kind of game theory.
689520	694520	And remember that with the Cold War, it was basically a bipolar conflict.
694520	697520	You're about to move to multi-polar game theory,
697520	701520	and I can assure you that it's a much less stable scenario
701520	704520	where you're trying to figure out what eight different players are doing
704520	709520	with regional conflicts and unannounced nuclear powers entering the fray.
709520	715520	Do you worry more about nuclear Armageddon or AI becoming sentient?
716520	723520	I worry about people trying to make AI a more pressing problem than nuclear weapons.
723520	726520	A lot of the cool kids in Silicon Valley have developed a meme,
726520	730520	which is that, oh, AI is far more dangerous than nukes.
730520	736520	And that may be in the long run, but at the moment, it's not even close.
736520	740520	However, it feels kind of passe to worry about nuclear weapons.
740520	747520	Five years ago or so, I think I started publicly calling for rare atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons,
747520	754520	because I think the greatest danger at the moment is that fear of nuclear weapons is seen as out of vogue,
754520	759520	and we have to reacquaint our viscera with the danger in which we live.
759520	764520	I mean, I did the last interview with Professor Stephen Hawking before he sadly died,
764520	766520	and I asked him what's the biggest threat to mankind,
766520	769520	and he said when artificial intelligence learns to self-design,
769520	773520	the implication being that when it does, the first thing it would do
773520	779520	is probably conclude that humans are completely pointless and irrational and useless in many cases,
779520	781520	and they just get rid of us.
782520	785520	I don't think that's his best work.
787520	790520	Really? You're not as concerned?
791520	795520	Well, in the long run, I think that it's a huge concern,
795520	798520	but if you look at what large language models are
798520	804520	and how quickly humans have confused large language models for general intelligence,
804520	808520	it tells you that maybe more humans need to spend time coding
808520	813520	and understanding the transformer architecture which enabled this recent mini-revolution.
813520	819520	I mean, it's absolutely astounding, but mostly what these machines are doing are feeding us back to us,
819520	823520	and once they've read all our books and read all our papers,
823520	829520	it's easily possible that this model and this architecture may plateau.
829520	833520	But isn't it the same kind of situation with nuclear weapons
833520	841520	where in decent hands, supposedly decent hands of people who have a moral code,
841520	844520	a code of ethics who don't want to do the wrong thing,
844520	848520	nuclear weapons can be controlled and can be safe,
848520	854520	but in nefarious hands from people with evil intent, they become incredibly dangerous.
854520	857520	And I would say it's the same argument with AI, isn't it?
859520	863520	I don't agree with the premise, so maybe ask that to someone else.
863520	869520	I believe that if you take ten very moral people and very intelligent people
869520	872520	and you give them all nuclear weapons and the ability to annihilate each other,
872520	875520	you can play all sorts of game-theoretic experiments
875520	882520	and find that we're simply not wise enough to solve coordination problems and signaling problems.
882520	888520	I just don't agree with this idea that it's our morality and our intellect
888520	890520	which makes nuclear weapons dangerous.
890520	892520	It is simply the power.
892520	897520	It's like handing a lightsaber to somebody in a Star Wars film
897520	904520	and watching them learn by slicing off a leg and an arm within the first five minutes.
904520	907520	Hand somebody a pair of nunchucks.
907520	910520	They're most likely to knock themselves out rather than to become Bruce Lee.
910520	915520	Yeah, but if you have Mother Teresa with a finger on the nuclear button and Adolf Hitler,
915520	919520	the chances are more likely that it'll be the bad guy that presses it.
921520	928520	You took two people, one is much worse than the other, but those aren't my favorites.
928520	933520	Mother Teresa, we don't need to reliticate the Christopher Hitchens point.
933520	943520	I would say that I just don't know of these good people who can steward nuclear weapons.
943520	946520	It's simply too much power.
946520	949520	Or if you think about it in terms of systems,
949520	956520	a democracy is capable of having a string of 10 moral ethical leaders
956520	959520	and then it gets itself into a period of distress
959520	962520	and suddenly it elects somebody who's completely unfit for the office.
962520	967520	We don't have the ability to live with this amount of leverage.
967520	969520	I had a good relationship with Christopher Hitchens.
969520	973520	I employed him actually as a columnist when I was editor for Daily Mirror
973520	976520	and he once sent me one of my favorite emails ever, which was he said,
976520	983520	the four most overrated things in life were lobster, champagne, anal sex and picnics.
984520	992520	I don't really know much about champagne and some of the other items on your list
992520	995520	don't appeal to me for this conversation, perhaps the next question.
997520	1002520	One of your big thoughts is that western institutions, including politicians,
1002520	1006520	scientists and media, are actively lying to us
1006520	1011520	and we've seen this exacerbated by things like the pandemic,
1011520	1016520	like modern warfare and all the propaganda that flies around it.
1016520	1021520	How much of your belief that they're lying to us is driven by,
1021520	1025520	I guess, the social media element of this,
1025520	1030520	where everything is amplified in real time to the public in a way it never used to be.
1030520	1036520	In other words, information used to flow to us in a far slower and more controlled way
1036520	1040520	whereas now everything is coming out as 24-7 in real time.
1043520	1047520	Well, you know, I hold an unpopular view,
1047520	1054520	which is that public-spirited fictions are essential to proper governance.
1054520	1057520	The problem isn't that they're lying to us,
1057520	1063520	the problem is that the lies are not public-spirited, they are not competent,
1063520	1068520	they're not adult-level fictions and they're not minimal.
1068520	1070520	You want to lie as little as possible.
1070520	1074520	A French philosopher once said that a nation is a collection of people
1074520	1077520	that have agreed to forget something in common.
1077520	1081520	So in part, you know, if you were to resolve the contradictions,
1081520	1084520	let's say, in the United States First Amendment,
1084520	1088520	you might find that you had no constitution.
1088520	1091520	The problem is the nature of the lies
1091520	1095520	and they are not adult-level and I don't mean to boast on your program,
1095520	1098520	but I have an IQ above 40, so I find this really distressing
1098520	1105520	that I'm constantly asked to believe things that no child should be asked to believe.
1105520	1108520	I mean, you tweeted the other day about Ukraine and Putin.
1108520	1111520	I can't tell you my position on US strategy in Ukraine.
1111520	1114520	If I don't know more, all I know is that in a democracy,
1114520	1119520	I'm being lied to and pressured to support something I don't sufficiently understand.
1119520	1123520	That's it. I mean, you could take that argument in 1939
1123520	1125520	and say, you know, when Hitler invaded Poland,
1125520	1127520	I don't know enough about it.
1127520	1129520	I haven't been told enough about it by my government.
1129520	1133520	Therefore, I can't take a position about Adolf Hitler.
1133520	1138520	I would say that what Putin is doing in Ukraine is not dissimilar, actually,
1138520	1141520	and that his aspirations may not be quite as heinous
1141520	1145520	in terms of global domination as Hitler.
1145520	1148520	But I would say his aspirations are heinous.
1148520	1153520	And I'm always surprised when people with your kind of intellect
1153520	1157520	wrestle with any kind of quandary about Russian dictator
1157520	1161520	invading sovereign democratic country and murdering loads of people
1161520	1163520	and helping himself to loads of land
1163520	1167520	and why that shouldn't be in everyone's interest to repel.
1167520	1171520	Well, I would like to think that's because you misunderstand my position.
1171520	1175520	But it could be a failure of intellect on my part.
1175520	1180520	We're in a very long-running post-Cold War strategy
1180520	1187520	where in 1999, I believe we extended Article 5 NATO status to Poland,
1187520	1192520	which was not former Soviet Union but was Warsaw Pact.
1192520	1194520	I didn't have a problem at that point.
1194520	1199520	I think it was in 2004 where we extended Article 5 status
1199520	1201520	to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.
1201520	1207520	And at that point, I clearly felt that I didn't understand what we were doing.
1207520	1214520	I believe that, you know, Riga is within a thousand miles or kilometer,
1214520	1216520	I don't even know, of Moscow.
1216520	1221520	And, you know, because the Cuban Missile Crisis was very much top of mind
1221520	1225520	during the part of the Cold War that I saw and its aftermath,
1225520	1229520	I very well remember the concept of American spheres of influence.
1229520	1233520	The Cuba was not considered a sovereign nation that could choose to do whatever it wanted
1233520	1235520	because it was simply too close to the United States.
1235520	1243520	I think that, in part, it's the desire to only put on one pair of glasses,
1243520	1245520	one set of lenses.
1245520	1251520	The sovereign nation lens clearly suggests that Putin is a madman
1251520	1257520	and his crossing of the border of Ukraine, it's a slam dunk.
1257520	1260520	So, it's not that I don't understand your point,
1260520	1264520	but then, again, there's another set of glasses, which is the spheres of influence glasses.
1264520	1270520	And that says that, in fact, powerful nations like Russia have concerns
1270520	1273520	that don't have to do only with their exact borders.
1273520	1277520	And if you look, for example, at a time lapse of the borders in central-eastern Europe,
1277520	1280520	you'll notice that they've been fluid for forever.
1280520	1285520	If every time there is a border readjustment, we go to the brink of nuclear war,
1285520	1287520	that's game over.
1287520	1292520	Furthermore, there are very complicated relations in central and eastern Europe.
1292520	1298520	And I don't think that Americans are particularly adept at discussing them,
1298520	1304520	forcing us to say Slava Ukraine as a slogan.
1304520	1309520	We're not allowed to say glory to anything, but we're supposed to be 100% on board.
1309520	1314520	This is a long-running, statecraft-level narrative.
1314520	1319520	Clearly, there was an idea in place as far back as the fall of the Berlin Wall.
1319520	1321520	I don't understand what the strategy is.
1321520	1323520	It might be the right strategy.
1323520	1328520	I'm certainly not supporting Putin, who's an absolute brutal thug.
1328520	1329520	That's not in question.
1329520	1334520	The problem is, is that we are now the stewards of a thermonuclear planet.
1334520	1341520	And the simple application of an idea that he crossed the border of a sovereign nation
1341520	1345520	after everything we've been doing in Ukraine and all the games that we've played,
1345520	1348520	I don't think that this really makes sense.
1348520	1355520	And the problem, as I understand it, is that we keep telling the audience, the electorate, if you will,
1355520	1360520	that these incredibly simplistic lenses with which we choose to view everything
1360520	1363520	are sufficient to actually form grown-up opinions, and they aren't.
1363520	1369520	I mean, the irony, of course, is that if Ukraine had not been encouraged to give up its nuclear defence,
1369520	1375520	then Putin is highly unlikely to have invaded it.
1375520	1383520	There are so many choices that we have made in terms of how we've handled the post-Cold War
1383520	1388520	former Soviet Union countries and Warsaw Pact countries.
1388520	1393520	I think you have to understand that this is part of a long-running grand strategy,
1393520	1396520	and it's not shared with me.
1396520	1404520	I'm not even positive that today's State Department officials are really 100% in...
1404520	1408520	that they have good knowledge of what this extended plan is.
1408520	1412520	Very often what you find is that the architects of a multi-decade plan die
1412520	1416520	and they don't teach their successors what the actual strategy was.
1416520	1421520	When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, did you think it was right
1421520	1429520	that American boots were put on the ground to kick him out, given it wasn't a NATO country?
1429520	1435520	Kuwait, in some sense, is in part created as a block
1435520	1442520	so that Iraq would have the tiniest sea front.
1442520	1451520	The creation, in some sense, of states by colonial powers or accidents of history...
1451520	1457520	I think the problem here is that Saddam Hussein was an absolute brute,
1457520	1462520	but he was a brute in a region in which one has to become brutish.
1462520	1467520	It is astounding the extent to which many Iraqis who were relatively middle class
1467520	1473520	and knew the difficulties of governing in that region viewed him as an absolute brute,
1473520	1478520	but were appreciative of his efforts of keeping Iraq relatively secular.
1478520	1482520	That's not to say that I'm a Saddam Hussein supporter far from it.
1482520	1488520	It's just to say that we keep communicating very strange things into these regions.
1488520	1495520	For example, when I think it was George Herbert Walker Bush who told the Marsh Arabs in the south of Iraq
1495520	1500520	and then got them slaughtered, we have to be very careful in our communications
1500520	1504520	in incredibly different regions from our own.
1504520	1511520	Do you think it's really in America's national interest that Vladimir Putin could win in Ukraine,
1511520	1520520	could just seize a vast chunk of that country and claim it as Russian, as he did with Crimea
1520520	1523520	and it's, of course, after he voted Georgia as well?
1523520	1528520	Do you think it's in America's national interest that a Russian dictator expands the power
1528520	1533520	and geographical land of Russia?
1533520	1542520	No. No, no, no. I very much don't want Vladimir Putin to taste victory.
1542520	1546520	I don't want him to try to reassemble the former Soviet Union.
1546520	1549520	So how do you stop him?
1549520	1554520	Well, in part, you might want to cooperate.
1554520	1563520	You might have wanted to have cooperated with him more and it's very difficult.
1563520	1567520	Look, my family comes from the region.
1567520	1574520	Almost 100% of my ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Ukraine and Latvia.
1575520	1580520	I'm very hesitant to talk in Western media about the realities of the region
1580520	1586520	because I don't think that Americans have been prepared for quite what the pressures are in this area
1586520	1592520	and it is incredibly important that we understand just how dangerous this region is,
1592520	1594520	in part because of the skill level of the players.
1594520	1600520	Vladimir Putin may be a brute, a butcher, but he's also incredibly skilled.
1600520	1607520	You have to remember that America's nuclear power effectively came from a bunch of emigres from places like Lvov,
1607520	1613520	which is now called Lviv, which I think it was a Polish city, which is now claimed to be Ukrainian.
1613520	1621520	We have to appreciate that this is a region that is incredibly skilled, incredibly dangerous,
1621520	1628520	a source of intellectual horsepower which built America's own atomic arsenal, refugees from the area.
1628520	1633520	So I think that you just have to understand that most of us are way out of our depths
1633520	1640520	if we don't have great information, we don't have cultural and historical understanding of the tensions between these people.
1640520	1644520	I want to just change tack to free speech.
1644520	1649520	In your estimation, are there any limits to free speech?
1649520	1656520	Well, it depends. People say free markets and there are all sorts of limits on free markets.
1656520	1661520	Usually when we say free speech, adults know the limits. You know that there are libel limits.
1661520	1668520	There's Brandenburg versus Ohio. There are all sorts of things that you can't say or do.
1668520	1677520	We have export controls. In fact, in physics, there's a concept called restricted data
1677520	1682520	where if you have an idea and you're not a federal employee and you don't have a security clearance,
1682520	1691520	if the idea touches nuclear weapons, you may not share it at all because it is born secret.
1691520	1695520	There are huge limits on speech that are part of free speech.
1695520	1703520	So when we say free speech, I'm 100% for free speech, but that is an understanding that that's a reserved term of art.
1703520	1710520	It's not unrestricted speech. It has never been. It can't exist as such.
1710520	1716520	You and I think are both big fans of Elon Musk. I had an interview with him at the start of the year
1716520	1723520	which he unceremoniously cancelled when he found a clip of me on the show mildly criticising his decision
1723520	1728520	to let Alex Jones back onto X having previously said he would never let him back on
1728520	1733520	and he wouldn't let people who stand on the graves of dead children on the platform.
1733520	1737520	I thought he was wrong to change his mind about Alex Jones, but I found it quite ironic
1737520	1746520	that Elon, who is a constant promoter of free speech, particularly on X, would not want to engage in an interview with me
1746520	1750520	because I criticised him over something like that.
1750520	1756520	Well, you know, everyone wants to date free speech, but when free speech wants to date other people,
1756520	1763520	we always have second thoughts and I'd like to think that I'm at least self-aware enough to realise
1763520	1771520	that most of the things that we stand up for, truth, ethics, free speech, etc., when they bind on us,
1771520	1776520	we as humans are very likely to change our mind. That's why we try to enshrine this in law.
1776520	1782520	It's sort of a Ulysses contract that I know that I'm going to be against free speech when it's used in a way that I don't like.
1782520	1788520	I bristled when you said you read my Wikipedia entry because I have idiots who constantly try to deface it.
1789520	1793520	On the other hand, because I'm locked into a free speech mentality,
1793520	1798520	it stays my hand when I try to say that that's something that shouldn't be permitted.
1798520	1805520	Effectively, I have to put up with the empowerment of idiots and dangerous ones at that
1805520	1809520	if I'm really signed up for the free speech project and, you know, there you have it.
1809520	1813520	It was interesting on Wikipedia. I mean, my eldest son noticed, I don't know if you know if it's still there,
1813520	1817520	if I never look at it, but it said that I was the youngest of four children
1817520	1822520	and I happened to be the oldest of four children. So it's a tiny little fact.
1822520	1825520	It doesn't matter to anybody other than it's wrong.
1825520	1828520	So my eldest son as a journalist corrected it.
1828520	1832520	And then whoever it was who put the erroneous information up there,
1832520	1837520	re-corrected it back to the false one. And this went on and on and on and on,
1837520	1839520	and there was no end to it.
1839520	1842520	Where my eldest son kept saying I was the eldest.
1842520	1846520	And whoever this person was kept saying I was the youngest.
1846520	1851520	And all it showed me was that Wikipedia professes to be, you know,
1851520	1857520	a great vehicle for information, accurate information about people and so on and free speech and so on.
1857520	1862520	But there's not much it can do if someone is utterly determined to put disinformation out there.
1862520	1865520	Well, it was briefly a great resource.
1865520	1869520	The problem that we find is it had certain flaws.
1869520	1872520	When you had rules about, you know, authoritative sources,
1872520	1876520	and sources were in fact largely authoritative, it worked well.
1876520	1881520	As you've seen the degradation of authoritative sources and as people become more sophisticated
1881520	1886520	about what kinds of exploits work on Wikipedia, you have a very dangerous situation,
1886520	1890520	which is that technical articles continue to be of fairly high quality
1890520	1894520	because there's no one determined to graffiti over them.
1894520	1902520	However, when you start including political people or people who are disliked by someone,
1902520	1910520	the incentives change and as a result what you see is a sort of a chimeric resource,
1910520	1915520	which is very high quality if it was going to describe hydraulic presses, let's say,
1915520	1921520	but very low quality when you have a controversial figure who's hated by a determined group.
1921520	1926520	So I think that it has morphed over our lifetime from being something
1926520	1932520	which is an astonishing achievement to something which is in fact very dangerous.
1932520	1938520	The other thing I would say is that we have a very strange situation
1938520	1944520	in that we expected that free speech was going to be the exchange of ideas with which we disagreed.
1944520	1952520	And instead it has morphed, I think, over my lifetime much more into a question of what can I get away with
1952520	1957520	that might not be true, it might not be a different point of view,
1957520	1962520	but it's simply a free speech exploit to destroy.
1962520	1964520	If I don't have a good argument against somebody's position,
1964520	1970520	I always have the ability to try to talk about that person's family or skin care or what have you.
1970520	1975520	And I think that for many of us we're sort of waking up to the idea
1975520	1980520	that a world saturated in speech without friction, which is what we now have,
1980520	1985520	you don't have to print a pamphlet or get a book deal in order to say your piece,
1985520	1993520	that in a cacophonous world, mostly what free speech produces is vitriol and personal attacks.
1993520	1998520	And I think that we're all sort of scratching our head, this isn't exactly the future that we had envisaged.
1998520	2003520	On the COVID pandemic, which we touched on earlier,
2003520	2008520	your brother Brett has become a very high profile part of this debate.
2008520	2011520	We've got a clip of him talking about it, listen to this.
2011520	2016520	I believe we must zoom out if we are to understand the pattern that we are gathered here to explore,
2016520	2021520	because the pattern is larger than federal health agencies and the COVID cartel.
2021520	2027520	If we do zoom out and ask what are they hiding, the answer becomes as obvious as it is disturbing.
2027520	2030520	They are hiding everything.
2030520	2033520	So that was to a Senate committee this week.
2033520	2036520	What did you make of your brother's appearance there?
2036520	2041520	What do you make of the general debate about COVID as it raged in real time?
2041520	2048520	Well, first of all, I want to be very clear that whatever Brett's positions are on COVID are his positions.
2048520	2053520	They are not my positions, and I don't want to be referenced to his positions.
2053520	2064520	Much of what he says is true, but the problem is that when you are so clearly lying about the origins of COVID,
2064520	2070520	its treatment, the reasons for doing things, the science, you open up the question,
2070520	2074520	what exactly is going on and why are we lying about everything?
2075520	2083520	I think the stark difference is that Brett claims that he can figure out much more of that story than I think I can,
2083520	2086520	and I daresay I don't think anyone can.
2086520	2094520	If you're not going to really go after the EcoHealth Alliance and Peter Dajik in terms of the information
2094520	2101520	that that organization and that individual holds, and you're not going to discuss Ralph Berwick's lab in North Carolina,
2101520	2106520	you're not going to talk about the private communications inside of NIH with Francis Collins.
2106520	2116520	If you're not going to talk about Anthony Fauci's duties in terms of biowarfare after the Geneva and biowarfare conventions of the 1970s,
2116520	2123520	because presumably this is all about statecraft and the extremely secret programs as to why are we in Wuhan,
2124520	2129520	talking about inserting, if you're in Cleveland sites and humanizing coronavirus,
2130520	2138520	it's an absolutely terrifying vacuum of knowledge, and I don't think we know why.
2138520	2146520	I think that this, very likely, we're trying to play 12-dimensional chess and we're barely able to play checkers,
2146520	2152520	and this goes back to the original point about, I think it was April of 1953 when we figured out DNA,
2152520	2156520	and then 10 years later we had the genetic code with the work of Marshall Nirenberg.
2156520	2163520	It's so much power, and the treaties that we've signed are possibly nonsensical.
2163520	2167520	I mean, we have a problem that we don't develop offensive weapons,
2167520	2172520	but defensive measures can be easily converted to offensive measures.
2172520	2178520	We have put restrictions on ourselves that we then attempt to get out of.
2178520	2185520	Almost certainly this has to do with questions that we don't want resolved in public,
2185520	2189520	and I came from, you know, I'm an old man now.
2189520	2197520	At 58, I remember the church hearings, the pike hearings, the Watergate hearings, the Iran-Contra hearings.
2197520	2205520	We have given up on a taste for actually figuring out who we are, what we've done, what our responsibilities are,
2205520	2210520	and I think that we don't know. Brett may know. I don't think he does.
2210520	2215520	I know that I don't know, and the hearings were the way that we were going to figure this out,
2215520	2219520	and I don't think that we did that in a smart and aggressive fashion.
2219520	2224520	How do you think the pandemic began?
2224520	2228520	I don't know. It could be a wet market. It's very unlikely.
2228520	2235520	I think that the diffuse proposal that came out of the EcoHealth Alliance clearly suggests
2235520	2239520	that there's a whole lot of coincidence that was going on in Wuhan, China,
2239520	2245520	but I have to say that, you know, as somebody with a STEM PhD,
2245520	2250520	I'd like to restrict myself first to what I can say,
2250520	2253520	and what I can say is we're not trying to figure it out.
2253520	2260520	I can also say with absolute certainty that the claim coming out of places like the Lancet,
2260520	2269520	that any attempt to figure out the origin of COVID that considered the Wuhan Institute of Virology was necessarily racist,
2269520	2278520	was an abomination, the attempt to sign up Nobel laureates in order to make this seem like a respectable position.
2278520	2283520	What was it, like 60-plus Nobel laureates?
2283520	2286520	This is a great danger to science.
2286520	2297520	We cannot spend our credibility covering up for failures of statecraft and 12D chess at a geopolitical level.
2297520	2300520	I think we have to go back to a world in which we actually get answers,
2300520	2306520	and if we killed a bunch of people by helping the Chinese in their biological laboratories,
2306520	2313520	we're going to have to take responsibility that potentially tens of millions of people are dead through our stupidity.
2313520	2318520	During the pandemic, the science regularly changed as facts changed.
2318520	2323520	That struck me looking back on it as a perfectly normal sequence of events,
2323520	2327520	with a novel virus that that would happen.
2328520	2334520	I mean, are you sympathetic to the issues that scientists had
2334520	2337520	and to the fact that they did keep changing their mind about things,
2337520	2343520	from the efficacy of masks, for example, to whether if you had a vaccine you could transmit the virus and so on?
2343520	2349520	Are you sympathetic to that's the fog of war when you're dealing with something like that?
2349520	2351520	No.
2352520	2358520	Really? You think it was willful, deliberate disinformation, knowing the facts?
2358520	2366520	Look, I'm not a biologist, but again, that above 40 IQ keeps causing me problems.
2366520	2370520	This was obviously two separate things.
2370520	2375520	A small amount of revision in terms of our knowledge as we learned more
2375520	2381520	and a massive amount of revisions as our policy changed.
2381520	2387520	If you expended too much PPE personal protective equipment in a previous administration
2387520	2391520	and then you failed to follow the administrations of the literature,
2391520	2395520	which said that you had to be prepared for surges,
2395520	2400520	very sudden needs for a very large amount of PPE, for example.
2400520	2405520	It was very clear that we were being told that masks didn't work at the beginning in part
2405520	2410520	because we were trying to reserve them for people who were working in emergency rooms.
2410520	2417520	And then we decided that we needed these masks despite questions about the size of the virus
2417520	2421520	and the width of the mesh of the mask.
2421520	2424520	And then we go back and forth and back and forth.
2424520	2431520	This is a transparent situation in which we're pretending that our reasons for doing something
2431520	2434520	are given by some proxy.
2434520	2441520	I think that what we had was we didn't want to admit that we'd failed to replenish our stock under Obama.
2441520	2446520	I think we didn't want to admit that the masks weren't necessarily very efficacious.
2446520	2453520	We didn't really have great tools, and as such, we just looked like idiots.
2453520	2455520	And we couldn't ask questions, right?
2455520	2462520	If you look at, for example, the PhDs who are outside of the control of the university system
2462520	2467520	who weren't dependent on NIH grants, who are free, effectively, to ask questions,
2467520	2473520	we were supposed to be the representatives of ordinary Americans who wanted answers to these questions.
2473520	2475520	And we were all denigrated.
2475520	2481520	We were told that we were, I don't know, crazy people, conspiracy theorists, et cetera, et cetera.
2481520	2488520	You look at the trajectory of Jeffrey Sachs, who was put on this commission to investigate these things.
2488520	2491520	He appointed all of these people from inside the system,
2491520	2499520	and he realized that he'd hired wolves and foxes to guard hen houses.
2499520	2501520	This is a crazy situation.
2501520	2508520	We need to give our scientists FU money, and we need them to tell us the truth.
2508520	2510520	And I don't think it was that the science was changing.
2510520	2515520	I think that the idea is something terrible happened, and we weren't honest about it.
2515520	2520520	You have been called the new Einstein because you love maths and physics,
2520520	2522520	but also because you had the theory of relativity.
2522520	2525520	You have a theory of everything.
2525520	2532520	It's complex, the theory of everything, but what's the simple layman version of it?
2532520	2537520	The Einstein was, well, first of all, I mean, it's a very kind introduction.
2537520	2539520	I'm happy to just be myself.
2539520	2544520	Effectively, that you're looking at something that's extraordinarily simple,
2544520	2548520	that Einstein's theory, if you will, began with four degrees of freedom,
2548520	2551520	which you can think of as any four degrees of freedom,
2551520	2554520	like treble, mid, bass, and reverb on an amp.
2554520	2558520	Then what he did was he took the four degrees of freedom,
2558520	2563520	and he said, let's put three rulers and one watch as measuring devices
2563520	2569520	and six protractors to measure the angles between all of those four objects.
2569520	2572520	And he called that spacetime.
2572520	2577520	That spacetime object is not where I believe we live.
2577520	2584520	We actually live on top of all of those extra rulers, watches, and protractors,
2584520	2587520	and we are played back in this four-dimensional space.
2587520	2590520	So imagine that you have a record on a phonograph.
2590520	2594520	Imagine that that record was, in some sense, 14-dimensional data.
2594520	2598520	The stylus was Einstein's spacetime metric,
2598520	2602520	and the gramophone is the four-dimensional world that you perceive.
2602520	2605520	That is, in essence, where I believe we are.
2605520	2610520	I believe that we are looking at a 14-dimensional world.
2610520	2613520	Effectively, you think you're living in four dimensions,
2613520	2618520	but you're playing back a 14-dimensional world via Einstein's metric,
2618520	2619520	and you're getting confused.
2619520	2624520	How is it that you have Schrodinger's cat both dead and alive?
2624520	2627520	Well, how is it that on the door's first album,
2627520	2630520	you have both break on through to the other side and light my fire,
2630520	2632520	but you don't hear them both at once?
2632520	2634520	You don't think of that as a paradox,
2634520	2640520	and I think that in part we have all of these crazy logjams
2640520	2643520	because we think we're living in a four-dimensional manifold.
2643520	2647520	So for people who are scientifically illiterate like me,
2647520	2650520	what is your plan to resolve this?
2653520	2658520	Sooner or later, the string theorists will retire and die,
2658520	2663520	and my desire is to outlive them.
2663520	2667520	Effectively, what you have is one group of very brilliant,
2667520	2672520	very smart people who refuse to follow scientific ethics.
2672520	2674520	They won't consider other people's work.
2674520	2676520	They name everything after themselves.
2676520	2680520	They absorb everything into their worldview,
2680520	2682520	and they've made science impossible
2682520	2685520	much the way biology was made impossible under COVID.
2685520	2689520	And what I thought I would do is I'd start a podcast.
2689520	2690520	I'd grow an enormous channel.
2690520	2694520	I think I'm the mathematician with the largest following in the world.
2694520	2698520	And the entire point of that is to make sure
2698520	2700520	that they can't do to me what they did to me before,
2700520	2704520	which is to drown me out and use the official channels.
2704520	2705520	So I'll use the unofficial channels.
2705520	2709520	In fact, the Intellectual Dark Web came about because I'd spotted
2709520	2714520	that podcasts were far more powerful than anyone in traditional media had thought.
2714520	2719520	And so what I did was I tried to aggregate a few people with mega channels
2719520	2721520	and a lot of voices that needed amplification
2721520	2725520	and wrap a kind of a concept or a brand around it.
2725520	2729520	Right now, the legacy media doesn't know why it's dying.
2729520	2734520	And what I intend to do is to use a large channel
2734520	2736520	to become even larger.
2736520	2738520	And apparently I jumped the gun a little bit.
2738520	2744520	I think that unfortunately this university system that holds back new ideas,
2744520	2749520	and I mean scientific ideas, and it is still too powerful.
2749520	2753520	This thing that we just saw with Claudine Gay, however, is a huge,
2753520	2756520	I don't know, it's a huge window of hope that's opening,
2756520	2760520	because if I had told you before that the president of Harvard
2760520	2763520	was completely unqualified for that office
2763520	2766520	and that that person might be a plagiarist,
2766520	2769520	that might have sounded completely fanciful.
2769520	2771520	You might have thought I was crazy.
2771520	2774520	Well, the fact that she lost her job for it
2774520	2777520	actually would have sounded crazy, because you would have thought that...
2777520	2781520	No, no, no, she still employed as a professor.
2781520	2784520	Right, but she lost her job as the president of Harvard, right?
2784520	2787520	Absolutely, but what I'm trying to say is
2787520	2793520	when you find out how corrupt our universities are
2793520	2798520	and how much amazing work is still being done within them,
2798520	2802520	you'll be ready to listen to Geometric Unity, but you're not there yet.
2802520	2806520	Right now you're in the process of figuring out that Harvard isn't Harvard,
2806520	2811520	MIT isn't MIT, and I sure hope that Oxford and Cambridge are still themselves.
2811520	2814520	They have a little bit, a little longer in the tooth
2814520	2816520	and maybe a little bit more history under their belt,
2816520	2818520	but right now it's important to purge the universities
2818520	2823520	of everything related to diversity, equity, inclusion, plagiarism.
2823520	2826520	We need to get rid of a lot of these activist subjects
2826520	2830520	that were maybe founded with the best of intentions in the late 60s,
2830520	2832520	and we need to return to rigorous scholarship
2832520	2835520	and above all collegiality with enough money
2835520	2840520	that professors do not fear if they don't sign a loyalty oath.
2840520	2842520	They don't need to worry about walking to campus
2842520	2845520	that they're going to be, you know, attacked.
2845520	2849520	Right now what we need is something like a civil war in the universities
2849520	2851520	and the right side has to win.
2851520	2855520	You know, I realized we'd reached an absolute nadir with this
2855520	2858520	when a professor at an American university, I can't remember which one,
2858520	2863520	for 25 years had delivered a lecture about the use of offensive language
2863520	2866520	in modern society and as part of the lecture
2866520	2869520	he used examples of offensive language
2869520	2873520	and he was reported by students who couldn't handle this
2873520	2876520	and were triggered by it for using offensive language
2876520	2879520	and he was fired, even though the whole point of his lecture
2879520	2881520	for a quarter of a century had been
2881520	2884520	how you navigate the use of offensive language in society.
2884520	2888520	And at that point I realized we had literally lost our minds.
2888520	2890520	I mean, the idea that a university professor
2890520	2894520	would be hounded out of his job for giving a lecture about a subject
2894520	2900520	where the students had just willfully, deliberately misused
2900520	2903520	the use of the offensive language to get him out of his job
2903520	2906520	seemed to me extraordinary.
2909520	2912520	University is not kindergarten.
2912520	2919520	It is important to become intolerant of people who are not tolerant themselves.
2919520	2921520	That will sound like a paradox to some.
2921520	2923520	We have no time for that.
2923520	2928520	It is very important to restore collegiality, academic freedom, freedom of speech
2928520	2931520	and a lot of people don't belong in university
2931520	2936520	and we need to practice exclusion rather than inclusion in their case.
2936520	2938520	I don't know how to say this.
2938520	2942520	This idea, this vogue that we have for things that sound good but make no sense
2942520	2945520	has to be purged from the system by the adults.
2945520	2947520	Otherwise there will be no adults in the system.
2947520	2950520	I want to end very quickly, Eric.
2950520	2952520	I've got ten things.
2952520	2956520	I want to give you the opportunity to give me a statistical probability
2956520	2958520	of these things happening.
2958520	2960520	So you can choose any percentage you like, okay?
2960520	2962520	But you've got to answer quickly. It's rapid fire.
2962520	2964520	No, no, no. Yeah, I decline.
2964520	2966520	You can't do that?
2966520	2967520	No.
2967520	2968520	Really? Why?
2968520	2971520	Because it's going to be extremely low quality.
2971520	2975520	I live on the internet and as, no, I'm quite serious.
2975520	2979520	There's a vogue for trying to get people to answer all questions.
2979520	2983520	I didn't particularly want to answer a question about my brother's views on COVID
2983520	2984520	because why?
2984520	2988520	I completely supported him with respect to Ivermectin
2988520	2991520	and the idea it wasn't horse to warmer,
2991520	2995520	but I completely disagreed with his Ivermectin maximalism.
2995520	2998520	And the internet can't maintain a distinction like that, you see.
2998520	3001520	In other words, to the Ivermectin army,
3001520	3006520	Brett was a genius for realizing that Ivermectin was a near perfect prophylactic,
3006520	3008520	which I didn't believe.
3008520	3011520	On the other hand, to people who were buying the official line,
3011520	3016520	I was killing people by suggesting that Ivermectin was a replacement.
3016520	3020520	So every time you ask a person to engage in such activities,
3020520	3024520	what happens is that that person's life turns to crap
3024520	3026520	because of the low quality people on the internet,
3026520	3029520	many of whom are bots probably, not even humans,
3029520	3031520	that dog you with everything that you say.
3031520	3034520	So the reason that I don't accept what you're saying
3034520	3037520	is that I don't want three weeks of pain in my life
3037520	3040520	that I'm an idiot for giving those probabilities.
3041520	3044520	That's actually a brilliant answer.
3044520	3046520	Eric Weinstein, it's been a pleasure talking to you.
3046520	3047520	Thank you very much.
3047520	3049520	I really enjoyed it, Pierce. Thanks for having me.
3049520	3050520	Thank you.
