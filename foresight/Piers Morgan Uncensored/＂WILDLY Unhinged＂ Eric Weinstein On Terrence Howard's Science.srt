1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Everything has an equal and opposite.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,000
It has to mate.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Whoa.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're kind of adding legitimacy to young hinged science fiction.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I wouldn't have been able to appear with Terrence

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The platform to be accepted for the ideas is not social media.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Neil himself doesn't appear conversant in the history of science and reviewing.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's ten times easier to produce something that's BS,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and so then it is to refute it.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Science has a branding problem.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
you have all already lost.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Science has become a pagan faith.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Trust the science became a mantra during the COVID pandemic,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but in the years since, and partly as a consequence,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
a rising tide of people are doing quite the opposite.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Challenging the scientific mainstream is in vogue.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Nobody's this better illustrated than the recent viral phenomenon

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
of actor Terrence Howard on the Joe Rogan podcast,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the biggest media platform in the world right now,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
arguing that one times one actually equals two,

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
among other bizarre theories.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They don't show that hydrogen has the same tone as carbon.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What do you mean by tone?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Same tone, same QV.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You keep dividing light by two,

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and you'll ultimately get back to the audible sound of it,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
because there was a relationship between light and color,

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
sound and tone, matter and shape.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
At a given point, Mars was here in the Goldilocks zone.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Everything has an equal and opposite.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It has to mate.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Mating is a big part of what we do.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The boron mates with nitrogen,

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and that's how the carbon happens.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
96% of physics is unknown matter,

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that they've had to make up to account for it,

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and we were able to build Saturn.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Man, don't turn my phone off, don't do that.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Every time I get ready,

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
well, because I know they're watching me right now,

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and they're mad at me.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Whose day?

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The politicians and the authorities

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that give their politicians their accreditation.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And our world economy is based off of one times one equaling.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you think they fuck with your phone?

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, I'm sure of it.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, there were four hours of that,

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but it's reached tens of millions of people.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's been a true viral phenomenon, like I said.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, many in the scientific establishment expressed alarm

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
at the apparently limitless reach of wild theories

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
at a time science has a reputation problem.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Professor Neil deGrasse Tyson,

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the most famous scientist on the planet,

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
had this to say.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It is not my podcast.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It is research journals where attention can be given

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
on a level that at the end of the day

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
offers no higher respect for your energy and intellect

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
than by declaring that what's in it is either right or wrong

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or worthy of publication or not.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, others disagree.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They argue the old system needs to be shaken up.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The questioning and challenging mainstream institutions

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and theories is the only real way to actually get to the truth.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Here to debate this, the podcast and cosmologist

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
at University of California, Professor Brian Keating,

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
host of Impact Theory, Tom Billier,

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but I'll start with Dr. Eric Weinstein,

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
mathematician and OG of the Intellectual Dark Web

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and creator of the Portal podcast.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, Eric, welcome back to Uncensored.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Really fascinating to see how big this has all blown

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
in the last few days.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
For those who didn't watch the Terrence Howard four-hour,

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know what you would call it,

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
theory-a-thon, let's be kind.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What were the sort of main premises he was coming out with

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
that have captured everyone's attention?

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, I think that the...

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
he made several outrageous claims

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that were more or less baseless

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
as far as either the heterodox

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
or the orthodox view of science,

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that one times one is equal to two,

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that the periodic table should be rearranged

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
around earlier work from the 1920s,

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
that he had a theory of physics

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
based on platonic solids with curved linear sides.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't think any of those hold up to any kind of scrutiny.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That said, he definitely has some very interesting engineering claims

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and he's got some very interesting geometric structures

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that could make beautiful lighting, fantastic art,

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and he is saying some things that people are deriding

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
from a scholarly perspective

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
that actually have some merit.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's a very bizarre and complicated situation,

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
but it is not complicated at the root.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There's nothing wrong with standard orthodox science

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and I say that as a very strong critic of the system.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you wanted to hear it from somebody with a PhD

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
who's nevertheless not shy about savaging the institutions

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
when that is what they deserve,

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I would say that the level of doubt that he has cast

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
on simple things like arithmetic is completely unwarranted,

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
but it's a very bizarre situation to watch an entire nation

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that depends on technology and science for its advantage

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
suddenly question whether or not one times one equals one.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What is fascinating to me is the last time

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I had him to do a Terence Howard,

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I interviewed him at CNN about 10 years ago

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
when he did a movie about the Tuskegee Airmen,

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and the next thing, he's doing a four-hour podcast with Joe Rogan

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
in which he's airing the most sort of intensely complex theories,

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
many of which, as you say, might be completely for the birds.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Were you aware that Terence Howard was thinking this way,

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
was moving to a place where he could even conduct an interview like that?

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, to be honest, I didn't know who Terence Howard was,

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
so I didn't have an image for him,

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
but had you asked me, I would have thought back to Werner Herzog

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
doing the entire film Fitz Corraldo to test his engineering theories

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
about how less technologically advanced people could move heavy objects

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
many miles up hills.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He created an entire film to test his engineering theories.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hedy Lamar famously developed spread-spectrum technology,

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
despite being a screen siren back in the 30s and 40s,

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
so just as I don't think it's very strange to find out

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that Steve Martin is an incredible banjo player,

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't find it at all odd that a polymath like Terence Howard

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
would have such theories.

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think that the theories about math and physics and chemistry

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
are incredibly deep, so I'm going to push back on that.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I do think that he knows quite a lot about many things

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and he doesn't know what he doesn't know.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Neil DeCrasse Tyson said that people can know enough

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
to ask questions and stuff, but maybe not enough to know when they're wrong.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
In other words, when they're presented with quite complex science

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
that has been peer-reviewed and is deemed to be established scientific fact,

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that he doesn't know enough about the detail to understand why he's wrong to question it.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You mean the Dunning-Kruger effect, as Neil said.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's kind of ironic, actually, because it feels to me like Neil DeCrasse Tyson

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
is himself a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect when it comes to peer-review

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
as his comments about Sir Arthur Eddington using the 1919 total solar eclipse

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to prove that Einstein's theory about a star warping space,

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
in particular our sun, appeared to be born out.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Neil claims that that was sent to a peer-reviewed journal,

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
whereas peer-review doesn't really begin in physics.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And in the sciences, really, until the 60s and much more the 70s.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So it's very interesting because Neil himself doesn't appear

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
conversant in the history of science and reviewing.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Isn't the reality of all science a bit like with medicine,

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
that a lot of very smart people take a look at a lot of available data

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
but maybe not enough to reach absolute definitive conclusions,

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and they espouse theories which their peer group then look at

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and discuss and analyze and argue about.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And that's how we progress with science over decades, centuries and so on.

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Isn't this part of the evolution of science,

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is that people like you and Neil DeCrasse Tyson might vehemently disagree about stuff,

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but actually it's only through the disagreements you develop.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, but I doubt that he would agree to a program

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
where we were going to have a discussion about this.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
My guess is that you reached out to him and that he was too busy to appear.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
My claim is that in general we avoid dust-ups for fear of looking foolish.

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I think it's fine to avoid dust-ups when you feel that there's an ethical problem

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
with the other person.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
In general, science progresses by a large variety of different channels.

173
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Benjamin Jesty famously observed that his milkmaids weren't dying from smallpox,

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but they did get cowpox.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So he injected his entire family with cow pus to give them cowpox to prevent against smallpox.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's one of the beginnings of vaccines.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
People would dig up bodies from graveyards to do anatomical studies.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Famously, the ulcer, which was thought to be correlated with stress,

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
was tested by the dissenting heterodox biomedical researcher

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and shown to have a completely different etiology by using himself as a guinea pig.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think that you have to understand that just as Benjamin Franklin took a kite and key

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
into an electrical storm to prove that lightning was electricity,

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
people have done all sorts of things that have nothing to do with learned societies

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and the genteel sort of feel afforded by peer review in order to advance science.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I really think that in part what we've done is we've sanitized our own history

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and we've forgotten what works.

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What was interesting to me was Neil deGrasse Tyson didn't go on Joe Rogan to respond,

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
which is what Terrence Howard wanted him to do.

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But you did, and here's a clip from that.

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is the other side of it.

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is what was very interesting.

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Like these, they'll come together and meet.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can see where they meet up.

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They're natural meeting up.

195
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Now this one looks exactly like this one, but they don't have the same mixture.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So what this is creating, this is actually showing, this is the equal and opposite.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is matter, this becomes the anti-matter of it.

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I can't stop you doing that.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can't stop me.

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm so sorry.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm my own worst enemy and my own best friend.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You know what?

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That was a beautiful statement.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But what I'm trying to say is the fact that they keep, and these four will keep,

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
this is just the magnetic, what I consider the magnetic field.

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You see, you stopped yourself.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I consider this to be the magnetic field because they're expanding at the center

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and magnetism in my language, magnetism expands out and becomes greater.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And you know what you just said, in my language?

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In my language.

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's what I just did with the Terrence product.

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
In other words, I'm trying to get you to stop pissing my community off.

213
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't want to piss them off.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want friends.

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I need friends.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now the interesting thing to me is, as we would say in the UK, it sounded to me like

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
he was talking a load of old cobblers.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And yet you were there and you were being very generous and sort of reasonable and

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
decent with him and allowing him to continue with his theories.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's attracted for you a lot of criticism that by engaging in that manner with him,

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you're kind of adding legitimacy to slightly unhinged science fiction rather than promoting

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
the cause of science.

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How do you respond to that?

224
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
First of all, this is always a scuttlebutt and people say, so I'm not very impressed

225
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
with that.

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I would say that you have, I wouldn't say it's mildly unhinged.

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I would say it's wildly unhinged.

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
A lot of this stuff is just nonsense.

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
On the other hand, I was very quick to spot something that I wouldn't have been able to

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
appear with Terrence if I didn't think there was something in what he was doing.

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And because I have a lot of background and experience in this area, it was possible for

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
me to go through what he said at a speed that I think very few people would be able to go

233
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
through his work.

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, what percentage of what he was saying was true or at least vaguely sensible and

235
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
what was completely...

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Very little.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Right, so my question, if it was genuinely very little, him getting tens of millions of

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
views for espousing complete nonsense in the main.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And then someone with your pedigree and your knowledge of this subject matter going on and

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
kind of going along with engaging him as a serious person in these things, is that not

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
in his own way diminishing science when you do that?

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
First of all, I wouldn't have had Terrence on the first time because it didn't do him

243
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
to what he actually is doing that's interesting to give him this amount of air.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That was a good friend of mine's choice.

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So partially what you're seeing is a relationship between a comedian, Joe Rogan, and a mathematician,

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Eric Weinstein.

247
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Joe's a buddy of mine and he matters to me.

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And he's the one who asked me to come on.

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Some people tried to frame it as if I wanted to go on.

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I had no interest in going on.

251
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But if we were going to watch a mass delusion take shape, certainly I don't want any more

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
mass delusions.

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I also don't want the idea that once these ideas are out there that science is afraid

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
somehow to confront Terrence Howard's new theory of arithmetic.

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He doesn't have a new theory of arithmetic.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And somebody needs to be the adult and say, this is not right.

257
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
On the other hand, you have to appreciate that all it takes is one great idea to move the

258
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
world and a lot of BS is going to be forgiven.

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And if he has a great idea, I would suggest to you it's likely his concept of a six rotor

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
drone that he calls the Lynch pin that's based on a mathematical error where he's fit six

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
pentagons through the edges of a regular tetrahedron giving him six degrees of freedom which

262
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
span what we would call the Lie algebra of the affine group giving him the ability to

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
rotate around a center and move to any point in three dimensional space.

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's an incredibly cool idea.

265
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Now I don't know that it's his.

266
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I believe that it's his, but I don't know that.

267
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I haven't done that work.

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not a drone operator, so I don't realize what the state of the art is.

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But imagine that that was the only thing that he did and that he figured out that these

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
things could fit together as per the Intel drone shows to form capsids in the shape of

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
dodecahedrons, much the way we see viruses doing that with capsimers and protein coats to

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
protect the genetic material.

273
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That would be an incredible contribution of Terrence Howard.

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And the thing that really disgusts me is watching my colleagues make fun of Terrence as easily

275
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
where he is right as where he is wrong.

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It doesn't require that.

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He's clearly a self-taught guy.

278
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He pronounces words like canonically, canonically, which indicates that he's teaching himself.

279
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And for all of this talk of the Neil deGrasse Tyson's where they say, I'm so pleased to see

280
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
active minds engaging with the world of ideas, they're really not.

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And my feeling about this is pretending that Terrence Howard is a fool or an idiot is repugnant to me.

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I mean, if you just take what he said about tones and the periodic table, because of some good

283
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
fortune in my life, I was able to go out to none other than one of the greatest musicians

284
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
now living, Stanley Jordan.

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And say, Stanley, let's share your work on playing the periodic table by using the ionization energies

286
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
as frequency information, much the way Terrence was discussing.

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So my feeling is, is that a lot of my colleagues just don't have enough knowledge.

288
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And even though they're supposedly the academics sitting in professorial seats, they're not behaving

289
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
like professors.

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They're not behaving like academicians.

291
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They're making fun of somebody because it allows them to work out their own personal insecurities.

292
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And that's not going to happen on my watch.

293
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's actually really fascinating because unless I'm mistaken, what you're saying is, look,

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
you might be wrong about 99% of his stuff.

295
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But the 1% might be really significant, which is staggering to me that Terrence Howard has gone

296
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
through life as a movie actor is suddenly doing stuff which is to you quite groundbreaking

297
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
in the very complex world of science and mathematics and so on.

298
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not in science and it's not in mathematics.

299
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If he's doing something that I recognize, it's in engineering, art, and it's possible that he's doing something.

300
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I was able to recognize where his shapes come from, where Neil does not appear to understand, which is fine.

301
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So there's some very beautiful geometry, but it doesn't appear to me to be at a research level.

302
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I don't want to conflate, again, I'm hardly a pushover.

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm saying he's wrong in chemistry, physics, and mathematics.

304
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
In fact, it doesn't rise to the level of a theory that needs to be actively considered.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That said, to dismiss everything he's saying because we can find, you know, sometimes a fly lands in your dish

306
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and you insist that it be taken back at a restaurant.

307
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Other times you just say, you know, five second rule, you're hungry, and it's not the fault of the restaurant.

308
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And you just let it go.

309
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And my feeling about this is what Neil did is really troubling.

310
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What he did is that he advertised a fake openness, which is just submit what your work is to a peer review journal.

311
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Neil either doesn't know the history of peer review, doesn't know why it's called peer review, has no concept of what peer review actually is,

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:16,000
which is bizarre, or he does know, and he's deliberately going to waste Terrence Howard's time because Terrence isn't a peer.

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And the whole concept of peer review, the word peer isn't like a jury of your peers, your fellow citizens.

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's like peers in terms of the House of Lords.

315
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The whole idea of peer review is to keep the lady, the people who don't do science for a living or medicine for a living, out of the review process.

316
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And that's where it was born.

317
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's why it grew up in the 60s and 70s as peer review.

318
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It was as part of a struggle where scientists wanted to wall off their kingdom and say, look, we are taking public money, but we don't want public review.

319
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're not qualified to be here.

320
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Shut up, get out of our lab and let us work.

321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And that's why it's so fiercely defended is because it's the last ditch effort to keep the laity from interfering in matters that they can't understand.

322
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The science itself has been under probably a bigger public assault in terms of its validity as a result of the COVID pandemic.

323
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And I can never remember in my lifetime, certainly, is it damaging when everybody on social media suddenly becomes an epidemiologist,

324
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
wherever it may be, you know, any different type of science you like, or medical expert, whatever.

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
When their views get amplified, like Terrence Howard, if they're completely wrong, they get amplified and shared gazillions of times.

326
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This has happened here with all of the things that he said.

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Is it damaging to the integrity of science when that happens?

328
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And is that a unique problem with social media, amplifying amateur scientific and medical views?

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's a very interesting question.

330
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I would think that we would begin somewhere else.

331
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The greatest damage is when we amplify pseudoscientists who happen to be official pseudoscientists.

332
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So when you take a director of NAI, National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease, and you take that person's contradictory pronouncements

333
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and you amplify those, then suddenly everybody has to learn what mRNA is.

334
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Because they're trying to make a decision for their child and suddenly you've thrust them into advanced biology

335
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
because you've amplified pseudoscience coming out of the National Institute of Health or the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DITRA.

336
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The failure and the pseudoscience is coming from inside the house.

337
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The problem is when a Francis Collins and an Anthony Fauci in private emails can turn their dissenting colleagues,

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,000
fully competent expert dissident colleagues like Jay Bhattacharya and his colleagues at Harvard and Oxford,

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and overnight they become fringe epidemiologists, right?

340
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So more or less what you're seeing is not a failure of science.

341
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What you're seeing is a failure of science to disavow public health.

342
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Public health is not science. Public health is an incredibly bizarre field that tries to straddle two worlds of actual truth and the noble lie.

343
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And as I've said before, the problem is the failure to cancel an ex-spouse's credit card privileges.

344
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
When the person takes the credit card on a spree, science did not cancel its credit card that it had given to public health.

345
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And so what we had was an incredible destruction of trust in science, which is completely unwarranted

346
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
because people who are not acting as scientists, who may have at one time been scientists,

347
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
but have gone over to public policy, were allowed to lie on science's behalf.

348
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's a failure. I understand why the credit rating got beaten up, but for God's sakes, just cut off the credit card

349
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and learn where scientists lie and where they do not. They don't lie generically.

350
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
There's nothing wrong with Hook's law. There's nothing wrong with the adapter hypothesis in biology.

351
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
There's nothing wrong with most of what we consider to be science. We lie in very special places out of necessity.

352
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Let me bring in the other two guests now to debate actually what you've been saying.

353
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Professor Brian Keating, cosmologist from San Diego University and Tom Billio, who's the Impact Theory podcast.

354
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Professor Keating, your response to what you've just been hearing from Eric?

355
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Well, I think scientists, we have a responsibility. Eric's known for calling the term the intellectual dark web.

356
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And I feel like a scientist, we have a responsibility to keep the environmental, intellectual environment clear of pollution.

357
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And I feel like there is a tendency because of this anti-authoritarian moment that we seem to be in to view science as authoritarian.

358
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And then to rebel against it, we look to heroes and people like Terrence or Candace Owens or people like Tucker Carlson.

359
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And they get enormous platforms because of their social media stature.

360
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But to me, to listen to people who have no domain expertise and no proven track record is an affront to actual practicing scientists.

361
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And it's fine to have a hobby. It's fine to do things out of an avocation of love for it.

362
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But it's a bit, to me, an example of the halo effect, which is a cognitive bias.

363
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And you have people you're listening to. In some cases, it's akin to listening to your friend, Piers, and your Tate for marital advice.

364
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He may be a great MMA star and Terrence may be a great actor, but that gives them no and confers no benefit to their scientific practices.

365
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And it would be like me going on to the set of Iron Man and trying to be like Terrence. You would laugh me off the stage and rightfully so.

366
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So we have to look at an exam and these claims that amateurs can do good science.

367
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Eric pointed out in the interview that there's some babies in with the bathwater.

368
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And I'd love to ask my dear friend, Eric, to expound upon those particular babies.

369
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Because to me, to say that there might be some angle or something like that or some drone, it sounds to me a little bit like damning with faint praise as well.

370
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Because if you go through and there's 97 patents that he claims he has, we go through them, we find out that very few of them have been granted.

371
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
There may be a couple that have been granted.

372
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You go through one times one equals two. Eric demonstrated clearly that's not the case.

373
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You go through the periodic table. His ideas are completely wrong there.

374
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
His claims about gravity and building planets, that he's built the planet Saturn or comes out of a biological digestive process of the sun.

375
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
These things are completely fallacious.

376
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So I think there's a danger and it's a symptom of the halo effect.

377
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I mean, just in point about Andrew Tate, he's not a friend of mine. He's someone I've interviewed three times.

378
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But the point I make about him at this debate with someone the other day is he has a huge following on social media, regardless of whether people like me interview him.

379
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
At least when I interview him, I get a chance to challenge him.

380
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And I've really noticed when young men in particular come up to me in the street, which they do with alarming regularity about Andrew Tate,

381
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
that actually the conversation I have with him has moved from, God, you know, Andrew Tate is amazing.

382
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I really liked it when you challenged him about this, this and this.

383
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
In other words, shining a light on people like Andrew Tate actually challenging them on a big platform.

384
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I see tangible impact on the street of those challenges kicking through into people's consciousness.

385
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You know, where they wouldn't if he was just able to do his thing slightly below radar on social media without ever being challenged.

386
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So that's my kind of theory about why I interview people like him, which is in itself open to debate, obviously.

387
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Eric, just in that response to the baby and bathwater, what would you say to Brian Keating's point there?

388
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Well, I tried to say it already that if you take the vertices of a tetrahedron as measured from the center,

389
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you're looking at an angle of the arc cosine of minus one-third, which is about 109.47 in degrees.

390
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And if you take the interior angles of a regular pentagon, it's 108.

391
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So 108 is not 109.47, but it is close enough so that within engineering tolerances,

392
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
you can put six of these motors into a regular tetrahedron and then you can potentially, therefore,

393
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
traverse all of the dimensions needed to orient the object around its center of mass and to move it to any point three-dimensional space.

394
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I've stated that clearly to any technical person who wants to hear it.

395
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It may be that there's prior art and it may be that it doesn't end up being that interesting because of the tolerances or it's too difficult to work.

396
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's fine, but I've already stated what the baby is.

397
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And further, Brian, I was very surprised that you just corrected me on social media.

398
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Now, of course, we're friends and so I don't mind having this back and forth, but you've stated that in my field,

399
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
that peer review is much older than Gillain Maxwell, who was born in 1961.

400
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And you cited a bunch of journals in physics and, in fact, that's simply not true.

401
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, I have Melinda Baldwin's article here, which says, however, most papers accepted for physical review never went out to referees at all.

402
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The editor accepted most papers on its own authority, consulting referees only when he thought he might want to reject a paper.

403
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It was not until the 1960s that all physical review papers were sent out for external referee opinion.

404
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:41,000
More or less, peer review comes out of Utah in 1972 through Senator Wallace Bennett's amendment that forces the issue into the NIH framework

405
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:50,000
because the Medicare Act was established in 1965 making the U.S. taxpayer responsible for medical payments

406
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that they suddenly wanted access to knowing why are we paying all of this money to doctors without the ability to question them.

407
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So, in part, what I'm astounded by is that we're not even aware of our own history.

408
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If George Green, the Miller, with no formal education mailed off a solution to an inversion problem for differential operators,

409
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
which is what gives us Green's functions, which Feynman made famous, he didn't have any training whatsoever.

410
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's in part very dangerous to be offended when people listen to what we say.

411
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And they then say, I keep hearing that science is for everyone and that mathematics is a great place to play.

412
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
There are no bad questions.

413
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And then when they appear to take an interest, we cut their heads off.

414
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And my feeling is that I'm not going to do that.

415
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm going to state what this is.

416
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is an elite activity.

417
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's elite the way a violinist is elite.

418
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's elite the way a surgeon is an elite brain surgeon.

419
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You're not going to have somebody say, hey, I've been doing brain surgery in my backyard on my family members and I'm ready for prime time.

420
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
We are not honest about the extent that this is an elite community.

421
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And the last thing that I would add to what you said is part of the problem is where are the dissident scientists who don't go along inside of the university system, inside of the research institutions?

422
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:40,000
If you had them, they would have been tarred and feathered during DEI because they would have said, who are these foreign intruders into the academic arena?

423
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We must fire them and get them out.

424
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Claudine Gay could never have become president of Harvard.

425
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What we've done is we've gotten rid of all of the dissenting experts.

426
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And the dissenting experts who are going to get up and at the top of their lungs say, hey, we've got a disaster in theoretical physics at the moment.

427
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We have an abomination in the way in which we are pretending that random mutation is decidedly the main engine of Darwinian selection.

428
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We're going to pretend that neoclassical economics is on solid ground.

429
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
All of these things are just absolutely silly.

430
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And effectively, there are no professors who are standing up in good standing as experts doing the job that now Candace Owens is going to fill.

431
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And I promise you that it's more expensive to get rid of your dissenters who actually know what they're talking about than it is to open it up to a public that wonders whether they've just shortened the life of their child

432
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
by giving them an unnecessary experimental pseudo-vaccine.

433
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
All right, let me bring in Tom if you're waiting very patiently.

434
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Tom, what's your perspective on this?

435
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So I think the key thing to understand is if you're arguing at the level of the specifics of the science, you have already lost.

436
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So the goal here has to be to understand that we are living in the age of conspiracy, and that is the problem.

437
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:20,000
When I saw the interview with Terrence Howard and Joe Rogan the first time, I just about dislocated my finger dialing Eric to call him up to be like, hey, you have to refute this stuff.

438
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And the reason that I was very excited to see that he went on and did that and did that so well, Eric, you are a national treasure, is that it does not matter to me what the elites think in isolation.

439
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
All that happens is if people have an idea that hits a critical mass, they begin to bifurcate.

440
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I mean, this is like the multiverse where we no longer have a shared vision of what is true.

441
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That has second and third order consequences that I think are going to be terrifying for the nation.

442
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And when you have a thinker like Eric, who can actually go through and say, hey, let me steal, man, what I have heard you say, which Joe and Terrence would not let him do, which I was mortified by, because he should have just laid it out.

443
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Here are the base assumptions, and then we're going to build up from that.

444
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Now, the reason that I want that to happen is when an idea, whether it is terrible, whether it is obviously terrible, whether every elite person in the world who does science is like, this is the worst idea ever.

445
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You have to understand because of a whole host of things, but certainly COVID being a nice mile marker for us.

446
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It broke people's trust in elites to lead us properly.

447
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It broke our trust in science.

448
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And so now you must, in fact, I will say, scientists, I love you all.

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You have no obligation to do what I'm saying.

450
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I beseech you as somebody who wants society to move forward well, that if an idea hits a certain level of critical mass in the public's awareness, even if you hate it, you are going to have to address it.

451
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If you want to lead us well forward, but you have to do it based on base assumptions so that anybody following along at home that's trying to build their thinking up can go, oh, I actually understand Terrence's base assumptions.

452
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
One times one equals two.

453
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
All things are in motion.

454
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
There's no straight lines like things that, OK, have I understood your position perfectly Terrence?

455
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes, Eric, you have.

456
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
OK, amazing.

457
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Now I'm going to walk through each of those base assumptions and show you which ones are broken and how that is going to make the rest of your sequencing fall apart.

458
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,000
If people would just stay focused on utility, these beliefs work in the real world, we would be in a much better position.

459
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That's what I want to see more of.

460
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
OK, let me bring Brian in.

461
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Before I come to you, Brian, though, I want to play a clip from Candice Owens.

462
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
This was several days after the debate that Rogan and Terrence had.

463
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Why I am now rejecting the cult of science.

464
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So many things that they've lied to us about vaccines, birth control, people that are being injured and that we just accept everything.

465
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
What I said was that science has become a pagan faith.

466
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yes, that's what I actually believe.

467
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Do you want to say that NASA has satanic origins and so on?

468
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Now, I interviewed Candice myself recently and she's a bona fide anti-vaccine, doesn't believe in vaccines at all.

469
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And she has a big following.

470
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And there are lots of people like her out there now saying that because there have been legitimate areas of concern around the COVID vaccines,

471
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
that everything about them is flawed and wrong.

472
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And therefore all the scientists who promoted them are the devil.

473
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And this stuff gathers momentum.

474
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I see it spreading like wildfire.

475
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
She also says that Emmanuel Macron's wife is a man by having had three kids and so on.

476
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And these things gather their own momentum.

477
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And whilst on one level it's sort of humorous,

478
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
on another level it's actually, I think, very damaging because it means that scientists can never be wrong again.

479
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Because if they're wrong about any one aspect of a big thing like a COVID pandemic,

480
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
which is fast moving and evolving and changing, if they're wrong about any aspect of it,

481
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
the whole thing gets trashed by this community.

482
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
This is why we have to understand that this is about the age of conspiracy.

483
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The very thing that Eric, I think, is trying to combat is to say,

484
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
science is about figuring out where we are wrong.

485
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And if scientists stake their reputation as they have done over the last four or five years entirely on always being right,

486
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
then if I can pull one thread and it falls apart, everything is dead.

487
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But if science just gets behind Feynman's statement that this is about distrusting experts and figuring out where they're wrong,

488
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
now it can become a far more fruitful pursuit of what actually works.

489
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Okay, Brian, Brian, your thoughts on that?

490
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, Tom, just because someone's an expert doesn't necessarily mean that you have to distrust them.

491
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
When you look at something, there's a concept called Brandolini's Law,

492
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
which my kids are nearby, so I'm not going to say in its full terms.

493
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But it's basically that it's 10 times easier to produce something that's BS,

494
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and so then it is to refute it.

495
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Therefore, the world is full of unrefuted BS.

496
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And to put that on scientists, to make us sort of the intellectual SEAL Team 6,

497
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
where we can never be wrong.

498
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The terrorists only have to be right once.

499
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And everyone else is relying on us, SEAL Team 6, that we're never wrong.

500
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
To put that in perspective, when you listen to people like this,

501
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Candace tweeting from her laptop and enabled by technology that was invented at Bell Labs,

502
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
the byproduct of the space race, which she also denies, moon landings and so forth.

503
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We're not in New Age.

504
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
We're in a pre-scientific age where people can unfortunately spread not scientific truth

505
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
via scientific proof, which Eric, I'm sorry to say.

506
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
My academic genealogy goes back 17 generations.

507
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Every single one of those people, including my students,

508
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
now in my third generation, I have graduate students out of their own graduate students,

509
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
they've all been through peer review.

510
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We didn't have Pergamum Press and Robert Maxwell, that is true.

511
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Einstein published almost all of his famous papers.

512
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
They were done by peer review.

513
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In fact, the discovery of gravitational waves, one of the most revolutionary discoveries in all of science.

514
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
That prediction, he first tried to get submitted in the early 1930s,

515
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and he didn't want to get a peer review, and there was an error in it.

516
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
He said it would never be detected.

517
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Imagine that.

518
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Einstein made a mistake.

519
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But thanks to peer review, that paper was published in 1936,

520
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and it went on to win the Nobel Prize for some of my good friends.

521
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I've interviewed 20 Nobel laureates on my podcast,

522
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and three of them won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the thing that Einstein thought was impossible.

523
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
We can go back many, many generations, and yes, they didn't have presses.

524
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Of course, the printing press was only a relatively recent invention,

525
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
but you go to the peer review process.

526
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Not far from where peers is right now is the Royal Society,

527
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and also not too far away is the Royal Institution.

528
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I've been to both places.

529
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I've lectured there, and when you go to those places, yes, there wasn't a press,

530
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
but you gather your peers around you, and you do an experiment,

531
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and that experiment would either fail or pass in real time,

532
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and you would get feedback from a jury.

533
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Okay.

534
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
No jury of the peers.

535
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Okay.

536
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Eric, it seems like watching Elon Musk goes with him, actually, the other day.

537
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

538
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I have to respond to that.

539
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Okay, respond first.

540
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Brian, what you just said is not true.

541
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You know, it's just, the fact is, is that Einstein...

542
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The Einstein paper was not published in 1936 after peer review there?

543
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Sorry, that was John Tate, who was the editor at Physical Review before Simon Pasternak,

544
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
before Sam Goodschmidt.

545
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yes, it is true that most of Einstein's work was not peer reviewed.

546
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That's why he was incensed.

547
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
He'd never sent another paper to Physical Review if I'm not incorrect.

548
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Please check me on it.

549
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Was that paper reviewed?

550
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The fact is, there was one paper with Rosen that was peer reviewed,

551
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
which incensed Einstein because he was used to not being peer reviewed.

552
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And he was wrong about it.

553
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
In other words, until peer review pointed out by Eddington, Eddington helped out as well

554
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and said that there was another and it's calculation.

555
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Peer review is not referee review, right?

556
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We had external referees that were occasionally sought,

557
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but what you cite about the Royal Society is, in fact,

558
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
an error introduced into the literature by Merton.

559
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The famous historian of science who was the father of the Merton, of Black Scholes Merton fame.

560
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And that was an erroneous claim that peer review began, I think, in the 1700s.

561
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
What we currently call peer review is far more recent

562
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and it is fantastic to find out that our professor does not know the history of peer review in its own subjects

563
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:10,000
because what we have is we have a chorus of people with the highest credentials repeating a fable.

564
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And we can't always tell when malware has entered our minds.

565
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But I would submit to you, sir, that despite your pedigree, in general,

566
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:32,000
your predecessors were not peer reviewed in any modern sense of the term before the 1970s,

567
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
certainly before the 1960s.

568
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The beginning of forms for external referees begins, I think, in the 1930s under John Tate.

569
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I just don't think you know the history.

570
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I don't know. And in fact, I invite you to go down to the Royal Institution next time you're in London

571
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and you'll see pictures of Michael Faraday, of J.J. Thompson, of Eddington.

572
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You'll see them in front of audiences. Was there a peer review process before journals?

573
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
When would they be journal nature?

574
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The average person is perfect in themselves in the face right now.

575
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
As somebody that loves you two, literally, I know both these guys. Eric, I know very well.

576
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Both have been on my show. Brian, I love you guys.

577
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So I say this because I am begging you.

578
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The average person wants to chew through their TV set right now or their laptop as they're listening to this.

579
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And the reason is they don't care about this.

580
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's already done.

581
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Sorry, sorry.

582
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Hold on. Let me finish. Let me finish.

583
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
The world cares about people like they want to hear what Joe Rogan has to say.

584
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
They want to hear who goes on his show.

585
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
They are absolutely going to listen to Candice.

586
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I think, Brian, you brought that up. Candice is about to sweep the world.

587
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And if I could just get you guys on board with the reality that we are in a very difficult moment right now,

588
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
where, yes, you guys are being asked to do a public service,

589
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
which is to collide with these people who do not have your scientific bona fides,

590
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
but the average person does not care,

591
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
but they will actually listen to your collision of ideas for sure,

592
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
because I took a lot away from you talking to Terrence.

593
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And the first time I heard Terrence, I was like, maybe this is genius. I don't know.

594
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You know, it's so interesting. I was going to say, actually, Eric,

595
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
earlier that I saw Elon Musk recently, many of the first time,

596
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and he did a fascinating Q&A about everything from colonising Mars to humanoid robots and so on.

597
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But I also, we talked about X and his purchase of Twitter and then two X.

598
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
One of the best things I've seen in terms of populist peer review is community notes now on X,

599
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
where I often see things which are spinning around, which are complete nonsense,

600
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and then you see a very well-sourced community note killing it.

601
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And it does seem to have an effect, because that in itself, because it's happening in the same medium,

602
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
starts to also spread like wildfire and tends to kill them quite quickly.

603
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Are you a fan of what Elon is doing with X? Is this helping it as a populist peer reviewing?

604
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yeah, again, this is one of these Wild West conversations where it's not peer review.

605
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The whole concept of peer review is peer, and community notes is community, right?

606
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And so in a certain sense, the point is it's an anti-peer review.

607
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's working pretty well right now.

608
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But keep in mind that Wikipedia worked pretty well until people figured out how to game it.

609
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So my concern is, is that what you're looking at with peer review and with community notes,

610
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:44,000
which is anti-peer review, if you will, is technologies that are in the process of being probed and gamed.

611
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And just to refute what Tom was saying before, Tom, I don't disagree at all.

612
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We are going to have to deal with the Candace phenomena.

613
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But the reason the Candace phenomenon is happening is that you don't have any expert dissident opinion.

614
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
If you have five professors shout me down that I don't know what I'm talking about with respect to peer review,

615
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and I happen to be completely right, I will be told that I'm not an academic,

616
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
despite the fact that we all speak the same language and have the same credentials.

617
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
What is going on is that the world is not crying out for Candace Owen.

618
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It's crying out for where is the physician with my daughter's interests at heart?

619
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Where is the biologist who's willing to stand up to a Tony Fauci and say, I completely disagree?

620
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Why is it that we keep having these fake consensus?

621
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And these consensus are basically determined by getting rid of the people who won't shut up

622
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and who won't sit down and who won't sing from the hymnal.

623
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And what I'm trying to say is what you just saw was an interchange between two colleagues

624
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,000
with a great deal of love and respect for each other on an issue where I'm claiming that the good professor is simply an error.

625
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And if you had somebody saying that around the Wuhan lab and the origin of COVID

626
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,000
or the potential danger of the vaccines or the liability regime in which they were negotiated,

627
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
that this is an abomination, that we can't sue the manufacturers,

628
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
you would have a totally different world. Nobody would be listening to Candace Owen.

629
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
They would be trying to track Jay Bhattacharya.

630
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,000
They would be trying to track all of the experts who were standing up with their interests at heart.

631
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
The big problem in the United States is we used to have experts in the right chairs who dissented.

632
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And now what you have is a group of people who know to keep their head down.

633
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Brian, just want to end with just quick thoughts from you and Tom before we finish.

634
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Give me some hope about the future of science.

635
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Clearly, I think it's indisputable that science and the integrity of science and scientists

636
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
has never been under a bigger attack than it is today.

637
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
A lot of it fueled by conspiracy theorists and social media.

638
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Give me some hope for the future of science and its integrity.

639
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I think the hope comes from my students, the people that I work with,

640
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
the incredible breakthroughs that I've been witness to both personally and part of a team of 300 scientists

641
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
that are working to uncover what happened during the first nanosecond in the cosmos's history.

642
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
What kind of breakthroughs do we now unlock knowing that the universe is suffused with dark energy?

643
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
What do we learn about the future possibly with new technology like high temperature,

644
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
room temperature, superconductivity, or perhaps fusion?

645
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
That's never been a more exciting time to be a scientist.

646
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And they hear about science as its best days are behind us.

647
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I think that's nonsense.

648
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
On the other hand, we have to guard against conspiracy theories and flat earthers

649
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and all sorts of anti-vaxxers and things like that because there is always a grain of truth.

650
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
As Isaac Asimov said, if you believe the earth is flat, you're wrong.

651
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
But if you believe it's perfectly round two, you're also wrong, but you're less wrong.

652
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And I think what we want to do as scientists is not be held to this impossible secret service level

653
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
where we can't make a single mistake.

654
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Recognize that we do make mistakes, but science is self-correcting.

655
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And part of that self-correction mechanism has to do with being analyzed by your peers.

656
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Whatever Eric and I disagree with about in the past, today's peer review is perhaps, as I like to say,

657
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
it's the worst system for gauging scientific process except for all the rest.

658
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Tom?

659
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
All right.

660
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So the thing that I really want to make sure that I'm being heard on, Brian,

661
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
is you keep repeating, we shouldn't be held to this team, CL team six level of perfection.

662
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
What I'm saying is silence, science has a branding problem.

663
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You guys created a branding problem.

664
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I'll just say during COVID where it was, hey, everybody listened to us and everything is going to be fine.

665
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Masks don't work, by the way, but save them for the health workers because they need them.

666
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It's like, so everyone's brain starts sketching out.

667
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Also, no one has talked about social media yet.

668
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Social media, this is done.

669
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The horses are out of the stable.

670
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The toothpaste is all over the floor.

671
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
The genie has flown out of the bottle.

672
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
We are living in a reality where everybody is a publisher.

673
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Everybody is going to say things and people are screaming out for Candace Owens.

674
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm telling you right now, as somebody, I'm almost sure I'm going to disagree with every word out of her mouth.

675
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And yet I am utterly fascinated by how she has already captured people in terms of their imagination because this is what they want.

676
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
As a marketer, I can tell you, you guys are terrible.

677
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Like if I have to market you, oh God, even though I look at Eric and I'm like, is this the smartest human I've ever encountered?

678
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
For sure.

679
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Do I want him at my house just whispering in my ear all the things to do?

680
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Absolutely.

681
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
My life will be way better.

682
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
However, from a marketing perspective, oh dear God.

683
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So it's like we have a much bigger challenge that we have to overcome.

684
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And Candace doesn't have that problem.

685
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
She's electrifying.

686
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
She captures what people want to hear.

687
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And what I'm saying is the service that you guys can now play in the world that we live in is to say science isn't about being right.

688
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Science is about two things.

689
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Number one, the pursuit of utility.

690
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Einstein's breakthroughs matter because they give us GPS and nuclear energy.

691
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That's the only reason that they matter.

692
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And the second thing is we know we're wrong about a whole lot of stuff.

693
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And so our job is just go through what are all the things we're wrong about that are stopping us?

694
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And I hope I'm not talking out of class, Eric.

695
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Oh, please God.

696
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,000
But Eric has said to me many times, we ought to be traveling the cosmos and we aren't because string theory has gotten stuck.

697
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Exactly.

698
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So you have to get new ideas.

699
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You have to break the old paradigms in order to get the utility that you want.

700
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And if we judge every idea by its utility and not by where it comes from, we'll be in a much better place.

701
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You know that the best thing about this debate, Tom, is that it's actually by having this kind of conversation on a platform like this that is watched globally in pretty big numbers now that we can probably get to where you want to get science to.

702
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And the other thing I observe is I host a lot of debates between people who disagree and they normally end up screaming at each other.

703
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,000
What I loved about you three was the more abusive you became in a very nice polite manner, the more you all laughed.

704
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And that is the way to debate.

705
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So thank you all very much indeed.

706
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Thank you, Pierce.

707
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Thank you.
