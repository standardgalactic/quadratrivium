00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Dr. Eric Weinstein is a Harvard-trained mathematician and a titan of the so-called

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,760
Intellectual Dark Web. They're the big iconoclastic thinkers who span political divides to challenge

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,720
mainstream narratives, stoking controversy and debate along the way. Dr. Weinstein tackles

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,200
everything from Putin and Ukraine to globalization, and Jeffrey Epstein has become a superstar

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,800
guest on the world's biggest podcast and streaming shows.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,640
You met Jeffrey Epstein.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,400
The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. There are people that you need in your dark

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,960
hours. As soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,960
And now he goes uncensored. I'm always surprised when people with your kind of intellect wrestle

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,280
with any kind of quandary about Russian dictator invading sovereign democratic country.

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,480
International nations like Russia have concerns that don't have to do only with their exact

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
borders.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,400
I mean, do you think anyone like Putin who has 6,000 nuclear weapons at his disposal

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,120
would want to start a war that would obliterate everything?

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,360
And somebody, a pair of nunchucks, they're most likely to knock themselves out rather

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,480
than to become Bruce Lee. We sit here with a ticking time bomb. We don't know how long

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
we have.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,560
The four most overrated things in life were lobster, champagne, anal sex, and picnics.

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,480
I don't really know much about champagne. Perhaps the next question.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,280
Are there any limits to free speech?

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,360
It has morphed more into a question of what can I get away with that might not be true?

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,920
I've got 10 things. Rapid fire.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,520
No, no, no. Yeah, I decline. No, I'm quite serious.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Eric Weisd, great to have you.

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Good to be with you.

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,520
So I was just checking your Wikipedia a minute ago.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
And under education it said...

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
It has a bitty face recently.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Well, you can challenge this if you like, but under education it said Weinstein received

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,520
his PhD in Mathematical Physics from Harvard University in 1992 in his dissertation Extension

31
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,520
of Self-Duel Yang-Mills Equations Across the Eighth Dimension.

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Weinstein showed that the self-duel Yang-Mills Equations were not peculiar to Dimension 4

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,520
and admitted generalizations to higher dimensions.

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,520
And I realized at that point, having read that, Eric, that you and I were probably on

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,520
slightly different intellectual pathways in our lives, and this might be quite a challenging encounter.

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
You have a different theory about the Yang-Mills Equations.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,520
By the way, that's the most accurate thing I've heard in my Wikipedia entry sometimes.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Maybe things are improving.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,520
I mean, look, obviously you've got a massive brain.

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Do you think that's been a force for good or for angst in your life?

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Yeah, I see evil isn't on the table.

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
It can be. I avoided that.

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,520
I mean, to be honest, I hope it's inspiring to people with learning differences

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
and neurodivergence everywhere.

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I was a terrible student in high school.

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
So, to me, it's quite funny.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
I mean, I don't know what to say.

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,520
It speaks to the triumph of will and the power of dyslexia.

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,520
The intellectual dark web is its core.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,520
I've interviewed many people from Miss Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson,

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Professor Stephen Pinker, and so on.

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,520
And the common themes seem to be people who just decide that they're not going to accept

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,520
everything that the mainstream media pumps out to the public.

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,520
They want to challenge, you know, what I would call group think.

56
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,520
They want to challenge tribalism, particularly fueled by social media.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,520
They just want to be, I guess, annoyingly curious and combative

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,520
about stuff that we're told collectively we have to believe.

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I think it's a lot more than that.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,520
I mean, I never explained who was in it nor what it meant.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
So people try to wrap ideas around it.

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,520
One of the reasons that it gained currency was that no one had a description for the fact

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,520
that many smart people were not going along with the sort of intellectual hegemony

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,520
of the mainstream, which should represent a huge diversity of viewpoints.

65
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
But in fact, that's only honored in the breach.

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,520
I think that one of the things that is not frequently thought about in terms of that project

67
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
was the importance of civility.

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,520
It's incredibly difficult to tease out our differences when we're yelling at each other,

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,520
calling names, and in point of fact, I believe that we've lost the ability to have good fights.

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Our fights are terrible.

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
I totally agree.

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,520
We can't get good people to sit down because without intellectual Queensbury rules,

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
all you get is eye gouging.

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,520
And while there's a segment of the internet that's always looking for somebody to rip off an arm

75
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,520
and lose a digit, most of us want to live to see another day and continue to develop our points

76
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,520
and even concede when the other person has a better one.

77
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,520
So the dirty little secret of the intellectual dark web is that even though we were across

78
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,520
the political spectrum, we were pretty darn good to each other for a long time.

79
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
And I think that that's the key to getting great fights.

80
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,520
What I've noticed is that Ben Shapiro still has a pinned tweet.

81
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
I think facts don't care about your feelings.

82
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:38,520
And I've definitely noticed in debates that people go ad hominem very quickly and very abusively,

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,520
normally to mask the fact that their actual argument is devoid of fact.

84
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Well, when you don't have a point, it's an excellent tactic.

85
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Where are we in the world right now, Eric?

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,520
You've written and spoken so much about the state of the world,

87
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,520
but I always say to people that if you actually look at it statistically,

88
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,520
this is the best time to ever be alive.

89
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
We're living longer, we're living healthier, there's less child poverty, there are fewer wars and so on and so on.

90
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,520
By every conceivable metric, this is arguably the best time to ever be alive

91
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,520
and yet so many people seem so angst ridden.

92
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Young people have an epidemic of anxiety.

93
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,520
And a lot of people having real problems just dealing with life

94
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,520
when in fact compared to all their ancestors, they've got it good.

95
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Why?

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Well, see, you've got to stop drinking with Steven Pinkler.

97
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,520
It was actually him that said that, you're right.

98
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Well, this is a terrible idea that was spread by Steven Pinker.

100
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,520
And what it is to borrow from my physics and math background

101
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,520
is you can't understand the conservation of energy

102
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,520
if you don't have terms for both potential and kinetic energy.

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
So if you think about what you're talking about,

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,520
you're talking about the cessation of all kinds of, in some sense, human kinetic energy

105
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,520
from the early part of the 20th century with all of the two terrible wars,

106
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
a horrible pandemic, et cetera.

107
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,520
We don't see that much in the world.

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Only Mao's leap forward, I think, rises to that level of atrocity.

109
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
So that has been a huge improvement.

110
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,520
The problem is why that is the case, which is largely because in 1952-53,

111
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,520
over six months, we acquired the secrets to both the atom and the cell.

112
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,520
So with the first hydrogen bomb named Ivy Mike in the Pacific

113
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,520
and Watson and Crick's elucidation of the double helix structure for nucleic acid,

114
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,520
we became godlike in terms of our power.

115
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,520
And as a result, we acquired the first time, for the first time,

116
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
the ability to end the human project.

117
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,520
And I think it's the loss of an indefinite human future that has to be restored

118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
and no one can figure out how to do it.

119
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,520
So we sit here effectively with a ticking time bomb.

120
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
We don't know how long we have.

121
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,520
And things are very pleasant.

122
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I mean, you can sit in a coffee shop and have a perfectly good life,

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
but you never know when the end is coming.

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Whereas in a previous era, you didn't know how often you were going to be conscripted into a war.

125
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
But on the other hand, there was no chance of humans extinguishing themselves.

126
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,520
So I think you really have to broaden that concept.

127
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,520
And I would agree with you in terms of the realized terror that has engulfed the world.

128
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,520
In fact, most of it is potential terror.

129
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Did you watch Oppenheim in the movie?

130
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Sure.

131
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
What did you think of it?

132
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
It's very tough.

133
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:57,520
I don't think people remember that we have this power and that it was unleashed by science

134
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,520
and in particular was unleashed by effectively my former colleagues.

135
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,520
So that when you see a cameo appearance by Richard Feynman, let's say,

136
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,520
or at least someone portraying him,

137
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,520
you have to recognize that these are the people who unleashed the doomsday scenario.

138
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:27,520
And for me, because we ceased exploding atmospheric nuclear weapons in 1962, I believe,

139
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,520
we've really grown far too, I don't know how to say it,

140
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,520
we're too unconcerned with the danger in which we live.

141
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,520
And for me, it was an attempt to reawaken our self-knowledge

142
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,520
and to remind ourselves how important science is,

143
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,520
how currently we say that scientists are feeble, they don't live in the real world.

144
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I promise you, you'll be living in their world for the rest of time.

145
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,520
This is very much the real world and it was painful in part, but it was a very intriguing film.

146
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,520
When Vladimir Putin rattles his nuclear sabre,

147
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,520
which he does regularly as a form of trying to intimidate the West in particular,

148
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,520
do you think he means it? Do you think anyone like Putin, who has 6,000 nuclear weapons at his disposal,

149
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,520
is ever, I don't know whether the stupid isn't the right word,

150
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:32,520
is ever going to be in a position where he would want to start a war that would obliterate everything?

151
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,520
You can ask the same of us.

152
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Yeah.

153
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,520
I'm quite serious.

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,520
In terms of a cultural difference, the Russians regularly use nuclear explosions for engineering purposes.

155
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,520
They have a comfort with nuclear weapons that we lack.

156
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,520
I think that many Americans do not really understand the cultural difference

157
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:03,520
between Central and Eastern Europe and the modern West, which is frankly terrifying.

158
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:11,520
I see cross-cultural miscommunication as a potential start to a nuclear scenario.

159
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,520
As we've seen from the Cold War, there have been many situations in which,

160
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,520
if there's a glitch in a system and you believe that somebody is firing upon you,

161
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
that you're forced to make a very tough decision.

162
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Quite honestly, humans are just not good enough to play this kind of game theory.

163
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,520
And remember that with the Cold War, it was basically a bipolar conflict.

164
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
You're about to move to multi-polar game theory,

165
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,520
and I can assure you that it's a much less stable scenario

166
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,520
where you're trying to figure out what eight different players are doing

167
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,520
with regional conflicts and unannounced nuclear powers entering the fray.

168
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Do you worry more about nuclear Armageddon or AI becoming sentient?

169
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I worry about people trying to make AI a more pressing problem than nuclear weapons.

170
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,520
A lot of the cool kids in Silicon Valley have developed a meme,

171
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,520
which is that, oh, AI is far more dangerous than nukes.

172
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,520
And that may be in the long run, but at the moment, it's not even close.

173
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,520
However, it feels kind of passe to worry about nuclear weapons.

174
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Five years ago or so, I think I started publicly calling for rare atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons,

175
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,520
because I think the greatest danger at the moment is that fear of nuclear weapons is seen as out of vogue,

176
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,520
and we have to reacquaint our viscera with the danger in which we live.

177
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I mean, I did the last interview with Professor Stephen Hawking before he sadly died,

178
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
and I asked him what's the biggest threat to mankind,

179
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,520
and he said when artificial intelligence learns to self-design,

180
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,520
the implication being that when it does, the first thing it would do

181
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,520
is probably conclude that humans are completely pointless and irrational and useless in many cases,

182
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
and they just get rid of us.

183
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I don't think that's his best work.

184
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Really? You're not as concerned?

185
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Well, in the long run, I think that it's a huge concern,

186
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,520
but if you look at what large language models are

187
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,520
and how quickly humans have confused large language models for general intelligence,

188
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,520
it tells you that maybe more humans need to spend time coding

189
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,520
and understanding the transformer architecture which enabled this recent mini-revolution.

190
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I mean, it's absolutely astounding, but mostly what these machines are doing are feeding us back to us,

191
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,520
and once they've read all our books and read all our papers,

192
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,520
it's easily possible that this model and this architecture may plateau.

193
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,520
But isn't it the same kind of situation with nuclear weapons

194
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:01,520
where in decent hands, supposedly decent hands of people who have a moral code,

195
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,520
a code of ethics who don't want to do the wrong thing,

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,520
nuclear weapons can be controlled and can be safe,

197
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,520
but in nefarious hands from people with evil intent, they become incredibly dangerous.

198
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,520
And I would say it's the same argument with AI, isn't it?

199
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I don't agree with the premise, so maybe ask that to someone else.

200
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,520
I believe that if you take ten very moral people and very intelligent people

201
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,520
and you give them all nuclear weapons and the ability to annihilate each other,

202
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,520
you can play all sorts of game-theoretic experiments

203
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,520
and find that we're simply not wise enough to solve coordination problems and signaling problems.

204
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,520
I just don't agree with this idea that it's our morality and our intellect

205
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
which makes nuclear weapons dangerous.

206
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
It is simply the power.

207
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,520
It's like handing a lightsaber to somebody in a Star Wars film

208
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:04,520
and watching them learn by slicing off a leg and an arm within the first five minutes.

209
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Hand somebody a pair of nunchucks.

210
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,520
They're most likely to knock themselves out rather than to become Bruce Lee.

211
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Yeah, but if you have Mother Teresa with a finger on the nuclear button and Adolf Hitler,

212
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,520
the chances are more likely that it'll be the bad guy that presses it.

213
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:28,520
You took two people, one is much worse than the other, but those aren't my favorites.

214
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Mother Teresa, we don't need to reliticate the Christopher Hitchens point.

215
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:43,520
I would say that I just don't know of these good people who can steward nuclear weapons.

216
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,520
It's simply too much power.

217
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Or if you think about it in terms of systems,

218
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:56,520
a democracy is capable of having a string of 10 moral ethical leaders

219
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,520
and then it gets itself into a period of distress

220
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,520
and suddenly it elects somebody who's completely unfit for the office.

221
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,520
We don't have the ability to live with this amount of leverage.

222
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
I had a good relationship with Christopher Hitchens.

223
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I employed him actually as a columnist when I was editor for Daily Mirror

224
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
and he once sent me one of my favorite emails ever, which was he said,

225
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:23,520
the four most overrated things in life were lobster, champagne, anal sex and picnics.

226
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:32,520
I don't really know much about champagne and some of the other items on your list

227
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,520
don't appeal to me for this conversation, perhaps the next question.

228
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,520
One of your big thoughts is that western institutions, including politicians,

229
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,520
scientists and media, are actively lying to us

230
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,520
and we've seen this exacerbated by things like the pandemic,

231
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,520
like modern warfare and all the propaganda that flies around it.

232
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,520
How much of your belief that they're lying to us is driven by,

233
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I guess, the social media element of this,

234
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,520
where everything is amplified in real time to the public in a way it never used to be.

235
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,520
In other words, information used to flow to us in a far slower and more controlled way

236
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,520
whereas now everything is coming out as 24-7 in real time.

237
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Well, you know, I hold an unpopular view,

238
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,520
which is that public-spirited fictions are essential to proper governance.

239
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,520
The problem isn't that they're lying to us,

240
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,520
the problem is that the lies are not public-spirited, they are not competent,

241
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,520
they're not adult-level fictions and they're not minimal.

242
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
You want to lie as little as possible.

243
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,520
A French philosopher once said that a nation is a collection of people

244
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
that have agreed to forget something in common.

245
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,520
So in part, you know, if you were to resolve the contradictions,

246
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,520
let's say, in the United States First Amendment,

247
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,520
you might find that you had no constitution.

248
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,520
The problem is the nature of the lies

249
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,520
and they are not adult-level and I don't mean to boast on your program,

250
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,520
but I have an IQ above 40, so I find this really distressing

251
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:25,520
that I'm constantly asked to believe things that no child should be asked to believe.

252
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I mean, you tweeted the other day about Ukraine and Putin.

253
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I can't tell you my position on US strategy in Ukraine.

254
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,520
If I don't know more, all I know is that in a democracy,

255
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm being lied to and pressured to support something I don't sufficiently understand.

256
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
That's it. I mean, you could take that argument in 1939

257
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
and say, you know, when Hitler invaded Poland,

258
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
I don't know enough about it.

259
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
I haven't been told enough about it by my government.

260
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Therefore, I can't take a position about Adolf Hitler.

261
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I would say that what Putin is doing in Ukraine is not dissimilar, actually,

262
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,520
and that his aspirations may not be quite as heinous

263
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
in terms of global domination as Hitler.

264
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,520
But I would say his aspirations are heinous.

265
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,520
And I'm always surprised when people with your kind of intellect

266
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,520
wrestle with any kind of quandary about Russian dictator

267
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,520
invading sovereign democratic country and murdering loads of people

268
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
and helping himself to loads of land

269
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,520
and why that shouldn't be in everyone's interest to repel.

270
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Well, I would like to think that's because you misunderstand my position.

271
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,520
But it could be a failure of intellect on my part.

272
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,520
We're in a very long-running post-Cold War strategy

273
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:47,520
where in 1999, I believe we extended Article 5 NATO status to Poland,

274
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,520
which was not former Soviet Union but was Warsaw Pact.

275
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I didn't have a problem at that point.

276
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,520
I think it was in 2004 where we extended Article 5 status

277
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

278
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,520
And at that point, I clearly felt that I didn't understand what we were doing.

279
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,520
I believe that, you know, Riga is within a thousand miles or kilometer,

280
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
I don't even know, of Moscow.

281
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,520
And, you know, because the Cuban Missile Crisis was very much top of mind

282
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
during the part of the Cold War that I saw and its aftermath,

283
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,520
I very well remember the concept of American spheres of influence.

284
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
The Cuba was not considered a sovereign nation that could choose to do whatever it wanted

285
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
because it was simply too close to the United States.

286
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I think that, in part, it's the desire to only put on one pair of glasses,

287
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
one set of lenses.

288
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,520
The sovereign nation lens clearly suggests that Putin is a madman

289
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,520
and his crossing of the border of Ukraine, it's a slam dunk.

290
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
So, it's not that I don't understand your point,

291
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,520
but then, again, there's another set of glasses, which is the spheres of influence glasses.

292
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,520
And that says that, in fact, powerful nations like Russia have concerns

293
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,520
that don't have to do only with their exact borders.

294
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
And if you look, for example, at a time lapse of the borders in central-eastern Europe,

295
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
you'll notice that they've been fluid for forever.

296
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,520
If every time there is a border readjustment, we go to the brink of nuclear war,

297
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
that's game over.

298
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Furthermore, there are very complicated relations in central and eastern Europe.

299
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,520
And I don't think that Americans are particularly adept at discussing them,

300
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,520
forcing us to say Slava Ukraine as a slogan.

301
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,520
We're not allowed to say glory to anything, but we're supposed to be 100% on board.

302
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,520
This is a long-running, statecraft-level narrative.

303
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Clearly, there was an idea in place as far back as the fall of the Berlin Wall.

304
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I don't understand what the strategy is.

305
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
It might be the right strategy.

306
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm certainly not supporting Putin, who's an absolute brutal thug.

307
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
That's not in question.

308
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,520
The problem is, is that we are now the stewards of a thermonuclear planet.

309
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:21,520
And the simple application of an idea that he crossed the border of a sovereign nation

310
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
after everything we've been doing in Ukraine and all the games that we've played,

311
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,520
I don't think that this really makes sense.

312
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:35,520
And the problem, as I understand it, is that we keep telling the audience, the electorate, if you will,

313
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,520
that these incredibly simplistic lenses with which we choose to view everything

314
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,520
are sufficient to actually form grown-up opinions, and they aren't.

315
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,520
I mean, the irony, of course, is that if Ukraine had not been encouraged to give up its nuclear defence,

316
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,520
then Putin is highly unlikely to have invaded it.

317
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:03,520
There are so many choices that we have made in terms of how we've handled the post-Cold War

318
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,520
former Soviet Union countries and Warsaw Pact countries.

319
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I think you have to understand that this is part of a long-running grand strategy,

320
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,520
and it's not shared with me.

321
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:24,520
I'm not even positive that today's State Department officials are really 100% in...

322
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,520
that they have good knowledge of what this extended plan is.

323
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Very often what you find is that the architects of a multi-decade plan die

324
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,520
and they don't teach their successors what the actual strategy was.

325
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,520
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, did you think it was right

326
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:49,520
that American boots were put on the ground to kick him out, given it wasn't a NATO country?

327
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Kuwait, in some sense, is in part created as a block

328
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,520
so that Iraq would have the tiniest sea front.

329
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:11,520
The creation, in some sense, of states by colonial powers or accidents of history...

330
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,520
I think the problem here is that Saddam Hussein was an absolute brute,

331
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,520
but he was a brute in a region in which one has to become brutish.

332
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,520
It is astounding the extent to which many Iraqis who were relatively middle class

333
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,520
and knew the difficulties of governing in that region viewed him as an absolute brute,

334
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,520
but were appreciative of his efforts of keeping Iraq relatively secular.

335
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,520
That's not to say that I'm a Saddam Hussein supporter far from it.

336
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,520
It's just to say that we keep communicating very strange things into these regions.

337
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:55,520
For example, when I think it was George Herbert Walker Bush who told the Marsh Arabs in the south of Iraq

338
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,520
and then got them slaughtered, we have to be very careful in our communications

339
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,520
in incredibly different regions from our own.

340
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Do you think it's really in America's national interest that Vladimir Putin could win in Ukraine,

341
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:20,520
could just seize a vast chunk of that country and claim it as Russian, as he did with Crimea

342
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,520
and it's, of course, after he voted Georgia as well?

343
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Do you think it's in America's national interest that a Russian dictator expands the power

344
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,520
and geographical land of Russia?

345
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:42,520
No. No, no, no. I very much don't want Vladimir Putin to taste victory.

346
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I don't want him to try to reassemble the former Soviet Union.

347
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,520
So how do you stop him?

348
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Well, in part, you might want to cooperate.

349
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:03,520
You might have wanted to have cooperated with him more and it's very difficult.

350
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Look, my family comes from the region.

351
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Almost 100% of my ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Ukraine and Latvia.

352
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,520
I'm very hesitant to talk in Western media about the realities of the region

353
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,520
because I don't think that Americans have been prepared for quite what the pressures are in this area

354
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,520
and it is incredibly important that we understand just how dangerous this region is,

355
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
in part because of the skill level of the players.

356
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Vladimir Putin may be a brute, a butcher, but he's also incredibly skilled.

357
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:47,520
You have to remember that America's nuclear power effectively came from a bunch of emigres from places like Lvov,

358
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,520
which is now called Lviv, which I think it was a Polish city, which is now claimed to be Ukrainian.

359
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,520
We have to appreciate that this is a region that is incredibly skilled, incredibly dangerous,

360
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,520
a source of intellectual horsepower which built America's own atomic arsenal, refugees from the area.

361
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,520
So I think that you just have to understand that most of us are way out of our depths

362
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,520
if we don't have great information, we don't have cultural and historical understanding of the tensions between these people.

363
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,520
I want to just change tack to free speech.

364
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,520
In your estimation, are there any limits to free speech?

365
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Well, it depends. People say free markets and there are all sorts of limits on free markets.

366
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Usually when we say free speech, adults know the limits. You know that there are libel limits.

367
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,520
There's Brandenburg versus Ohio. There are all sorts of things that you can't say or do.

368
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:57,520
We have export controls. In fact, in physics, there's a concept called restricted data

369
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,520
where if you have an idea and you're not a federal employee and you don't have a security clearance,

370
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:11,520
if the idea touches nuclear weapons, you may not share it at all because it is born secret.

371
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,520
There are huge limits on speech that are part of free speech.

372
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,520
So when we say free speech, I'm 100% for free speech, but that is an understanding that that's a reserved term of art.

373
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,520
It's not unrestricted speech. It has never been. It can't exist as such.

374
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,520
You and I think are both big fans of Elon Musk. I had an interview with him at the start of the year

375
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,520
which he unceremoniously cancelled when he found a clip of me on the show mildly criticising his decision

376
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,520
to let Alex Jones back onto X having previously said he would never let him back on

377
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,520
and he wouldn't let people who stand on the graves of dead children on the platform.

378
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,520
I thought he was wrong to change his mind about Alex Jones, but I found it quite ironic

379
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:06,520
that Elon, who is a constant promoter of free speech, particularly on X, would not want to engage in an interview with me

380
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,520
because I criticised him over something like that.

381
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Well, you know, everyone wants to date free speech, but when free speech wants to date other people,

382
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:23,520
we always have second thoughts and I'd like to think that I'm at least self-aware enough to realise

383
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:31,520
that most of the things that we stand up for, truth, ethics, free speech, etc., when they bind on us,

384
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,520
we as humans are very likely to change our mind. That's why we try to enshrine this in law.

385
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,520
It's sort of a Ulysses contract that I know that I'm going to be against free speech when it's used in a way that I don't like.

386
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,520
I bristled when you said you read my Wikipedia entry because I have idiots who constantly try to deface it.

387
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,520
On the other hand, because I'm locked into a free speech mentality,

388
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,520
it stays my hand when I try to say that that's something that shouldn't be permitted.

389
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:05,520
Effectively, I have to put up with the empowerment of idiots and dangerous ones at that

390
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,520
if I'm really signed up for the free speech project and, you know, there you have it.

391
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
It was interesting on Wikipedia. I mean, my eldest son noticed, I don't know if you know if it's still there,

392
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,520
if I never look at it, but it said that I was the youngest of four children

393
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,520
and I happened to be the oldest of four children. So it's a tiny little fact.

394
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,520
It doesn't matter to anybody other than it's wrong.

395
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,520
So my eldest son as a journalist corrected it.

396
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,520
And then whoever it was who put the erroneous information up there,

397
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,520
re-corrected it back to the false one. And this went on and on and on and on,

398
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
and there was no end to it.

399
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Where my eldest son kept saying I was the eldest.

400
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,520
And whoever this person was kept saying I was the youngest.

401
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,520
And all it showed me was that Wikipedia professes to be, you know,

402
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:57,520
a great vehicle for information, accurate information about people and so on and free speech and so on.

403
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,520
But there's not much it can do if someone is utterly determined to put disinformation out there.

404
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Well, it was briefly a great resource.

405
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,520
The problem that we find is it had certain flaws.

406
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
When you had rules about, you know, authoritative sources,

407
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,520
and sources were in fact largely authoritative, it worked well.

408
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,520
As you've seen the degradation of authoritative sources and as people become more sophisticated

409
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,520
about what kinds of exploits work on Wikipedia, you have a very dangerous situation,

410
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,520
which is that technical articles continue to be of fairly high quality

411
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,520
because there's no one determined to graffiti over them.

412
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:42,520
However, when you start including political people or people who are disliked by someone,

413
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:50,520
the incentives change and as a result what you see is a sort of a chimeric resource,

414
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,520
which is very high quality if it was going to describe hydraulic presses, let's say,

415
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,520
but very low quality when you have a controversial figure who's hated by a determined group.

416
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,520
So I think that it has morphed over our lifetime from being something

417
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,520
which is an astonishing achievement to something which is in fact very dangerous.

418
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,520
The other thing I would say is that we have a very strange situation

419
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,520
in that we expected that free speech was going to be the exchange of ideas with which we disagreed.

420
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:32,520
And instead it has morphed, I think, over my lifetime much more into a question of what can I get away with

421
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,520
that might not be true, it might not be a different point of view,

422
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,520
but it's simply a free speech exploit to destroy.

423
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
If I don't have a good argument against somebody's position,

424
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,520
I always have the ability to try to talk about that person's family or skin care or what have you.

425
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,520
And I think that for many of us we're sort of waking up to the idea

426
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,520
that a world saturated in speech without friction, which is what we now have,

427
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:05,520
you don't have to print a pamphlet or get a book deal in order to say your piece,

428
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:13,520
that in a cacophonous world, mostly what free speech produces is vitriol and personal attacks.

429
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,520
And I think that we're all sort of scratching our head, this isn't exactly the future that we had envisaged.

430
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,520
On the COVID pandemic, which we touched on earlier,

431
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,520
your brother Brett has become a very high profile part of this debate.

432
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,520
We've got a clip of him talking about it, listen to this.

433
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,520
I believe we must zoom out if we are to understand the pattern that we are gathered here to explore,

434
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,520
because the pattern is larger than federal health agencies and the COVID cartel.

435
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,520
If we do zoom out and ask what are they hiding, the answer becomes as obvious as it is disturbing.

436
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,520
They are hiding everything.

437
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,520
So that was to a Senate committee this week.

438
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,520
What did you make of your brother's appearance there?

439
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,520
What do you make of the general debate about COVID as it raged in real time?

440
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Well, first of all, I want to be very clear that whatever Brett's positions are on COVID are his positions.

441
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,520
They are not my positions, and I don't want to be referenced to his positions.

442
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Much of what he says is true, but the problem is that when you are so clearly lying about the origins of COVID,

443
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,520
its treatment, the reasons for doing things, the science, you open up the question,

444
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,520
what exactly is going on and why are we lying about everything?

445
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I think the stark difference is that Brett claims that he can figure out much more of that story than I think I can,

446
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,520
and I daresay I don't think anyone can.

447
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:54,520
If you're not going to really go after the EcoHealth Alliance and Peter Dajik in terms of the information

448
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:01,520
that that organization and that individual holds, and you're not going to discuss Ralph Berwick's lab in North Carolina,

449
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,520
you're not going to talk about the private communications inside of NIH with Francis Collins.

450
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:16,520
If you're not going to talk about Anthony Fauci's duties in terms of biowarfare after the Geneva and biowarfare conventions of the 1970s,

451
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:23,520
because presumably this is all about statecraft and the extremely secret programs as to why are we in Wuhan,

452
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,520
talking about inserting, if you're in Cleveland sites and humanizing coronavirus,

453
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:38,520
it's an absolutely terrifying vacuum of knowledge, and I don't think we know why.

454
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:46,520
I think that this, very likely, we're trying to play 12-dimensional chess and we're barely able to play checkers,

455
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,520
and this goes back to the original point about, I think it was April of 1953 when we figured out DNA,

456
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,520
and then 10 years later we had the genetic code with the work of Marshall Nirenberg.

457
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:03,520
It's so much power, and the treaties that we've signed are possibly nonsensical.

458
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,520
I mean, we have a problem that we don't develop offensive weapons,

459
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,520
but defensive measures can be easily converted to offensive measures.

460
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:18,520
We have put restrictions on ourselves that we then attempt to get out of.

461
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,520
Almost certainly this has to do with questions that we don't want resolved in public,

462
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,520
and I came from, you know, I'm an old man now.

463
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:37,520
At 58, I remember the church hearings, the pike hearings, the Watergate hearings, the Iran-Contra hearings.

464
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,520
We have given up on a taste for actually figuring out who we are, what we've done, what our responsibilities are,

465
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,520
and I think that we don't know. Brett may know. I don't think he does.

466
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,520
I know that I don't know, and the hearings were the way that we were going to figure this out,

467
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,520
and I don't think that we did that in a smart and aggressive fashion.

468
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
How do you think the pandemic began?

469
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,520
I don't know. It could be a wet market. It's very unlikely.

470
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:15,520
I think that the diffuse proposal that came out of the EcoHealth Alliance clearly suggests

471
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,520
that there's a whole lot of coincidence that was going on in Wuhan, China,

472
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,520
but I have to say that, you know, as somebody with a STEM PhD,

473
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,520
I'd like to restrict myself first to what I can say,

474
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,520
and what I can say is we're not trying to figure it out.

475
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,520
I can also say with absolute certainty that the claim coming out of places like the Lancet,

476
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:49,520
that any attempt to figure out the origin of COVID that considered the Wuhan Institute of Virology was necessarily racist,

477
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:58,520
was an abomination, the attempt to sign up Nobel laureates in order to make this seem like a respectable position.

478
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,520
What was it, like 60-plus Nobel laureates?

479
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,520
This is a great danger to science.

480
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:17,520
We cannot spend our credibility covering up for failures of statecraft and 12D chess at a geopolitical level.

481
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,520
I think we have to go back to a world in which we actually get answers,

482
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,520
and if we killed a bunch of people by helping the Chinese in their biological laboratories,

483
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:33,520
we're going to have to take responsibility that potentially tens of millions of people are dead through our stupidity.

484
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,520
During the pandemic, the science regularly changed as facts changed.

485
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,520
That struck me looking back on it as a perfectly normal sequence of events,

486
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,520
with a novel virus that that would happen.

487
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:54,520
I mean, are you sympathetic to the issues that scientists had

488
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,520
and to the fact that they did keep changing their mind about things,

489
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,520
from the efficacy of masks, for example, to whether if you had a vaccine you could transmit the virus and so on?

490
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Are you sympathetic to that's the fog of war when you're dealing with something like that?

491
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
No.

492
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,520
Really? You think it was willful, deliberate disinformation, knowing the facts?

493
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Look, I'm not a biologist, but again, that above 40 IQ keeps causing me problems.

494
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,520
This was obviously two separate things.

495
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,520
A small amount of revision in terms of our knowledge as we learned more

496
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,520
and a massive amount of revisions as our policy changed.

497
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,520
If you expended too much PPE personal protective equipment in a previous administration

498
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,520
and then you failed to follow the administrations of the literature,

499
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,520
which said that you had to be prepared for surges,

500
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,520
very sudden needs for a very large amount of PPE, for example.

501
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,520
It was very clear that we were being told that masks didn't work at the beginning in part

502
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,520
because we were trying to reserve them for people who were working in emergency rooms.

503
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,520
And then we decided that we needed these masks despite questions about the size of the virus

504
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,520
and the width of the mesh of the mask.

505
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,520
And then we go back and forth and back and forth.

506
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:31,520
This is a transparent situation in which we're pretending that our reasons for doing something

507
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,520
are given by some proxy.

508
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:41,520
I think that what we had was we didn't want to admit that we'd failed to replenish our stock under Obama.

509
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,520
I think we didn't want to admit that the masks weren't necessarily very efficacious.

510
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:53,520
We didn't really have great tools, and as such, we just looked like idiots.

511
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
And we couldn't ask questions, right?

512
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,520
If you look at, for example, the PhDs who are outside of the control of the university system

513
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,520
who weren't dependent on NIH grants, who are free, effectively, to ask questions,

514
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,520
we were supposed to be the representatives of ordinary Americans who wanted answers to these questions.

515
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
And we were all denigrated.

516
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,520
We were told that we were, I don't know, crazy people, conspiracy theorists, et cetera, et cetera.

517
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,520
You look at the trajectory of Jeffrey Sachs, who was put on this commission to investigate these things.

518
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,520
He appointed all of these people from inside the system,

519
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:39,520
and he realized that he'd hired wolves and foxes to guard hen houses.

520
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
This is a crazy situation.

521
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,520
We need to give our scientists FU money, and we need them to tell us the truth.

522
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
And I don't think it was that the science was changing.

523
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,520
I think that the idea is something terrible happened, and we weren't honest about it.

524
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,520
You have been called the new Einstein because you love maths and physics,

525
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
but also because you had the theory of relativity.

526
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,520
You have a theory of everything.

527
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,520
It's complex, the theory of everything, but what's the simple layman version of it?

528
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,520
The Einstein was, well, first of all, I mean, it's a very kind introduction.

529
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
I'm happy to just be myself.

530
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Effectively, that you're looking at something that's extraordinarily simple,

531
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,520
that Einstein's theory, if you will, began with four degrees of freedom,

532
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,520
which you can think of as any four degrees of freedom,

533
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,520
like treble, mid, bass, and reverb on an amp.

534
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Then what he did was he took the four degrees of freedom,

535
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,520
and he said, let's put three rulers and one watch as measuring devices

536
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,520
and six protractors to measure the angles between all of those four objects.

537
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,520
And he called that spacetime.

538
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,520
That spacetime object is not where I believe we live.

539
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,520
We actually live on top of all of those extra rulers, watches, and protractors,

540
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,520
and we are played back in this four-dimensional space.

541
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,520
So imagine that you have a record on a phonograph.

542
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,520
Imagine that that record was, in some sense, 14-dimensional data.

543
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,520
The stylus was Einstein's spacetime metric,

544
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,520
and the gramophone is the four-dimensional world that you perceive.

545
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,520
That is, in essence, where I believe we are.

546
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,520
I believe that we are looking at a 14-dimensional world.

547
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,520
Effectively, you think you're living in four dimensions,

548
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,520
but you're playing back a 14-dimensional world via Einstein's metric,

549
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
and you're getting confused.

550
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,520
How is it that you have Schrodinger's cat both dead and alive?

551
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Well, how is it that on the door's first album,

552
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,520
you have both break on through to the other side and light my fire,

553
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
but you don't hear them both at once?

554
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,520
You don't think of that as a paradox,

555
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:00,520
and I think that in part we have all of these crazy logjams

556
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,520
because we think we're living in a four-dimensional manifold.

557
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,520
So for people who are scientifically illiterate like me,

558
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,520
what is your plan to resolve this?

559
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,520
Sooner or later, the string theorists will retire and die,

560
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,520
and my desire is to outlive them.

561
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,520
Effectively, what you have is one group of very brilliant,

562
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,520
very smart people who refuse to follow scientific ethics.

563
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,520
They won't consider other people's work.

564
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
They name everything after themselves.

565
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,520
They absorb everything into their worldview,

566
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,520
and they've made science impossible

567
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,520
much the way biology was made impossible under COVID.

568
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,520
And what I thought I would do is I'd start a podcast.

569
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,520
I'd grow an enormous channel.

570
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I think I'm the mathematician with the largest following in the world.

571
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,520
And the entire point of that is to make sure

572
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
that they can't do to me what they did to me before,

573
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,520
which is to drown me out and use the official channels.

574
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
So I'll use the unofficial channels.

575
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,520
In fact, the Intellectual Dark Web came about because I'd spotted

576
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,520
that podcasts were far more powerful than anyone in traditional media had thought.

577
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,520
And so what I did was I tried to aggregate a few people with mega channels

578
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,520
and a lot of voices that needed amplification

579
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,520
and wrap a kind of a concept or a brand around it.

580
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Right now, the legacy media doesn't know why it's dying.

581
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,520
And what I intend to do is to use a large channel

582
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,520
to become even larger.

583
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,520
And apparently I jumped the gun a little bit.

584
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:44,520
I think that unfortunately this university system that holds back new ideas,

585
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:49,520
and I mean scientific ideas, and it is still too powerful.

586
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,520
This thing that we just saw with Claudine Gay, however, is a huge,

587
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,520
I don't know, it's a huge window of hope that's opening,

588
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,520
because if I had told you before that the president of Harvard

589
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,520
was completely unqualified for that office

590
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,520
and that that person might be a plagiarist,

591
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,520
that might have sounded completely fanciful.

592
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,520
You might have thought I was crazy.

593
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,520
Well, the fact that she lost her job for it

594
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,520
actually would have sounded crazy, because you would have thought that...

595
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,520
No, no, no, she still employed as a professor.

596
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Right, but she lost her job as the president of Harvard, right?

597
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,520
Absolutely, but what I'm trying to say is

598
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,520
when you find out how corrupt our universities are

599
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,520
and how much amazing work is still being done within them,

600
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,520
you'll be ready to listen to Geometric Unity, but you're not there yet.

601
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,520
Right now you're in the process of figuring out that Harvard isn't Harvard,

602
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,520
MIT isn't MIT, and I sure hope that Oxford and Cambridge are still themselves.

603
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,520
They have a little bit, a little longer in the tooth

604
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,520
and maybe a little bit more history under their belt,

605
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,520
but right now it's important to purge the universities

606
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,520
of everything related to diversity, equity, inclusion, plagiarism.

607
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,520
We need to get rid of a lot of these activist subjects

608
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,520
that were maybe founded with the best of intentions in the late 60s,

609
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,520
and we need to return to rigorous scholarship

610
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,520
and above all collegiality with enough money

611
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,520
that professors do not fear if they don't sign a loyalty oath.

612
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,520
They don't need to worry about walking to campus

613
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,520
that they're going to be, you know, attacked.

614
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,520
Right now what we need is something like a civil war in the universities

615
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
and the right side has to win.

616
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,520
You know, I realized we'd reached an absolute nadir with this

617
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,520
when a professor at an American university, I can't remember which one,

618
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,520
for 25 years had delivered a lecture about the use of offensive language

619
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,520
in modern society and as part of the lecture

620
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,520
he used examples of offensive language

621
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,520
and he was reported by students who couldn't handle this

622
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,520
and were triggered by it for using offensive language

623
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,520
and he was fired, even though the whole point of his lecture

624
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
for a quarter of a century had been

625
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,520
how you navigate the use of offensive language in society.

626
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,520
And at that point I realized we had literally lost our minds.

627
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,520
I mean, the idea that a university professor

628
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,520
would be hounded out of his job for giving a lecture about a subject

629
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,520
where the students had just willfully, deliberately misused

630
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,520
the use of the offensive language to get him out of his job

631
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,520
seemed to me extraordinary.

632
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,520
University is not kindergarten.

633
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:39,520
It is important to become intolerant of people who are not tolerant themselves.

634
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
That will sound like a paradox to some.

635
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
We have no time for that.

636
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,520
It is very important to restore collegiality, academic freedom, freedom of speech

637
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
and a lot of people don't belong in university

638
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,520
and we need to practice exclusion rather than inclusion in their case.

639
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,520
I don't know how to say this.

640
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,520
This idea, this vogue that we have for things that sound good but make no sense

641
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,520
has to be purged from the system by the adults.

642
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
Otherwise there will be no adults in the system.

643
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,520
I want to end very quickly, Eric.

644
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,520
I've got ten things.

645
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,520
I want to give you the opportunity to give me a statistical probability

646
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,520
of these things happening.

647
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
So you can choose any percentage you like, okay?

648
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,520
But you've got to answer quickly. It's rapid fire.

649
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
No, no, no. Yeah, I decline.

650
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
You can't do that?

651
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,520
No.

652
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,520
Really? Why?

653
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Because it's going to be extremely low quality.

654
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,520
I live on the internet and as, no, I'm quite serious.

655
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,520
There's a vogue for trying to get people to answer all questions.

656
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,520
I didn't particularly want to answer a question about my brother's views on COVID

657
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,520
because why?

658
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,520
I completely supported him with respect to Ivermectin

659
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,520
and the idea it wasn't horse to warmer,

660
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,520
but I completely disagreed with his Ivermectin maximalism.

661
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,520
And the internet can't maintain a distinction like that, you see.

662
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,520
In other words, to the Ivermectin army,

663
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,520
Brett was a genius for realizing that Ivermectin was a near perfect prophylactic,

664
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,520
which I didn't believe.

665
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,520
On the other hand, to people who were buying the official line,

666
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,520
I was killing people by suggesting that Ivermectin was a replacement.

667
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,520
So every time you ask a person to engage in such activities,

668
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,520
what happens is that that person's life turns to crap

669
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,520
because of the low quality people on the internet,

670
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,520
many of whom are bots probably, not even humans,

671
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,520
that dog you with everything that you say.

672
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,520
So the reason that I don't accept what you're saying

673
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,520
is that I don't want three weeks of pain in my life

674
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,520
that I'm an idiot for giving those probabilities.

675
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,520
That's actually a brilliant answer.

676
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Eric Weinstein, it's been a pleasure talking to you.

677
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Thank you very much.

678
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
I really enjoyed it, Pierce. Thanks for having me.

679
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,520
Thank you.
