00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Dr. Eric Weinstein is a Harvard-trained mathematician and a titan of the so-called

00:05.800 --> 00:11.760
Intellectual Dark Web. They're the big iconoclastic thinkers who span political divides to challenge

00:11.760 --> 00:18.720
mainstream narratives, stoking controversy and debate along the way. Dr. Weinstein tackles

00:18.720 --> 00:23.200
everything from Putin and Ukraine to globalization, and Jeffrey Epstein has become a superstar

00:23.200 --> 00:26.800
guest on the world's biggest podcast and streaming shows.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.640
You met Jeffrey Epstein.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.400
The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. There are people that you need in your dark

00:34.400 --> 00:37.960
hours. As soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.

00:37.960 --> 00:45.960
And now he goes uncensored. I'm always surprised when people with your kind of intellect wrestle

00:45.960 --> 00:52.280
with any kind of quandary about Russian dictator invading sovereign democratic country.

00:52.280 --> 00:57.480
International nations like Russia have concerns that don't have to do only with their exact

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
borders.

00:58.480 --> 01:03.400
I mean, do you think anyone like Putin who has 6,000 nuclear weapons at his disposal

01:03.400 --> 01:07.120
would want to start a war that would obliterate everything?

01:07.120 --> 01:11.360
And somebody, a pair of nunchucks, they're most likely to knock themselves out rather

01:11.360 --> 01:15.480
than to become Bruce Lee. We sit here with a ticking time bomb. We don't know how long

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
we have.

01:16.920 --> 01:23.560
The four most overrated things in life were lobster, champagne, anal sex, and picnics.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.480
I don't really know much about champagne. Perhaps the next question.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.280
Are there any limits to free speech?

01:30.280 --> 01:36.360
It has morphed more into a question of what can I get away with that might not be true?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.920
I've got 10 things. Rapid fire.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.520
No, no, no. Yeah, I decline. No, I'm quite serious.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.520
Eric Weisd, great to have you.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.520
Good to be with you.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.520
So I was just checking your Wikipedia a minute ago.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.520
And under education it said...

01:53.520 --> 01:55.520
It has a bitty face recently.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.520
Well, you can challenge this if you like, but under education it said Weinstein received

01:59.520 --> 02:06.520
his PhD in Mathematical Physics from Harvard University in 1992 in his dissertation Extension

02:06.520 --> 02:11.520
of Self-Duel Yang-Mills Equations Across the Eighth Dimension.

02:11.520 --> 02:16.520
Weinstein showed that the self-duel Yang-Mills Equations were not peculiar to Dimension 4

02:16.520 --> 02:19.520
and admitted generalizations to higher dimensions.

02:19.520 --> 02:24.520
And I realized at that point, having read that, Eric, that you and I were probably on

02:24.520 --> 02:30.520
slightly different intellectual pathways in our lives, and this might be quite a challenging encounter.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.520
You have a different theory about the Yang-Mills Equations.

02:34.520 --> 02:39.520
By the way, that's the most accurate thing I've heard in my Wikipedia entry sometimes.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.520
Maybe things are improving.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.520
I mean, look, obviously you've got a massive brain.

02:44.520 --> 02:49.520
Do you think that's been a force for good or for angst in your life?

02:51.520 --> 02:53.520
Yeah, I see evil isn't on the table.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.520
It can be. I avoided that.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:57.520 --> 03:03.520
I mean, to be honest, I hope it's inspiring to people with learning differences

03:03.520 --> 03:05.520
and neurodivergence everywhere.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.520
I was a terrible student in high school.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.520
So, to me, it's quite funny.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.520
I mean, I don't know what to say.

03:12.520 --> 03:17.520
It speaks to the triumph of will and the power of dyslexia.

03:17.520 --> 03:21.520
The intellectual dark web is its core.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.520
I've interviewed many people from Miss Douglas Murray, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson,

03:25.520 --> 03:27.520
Professor Stephen Pinker, and so on.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.520
And the common themes seem to be people who just decide that they're not going to accept

03:31.520 --> 03:36.520
everything that the mainstream media pumps out to the public.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.520
They want to challenge, you know, what I would call group think.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.520
They want to challenge tribalism, particularly fueled by social media.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.520
They just want to be, I guess, annoyingly curious and combative

03:48.520 --> 03:52.520
about stuff that we're told collectively we have to believe.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.520
I think it's a lot more than that.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.520
I mean, I never explained who was in it nor what it meant.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.520
So people try to wrap ideas around it.

04:03.520 --> 04:09.520
One of the reasons that it gained currency was that no one had a description for the fact

04:09.520 --> 04:15.520
that many smart people were not going along with the sort of intellectual hegemony

04:15.520 --> 04:20.520
of the mainstream, which should represent a huge diversity of viewpoints.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.520
But in fact, that's only honored in the breach.

04:23.520 --> 04:29.520
I think that one of the things that is not frequently thought about in terms of that project

04:29.520 --> 04:31.520
was the importance of civility.

04:31.520 --> 04:38.520
It's incredibly difficult to tease out our differences when we're yelling at each other,

04:38.520 --> 04:45.520
calling names, and in point of fact, I believe that we've lost the ability to have good fights.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.520
Our fights are terrible.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.520
I totally agree.

04:47.520 --> 04:54.520
We can't get good people to sit down because without intellectual Queensbury rules,

04:54.520 --> 04:56.520
all you get is eye gouging.

04:56.520 --> 05:02.520
And while there's a segment of the internet that's always looking for somebody to rip off an arm

05:02.520 --> 05:08.520
and lose a digit, most of us want to live to see another day and continue to develop our points

05:08.520 --> 05:11.520
and even concede when the other person has a better one.

05:11.520 --> 05:16.520
So the dirty little secret of the intellectual dark web is that even though we were across

05:16.520 --> 05:21.520
the political spectrum, we were pretty darn good to each other for a long time.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.520
And I think that that's the key to getting great fights.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.520
What I've noticed is that Ben Shapiro still has a pinned tweet.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.520
I think facts don't care about your feelings.

05:29.520 --> 05:38.520
And I've definitely noticed in debates that people go ad hominem very quickly and very abusively,

05:38.520 --> 05:45.520
normally to mask the fact that their actual argument is devoid of fact.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.520
Well, when you don't have a point, it's an excellent tactic.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.520
Where are we in the world right now, Eric?

05:52.520 --> 05:56.520
You've written and spoken so much about the state of the world,

05:56.520 --> 06:01.520
but I always say to people that if you actually look at it statistically,

06:01.520 --> 06:04.520
this is the best time to ever be alive.

06:04.520 --> 06:09.520
We're living longer, we're living healthier, there's less child poverty, there are fewer wars and so on and so on.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.520
By every conceivable metric, this is arguably the best time to ever be alive

06:14.520 --> 06:17.520
and yet so many people seem so angst ridden.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.520
Young people have an epidemic of anxiety.

06:20.520 --> 06:24.520
And a lot of people having real problems just dealing with life

06:24.520 --> 06:29.520
when in fact compared to all their ancestors, they've got it good.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.520
Why?

06:31.520 --> 06:36.520
Well, see, you've got to stop drinking with Steven Pinkler.

06:36.520 --> 06:40.520
It was actually him that said that, you're right.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.520
Well, this is a terrible idea that was spread by Steven Pinker.

06:45.520 --> 06:50.520
And what it is to borrow from my physics and math background

06:50.520 --> 06:54.520
is you can't understand the conservation of energy

06:54.520 --> 06:57.520
if you don't have terms for both potential and kinetic energy.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.520
So if you think about what you're talking about,

07:00.520 --> 07:04.520
you're talking about the cessation of all kinds of, in some sense, human kinetic energy

07:04.520 --> 07:09.520
from the early part of the 20th century with all of the two terrible wars,

07:09.520 --> 07:11.520
a horrible pandemic, et cetera.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.520
We don't see that much in the world.

07:14.520 --> 07:19.520
Only Mao's leap forward, I think, rises to that level of atrocity.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.520
So that has been a huge improvement.

07:21.520 --> 07:27.520
The problem is why that is the case, which is largely because in 1952-53,

07:27.520 --> 07:33.520
over six months, we acquired the secrets to both the atom and the cell.

07:33.520 --> 07:37.520
So with the first hydrogen bomb named Ivy Mike in the Pacific

07:37.520 --> 07:42.520
and Watson and Crick's elucidation of the double helix structure for nucleic acid,

07:42.520 --> 07:46.520
we became godlike in terms of our power.

07:46.520 --> 07:51.520
And as a result, we acquired the first time, for the first time,

07:51.520 --> 07:53.520
the ability to end the human project.

07:53.520 --> 07:58.520
And I think it's the loss of an indefinite human future that has to be restored

07:58.520 --> 08:00.520
and no one can figure out how to do it.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.520
So we sit here effectively with a ticking time bomb.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.520
We don't know how long we have.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.520
And things are very pleasant.

08:09.520 --> 08:15.520
I mean, you can sit in a coffee shop and have a perfectly good life,

08:15.520 --> 08:17.520
but you never know when the end is coming.

08:17.520 --> 08:23.520
Whereas in a previous era, you didn't know how often you were going to be conscripted into a war.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.520
But on the other hand, there was no chance of humans extinguishing themselves.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.520
So I think you really have to broaden that concept.

08:30.520 --> 08:37.520
And I would agree with you in terms of the realized terror that has engulfed the world.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.520
In fact, most of it is potential terror.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.520
Did you watch Oppenheim in the movie?

08:43.520 --> 08:44.520
Sure.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.520
What did you think of it?

08:46.520 --> 08:49.520
It's very tough.

08:49.520 --> 08:57.520
I don't think people remember that we have this power and that it was unleashed by science

08:57.520 --> 09:03.520
and in particular was unleashed by effectively my former colleagues.

09:03.520 --> 09:08.520
So that when you see a cameo appearance by Richard Feynman, let's say,

09:08.520 --> 09:12.520
or at least someone portraying him,

09:12.520 --> 09:19.520
you have to recognize that these are the people who unleashed the doomsday scenario.

09:19.520 --> 09:27.520
And for me, because we ceased exploding atmospheric nuclear weapons in 1962, I believe,

09:27.520 --> 09:33.520
we've really grown far too, I don't know how to say it,

09:33.520 --> 09:37.520
we're too unconcerned with the danger in which we live.

09:37.520 --> 09:42.520
And for me, it was an attempt to reawaken our self-knowledge

09:42.520 --> 09:46.520
and to remind ourselves how important science is,

09:46.520 --> 09:51.520
how currently we say that scientists are feeble, they don't live in the real world.

09:51.520 --> 09:57.520
I promise you, you'll be living in their world for the rest of time.

09:57.520 --> 10:03.520
This is very much the real world and it was painful in part, but it was a very intriguing film.

10:03.520 --> 10:08.520
When Vladimir Putin rattles his nuclear sabre,

10:08.520 --> 10:13.520
which he does regularly as a form of trying to intimidate the West in particular,

10:13.520 --> 10:20.520
do you think he means it? Do you think anyone like Putin, who has 6,000 nuclear weapons at his disposal,

10:20.520 --> 10:24.520
is ever, I don't know whether the stupid isn't the right word,

10:24.520 --> 10:32.520
is ever going to be in a position where he would want to start a war that would obliterate everything?

10:32.520 --> 10:35.520
You can ask the same of us.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.520
Yeah.

10:37.520 --> 10:42.520
I'm quite serious.

10:42.520 --> 10:49.520
In terms of a cultural difference, the Russians regularly use nuclear explosions for engineering purposes.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.520
They have a comfort with nuclear weapons that we lack.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.520
I think that many Americans do not really understand the cultural difference

10:56.520 --> 11:03.520
between Central and Eastern Europe and the modern West, which is frankly terrifying.

11:04.520 --> 11:11.520
I see cross-cultural miscommunication as a potential start to a nuclear scenario.

11:11.520 --> 11:15.520
As we've seen from the Cold War, there have been many situations in which,

11:15.520 --> 11:21.520
if there's a glitch in a system and you believe that somebody is firing upon you,

11:21.520 --> 11:24.520
that you're forced to make a very tough decision.

11:24.520 --> 11:29.520
Quite honestly, humans are just not good enough to play this kind of game theory.

11:29.520 --> 11:34.520
And remember that with the Cold War, it was basically a bipolar conflict.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.520
You're about to move to multi-polar game theory,

11:37.520 --> 11:41.520
and I can assure you that it's a much less stable scenario

11:41.520 --> 11:44.520
where you're trying to figure out what eight different players are doing

11:44.520 --> 11:49.520
with regional conflicts and unannounced nuclear powers entering the fray.

11:49.520 --> 11:55.520
Do you worry more about nuclear Armageddon or AI becoming sentient?

11:56.520 --> 12:03.520
I worry about people trying to make AI a more pressing problem than nuclear weapons.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.520
A lot of the cool kids in Silicon Valley have developed a meme,

12:06.520 --> 12:10.520
which is that, oh, AI is far more dangerous than nukes.

12:10.520 --> 12:16.520
And that may be in the long run, but at the moment, it's not even close.

12:16.520 --> 12:20.520
However, it feels kind of passe to worry about nuclear weapons.

12:20.520 --> 12:27.520
Five years ago or so, I think I started publicly calling for rare atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons,

12:27.520 --> 12:34.520
because I think the greatest danger at the moment is that fear of nuclear weapons is seen as out of vogue,

12:34.520 --> 12:39.520
and we have to reacquaint our viscera with the danger in which we live.

12:39.520 --> 12:44.520
I mean, I did the last interview with Professor Stephen Hawking before he sadly died,

12:44.520 --> 12:46.520
and I asked him what's the biggest threat to mankind,

12:46.520 --> 12:49.520
and he said when artificial intelligence learns to self-design,

12:49.520 --> 12:53.520
the implication being that when it does, the first thing it would do

12:53.520 --> 12:59.520
is probably conclude that humans are completely pointless and irrational and useless in many cases,

12:59.520 --> 13:01.520
and they just get rid of us.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.520
I don't think that's his best work.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.520
Really? You're not as concerned?

13:11.520 --> 13:15.520
Well, in the long run, I think that it's a huge concern,

13:15.520 --> 13:18.520
but if you look at what large language models are

13:18.520 --> 13:24.520
and how quickly humans have confused large language models for general intelligence,

13:24.520 --> 13:28.520
it tells you that maybe more humans need to spend time coding

13:28.520 --> 13:33.520
and understanding the transformer architecture which enabled this recent mini-revolution.

13:33.520 --> 13:39.520
I mean, it's absolutely astounding, but mostly what these machines are doing are feeding us back to us,

13:39.520 --> 13:43.520
and once they've read all our books and read all our papers,

13:43.520 --> 13:49.520
it's easily possible that this model and this architecture may plateau.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.520
But isn't it the same kind of situation with nuclear weapons

13:53.520 --> 14:01.520
where in decent hands, supposedly decent hands of people who have a moral code,

14:01.520 --> 14:04.520
a code of ethics who don't want to do the wrong thing,

14:04.520 --> 14:08.520
nuclear weapons can be controlled and can be safe,

14:08.520 --> 14:14.520
but in nefarious hands from people with evil intent, they become incredibly dangerous.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.520
And I would say it's the same argument with AI, isn't it?

14:19.520 --> 14:23.520
I don't agree with the premise, so maybe ask that to someone else.

14:23.520 --> 14:29.520
I believe that if you take ten very moral people and very intelligent people

14:29.520 --> 14:32.520
and you give them all nuclear weapons and the ability to annihilate each other,

14:32.520 --> 14:35.520
you can play all sorts of game-theoretic experiments

14:35.520 --> 14:42.520
and find that we're simply not wise enough to solve coordination problems and signaling problems.

14:42.520 --> 14:48.520
I just don't agree with this idea that it's our morality and our intellect

14:48.520 --> 14:50.520
which makes nuclear weapons dangerous.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.520
It is simply the power.

14:52.520 --> 14:57.520
It's like handing a lightsaber to somebody in a Star Wars film

14:57.520 --> 15:04.520
and watching them learn by slicing off a leg and an arm within the first five minutes.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.520
Hand somebody a pair of nunchucks.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.520
They're most likely to knock themselves out rather than to become Bruce Lee.

15:10.520 --> 15:15.520
Yeah, but if you have Mother Teresa with a finger on the nuclear button and Adolf Hitler,

15:15.520 --> 15:19.520
the chances are more likely that it'll be the bad guy that presses it.

15:21.520 --> 15:28.520
You took two people, one is much worse than the other, but those aren't my favorites.

15:28.520 --> 15:33.520
Mother Teresa, we don't need to reliticate the Christopher Hitchens point.

15:33.520 --> 15:43.520
I would say that I just don't know of these good people who can steward nuclear weapons.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.520
It's simply too much power.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.520
Or if you think about it in terms of systems,

15:49.520 --> 15:56.520
a democracy is capable of having a string of 10 moral ethical leaders

15:56.520 --> 15:59.520
and then it gets itself into a period of distress

15:59.520 --> 16:02.520
and suddenly it elects somebody who's completely unfit for the office.

16:02.520 --> 16:07.520
We don't have the ability to live with this amount of leverage.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.520
I had a good relationship with Christopher Hitchens.

16:09.520 --> 16:13.520
I employed him actually as a columnist when I was editor for Daily Mirror

16:13.520 --> 16:16.520
and he once sent me one of my favorite emails ever, which was he said,

16:16.520 --> 16:23.520
the four most overrated things in life were lobster, champagne, anal sex and picnics.

16:24.520 --> 16:32.520
I don't really know much about champagne and some of the other items on your list

16:32.520 --> 16:35.520
don't appeal to me for this conversation, perhaps the next question.

16:37.520 --> 16:42.520
One of your big thoughts is that western institutions, including politicians,

16:42.520 --> 16:46.520
scientists and media, are actively lying to us

16:46.520 --> 16:51.520
and we've seen this exacerbated by things like the pandemic,

16:51.520 --> 16:56.520
like modern warfare and all the propaganda that flies around it.

16:56.520 --> 17:01.520
How much of your belief that they're lying to us is driven by,

17:01.520 --> 17:05.520
I guess, the social media element of this,

17:05.520 --> 17:10.520
where everything is amplified in real time to the public in a way it never used to be.

17:10.520 --> 17:16.520
In other words, information used to flow to us in a far slower and more controlled way

17:16.520 --> 17:20.520
whereas now everything is coming out as 24-7 in real time.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.520
Well, you know, I hold an unpopular view,

17:27.520 --> 17:34.520
which is that public-spirited fictions are essential to proper governance.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.520
The problem isn't that they're lying to us,

17:37.520 --> 17:43.520
the problem is that the lies are not public-spirited, they are not competent,

17:43.520 --> 17:48.520
they're not adult-level fictions and they're not minimal.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.520
You want to lie as little as possible.

17:50.520 --> 17:54.520
A French philosopher once said that a nation is a collection of people

17:54.520 --> 17:57.520
that have agreed to forget something in common.

17:57.520 --> 18:01.520
So in part, you know, if you were to resolve the contradictions,

18:01.520 --> 18:04.520
let's say, in the United States First Amendment,

18:04.520 --> 18:08.520
you might find that you had no constitution.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.520
The problem is the nature of the lies

18:11.520 --> 18:15.520
and they are not adult-level and I don't mean to boast on your program,

18:15.520 --> 18:18.520
but I have an IQ above 40, so I find this really distressing

18:18.520 --> 18:25.520
that I'm constantly asked to believe things that no child should be asked to believe.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.520
I mean, you tweeted the other day about Ukraine and Putin.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.520
I can't tell you my position on US strategy in Ukraine.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.520
If I don't know more, all I know is that in a democracy,

18:34.520 --> 18:39.520
I'm being lied to and pressured to support something I don't sufficiently understand.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.520
That's it. I mean, you could take that argument in 1939

18:43.520 --> 18:45.520
and say, you know, when Hitler invaded Poland,

18:45.520 --> 18:47.520
I don't know enough about it.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.520
I haven't been told enough about it by my government.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.520
Therefore, I can't take a position about Adolf Hitler.

18:53.520 --> 18:58.520
I would say that what Putin is doing in Ukraine is not dissimilar, actually,

18:58.520 --> 19:01.520
and that his aspirations may not be quite as heinous

19:01.520 --> 19:05.520
in terms of global domination as Hitler.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.520
But I would say his aspirations are heinous.

19:08.520 --> 19:13.520
And I'm always surprised when people with your kind of intellect

19:13.520 --> 19:17.520
wrestle with any kind of quandary about Russian dictator

19:17.520 --> 19:21.520
invading sovereign democratic country and murdering loads of people

19:21.520 --> 19:23.520
and helping himself to loads of land

19:23.520 --> 19:27.520
and why that shouldn't be in everyone's interest to repel.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.520
Well, I would like to think that's because you misunderstand my position.

19:31.520 --> 19:35.520
But it could be a failure of intellect on my part.

19:35.520 --> 19:40.520
We're in a very long-running post-Cold War strategy

19:40.520 --> 19:47.520
where in 1999, I believe we extended Article 5 NATO status to Poland,

19:47.520 --> 19:52.520
which was not former Soviet Union but was Warsaw Pact.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.520
I didn't have a problem at that point.

19:54.520 --> 19:59.520
I think it was in 2004 where we extended Article 5 status

19:59.520 --> 20:01.520
to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

20:01.520 --> 20:07.520
And at that point, I clearly felt that I didn't understand what we were doing.

20:07.520 --> 20:14.520
I believe that, you know, Riga is within a thousand miles or kilometer,

20:14.520 --> 20:16.520
I don't even know, of Moscow.

20:16.520 --> 20:21.520
And, you know, because the Cuban Missile Crisis was very much top of mind

20:21.520 --> 20:25.520
during the part of the Cold War that I saw and its aftermath,

20:25.520 --> 20:29.520
I very well remember the concept of American spheres of influence.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.520
The Cuba was not considered a sovereign nation that could choose to do whatever it wanted

20:33.520 --> 20:35.520
because it was simply too close to the United States.

20:35.520 --> 20:43.520
I think that, in part, it's the desire to only put on one pair of glasses,

20:43.520 --> 20:45.520
one set of lenses.

20:45.520 --> 20:51.520
The sovereign nation lens clearly suggests that Putin is a madman

20:51.520 --> 20:57.520
and his crossing of the border of Ukraine, it's a slam dunk.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.520
So, it's not that I don't understand your point,

21:00.520 --> 21:04.520
but then, again, there's another set of glasses, which is the spheres of influence glasses.

21:04.520 --> 21:10.520
And that says that, in fact, powerful nations like Russia have concerns

21:10.520 --> 21:13.520
that don't have to do only with their exact borders.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.520
And if you look, for example, at a time lapse of the borders in central-eastern Europe,

21:17.520 --> 21:20.520
you'll notice that they've been fluid for forever.

21:20.520 --> 21:25.520
If every time there is a border readjustment, we go to the brink of nuclear war,

21:25.520 --> 21:27.520
that's game over.

21:27.520 --> 21:32.520
Furthermore, there are very complicated relations in central and eastern Europe.

21:32.520 --> 21:38.520
And I don't think that Americans are particularly adept at discussing them,

21:38.520 --> 21:44.520
forcing us to say Slava Ukraine as a slogan.

21:44.520 --> 21:49.520
We're not allowed to say glory to anything, but we're supposed to be 100% on board.

21:49.520 --> 21:54.520
This is a long-running, statecraft-level narrative.

21:54.520 --> 21:59.520
Clearly, there was an idea in place as far back as the fall of the Berlin Wall.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.520
I don't understand what the strategy is.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.520
It might be the right strategy.

22:03.520 --> 22:08.520
I'm certainly not supporting Putin, who's an absolute brutal thug.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.520
That's not in question.

22:09.520 --> 22:14.520
The problem is, is that we are now the stewards of a thermonuclear planet.

22:14.520 --> 22:21.520
And the simple application of an idea that he crossed the border of a sovereign nation

22:21.520 --> 22:25.520
after everything we've been doing in Ukraine and all the games that we've played,

22:25.520 --> 22:28.520
I don't think that this really makes sense.

22:28.520 --> 22:35.520
And the problem, as I understand it, is that we keep telling the audience, the electorate, if you will,

22:35.520 --> 22:40.520
that these incredibly simplistic lenses with which we choose to view everything

22:40.520 --> 22:43.520
are sufficient to actually form grown-up opinions, and they aren't.

22:43.520 --> 22:49.520
I mean, the irony, of course, is that if Ukraine had not been encouraged to give up its nuclear defence,

22:49.520 --> 22:55.520
then Putin is highly unlikely to have invaded it.

22:55.520 --> 23:03.520
There are so many choices that we have made in terms of how we've handled the post-Cold War

23:03.520 --> 23:08.520
former Soviet Union countries and Warsaw Pact countries.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.520
I think you have to understand that this is part of a long-running grand strategy,

23:13.520 --> 23:16.520
and it's not shared with me.

23:16.520 --> 23:24.520
I'm not even positive that today's State Department officials are really 100% in...

23:24.520 --> 23:28.520
that they have good knowledge of what this extended plan is.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.520
Very often what you find is that the architects of a multi-decade plan die

23:32.520 --> 23:36.520
and they don't teach their successors what the actual strategy was.

23:36.520 --> 23:41.520
When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, did you think it was right

23:41.520 --> 23:49.520
that American boots were put on the ground to kick him out, given it wasn't a NATO country?

23:49.520 --> 23:55.520
Kuwait, in some sense, is in part created as a block

23:55.520 --> 24:02.520
so that Iraq would have the tiniest sea front.

24:02.520 --> 24:11.520
The creation, in some sense, of states by colonial powers or accidents of history...

24:11.520 --> 24:17.520
I think the problem here is that Saddam Hussein was an absolute brute,

24:17.520 --> 24:22.520
but he was a brute in a region in which one has to become brutish.

24:22.520 --> 24:27.520
It is astounding the extent to which many Iraqis who were relatively middle class

24:27.520 --> 24:33.520
and knew the difficulties of governing in that region viewed him as an absolute brute,

24:33.520 --> 24:38.520
but were appreciative of his efforts of keeping Iraq relatively secular.

24:38.520 --> 24:42.520
That's not to say that I'm a Saddam Hussein supporter far from it.

24:42.520 --> 24:48.520
It's just to say that we keep communicating very strange things into these regions.

24:48.520 --> 24:55.520
For example, when I think it was George Herbert Walker Bush who told the Marsh Arabs in the south of Iraq

24:55.520 --> 25:00.520
and then got them slaughtered, we have to be very careful in our communications

25:00.520 --> 25:04.520
in incredibly different regions from our own.

25:04.520 --> 25:11.520
Do you think it's really in America's national interest that Vladimir Putin could win in Ukraine,

25:11.520 --> 25:20.520
could just seize a vast chunk of that country and claim it as Russian, as he did with Crimea

25:20.520 --> 25:23.520
and it's, of course, after he voted Georgia as well?

25:23.520 --> 25:28.520
Do you think it's in America's national interest that a Russian dictator expands the power

25:28.520 --> 25:33.520
and geographical land of Russia?

25:33.520 --> 25:42.520
No. No, no, no. I very much don't want Vladimir Putin to taste victory.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.520
I don't want him to try to reassemble the former Soviet Union.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.520
So how do you stop him?

25:49.520 --> 25:54.520
Well, in part, you might want to cooperate.

25:54.520 --> 26:03.520
You might have wanted to have cooperated with him more and it's very difficult.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.520
Look, my family comes from the region.

26:07.520 --> 26:14.520
Almost 100% of my ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Ukraine and Latvia.

26:15.520 --> 26:20.520
I'm very hesitant to talk in Western media about the realities of the region

26:20.520 --> 26:26.520
because I don't think that Americans have been prepared for quite what the pressures are in this area

26:26.520 --> 26:32.520
and it is incredibly important that we understand just how dangerous this region is,

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
in part because of the skill level of the players.

26:34.520 --> 26:40.520
Vladimir Putin may be a brute, a butcher, but he's also incredibly skilled.

26:40.520 --> 26:47.520
You have to remember that America's nuclear power effectively came from a bunch of emigres from places like Lvov,

26:47.520 --> 26:53.520
which is now called Lviv, which I think it was a Polish city, which is now claimed to be Ukrainian.

26:53.520 --> 27:01.520
We have to appreciate that this is a region that is incredibly skilled, incredibly dangerous,

27:01.520 --> 27:08.520
a source of intellectual horsepower which built America's own atomic arsenal, refugees from the area.

27:08.520 --> 27:13.520
So I think that you just have to understand that most of us are way out of our depths

27:13.520 --> 27:20.520
if we don't have great information, we don't have cultural and historical understanding of the tensions between these people.

27:20.520 --> 27:24.520
I want to just change tack to free speech.

27:24.520 --> 27:29.520
In your estimation, are there any limits to free speech?

27:29.520 --> 27:36.520
Well, it depends. People say free markets and there are all sorts of limits on free markets.

27:36.520 --> 27:41.520
Usually when we say free speech, adults know the limits. You know that there are libel limits.

27:41.520 --> 27:48.520
There's Brandenburg versus Ohio. There are all sorts of things that you can't say or do.

27:48.520 --> 27:57.520
We have export controls. In fact, in physics, there's a concept called restricted data

27:57.520 --> 28:02.520
where if you have an idea and you're not a federal employee and you don't have a security clearance,

28:02.520 --> 28:11.520
if the idea touches nuclear weapons, you may not share it at all because it is born secret.

28:11.520 --> 28:15.520
There are huge limits on speech that are part of free speech.

28:15.520 --> 28:23.520
So when we say free speech, I'm 100% for free speech, but that is an understanding that that's a reserved term of art.

28:23.520 --> 28:30.520
It's not unrestricted speech. It has never been. It can't exist as such.

28:30.520 --> 28:36.520
You and I think are both big fans of Elon Musk. I had an interview with him at the start of the year

28:36.520 --> 28:43.520
which he unceremoniously cancelled when he found a clip of me on the show mildly criticising his decision

28:43.520 --> 28:48.520
to let Alex Jones back onto X having previously said he would never let him back on

28:48.520 --> 28:53.520
and he wouldn't let people who stand on the graves of dead children on the platform.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.520
I thought he was wrong to change his mind about Alex Jones, but I found it quite ironic

28:57.520 --> 29:06.520
that Elon, who is a constant promoter of free speech, particularly on X, would not want to engage in an interview with me

29:06.520 --> 29:10.520
because I criticised him over something like that.

29:10.520 --> 29:16.520
Well, you know, everyone wants to date free speech, but when free speech wants to date other people,

29:16.520 --> 29:23.520
we always have second thoughts and I'd like to think that I'm at least self-aware enough to realise

29:23.520 --> 29:31.520
that most of the things that we stand up for, truth, ethics, free speech, etc., when they bind on us,

29:31.520 --> 29:36.520
we as humans are very likely to change our mind. That's why we try to enshrine this in law.

29:36.520 --> 29:42.520
It's sort of a Ulysses contract that I know that I'm going to be against free speech when it's used in a way that I don't like.

29:42.520 --> 29:48.520
I bristled when you said you read my Wikipedia entry because I have idiots who constantly try to deface it.

29:49.520 --> 29:53.520
On the other hand, because I'm locked into a free speech mentality,

29:53.520 --> 29:58.520
it stays my hand when I try to say that that's something that shouldn't be permitted.

29:58.520 --> 30:05.520
Effectively, I have to put up with the empowerment of idiots and dangerous ones at that

30:05.520 --> 30:09.520
if I'm really signed up for the free speech project and, you know, there you have it.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.520
It was interesting on Wikipedia. I mean, my eldest son noticed, I don't know if you know if it's still there,

30:13.520 --> 30:17.520
if I never look at it, but it said that I was the youngest of four children

30:17.520 --> 30:22.520
and I happened to be the oldest of four children. So it's a tiny little fact.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.520
It doesn't matter to anybody other than it's wrong.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.520
So my eldest son as a journalist corrected it.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.520
And then whoever it was who put the erroneous information up there,

30:32.520 --> 30:37.520
re-corrected it back to the false one. And this went on and on and on and on,

30:37.520 --> 30:39.520
and there was no end to it.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.520
Where my eldest son kept saying I was the eldest.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.520
And whoever this person was kept saying I was the youngest.

30:46.520 --> 30:51.520
And all it showed me was that Wikipedia professes to be, you know,

30:51.520 --> 30:57.520
a great vehicle for information, accurate information about people and so on and free speech and so on.

30:57.520 --> 31:02.520
But there's not much it can do if someone is utterly determined to put disinformation out there.

31:02.520 --> 31:05.520
Well, it was briefly a great resource.

31:05.520 --> 31:09.520
The problem that we find is it had certain flaws.

31:09.520 --> 31:12.520
When you had rules about, you know, authoritative sources,

31:12.520 --> 31:16.520
and sources were in fact largely authoritative, it worked well.

31:16.520 --> 31:21.520
As you've seen the degradation of authoritative sources and as people become more sophisticated

31:21.520 --> 31:26.520
about what kinds of exploits work on Wikipedia, you have a very dangerous situation,

31:26.520 --> 31:30.520
which is that technical articles continue to be of fairly high quality

31:30.520 --> 31:34.520
because there's no one determined to graffiti over them.

31:34.520 --> 31:42.520
However, when you start including political people or people who are disliked by someone,

31:42.520 --> 31:50.520
the incentives change and as a result what you see is a sort of a chimeric resource,

31:50.520 --> 31:55.520
which is very high quality if it was going to describe hydraulic presses, let's say,

31:55.520 --> 32:01.520
but very low quality when you have a controversial figure who's hated by a determined group.

32:01.520 --> 32:06.520
So I think that it has morphed over our lifetime from being something

32:06.520 --> 32:12.520
which is an astonishing achievement to something which is in fact very dangerous.

32:12.520 --> 32:18.520
The other thing I would say is that we have a very strange situation

32:18.520 --> 32:24.520
in that we expected that free speech was going to be the exchange of ideas with which we disagreed.

32:24.520 --> 32:32.520
And instead it has morphed, I think, over my lifetime much more into a question of what can I get away with

32:32.520 --> 32:37.520
that might not be true, it might not be a different point of view,

32:37.520 --> 32:42.520
but it's simply a free speech exploit to destroy.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.520
If I don't have a good argument against somebody's position,

32:44.520 --> 32:50.520
I always have the ability to try to talk about that person's family or skin care or what have you.

32:50.520 --> 32:55.520
And I think that for many of us we're sort of waking up to the idea

32:55.520 --> 33:00.520
that a world saturated in speech without friction, which is what we now have,

33:00.520 --> 33:05.520
you don't have to print a pamphlet or get a book deal in order to say your piece,

33:05.520 --> 33:13.520
that in a cacophonous world, mostly what free speech produces is vitriol and personal attacks.

33:13.520 --> 33:18.520
And I think that we're all sort of scratching our head, this isn't exactly the future that we had envisaged.

33:18.520 --> 33:23.520
On the COVID pandemic, which we touched on earlier,

33:23.520 --> 33:28.520
your brother Brett has become a very high profile part of this debate.

33:28.520 --> 33:31.520
We've got a clip of him talking about it, listen to this.

33:31.520 --> 33:36.520
I believe we must zoom out if we are to understand the pattern that we are gathered here to explore,

33:36.520 --> 33:41.520
because the pattern is larger than federal health agencies and the COVID cartel.

33:41.520 --> 33:47.520
If we do zoom out and ask what are they hiding, the answer becomes as obvious as it is disturbing.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.520
They are hiding everything.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.520
So that was to a Senate committee this week.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.520
What did you make of your brother's appearance there?

33:56.520 --> 34:01.520
What do you make of the general debate about COVID as it raged in real time?

34:01.520 --> 34:08.520
Well, first of all, I want to be very clear that whatever Brett's positions are on COVID are his positions.

34:08.520 --> 34:13.520
They are not my positions, and I don't want to be referenced to his positions.

34:13.520 --> 34:24.520
Much of what he says is true, but the problem is that when you are so clearly lying about the origins of COVID,

34:24.520 --> 34:30.520
its treatment, the reasons for doing things, the science, you open up the question,

34:30.520 --> 34:34.520
what exactly is going on and why are we lying about everything?

34:35.520 --> 34:43.520
I think the stark difference is that Brett claims that he can figure out much more of that story than I think I can,

34:43.520 --> 34:46.520
and I daresay I don't think anyone can.

34:46.520 --> 34:54.520
If you're not going to really go after the EcoHealth Alliance and Peter Dajik in terms of the information

34:54.520 --> 35:01.520
that that organization and that individual holds, and you're not going to discuss Ralph Berwick's lab in North Carolina,

35:01.520 --> 35:06.520
you're not going to talk about the private communications inside of NIH with Francis Collins.

35:06.520 --> 35:16.520
If you're not going to talk about Anthony Fauci's duties in terms of biowarfare after the Geneva and biowarfare conventions of the 1970s,

35:16.520 --> 35:23.520
because presumably this is all about statecraft and the extremely secret programs as to why are we in Wuhan,

35:24.520 --> 35:29.520
talking about inserting, if you're in Cleveland sites and humanizing coronavirus,

35:30.520 --> 35:38.520
it's an absolutely terrifying vacuum of knowledge, and I don't think we know why.

35:38.520 --> 35:46.520
I think that this, very likely, we're trying to play 12-dimensional chess and we're barely able to play checkers,

35:46.520 --> 35:52.520
and this goes back to the original point about, I think it was April of 1953 when we figured out DNA,

35:52.520 --> 35:56.520
and then 10 years later we had the genetic code with the work of Marshall Nirenberg.

35:56.520 --> 36:03.520
It's so much power, and the treaties that we've signed are possibly nonsensical.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.520
I mean, we have a problem that we don't develop offensive weapons,

36:07.520 --> 36:12.520
but defensive measures can be easily converted to offensive measures.

36:12.520 --> 36:18.520
We have put restrictions on ourselves that we then attempt to get out of.

36:18.520 --> 36:25.520
Almost certainly this has to do with questions that we don't want resolved in public,

36:25.520 --> 36:29.520
and I came from, you know, I'm an old man now.

36:29.520 --> 36:37.520
At 58, I remember the church hearings, the pike hearings, the Watergate hearings, the Iran-Contra hearings.

36:37.520 --> 36:45.520
We have given up on a taste for actually figuring out who we are, what we've done, what our responsibilities are,

36:45.520 --> 36:50.520
and I think that we don't know. Brett may know. I don't think he does.

36:50.520 --> 36:55.520
I know that I don't know, and the hearings were the way that we were going to figure this out,

36:55.520 --> 36:59.520
and I don't think that we did that in a smart and aggressive fashion.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.520
How do you think the pandemic began?

37:04.520 --> 37:08.520
I don't know. It could be a wet market. It's very unlikely.

37:08.520 --> 37:15.520
I think that the diffuse proposal that came out of the EcoHealth Alliance clearly suggests

37:15.520 --> 37:19.520
that there's a whole lot of coincidence that was going on in Wuhan, China,

37:19.520 --> 37:25.520
but I have to say that, you know, as somebody with a STEM PhD,

37:25.520 --> 37:30.520
I'd like to restrict myself first to what I can say,

37:30.520 --> 37:33.520
and what I can say is we're not trying to figure it out.

37:33.520 --> 37:40.520
I can also say with absolute certainty that the claim coming out of places like the Lancet,

37:40.520 --> 37:49.520
that any attempt to figure out the origin of COVID that considered the Wuhan Institute of Virology was necessarily racist,

37:49.520 --> 37:58.520
was an abomination, the attempt to sign up Nobel laureates in order to make this seem like a respectable position.

37:58.520 --> 38:03.520
What was it, like 60-plus Nobel laureates?

38:03.520 --> 38:06.520
This is a great danger to science.

38:06.520 --> 38:17.520
We cannot spend our credibility covering up for failures of statecraft and 12D chess at a geopolitical level.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.520
I think we have to go back to a world in which we actually get answers,

38:20.520 --> 38:26.520
and if we killed a bunch of people by helping the Chinese in their biological laboratories,

38:26.520 --> 38:33.520
we're going to have to take responsibility that potentially tens of millions of people are dead through our stupidity.

38:33.520 --> 38:38.520
During the pandemic, the science regularly changed as facts changed.

38:38.520 --> 38:43.520
That struck me looking back on it as a perfectly normal sequence of events,

38:43.520 --> 38:47.520
with a novel virus that that would happen.

38:48.520 --> 38:54.520
I mean, are you sympathetic to the issues that scientists had

38:54.520 --> 38:57.520
and to the fact that they did keep changing their mind about things,

38:57.520 --> 39:03.520
from the efficacy of masks, for example, to whether if you had a vaccine you could transmit the virus and so on?

39:03.520 --> 39:09.520
Are you sympathetic to that's the fog of war when you're dealing with something like that?

39:09.520 --> 39:11.520
No.

39:12.520 --> 39:18.520
Really? You think it was willful, deliberate disinformation, knowing the facts?

39:18.520 --> 39:26.520
Look, I'm not a biologist, but again, that above 40 IQ keeps causing me problems.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.520
This was obviously two separate things.

39:30.520 --> 39:35.520
A small amount of revision in terms of our knowledge as we learned more

39:35.520 --> 39:41.520
and a massive amount of revisions as our policy changed.

39:41.520 --> 39:47.520
If you expended too much PPE personal protective equipment in a previous administration

39:47.520 --> 39:51.520
and then you failed to follow the administrations of the literature,

39:51.520 --> 39:55.520
which said that you had to be prepared for surges,

39:55.520 --> 40:00.520
very sudden needs for a very large amount of PPE, for example.

40:00.520 --> 40:05.520
It was very clear that we were being told that masks didn't work at the beginning in part

40:05.520 --> 40:10.520
because we were trying to reserve them for people who were working in emergency rooms.

40:10.520 --> 40:17.520
And then we decided that we needed these masks despite questions about the size of the virus

40:17.520 --> 40:21.520
and the width of the mesh of the mask.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.520
And then we go back and forth and back and forth.

40:24.520 --> 40:31.520
This is a transparent situation in which we're pretending that our reasons for doing something

40:31.520 --> 40:34.520
are given by some proxy.

40:34.520 --> 40:41.520
I think that what we had was we didn't want to admit that we'd failed to replenish our stock under Obama.

40:41.520 --> 40:46.520
I think we didn't want to admit that the masks weren't necessarily very efficacious.

40:46.520 --> 40:53.520
We didn't really have great tools, and as such, we just looked like idiots.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.520
And we couldn't ask questions, right?

40:55.520 --> 41:02.520
If you look at, for example, the PhDs who are outside of the control of the university system

41:02.520 --> 41:07.520
who weren't dependent on NIH grants, who are free, effectively, to ask questions,

41:07.520 --> 41:13.520
we were supposed to be the representatives of ordinary Americans who wanted answers to these questions.

41:13.520 --> 41:15.520
And we were all denigrated.

41:15.520 --> 41:21.520
We were told that we were, I don't know, crazy people, conspiracy theorists, et cetera, et cetera.

41:21.520 --> 41:28.520
You look at the trajectory of Jeffrey Sachs, who was put on this commission to investigate these things.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.520
He appointed all of these people from inside the system,

41:31.520 --> 41:39.520
and he realized that he'd hired wolves and foxes to guard hen houses.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.520
This is a crazy situation.

41:41.520 --> 41:48.520
We need to give our scientists FU money, and we need them to tell us the truth.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.520
And I don't think it was that the science was changing.

41:50.520 --> 41:55.520
I think that the idea is something terrible happened, and we weren't honest about it.

41:55.520 --> 42:00.520
You have been called the new Einstein because you love maths and physics,

42:00.520 --> 42:02.520
but also because you had the theory of relativity.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.520
You have a theory of everything.

42:05.520 --> 42:12.520
It's complex, the theory of everything, but what's the simple layman version of it?

42:12.520 --> 42:17.520
The Einstein was, well, first of all, I mean, it's a very kind introduction.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.520
I'm happy to just be myself.

42:19.520 --> 42:24.520
Effectively, that you're looking at something that's extraordinarily simple,

42:24.520 --> 42:28.520
that Einstein's theory, if you will, began with four degrees of freedom,

42:28.520 --> 42:31.520
which you can think of as any four degrees of freedom,

42:31.520 --> 42:34.520
like treble, mid, bass, and reverb on an amp.

42:34.520 --> 42:38.520
Then what he did was he took the four degrees of freedom,

42:38.520 --> 42:43.520
and he said, let's put three rulers and one watch as measuring devices

42:43.520 --> 42:49.520
and six protractors to measure the angles between all of those four objects.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.520
And he called that spacetime.

42:52.520 --> 42:57.520
That spacetime object is not where I believe we live.

42:57.520 --> 43:04.520
We actually live on top of all of those extra rulers, watches, and protractors,

43:04.520 --> 43:07.520
and we are played back in this four-dimensional space.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.520
So imagine that you have a record on a phonograph.

43:10.520 --> 43:14.520
Imagine that that record was, in some sense, 14-dimensional data.

43:14.520 --> 43:18.520
The stylus was Einstein's spacetime metric,

43:18.520 --> 43:22.520
and the gramophone is the four-dimensional world that you perceive.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.520
That is, in essence, where I believe we are.

43:25.520 --> 43:30.520
I believe that we are looking at a 14-dimensional world.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.520
Effectively, you think you're living in four dimensions,

43:33.520 --> 43:38.520
but you're playing back a 14-dimensional world via Einstein's metric,

43:38.520 --> 43:39.520
and you're getting confused.

43:39.520 --> 43:44.520
How is it that you have Schrodinger's cat both dead and alive?

43:44.520 --> 43:47.520
Well, how is it that on the door's first album,

43:47.520 --> 43:50.520
you have both break on through to the other side and light my fire,

43:50.520 --> 43:52.520
but you don't hear them both at once?

43:52.520 --> 43:54.520
You don't think of that as a paradox,

43:54.520 --> 44:00.520
and I think that in part we have all of these crazy logjams

44:00.520 --> 44:03.520
because we think we're living in a four-dimensional manifold.

44:03.520 --> 44:07.520
So for people who are scientifically illiterate like me,

44:07.520 --> 44:10.520
what is your plan to resolve this?

44:13.520 --> 44:18.520
Sooner or later, the string theorists will retire and die,

44:18.520 --> 44:23.520
and my desire is to outlive them.

44:23.520 --> 44:27.520
Effectively, what you have is one group of very brilliant,

44:27.520 --> 44:32.520
very smart people who refuse to follow scientific ethics.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.520
They won't consider other people's work.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.520
They name everything after themselves.

44:36.520 --> 44:40.520
They absorb everything into their worldview,

44:40.520 --> 44:42.520
and they've made science impossible

44:42.520 --> 44:45.520
much the way biology was made impossible under COVID.

44:45.520 --> 44:49.520
And what I thought I would do is I'd start a podcast.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.520
I'd grow an enormous channel.

44:50.520 --> 44:54.520
I think I'm the mathematician with the largest following in the world.

44:54.520 --> 44:58.520
And the entire point of that is to make sure

44:58.520 --> 45:00.520
that they can't do to me what they did to me before,

45:00.520 --> 45:04.520
which is to drown me out and use the official channels.

45:04.520 --> 45:05.520
So I'll use the unofficial channels.

45:05.520 --> 45:09.520
In fact, the Intellectual Dark Web came about because I'd spotted

45:09.520 --> 45:14.520
that podcasts were far more powerful than anyone in traditional media had thought.

45:14.520 --> 45:19.520
And so what I did was I tried to aggregate a few people with mega channels

45:19.520 --> 45:21.520
and a lot of voices that needed amplification

45:21.520 --> 45:25.520
and wrap a kind of a concept or a brand around it.

45:25.520 --> 45:29.520
Right now, the legacy media doesn't know why it's dying.

45:29.520 --> 45:34.520
And what I intend to do is to use a large channel

45:34.520 --> 45:36.520
to become even larger.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.520
And apparently I jumped the gun a little bit.

45:38.520 --> 45:44.520
I think that unfortunately this university system that holds back new ideas,

45:44.520 --> 45:49.520
and I mean scientific ideas, and it is still too powerful.

45:49.520 --> 45:53.520
This thing that we just saw with Claudine Gay, however, is a huge,

45:53.520 --> 45:56.520
I don't know, it's a huge window of hope that's opening,

45:56.520 --> 46:00.520
because if I had told you before that the president of Harvard

46:00.520 --> 46:03.520
was completely unqualified for that office

46:03.520 --> 46:06.520
and that that person might be a plagiarist,

46:06.520 --> 46:09.520
that might have sounded completely fanciful.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.520
You might have thought I was crazy.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.520
Well, the fact that she lost her job for it

46:14.520 --> 46:17.520
actually would have sounded crazy, because you would have thought that...

46:17.520 --> 46:21.520
No, no, no, she still employed as a professor.

46:21.520 --> 46:24.520
Right, but she lost her job as the president of Harvard, right?

46:24.520 --> 46:27.520
Absolutely, but what I'm trying to say is

46:27.520 --> 46:33.520
when you find out how corrupt our universities are

46:33.520 --> 46:38.520
and how much amazing work is still being done within them,

46:38.520 --> 46:42.520
you'll be ready to listen to Geometric Unity, but you're not there yet.

46:42.520 --> 46:46.520
Right now you're in the process of figuring out that Harvard isn't Harvard,

46:46.520 --> 46:51.520
MIT isn't MIT, and I sure hope that Oxford and Cambridge are still themselves.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.520
They have a little bit, a little longer in the tooth

46:54.520 --> 46:56.520
and maybe a little bit more history under their belt,

46:56.520 --> 46:58.520
but right now it's important to purge the universities

46:58.520 --> 47:03.520
of everything related to diversity, equity, inclusion, plagiarism.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.520
We need to get rid of a lot of these activist subjects

47:06.520 --> 47:10.520
that were maybe founded with the best of intentions in the late 60s,

47:10.520 --> 47:12.520
and we need to return to rigorous scholarship

47:12.520 --> 47:15.520
and above all collegiality with enough money

47:15.520 --> 47:20.520
that professors do not fear if they don't sign a loyalty oath.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.520
They don't need to worry about walking to campus

47:22.520 --> 47:25.520
that they're going to be, you know, attacked.

47:25.520 --> 47:29.520
Right now what we need is something like a civil war in the universities

47:29.520 --> 47:31.520
and the right side has to win.

47:31.520 --> 47:35.520
You know, I realized we'd reached an absolute nadir with this

47:35.520 --> 47:38.520
when a professor at an American university, I can't remember which one,

47:38.520 --> 47:43.520
for 25 years had delivered a lecture about the use of offensive language

47:43.520 --> 47:46.520
in modern society and as part of the lecture

47:46.520 --> 47:49.520
he used examples of offensive language

47:49.520 --> 47:53.520
and he was reported by students who couldn't handle this

47:53.520 --> 47:56.520
and were triggered by it for using offensive language

47:56.520 --> 47:59.520
and he was fired, even though the whole point of his lecture

47:59.520 --> 48:01.520
for a quarter of a century had been

48:01.520 --> 48:04.520
how you navigate the use of offensive language in society.

48:04.520 --> 48:08.520
And at that point I realized we had literally lost our minds.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.520
I mean, the idea that a university professor

48:10.520 --> 48:14.520
would be hounded out of his job for giving a lecture about a subject

48:14.520 --> 48:20.520
where the students had just willfully, deliberately misused

48:20.520 --> 48:23.520
the use of the offensive language to get him out of his job

48:23.520 --> 48:26.520
seemed to me extraordinary.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.520
University is not kindergarten.

48:32.520 --> 48:39.520
It is important to become intolerant of people who are not tolerant themselves.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.520
That will sound like a paradox to some.

48:41.520 --> 48:43.520
We have no time for that.

48:43.520 --> 48:48.520
It is very important to restore collegiality, academic freedom, freedom of speech

48:48.520 --> 48:51.520
and a lot of people don't belong in university

48:51.520 --> 48:56.520
and we need to practice exclusion rather than inclusion in their case.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.520
I don't know how to say this.

48:58.520 --> 49:02.520
This idea, this vogue that we have for things that sound good but make no sense

49:02.520 --> 49:05.520
has to be purged from the system by the adults.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.520
Otherwise there will be no adults in the system.

49:07.520 --> 49:10.520
I want to end very quickly, Eric.

49:10.520 --> 49:12.520
I've got ten things.

49:12.520 --> 49:16.520
I want to give you the opportunity to give me a statistical probability

49:16.520 --> 49:18.520
of these things happening.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.520
So you can choose any percentage you like, okay?

49:20.520 --> 49:22.520
But you've got to answer quickly. It's rapid fire.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.520
No, no, no. Yeah, I decline.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.520
You can't do that?

49:26.520 --> 49:27.520
No.

49:27.520 --> 49:28.520
Really? Why?

49:28.520 --> 49:31.520
Because it's going to be extremely low quality.

49:31.520 --> 49:35.520
I live on the internet and as, no, I'm quite serious.

49:35.520 --> 49:39.520
There's a vogue for trying to get people to answer all questions.

49:39.520 --> 49:43.520
I didn't particularly want to answer a question about my brother's views on COVID

49:43.520 --> 49:44.520
because why?

49:44.520 --> 49:48.520
I completely supported him with respect to Ivermectin

49:48.520 --> 49:51.520
and the idea it wasn't horse to warmer,

49:51.520 --> 49:55.520
but I completely disagreed with his Ivermectin maximalism.

49:55.520 --> 49:58.520
And the internet can't maintain a distinction like that, you see.

49:58.520 --> 50:01.520
In other words, to the Ivermectin army,

50:01.520 --> 50:06.520
Brett was a genius for realizing that Ivermectin was a near perfect prophylactic,

50:06.520 --> 50:08.520
which I didn't believe.

50:08.520 --> 50:11.520
On the other hand, to people who were buying the official line,

50:11.520 --> 50:16.520
I was killing people by suggesting that Ivermectin was a replacement.

50:16.520 --> 50:20.520
So every time you ask a person to engage in such activities,

50:20.520 --> 50:24.520
what happens is that that person's life turns to crap

50:24.520 --> 50:26.520
because of the low quality people on the internet,

50:26.520 --> 50:29.520
many of whom are bots probably, not even humans,

50:29.520 --> 50:31.520
that dog you with everything that you say.

50:31.520 --> 50:34.520
So the reason that I don't accept what you're saying

50:34.520 --> 50:37.520
is that I don't want three weeks of pain in my life

50:37.520 --> 50:40.520
that I'm an idiot for giving those probabilities.

50:41.520 --> 50:44.520
That's actually a brilliant answer.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.520
Eric Weinstein, it's been a pleasure talking to you.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.520
Thank you very much.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.520
I really enjoyed it, Pierce. Thanks for having me.

50:49.520 --> 50:50.520
Thank you.
