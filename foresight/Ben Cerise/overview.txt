Checking Ben Cerise/Install Floor Trusses Yourself.txt
 It seems like you're referencing a phrase that might be from a song, a meme, or a piece of humor related to the construction industry. The phrase "That's how you dump trusses" is repeated to emphasize a particular method or way of removing trusses (which are triangular frames used in roof construction) from a structure. This could be a humorous take on the repetitive nature of work in construction, or it could be an inside joke among people who work with trusses. The phrase itself doesn't have much context without additional information, but it's likely related to the process of dismantling or removing these trusses safely and efficiently.
