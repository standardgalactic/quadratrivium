 Certainly! Thomas Cook and Mark Wallace are hosting today's webinar on the "Business Case for Semantic Web Ontology and Knowledge Graph." Cambridge Semantics, the company they are associated with, was founded over ten years ago and has established offices in both Boston and San Diego. The founders of Cambridge Semantics have a background with IBM's Advanced Internet Research division, which has provided them with a strong foundation in cutting-edge technological research and development.

The purpose of the webinar is to explore the importance of semantic web ontologies and knowledge graphs, particularly from a business perspective. These technologies are crucial for improving data integration, enabling better decision-making, and enhancing the value derived from data across various industries. Mark Wallace will guide participants through the key points and practical applications of these technologies.
