Thank you for joining today's webinar, the Business Case for Semantic Web Ontology and
Knowledge Graph.
My name is Thomas Cook, and I'm joined here today by Mark Wallace, who will be leading
you through today's webinar.
Thank you for joining.
Next slide, please.
Just to share a little bit about Cambridge Semantics, we were founded a little over ten
years ago.
We have offices in Boston and San Diego, and our founders came out of IBM's advanced
internet research.
