00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
30 years ago today Lucasfilm released a graphic adventure that would change the landscape

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,680
of adventure games forever and usher in a golden age for the genre.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,800
That game was the secret of Monkey Island.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,440
Today we'll hear from some of the team that created the game and find out the story behind

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
its development.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm on a retro tip and this is the making of Monkey Island.

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:01:02,000
This video will make some assumptions, not the least of which being that you have played

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,400
the game.

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,840
This isn't an analysis of the game itself, but rather a look at how it came to be, how

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,960
it was created and by whom.

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,000
Before we get to the secret of Monkey Island, it's important to understand the birth and

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,520
development of adventure games prior to 1990.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,880
So a brief history is in order.

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,760
The genre itself and indeed the very name adventure game dates back to Colossal Cave

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,000
Adventure, first released in 1976.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This went by several names including simply adventure.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,760
In these early days adventure games were what became known as text adventures.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,800
The player is presented with small paragraphs of text outlining the story and its developments

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,320
and the player responds by entering simple one or two word commands.

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,960
Text adventures became very popular in the late 70s and early 80s, but it wasn't until

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,920
1980 that they became graphic adventures when Sierra Online, then known as online systems,

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,440
released Mystery House for the Apple II.

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,800
This was the first ever graphic adventure and, albeit primitive line drawings, depicted

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,520
an adventure game visually for the first time.

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,080
This was the birth of the graphic adventure game.

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Obviously, technological advancements throughout the 1980s allowed these images to become more

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,200
and more detailed, but these adventure games still had one monumental flaw.

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,080
They still used command line interfaces relying on the player to input commands in text.

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,640
The text passes could be rather frustrating because they only recognized a set number

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,120
of commands, many or all of which would be unknown to the player at the outset.

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,680
The next significant leap for the genre came in 1984, again from Sierra, with the release

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,680
of the first King's Quest.

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,520
This was essentially a hybrid of graphic and text adventure.

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,760
The images on screen were now animated and the player could move the protagonist around

35
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,160
the screen without typing commands, but the majority of the game was still controlled

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,200
using text-based commands.

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,920
King's Quest saw a slew of sequels in the coming years, and some other very successful

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,120
entries in the Quest series, including Police Quest and Space Quest.

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,800
In 1986, Lucasfilm Games threw their hat into the arena with the release of their first

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,160
adventure game, Labyrinth.

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,720
Based on the Jim Henson film of the same name, it sought to sidestep some of the frustration

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,240
that came with these rigid command line interfaces.

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,760
David Fox at Lucasfilm developed a system using two word wheels, from which the player

44
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
could select from lists of available commands and interactive objects, thus creating an

45
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,560
instruction for the character.

46
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,080
This was far from ideal, but it was a huge step in the right direction, as it eliminated

47
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,880
the guesswork synonymous with text-based adventure games.

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,520
The next adventure from Lucasfilm Games, Maniac Mansion, came the following year.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,880
Created by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, Maniac Mansion completely flipped the adventure

50
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,920
game genre command interface on its head by introducing SCUM, or Script Creation Utility,

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,040
for Maniac Mansion.

52
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,600
This gave the player a selection of available commands, like walk to, pick up, open and

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,440
close.

54
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,360
These commands could be selected, and then used to interact with objects or characters

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,400
by clicking on them.

56
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,920
This was a revolutionary step forward for the way adventure games would be played.

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,080
This interface was obviously far more suited to a mouse, and even by 1987 they weren't

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
standard.

59
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,400
It wasn't until the PC port of Maniac Mansion that the real advantage of having a mouse

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,800
became apparent.

61
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,880
Lucasfilm Games followed the success of Maniac Mansion in 1988, with their second SCUM game

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Zack McCracken and the Alien Mindbenders.

63
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,880
The interface was very similar, although slightly improved, but even at this early stage Lucasfilm

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,840
were already establishing their style.

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,360
Their next two graphic adventures were 1989's Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, The Graphic

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,480
Adventure and 1990's Loom.

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,520
We'll hear more about Loom shortly.

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,160
And to understand how the secret of Monkey Island was conceived, we first need to understand

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,160
a bit more about Lucasfilm Games, and of course, meet the team who would create it.

70
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,080
Lucasfilm Games was a subdivision of Lucasfilm founded in 1982.

71
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,280
It began making original games for Atari, and all of its games were brought to market

72
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,680
by external publishers.

73
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,000
It wasn't until 1987's Maniac Mansion that Lucasfilm Games first self-published.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,280
The company was small, certainly by today's standards.

75
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,400
In fact, that had been George Lucas's only instruction to the studio early on.

76
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,920
Stay small and don't lose any money.

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,160
The team that would work on the secret of Monkey Island were Ron Gilbert, the Concepts

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,880
creator, he also did design and programming.

79
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,240
Ron had previously done programming for a few of Lucasfilm's games, but most notably

80
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,880
designed and wrote Maniac Mansion, conceptualized Zack McCracken, and did design for the indie

81
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,400
and The Last Crusade graphic adventure.

82
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,120
Ron brought in two fledgling programmers to assist with the programming design and overall

83
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,920
story, Dave Grossman and Tim Schaefer.

84
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,280
They had both recently started at Lucasfilm, being hired in 1989 as Scumlitz, who would

85
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,520
help implement the designer's ideas within the Scum engine.

86
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,560
They had assisted with bits and pieces for some prior games, but the secret of Monkey

87
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,200
Island would be their first proper project.

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,320
The art team was made up of Steve Purcell, a cartoonist, notably the creator of Sam and

89
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Max, who began at Lucasfilm Games in 1988.

90
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,680
He did artwork and graphics for the Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade graphic adventure,

91
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
graphics for the action game, artwork for Pipedream, and did character design and animations

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,880
for Loom.

93
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,040
He'd also designed the cover art for two games, Zack McCracken and Pipedream.

94
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,640
Mark Ferrari, an illustrator who had done art and animation for Zack McCracken, artwork

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,800
for Pipedream, and did all the background art for Loom.

96
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,200
Mike Ebert, another illustrator slash comic book artist, he started at Lucasfilm in 1989

97
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,560
and did actor art for the NES port of Maniac Mansion, artwork for Pipedream, and artwork

98
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,440
and graphics for The Last Crusade graphic adventure.

99
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,600
And Martin Bucky Cameron, who had previously done background art for Zack McCracken, graphics

100
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,920
and artwork for the indie graphic adventure, and had worked on a few other Lucasfilm games.

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,760
Steve Purcell, Mark Ferrari and Mike Ebert would be responsible for Monkey Island's

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,720
background art, and Steve, Mike and Martin Cameron would do its animations.

103
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
The art department was overseen by Gary Winnick, who had co-created Maniac Mansion with Ron

104
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Gilbert.

105
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,560
He didn't work on Monkey Island directly, but oversaw the development as a whole.

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,000
The other notable team member was Michael Land, who began his Lucasfilm games career

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,200
in 1990 as their first in-house composer.

108
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,040
Prior to this, Lucasfilm had mostly outsourced the soundtracks for their games.

109
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,640
Of course, several other Lucasfilm games employees no doubt contributed towards the development

110
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,320
of Monkey Island, as was the norm at the company.

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,000
People often did a bit of everything, and it was common for employees outside of a games

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,920
development team to lend a hand where needed.

113
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,480
Quite a mixture of personalities here, most of the art team were illustrators or artists

114
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,960
outside of the world of gaming, and two of the game's lead designers, Dave Grossman

115
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:15,080
and Tim Schaffer, had never taken on such a role before.

116
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,280
Ron Gilbert first came up with the pirate theme for The Secret of Monkey Island as one of

117
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,280
several ideas for adventure game projects after developing Maniac Mansion.

118
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Well, I had finished working on Maniac Mansion, and I was kind of thinking about another project.

119
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:41,960
And I came up with a few ideas that really never went anywhere, just ideas, and I wrote

120
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,200
down one page, and it was very common back at Lucasfilm at the time that people would

121
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,160
write little one-page design documents and then pass them around the office, and people

122
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,160
would comment on them and give feedback, and you'd sit down and chat with people, and

123
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,000
I did this for, I don't know, maybe probably three or four ideas post-Maniac Mansion,

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,200
and nothing really gained a lot of traction, and nothing was really super exciting.

125
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:20,320
And I was really kind of thinking about games like King's Quest, and you had a fantasy environment,

126
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,880
which was very popular back then, and it is today. Fantasy is a huge kind of genre in

127
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,680
games, and King's Quest kind of had this fantasy genre, and I started thinking about, well,

128
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,560
I wonder if that is one of the things that kind of makes it so successful, but I'm not

129
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:48,240
a big fantasy fan, and I didn't really want to make a game about dragons and such, and

130
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,480
I started thinking about, started thinking about them more, and that's really where things

131
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:03,280
like Pirates came up, because Pirates actually share a lot in common with fantasy, and I

132
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,480
thought, well, maybe if I did a game about pirates, I could kind of do fantasy without

133
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,240
actually doing fantasy, which I didn't really like, and so that's really where the whole

134
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,280
idea of pirates kind of sprung up, was from bad idea.

135
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,480
At this early stage, the project was known as Mutiny on Monkey Island. Looking at this

136
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,760
early design document, it had only vague similarities with the final game.

137
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,000
There were probably two major influences that just happened to, just by coincidence, you'll

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,760
read the book on Stranger Tides, which Tim Powers wrote, and that book was like this

139
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,600
real kind of eye-opener for me, because in that book, there were two things that kind

140
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,320
of made everything that I was thinking about for Monkey Island really click, and one was

141
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,880
that the protagonist in the story was kind of a fish out of water a little bit, right?

142
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,400
He was not a seasoned pirate. He doesn't really understand this world that he's in.

143
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,080
That made a lot of sense to me, and a lot of stuff with Monkey Island really clicked at that

144
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,720
point, because that's when I started thinking about, you know, the player is really in that

145
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,240
situation too, right? The player is not a seasoned pirate, and so it's really nice to be able to

146
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,800
push this, you know, protagonist into the world that doesn't know what's going on,

147
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,160
because the player doesn't know what's going on, and so they can both learn at the same time,

148
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,320
you know, about what it is to be a pirate, and that was so much so that the, I mean, the very

149
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,520
beginning line of Monkey Island is, you know, my name is Gavrish Supad, and I want to be a pirate.

150
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,240
I mean, he just states right at the beginning of the game, I don't know anything about this,

151
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,680
so that was like a big inspiration for me, you know, from kind of a story standpoint,

152
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,800
and the other was really the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, you know, I'd always loved that

153
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,160
ride as a kid, and there's just this feeling to that ride, especially at the very beginning.

154
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,200
At the beginning of the ride, you know, it's very slow, and there's lots of blues, and it's

155
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,000
nighttime, and I think you're in the Louisiana Bayou, and I just, I just, I love that kind of

156
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,520
environment a lot. In 1989, while developing the concept, Ron wrote an article called,

157
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Why Adventure Games Suck. This outlined the adventure game tropes that he wanted to avoid

158
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,640
while making this new game. These included, end objective needs to be clear, the player must

159
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,240
have a sense of what they're trying to accomplish, and why. Live and learn, no deaths. Backwards

160
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,200
puzzles, avoid giving the player the solution before presenting the problem. I forgot to pick it up,

161
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,760
ensure that essential items can't be made unobtainable if forgotten earlier.

162
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
Puzzles should advance the story, and puzzles need to make sense.

163
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,920
And give the player options. These rules would allow the team to veer away from many of the

164
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,880
gameplay aspects common to graphic adventures that had led gamers to become rather frustrated with

165
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,600
the genre. Well, with Miniac Mansion, you know, we, we dropped the parser, right? That was the

166
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,480
thing I hated the most about Sierra games was the typing, right? I really, I mean, the first thing

167
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,960
it really intrigued me about the Sierra games before, you know, I had done Miniac Mansion was

168
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,200
just that they were graphic adventures, right? I had played adventure games from like Infocom,

169
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,920
and, you know, even back in my university days, you know, the original adventure stuff, and I

170
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,120
played those, and I really enjoyed those. And I was very intrigued by, by Sierra, because these

171
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,320
things felt graphical, and they weren't, they weren't graphics like, Oh, well, here's a static

172
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,280
picture, right? They were, they were graphics in terms of, you know, the guy would actually

173
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,280
walk around and you move him around and things were animated. And I was really intrigued by that.

174
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,640
But I really did not like the parser, which was kind of where Miniac Mansion came from,

175
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,320
and the whole, you know, scum interface, you know, ditching the parser. So that was one thing I

176
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,120
didn't really like. The other thing that I didn't like, and I really hadn't kind of formulated

177
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,280
this idea until after Indiana Jones, but was the death part of it. You know, the Sierra games

178
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,600
really seemed to revel in death, right? It was, it was something that the game would actually

179
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,160
chastise you for. And I always felt like the designers of those games actually took pleasure,

180
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,800
you know, in setting up a situation where the, you know, where the player would, you know,

181
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,840
would actually die. And there were lots of places in Miniac Mansion where the player could die and

182
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,520
you can get into no win situations and kind of post Indiana Jones. I really thought, you know,

183
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,720
I don't think the player should be able to die. You know, you should not be able to get into bad

184
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,120
situations where you're constantly having to save the game because you're afraid you're going to

185
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,080
make a mistake with Monkey Island, you know, at least to some degree, probably mostly, you know,

186
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:30,400
I kind of fixed that issue with that game. I found for my personal taste that that was

187
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,840
always overdone, that the deaths were too arbitrary. You couldn't see them coming. You would have felt

188
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:43,840
like, like in Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones game, the one was built before I got there, you could

189
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,400
die, but it always felt like you earned it. You know, you lost a fight or something, because

190
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,240
there were reasons why you were dying. Whereas in the Sierra game, you would just, you know,

191
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,240
sort of accidentally click too far on the heart and you would walk into traffic and be run over by

192
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,720
accident. So that was sort of the, I think, the big philosophical difference between us. And we

193
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,760
would go out of our way to ensure that we didn't break the fantasy that never killed you off.

194
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:20,960
Ron assembled a team to work on this new project.

195
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,880
We had hired some more kind of programmers, and, you know, people like Steve Purcell had done a

196
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,960
lot of the art for, for the Indiana Jones game. And so, you know, I was familiar with him by working

197
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,400
on that. And we had also hired some new programmers to work in the scum system. I think there were

198
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,560
four of them that we had hired. You know, it kind of had that pool of people to really choose from,

199
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,800
you know, in terms of programmers. And, you know, Steve was kind of a natural, because we didn't

200
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,680
really have another project going on. So, you know, that's when Steve came on. And then Mark

201
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,440
Ferrari, who did all the art for Loom. So that's kind of, you know, I think how the team kind of

202
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,000
emerged. So at some point, Ron Gilbert came in and took Tim Schaefer and I aside and said,

203
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,080
look, I'm a game about pirates. And I want you guys to work on it with me, what do you say?

204
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,720
And we said, sure. So what else are we going to say? Of course he said yes. And that's how I

205
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:28,080
wound up on Gone Monkey, which was my first real, real game. I did background art for Zach McCracken

206
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,560
in using the EGA palette, using solid fields of color for the EGA palette. The next game,

207
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:44,240
the next major game that I did was Loom, which was done in Dithered EGA. Loom won a lot of awards

208
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,040
because of the way it looked and the way it looked was directly and almost entirely because we were

209
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:55,200
now using Dithered EGA color instead of solid fields of EGA color. And I believe that the next

210
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,040
major game I worked on after that was Secret of Monkey Island. I was already there at the company

211
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,360
where I had been creating some creature designs for a game that was canceled shortly after I got

212
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,880
there. They discovered I could paint and hired me to do the Zach McCracken cover. From that,

213
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,120
I was going to start on Monkey Island, but we all got shifted on to Indiana Jones and the

214
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,040
Last Crusade first. I don't remember Ron ever seeking me out. I was part of the small bullpin

215
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,200
that got assigned to whatever was happening next. The environment at Lucasfilm Games seemed

216
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,640
idyllic. The freedom that the development teams were afforded was significant and the setting

217
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,040
was picturesque to say the least. In those days, Lucasfilm Games was based at Skywalker Ranch

218
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,520
in California, a beautiful working environment close to the rest of Lucasfilm. I would drive up

219
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,400
to the Skywalker Ranch from Oakland, roll into the gates, maybe start the fireplace in the stable

220
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,880
house at the back of the ranch where our offices were. Settle in and start drawing into Luck's

221
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,080
paint. I can't remember if we would have teen check-ins every day. Gary Winnick was the head

222
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,600
of the art department, so I'm sure we would update with him at some point. At lunch, we'd walk over

223
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,960
to the main house, a big white Victorian house where they served an amazing lunch in a gorgeous

224
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,400
dining room with an NC Wyeth painting hanging above the fireplace. After that, Gary would say,

225
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,080
work or walk? We would usually choose to do a circuit of the ranch down to the farm area and

226
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,480
back past Skywalker Sound, which looks like a winery and past Lake Ewok. Sometimes we get

227
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,640
more ambitious and hike up into the hills surrounding the ranch. In the afternoons,

228
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,080
we'd labor at our desks and joke around as we worked. I'm sure Ron would come down and do

229
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,920
check-ins and let us know what was needed or coming soon. Late in the day, we would start playing one

230
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,560
of Larry Holland's World War II games. You could hear the little airplane motor buzz through the

231
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,640
cheesy PC speakers. If we goofed around too much during the day, we might stay late or there might

232
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,720
be a screening in the Art Deco Stagg Theater at Skywalker Sound. Once, on an after-lunch hike,

233
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,840
the artist decided to venture up for a look at George Lucas' observatory. He had built it to

234
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,680
house a telescope that someone had given him as a gift. On the way, we found a giant wooden spool

235
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,360
that power companies use to transport long lengths of cabling. We rolled the spool all the way to

236
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,960
the top of the hill overlooking Skywalker Ranch and let it go. It went careening all the way down

237
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,880
the hill and kicked up enough momentum to plow through a fence. Dorks that we were, we ran away

238
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,960
and never spoke of it. The location wasn't the only liberating aspect of Luke's film games.

239
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,640
The company's ethos was also very relaxed, allowing the development teams to shine creatively,

240
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,880
free from deadlines and money hungry executives. And Ron Gilbert applied that same spirit when

241
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,680
leading the Monkey Island team. I didn't realize how much freedom we had until later when I had to

242
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,000
have other jobs. We weren't responsible for keeping the company afloat. We were a tiny division of a

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,320
great big media empire that had lots of movie money and special effects money and sound production

244
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:16,320
money coming in. And it wasn't until a few years in that anybody even suggested that we

245
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,760
should make a profit. But I don't remember anybody specifically saying, you need to do this.

246
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,680
It was more, you know, we were all at 20 something and we were going into what we were doing.

247
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,840
Ron had a sense of what he wanted, but he was flexible enough to allow creative people to

248
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,360
contribute. To lead a project, you have to find out how to point everyone toward the same goal

249
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,560
and then give them the room to invest themselves in it. People do better work when they feel their

250
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,760
contributions are valued. The result is stronger when the lead can let the creative team flourish.

251
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,480
Although each team member had their role, a lot of the work on Monkey Island was a collaborative

252
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,000
effort, as was common at Luke's film games. Brainstorming sessions were common and ideas

253
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,480
were often bounced around. Working on the game and I was designing stuff and just really reacting

254
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,920
kind of to what we had seen implemented and going, oh, well, that's really interesting. Let's do more

255
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:24,480
of that. First of all, it was a new industry. Nobody had decided at that point what this was

256
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,440
about or what this should be about or where it was going. So everybody was in experimental

257
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,640
mode. Even the investors were in experimental mode in those days. So the fact that all the answers

258
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,880
hadn't been nailed down and everything that hadn't been nailed down hadn't been excluded

259
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,240
left a great deal of wiggle room that is no longer well, that hasn't been there until recently.

260
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,760
So our teams were six to a dozen people. Everybody knew everybody. Everybody was in contact and

261
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,720
talking and involved all day long and everybody was involved in all the discussions there were.

262
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,320
Everybody talked about game design. I mean, yes, we were each there to specialize in some part of

263
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,760
the game making process. A couple of us were there to do art and that was our area of expertise.

264
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,080
A couple of us there were there to do programming or game design and that was their area of expertise.

265
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,280
But everybody got together numerous times a day to talk about the art and the game design and puzzles

266
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:33,280
and dialogue and, you know, I mean, there wasn't anything that anybody was excluded from and there

267
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:41,120
was very little in the games that wasn't actually the sort of collegial summation of what everybody

268
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,040
had contributed. It was a far more creative, far more collegial environment than it is now.

269
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:58,560
So we would usually spend one or two, sort of maybe hour-long sessions together, all three of us and

270
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,320
maybe with some visitors here, brainstorming about puzzles, puzzle structure mostly, which

271
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,320
is all wrapped up in story and story structure. All the puzzles are sort of about people,

272
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:22,720
their weird needs. And then we would go off and have responsibilities and him and I were mostly

273
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:31,120
doing, we were sort of responsible for making a scene come to life. So it would be like, all right,

274
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,640
you're going to do the scene with these circus guys. And so part of that was, you know, somebody

275
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:44,880
would draw the art and but we would have to do some like stage direction, which is like,

276
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
these guys are going to stand over here and then when you talk to them, they're going to walk over

277
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,280
here. If anybody does any animations during the conversation, just say how and when that's going

278
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:02,960
to happen. When developing the puzzles for Monkey Island, Ron, Dave and Tim made sure to bear Ron's

279
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:12,640
roles in mind. Typically, we would do it how you might think of it as backwards, which is think of

280
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:20,400
the goal first, and then think of how you achieve the goal. That would start with story. So the

281
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:28,640
usual approach is to sort of take the overall idea for the stories and break it down into a few

282
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:36,000
acts. Each act has some kind of a goal that the character is trying to achieve. And then break

283
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,640
down that goal into some sort of goals that sort of make sense. And then take each one of those

284
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,720
and break it down into some actions that you take to achieve them. Each action that you take should

285
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,960
be hopefully something that makes you feel a little bit clever and is sort of a leap of like,

286
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,280
oh, I gotta do this. It's fun in some other way. And there's definitely a

287
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,000
space between telling people exactly what to do and leaving them lost. You have to kind of

288
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,040
aim in the middle somewhere where you've got some information, but maybe not quite enough. And the

289
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,560
more you poke at it, the more you learn, then finally you get to a point where you're like,

290
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:27,040
ah, I know what I'm going to do. The stuff that I like best now are the things that aren't

291
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,560
puzzle puzzles, but that sort of use the standard interface to do other stuff. So

292
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:42,000
I mean, there's the insult sort of biting, but also around that you have to, the puzzle where

293
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,440
you have to follow the shopkeeper out into the forest to find the sword master. And I thought

294
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:56,560
that was a clever bit of subterfuge. And there's one puzzle where you have to, like the grog is

295
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,960
eating through your mugs and you have to keep transferring it from mug to mug as you get there.

296
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,520
And I like mugs, I think just because they're sort of breaking,

297
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,440
um, breaking the, what we have come to think of as this game or the adventure game puzzle,

298
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
which is just use this on that and see the reward.

299
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,280
For Monkey Island, the scum engine was improved over the last crusade with a seemingly small tweak.

300
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,040
Players can now hover over environmental objects to see their description and therefore interact

301
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:43,200
with them. This minor change made exploring the world much easier and far more intuitive.

302
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,960
The game was also littered with references and in-jokes, a trend already established in their

303
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,040
previous adventures like Zack McCracken. These references included nods to previous Lucasfilm

304
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,080
adventure games, Lucasfilm movie properties, and even George Lucas himself.

305
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,960
The things that are sort of specific, timely references to something that was in the news

306
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,240
like that year, mostly probably wouldn't even notice anymore. But the things that are sort of

307
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,320
more general references to a certain type of character last longer, like Stan the Ship Salesman

308
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,960
is a good example. He's loosely based on a real guy, right, Cal Worthington.

309
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,320
But he was the used car salesman who was on TV a lot in Southern California where I grew up.

310
00:29:50,560 --> 00:30:02,960
And people in Northern California or Oregon know about him. And Tim wrote that scene,

311
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,680
never having seen, I think, a Cal Worthington commercial. But he still kind of hits the

312
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,360
mark because there's something sort of universal about that kind of hand wavy,

313
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,600
noisy guy who's trying to sell you a car.

314
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,680
Dave Grossman even had a little dig at Sierra's adventures by programming in a spoof game

315
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:33,200
over screen. The way that happened was I got the background art for that scene.

316
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,720
I think Mike Ebert was the one who did that one. And there was just like a line over at the edge

317
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,680
of the piece of rock that he was standing on. And it just looked like a crack, like it was

318
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,440
supposed to break. And my first thought was, did I miss a meeting? And is there a puzzle about

319
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,800
this that I don't know about? So I just that night, I painted a different version of it where

320
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,000
the thing had broken off and made the piece so that I could animate it dropping down and

321
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,440
stepping it up there and put in this whole elaborate thing where the cliff crumbles,

322
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,520
but we just make the excuse that there's a rubber tree down there that you bounce off of

323
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,240
and you survive. But not before seeing the parody of the Sierra Death message come up.

324
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,480
Sorry, you died. No, haha. This isn't that kind of game. This is a Lucasfilm game.

325
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,960
The story and puzzles in Monkey Island were in the end very well put together,

326
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,880
and the game's sense of humour was light years ahead of anything that had come before.

327
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,440
The Secret of Monkey Island was such a joy to play because its constituent parts were all

328
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,120
exceptional, and the artwork was of course a huge part of this. Even the box art,

329
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,120
designed by Steve Bissell, was striking. For the first cover, we worked with an outside designer

330
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,320
for the logo, and I designed the illustration to fit with it. I must have started on it pretty

331
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,280
early because I have sketches of a version of Guybrush that's nothing like what he came to be.

332
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,280
In the roughs, he was kind of a muscly doofus. I had done the Zach McCracken cover previously,

333
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,600
and Ron said he wanted Monkey Island more realistic. That was a stretch for me,

334
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,040
but I did what I could with it.

335
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,600
In those days, a video game's box art was far more important than it is today.

336
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,160
Kids couldn't simply look up a game on the internet to assess its appeal,

337
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,400
so sales were made and broken on the attractive box art sat on the shelves.

338
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,280
Even the game's copy protection was visually striking, the Dyla Pirate Wheel.

339
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,520
The game would give the player a composite face made up of two different pirate faces.

340
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,680
It would then ask for a specific date to be entered relating to one of several Caribbean islands,

341
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,320
an ingenious device, and a bit of fun. During a particular rush period to get the game onto

342
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,440
shelves, the team were all hands on deck, so it's possible that Dave Grossman himself assembled

343
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:27,600
your Dyla Pirate Wheel. The game's artwork, all drawn in deluxe paint, a program familiar to any

344
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,520
Amiga owner in the late 80s and early 90s, was even more impressive. To understand why,

345
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,440
we need to rewind a few years.

346
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,280
And of course, none of those people were pixel artists. There was no such thing.

347
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:09,840
We were traditional illustrators who were proficient at making imagery using traditional

348
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:18,960
media, so we came to this new platform with a set of expectations about color and about detail

349
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:28,560
and about 2D visual skills in creating atmospheric perspective and linear perspective,

350
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:36,560
and all sorts of things that went into making a vivid 2D image that were rendered virtually

351
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:46,240
impossible by this low-res pixelated medium with 16 horrible EGA colors and nothing else available.

352
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,240
It made it almost impossible to do what we were trained as traditional illustrators to do.

353
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:00,000
So rather than being people who were in love with pixels and maximizing the visual and aesthetic

354
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,800
potential of pixels the way artists do today, we were people who saw pixels as a technological

355
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,360
misfortune that we had to somehow overcome as much as possible and compensate for.

356
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,120
So when I sat down to do Zach McCracken, the first thing I started doing was dithering the

357
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:28,400
16 awful EGA colors that we had to use. You know, there was this acid green and this acid magenta

358
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,680
and this sort of fire engine red and this buttercup yellow. I mean, there were no useful,

359
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,640
I mean, little spots of saturated color very important in a traditional illustration,

360
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,000
but those spots become focal issues because of vocal spots because they are supported by a

361
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,280
whole lot of the painting that's done in darker, less saturated background recessive colors,

362
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,440
and there were no recessive colors in the EGA palette except for black and well, except for gray,

363
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,080
really. I mean, even the brown was this bright orangey mustardy kind of

364
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,480
orangey, well not orangey, yellowy kind of brown. There just were no useful colors. So

365
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,560
I was being asked to draw, you know, architectural interiors and landscapes

366
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,040
without any of the colors I needed. So I just began to checkerboard dither

367
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,800
the ugly colors we were forced to use with into more useful colors.

368
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,480
The greatest hurdle faced by the Monkey Island art team was the EGA color palette,

369
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,000
which was a mere 16 colors and most of them unappealing.

370
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,920
We were challenged by the color palette. There was a good black, dark blue and yellow.

371
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,440
That helped the night scenes. Some other colors were not so forgiving.

372
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,120
You could shade a face with a mealy brown or a dark red. It never quite looked right.

373
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,160
Ron would have something in mind for all the locations and then gave us room to explore.

374
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,760
To combat this, Mark fought hard to use a technique called dithering in the background art.

375
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,600
Dithering is a technique by which a richer color palette or at least the illusion of one can be

376
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:10,640
created by blending the available 16 colors. For example, this image during the Zak McCracken

377
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,880
era of graphics would become this if dithering was used. The only problem was, dithering would not

378
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,680
compress. We finished Zak McCracken and all those backgrounds with solid fields of EGA color and

379
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,240
it has its own classic look now, but it's still not a look I would want to look at for very long.

380
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,760
At the end of that project, we were in crunch mode. We needed to be working over a couple of

381
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,160
weekends. They didn't want us hanging out on Skywalker Ranch through the weekends. They let

382
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,760
us take our PCs home to work. And while I had my PC at home and had finished what I needed to do

383
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:54,160
there, I just decided to draw a nice looking EGA picture, a scene of rows of receding hills covered

384
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,520
in crests of live oak trees against a twilight sunset with a crescent moon and some stars

385
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,000
and a sunset. Sort of an orange band of sunset at the bottom fading up into this blue twilight sky.

386
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,280
I did it all in dither. It was just so beautiful compared to what we were doing for Zak McCracken

387
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,720
and I saved it to my hard drive and then I went back to work on Monday. And when I finished up

388
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,720
what I needed to do Monday morning enough to go to lunch, I decided just to put that picture

389
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,440
up on my screen and go to lunch. Just let it sit there. I shared an office with the art director

390
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,760
then. His desk and my desk were in the same room next to each other. And I just put that image up

391
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,280
and went to lunch. I figured people could take a look at this. It was really, at some level,

392
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,320
it was an intentional complaint. We could be doing this if we could use dither.

393
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,040
So that picture was up there for quite a while and when I came back, Steve Arnold who was then

394
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,600
the head of the Lucasfilm Game Division was in an animated conversation with Ron Gilbert about why

395
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:10,400
dither didn't compress. And within a few weeks or a month at most, dither did compress. Ron and

396
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,560
his team had made changes to the SCUM engine that allowed for that. So the result was loom.

397
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,120
I did all the backgrounds for loom because I was the guy there that understood drawing and dither.

398
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,160
I was in no position to implement the ability to draw on dither. That was all Ron, but

399
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,120
I was the guy who knew what to do with dither on screen. So loom was our first attempt at a

400
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,120
dithered EGA game. And it won a lot of graphics awards because it places people thought this was

401
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,880
VGA art. And we're very surprised because VGA art wasn't really being used by gaming companies yet

402
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,520
at that point. It was all EGA. So that worked out really well. Secret of Monkey Island was the next

403
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,880
major game we did after that. And Secret of Monkey Island was, among other things, my doctoral thesis

404
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,480
on dithered EGA art. It was where I got to apply everything we learned about how to use

405
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,320
the EGA palette as dithered art during loom. So that was sort of the progression from

406
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,840
EGA art in Zach McCracken to the EGA art you have in Secret of Monkey Island.

407
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,480
The background art was split more or less in three between Mark, Steve and Mike Ebert.

408
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,240
This created a small problem. As each artist had their own distinctive style,

409
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,840
they sidestepped this issue by assigning each artist their own areas. So it was less noticeable

410
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,560
for the player. I was doing most of the background work for loom. I only did about a third of the

411
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,800
background work for Monkey Island. But I did most of the background work for loom.

412
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,560
Probably because I was the only person there who had ever given a second thought to dither

413
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,600
or wanted to try that yet. Because loom was the first time we really used dithered art in a

414
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,120
game, we did not understand going into loom what the impacts of that were going to be.

415
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,000
But one of the impacts of that that nobody saw coming till Monkey Island

416
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,720
was that once you were able to get more color choices into a game with dither,

417
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,600
personal artistic style suddenly began to actually be possible visibly on the screen.

418
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,240
When we did Zach McCracken with solid fields of EGA color, everybody's art looked the same.

419
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,280
It didn't matter whether you were me or Steve Purcell or Andy Warhol or Vermeer,

420
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,560
your artwork was going to look pretty much like everybody else's because there were so few

421
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,200
choices to make about what color to use or how to apply it to the image.

422
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:02,960
Just dithering those colors gave us enough additional choices about color and how to apply it.

423
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:11,200
And at that point, the images that Steve Purcell drew with dither and the images that I drew with

424
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,680
dither looked like two different artists drawing into slightly different styles.

425
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,760
So all of a sudden, you know, up until then it had been no problem to have three artists

426
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,920
working on a game. It was just going to look like one artist's work, no matter how many

427
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:35,280
artists you had helping. As of Monkey Island at least, you could really tell the difference

428
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,880
between Steve's dithered artwork and my dithered artwork. So for Monkey Island, the way we solved

429
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,600
that was we divvied up the different environments and handed them out to different artists. So

430
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,080
when it came to Melee Village, I was assigned that and I did all of the exteriors from Melee

431
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:01,360
Village and some of the interiors. When it came to the Monkey Village on Monkey Island, that was

432
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:08,560
all Steve Purcell. When it came to some of the other places, it was all Mike Ebert. By assigning

433
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,520
all of the images for a single environment to a single artist, that way when people moved from

434
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,200
one place to another and this looked completely different, it was because we were in some place

435
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,640
different now. It wasn't because of, hey, who drew this? We actually had to disguise those

436
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,400
differences in artistic style. They were a liability all of a sudden. But for Loom,

437
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,320
we had no idea that was going to happen. I was fine doing backgrounds, but Mark was able to take

438
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,520
them to another level. I tended to get assigned a weird or funny subjects or maybe they ended up

439
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,280
that way because of how I did them. I did the stone monkey head and Stan's dock with the grog machine.

440
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,160
I can't remember if the machine was part of the assignment or something I added to make it more

441
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,080
fun and anachronistic. I liked working on the big stone monkey head because it's silly and I like

442
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:03,520
strange stone Zardos type icons and stories. Dithering wasn't the only technique used in

443
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,960
deluxe paint to get the most out of the limited palette. Mark also utilized color cycling.

444
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,080
I didn't go in understanding the technology. I didn't go in interested in the technology. I just

445
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,080
went in trying to figure out how to make this damn thing do what I wanted it to do. And as such,

446
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,160
I never sat down knowing how to do what I was here to do today. I sat down to figure out how

447
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,280
to do. I was reinventing the wheel all the time because I'd never heard of wheels. And when we

448
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,640
started working on artwork for the game, one of the first things we did was that lookout point

449
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:48,560
with the stone arch where the old man is sitting by the bonfire staring out sea. And we were debating.

450
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,840
I mean, first of all, we were I was my first big challenge there was drawing firelight with

451
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:01,040
even in dither with these 16 horrible colors. You know, the way a fire looks like fire is not

452
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,280
just that it is orange and yellow, but that it is casting orange and yellow light on and shadows

453
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,960
onto things. We really didn't have the colors for it. But part of that debate ended up being about

454
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,680
whether or not to animate that fire at all. Again, all the art direction decisions that were made

455
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:28,000
by disk space, just the extra frames to animate that little bonfire were a serious calculation

456
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,200
terms of consumption of disk space. And we were very early in the game. And Ron didn't want to

457
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,360
just start, you know, eating up disk space with gratuitous environmental animations until we

458
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:46,640
were sure we could. So we were talking about just drawing that fire as a frozen part of the art,

459
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,920
which really didn't appeal to me again for artistic reasons. That was when Ron called my

460
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,120
attention, I believe to the color cycling feature in deep paint, deep paint came with this capacity

461
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:07,040
to identify a little row of colors of whatever length you wished in the palette. And of course,

462
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,000
in those days, the palette was 16 colors. So the length was pretty narrow, no matter how you

463
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,560
cut it. But to identify a little row of colors and tell this particular art file to switch the

464
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,440
positions of those colors in order in a loop at whatever speed you chose. So with 16 colors,

465
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,120
there wasn't a whole lot you could do with color cycling. I mean, you couldn't color cycle the whole

466
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,400
palette. Otherwise, the whole screen would just become a jumble of changing colors. So you got

467
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,040
to pick just two or three colors. But Ron said, here's a way to make things look like they're

468
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,920
moving on screen. Maybe you could just use this with the fire somehow to give it some motion without

469
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,040
us having to do frames. And that was, unbeknownst to me, the beginning of my color cycling career

470
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,640
right there. Because I, of course, once I discovered a new tool, even 10 years of using that tool,

471
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,240
I had to go back and figure out how I could use this better, how I could stretch this further.

472
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,120
You know, what we might be able to do to get around the apparent limitations of this and that

473
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,720
involved a lot of happy accidents along the way that opened my eyes to a possibility I would

474
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,080
never have just thought of on my own, etc. I had 10 years to play with this. So I got to do things

475
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,200
with it. Nobody thought we're possible. Nobody ever imagined would be possible when they first

476
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:33,520
saw the color cycling tool as presented by EA. The character animations were very accomplished,

477
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,120
too. Animating emotions and reactions was no mean feat where this kind of pixel art was concerned.

478
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,320
There was a lot of animation to be done, so there was plenty to split between me and Martin and Mike.

479
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,280
On Indiana Jones, I had done the first special case animation, where a character does something

480
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,560
that is specific to one moment in the game. In the case of Indy, it was him slipping down a bank.

481
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,840
Special case animations were something I guess I had a knack for, so I would get those assignments.

482
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,040
We had lots of characters that would appear in cycles of animation. The cycles were designed

483
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,440
by the animators to seem randomized. Martin and Ebert were really great at figuring out how

484
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,200
to sequence the motions to get the variety so it would feel more spontaneous. They were also

485
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,160
good at creating modular characters that could be used to make multiple variants of all the extras.

486
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,920
I was good at goofy stuff. I had fun working on the ghost ship in the Sword of Lava underworld.

487
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,640
The skeleton pirates were fun because the blue lent themselves to a kind of glow effect.

488
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,960
I enjoyed getting to figure out and animate Guybrush and Le Chuck. If my comic background

489
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,000
helped, maybe it was in making stuff up on the fly, which is also a help for storyboarding.

490
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,280
The challenge on the computer was in working in 16 colors and trying to give life to tiny characters

491
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,640
where you can barely see their faces. The challenge was getting these little figures to act with their bodies.

492
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,680
Of course, Monkey Island looked different depending on the platform.

493
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,680
The Amiga version was significantly better looking than the DOS EGA version,

494
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,000
and then it was entirely redone in VGA.

495
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,120
You know, we still only had 16 colors, right, all the way through the first version of Monkey Island.

496
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:22,000
It really wasn't until the VGA graphics became a lot more standard that we got access to 256 colors,

497
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,880
which I mean the Egg Mansion was in, you know, redone in. And I think when people play

498
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,520
me, Nick mentioned, or play Monkey Island today, most people are playing the VGA version.

499
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,520
So, you know, color space really changed. And then, you know, I don't know that memory was

500
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,400
really that big of a deal, just because the scum system was really good at being able to shuffle

501
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,360
stuff into and out of memories you needed it. I mean, it did, the more memory did allow us to do

502
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,040
more complex animations. And you really saw that starting with the last Crusade game,

503
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,320
you know, because the Maniac Mansion, there are no what we call special case animations, right?

504
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,360
People walked and that was it. When Indiana Jones came out, we started doing kind of special

505
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:12,320
animation. So, when Indiana Jones had to do something special, there was this special

506
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,000
animation that he would do that would only be seen in that one place in the game.

507
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,280
And having more memory and more disk space kind of allowed us to do more of those. And then,

508
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,240
by the time Monkey Island came out, you know, we had even more disk space and even more memory

509
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:32,560
to play with. And so, we could do even more, you know, of those special animations.

510
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,200
And the resolution was a lot higher. I mean, the Egg Mansion on the Commodore 64 was 160 pixels

511
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,760
across. And by the time Monkey Island came out, it was double that. So, it was 320 pixels across.

512
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:51,440
So, having more resolution, more colors, you know, more memory, we're all kind of nice.

513
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,880
But I don't think anything really fundamentally changed.

514
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,080
Part of the magic of The Secret of Monkey Island was its diverse roster of quirky characters,

515
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,920
not the least of which being the game's lovably goofy protagonist Guy Rush

516
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,280
Threepwood. He wasn't your typical video game hero.

517
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,960
I don't always thought about Monkey Island, you know, the protagonist, which later became Guy

518
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,120
Rush, as kind of being a seasoned pirate, right? And that's really, you know, if you look at the

519
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,720
Sierra games, you know, you're playing Police Quest and you're a seasoned cop in Police Quest.

520
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:33,040
And you're, you know, all these things, you're a seasoned person. And the player is not a seasoned

521
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:42,000
pirate. And so, it's really nice to be able to push this, you know, protagonist into the world

522
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,360
that doesn't know what's going on because the player doesn't know what's going on. It helps with

523
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:53,280
the game design because you can introduce the main character to things at the same time you

524
00:51:53,280 --> 00:52:01,040
introduce the player to things. The origin of the somewhat unusual name Guy Rush is an interesting one.

525
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,840
In those days, a movable sprite on screen was called a brush. In fact, I'm pretty sure that's

526
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,720
what the tool called it. There was a pull down menu in deep paint called brushes or something

527
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,920
like that, I think. And so, this, any, anything that you picked up and moved around on screen,

528
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,360
any bit of art that you picked up and moved around the screen was called a brush. So,

529
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:28,080
character sprites were referred to as brushes. And as we were in the early stages of designing the

530
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:36,320
game, our, I think the designer's first intent was that there would be a male protagonist and a

531
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:42,160
female protagonist and the player could decide whether to play the young pirate as a, you know,

532
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:50,400
as a man or a woman. In the end, I think that that alternative was eliminated because we realized

533
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,960
it was going to mean a dual set of every protagonist animation in the game. And that tiny bit of

534
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,160
floppy disk space we had in which to ship the game simply wouldn't accommodate that many animation

535
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,720
frames. So, but before we had figured out that there wasn't any way to fit that particular option

536
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,320
onto the disks, we were talking, having one of these group conversations about narrative aspects

537
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,840
of the game where Ron and Steve Purcell and Gary Winnick and I and Bucky Cameron and a

538
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,800
couple of programmers, I don't remember who at this point, we're all sitting in Gary's office

539
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,120
just shooting the bull, as we say, about all of these things that weren't in most of our job

540
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,640
descriptions or areas of expertise, but we were all people with interesting minds, creative people

541
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,640
with good senses of humor, and we were all having this thing. And what we were discussing at the

542
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,160
moment was what to name this protagonist, these two protagonist characters, you know, I think they

543
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:52,320
came up with a name for the woman first. And then I think Ron asked, so, okay, so what do we call the

544
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:59,120
Guybrush? And Steve Purcell said, well, how about Guybrush? And everybody looked at each other and

545
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,320
said, well, that's great, okay, and that's how Guybrush got his name. That decision wasn't made

546
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,440
by some designer sitting his desk alone someplace or talking with the other designers. That came

547
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,600
out of one of these pal around conversations that happened five times a day there. His surname

548
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,320
Threepwood came from a PG Woodhouse novel, The Brinkmanship of Galahad Threepwood.

549
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,600
The other characters are equally well designed, from Guybrush's independent love interest,

550
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,800
Elaine Marley, and arch nemesis, the ghost pirate Lechuk, to the supporting cast of

551
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,840
Down and Out Pirates and Melee Island inhabitants. Every single character not only has a unique

552
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:46,320
persona and sense of humour, but adds depth to the overall story. Stan, the used ship salesman,

553
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,760
Herman Toothrot, the Down and His Luck hermit marooned on Monkey Island, the list goes on.

554
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,080
The secret of Monkey Island had a strong female character in Elaine, but also with Carla, the

555
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,880
Swordmaster. The reveal that she was in fact a woman added gravitas to Guybrush's eventual

556
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,480
encounter with her. Carla was named and modelled after a Lucasfilm Games employee.

557
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,800
You know Elaine, Elaine was kind of switched to a woman. Originally the person who was supposed

558
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:25,600
to be the governor of the island was Governor Fatt, who appeared in Monkey Island 2 as a governor

559
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:35,600
and so I switched that character to be Elaine in Monkey Island.

560
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:43,280
The Swordmaster, I'm not really sure exactly how the Swordmaster came about. I do remember

561
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:51,840
having this weird questioning about everyone's assumption at the time on the team was really

562
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:57,280
that the Swordmaster was a man. So I remember thinking well what if what if she was a woman

563
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,160
right that would be interesting you know and then there was this woman who worked in the

564
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:11,040
product support department at Lucasfilm named Carla and I don't I don't know how it happened

565
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,560
but even if you look at the picture of the Swordmaster at Monkey Island that is Carla from

566
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:22,880
product support it looks exactly like her and so it was I'm and I'm not really sure how that

567
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:29,360
happened right so I'm not really sure how how that character became Carla from product support

568
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,800
but um but there was that that initial questioning of like well why does the Swordmaster have to

569
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:42,480
be a man let's let's make the Swordmaster a woman. Of course the build-up to the Swordmaster

570
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,360
encounter is one of the most well-loved aspects of the game the insult sword fights.

571
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,760
On Melee Island a pirate's most valuable weapon is not his sword but his sharp tongue.

572
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:01,280
Author Orson Scott Card most known for his 1985 novel Ender's Game recently made into a film

573
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,840
was brought in to contribute. Lucasfilm Games approached me during the time that I was reviewing

574
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:14,240
games for Compute Magazine and a couple others. In those days the big game consoles had not yet

575
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,440
taken over Commodore 64 and Atari were still treated as valuable game platforms. Apparently

576
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,360
someone at Lucasfilm Games liked the kind of things I said in my reviews of their games and

577
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,640
those of other teams and I was invited to visit and consult with them. I did a thousand ideas in

578
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,240
an hour session at Larkspur Landing and several other things I did in my writing classes at the

579
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:40,880
time but what I liked most was looking at various games under construction. The one year's completion

580
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,240
was loom with a fascinating, innovative interface. During the playthrough I made a couple of comments

581
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,120
about very slight improvements that might be helpful. As far as I know they use none of my

582
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:56,960
suggestions. Why would they? But somehow they still found a reason known only to them to recognize

583
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,480
me in the acknowledgments. The game that I contributed to most was Monkey Island. I was

584
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,560
delighted with the concept that instead of a twitch game where conflicts are resolved by pounding

585
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:11,600
on a control button or key at a very fast rate, Ron had come up with a dialogue centered way of

586
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,560
winning duels. When you start the game you have a selection of very lame insults. The computer AI

587
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,520
also has lame insults but they have a few better ones which can beat yours. Every insult you hear

588
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,000
is added to your selection of insults and eventually you earn your way into killer insults that defeat

589
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,280
all comers. And for that reason instead of keeping the fun for themselves they asked me to come up

590
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,040
with the insults. When I got home to Greensboro I asked my kids to help. What insults have they

591
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,080
heard among elementary school and middle school kids? The lame or the better I said. So they came

592
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:47,280
up with some terrific, embarrassingly bad insults to be the original selection. They also suggested

593
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,920
a few of the better ones but they had the most fun coming up with insults so stupid that same one

594
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,520
was more embarrassing than having one aimed at you. Then it was my job to come up with sword fighting

595
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,480
appropriate insults on a higher and higher order. It was one of the most fun yet challenging writing

596
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:08,480
tasks I've ever done. Of course the final decision on whether to use all or any of my suggested

597
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,920
insults rested entirely with the game's design team and I never checked to make sure whether

598
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:20,160
they used my insults. They did give me credit for all of them which was generous and maybe the insults

599
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,920
in the game all originated with me and my kids. That would be cool. My aging brain does not remember

600
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,200
any of the insults now. My son Jeffrey, now a game designer, played through Monkey Island several

601
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:36,480
times and because he only knew the opening insults he got a kick out of the advanced ones as he played.

602
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,120
I never played the game. When I was reviewing games Jeffrey would play them through until he

603
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,840
knew how they ended. Then he would demo them for me along with his comments on the gameplay,

604
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:51,520
story design, etc. I paid him half the pittons I was paid for my reviews. Odd how $50 seemed like

605
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,000
almost nothing to me but a fortune to my son at the time. The fact that he loved the game

606
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,680
made me feel confident that I had not let down the team at Lucasfilm Games.

607
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,520
In the end many of the insults were created by Dave and the Monkey Island team as the retorts

608
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:13,680
learned would need to have two uses. One as comebacks to the pirates insults in order to beat them

609
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:19,520
and two to talk back to the Swordmaster during Guy Brush's duel with her. This meant pairing

610
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:26,080
the comebacks with an entirely new set of insults. I mean we're working on the game and we just sort

611
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:33,920
of got this information that Orson Scott Card had written was writing some insults and comebacks for

612
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:40,160
us but the instructions we got were you know just take these and if you can use them use them and

613
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:45,600
if they don't work for you then don't worry about it and just make up to more stuff and and so

614
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,600
because he didn't really have all the context for what these were going to need to do

615
01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:00,720
which is a they needed to be sort of matched pairs of insult and comeback

616
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,880
that needed to be distinct from one another and that also were going to need to serve double duty

617
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,000
when you got to the Swordmaster you're going to have to use all your your comebacks again in

618
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:19,920
another context. That's a very narrow box that he was not given and so you know we just kind of

619
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:26,480
a list of interesting insults and and so what wound up happening was that Tim and I crafted

620
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:33,440
almost all of that but some of the insults are still in there and I think mostly with different

621
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,200
different comebacks so you know Scott's fingers are still in there somewhere.

622
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,280
All of Monkey Island's elements blended perfectly to submerge the player in this intriguing pirate

623
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:55,920
filled world and its distinct soundtrack played no small part in this. The soundtrack's composer

624
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,920
Michael Land had started at Lucasfilm Games in 1990. His background was not only as an

625
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:07,440
accomplished musician with experience in creating electronic music but also as a programmer.

626
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,800
Hired as their first in-house audio programmer and composer his first project would be the

627
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:19,760
Secret of Monkey Island. The soundtrack consisted almost entirely of Caribbean inspired music

628
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:26,160
with many characters and areas in the game having their own distinct theme. He struggled with the

629
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:32,240
music's fluidity matching the music to the action happening on screen. An issue he went on to fix

630
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,280
for the game's sequel with the development of the iMuze interactive music system but that's a

631
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:44,720
story for another time. The Secret of Monkey Island is undoubtedly a cult classic. A culmination of

632
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:50,960
extraordinary talent, gorgeous artwork, a great soundtrack, lovable characters, an unmatched

633
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:57,920
sense of humour and most importantly a well-crafted narrative. But what solidified it in the hearts

634
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:05,280
of gamers so profoundly that it's still so admired 30 years on. For some insight on this

635
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,840
let's hear from some of the game's fans.

636
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,120
The reason I love the Secret of Monkey Island is undoubtedly the humour. It has to be and I'm sure

637
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,120
lots and lots of people will say this. But for me it's the humour because I discovered this off

638
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,640
the back of playing Sierra's Police Quest which is as straight laced and as unfunny as a game can

639
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,280
be that's not to say it's not enjoyable so this was so refreshing when I discovered it. When I

640
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,320
fired it up in fact before it even loaded into the game you had things like the dial-up pirate

641
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:40,960
copy protection kit and of course as soon as you get into the game it becomes infinitely

642
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,960
quotable. You fight like a dairy farmer Pete. If for some reason you've never played this game

643
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,240
do it because the graphics hold up superbly, the script writing is a masterpiece, the jokes are

644
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,480
still as funny as they ever were and through the use of something like scumvm you can do away

645
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,160
with all compatibility problems and you can enjoy this as much as I did the day it came out.

646
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,600
The Secret of Monkey Island truly is in my opinion one of those games that everybody

647
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:13,360
should play at least once in their life. So Secret of Monkey Island wow the thing that

648
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:21,680
comes to mind with this game for me way back in 1990 released by Lucasfilms is the show number

649
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:28,400
of discs it came on. I mean eight discs I think on the game and on the whole and you know it was a

650
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:38,960
very innovative very important game and luckily on my Amiga at the time I'd sprung out for the

651
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,000
extra disc drive so you could have two discs going at once but still eight discs was always

652
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,160
a bit nervy for me or any number of discs because floppy discs were so corruptible

653
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,440
and with eight discs all you needed was for one of those discs to

654
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,400
stop working and the whole game was ruined so I remember sitting there and hearing the older

655
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:06,400
Amiga whirring away and crunched the disc as they would want to do and just hoping the thing was

656
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:15,280
going to load every time but the game itself the adventures of Guybrush what a great game

657
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,400
open things up in a big way for point and click adventures hope you enjoy the game

658
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,560
should you revisit it and if you're a retro gamer you really should.

659
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:33,520
My relationship with Monkey Island isn't the same as most other people of my age I'd always

660
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,960
heard that Monkey Island was good but I didn't actually play it until a couple of years ago

661
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:45,680
I'm a lifelong fan of adventure games specifically in fact LucasArts adventure games I've played

662
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:51,360
the dig I've played Day of the Tentacle I've played Grim Fandango obviously I'd heard of Monkey

663
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:56,880
Island and I was always conscious of its impact on the genre I knew the music I'd heard that

664
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,320
loads of times before it's a certified classic I just kept missing out on playing it it's one

665
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:08,080
of those classics that you just never get around to it's like being into films and yet somehow

666
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:13,440
never having seen the godfather anyway I finally got round to playing it on my old DOS laptop and

667
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,760
I was staggered by how good this game is there's no nostalgia for me here there's no rose tinted

668
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:27,280
memories of loading up old floppies on my Amiga this is just straight up great writing great puzzles

669
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:34,720
great jokes the humor in fact has survived surprisingly well it still feels really 90s

670
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:41,600
but it had me laughing out loud for real and when you consider that's me reading pixely text off

671
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:47,840
of a screen with no voice acting that is a testament to the quality of that writing there was always

672
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:53,040
this nagging doubt in my mind that Monkey Island wouldn't live up to the hype that nostalgia

673
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:59,440
was warping people's opinion of this game I'm glad to say that that is absolutely not the case

674
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,200
Monkey Island is a certified banger it gets so much right that I don't hesitate to recommend

675
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:15,040
this game to other people who missed out just like I did although a huge success from a technical

676
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:21,200
standpoint the secret of Monkey Island wasn't an immediate commercial success Sierra was still

677
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:27,600
outselling Lucasfilm's graphic adventures by a wide margin certainly in North America in fact

678
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,840
most of the team didn't realize it had become such a revered game until much later

679
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:40,000
we got ahead of marketing a Lucasfilm a guy named Doug Glenn and I think he had lived in Europe

680
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,920
and he lived in Italy for several years and so he he was always like we have to go to Europe we

681
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,600
have to go to Europe you know and I think Sierra online had kind of licensed the kinks west stuff

682
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:58,400
to I think Activision it's like the old Activision but to Activision and so I think I think Activision

683
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:03,120
kind of you know had the rights to all of Europe for this stuff and I think one of the things that

684
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:09,840
Doug Glenn did was he said no we're going to go to each individual country and do deals with

685
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:17,440
distributors in each country and I think his his philosophy at the time was if we do that these

686
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,800
individual distributors in Germany and Spain and the UK and stuff will have a lot more vested

687
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:29,040
interest in this game because it is a game for their market right and I think he was really

688
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,440
right about that and I think I think that's one of the things that kind of made Monkey Island

689
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:41,520
really explode in Europe is is that you know those those deals were not Europe as this big

690
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:47,360
you know giant entity but it was deals with Spain and deals with France and deals with Germany and

691
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:53,360
I think it gave those people a lot more ownership over the title and I think helped you know help

692
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:59,840
them promote it I mean today you release a game and 24 hours later right everyone's playing it and

693
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,800
there's reviews everywhere and all that stuff that wasn't the case back then you know we would release

694
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:10,480
a game and it would spend months you know in manufacturing getting hundreds of thousands

695
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,600
of floppy disks pressed and then it had to be shipped to stores and then you know so it was months

696
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:21,280
between when we would finish a game and it would actually come out on the shelves and

697
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,640
and I know I was very disappointed in the kind of sales of Monkey Island but you know I had

698
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:34,000
started working on Monkey Island 2 just immediately right Monkey Island 1 finished I went on vacation

699
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,120
for two weeks and I came back and I started working on Monkey Island 2 and I do kind of wonder right

700
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:44,480
if if we had had immediate feedback on the success of the game maybe I wouldn't have been allowed to

701
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,760
do Monkey Island 2 but I could almost start Monkey Island 2 without knowing how well Monkey

702
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:56,480
Island 1 did and so maybe that was a kind of blessing in disguise you know it's like Monkey

703
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,600
Island 1 came out I mean it did okay it wasn't a it wasn't a flop by any means and then Monkey

704
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:08,240
Island 2 came out and I left Lucasfilm right after Monkey Island 2 came out and so I didn't

705
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,240
um I don't know how well it did because I wasn't privy to any of that you know sales

706
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:19,520
information after I left there were two games I did and they were fun games and I was very

707
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:25,040
proud of the games but at that point I started Humongous Entertainment and that was really my

708
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,160
focus right which was making these adventure games for kids and I kind of in some ways forgot

709
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:38,800
about Monkey Island and it really wasn't until probably 2003 or 2004 when I started my blog

710
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:46,160
and I started doing blogging stuff and there were just just throngs of people would come to my blog

711
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:50,640
and that was actually a little bit of surprise for me and I'm like well I'm like yeah and I was like

712
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,720
you know 10 years ago why are you still playing it and and that's that's what I kind of personally

713
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:03,520
realized what an absolute cult following you know that those two games had was was when I when I

714
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,480
really when I started my blog and I started interacting with people and you know I made

715
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,800
a couple of you know trips to Europe just as vacations and stuff and I thought oh it'd be

716
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,840
fun to do little meetups with people and just the sheer number of people that came to those

717
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:24,000
meetups right just blew me away so I was I think that's the point that I kind of realized that

718
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,040
it had of the following that it had

719
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:36,720
you know success is is definable on very very kinds of like we got recognition like at the

720
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:42,720
game developers conference and stuff other other game developers like to do that and we all like

721
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:48,640
to you know I think we we knew that we have made something good just in terms of actual

722
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:56,480
monetary sales Lucasfilm never did that great in the US market we were certainly

723
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,560
overshadowed significantly by Sierra domestically uh but we did have a lot of European

724
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:11,360
fans go there you know that was like a significant portion of the income that we got in Europe

725
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:18,800
and you know there's no particular moment where I was like oh hey this is this is a success

726
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:26,240
and I guess I always felt like it was a success um just because it it came out which is I didn't

727
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:32,640
realize even how unusual that could be until much later in the career everything we did actually

728
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:39,200
released uh it came out and and people played it and we got fan letters and you know the people

729
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:48,480
seem to like it and I didn't um I didn't have a lot of uh insight or interest into what were the

730
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,200
financials of you know how much do we spend on this now we're making now somebody else's job

731
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:58,240
we had made something that was fun and various people were telling me that it was fun so in that

732
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:04,960
instance I knew right away that this is a success um and and the fact that people still talk about it

733
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:12,400
though is um that continues to amaze me on a daily basis like so many other things have come out

734
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,400
the fact that we made something that was not just good and fun but that actually continues to be good

735
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:24,400
and fun many years after its release is not something that I understood at the time

736
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:32,160
nor would I know how to plan for that people need to remember we had we did not sit down to make a

737
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:39,680
classic computer game nobody ever gave it a thought monkey island wasn't as good as it was

738
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:45,200
because we set out to make a classic computer game it was as good as it was because everybody

739
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:52,000
there was incredibly creative everybody there was very hard working and everybody there really

740
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,200
loved to make the best thing they could make the best way they could possibly make it no

741
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:02,240
matter what it was whether it was lunch we just thought we were making a computer game

742
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,160
and making the best game we could make because that was fun for us and when it was over I don't

743
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:12,400
think we gave the game another thought I did not discover that monkey island had become a classic

744
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:20,160
game until 2005 I went on doing I went on to develop these techniques with color cycling and

745
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:24,960
palette shifting and things that made me literally the only guy in the world who could do those things

746
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:36,160
with vga 256 color 8 bit art and I was beating away potential employers with a stick and you

747
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:43,600
know one of the eight guys for a very short time and then at the end of the 90s they they came out

748
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:49,120
with 3d CAD rendered art and within a year or two everything I was famous for doing was irrelevant

749
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,840
I mean I suddenly I went from being one of the most sought after

750
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:00,320
computer game artists in the country to having no work for years at all and went on to other things

751
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,720
I assumed that my career in computer gaming art was over and since my career had always been about

752
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:12,800
art not about computer gaming it honestly I mean financially it was a catastrophe for me

753
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,360
but in every other way it didn't bother me all that much I just went on to do other things

754
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:25,120
and assumed that was the end of things and then after a couple years in Omaha I came out to Seattle

755
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:31,840
Washington for on a two-week trip to attend the wedding of some friends there and attend a science

756
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,960
fiction fantasy convention happening in Seattle intending to go back to Omaha at the end of that

757
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,520
period of time and on my last night in town I called an old friend from the computer gaming

758
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,960
industry whom I'd worked for back in my heyday to say hey I'm in Seattle would you like to get

759
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:54,000
together for dinner and he said yes would you like to work for me and I said what he said yeah I'm

760
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,080
the head of a division of a pretty large subcontractor doing computer games would you like I really need

761
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:06,640
you because what I didn't know while I was out of the industry was that handheld gaming platforms

762
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:12,320
and smartphones were now powerful enough to run what we used to think of as desktop computer games

763
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:18,880
but not powerful enough to run 3d CAD rendered cinematographic console games and suddenly

764
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:24,480
they needed people who could do the old style 8-bit art and nobody knew how anymore because

765
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:32,080
everything had been replaced so I started doing this work again all of a sudden and on our first

766
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:37,840
day at this new company Steve was walking me around from cubicle to cubicle introducing me to all of

767
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,720
these by then I was in my late 40s introducing me to all of these 20-something year old artists

768
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:50,160
pixel artists hi hi this is a new guy working for our company today's his first day I just want

769
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:55,600
to introduce you his name is Mark Ferrari and several times these kids would look up and go

770
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,400
because they were kids to me I mean they were 25 years old but to me at that point these were

771
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:06,800
fresh-faced kids so they would look up go you're not the Mark Ferrari Mark Ferrari

772
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:14,720
I don't think so like Monkey Island how the hell do you know about Monkey Island I mean

773
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:19,600
this was way back at the beginning of my career I had forgotten about the secret of Monkey Island

774
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:25,120
I do you 25 year old kid know about Monkey Island I grew up playing that game that was one of my

775
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:30,080
favorite games I can't believe you're working for us this went on and on I mean it was just this

776
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:36,800
sort of growing wave of astonishment that the Mark Ferrari was working for their company now

777
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:42,720
that was when I found out that Secret of Monkey Island was a classic game a secret of Monkey Island

778
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:48,400
was a success story that nobody saw coming even the development team but it changed the face of

779
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:53,920
adventure games forever becoming a timeless classic with gameplay and humor still as appealing today

780
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:01,600
as it was in 1990 Secret of Monkey Island is not just a classic because of the way it looks it's

781
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:09,680
not just a classic because of the way it left from Zach McCracken to you know EGA Secret of Monkey

782
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:16,400
Island in addition to that those were games that were about storytelling beyond their gifts as

783
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:22,880
artist programmer designer and administrator which were all considerable they were gifted

784
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:28,560
storytellers and the reason these games are classic more than anything about the scum engine

785
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:33,440
or the look of the art or any of the rest of that the reason they're classics is because

786
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:40,240
their exercise and storytelling was so good so that when somebody sat down to play these games

787
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:46,720
they were involved in discovering strange places meeting interesting people engaging in relationships

788
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:56,800
solving puzzles mysteries discovering it was it was a giant cavalcade of mental and emotional

789
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:05,200
creative exercise when those games were replaced by first person shooters all that narrative went

790
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:10,560
away and for years and years all you did then it was all about autonomic response and dopamine

791
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:17,120
loops it was all about developing muscular and nervous thumb twitches as you ran down an endless

792
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:23,760
visually interesting but airless and repetitive hallway kicking punching stabbing blowing up

793
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:31,360
and knifing whatever you encountered along the way there was often some little story scenario

794
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,880
attached at the beginning at the end to frame this somehow but there was no none of the same kind

795
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:42,880
of exercise it wasn't because those games were too slick technologically that people got bored

796
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:48,080
with them it wasn't because they were produced after the innocent age and they were all the same

797
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:53,840
it was because they weren't doing the thing they weren't doing the thing with your brain and your

798
01:19:53,840 --> 01:20:00,240
creativity that adventure games had done before they weren't storytelling games people don't

799
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:08,960
understand that their entire existence is storytelling but it is and that once you

800
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:14,400
understand that a whole lot of other things fall into place in very different ways than they do

801
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:22,720
for people who think it's all about some objective or mechanical aspect or approach it's the secret

802
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:35,200
of monkey island perhaps that is the true secret of monkey island thanks for watching

803
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:59,200
you

804
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:15,380
