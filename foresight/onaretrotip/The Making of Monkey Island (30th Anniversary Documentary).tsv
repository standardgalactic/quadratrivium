0	8320	30 years ago today Lucasfilm released a graphic adventure that would change the landscape
8320	12680	of adventure games forever and usher in a golden age for the genre.
12680	15800	That game was the secret of Monkey Island.
15800	19440	Today we'll hear from some of the team that created the game and find out the story behind
19440	20440	its development.
20440	24160	I'm on a retro tip and this is the making of Monkey Island.
50440	62000	This video will make some assumptions, not the least of which being that you have played
62000	63400	the game.
63400	67840	This isn't an analysis of the game itself, but rather a look at how it came to be, how
67840	71960	it was created and by whom.
71960	76000	Before we get to the secret of Monkey Island, it's important to understand the birth and
76000	79520	development of adventure games prior to 1990.
79520	82880	So a brief history is in order.
82880	87760	The genre itself and indeed the very name adventure game dates back to Colossal Cave
87760	92000	Adventure, first released in 1976.
92000	97000	This went by several names including simply adventure.
97000	101760	In these early days adventure games were what became known as text adventures.
101760	106800	The player is presented with small paragraphs of text outlining the story and its developments
106880	112320	and the player responds by entering simple one or two word commands.
112320	116960	Text adventures became very popular in the late 70s and early 80s, but it wasn't until
116960	123920	1980 that they became graphic adventures when Sierra Online, then known as online systems,
123920	127440	released Mystery House for the Apple II.
127440	132800	This was the first ever graphic adventure and, albeit primitive line drawings, depicted
132800	136520	an adventure game visually for the first time.
136520	140080	This was the birth of the graphic adventure game.
140080	145800	Obviously, technological advancements throughout the 1980s allowed these images to become more
145800	151200	and more detailed, but these adventure games still had one monumental flaw.
151200	157080	They still used command line interfaces relying on the player to input commands in text.
157080	161640	The text passes could be rather frustrating because they only recognized a set number
161640	168120	of commands, many or all of which would be unknown to the player at the outset.
168120	173680	The next significant leap for the genre came in 1984, again from Sierra, with the release
173680	176680	of the first King's Quest.
176680	180520	This was essentially a hybrid of graphic and text adventure.
180520	184760	The images on screen were now animated and the player could move the protagonist around
184760	189160	the screen without typing commands, but the majority of the game was still controlled
189160	192200	using text-based commands.
192200	196920	King's Quest saw a slew of sequels in the coming years, and some other very successful
196920	204120	entries in the Quest series, including Police Quest and Space Quest.
204120	208800	In 1986, Lucasfilm Games threw their hat into the arena with the release of their first
208800	212160	adventure game, Labyrinth.
212160	216720	Based on the Jim Henson film of the same name, it sought to sidestep some of the frustration
216720	221240	that came with these rigid command line interfaces.
221240	225760	David Fox at Lucasfilm developed a system using two word wheels, from which the player
225760	230640	could select from lists of available commands and interactive objects, thus creating an
230640	233560	instruction for the character.
233560	238080	This was far from ideal, but it was a huge step in the right direction, as it eliminated
238080	243880	the guesswork synonymous with text-based adventure games.
243880	249520	The next adventure from Lucasfilm Games, Maniac Mansion, came the following year.
249520	253880	Created by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, Maniac Mansion completely flipped the adventure
253880	259920	game genre command interface on its head by introducing SCUM, or Script Creation Utility,
259920	263040	for Maniac Mansion.
263040	268600	This gave the player a selection of available commands, like walk to, pick up, open and
268600	270440	close.
270440	274360	These commands could be selected, and then used to interact with objects or characters
274360	276400	by clicking on them.
276400	280920	This was a revolutionary step forward for the way adventure games would be played.
280920	286080	This interface was obviously far more suited to a mouse, and even by 1987 they weren't
286080	287080	standard.
287080	291400	It wasn't until the PC port of Maniac Mansion that the real advantage of having a mouse
291400	294800	became apparent.
294800	299880	Lucasfilm Games followed the success of Maniac Mansion in 1988, with their second SCUM game
300000	303360	Zack McCracken and the Alien Mindbenders.
303360	308880	The interface was very similar, although slightly improved, but even at this early stage Lucasfilm
308880	312840	were already establishing their style.
312840	317360	Their next two graphic adventures were 1989's Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, The Graphic
317360	322480	Adventure and 1990's Loom.
322480	325520	We'll hear more about Loom shortly.
325520	330160	And to understand how the secret of Monkey Island was conceived, we first need to understand
330160	335160	a bit more about Lucasfilm Games, and of course, meet the team who would create it.
339160	344080	Lucasfilm Games was a subdivision of Lucasfilm founded in 1982.
344080	348280	It began making original games for Atari, and all of its games were brought to market
348280	350680	by external publishers.
350680	357000	It wasn't until 1987's Maniac Mansion that Lucasfilm Games first self-published.
357000	360280	The company was small, certainly by today's standards.
360280	365400	In fact, that had been George Lucas's only instruction to the studio early on.
365400	368920	Stay small and don't lose any money.
368920	373160	The team that would work on the secret of Monkey Island were Ron Gilbert, the Concepts
373160	376880	creator, he also did design and programming.
376880	381240	Ron had previously done programming for a few of Lucasfilm's games, but most notably
381240	386880	designed and wrote Maniac Mansion, conceptualized Zack McCracken, and did design for the indie
386880	391400	and The Last Crusade graphic adventure.
391400	396120	Ron brought in two fledgling programmers to assist with the programming design and overall
396120	399920	story, Dave Grossman and Tim Schaefer.
399920	405280	They had both recently started at Lucasfilm, being hired in 1989 as Scumlitz, who would
405280	409520	help implement the designer's ideas within the Scum engine.
409520	413560	They had assisted with bits and pieces for some prior games, but the secret of Monkey
413560	418200	Island would be their first proper project.
418200	423320	The art team was made up of Steve Purcell, a cartoonist, notably the creator of Sam and
423320	427920	Max, who began at Lucasfilm Games in 1988.
427920	432680	He did artwork and graphics for the Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade graphic adventure,
432720	437520	graphics for the action game, artwork for Pipedream, and did character design and animations
437520	439880	for Loom.
439880	446040	He'd also designed the cover art for two games, Zack McCracken and Pipedream.
446040	450640	Mark Ferrari, an illustrator who had done art and animation for Zack McCracken, artwork
450640	455800	for Pipedream, and did all the background art for Loom.
455800	462200	Mike Ebert, another illustrator slash comic book artist, he started at Lucasfilm in 1989
462200	467560	and did actor art for the NES port of Maniac Mansion, artwork for Pipedream, and artwork
467560	472440	and graphics for The Last Crusade graphic adventure.
472440	477600	And Martin Bucky Cameron, who had previously done background art for Zack McCracken, graphics
477600	483920	and artwork for the indie graphic adventure, and had worked on a few other Lucasfilm games.
483920	487760	Steve Purcell, Mark Ferrari and Mike Ebert would be responsible for Monkey Island's
487840	494720	background art, and Steve, Mike and Martin Cameron would do its animations.
494720	499280	The art department was overseen by Gary Winnick, who had co-created Maniac Mansion with Ron
499280	500280	Gilbert.
500280	506560	He didn't work on Monkey Island directly, but oversaw the development as a whole.
506560	511000	The other notable team member was Michael Land, who began his Lucasfilm games career
511000	515200	in 1990 as their first in-house composer.
515200	521040	Prior to this, Lucasfilm had mostly outsourced the soundtracks for their games.
521040	525640	Of course, several other Lucasfilm games employees no doubt contributed towards the development
525640	529320	of Monkey Island, as was the norm at the company.
529320	533000	People often did a bit of everything, and it was common for employees outside of a games
533000	536920	development team to lend a hand where needed.
536920	541480	Quite a mixture of personalities here, most of the art team were illustrators or artists
541480	545960	outside of the world of gaming, and two of the game's lead designers, Dave Grossman
545960	555080	and Tim Schaffer, had never taken on such a role before.
555080	559280	Ron Gilbert first came up with the pirate theme for The Secret of Monkey Island as one of
559280	564280	several ideas for adventure game projects after developing Maniac Mansion.
565280	574280	Well, I had finished working on Maniac Mansion, and I was kind of thinking about another project.
574280	581960	And I came up with a few ideas that really never went anywhere, just ideas, and I wrote
581960	587200	down one page, and it was very common back at Lucasfilm at the time that people would
587200	593160	write little one-page design documents and then pass them around the office, and people
593160	598160	would comment on them and give feedback, and you'd sit down and chat with people, and
598160	604000	I did this for, I don't know, maybe probably three or four ideas post-Maniac Mansion,
604000	610200	and nothing really gained a lot of traction, and nothing was really super exciting.
610200	620320	And I was really kind of thinking about games like King's Quest, and you had a fantasy environment,
620400	627880	which was very popular back then, and it is today. Fantasy is a huge kind of genre in
627880	633680	games, and King's Quest kind of had this fantasy genre, and I started thinking about, well,
633680	640560	I wonder if that is one of the things that kind of makes it so successful, but I'm not
640560	648240	a big fantasy fan, and I didn't really want to make a game about dragons and such, and
648240	654480	I started thinking about, started thinking about them more, and that's really where things
654480	663280	like Pirates came up, because Pirates actually share a lot in common with fantasy, and I
663280	668480	thought, well, maybe if I did a game about pirates, I could kind of do fantasy without
668480	673240	actually doing fantasy, which I didn't really like, and so that's really where the whole
673320	677280	idea of pirates kind of sprung up, was from bad idea.
679160	684480	At this early stage, the project was known as Mutiny on Monkey Island. Looking at this
684480	688760	early design document, it had only vague similarities with the final game.
692040	698000	There were probably two major influences that just happened to, just by coincidence, you'll
698000	703760	read the book on Stranger Tides, which Tim Powers wrote, and that book was like this
703760	709600	real kind of eye-opener for me, because in that book, there were two things that kind
709600	716320	of made everything that I was thinking about for Monkey Island really click, and one was
716320	722880	that the protagonist in the story was kind of a fish out of water a little bit, right?
722880	728400	He was not a seasoned pirate. He doesn't really understand this world that he's in.
729040	734080	That made a lot of sense to me, and a lot of stuff with Monkey Island really clicked at that
734080	738720	point, because that's when I started thinking about, you know, the player is really in that
738720	746240	situation too, right? The player is not a seasoned pirate, and so it's really nice to be able to
746720	752800	push this, you know, protagonist into the world that doesn't know what's going on,
752800	758160	because the player doesn't know what's going on, and so they can both learn at the same time,
758160	764320	you know, about what it is to be a pirate, and that was so much so that the, I mean, the very
764320	769520	beginning line of Monkey Island is, you know, my name is Gavrish Supad, and I want to be a pirate.
769520	774240	I mean, he just states right at the beginning of the game, I don't know anything about this,
774240	779680	so that was like a big inspiration for me, you know, from kind of a story standpoint,
779680	784800	and the other was really the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, you know, I'd always loved that
784800	792160	ride as a kid, and there's just this feeling to that ride, especially at the very beginning.
792160	797200	At the beginning of the ride, you know, it's very slow, and there's lots of blues, and it's
797200	804000	nighttime, and I think you're in the Louisiana Bayou, and I just, I just, I love that kind of
804000	811520	environment a lot. In 1989, while developing the concept, Ron wrote an article called,
811520	817520	Why Adventure Games Suck. This outlined the adventure game tropes that he wanted to avoid
817520	824640	while making this new game. These included, end objective needs to be clear, the player must
824640	832240	have a sense of what they're trying to accomplish, and why. Live and learn, no deaths. Backwards
832240	839200	puzzles, avoid giving the player the solution before presenting the problem. I forgot to pick it up,
839760	843760	ensure that essential items can't be made unobtainable if forgotten earlier.
845360	849040	Puzzles should advance the story, and puzzles need to make sense.
849360	855920	And give the player options. These rules would allow the team to veer away from many of the
855920	860880	gameplay aspects common to graphic adventures that had led gamers to become rather frustrated with
860880	867600	the genre. Well, with Miniac Mansion, you know, we, we dropped the parser, right? That was the
867600	874480	thing I hated the most about Sierra games was the typing, right? I really, I mean, the first thing
874480	878960	it really intrigued me about the Sierra games before, you know, I had done Miniac Mansion was
878960	885200	just that they were graphic adventures, right? I had played adventure games from like Infocom,
885200	889920	and, you know, even back in my university days, you know, the original adventure stuff, and I
889920	897120	played those, and I really enjoyed those. And I was very intrigued by, by Sierra, because these
897120	902320	things felt graphical, and they weren't, they weren't graphics like, Oh, well, here's a static
902320	907280	picture, right? They were, they were graphics in terms of, you know, the guy would actually
907280	913280	walk around and you move him around and things were animated. And I was really intrigued by that.
914080	918640	But I really did not like the parser, which was kind of where Miniac Mansion came from,
918640	924320	and the whole, you know, scum interface, you know, ditching the parser. So that was one thing I
924320	929120	didn't really like. The other thing that I didn't like, and I really hadn't kind of formulated
929120	935280	this idea until after Indiana Jones, but was the death part of it. You know, the Sierra games
935280	941600	really seemed to revel in death, right? It was, it was something that the game would actually
941600	948160	chastise you for. And I always felt like the designers of those games actually took pleasure,
948160	954800	you know, in setting up a situation where the, you know, where the player would, you know,
954800	959840	would actually die. And there were lots of places in Miniac Mansion where the player could die and
959840	965520	you can get into no win situations and kind of post Indiana Jones. I really thought, you know,
965520	970720	I don't think the player should be able to die. You know, you should not be able to get into bad
970720	975120	situations where you're constantly having to save the game because you're afraid you're going to
975120	982080	make a mistake with Monkey Island, you know, at least to some degree, probably mostly, you know,
982080	990400	I kind of fixed that issue with that game. I found for my personal taste that that was
991520	995840	always overdone, that the deaths were too arbitrary. You couldn't see them coming. You would have felt
995840	1003840	like, like in Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones game, the one was built before I got there, you could
1003840	1008400	die, but it always felt like you earned it. You know, you lost a fight or something, because
1008480	1014240	there were reasons why you were dying. Whereas in the Sierra game, you would just, you know,
1014240	1020240	sort of accidentally click too far on the heart and you would walk into traffic and be run over by
1020240	1026720	accident. So that was sort of the, I think, the big philosophical difference between us. And we
1026720	1031760	would go out of our way to ensure that we didn't break the fantasy that never killed you off.
1031760	1040960	Ron assembled a team to work on this new project.
1042960	1050880	We had hired some more kind of programmers, and, you know, people like Steve Purcell had done a
1050880	1056960	lot of the art for, for the Indiana Jones game. And so, you know, I was familiar with him by working
1056960	1062400	on that. And we had also hired some new programmers to work in the scum system. I think there were
1062400	1068560	four of them that we had hired. You know, it kind of had that pool of people to really choose from,
1068560	1072800	you know, in terms of programmers. And, you know, Steve was kind of a natural, because we didn't
1072800	1077680	really have another project going on. So, you know, that's when Steve came on. And then Mark
1077680	1083440	Ferrari, who did all the art for Loom. So that's kind of, you know, I think how the team kind of
1083520	1090000	emerged. So at some point, Ron Gilbert came in and took Tim Schaefer and I aside and said,
1090000	1094080	look, I'm a game about pirates. And I want you guys to work on it with me, what do you say?
1094800	1100720	And we said, sure. So what else are we going to say? Of course he said yes. And that's how I
1100720	1108080	wound up on Gone Monkey, which was my first real, real game. I did background art for Zach McCracken
1108880	1116560	in using the EGA palette, using solid fields of color for the EGA palette. The next game,
1116560	1124240	the next major game that I did was Loom, which was done in Dithered EGA. Loom won a lot of awards
1124240	1129040	because of the way it looked and the way it looked was directly and almost entirely because we were
1129040	1135200	now using Dithered EGA color instead of solid fields of EGA color. And I believe that the next
1135200	1141040	major game I worked on after that was Secret of Monkey Island. I was already there at the company
1141040	1145360	where I had been creating some creature designs for a game that was canceled shortly after I got
1145360	1150880	there. They discovered I could paint and hired me to do the Zach McCracken cover. From that,
1150880	1155120	I was going to start on Monkey Island, but we all got shifted on to Indiana Jones and the
1155120	1161040	Last Crusade first. I don't remember Ron ever seeking me out. I was part of the small bullpin
1161040	1167200	that got assigned to whatever was happening next. The environment at Lucasfilm Games seemed
1167200	1172640	idyllic. The freedom that the development teams were afforded was significant and the setting
1172640	1179040	was picturesque to say the least. In those days, Lucasfilm Games was based at Skywalker Ranch
1179040	1185520	in California, a beautiful working environment close to the rest of Lucasfilm. I would drive up
1185520	1190400	to the Skywalker Ranch from Oakland, roll into the gates, maybe start the fireplace in the stable
1190400	1194880	house at the back of the ranch where our offices were. Settle in and start drawing into Luck's
1194880	1200080	paint. I can't remember if we would have teen check-ins every day. Gary Winnick was the head
1200080	1205600	of the art department, so I'm sure we would update with him at some point. At lunch, we'd walk over
1205600	1210960	to the main house, a big white Victorian house where they served an amazing lunch in a gorgeous
1210960	1216400	dining room with an NC Wyeth painting hanging above the fireplace. After that, Gary would say,
1216400	1222080	work or walk? We would usually choose to do a circuit of the ranch down to the farm area and
1222080	1228480	back past Skywalker Sound, which looks like a winery and past Lake Ewok. Sometimes we get
1228480	1232640	more ambitious and hike up into the hills surrounding the ranch. In the afternoons,
1232640	1238080	we'd labor at our desks and joke around as we worked. I'm sure Ron would come down and do
1238080	1243920	check-ins and let us know what was needed or coming soon. Late in the day, we would start playing one
1243920	1248560	of Larry Holland's World War II games. You could hear the little airplane motor buzz through the
1248560	1254640	cheesy PC speakers. If we goofed around too much during the day, we might stay late or there might
1254640	1260720	be a screening in the Art Deco Stagg Theater at Skywalker Sound. Once, on an after-lunch hike,
1260720	1265840	the artist decided to venture up for a look at George Lucas' observatory. He had built it to
1265840	1271680	house a telescope that someone had given him as a gift. On the way, we found a giant wooden spool
1271680	1277360	that power companies use to transport long lengths of cabling. We rolled the spool all the way to
1277360	1282960	the top of the hill overlooking Skywalker Ranch and let it go. It went careening all the way down
1282960	1288880	the hill and kicked up enough momentum to plow through a fence. Dorks that we were, we ran away
1288880	1294960	and never spoke of it. The location wasn't the only liberating aspect of Luke's film games.
1294960	1300640	The company's ethos was also very relaxed, allowing the development teams to shine creatively,
1300640	1306880	free from deadlines and money hungry executives. And Ron Gilbert applied that same spirit when
1306880	1313680	leading the Monkey Island team. I didn't realize how much freedom we had until later when I had to
1313680	1320000	have other jobs. We weren't responsible for keeping the company afloat. We were a tiny division of a
1320000	1328320	great big media empire that had lots of movie money and special effects money and sound production
1328320	1336320	money coming in. And it wasn't until a few years in that anybody even suggested that we
1336320	1341760	should make a profit. But I don't remember anybody specifically saying, you need to do this.
1342640	1347680	It was more, you know, we were all at 20 something and we were going into what we were doing.
1349680	1353840	Ron had a sense of what he wanted, but he was flexible enough to allow creative people to
1353840	1359360	contribute. To lead a project, you have to find out how to point everyone toward the same goal
1359360	1364560	and then give them the room to invest themselves in it. People do better work when they feel their
1364560	1369760	contributions are valued. The result is stronger when the lead can let the creative team flourish.
1371760	1376480	Although each team member had their role, a lot of the work on Monkey Island was a collaborative
1376480	1382000	effort, as was common at Luke's film games. Brainstorming sessions were common and ideas
1382000	1390480	were often bounced around. Working on the game and I was designing stuff and just really reacting
1390480	1395920	kind of to what we had seen implemented and going, oh, well, that's really interesting. Let's do more
1395920	1404480	of that. First of all, it was a new industry. Nobody had decided at that point what this was
1404480	1409440	about or what this should be about or where it was going. So everybody was in experimental
1409440	1416640	mode. Even the investors were in experimental mode in those days. So the fact that all the answers
1416640	1420880	hadn't been nailed down and everything that hadn't been nailed down hadn't been excluded
1420880	1426240	left a great deal of wiggle room that is no longer well, that hasn't been there until recently.
1426800	1433760	So our teams were six to a dozen people. Everybody knew everybody. Everybody was in contact and
1433760	1440720	talking and involved all day long and everybody was involved in all the discussions there were.
1440720	1446320	Everybody talked about game design. I mean, yes, we were each there to specialize in some part of
1446320	1451760	the game making process. A couple of us were there to do art and that was our area of expertise.
1451760	1458080	A couple of us there were there to do programming or game design and that was their area of expertise.
1458080	1465280	But everybody got together numerous times a day to talk about the art and the game design and puzzles
1465280	1473280	and dialogue and, you know, I mean, there wasn't anything that anybody was excluded from and there
1473280	1481120	was very little in the games that wasn't actually the sort of collegial summation of what everybody
1481120	1487040	had contributed. It was a far more creative, far more collegial environment than it is now.
1488960	1498560	So we would usually spend one or two, sort of maybe hour-long sessions together, all three of us and
1499200	1506320	maybe with some visitors here, brainstorming about puzzles, puzzle structure mostly, which
1506320	1512320	is all wrapped up in story and story structure. All the puzzles are sort of about people,
1513200	1522720	their weird needs. And then we would go off and have responsibilities and him and I were mostly
1522720	1531120	doing, we were sort of responsible for making a scene come to life. So it would be like, all right,
1531120	1536640	you're going to do the scene with these circus guys. And so part of that was, you know, somebody
1536640	1544880	would draw the art and but we would have to do some like stage direction, which is like,
1544880	1548000	these guys are going to stand over here and then when you talk to them, they're going to walk over
1548000	1555280	here. If anybody does any animations during the conversation, just say how and when that's going
1555280	1562960	to happen. When developing the puzzles for Monkey Island, Ron, Dave and Tim made sure to bear Ron's
1562960	1572640	roles in mind. Typically, we would do it how you might think of it as backwards, which is think of
1572640	1580400	the goal first, and then think of how you achieve the goal. That would start with story. So the
1580400	1588640	usual approach is to sort of take the overall idea for the stories and break it down into a few
1588720	1596000	acts. Each act has some kind of a goal that the character is trying to achieve. And then break
1596000	1602640	down that goal into some sort of goals that sort of make sense. And then take each one of those
1602640	1608720	and break it down into some actions that you take to achieve them. Each action that you take should
1608720	1614960	be hopefully something that makes you feel a little bit clever and is sort of a leap of like,
1614960	1621280	oh, I gotta do this. It's fun in some other way. And there's definitely a
1623120	1628000	space between telling people exactly what to do and leaving them lost. You have to kind of
1628000	1633040	aim in the middle somewhere where you've got some information, but maybe not quite enough. And the
1633040	1636560	more you poke at it, the more you learn, then finally you get to a point where you're like,
1636560	1647040	ah, I know what I'm going to do. The stuff that I like best now are the things that aren't
1649280	1654560	puzzle puzzles, but that sort of use the standard interface to do other stuff. So
1655680	1662000	I mean, there's the insult sort of biting, but also around that you have to, the puzzle where
1662000	1667440	you have to follow the shopkeeper out into the forest to find the sword master. And I thought
1667440	1676560	that was a clever bit of subterfuge. And there's one puzzle where you have to, like the grog is
1676560	1680960	eating through your mugs and you have to keep transferring it from mug to mug as you get there.
1680960	1685520	And I like mugs, I think just because they're sort of breaking,
1686320	1693440	um, breaking the, what we have come to think of as this game or the adventure game puzzle,
1693440	1696480	which is just use this on that and see the reward.
1703600	1709280	For Monkey Island, the scum engine was improved over the last crusade with a seemingly small tweak.
1710400	1715040	Players can now hover over environmental objects to see their description and therefore interact
1715040	1723200	with them. This minor change made exploring the world much easier and far more intuitive.
1731680	1736960	The game was also littered with references and in-jokes, a trend already established in their
1736960	1743040	previous adventures like Zack McCracken. These references included nods to previous Lucasfilm
1743040	1748080	adventure games, Lucasfilm movie properties, and even George Lucas himself.
1754640	1760960	The things that are sort of specific, timely references to something that was in the news
1760960	1768240	like that year, mostly probably wouldn't even notice anymore. But the things that are sort of
1768240	1774320	more general references to a certain type of character last longer, like Stan the Ship Salesman
1774320	1780960	is a good example. He's loosely based on a real guy, right, Cal Worthington.
1784560	1790320	But he was the used car salesman who was on TV a lot in Southern California where I grew up.
1790560	1802960	And people in Northern California or Oregon know about him. And Tim wrote that scene,
1802960	1807680	never having seen, I think, a Cal Worthington commercial. But he still kind of hits the
1807680	1813360	mark because there's something sort of universal about that kind of hand wavy,
1813360	1815600	noisy guy who's trying to sell you a car.
1815840	1823680	Dave Grossman even had a little dig at Sierra's adventures by programming in a spoof game
1823680	1833200	over screen. The way that happened was I got the background art for that scene.
1834240	1840720	I think Mike Ebert was the one who did that one. And there was just like a line over at the edge
1840800	1847680	of the piece of rock that he was standing on. And it just looked like a crack, like it was
1847680	1851440	supposed to break. And my first thought was, did I miss a meeting? And is there a puzzle about
1851440	1856800	this that I don't know about? So I just that night, I painted a different version of it where
1856800	1862000	the thing had broken off and made the piece so that I could animate it dropping down and
1862000	1869440	stepping it up there and put in this whole elaborate thing where the cliff crumbles,
1869440	1873520	but we just make the excuse that there's a rubber tree down there that you bounce off of
1873520	1880240	and you survive. But not before seeing the parody of the Sierra Death message come up.
1881920	1886480	Sorry, you died. No, haha. This isn't that kind of game. This is a Lucasfilm game.
1888640	1892960	The story and puzzles in Monkey Island were in the end very well put together,
1892960	1896880	and the game's sense of humour was light years ahead of anything that had come before.
1897040	1901440	The Secret of Monkey Island was such a joy to play because its constituent parts were all
1901440	1907120	exceptional, and the artwork was of course a huge part of this. Even the box art,
1907120	1913120	designed by Steve Bissell, was striking. For the first cover, we worked with an outside designer
1913120	1918320	for the logo, and I designed the illustration to fit with it. I must have started on it pretty
1918320	1923280	early because I have sketches of a version of Guybrush that's nothing like what he came to be.
1924000	1929280	In the roughs, he was kind of a muscly doofus. I had done the Zach McCracken cover previously,
1929280	1933600	and Ron said he wanted Monkey Island more realistic. That was a stretch for me,
1933600	1935040	but I did what I could with it.
1937040	1941600	In those days, a video game's box art was far more important than it is today.
1942400	1946160	Kids couldn't simply look up a game on the internet to assess its appeal,
1946160	1950400	so sales were made and broken on the attractive box art sat on the shelves.
1950640	1957280	Even the game's copy protection was visually striking, the Dyla Pirate Wheel.
1959120	1963520	The game would give the player a composite face made up of two different pirate faces.
1964720	1969680	It would then ask for a specific date to be entered relating to one of several Caribbean islands,
1972080	1978320	an ingenious device, and a bit of fun. During a particular rush period to get the game onto
1978320	1983440	shelves, the team were all hands on deck, so it's possible that Dave Grossman himself assembled
1983440	2007600	your Dyla Pirate Wheel. The game's artwork, all drawn in deluxe paint, a program familiar to any
2007600	2013520	Amiga owner in the late 80s and early 90s, was even more impressive. To understand why,
2013520	2015440	we need to rewind a few years.
2038560	2043280	And of course, none of those people were pixel artists. There was no such thing.
2043280	2049840	We were traditional illustrators who were proficient at making imagery using traditional
2049840	2058960	media, so we came to this new platform with a set of expectations about color and about detail
2059040	2068560	and about 2D visual skills in creating atmospheric perspective and linear perspective,
2068560	2076560	and all sorts of things that went into making a vivid 2D image that were rendered virtually
2076560	2086240	impossible by this low-res pixelated medium with 16 horrible EGA colors and nothing else available.
2087040	2092240	It made it almost impossible to do what we were trained as traditional illustrators to do.
2093600	2100000	So rather than being people who were in love with pixels and maximizing the visual and aesthetic
2100000	2106800	potential of pixels the way artists do today, we were people who saw pixels as a technological
2106800	2113360	misfortune that we had to somehow overcome as much as possible and compensate for.
2113920	2121120	So when I sat down to do Zach McCracken, the first thing I started doing was dithering the
2121120	2128400	16 awful EGA colors that we had to use. You know, there was this acid green and this acid magenta
2128400	2135680	and this sort of fire engine red and this buttercup yellow. I mean, there were no useful,
2135680	2140640	I mean, little spots of saturated color very important in a traditional illustration,
2140640	2146000	but those spots become focal issues because of vocal spots because they are supported by a
2146000	2151280	whole lot of the painting that's done in darker, less saturated background recessive colors,
2151280	2157440	and there were no recessive colors in the EGA palette except for black and well, except for gray,
2157440	2162080	really. I mean, even the brown was this bright orangey mustardy kind of
2163440	2168480	orangey, well not orangey, yellowy kind of brown. There just were no useful colors. So
2169360	2174560	I was being asked to draw, you know, architectural interiors and landscapes
2174560	2179040	without any of the colors I needed. So I just began to checkerboard dither
2179040	2182800	the ugly colors we were forced to use with into more useful colors.
2184240	2188480	The greatest hurdle faced by the Monkey Island art team was the EGA color palette,
2188480	2192000	which was a mere 16 colors and most of them unappealing.
2192960	2197920	We were challenged by the color palette. There was a good black, dark blue and yellow.
2197920	2201440	That helped the night scenes. Some other colors were not so forgiving.
2202000	2207120	You could shade a face with a mealy brown or a dark red. It never quite looked right.
2207920	2212160	Ron would have something in mind for all the locations and then gave us room to explore.
2213040	2217760	To combat this, Mark fought hard to use a technique called dithering in the background art.
2218640	2223600	Dithering is a technique by which a richer color palette or at least the illusion of one can be
2223600	2230640	created by blending the available 16 colors. For example, this image during the Zak McCracken
2230640	2236880	era of graphics would become this if dithering was used. The only problem was, dithering would not
2236880	2243680	compress. We finished Zak McCracken and all those backgrounds with solid fields of EGA color and
2243680	2248240	it has its own classic look now, but it's still not a look I would want to look at for very long.
2249040	2253760	At the end of that project, we were in crunch mode. We needed to be working over a couple of
2253760	2258160	weekends. They didn't want us hanging out on Skywalker Ranch through the weekends. They let
2258160	2265760	us take our PCs home to work. And while I had my PC at home and had finished what I needed to do
2265760	2274160	there, I just decided to draw a nice looking EGA picture, a scene of rows of receding hills covered
2274160	2279520	in crests of live oak trees against a twilight sunset with a crescent moon and some stars
2279520	2286000	and a sunset. Sort of an orange band of sunset at the bottom fading up into this blue twilight sky.
2287120	2293280	I did it all in dither. It was just so beautiful compared to what we were doing for Zak McCracken
2293280	2300720	and I saved it to my hard drive and then I went back to work on Monday. And when I finished up
2300720	2306720	what I needed to do Monday morning enough to go to lunch, I decided just to put that picture
2306720	2311440	up on my screen and go to lunch. Just let it sit there. I shared an office with the art director
2311440	2317760	then. His desk and my desk were in the same room next to each other. And I just put that image up
2317760	2323280	and went to lunch. I figured people could take a look at this. It was really, at some level,
2323280	2328320	it was an intentional complaint. We could be doing this if we could use dither.
2328320	2335040	So that picture was up there for quite a while and when I came back, Steve Arnold who was then
2335040	2341600	the head of the Lucasfilm Game Division was in an animated conversation with Ron Gilbert about why
2342320	2350400	dither didn't compress. And within a few weeks or a month at most, dither did compress. Ron and
2350400	2358560	his team had made changes to the SCUM engine that allowed for that. So the result was loom.
2360640	2365120	I did all the backgrounds for loom because I was the guy there that understood drawing and dither.
2365120	2370160	I was in no position to implement the ability to draw on dither. That was all Ron, but
2371760	2377120	I was the guy who knew what to do with dither on screen. So loom was our first attempt at a
2377120	2383120	dithered EGA game. And it won a lot of graphics awards because it places people thought this was
2383120	2390880	VGA art. And we're very surprised because VGA art wasn't really being used by gaming companies yet
2390880	2397520	at that point. It was all EGA. So that worked out really well. Secret of Monkey Island was the next
2397520	2402880	major game we did after that. And Secret of Monkey Island was, among other things, my doctoral thesis
2402880	2408480	on dithered EGA art. It was where I got to apply everything we learned about how to use
2408480	2414320	the EGA palette as dithered art during loom. So that was sort of the progression from
2415680	2419840	EGA art in Zach McCracken to the EGA art you have in Secret of Monkey Island.
2422000	2426480	The background art was split more or less in three between Mark, Steve and Mike Ebert.
2427360	2432240	This created a small problem. As each artist had their own distinctive style,
2432240	2437840	they sidestepped this issue by assigning each artist their own areas. So it was less noticeable
2437840	2444560	for the player. I was doing most of the background work for loom. I only did about a third of the
2444560	2448800	background work for Monkey Island. But I did most of the background work for loom.
2450560	2454560	Probably because I was the only person there who had ever given a second thought to dither
2454560	2461600	or wanted to try that yet. Because loom was the first time we really used dithered art in a
2461600	2467120	game, we did not understand going into loom what the impacts of that were going to be.
2469280	2474000	But one of the impacts of that that nobody saw coming till Monkey Island
2475280	2482720	was that once you were able to get more color choices into a game with dither,
2483280	2489600	personal artistic style suddenly began to actually be possible visibly on the screen.
2490160	2496240	When we did Zach McCracken with solid fields of EGA color, everybody's art looked the same.
2496240	2503280	It didn't matter whether you were me or Steve Purcell or Andy Warhol or Vermeer,
2503840	2508560	your artwork was going to look pretty much like everybody else's because there were so few
2509280	2515200	choices to make about what color to use or how to apply it to the image.
2516080	2522960	Just dithering those colors gave us enough additional choices about color and how to apply it.
2522960	2531200	And at that point, the images that Steve Purcell drew with dither and the images that I drew with
2531200	2535680	dither looked like two different artists drawing into slightly different styles.
2536960	2541760	So all of a sudden, you know, up until then it had been no problem to have three artists
2542480	2547920	working on a game. It was just going to look like one artist's work, no matter how many
2547920	2555280	artists you had helping. As of Monkey Island at least, you could really tell the difference
2555280	2562880	between Steve's dithered artwork and my dithered artwork. So for Monkey Island, the way we solved
2562880	2569600	that was we divvied up the different environments and handed them out to different artists. So
2569600	2574080	when it came to Melee Village, I was assigned that and I did all of the exteriors from Melee
2574080	2581360	Village and some of the interiors. When it came to the Monkey Village on Monkey Island, that was
2581360	2588560	all Steve Purcell. When it came to some of the other places, it was all Mike Ebert. By assigning
2588560	2593520	all of the images for a single environment to a single artist, that way when people moved from
2593520	2597200	one place to another and this looked completely different, it was because we were in some place
2597200	2602640	different now. It wasn't because of, hey, who drew this? We actually had to disguise those
2602640	2608400	differences in artistic style. They were a liability all of a sudden. But for Loom,
2608400	2614320	we had no idea that was going to happen. I was fine doing backgrounds, but Mark was able to take
2614320	2619520	them to another level. I tended to get assigned a weird or funny subjects or maybe they ended up
2619520	2625280	that way because of how I did them. I did the stone monkey head and Stan's dock with the grog machine.
2626160	2630160	I can't remember if the machine was part of the assignment or something I added to make it more
2630160	2636080	fun and anachronistic. I liked working on the big stone monkey head because it's silly and I like
2636080	2643520	strange stone Zardos type icons and stories. Dithering wasn't the only technique used in
2643520	2648960	deluxe paint to get the most out of the limited palette. Mark also utilized color cycling.
2649280	2656080	I didn't go in understanding the technology. I didn't go in interested in the technology. I just
2656080	2662080	went in trying to figure out how to make this damn thing do what I wanted it to do. And as such,
2663280	2670160	I never sat down knowing how to do what I was here to do today. I sat down to figure out how
2670160	2675280	to do. I was reinventing the wheel all the time because I'd never heard of wheels. And when we
2675280	2680640	started working on artwork for the game, one of the first things we did was that lookout point
2680640	2688560	with the stone arch where the old man is sitting by the bonfire staring out sea. And we were debating.
2688560	2693840	I mean, first of all, we were I was my first big challenge there was drawing firelight with
2693840	2701040	even in dither with these 16 horrible colors. You know, the way a fire looks like fire is not
2701040	2707280	just that it is orange and yellow, but that it is casting orange and yellow light on and shadows
2707280	2712960	onto things. We really didn't have the colors for it. But part of that debate ended up being about
2712960	2719680	whether or not to animate that fire at all. Again, all the art direction decisions that were made
2719680	2728000	by disk space, just the extra frames to animate that little bonfire were a serious calculation
2728080	2733200	terms of consumption of disk space. And we were very early in the game. And Ron didn't want to
2733200	2739360	just start, you know, eating up disk space with gratuitous environmental animations until we
2739360	2746640	were sure we could. So we were talking about just drawing that fire as a frozen part of the art,
2747520	2753920	which really didn't appeal to me again for artistic reasons. That was when Ron called my
2753920	2761120	attention, I believe to the color cycling feature in deep paint, deep paint came with this capacity
2761120	2767040	to identify a little row of colors of whatever length you wished in the palette. And of course,
2767040	2772000	in those days, the palette was 16 colors. So the length was pretty narrow, no matter how you
2772000	2778560	cut it. But to identify a little row of colors and tell this particular art file to switch the
2778560	2785440	positions of those colors in order in a loop at whatever speed you chose. So with 16 colors,
2785440	2789120	there wasn't a whole lot you could do with color cycling. I mean, you couldn't color cycle the whole
2789120	2794400	palette. Otherwise, the whole screen would just become a jumble of changing colors. So you got
2794400	2799040	to pick just two or three colors. But Ron said, here's a way to make things look like they're
2799040	2805920	moving on screen. Maybe you could just use this with the fire somehow to give it some motion without
2805920	2813040	us having to do frames. And that was, unbeknownst to me, the beginning of my color cycling career
2813040	2818640	right there. Because I, of course, once I discovered a new tool, even 10 years of using that tool,
2818640	2824240	I had to go back and figure out how I could use this better, how I could stretch this further.
2824800	2829120	You know, what we might be able to do to get around the apparent limitations of this and that
2829760	2834720	involved a lot of happy accidents along the way that opened my eyes to a possibility I would
2834720	2840080	never have just thought of on my own, etc. I had 10 years to play with this. So I got to do things
2840080	2845200	with it. Nobody thought we're possible. Nobody ever imagined would be possible when they first
2845200	2853520	saw the color cycling tool as presented by EA. The character animations were very accomplished,
2853520	2859120	too. Animating emotions and reactions was no mean feat where this kind of pixel art was concerned.
2859680	2864320	There was a lot of animation to be done, so there was plenty to split between me and Martin and Mike.
2864320	2869280	On Indiana Jones, I had done the first special case animation, where a character does something
2869280	2874560	that is specific to one moment in the game. In the case of Indy, it was him slipping down a bank.
2875120	2879840	Special case animations were something I guess I had a knack for, so I would get those assignments.
2880400	2885040	We had lots of characters that would appear in cycles of animation. The cycles were designed
2885200	2891440	by the animators to seem randomized. Martin and Ebert were really great at figuring out how
2891440	2897200	to sequence the motions to get the variety so it would feel more spontaneous. They were also
2897200	2902160	good at creating modular characters that could be used to make multiple variants of all the extras.
2902720	2907920	I was good at goofy stuff. I had fun working on the ghost ship in the Sword of Lava underworld.
2907920	2912640	The skeleton pirates were fun because the blue lent themselves to a kind of glow effect.
2913440	2918960	I enjoyed getting to figure out and animate Guybrush and Le Chuck. If my comic background
2918960	2924000	helped, maybe it was in making stuff up on the fly, which is also a help for storyboarding.
2924000	2929280	The challenge on the computer was in working in 16 colors and trying to give life to tiny characters
2929280	2934640	where you can barely see their faces. The challenge was getting these little figures to act with their bodies.
2938080	2941680	Of course, Monkey Island looked different depending on the platform.
2941680	2945680	The Amiga version was significantly better looking than the DOS EGA version,
2945680	2948000	and then it was entirely redone in VGA.
2950160	2955120	You know, we still only had 16 colors, right, all the way through the first version of Monkey Island.
2955120	2962000	It really wasn't until the VGA graphics became a lot more standard that we got access to 256 colors,
2962720	2966880	which I mean the Egg Mansion was in, you know, redone in. And I think when people play
2966880	2973520	me, Nick mentioned, or play Monkey Island today, most people are playing the VGA version.
2973520	2979520	So, you know, color space really changed. And then, you know, I don't know that memory was
2979520	2984400	really that big of a deal, just because the scum system was really good at being able to shuffle
2984400	2989360	stuff into and out of memories you needed it. I mean, it did, the more memory did allow us to do
2989920	2997040	more complex animations. And you really saw that starting with the last Crusade game,
2997040	3002320	you know, because the Maniac Mansion, there are no what we call special case animations, right?
3002320	3007360	People walked and that was it. When Indiana Jones came out, we started doing kind of special
3007360	3012320	animation. So, when Indiana Jones had to do something special, there was this special
3012320	3016000	animation that he would do that would only be seen in that one place in the game.
3016560	3021280	And having more memory and more disk space kind of allowed us to do more of those. And then,
3021280	3026240	by the time Monkey Island came out, you know, we had even more disk space and even more memory
3026240	3032560	to play with. And so, we could do even more, you know, of those special animations.
3033200	3039200	And the resolution was a lot higher. I mean, the Egg Mansion on the Commodore 64 was 160 pixels
3039200	3045760	across. And by the time Monkey Island came out, it was double that. So, it was 320 pixels across.
3046320	3051440	So, having more resolution, more colors, you know, more memory, we're all kind of nice.
3051440	3054880	But I don't think anything really fundamentally changed.
3056880	3062080	Part of the magic of The Secret of Monkey Island was its diverse roster of quirky characters,
3062080	3065920	not the least of which being the game's lovably goofy protagonist Guy Rush
3065920	3069280	Threepwood. He wasn't your typical video game hero.
3070880	3074960	I don't always thought about Monkey Island, you know, the protagonist, which later became Guy
3074960	3081120	Rush, as kind of being a seasoned pirate, right? And that's really, you know, if you look at the
3081120	3086720	Sierra games, you know, you're playing Police Quest and you're a seasoned cop in Police Quest.
3086720	3093040	And you're, you know, all these things, you're a seasoned person. And the player is not a seasoned
3093120	3102000	pirate. And so, it's really nice to be able to push this, you know, protagonist into the world
3102000	3107360	that doesn't know what's going on because the player doesn't know what's going on. It helps with
3107360	3113280	the game design because you can introduce the main character to things at the same time you
3113280	3121040	introduce the player to things. The origin of the somewhat unusual name Guy Rush is an interesting one.
3121920	3127840	In those days, a movable sprite on screen was called a brush. In fact, I'm pretty sure that's
3127840	3132720	what the tool called it. There was a pull down menu in deep paint called brushes or something
3132720	3137920	like that, I think. And so, this, any, anything that you picked up and moved around on screen,
3137920	3141360	any bit of art that you picked up and moved around the screen was called a brush. So,
3142080	3148080	character sprites were referred to as brushes. And as we were in the early stages of designing the
3148080	3156320	game, our, I think the designer's first intent was that there would be a male protagonist and a
3156320	3162160	female protagonist and the player could decide whether to play the young pirate as a, you know,
3162160	3170400	as a man or a woman. In the end, I think that that alternative was eliminated because we realized
3170400	3176960	it was going to mean a dual set of every protagonist animation in the game. And that tiny bit of
3176960	3182160	floppy disk space we had in which to ship the game simply wouldn't accommodate that many animation
3182160	3186720	frames. So, but before we had figured out that there wasn't any way to fit that particular option
3186720	3192320	onto the disks, we were talking, having one of these group conversations about narrative aspects
3192320	3197840	of the game where Ron and Steve Purcell and Gary Winnick and I and Bucky Cameron and a
3197840	3202800	couple of programmers, I don't remember who at this point, we're all sitting in Gary's office
3203440	3211120	just shooting the bull, as we say, about all of these things that weren't in most of our job
3211120	3216640	descriptions or areas of expertise, but we were all people with interesting minds, creative people
3216640	3220640	with good senses of humor, and we were all having this thing. And what we were discussing at the
3220640	3226160	moment was what to name this protagonist, these two protagonist characters, you know, I think they
3226160	3232320	came up with a name for the woman first. And then I think Ron asked, so, okay, so what do we call the
3232320	3239120	Guybrush? And Steve Purcell said, well, how about Guybrush? And everybody looked at each other and
3239120	3244320	said, well, that's great, okay, and that's how Guybrush got his name. That decision wasn't made
3244320	3249440	by some designer sitting his desk alone someplace or talking with the other designers. That came
3249440	3255600	out of one of these pal around conversations that happened five times a day there. His surname
3255600	3260320	Threepwood came from a PG Woodhouse novel, The Brinkmanship of Galahad Threepwood.
3262640	3267600	The other characters are equally well designed, from Guybrush's independent love interest,
3267600	3272800	Elaine Marley, and arch nemesis, the ghost pirate Lechuk, to the supporting cast of
3272800	3279840	Down and Out Pirates and Melee Island inhabitants. Every single character not only has a unique
3279840	3286320	persona and sense of humour, but adds depth to the overall story. Stan, the used ship salesman,
3286880	3291760	Herman Toothrot, the Down and His Luck hermit marooned on Monkey Island, the list goes on.
3292880	3298080	The secret of Monkey Island had a strong female character in Elaine, but also with Carla, the
3298080	3304880	Swordmaster. The reveal that she was in fact a woman added gravitas to Guybrush's eventual
3304880	3310480	encounter with her. Carla was named and modelled after a Lucasfilm Games employee.
3312240	3318800	You know Elaine, Elaine was kind of switched to a woman. Originally the person who was supposed
3318800	3325600	to be the governor of the island was Governor Fatt, who appeared in Monkey Island 2 as a governor
3326480	3335600	and so I switched that character to be Elaine in Monkey Island.
3336640	3343280	The Swordmaster, I'm not really sure exactly how the Swordmaster came about. I do remember
3344240	3351840	having this weird questioning about everyone's assumption at the time on the team was really
3351840	3357280	that the Swordmaster was a man. So I remember thinking well what if what if she was a woman
3357280	3362160	right that would be interesting you know and then there was this woman who worked in the
3362160	3371040	product support department at Lucasfilm named Carla and I don't I don't know how it happened
3371040	3376560	but even if you look at the picture of the Swordmaster at Monkey Island that is Carla from
3376560	3382880	product support it looks exactly like her and so it was I'm and I'm not really sure how that
3382880	3389360	happened right so I'm not really sure how how that character became Carla from product support
3389360	3394800	but um but there was that that initial questioning of like well why does the Swordmaster have to
3394800	3402480	be a man let's let's make the Swordmaster a woman. Of course the build-up to the Swordmaster
3402560	3407360	encounter is one of the most well-loved aspects of the game the insult sword fights.
3408800	3413760	On Melee Island a pirate's most valuable weapon is not his sword but his sharp tongue.
3415280	3421280	Author Orson Scott Card most known for his 1985 novel Ender's Game recently made into a film
3421280	3427840	was brought in to contribute. Lucasfilm Games approached me during the time that I was reviewing
3427840	3434240	games for Compute Magazine and a couple others. In those days the big game consoles had not yet
3434240	3439440	taken over Commodore 64 and Atari were still treated as valuable game platforms. Apparently
3439440	3443360	someone at Lucasfilm Games liked the kind of things I said in my reviews of their games and
3443360	3448640	those of other teams and I was invited to visit and consult with them. I did a thousand ideas in
3448640	3454240	an hour session at Larkspur Landing and several other things I did in my writing classes at the
3454240	3460880	time but what I liked most was looking at various games under construction. The one year's completion
3460880	3466240	was loom with a fascinating, innovative interface. During the playthrough I made a couple of comments
3466240	3471120	about very slight improvements that might be helpful. As far as I know they use none of my
3471120	3476960	suggestions. Why would they? But somehow they still found a reason known only to them to recognize
3476960	3482480	me in the acknowledgments. The game that I contributed to most was Monkey Island. I was
3482560	3486560	delighted with the concept that instead of a twitch game where conflicts are resolved by pounding
3486560	3491600	on a control button or key at a very fast rate, Ron had come up with a dialogue centered way of
3491600	3496560	winning duels. When you start the game you have a selection of very lame insults. The computer AI
3496560	3501520	also has lame insults but they have a few better ones which can beat yours. Every insult you hear
3501520	3506000	is added to your selection of insults and eventually you earn your way into killer insults that defeat
3506000	3511280	all comers. And for that reason instead of keeping the fun for themselves they asked me to come up
3511280	3517040	with the insults. When I got home to Greensboro I asked my kids to help. What insults have they
3517040	3522080	heard among elementary school and middle school kids? The lame or the better I said. So they came
3522080	3527280	up with some terrific, embarrassingly bad insults to be the original selection. They also suggested
3527280	3531920	a few of the better ones but they had the most fun coming up with insults so stupid that same one
3531920	3537520	was more embarrassing than having one aimed at you. Then it was my job to come up with sword fighting
3537520	3542480	appropriate insults on a higher and higher order. It was one of the most fun yet challenging writing
3542480	3548480	tasks I've ever done. Of course the final decision on whether to use all or any of my suggested
3548480	3553920	insults rested entirely with the game's design team and I never checked to make sure whether
3553920	3560160	they used my insults. They did give me credit for all of them which was generous and maybe the insults
3560160	3565920	in the game all originated with me and my kids. That would be cool. My aging brain does not remember
3565920	3571200	any of the insults now. My son Jeffrey, now a game designer, played through Monkey Island several
3571200	3576480	times and because he only knew the opening insults he got a kick out of the advanced ones as he played.
3576480	3581120	I never played the game. When I was reviewing games Jeffrey would play them through until he
3581120	3585840	knew how they ended. Then he would demo them for me along with his comments on the gameplay,
3585840	3591520	story design, etc. I paid him half the pittons I was paid for my reviews. Odd how $50 seemed like
3591520	3596000	almost nothing to me but a fortune to my son at the time. The fact that he loved the game
3596000	3599680	made me feel confident that I had not let down the team at Lucasfilm Games.
3602480	3607520	In the end many of the insults were created by Dave and the Monkey Island team as the retorts
3607520	3613680	learned would need to have two uses. One as comebacks to the pirates insults in order to beat them
3613680	3619520	and two to talk back to the Swordmaster during Guy Brush's duel with her. This meant pairing
3619520	3626080	the comebacks with an entirely new set of insults. I mean we're working on the game and we just sort
3626080	3633920	of got this information that Orson Scott Card had written was writing some insults and comebacks for
3633920	3640160	us but the instructions we got were you know just take these and if you can use them use them and
3640160	3645600	if they don't work for you then don't worry about it and just make up to more stuff and and so
3646400	3651600	because he didn't really have all the context for what these were going to need to do
3652720	3660720	which is a they needed to be sort of matched pairs of insult and comeback
3661920	3666880	that needed to be distinct from one another and that also were going to need to serve double duty
3666880	3672000	when you got to the Swordmaster you're going to have to use all your your comebacks again in
3672400	3679920	another context. That's a very narrow box that he was not given and so you know we just kind of
3679920	3686480	a list of interesting insults and and so what wound up happening was that Tim and I crafted
3686480	3693440	almost all of that but some of the insults are still in there and I think mostly with different
3693440	3699200	different comebacks so you know Scott's fingers are still in there somewhere.
3702000	3709280	All of Monkey Island's elements blended perfectly to submerge the player in this intriguing pirate
3709280	3715920	filled world and its distinct soundtrack played no small part in this. The soundtrack's composer
3715920	3721920	Michael Land had started at Lucasfilm Games in 1990. His background was not only as an
3721920	3727440	accomplished musician with experience in creating electronic music but also as a programmer.
3728000	3732800	Hired as their first in-house audio programmer and composer his first project would be the
3732800	3739760	Secret of Monkey Island. The soundtrack consisted almost entirely of Caribbean inspired music
3739760	3746160	with many characters and areas in the game having their own distinct theme. He struggled with the
3746160	3752240	music's fluidity matching the music to the action happening on screen. An issue he went on to fix
3752400	3757280	for the game's sequel with the development of the iMuze interactive music system but that's a
3757280	3764720	story for another time. The Secret of Monkey Island is undoubtedly a cult classic. A culmination of
3764720	3770960	extraordinary talent, gorgeous artwork, a great soundtrack, lovable characters, an unmatched
3770960	3777920	sense of humour and most importantly a well-crafted narrative. But what solidified it in the hearts
3778160	3785280	of gamers so profoundly that it's still so admired 30 years on. For some insight on this
3785280	3787840	let's hear from some of the game's fans.
3792800	3797120	The reason I love the Secret of Monkey Island is undoubtedly the humour. It has to be and I'm sure
3797120	3801120	lots and lots of people will say this. But for me it's the humour because I discovered this off
3801120	3806640	the back of playing Sierra's Police Quest which is as straight laced and as unfunny as a game can
3806720	3811280	be that's not to say it's not enjoyable so this was so refreshing when I discovered it. When I
3811280	3816320	fired it up in fact before it even loaded into the game you had things like the dial-up pirate
3816320	3820960	copy protection kit and of course as soon as you get into the game it becomes infinitely
3820960	3826960	quotable. You fight like a dairy farmer Pete. If for some reason you've never played this game
3826960	3832240	do it because the graphics hold up superbly, the script writing is a masterpiece, the jokes are
3832240	3836480	still as funny as they ever were and through the use of something like scumvm you can do away
3836480	3842160	with all compatibility problems and you can enjoy this as much as I did the day it came out.
3842160	3845600	The Secret of Monkey Island truly is in my opinion one of those games that everybody
3845600	3853360	should play at least once in their life. So Secret of Monkey Island wow the thing that
3853360	3861680	comes to mind with this game for me way back in 1990 released by Lucasfilms is the show number
3861760	3868400	of discs it came on. I mean eight discs I think on the game and on the whole and you know it was a
3868400	3878960	very innovative very important game and luckily on my Amiga at the time I'd sprung out for the
3878960	3884000	extra disc drive so you could have two discs going at once but still eight discs was always
3884880	3890160	a bit nervy for me or any number of discs because floppy discs were so corruptible
3890160	3893440	and with eight discs all you needed was for one of those discs to
3894400	3900400	stop working and the whole game was ruined so I remember sitting there and hearing the older
3901280	3906400	Amiga whirring away and crunched the disc as they would want to do and just hoping the thing was
3906400	3915280	going to load every time but the game itself the adventures of Guybrush what a great game
3915280	3920400	open things up in a big way for point and click adventures hope you enjoy the game
3920400	3924560	should you revisit it and if you're a retro gamer you really should.
3926640	3933520	My relationship with Monkey Island isn't the same as most other people of my age I'd always
3933520	3938960	heard that Monkey Island was good but I didn't actually play it until a couple of years ago
3938960	3945680	I'm a lifelong fan of adventure games specifically in fact LucasArts adventure games I've played
3945680	3951360	the dig I've played Day of the Tentacle I've played Grim Fandango obviously I'd heard of Monkey
3951360	3956880	Island and I was always conscious of its impact on the genre I knew the music I'd heard that
3956880	3962320	loads of times before it's a certified classic I just kept missing out on playing it it's one
3962320	3968080	of those classics that you just never get around to it's like being into films and yet somehow
3968080	3973440	never having seen the godfather anyway I finally got round to playing it on my old DOS laptop and
3973440	3979760	I was staggered by how good this game is there's no nostalgia for me here there's no rose tinted
3979760	3987280	memories of loading up old floppies on my Amiga this is just straight up great writing great puzzles
3987280	3994720	great jokes the humor in fact has survived surprisingly well it still feels really 90s
3994720	4001600	but it had me laughing out loud for real and when you consider that's me reading pixely text off
4001600	4007840	of a screen with no voice acting that is a testament to the quality of that writing there was always
4007840	4013040	this nagging doubt in my mind that Monkey Island wouldn't live up to the hype that nostalgia
4013040	4019440	was warping people's opinion of this game I'm glad to say that that is absolutely not the case
4019440	4025200	Monkey Island is a certified banger it gets so much right that I don't hesitate to recommend
4025200	4035040	this game to other people who missed out just like I did although a huge success from a technical
4035040	4041200	standpoint the secret of Monkey Island wasn't an immediate commercial success Sierra was still
4041200	4047600	outselling Lucasfilm's graphic adventures by a wide margin certainly in North America in fact
4047600	4051840	most of the team didn't realize it had become such a revered game until much later
4053600	4060000	we got ahead of marketing a Lucasfilm a guy named Doug Glenn and I think he had lived in Europe
4060000	4065920	and he lived in Italy for several years and so he he was always like we have to go to Europe we
4065920	4071600	have to go to Europe you know and I think Sierra online had kind of licensed the kinks west stuff
4071600	4078400	to I think Activision it's like the old Activision but to Activision and so I think I think Activision
4078400	4083120	kind of you know had the rights to all of Europe for this stuff and I think one of the things that
4083120	4089840	Doug Glenn did was he said no we're going to go to each individual country and do deals with
4089840	4097440	distributors in each country and I think his his philosophy at the time was if we do that these
4097440	4102800	individual distributors in Germany and Spain and the UK and stuff will have a lot more vested
4102800	4109040	interest in this game because it is a game for their market right and I think he was really
4109040	4113440	right about that and I think I think that's one of the things that kind of made Monkey Island
4113440	4121520	really explode in Europe is is that you know those those deals were not Europe as this big
4121520	4127360	you know giant entity but it was deals with Spain and deals with France and deals with Germany and
4127440	4133360	I think it gave those people a lot more ownership over the title and I think helped you know help
4133360	4139840	them promote it I mean today you release a game and 24 hours later right everyone's playing it and
4139840	4144800	there's reviews everywhere and all that stuff that wasn't the case back then you know we would release
4144800	4150480	a game and it would spend months you know in manufacturing getting hundreds of thousands
4150480	4155600	of floppy disks pressed and then it had to be shipped to stores and then you know so it was months
4155680	4161280	between when we would finish a game and it would actually come out on the shelves and
4162000	4168640	and I know I was very disappointed in the kind of sales of Monkey Island but you know I had
4168640	4174000	started working on Monkey Island 2 just immediately right Monkey Island 1 finished I went on vacation
4174000	4179120	for two weeks and I came back and I started working on Monkey Island 2 and I do kind of wonder right
4179120	4184480	if if we had had immediate feedback on the success of the game maybe I wouldn't have been allowed to
4184480	4189760	do Monkey Island 2 but I could almost start Monkey Island 2 without knowing how well Monkey
4189760	4196480	Island 1 did and so maybe that was a kind of blessing in disguise you know it's like Monkey
4196480	4201600	Island 1 came out I mean it did okay it wasn't a it wasn't a flop by any means and then Monkey
4201600	4208240	Island 2 came out and I left Lucasfilm right after Monkey Island 2 came out and so I didn't
4208960	4214240	um I don't know how well it did because I wasn't privy to any of that you know sales
4214240	4219520	information after I left there were two games I did and they were fun games and I was very
4219520	4225040	proud of the games but at that point I started Humongous Entertainment and that was really my
4225040	4230160	focus right which was making these adventure games for kids and I kind of in some ways forgot
4230160	4238800	about Monkey Island and it really wasn't until probably 2003 or 2004 when I started my blog
4239760	4246160	and I started doing blogging stuff and there were just just throngs of people would come to my blog
4246160	4250640	and that was actually a little bit of surprise for me and I'm like well I'm like yeah and I was like
4250640	4256720	you know 10 years ago why are you still playing it and and that's that's what I kind of personally
4256720	4263520	realized what an absolute cult following you know that those two games had was was when I when I
4263520	4268480	really when I started my blog and I started interacting with people and you know I made
4268480	4272800	a couple of you know trips to Europe just as vacations and stuff and I thought oh it'd be
4272800	4277840	fun to do little meetups with people and just the sheer number of people that came to those
4277840	4284000	meetups right just blew me away so I was I think that's the point that I kind of realized that
4284560	4287040	it had of the following that it had
4289760	4296720	you know success is is definable on very very kinds of like we got recognition like at the
4296720	4302720	game developers conference and stuff other other game developers like to do that and we all like
4302720	4308640	to you know I think we we knew that we have made something good just in terms of actual
4308640	4316480	monetary sales Lucasfilm never did that great in the US market we were certainly
4317840	4324560	overshadowed significantly by Sierra domestically uh but we did have a lot of European
4324560	4331360	fans go there you know that was like a significant portion of the income that we got in Europe
4332320	4338800	and you know there's no particular moment where I was like oh hey this is this is a success
4338800	4346240	and I guess I always felt like it was a success um just because it it came out which is I didn't
4346240	4352640	realize even how unusual that could be until much later in the career everything we did actually
4352640	4359200	released uh it came out and and people played it and we got fan letters and you know the people
4359280	4368480	seem to like it and I didn't um I didn't have a lot of uh insight or interest into what were the
4368480	4373200	financials of you know how much do we spend on this now we're making now somebody else's job
4373200	4378240	we had made something that was fun and various people were telling me that it was fun so in that
4378240	4384960	instance I knew right away that this is a success um and and the fact that people still talk about it
4384960	4392400	though is um that continues to amaze me on a daily basis like so many other things have come out
4392960	4398400	the fact that we made something that was not just good and fun but that actually continues to be good
4398400	4404400	and fun many years after its release is not something that I understood at the time
4405360	4412160	nor would I know how to plan for that people need to remember we had we did not sit down to make a
4412160	4419680	classic computer game nobody ever gave it a thought monkey island wasn't as good as it was
4419680	4425200	because we set out to make a classic computer game it was as good as it was because everybody
4425200	4432000	there was incredibly creative everybody there was very hard working and everybody there really
4432000	4437200	loved to make the best thing they could make the best way they could possibly make it no
4437200	4442240	matter what it was whether it was lunch we just thought we were making a computer game
4442240	4446160	and making the best game we could make because that was fun for us and when it was over I don't
4446160	4452400	think we gave the game another thought I did not discover that monkey island had become a classic
4452400	4460160	game until 2005 I went on doing I went on to develop these techniques with color cycling and
4460160	4464960	palette shifting and things that made me literally the only guy in the world who could do those things
4464960	4476160	with vga 256 color 8 bit art and I was beating away potential employers with a stick and you
4476160	4483600	know one of the eight guys for a very short time and then at the end of the 90s they they came out
4483600	4489120	with 3d CAD rendered art and within a year or two everything I was famous for doing was irrelevant
4490080	4493840	I mean I suddenly I went from being one of the most sought after
4494560	4500320	computer game artists in the country to having no work for years at all and went on to other things
4501520	4506720	I assumed that my career in computer gaming art was over and since my career had always been about
4506720	4512800	art not about computer gaming it honestly I mean financially it was a catastrophe for me
4512800	4517360	but in every other way it didn't bother me all that much I just went on to do other things
4517360	4525120	and assumed that was the end of things and then after a couple years in Omaha I came out to Seattle
4525120	4531840	Washington for on a two-week trip to attend the wedding of some friends there and attend a science
4531840	4536960	fiction fantasy convention happening in Seattle intending to go back to Omaha at the end of that
4536960	4541520	period of time and on my last night in town I called an old friend from the computer gaming
4541520	4546960	industry whom I'd worked for back in my heyday to say hey I'm in Seattle would you like to get
4546960	4554000	together for dinner and he said yes would you like to work for me and I said what he said yeah I'm
4554000	4560080	the head of a division of a pretty large subcontractor doing computer games would you like I really need
4560080	4566640	you because what I didn't know while I was out of the industry was that handheld gaming platforms
4566640	4572320	and smartphones were now powerful enough to run what we used to think of as desktop computer games
4572320	4578880	but not powerful enough to run 3d CAD rendered cinematographic console games and suddenly
4578880	4584480	they needed people who could do the old style 8-bit art and nobody knew how anymore because
4584480	4592080	everything had been replaced so I started doing this work again all of a sudden and on our first
4592080	4597840	day at this new company Steve was walking me around from cubicle to cubicle introducing me to all of
4597840	4604720	these by then I was in my late 40s introducing me to all of these 20-something year old artists
4604720	4610160	pixel artists hi hi this is a new guy working for our company today's his first day I just want
4610160	4615600	to introduce you his name is Mark Ferrari and several times these kids would look up and go
4615600	4620400	because they were kids to me I mean they were 25 years old but to me at that point these were
4620400	4626800	fresh-faced kids so they would look up go you're not the Mark Ferrari Mark Ferrari
4627760	4634720	I don't think so like Monkey Island how the hell do you know about Monkey Island I mean
4634720	4639600	this was way back at the beginning of my career I had forgotten about the secret of Monkey Island
4639600	4645120	I do you 25 year old kid know about Monkey Island I grew up playing that game that was one of my
4645120	4650080	favorite games I can't believe you're working for us this went on and on I mean it was just this
4650560	4656800	sort of growing wave of astonishment that the Mark Ferrari was working for their company now
4656800	4662720	that was when I found out that Secret of Monkey Island was a classic game a secret of Monkey Island
4662720	4668400	was a success story that nobody saw coming even the development team but it changed the face of
4668400	4673920	adventure games forever becoming a timeless classic with gameplay and humor still as appealing today
4673920	4681600	as it was in 1990 Secret of Monkey Island is not just a classic because of the way it looks it's
4681600	4689680	not just a classic because of the way it left from Zach McCracken to you know EGA Secret of Monkey
4689680	4696400	Island in addition to that those were games that were about storytelling beyond their gifts as
4696400	4702880	artist programmer designer and administrator which were all considerable they were gifted
4702880	4708560	storytellers and the reason these games are classic more than anything about the scum engine
4708560	4713440	or the look of the art or any of the rest of that the reason they're classics is because
4713440	4720240	their exercise and storytelling was so good so that when somebody sat down to play these games
4720240	4726720	they were involved in discovering strange places meeting interesting people engaging in relationships
4727680	4736800	solving puzzles mysteries discovering it was it was a giant cavalcade of mental and emotional
4736800	4745200	creative exercise when those games were replaced by first person shooters all that narrative went
4745200	4750560	away and for years and years all you did then it was all about autonomic response and dopamine
4750560	4757120	loops it was all about developing muscular and nervous thumb twitches as you ran down an endless
4757120	4763760	visually interesting but airless and repetitive hallway kicking punching stabbing blowing up
4763760	4771360	and knifing whatever you encountered along the way there was often some little story scenario
4771360	4776880	attached at the beginning at the end to frame this somehow but there was no none of the same kind
4776960	4782880	of exercise it wasn't because those games were too slick technologically that people got bored
4782880	4788080	with them it wasn't because they were produced after the innocent age and they were all the same
4788080	4793840	it was because they weren't doing the thing they weren't doing the thing with your brain and your
4793840	4800240	creativity that adventure games had done before they weren't storytelling games people don't
4800240	4808960	understand that their entire existence is storytelling but it is and that once you
4808960	4814400	understand that a whole lot of other things fall into place in very different ways than they do
4814400	4822720	for people who think it's all about some objective or mechanical aspect or approach it's the secret
4822720	4835200	of monkey island perhaps that is the true secret of monkey island thanks for watching
4912720	4919200	you
4935200	4935380	you
