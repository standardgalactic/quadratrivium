Checking Wisecrack/Social Media and the Business of Anger.txt
1. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been shown to manipulate users' emotions, often eliciting anger which can then be used for political mobilization, especially by political elites.
2. Historically, in the 20th century, Americans were encouraged to limit and control their expressions of anger, viewing it as a threat to social order. However, with the rise of the internet, people found new spaces to express anger freely.
3. Online platforms like Reddit or Twitter have become outlets for catharsis where individuals can vent their frustrations without the same societal constraints they might face in person.
4. Social media companies profit from emotional engagement, and anger tends to generate more clicks, comments, and shares than other emotions, which incentivizes the spread of content that provokes strong reactions.
5. The prevalence of anger on social media contributes to a more divided and polarized society, as the algorithms favor content that elicits intense emotions, potentially leading to increased political polarization and strife.
6. There is an ongoing debate about whether users are trapped in a cycle of anger and division perpetuated by these platforms for profit, or if there's a way to transcend this dynamic and achieve more constructive discourse.
