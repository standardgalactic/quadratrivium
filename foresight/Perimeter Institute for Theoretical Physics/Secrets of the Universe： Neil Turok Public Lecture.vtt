взглянуть на небо и понимать, что наш место в космос

01:22.980 --> 01:26.140
является основным константином в этом мире.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.500
Мы игнорируем, что париметр находится на традиционной территории

02:33.540 --> 02:35.100
and our speaker for tonight,

02:35.100 --> 02:37.660
someone who may be familiar to many of you.

02:37.660 --> 02:40.020
Бурно в Сауэфрике, профессор Нил Тарак

02:40.020 --> 02:42.260
получил его пиадея из Эмпериала Лондона

02:42.260 --> 02:44.980
и currently holds the Higgs Chair of Theoretical Physics

02:44.980 --> 02:46.500
at the University of Edinburgh,

02:46.500 --> 02:50.500
as well as the Carlo Fadani Roger Penrose Distinguished Visiting Research Chair

02:50.500 --> 02:53.020
in Theoretical Physics here at Perimeter Institute.

02:54.180 --> 02:57.980
В 2003 он Founded the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences,

02:57.980 --> 02:59.420
also known as AIMS,

02:59.420 --> 03:02.300
a Pan-African Network for training the next generation

03:02.300 --> 03:04.500
of mathematical scientists.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.900
Профессор Тарак has had a distinguished career,

03:06.900 --> 03:08.660
including numerous awards.

03:08.660 --> 03:10.220
He asked me to keep it short,

03:10.220 --> 03:13.100
but I would be remiss not to name a few,

03:13.100 --> 03:16.140
including the John Torrance Tate Medal for International Leadership

03:16.140 --> 03:18.020
of the American Institute of Physics,

03:18.020 --> 03:19.340
a TED Prize,

03:19.340 --> 03:22.540
the James Clerk Maxwell Medal of the UK Institute of Physics,

03:22.540 --> 03:25.980
and he is also an officer of the Order of Canada.

03:25.980 --> 03:27.860
In addition, as you may know,

03:27.860 --> 03:30.460
профессор Тарак served as the director of Perimeter

03:30.460 --> 03:32.580
from 2008 to 2018,

03:32.580 --> 03:36.060
and he was the driving force behind many of the programs and projects

03:36.060 --> 03:38.620
that have made Perimeter what it is today.

03:38.620 --> 03:42.620
He led Perimeter's growth into one of the world's foremost independent centers

03:42.620 --> 03:45.860
for theoretical physics and launched, among other initiatives,

03:45.860 --> 03:48.060
the Perimeter Scholars International Program,

03:48.060 --> 03:50.420
which is a master's program here at Perimeter,

03:50.500 --> 03:53.060
the Distinguished Visiting Research Chairs Program,

03:53.060 --> 03:55.100
and the Center for the Universe.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.420
Профессор Тарак's research focuses on developing fundamental theories

03:58.420 --> 04:00.420
of origin and evolution of the cosmos,

04:00.420 --> 04:02.500
as well as observational tests.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.380
He has collaborated with scientific luminaries,

04:04.380 --> 04:06.380
such as the late Stephen Hawking.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.460
Tonight, he will discuss recent developments in this quest

04:09.460 --> 04:11.620
to understand our cosmic home

04:11.620 --> 04:13.900
and the laws of nature governing everything,

04:13.900 --> 04:16.380
from particles to the entire universe.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.060
He will also explain how new measurements

04:18.060 --> 04:20.820
may soon test these exciting ideas.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.660
Please join me in welcoming to the stage Neil Тарак.

04:23.660 --> 04:38.140
АПЛОДИСМЕНТЫ

04:38.140 --> 04:39.260
Спасибо, Эмили.

04:39.260 --> 04:42.980
It's a real pleasure to be back here at Perimeter.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.220
I had such a lot of fun as director.

04:45.220 --> 04:47.860
Really was a unique opportunity.

04:47.860 --> 04:51.980
And it's just great to see it thriving today.

04:52.980 --> 04:58.540
So what I'm going to talk about is a new approach

04:58.540 --> 05:02.380
to tackling the secrets of the universe.

05:03.500 --> 05:08.020
And it's a new approach, actually born in a certain sense of frustration

05:08.020 --> 05:10.700
with previous approaches.

05:10.700 --> 05:15.060
In my view, they've become rather complicated and contrived,

05:15.060 --> 05:18.500
including my own approaches.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.060
And yet, the data, whether it was coming from the very small

05:22.060 --> 05:24.660
or the very large, was the opposite.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.620
It was stunningly simple.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.060
You know, the world's most powerful ever microscope,

05:30.060 --> 05:34.380
the Large Hadron Collider turned on, discovered the Higgs boson,

05:34.380 --> 05:39.940
which was almost guaranteed, and nothing else since.

05:39.940 --> 05:43.140
And so somehow nature has worked out a simpler way

05:43.140 --> 05:47.500
of being consistent than theorists had anticipated.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.300
So, same story on the very large scales,

05:50.300 --> 05:55.220
having mapped the entire visible cosmos.

05:55.220 --> 05:58.460
What we discovered is that the description of the cosmos

05:58.460 --> 06:00.460
is stunningly simple.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.700
It does not get more and more complicated.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.940
As you go to larger scales, it's the opposite.

06:04.940 --> 06:08.060
It gets simpler and simpler, apparently.

06:08.060 --> 06:15.220
So, based on this, it's really inspired me to try to devise simpler,

06:15.220 --> 06:19.820
more economical, more predictive, more principled explanations

06:19.820 --> 06:21.500
for what we see.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.700
And that's not easy.

06:24.700 --> 06:30.100
What I'm going to explain is very new, very preliminary.

06:30.100 --> 06:34.260
We've taken certain steps along a new route.

06:34.260 --> 06:40.820
But, and I'm here partly to expose these ideas to lots of experts.

06:40.820 --> 06:44.460
The institute is full of these kind of people,

06:44.460 --> 06:48.260
at least the modern-day equivalents.

06:48.260 --> 06:53.300
And this is very much the atmosphere at Perimeter.

06:53.300 --> 06:57.780
This may be the director of Perimeter.

06:57.780 --> 07:01.460
But I wanted to call your attention in particular.

07:01.460 --> 07:04.620
This is the kind of role I'm playing.

07:04.620 --> 07:07.780
This person looks like he's cheating.

07:07.780 --> 07:11.140
I am, because I'm looking at the answer,

07:11.140 --> 07:15.060
namely the universe and what we actually see from the observations.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.420
And I'm looking over the shoulder.

07:16.420 --> 07:20.340
This is an eximander, and he's looking over the shoulder of Pythagoras.

07:20.340 --> 07:25.740
Pythagoras is figuring out the exact logical rules of mathematics.

07:25.740 --> 07:31.300
And an eximander has one eye on that, so he's kind of okay at the math.

07:31.300 --> 07:36.780
But he's really taken these main clues from experiments and from the world.

07:36.780 --> 07:43.740
This person probably invented the concept of doing experiments to check scientific theories.

07:43.740 --> 07:46.980
So that's who I want to be.

07:46.980 --> 07:53.660
And over here is Euclid, figuring out the axioms of geometry.

07:53.660 --> 07:59.140
We have plenty of mathematicians in Perimeter Institute as well.

07:59.140 --> 08:02.380
So I'm going to tell you about these very new ideas.

08:02.380 --> 08:05.700
I'm surrounded by all these clever people.

08:05.700 --> 08:11.740
And I must warn you in advance that it could be that these ideas fall apart tomorrow.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.100
Somebody here may point out some serious flaw,

08:15.100 --> 08:18.860
and the whole theory will fall flat on its face.

08:18.860 --> 08:22.500
And I do apologize in advance.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.820
But I don't actually think that will happen.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.660
I hope that won't happen.

08:27.660 --> 08:30.300
But if it does, so be it.

08:30.300 --> 08:36.980
Good scientific theories are testable either through logic, logical argument,

08:36.980 --> 08:40.220
or through measurements.

08:40.220 --> 08:47.100
And one has to just celebrate when they fail and move on.

08:47.100 --> 08:51.580
Okay, so we live in a spectacular universe.

08:51.580 --> 08:57.300
And for some reason we don't understand, it literally tells us its secrets.

08:58.100 --> 09:04.660
The ways in which the laws of physics have been discovered illustrate this again and again.

09:04.660 --> 09:07.660
And so obviously we live outside the sun.

09:07.660 --> 09:10.940
It's spectacularly beautiful.

09:10.940 --> 09:17.980
And one of the main laws of quantum mechanics, Planck's law of radiation,

09:17.980 --> 09:21.100
that radiation comes in packets of energy,

09:21.100 --> 09:24.980
is illustrated perfectly just by the color of the sun.

09:25.060 --> 09:29.020
And so all we had to do, really, to figure out that light is quantized,

09:29.020 --> 09:32.100
is just look at the sun.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.620
Now we live inside the Big Bang.

09:34.620 --> 09:37.860
And the Big Bang is very similar in a way to the sun,

09:37.860 --> 09:41.620
except that we're inside it rather than outside it.

09:41.620 --> 09:46.500
The sun's temperature is about 6000 degrees.

09:46.500 --> 09:51.860
The temperature of the spherical shell in the universe

09:51.860 --> 09:56.260
that emitted the radiation we now see from the Big Bang,

09:56.260 --> 09:59.740
that shell was about 3000 degrees when the radiation was emitted.

09:59.740 --> 10:02.300
Certainly a factor of two different from the sun.

10:02.300 --> 10:08.540
So our place is outside the sun, but inside the Big Bang.

10:08.540 --> 10:12.980
And both of them are shining with light,

10:12.980 --> 10:18.060
according to the most fundamental principles of physics.

10:18.140 --> 10:24.620
So here is the first breakthrough satellite in 1992,

10:24.620 --> 10:28.620
that measured the radiation from the Big Bang with very high precision.

10:28.620 --> 10:31.900
And you see the curve here.

10:31.900 --> 10:36.300
This Planck spectrum is the most famous curve in physics,

10:36.300 --> 10:39.820
because it's the origin of quantum mechanics.

10:39.820 --> 10:43.420
So Planck figured this out from electric light bulbs,

10:43.420 --> 10:48.700
fitting the data in order to predict the color of an electric light bulb.

10:48.700 --> 10:54.780
But the sky, it turns out, is shining with exactly this spectrum.

10:54.780 --> 10:59.180
It's based on ideas of heat and thermodynamics,

10:59.180 --> 11:03.020
worked out by Boltzmann, this exponential law,

11:03.020 --> 11:07.740
that the probability of getting an energy E

11:07.740 --> 11:13.140
is given by exponential minus E over K Boltzmann T.

11:13.140 --> 11:17.860
And that describes this tale of the distribution at high frequency.

11:17.860 --> 11:21.460
But more importantly, energy is given by Planck's constant,

11:21.460 --> 11:24.580
times the frequency of the photon.

11:24.580 --> 11:28.940
And so the whole universe is literally shining at us

11:28.940 --> 11:33.500
with the elementary spectrum of quantum mechanics,

11:33.500 --> 11:37.100
telling us that light is quantized.

11:37.100 --> 11:41.940
It's an amazing fact, and the error bars on this curve are minuscule.

11:42.020 --> 11:50.660
В.е. the cosmic black body radiation is the best black body we know of in nature.

11:50.660 --> 11:55.980
It's very hard to make an artificial one anywhere near as good.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.260
В.е. we could have learned this from the sun

11:58.260 --> 12:01.300
if we were able to observe the solar spectrum.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.540
We can't because of the atmosphere.

12:03.540 --> 12:07.540
So the atmosphere creates lines, absorption lines.

12:07.540 --> 12:13.620
В.е. this spectrum is the extraterrestrial solar spectrum.

12:13.620 --> 12:16.900
В.е. if you get above the atmosphere, this is what you see.

12:16.900 --> 12:21.180
В.е. it also fits the Planck black body spectrum very well.

12:21.180 --> 12:25.860
В.е. you could have learned this just by looking at the sun.

12:25.860 --> 12:29.180
В.е. we just had to get above the atmosphere to do that.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.300
В.е. here again are the theoretical curves.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.460
В.е. this is at 5000 degrees.

12:33.460 --> 12:37.500
В.е. it's emitting colours, which are yellow and red.

12:38.460 --> 12:44.220
В.е. if you lower the temperature of the sun, it would get redder and redder.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.540
В.е. this is classical theory, which is absolutely hopeless.

12:47.540 --> 12:52.540
В.е. the quantum theory gets the right answer.

12:52.540 --> 12:59.900
В.е. the universe literally tells us its laws.

12:59.900 --> 13:03.340
В.е. that's the fundamental pieces of this lecture.

13:03.420 --> 13:08.780
В.е. we have to look at the incredible array of data we now have,

13:08.780 --> 13:13.500
figure out which parts of that data are really telling us something fundamental,

13:13.500 --> 13:15.940
and learn from that.

13:17.780 --> 13:21.260
В.е. here is Planck's basic postulate.

13:21.260 --> 13:24.020
П.е. Planck didn't come to this postulate easily.

13:24.020 --> 13:31.380
В.е. he said this was an act of desperation to try to make sense of what was going on.

13:31.420 --> 13:35.940
В.е. if you know that light is a wave,

13:35.940 --> 13:39.780
waves come in many wavelengths,

13:39.780 --> 13:44.740
and you can fit small waves into a given volume

13:44.740 --> 13:52.900
in a huge variety of waves, just imagine putting a wave of a certain length

13:52.900 --> 13:56.660
into a box, the smaller the wave is,

13:56.660 --> 14:00.420
the more waves there are distributing those waves.

14:00.460 --> 14:03.660
В.е. essentially, the problem they had in thermodynamics

14:03.660 --> 14:07.060
is that if that's really the way light worked,

14:07.060 --> 14:10.300
if that's all there was, that light was waves that could be

14:10.300 --> 14:14.580
any amplitude and any size,

14:14.580 --> 14:17.780
you could just fit vast numbers into a box.

14:17.780 --> 14:21.380
В.е. the light in the sun is basically in a box,

14:21.380 --> 14:23.820
because it's scattering off the particles.

14:23.820 --> 14:27.220
В.е. it takes about 100,000 years for a

14:27.220 --> 14:31.820
light wave emitted in the core of the sun to get out of the sun.

14:31.820 --> 14:35.420
В.е. this light is rattling around for a very, very long time,

14:35.420 --> 14:38.500
and if it was true that it could literally

14:38.500 --> 14:42.620
grind itself up into arbitrarily short waves,

14:42.620 --> 14:47.100
the sun couldn't possibly exist as a stable object.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.220
В.е. you would just grind all the light waves up

14:50.220 --> 14:52.540
into the shortest possible waves,

14:52.540 --> 14:55.980
and the sun would disappear in a flash

14:55.980 --> 14:59.100
of extremely short wavelength radiation.

14:59.100 --> 15:02.540
В.е. you need quantum mechanics to stop that,

15:02.540 --> 15:07.340
the quantization of the waves in units of energy,

15:07.340 --> 15:13.700
in particular that the short wavelength waves

15:13.700 --> 15:15.740
have to have a certain amount of energy

15:15.740 --> 15:22.060
to even exist as a piece of light, a photon.

15:22.060 --> 15:28.340
В.е. that is what stops this runaway into very short wavelengths.

15:28.340 --> 15:29.860
В.е. he came to this postulate,

15:29.860 --> 15:33.140
it's what allows the world to exist stably

15:33.140 --> 15:36.660
and objects like the sun, so it's very, very fundamental.

15:36.660 --> 15:40.620
В.е. here it is, the energy of a light wave

15:40.620 --> 15:43.620
is given by a constant times its frequency,

15:43.620 --> 15:45.780
and the frequency is related to the speed of light

15:45.780 --> 15:47.660
and the wavelength in this way.

15:47.660 --> 15:52.900
В.е. short wavelength photons have a lot of energy.

15:52.900 --> 15:54.380
В.е. you sort of feel this,

15:54.380 --> 15:58.140
when you listen to radio waves passing through you

15:58.140 --> 16:00.980
and the room and everywhere, we don't feel a thing,

16:00.980 --> 16:02.980
but if you stand in a bright sunlight,

16:02.980 --> 16:06.140
obviously you're feeling that radiation.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.940
В.е. the radiation comes in high energy packets,

16:09.940 --> 16:13.420
and that's why x-rays or gamma rays are dangerous,

16:13.420 --> 16:16.420
because each packet of energy can, you know,

16:16.420 --> 16:22.140
do something destructive to the molecules in your cells.

16:22.140 --> 16:26.780
В.е. here we are inside the bang,

16:26.780 --> 16:31.340
and as we now look out in more detail

16:31.340 --> 16:34.460
to this shell of radiation,

16:34.460 --> 16:37.220
which is coming at us from the big bang,

16:37.220 --> 16:39.060
you see this random pattern,

16:39.060 --> 16:42.660
and this was first mapped initially by Kobe

16:42.660 --> 16:46.820
at very low resolution, but then by this Planck satellite,

16:46.820 --> 16:51.340
and so it looks like just a random pattern of waves.

16:51.340 --> 16:53.140
В.е. somehow what came out of the big bang

16:53.140 --> 16:56.940
was pretty much like this, just a random pattern of ripples.

16:56.940 --> 17:00.300
The ripples, in this case, are the density of the universe.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.580
It varies slightly from place to place,

17:02.580 --> 17:05.220
and so does the temperature,

17:05.220 --> 17:09.500
as we see this surface emitting radiation.

17:09.580 --> 17:13.260
В.е. but it's anything but random,

17:13.260 --> 17:17.380
because, so it is, and it isn't random.

17:17.380 --> 17:22.900
В.е. it's random in the sense that the precise location of the waves is random,

17:22.900 --> 17:25.700
but the spectrum of radiation of the waves,

17:25.700 --> 17:30.180
just like with the Planck spectrum, is very, very precise.

17:30.180 --> 17:33.500
В.е. so this power spectrum means,

17:33.500 --> 17:39.460
if I look on a certain angular scale given by this formula,

17:39.460 --> 17:42.700
then, as I vary the angular scale,

17:42.700 --> 17:48.860
the strength of the waves varies according to this very precise curve.

17:48.860 --> 17:53.380
В.е. these features on the curve are really nothing surprising.

17:53.380 --> 17:59.500
They're just the sound waves in this hot plasma that came out of the big bang.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.420
They have a characteristic scale,

18:01.420 --> 18:04.300
just to do with the speed of sound in the plasma,

18:04.300 --> 18:08.780
and that causes these peaks and troughs.

18:08.820 --> 18:15.900
В.е. this curve was predicted long before the observations by Jim Peebles, among others.

18:15.900 --> 18:21.660
Jim Peebles won the Nobel Prize for predicting this, among other things.

18:21.660 --> 18:25.740
В.е. I was very fortunate to be the first to calculate this curve,

18:25.740 --> 18:30.220
which is the curve of the power spectrum of polarization

18:30.220 --> 18:33.180
of light coming from the big bang.

18:33.260 --> 18:39.260
В.е. the experts in the field had published papers saying that this was zero,

18:39.260 --> 18:43.700
but we realized that didn't make any sense.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.500
В.е. me and my postdocs, and we calculated this.

18:46.500 --> 18:51.740
В.е. amazingly, this curve is a prediction with no free parameters.

18:51.740 --> 18:56.700
В.е. if you adjust the cosmology, cosmological parameters to fit this curve,

18:56.700 --> 18:59.900
then this curve is absolutely predicted.

18:59.900 --> 19:05.100
В.е. this was one of the first influences on me telling me something.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.500
В.е. whatever is going on in the universe, it's really simple.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.540
В.е. it's not arbitrary.

19:11.540 --> 19:15.620
В.е. the laws, the universal Bayes are truly universal.

19:15.620 --> 19:18.620
В.е. if we get them right,

19:18.620 --> 19:22.820
в.е. the laws that go in here are Einstein's theory of gravity,

19:22.820 --> 19:25.060
и в.е. the laws of plasma physics,

19:25.060 --> 19:30.100
в.е. which were worked out in the 1920s, a long time ago.

19:30.100 --> 19:36.220
В.е. here is our model of the universe called Lambda CDM.

19:36.220 --> 19:40.780
В.е. it has just five fundamental parameters.

19:40.780 --> 19:45.300
В.е. the matter and energy content of the universe are described by three numbers.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.420
В.е. one is the cosmological constant.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.460
В.е. it's a little bit of a surprise, but not too much,

19:50.540 --> 19:57.580
В.е. this was the first type of energy Einstein envisaged to be relevant in the universe.

19:57.580 --> 20:01.380
В.е. I'll explain that a little in a moment.

20:01.380 --> 20:02.940
В.е. the dark matter,

20:02.940 --> 20:06.340
в.е. I used to think it was extremely mysterious.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.780
В.е. it's one of the big puzzles in cosmology.

20:08.780 --> 20:16.380
В.е. recently I've come to believe that there is actually a highly economical explanation of the dark matter.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.780
В.е. finally the ordinary atomic

20:19.780 --> 20:22.340
В.е. nuclear matter, which we are made of,

20:22.340 --> 20:25.660
В.е. and the abundance of that matter in the universe.

20:25.660 --> 20:29.020
В.е. that's another parameter.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.180
В.е. on top of that, there are two additional parameters.

20:32.180 --> 20:37.420
В.е. one is the amplitude or strength of these density waves,

20:37.420 --> 20:39.180
В.е. which came out of the Big Bang.

20:39.180 --> 20:42.180
В.е. it's approximately one part and a hundred thousand.

20:42.180 --> 20:44.740
В.е. the variation in the temperature from place to place,

20:44.740 --> 20:46.460
В.е. coming out of the Big Bang.

20:46.460 --> 20:50.140
В.е. the radiation we see is at three degrees Kelvin,

20:50.140 --> 20:54.860
В.е. the fluctuations are about 30 microkelvin.

20:54.860 --> 20:58.020
В.е. it's about one part and ten to minus five, just one number.

20:58.020 --> 21:01.020
В.е. there's a slight red tilt,

21:01.020 --> 21:04.540
В.е. telling you that fluctuations are ever so slightly stronger

21:04.540 --> 21:06.060
В.е. on longer wavelengths,

21:06.060 --> 21:10.180
В.е. as you look to longer wavelengths in the universe.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.220
В.е. that's it.

21:11.220 --> 21:12.060
В.е. that's it.

21:12.060 --> 21:14.620
В.е. there is no other

21:14.620 --> 21:18.660
В.е. conclusively measured parameter,

21:18.660 --> 21:24.260
В.е. there's no evidence for anything beyond this.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.940
В.е. there's no strong evidence.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.860
В.е. there's slight anomalies here and there.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.620
В.е. these may strengthen and become compelling,

21:32.620 --> 21:34.500
В.е. but at the moment,

21:34.500 --> 21:37.820
В.е. this may well be the full story.

21:37.820 --> 21:41.620
В.е. in contrast, our theories

21:41.620 --> 21:43.700
В.е. could not be more complicated.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.500
В.е. people talk about a multiverse,

21:45.500 --> 21:47.340
В.е. they talk about extra dimensions

21:47.340 --> 21:50.780
В.е. and you know,

21:50.780 --> 21:53.980
В.е. ten to the five hundred possible universes,

21:53.980 --> 21:56.220
В.е. chaos on large scales,

21:56.220 --> 21:58.940
В.е. that's not what we're seeing,

21:58.940 --> 22:00.660
В.е. and so,

22:00.660 --> 22:02.860
В.е. I've come to believe that what we need

22:02.860 --> 22:05.540
В.е. is a truly minimal theory

22:05.540 --> 22:07.620
В.е. that's highly economical

22:07.620 --> 22:10.180
В.е. it should be judged on whether or not

22:10.180 --> 22:12.740
В.е. it explains these numbers,

22:12.740 --> 22:14.180
В.е. that's a tool order,

22:14.180 --> 22:16.780
В.е. I'm going to tell you about a theory,

22:16.780 --> 22:19.500
В.е. which at least explains the last two numbers

22:19.500 --> 22:21.260
В.е. from first principles.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.100
В.е. what is the red tilt?

22:24.100 --> 22:26.020
В.е. I said it means the longer waves

22:26.020 --> 22:28.020
В.е. are slightly stronger,

22:28.020 --> 22:29.780
В.е. to make that a bit more precise,

22:29.780 --> 22:32.580
В.е. it means that if you go to wavelengths

22:32.580 --> 22:34.780
В.е. which are seven times longer,

22:36.060 --> 22:40.180
В.е. you get 4% greater amplitude.

22:40.180 --> 22:41.300
В.е. so not much.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.740
В.е. В.е. because 7 is the square of E

22:45.740 --> 22:48.020
В.е. and this tilt is 0.04.

22:50.220 --> 22:53.700
В.е. this holds over a very wide range of scales

22:54.380 --> 22:57.060
В.е. and one of my assumptions towards the end of the talk

22:57.060 --> 23:01.860
В.е. that would hold over a truly vast range of scales

23:01.860 --> 23:03.660
В.е. all the way from the plank length

23:04.100 --> 23:05.700
В.е. up to the scales we observe

23:06.260 --> 23:09.380
В.е. if so, this is an example of critical phenomena

23:09.940 --> 23:13.140
В.е. critical phenomena are what happens

23:13.140 --> 23:15.620
В.е. when systems go through a phase transition

23:17.020 --> 23:19.620
В.е. an example is critical opalescence

23:20.060 --> 23:25.540
В.е. you see this in very strongly heated water

23:26.300 --> 23:29.060
В.е. at high pressure, if you heat water strongly enough

23:31.020 --> 23:33.020
В.е. what happens is it turns into gas

23:33.020 --> 23:36.340
В.е. the gas and water, that very hot water

23:36.740 --> 23:40.100
В.е. the steam are indistinguishable

23:41.460 --> 23:43.060
В.е. you go through this funny phase

23:43.060 --> 23:46.260
В.е. which has very long range fluctuations

23:46.860 --> 23:48.780
В.е. that's exactly what we see in the universe

23:48.780 --> 23:51.060
В.е. it's very long range fluctuations

23:51.380 --> 23:54.540
В.е. with a particular red tilt

23:54.740 --> 23:58.860
В.е. this is a classic example, if true, of a critical phenomenon

23:59.340 --> 24:01.100
В.е. here it is in the lab, you see this

24:01.540 --> 24:03.820
В.е. this is a mixture of liquid and gas

24:04.300 --> 24:06.740
В.е. at high pressure, you heat it up

24:07.140 --> 24:08.380
В.е. this is the opalescence

24:09.020 --> 24:11.100
В.е. has these long wavelength fluctuations

24:11.100 --> 24:13.740
В.е. which make it slightly opaque to light

24:14.460 --> 24:18.100
В.е. if you go further, it becomes a completely clear

24:18.660 --> 24:20.140
В.е. superheated liquid

24:20.900 --> 24:24.220
В.е. I've just one example

24:24.220 --> 24:25.700
В.е. this is really everywhere

24:25.700 --> 24:28.620
В.е. this type of phenomenon is really everywhere in physics

24:29.540 --> 24:31.420
В.е. it may be that what we're seeing

24:31.420 --> 24:32.860
В.е. is somehow critical behavior

24:33.140 --> 24:36.500
В.е. at the Big Bang, which is pretty exciting, if true

24:38.660 --> 24:41.660
В.е. this was a very expensive picture

24:41.980 --> 24:43.780
В.е. made by the worlds

24:44.900 --> 24:46.740
В.е. by the Dark Energy Telescope

24:46.820 --> 24:48.060
В.е. there is actually a telescope

24:48.060 --> 24:49.660
В.е. sorry, Dark Energy Survey

24:49.900 --> 24:52.220
В.е. it's such a telescope, it costs millions of dollars

24:53.100 --> 24:54.220
В.е. this is what it saw

24:55.860 --> 24:56.980
В.е. that's the Dark Energy

24:56.980 --> 25:00.020
В.е. Dark Energy is the simplest form of energy

25:00.100 --> 25:02.420
В.е. it's absolutely uniform in space

25:02.580 --> 25:05.620
В.е. and time, it's immutable, unchanging

25:06.820 --> 25:08.020
В.е. it's a constant

25:08.220 --> 25:11.260
В.е. that's why Einstein introduced it into his equation

25:11.260 --> 25:14.180
В.е. as the very simplest type of matter

25:14.660 --> 25:17.140
В.е. which might be relevant to cosmology

25:17.500 --> 25:21.380
В.е. he was lucky, it turns out that most of the energy in the universe

25:21.380 --> 25:22.860
В.е. seems to take this form

25:24.060 --> 25:27.060
В.е. the strange thing about it is it's gravitationally repulsive

25:27.780 --> 25:30.300
В.е. in contrast to ordinary matter

25:30.300 --> 25:31.780
В.е. which attracts under gravity

25:32.100 --> 25:34.620
В.е. this repels and causes the universe

25:34.620 --> 25:35.340
В.е. to blow up

25:35.860 --> 25:38.860
В.е. there's this rather beautiful cartoon

25:38.980 --> 25:40.940
В.е. of Professor De Sitter

25:42.060 --> 25:44.140
В.е. who solved Einstein's equations

25:44.140 --> 25:46.460
В.е. with a cosmological constant

25:47.380 --> 25:49.020
В.е. and lambda is a symbol

25:49.020 --> 25:50.740
В.е. we use for the cosmological constant

25:50.740 --> 25:52.580
В.е. he's in the shape of a lambda

25:53.140 --> 25:54.460
В.е. the question it says

25:54.460 --> 25:56.260
В.е. what makes the balloon blow up

25:56.860 --> 25:58.380
В.е. that is done by the lambda

25:58.380 --> 25:59.900
В.е. there can be no other answer

26:00.460 --> 26:03.740
В.е. people knew about this in the 1920s

26:04.300 --> 26:06.060
В.е. it's a very old idea

26:07.620 --> 26:11.420
В.е. I've introduced some of the

26:12.300 --> 26:13.740
В.е. some of the ingredients

26:14.100 --> 26:17.220
В.е. dark matter is not

26:17.620 --> 26:18.940
В.е. the cosmological constant

26:18.940 --> 26:19.940
В.е. it's some kind of matter

26:19.940 --> 26:21.620
В.е. which clumps gravitationally

26:23.580 --> 26:25.100
В.е. people are often a bit suspicious

26:25.100 --> 26:26.500
В.е. of that in cosmology

26:26.820 --> 26:28.900
В.е. why do you introduce some weird form

26:28.900 --> 26:30.660
В.е. of matter and then assumes

26:30.660 --> 26:32.660
В.е. it clumps under gravity

26:32.660 --> 26:33.300
В.е. and so on

26:33.900 --> 26:35.260
В.е. they're right to be suspicious

26:35.620 --> 26:37.420
В.е. but actually due to

26:37.420 --> 26:39.060
В.е. the recent observational developments

26:39.060 --> 26:40.380
В.е. we can now actually see

26:40.380 --> 26:41.380
В.е. this dark matter

26:41.740 --> 26:43.300
В.е. using gravitational lensing

26:43.820 --> 26:45.500
В.е. as the light is emitted

26:45.500 --> 26:47.260
В.е. from this surface

26:47.260 --> 26:48.820
В.е. the hot surface to us

26:49.300 --> 26:50.540
В.е. it travels through

26:50.540 --> 26:52.300
В.е. this distribution of matter

26:52.700 --> 26:54.140
В.е. on the way and that deflects

26:54.140 --> 26:56.100
В.е. through lensing

26:56.340 --> 26:57.820
В.е. literally by gravity

26:57.820 --> 26:59.500
В.е. bending of light by gravity

27:00.300 --> 27:02.420
В.е. you see this lensed pattern

27:03.500 --> 27:05.060
В.е. is what we actually measure

27:05.460 --> 27:06.940
В.е. through measuring that pattern

27:06.940 --> 27:08.940
В.е. we can infer what the dark matter

27:08.940 --> 27:09.540
В.е. was doing

27:10.100 --> 27:11.740
В.е. this has recently been done

27:11.740 --> 27:12.620
В.е. just this year

27:13.860 --> 27:15.380
В.е. another telescope looking

27:15.380 --> 27:15.860
В.е. at the

27:17.100 --> 27:18.540
В.е. radiation from the Big Bang

27:19.260 --> 27:21.380
В.е. inferring this

27:21.780 --> 27:23.060
В.е. distribution of dark matter

27:23.380 --> 27:24.780
В.е. here's the actual

27:25.100 --> 27:27.260
В.е. projected density of dark matter

27:27.580 --> 27:28.820
В.е. along the line of sight

27:28.820 --> 27:29.660
В.е. all the way back

27:31.100 --> 27:31.740
В.е. to the

27:32.580 --> 27:33.460
В.е. the Big Bang

27:34.620 --> 27:36.020
В.е. so now we can actually

27:36.020 --> 27:37.260
В.е. literally see that

27:37.660 --> 27:38.820
В.е. much as you see

27:40.180 --> 27:42.260
В.е. a drop of water

27:42.260 --> 27:43.140
В.е. on your fingertip

27:43.140 --> 27:44.180
В.е. if you look at a light

27:44.180 --> 27:44.820
В.е. behind it

27:44.820 --> 27:46.020
В.е. you see it by the bending

27:46.020 --> 27:47.140
В.е. the water is transparent

27:47.140 --> 27:49.060
В.е. you see its effect

27:49.060 --> 27:49.780
В.е. bending the light

27:49.780 --> 27:50.580
В.е. this is the same

27:51.580 --> 27:52.420
В.е. the same effect

27:53.140 --> 27:54.140
В.е. gravity is doing the

27:54.140 --> 27:54.620
В.е. the same effect

27:55.500 --> 27:56.820
В.е. we can see this

27:56.820 --> 27:57.340
В.е. dark matter

27:57.340 --> 27:58.020
В.е. we still don't know

27:58.020 --> 27:58.740
В.е. what it is

27:59.540 --> 28:00.500
В.е. I'm going to tell

28:00.500 --> 28:01.220
В.е. what it is

28:01.820 --> 28:03.380
В.е. in a minute or two

28:04.300 --> 28:05.060
В.е. of course there's a

28:05.060 --> 28:06.380
В.е. a gigantic puzzle

28:06.780 --> 28:08.220
В.е. the whole thing

28:08.820 --> 28:10.340
В.е. the Big Bang

28:10.340 --> 28:11.580
В.е. that we live inside

28:12.140 --> 28:12.620
В.е. seems to have

28:12.620 --> 28:13.660
В.е. originated

28:14.340 --> 28:15.340
В.е. at a point

28:16.300 --> 28:16.940
В.е. it seems that

28:16.940 --> 28:18.220
В.е. everything we see

28:18.660 --> 28:19.380
В.е. traces back

28:19.380 --> 28:20.460
В.е. to a single point

28:21.220 --> 28:22.860
В.е. 14 billion years ago

28:23.820 --> 28:24.980
В.е. that's a massive

28:24.980 --> 28:25.660
В.е. surprise

28:26.220 --> 28:27.260
В.е. what I'm going to

28:27.260 --> 28:27.660
В.е. I'm going to claim

28:27.660 --> 28:29.140
В.е. that by dealing

28:29.140 --> 28:31.140
В.е. with this strange

28:31.140 --> 28:31.180
В.е. that by dealing with this strange

28:31.180 --> 28:31.220
В.е. that by dealing with this strange

28:31.220 --> 28:32.660
В.е. that by making

28:32.660 --> 28:33.580
В.е. a very specific

28:33.580 --> 28:34.260
В.е. hypothesis

28:34.260 --> 28:34.780
В.е. about it

28:35.300 --> 28:36.340
В.е. many of the puzzles

28:36.340 --> 28:37.220
В.е. in cosmology

28:37.220 --> 28:38.220
В.е. get resolved

28:40.900 --> 28:42.260
В.е. before we do that

28:43.140 --> 28:43.740
В.е. I want to tell

28:43.740 --> 28:44.420
В.е. a little bit more

28:44.420 --> 28:44.460
В.e. a little bit more

28:44.460 --> 28:45.660
В.e. about microscopes

28:47.100 --> 28:47.860
В.e. microscopes

28:47.860 --> 28:49.060
В.e. how we see

28:49.140 --> 28:50.620
В.e. the subatomic world

28:51.340 --> 28:52.460
В.e. Large Hadron Collider

28:52.460 --> 28:55.500
В.e. the greatest microscope

28:55.500 --> 28:56.140
В.e. built

28:56.780 --> 28:59.580
В.e. these cosmological

28:59.580 --> 29:00.260
В.e. measurements

29:00.260 --> 29:00.980
В.e. are even better

29:00.980 --> 29:01.820
В.e. microscopes

29:01.820 --> 29:02.860
В.e. potentially take

29:02.860 --> 29:03.700
В.e. us all the way back

29:03.700 --> 29:04.500
В.e. to the Big Bang

29:04.500 --> 29:06.700
В.e. this special point

29:06.700 --> 29:07.260
В.e. let's just

29:07.260 --> 29:08.500
В.e. talk about microscopes

29:09.660 --> 29:11.020
В.e. is a page

29:11.020 --> 29:12.460
В.e. from Heisenberg's

29:12.460 --> 29:14.420
В.e. book on quantum mechanics

29:14.860 --> 29:16.060
В.e. I just want to give

29:16.060 --> 29:18.460
В.e. an impression

29:19.060 --> 29:21.540
В.e. of how he argued

29:22.020 --> 29:23.020
В.e. for uncertainty

29:23.500 --> 29:24.740
В.e. the uncertainty principle

29:25.820 --> 29:26.780
В.e. followed from

29:26.780 --> 29:28.140
В.e. Plank's observation

29:28.140 --> 29:29.180
В.e. that light had to

29:29.180 --> 29:30.100
В.e. be quantized

29:30.100 --> 29:31.300
В.e. energy packets

29:32.060 --> 29:33.060
В.e. so I'm trying to

29:33.060 --> 29:34.100
В.e. I'm going to explain

29:34.420 --> 29:35.580
В.e. actually Heisenberg's

29:35.580 --> 29:36.180
В.e. explanation

29:36.180 --> 29:36.900
В.e. attributes

29:36.900 --> 29:37.580
В.e. to Bohr

29:38.460 --> 29:39.060
В.e. down there

29:39.620 --> 29:40.780
В.e. one thing about Heisenberg

29:40.780 --> 29:41.700
В.e. these diagrams

29:41.700 --> 29:42.660
В.e. really weren't very good

29:42.660 --> 29:44.220
В.e. this isn't even horizontal

29:45.900 --> 29:47.420
В.e. nor does it really tell

29:47.420 --> 29:49.500
В.e. what that X means

29:49.500 --> 29:51.340
В.e. anyway, it's an

29:52.220 --> 29:53.300
В.e. amazing argument

29:55.540 --> 29:56.540
В.e. the basic point

29:56.540 --> 29:57.900
В.e. about the uncertainty principle

29:57.900 --> 29:59.180
В.e. is that waves spread

29:59.500 --> 30:00.940
В.e. you can convince yourself

30:00.940 --> 30:02.020
В.e. of this just by taking

30:02.020 --> 30:02.620
В.e. a stick

30:03.140 --> 30:04.220
В.e. poking

30:04.820 --> 30:06.380
В.e. the surface of a lake

30:06.380 --> 30:07.380
В.e. like Silver Lake

30:07.380 --> 30:08.220
В.e. outside here

30:08.780 --> 30:10.540
В.e. when you poke

30:10.540 --> 30:11.660
В.e. the surface of the water

30:11.660 --> 30:13.580
В.e. you get waves which spread out

30:15.340 --> 30:17.380
В.e. imagine you try

30:17.980 --> 30:19.300
В.e. to emit a wave

30:19.300 --> 30:20.540
В.e. going in one direction

30:21.540 --> 30:24.700
В.e. that's impossible to do

30:24.900 --> 30:26.980
В.e. with a stick

30:28.300 --> 30:29.540
В.e. you just use the point

30:29.900 --> 30:31.460
В.e. so you poke the point

30:31.460 --> 30:32.860
В.e. all you'll get is

30:33.580 --> 30:34.620
В.e. spreading wave

30:34.620 --> 30:35.860
В.e. it won't go in a single

30:35.860 --> 30:37.180
В.e. direction, it'll spread out

30:37.700 --> 30:38.860
В.e. in all directions

30:39.500 --> 30:41.060
В.e. the only way to get it

30:41.060 --> 30:42.460
В.e. to go in one direction

30:42.820 --> 30:44.660
В.e. is to use the stick sideways

30:45.300 --> 30:46.460
В.e. so with a stick

30:46.460 --> 30:49.100
В.e. extended like this

30:49.100 --> 30:50.420
В.e. you poke it into the water

30:50.420 --> 30:52.060
В.e. the wave will go forward

30:52.060 --> 30:52.740
В.e. in that direction

30:52.740 --> 30:53.820
В.e. but of course it'll spread out

30:53.820 --> 30:54.340
В.e. at the ends

30:54.820 --> 30:56.260
В.e. that's called diffraction

30:56.460 --> 30:57.380
В.e. that was well known

30:57.380 --> 30:58.940
В.e. as a wave phenomenon

30:59.380 --> 31:00.660
В.e. I send a wave in

31:01.140 --> 31:05.540
В.e. to see some object

31:06.140 --> 31:06.940
В.e. this structure here

31:06.940 --> 31:08.340
В.e. is supposed to be the microscope

31:08.900 --> 31:10.100
В.e. I send a wave in

31:11.140 --> 31:12.460
В.e. an object of size

31:12.820 --> 31:13.660
В.e. delta x

31:14.980 --> 31:16.100
В.e. what's going to happen

31:16.100 --> 31:17.300
В.e. is the waves will spread

31:18.620 --> 31:20.060
В.e. they spread by this amount

31:20.300 --> 31:21.500
В.e. the angle of spreading

31:21.500 --> 31:22.460
В.e. is just the wavelength

31:22.460 --> 31:23.300
В.e. delta x

31:23.740 --> 31:24.820
В.e. so intuitively

31:24.820 --> 31:26.020
В.e. it's sort of obvious

31:26.020 --> 31:27.140
В.e. you can't see

31:27.700 --> 31:28.740
В.e. an object smaller

31:28.740 --> 31:29.620
В.e. than the wavelength

31:31.060 --> 31:33.020
В.e. of the light

31:33.660 --> 31:35.860
В.e. what actually happens

31:35.860 --> 31:36.980
В.e. the light comes in

31:37.460 --> 31:39.580
В.e. it jiggles the object

31:39.580 --> 31:40.500
В.e. the object then

31:40.860 --> 31:42.860
В.e. re-emits or scatters

31:42.860 --> 31:43.460
В.e. the light

31:43.900 --> 31:45.180
В.e. it does so in this way

31:45.180 --> 31:45.900
В.e. that spreads

31:46.740 --> 31:47.580
В.e. this was all

31:47.580 --> 31:48.620
В.e. very well understood

31:48.620 --> 31:49.340
В.e. before

31:49.580 --> 31:50.540
В.e. quantum mechanics

31:51.380 --> 31:53.180
В.e. but I think it's a nice

31:53.180 --> 31:54.220
В.e. physical illustration

31:54.220 --> 31:55.580
В.e. the uncertainty principle

31:55.580 --> 31:57.140
В.e. this is something

31:57.140 --> 31:57.820
В.e. you cannot

31:57.820 --> 31:58.420
В.e. possibly

31:58.900 --> 31:59.740
В.e. violate

32:00.340 --> 32:00.980
В.e. you cannot

32:00.980 --> 32:01.900
В.e. possibly make

32:02.060 --> 32:02.540
В.e. a plane

32:02.540 --> 32:03.180
В.e. a wave

32:03.180 --> 32:03.940
В.e. by sticking

32:04.220 --> 32:04.820
В.e. a point

32:04.820 --> 32:05.420
В.e. into

32:05.580 --> 32:06.140
В.e. a pond

32:08.580 --> 32:09.260
В.e. however

32:09.260 --> 32:09.980
В.e. I just told you

32:09.980 --> 32:10.580
В.e. that the light

32:10.580 --> 32:11.660
В.e. actually is made out

32:11.660 --> 32:12.020
В.e. out of

32:12.100 --> 32:12.780
В.e. particles

32:13.020 --> 32:13.620
В.e. it's made out

32:13.620 --> 32:14.500
В.e. out of these quanta

32:14.500 --> 32:15.500
В.e. photons

32:16.060 --> 32:17.180
В.e. the problem is

32:17.180 --> 32:19.100
В.e. that particles

32:19.220 --> 32:19.780
В.e. kick

32:20.220 --> 32:20.900
В.e. this light

32:20.900 --> 32:22.060
В.e. is coming in

32:22.140 --> 32:22.900
В.e. it's actually

32:22.900 --> 32:24.340
В.e. a packet of energy

32:25.020 --> 32:25.940
В.e. now you're telling

32:25.940 --> 32:27.340
В.e. that that packet

32:27.340 --> 32:28.140
В.e. is going to

32:29.900 --> 32:30.740
В.e. spread

32:30.740 --> 32:31.980
В.e. according to the wave

32:32.580 --> 32:33.900
В.e. that the packet

32:34.300 --> 32:34.780
В.e. could be

32:34.780 --> 32:35.700
В.e. deflected

32:35.700 --> 32:36.540
В.e. through this

32:36.740 --> 32:37.380
В.e. angle

32:38.220 --> 32:38.700
В.e. theta

32:40.980 --> 32:42.580
В.e. when it's

32:42.580 --> 32:43.420
В.e. deflected

32:43.860 --> 32:44.980
В.e. that gives a kick

32:45.580 --> 32:46.420
В.e. so the light

32:46.420 --> 32:47.020
В.e. was actually

32:47.020 --> 32:47.780
В.e. this particle

32:47.780 --> 32:48.380
В.e. came in

32:48.700 --> 32:49.500
В.e. hit the object

32:49.500 --> 32:50.460
В.e. trying to see

32:51.020 --> 32:51.740
В.e. and

32:53.180 --> 32:54.380
В.e. got

32:55.260 --> 32:56.100
В.e. spread out

32:56.540 --> 32:57.100
В.e. don't know

32:57.100 --> 32:57.980
В.e. where the particle

32:57.980 --> 32:58.420
В.e. is

32:58.420 --> 32:58.900
В.e. it could be

32:58.900 --> 32:59.540
В.e. anywhere

32:59.540 --> 33:00.460
В.e. that's spread

33:00.740 --> 33:01.620
В.e. that's random

33:02.580 --> 33:03.060
В.e. that's what

33:03.060 --> 33:03.740
В.e. quantum mechanic

33:03.740 --> 33:04.060
В.e. says

33:04.060 --> 33:05.140
В.e. that the precise

33:05.140 --> 33:05.500
В.e. angle

33:05.500 --> 33:06.380
В.e goes is random

33:06.740 --> 33:07.900
В.e. because it

33:07.900 --> 33:08.220
В.e. can be

33:08.220 --> 33:08.820
В.e deflected

33:08.820 --> 33:09.620
В.e. any angle

33:09.860 --> 33:11.140
В.e. kicks the particle

33:12.540 --> 33:13.340
В.e. basically what

33:13.340 --> 33:13.860
В.e. that means

33:13.860 --> 33:14.540
В.e. you can go through

33:14.540 --> 33:15.100
В.e. the algebra

33:15.100 --> 33:15.700
В.e. means that

33:15.700 --> 33:17.060
В.e. the uncertainty

33:17.060 --> 33:17.860
В.e. in the position

33:17.860 --> 33:18.620
В.e. of the particle

33:18.620 --> 33:19.620
В.e. you're measuring

33:20.500 --> 33:21.180
В.e. multiplied

33:21.180 --> 33:22.700
В.e. the uncertainty

33:22.700 --> 33:23.660
В.e. in its momentum

33:24.140 --> 33:24.780
В.e. is equal to

33:24.780 --> 33:25.260
В.e. planks

33:25.260 --> 33:26.020
В.e. approximately

33:26.020 --> 33:26.380
В.e. equal to

33:26.380 --> 33:27.260
В.e. planks constant

33:27.900 --> 33:29.100
В.e. so that's

33:29.100 --> 33:29.700
В.e. Heisenberg's

33:29.700 --> 33:30.180
В.e. uncertainty

33:30.180 --> 33:30.660
В.e relation

33:30.660 --> 33:31.380
В.e. it's a direct

33:31.380 --> 33:32.300
В.e consequence

33:32.420 --> 33:33.340
В.e fact that

33:33.340 --> 33:33.380
В.e fact that

33:33.380 --> 33:33.940
В.e light comes

33:33.940 --> 33:34.740
В.e. in packets

33:35.300 --> 33:36.740
В.e. and that

33:36.740 --> 33:37.820
В.e. light is a wave

33:38.100 --> 33:39.260
В.e. and spreads

33:39.780 --> 33:40.300
В.e. this was

33:40.300 --> 33:40.580
В.e. one of

33:40.580 --> 33:41.300
В.e. a number of

33:41.300 --> 33:42.460
В.e. thought experiments

33:42.460 --> 33:42.820
В.e. which

33:42.820 --> 33:43.340
В.e. Heisenberg

33:43.340 --> 33:43.700
В.e. and others

33:43.700 --> 33:44.220
В.e. went through

33:44.220 --> 33:44.820
В.e. to convince

33:44.820 --> 33:45.580
В.e. themselves

33:45.980 --> 33:46.420
В.e. that

33:46.420 --> 33:47.180
В.e. this uncertainty

33:47.180 --> 33:47.700
В.e. principle

33:47.700 --> 33:48.220
В.e. could never

33:48.220 --> 33:49.180
В.e. violated

33:49.900 --> 33:50.620
В.e. it's very

33:50.620 --> 33:51.660
В.e. very drastic

33:51.900 --> 33:52.580
В.e. leads to

33:53.020 --> 33:53.660
В.e. all sorts

33:53.660 --> 33:54.380
В.e. of changes

33:54.380 --> 33:54.860
В.e. the laws

33:54.860 --> 33:55.540
В.e. of physics

33:57.500 --> 33:58.180
В.e. with respect

33:58.180 --> 33:59.260
В.e. to classical physics

34:00.260 --> 34:01.660
В.e. a slight extension

34:01.660 --> 34:02.820
В.e. of this microscope

34:02.820 --> 34:03.260
В.e. pictures

34:03.260 --> 34:04.020
В.e. to ask yourself

34:04.020 --> 34:05.100
В.e. what is the smallest

34:05.100 --> 34:05.940
В.e. possible

34:05.940 --> 34:06.780
В.e. object

34:06.780 --> 34:07.420
В.e. I could ever

34:07.420 --> 34:08.060
В.e. see

34:08.060 --> 34:08.940
В.e. what's the smallest

34:08.940 --> 34:09.900
В.e. possible

34:09.900 --> 34:10.380
В.e. length

34:10.380 --> 34:10.860
В.e. I could ever

34:10.860 --> 34:11.780
В.e see

34:11.780 --> 34:12.500
В.e. So let's send

34:12.500 --> 34:13.140
В.e. a very

34:13.140 --> 34:14.780
В.e. high energy

34:14.780 --> 34:15.260
В.e. short

34:15.260 --> 34:16.460
В.e. wavelength

34:16.460 --> 34:16.820
В.e. packet

34:16.820 --> 34:18.260
В.e. of light

34:18.260 --> 34:21.020
В.e. what happens

34:21.020 --> 34:21.900
В.e. it's

34:21.900 --> 34:22.860
В.e. it comes in

34:22.860 --> 34:24.020
В.e. it's going to

34:24.020 --> 34:24.780
В.e. collide

34:24.860 --> 34:25.420
В.e. with the

34:25.420 --> 34:25.820
В.e. object

34:25.820 --> 34:27.100
В.e. measuring

34:27.100 --> 34:27.980
В.e. the problem is

34:27.980 --> 34:28.740
В.e. you've packed

34:28.740 --> 34:30.460
В.e. a vast amount of energy

34:30.460 --> 34:32.380
В.e. into a short

34:32.380 --> 34:33.420
В.e. a tiny

34:33.420 --> 34:35.100
В.e. region of space

34:35.100 --> 34:36.660
В.e. when that happens

34:36.660 --> 34:37.900
В.e. you get a black hole

34:37.900 --> 34:38.780
В.e. because it

34:38.780 --> 34:40.460
В.e. self-gravitates

34:40.460 --> 34:41.420
В.e. spacetime

34:41.420 --> 34:41.860
В.e. literally

34:41.860 --> 34:43.380
В.e falls inwards

34:43.380 --> 34:44.780
В.e. you get a black hole

34:44.780 --> 34:45.500
В.e. unfortunately

34:45.500 --> 34:46.140
В.e. microscope

34:46.140 --> 34:47.580
В.e doesn't work

34:47.580 --> 34:49.460
В.e. you can't see

34:49.460 --> 34:50.340
В.e. any length

34:50.340 --> 34:50.900
В.e. smaller

34:50.900 --> 34:53.020
В.e. than this length

34:53.020 --> 34:54.460
В.e. because

34:54.460 --> 34:55.300
В.e. the light simply

34:55.300 --> 34:57.700
В.e. wouldn't escape

34:57.700 --> 34:58.900
В.e. to be seen

34:58.900 --> 34:59.500
В.e. so this is

34:59.500 --> 35:00.660
В.e. the plank length

35:00.660 --> 35:02.660
В.e. that

35:02.660 --> 35:03.300
В.e. believe

35:03.300 --> 35:04.100
В.e. Einstein's theory

35:04.100 --> 35:04.900
В.e. of gravity

35:04.900 --> 35:06.300
В.e. believe quantum mechanics

35:06.300 --> 35:09.500
В.e. this is unavoidable

35:09.500 --> 35:10.180
В.e. largest

35:10.180 --> 35:10.860
В.e. visible length

35:10.860 --> 35:11.420
В.e. there's also

35:11.420 --> 35:11.860
В.e. largest

35:11.860 --> 35:12.620
В.e. visible length

35:12.620 --> 35:13.220
В.e. I've told you

35:13.220 --> 35:14.460
В.e. about lambda

35:14.460 --> 35:15.220
В.e. how lambda

35:15.220 --> 35:16.100
В.e. has repulsive

35:16.100 --> 35:17.460
В.e. gravity

35:17.460 --> 35:18.180
В.e. just

35:18.180 --> 35:19.100
В.e. it's just the opposite

35:19.100 --> 35:20.380
В.e. it's just like

35:20.380 --> 35:20.980
В.e. in this case

35:20.980 --> 35:21.820
В.e. we're

35:25.420 --> 35:26.300
В.e. lambda causes

35:26.300 --> 35:27.620
В.e. the universe to expand

35:27.620 --> 35:29.820
В.e. in an

35:29.820 --> 35:30.700
В.e. accelerating

35:30.700 --> 35:31.820
В.e. fashion

35:31.820 --> 35:32.980
В.e. that creates

35:32.980 --> 35:33.460
В.e. what we call

35:33.460 --> 35:34.940
В.e. the lambda horizon

35:34.940 --> 35:36.060
В.e. anything further

35:36.060 --> 35:36.660
В.e. than a certain

35:36.660 --> 35:37.220
В.e. distance

35:37.220 --> 35:37.980
В.e. we will never

35:37.980 --> 35:38.500
В.e. will never see

35:38.500 --> 35:39.100
В.e. it may emit

35:39.100 --> 35:39.500
В.e. light

35:39.500 --> 35:40.900
В.e. it's been

35:40.900 --> 35:41.380
В.e. that

35:41.380 --> 35:41.820
В.e. region

35:41.820 --> 35:42.460
В.e. is being

35:42.460 --> 35:43.100
В.e. accelerated

35:43.100 --> 35:43.700
В.e. away from us

35:43.700 --> 35:44.780
В.e. so fast

35:44.780 --> 35:45.260
В.e. any

35:45.260 --> 35:45.660
В.e. lighted

35:45.660 --> 35:46.060
В.e. admits

35:46.060 --> 35:46.740
В.e. will never

35:46.740 --> 35:47.420
В.e. ever

35:47.420 --> 35:48.980
В.e. reach us

35:48.980 --> 35:49.820
В.e. so this

35:49.820 --> 35:50.580
В.e. is the largest

35:50.580 --> 35:52.140
В.e. visible length

35:52.140 --> 35:52.900
В.e. actually that's

35:52.900 --> 35:53.620
В.e. not

35:53.620 --> 35:54.460
В.e. so different

35:54.460 --> 35:54.740
В.e. than the

35:54.740 --> 35:55.180
В.e. size

35:55.180 --> 35:55.780
В.e. of the region

35:55.780 --> 35:56.180
В.e. now

35:56.180 --> 35:56.660
В.e. see

35:56.660 --> 35:56.900
В.e. in the

35:56.900 --> 35:59.860
В.e. universe

35:59.860 --> 36:00.700
В.e. so gravity

36:00.700 --> 36:02.580
В.e. in both cases

36:02.580 --> 36:03.100
В.e. fixes

36:03.100 --> 36:03.820
В.e. the smallest

36:03.820 --> 36:04.260
В.e. possible

36:04.260 --> 36:05.140
В.e. visible length

36:05.140 --> 36:06.060
В.e. the largest

36:06.060 --> 36:09.300
В.e. largest one

36:09.300 --> 36:10.060
В.e. so coming

36:10.060 --> 36:11.060
В.e. back to

36:11.060 --> 36:12.540
В.e. microscopes

36:12.540 --> 36:12.860
В.e. here's

36:12.860 --> 36:13.180
В.e. the large

36:13.180 --> 36:14.980
В.e. Hadron Collider

36:14.980 --> 36:16.460
В.e. this was

36:16.460 --> 36:18.260
В.e. its big discovery

36:18.260 --> 36:20.380
В.e. Higgs Boson

36:20.380 --> 36:21.020
В.e. which

36:21.020 --> 36:22.020
В.e. I'll show you

36:22.020 --> 36:22.500
В.e. more about

36:22.500 --> 36:23.740
В.e. in a moment

36:23.740 --> 36:25.540
В.e. and my

36:25.540 --> 36:26.620
В.e. colleague in Edinburgh

36:26.620 --> 36:27.540
В.e. is Peter Higgs

36:27.540 --> 36:28.180
В.e. is the person

36:28.180 --> 36:29.620
В.e. who postulated

36:29.620 --> 36:30.900
В.e. Higgs Boson

36:30.900 --> 36:31.860
В.e. standing there

36:31.860 --> 36:32.620
В.e. like he

36:32.620 --> 36:33.260
В.e understands

36:33.260 --> 36:33.500
В.e. understands what's

36:33.500 --> 36:36.180
В.e. going on

36:36.180 --> 36:37.300
В.e. I guarantee

36:37.300 --> 36:39.820
В.e does not

36:39.820 --> 36:40.700
В.e. like me

36:40.700 --> 36:42.460
В.e. is a theorist

36:42.540 --> 36:43.780
В.e. spend our times

36:43.780 --> 36:44.500
В.e. worrying about

36:44.500 --> 36:45.260
В.e. concepts

36:45.260 --> 36:46.740
В.e. issues of principle

36:47.740 --> 36:49.180
В.e. it takes

36:49.180 --> 36:50.380
В.e. real people

36:50.380 --> 36:51.220
В.e. to build

36:51.220 --> 36:52.380
В.e. vast

36:52.380 --> 36:53.180
В.e. experiment

36:53.180 --> 36:53.740
В.e. practical

36:53.740 --> 36:54.500
В.e. people

36:54.500 --> 36:55.580
В.e. to build experiments

36:55.580 --> 36:56.140
В.e. to test

36:56.140 --> 36:56.860
В.e. these ideas

36:56.860 --> 36:57.860
В.e. amazingly

36:57.860 --> 36:58.340
В.e. that is

36:58.340 --> 36:59.060
В.e. what they did

36:59.060 --> 36:59.420
В.e. took

36:59.420 --> 36:59.780
В.e. took about

36:59.780 --> 37:00.660
В.e. 50 years

37:00.660 --> 37:01.500
В.e. of continuous

37:01.500 --> 37:03.340
В.e. development

37:03.340 --> 37:03.740
В.e. to build

37:03.740 --> 37:04.100
В.e. the Large

37:04.100 --> 37:05.180
В.e. Hadron Collider

37:05.180 --> 37:06.180
В.e. when it was built

37:06.180 --> 37:06.980
В.e. Higgs Boson

37:06.980 --> 37:07.980
В.e. was there

37:07.980 --> 37:08.620
В.e. exactly

37:08.620 --> 37:09.380
В.e. where it was

37:09.380 --> 37:10.420
В.e. predicted to be

37:13.020 --> 37:13.660
В.e. So

37:15.500 --> 37:16.540
В.e. this now is

37:16.540 --> 37:18.140
В.e. all known physics

37:18.140 --> 37:18.780
В.e. summarized

37:18.780 --> 37:19.620
В.e. in a single

37:19.620 --> 37:20.380
В.e. equation

37:21.460 --> 37:22.780
В.e. have gravity

37:22.780 --> 37:23.620
В.e. Einstein's theory

37:23.620 --> 37:24.700
В.e. of gravity

37:24.700 --> 37:25.660
В.e. all the forces

37:25.660 --> 37:27.020
В.e. like electromagnetism

37:27.020 --> 37:28.580
В.e. nuclear forces

37:28.580 --> 37:29.700
В.e. all the particles

37:29.700 --> 37:31.060
В.e. described by

37:31.060 --> 37:32.020
В.e. Dirac

37:32.020 --> 37:33.380
В.e. Higgs is very lucky

37:33.380 --> 37:34.420
В.e. gets three

37:34.420 --> 37:35.860
В.e. three terms

37:35.860 --> 37:36.940
В.e. this equation

37:36.940 --> 37:38.060
В.e. The last one includes

37:38.060 --> 37:40.180
В.e. the lambda

37:42.020 --> 37:43.060
В.e. want to point out

37:43.060 --> 37:43.780
В.e. some things

37:43.780 --> 37:44.620
В.e. you'll have noticed

37:44.620 --> 37:47.340
В.e. that Planck's law

37:47.340 --> 37:48.620
В.e. following Boltzmann

37:48.620 --> 37:50.340
В.e. included an exponential

37:50.340 --> 37:51.540
В.e. to the minus

37:53.300 --> 37:54.940
В.e. laws of quantum mechanics

37:54.940 --> 37:55.580
В.e. are the same

37:55.580 --> 37:56.260
В.e. except now

37:56.260 --> 37:58.620
В.e. there's an imaginary number

37:58.620 --> 38:00.180
В.e. i squared

38:00.180 --> 38:01.620
В.e. is minus one

38:01.620 --> 38:02.380
В.e. again we get

38:02.380 --> 38:03.980
В.e. get this exponential

38:03.980 --> 38:05.300
В.e. with an imaginary number

38:05.300 --> 38:06.700
В.e. here's Planck's

38:06.700 --> 38:07.820
В.e. constant H

38:07.820 --> 38:10.420
В.e. it's H over two pi

38:10.420 --> 38:11.940
В.e. H bar

38:11.940 --> 38:13.620
В.e. these are all

38:13.620 --> 38:14.780
В.e. the laws we know

38:16.140 --> 38:17.860
В.e. my current point

38:17.860 --> 38:18.980
В.e. is maybe that's all

38:18.980 --> 38:19.980
В.e. there is

38:19.980 --> 38:21.260
В.e. there is no evidence

38:21.260 --> 38:22.140
В.e. for anything

38:22.140 --> 38:23.340
В.e. beyond this

38:23.340 --> 38:24.940
В.e. the real challenge

38:24.940 --> 38:26.340
В.e. physics now

38:26.340 --> 38:27.300
В.e. is to

38:27.300 --> 38:29.580
В.e. calculate

38:29.580 --> 38:31.780
В.e. all natural processes

38:31.780 --> 38:33.580
В.e. using these laws

38:33.580 --> 38:34.460
В.e. it's changed

38:34.460 --> 38:36.020
В.e. there are no new particles

38:36.020 --> 38:38.460
В.e. I'll justify that

38:38.460 --> 38:39.100
В.e. in a moment

38:39.100 --> 38:40.980
В.e. key points to remember

38:40.980 --> 38:42.460
В.e. there's an i in here

38:42.460 --> 38:44.860
В.e. a strange imaginary number

38:44.860 --> 38:49.820
В.e. there are these particles

38:49.820 --> 38:51.060
В.e. like the electron

38:51.060 --> 38:52.180
В.e. and the quarks

38:52.180 --> 38:55.420
В.e. atomic nuclear

38:55.420 --> 38:57.780
В.e. are made of

38:57.780 --> 38:58.740
В.e. the rest of it

38:58.740 --> 38:59.860
В.e. are all in a sense

38:59.860 --> 39:00.780
В.e. connections

39:00.780 --> 39:02.060
В.e. this is

39:02.060 --> 39:03.060
В.e. this is a precise

39:03.060 --> 39:04.220
В.e. mathematical term

39:04.220 --> 39:05.540
В.e. a connection

39:05.620 --> 39:06.780
В.e. a connection tells you

39:06.780 --> 39:08.620
В.e. how things travel

39:08.620 --> 39:11.460
В.e. how they affect each other

39:11.460 --> 39:12.660
В.e. that seems to be

39:12.660 --> 39:13.580
В.e. that everything else

39:13.580 --> 39:14.660
В.e. is a connection

39:14.660 --> 39:15.580
В.e. you have particles

39:15.580 --> 39:16.700
В.e. then you have gravity

39:16.700 --> 39:17.500
В.e. which connects them

39:17.500 --> 39:19.380
В.e. you have electromagnetism

39:19.380 --> 39:21.500
В.e. which connects them

39:21.500 --> 39:23.020
В.e. that seems to be

39:23.020 --> 39:25.340
В.e. the underlying logic

39:25.340 --> 39:27.380
В.e. the laws of physics

39:27.380 --> 39:30.140
В.e. here it is in more detail

39:30.140 --> 39:31.580
В.e. we have quarks

39:31.580 --> 39:32.660
В.e. atomic nuclear

39:32.660 --> 39:33.660
В.e. are made of

39:33.660 --> 39:34.580
В.e. we have leptons

39:34.580 --> 39:35.500
В.e. like the electron

39:35.500 --> 39:36.660
В.e. like neutrinos

39:37.660 --> 39:39.620
В.e. the Higgs boson

39:39.620 --> 39:40.380
В.e. which couples to

39:40.380 --> 39:41.380
В.e. everybody

39:41.380 --> 39:43.300
В.e. as does gravity

39:43.300 --> 39:44.100
В.e. then we have

39:44.100 --> 39:45.980
В.e. these forces

39:45.980 --> 39:47.220
В.e. the strong weak

39:47.220 --> 39:51.100
В.e. electromagnetic forces

39:52.380 --> 39:53.740
В.e. that seems to be

39:53.740 --> 39:54.940
В.e. all there is

39:54.940 --> 39:57.180
В.e. now so these are

39:57.180 --> 39:57.980
В.e. all the particles

39:57.980 --> 39:58.780
В.e. that we've discovered

39:58.780 --> 40:00.340
В.e. in accelerator laboratories

40:00.340 --> 40:01.500
В.e. as I mentioned CERN

40:01.500 --> 40:03.220
В.e. has not discovered

40:03.220 --> 40:04.260
В.e. anything beyond

40:04.260 --> 40:05.100
В.e. these yet

40:06.380 --> 40:07.500
В.e. there is one

40:08.660 --> 40:09.180
В.e. these are the

40:09.180 --> 40:10.300
В.e. left-handed neutrinos

40:10.300 --> 40:11.340
В.e. you'll notice the

40:11.340 --> 40:12.300
В.e. L here

40:12.300 --> 40:13.060
В.e. we've only ever

40:13.060 --> 40:13.580
В.e. observed

40:13.580 --> 40:15.020
В.e. left-handed neutrinos

40:15.020 --> 40:16.340
В.e. left-handed means

40:16.340 --> 40:17.220
В.e. it's traveling

40:17.220 --> 40:18.420
В.e. along my thumb

40:18.420 --> 40:19.340
В.e. it's spinning

40:19.340 --> 40:20.220
В.e. this way

40:21.180 --> 40:21.860
В.e. that's the only

40:21.860 --> 40:23.020
В.e. ones we've seen

40:24.180 --> 40:25.020
В.e. however

40:25.020 --> 40:25.860
В.e. we want to solve

40:25.860 --> 40:26.340
В.e. the problem of

40:26.340 --> 40:27.540
В.e. the dark matter

40:27.540 --> 40:28.660
В.e. to start off with

40:28.660 --> 40:29.100
В.e. what is the

40:29.100 --> 40:30.140
В.e. dark matter

40:30.140 --> 40:31.860
В.e. oh I should

40:31.860 --> 40:32.660
В.e. mention one

40:32.660 --> 40:33.180
В.e. another thing

40:33.180 --> 40:33.420
В.e. there's a

40:33.420 --> 40:34.300
В.e. puzzle

40:34.300 --> 40:34.500
В.e. there are

40:34.500 --> 40:35.820
В.e. three generations

40:35.820 --> 40:36.140
В.e. right

40:36.140 --> 40:38.420
В.e. this pattern

40:38.420 --> 40:39.500
В.e. up down

40:39.500 --> 40:40.260
В.e. electron

40:40.260 --> 40:40.940
В.e. neutrino

40:40.940 --> 40:42.180
В.e. electron neutrino

40:42.180 --> 40:42.820
В.e. is copied

40:42.820 --> 40:43.820
В.e. three times

40:43.820 --> 40:44.460
В.e. it's quite

40:44.460 --> 40:45.820
В.e. strange

40:45.820 --> 40:47.540
В.e. why is that?

40:47.540 --> 40:48.700
В.e. don't know

40:48.700 --> 40:49.380
В.e. I'm going to tell

40:49.380 --> 40:49.900
В.e. that there

40:49.900 --> 40:50.900
В.e. is an explanation

40:50.900 --> 40:52.220
В.e. now

40:52.220 --> 40:52.620
В.e. it's part

40:52.620 --> 40:53.140
В.e. of this new

40:53.140 --> 40:53.620
В.e. theory

40:53.620 --> 40:54.900
В.e. that we think

40:54.900 --> 40:55.420
В.e. this was

40:55.420 --> 40:55.900
В.e. forced

41:03.140 --> 41:04.620
В.e. the left-handed

41:04.620 --> 41:05.100
В.e. neutrinos

41:05.100 --> 41:05.660
В.e. are not going to

41:05.660 --> 41:06.180
В.e. explain the

41:06.180 --> 41:07.220
В.e. dark matter

41:07.220 --> 41:07.660
В.e. we've

41:07.660 --> 41:08.140
В.e. observed

41:08.140 --> 41:08.620
В.e. all of them

41:08.620 --> 41:09.020
В.e. they have

41:09.020 --> 41:10.100
В.e. have tiny

41:10.100 --> 41:11.180
В.e. masses

41:11.180 --> 41:12.300
В.e. turns

41:12.300 --> 41:12.500
В.e. turns out

41:12.500 --> 41:12.820
В.e. there's a

41:12.820 --> 41:13.380
В.e. simple

41:13.380 --> 41:14.700
В.e. fix

41:14.700 --> 41:14.980
В.e. just

41:14.980 --> 41:15.380
В.e. delete

41:15.380 --> 41:15.540
В.e. delete the

41:15.540 --> 41:16.180
В.e. l

41:16.180 --> 41:16.740
В.e. l

41:16.740 --> 41:17.260
В.e. l

41:17.260 --> 41:18.460
В.e. l

41:18.460 --> 41:18.900
В.e. all right

41:18.900 --> 41:19.500
В.e. imagine

41:19.500 --> 41:20.460
В.e. electrons

41:20.460 --> 41:20.940
В.e. like

41:20.940 --> 41:21.300
В.e. other

41:21.340 --> 41:22.180
В.e. particles

41:22.180 --> 41:22.540
В.e. come in

41:22.540 --> 41:22.940
В.e. left

41:22.940 --> 41:23.940
В.e. right-handed

41:23.940 --> 41:24.740
В.e. versions

41:26.260 --> 41:26.740
В.e. imagine

41:26.740 --> 41:26.940
В.e. imagine that

41:26.940 --> 41:27.300
В.e. you've

41:27.300 --> 41:27.660
В.e. just got

41:27.660 --> 41:28.180
В.e. to add

41:28.180 --> 41:29.020
В.e. right-handed

41:29.020 --> 41:29.460
В.e partners

41:29.460 --> 41:29.780
В.e. to the

41:29.780 --> 41:30.300
В.e left-handed

41:30.300 --> 41:31.180
В.e neutrinos

41:31.180 --> 41:31.420
В.e. that's

41:31.420 --> 41:32.300
В.e. very modest

41:32.300 --> 41:32.340
В.e. modus

41:32.340 --> 41:32.940
В.e. change

41:32.940 --> 41:33.620
В.e. standard

41:33.620 --> 41:34.380
В.e. model

41:34.380 --> 41:35.020
В.e. model

41:35.020 --> 41:36.460
В.e. it's

41:36.460 --> 41:36.980
В.e. suggested

41:36.980 --> 41:38.020
В.e. by symmetry

41:38.020 --> 41:39.100
В.e. because

41:39.100 --> 41:39.820
В.e. now everybody

41:39.820 --> 41:40.180
В.e. has a

41:40.180 --> 41:44.180
А это правильный партнер.

41:44.180 --> 41:46.180
Так что это наиболее известная экстенция.

41:46.180 --> 41:49.180
Это стандартный модель, который был предложен в 1970-х годах.

41:49.180 --> 41:51.180
И это наверное вероятно.

41:51.180 --> 41:53.180
Почему вероятно?

41:53.180 --> 41:56.180
Потому что, если эти правильные нутриношки

41:56.180 --> 42:00.180
были вероятно, то мы бы не увидели их в экспериментах.

42:00.180 --> 42:04.180
Но они объяснили, почему нутриношки, которые мы видим,

42:04.180 --> 42:06.180
имеют небольшую массу.

42:06.180 --> 42:08.180
Они не массового масса.

42:08.180 --> 42:11.180
И это значит, что нутриношки могут путешествовать

42:11.180 --> 42:13.180
вместе с нутриношками

42:13.180 --> 42:15.180
и transmute в нутриношку.

42:15.180 --> 42:17.180
Это очень тяжелое.

42:17.180 --> 42:20.180
И это вызывает много энергии.

42:20.180 --> 42:23.180
Так что вы не можете перестануть нутриношку.

42:23.180 --> 42:25.180
Это вероятно нутриношка.

42:25.180 --> 42:27.180
Вы оцениваете в это,

42:27.180 --> 42:29.180
для очень небольшого момента времени,

42:29.180 --> 42:32.180
в принципе, в инверции массы.

42:32.180 --> 42:36.180
И потом вы должны оценивать в нутриношку.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.180
После этого,

42:37.180 --> 42:40.180
и в то, что вы и мы видим,

42:40.180 --> 42:42.180
это ст assumed.

42:42.180 --> 42:44.180
И на cảע 2013 года,

illafer と latest ...

42:46.180 --> 42:48.180
feit of malls

42:48.180 --> 42:50.180
там, и есть они choices.

42:50.180 --> 42:52.180
И как It's hard ever,

42:52.180 --> 42:55.180
searching for a mechanism

42:55.180 --> 42:58.180
for открытуб recipe

42:58.180 --> 42:59.180
?

42:59.180 --> 43:00.180
What,

43:00.180 --> 43:01.180
But,

43:01.180 --> 43:03.180
hey,

43:03.180 --> 43:05.180
sir,,

43:05.180 --> 43:07.180
это просто Perfect Dark Matter Кандидат,

43:07.180 --> 43:09.180
потому что они не стремятся

43:09.180 --> 43:11.180
к светлому или другому вооружению,

43:11.180 --> 43:13.180
что мы знаем о том.

43:13.180 --> 43:15.180
Они только стремятся

43:15.180 --> 43:17.180
к гравитой и к этой хиггой.

43:17.180 --> 43:19.180
Так что эти правильные андонитрии

43:19.180 --> 43:21.180
могут быть Dark Matter.

43:21.180 --> 43:23.180
И мы нашли, что мы могли объяснить,

43:23.180 --> 43:25.180
так что теперь это начинается

43:25.180 --> 43:27.180
получать космологическое.

43:27.180 --> 43:29.180
Примечательно, как вы объяснили

43:29.180 --> 43:31.180
их абонент в мире?

43:31.180 --> 43:33.180
Как вы объяснили это?

43:33.180 --> 43:35.180
Мы нашли объяснение о их абонентах.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.180
Если мы assumим, что

43:37.180 --> 43:39.180
универсия была invariанная

43:39.180 --> 43:41.180
под другую симметрию,

43:41.180 --> 43:43.180
которая называется CPT.

43:43.180 --> 43:45.180
CPT — это самая основная симметрия,

43:45.180 --> 43:47.180
известная в физике.

43:47.180 --> 43:49.180
Она говорит, если я беру

43:49.180 --> 43:51.180
систему, и для каждого партика

43:51.180 --> 43:53.180
я расположу это с антипартикой.

43:53.180 --> 43:55.180
И я вверховываю

43:55.180 --> 43:57.180
и вернусь в то время,

43:57.180 --> 43:59.180
что должно быть симметрия

43:59.180 --> 44:01.180
для системы.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.180
Но это будет

44:03.180 --> 44:05.180
действовать в идентичной манере.

44:05.180 --> 44:07.180
Итак, есть

44:07.180 --> 44:09.180
CPT-симметрия.

44:09.180 --> 44:11.180
Симметрия

44:11.180 --> 44:13.180
является, что универсия

44:13.180 --> 44:15.180
рассчитывает эту симметрию.

44:15.180 --> 44:17.180
Это симметрия фундаментной лошади.

44:17.180 --> 44:19.180
Универсия

44:19.180 --> 44:21.180
мог бы и рассчитать или вернуть.

44:21.180 --> 44:23.180
Что если бы это рассчитать?

44:23.180 --> 44:25.180
Если бы это рассчитать,

44:25.180 --> 44:27.180
то для нашей материи

44:27.180 --> 44:29.180
универсий, мы получили более материи

44:29.180 --> 44:31.180
универсией.

44:31.180 --> 44:33.180
Есть быть партнер,

44:33.180 --> 44:35.180
который имеет более антиматер.

44:35.180 --> 44:37.180
Матер.

44:37.180 --> 44:39.180
Время будет в opposite

44:39.180 --> 44:41.180
направлении для партнера.

44:41.180 --> 44:43.180
Но

44:43.180 --> 44:45.180
то же самое,

44:45.180 --> 44:47.180
что в размере

44:47.180 --> 44:49.180
универсией, когда это

44:49.180 --> 44:51.180
рассчитает до 0 на БигБанге,

44:51.180 --> 44:53.180
это так линиально

44:53.180 --> 44:55.180
в времени.

44:55.180 --> 44:57.180
И если это рассчитать линиально,

44:57.180 --> 44:59.180
то можно просто рассчитать.

44:59.180 --> 45:00.180
Это называется аналитическая

45:00.180 --> 45:01.180
континуация.

45:01.180 --> 45:02.180
Это универсия.

45:02.180 --> 45:04.180
И, в принципе, можно продолжить

45:04.180 --> 45:05.180
в правой стороны

45:05.180 --> 45:06.180
универсией,

45:06.180 --> 45:08.180
в левом стороне,

45:08.180 --> 45:10.180
через БигБангс-сингюнарию.

45:10.180 --> 45:12.180
Так, это возможность.

45:12.180 --> 45:14.180
Если вы делаете это,

45:14.180 --> 45:16.180
в том числе, вы предыдущите

45:16.180 --> 45:17.180
объемы

45:17.180 --> 45:18.180
для материи.

45:18.180 --> 45:19.180
О, я бы сказал,

45:19.180 --> 45:21.180
вы видите,

45:21.180 --> 45:23.180
это как метод

45:23.180 --> 45:24.180
из образа.

45:24.180 --> 45:26.180
В физике, если у вас есть

45:26.180 --> 45:27.180
линия,

45:27.180 --> 45:28.180
и вы хотите absolвировать

45:28.180 --> 45:29.180
эффекты для материи

45:29.180 --> 45:30.180
в присутствии материи,

45:30.180 --> 45:31.180
то есть два ways

45:31.180 --> 45:32.180
для этого.

45:32.180 --> 45:33.180
То есть,

45:33.180 --> 45:34.180
вы фигураете,

45:34.180 --> 45:35.180
как много линия

45:35.180 --> 45:36.180
выживаете в линии,

45:36.180 --> 45:38.180
и это сбавляет

45:38.180 --> 45:39.180
от материи,

45:39.180 --> 45:40.180
в том числе,

45:40.180 --> 45:41.180
по предыдущей

45:41.180 --> 45:42.180
структуре,

45:42.180 --> 45:43.180
и потом вернется.

45:43.180 --> 45:45.180
Или вы делаете что-то simpler,

45:45.180 --> 45:46.180
то есть, вы делаете

45:46.180 --> 45:47.180
карбонный копий

45:47.180 --> 45:48.180
для себя,

45:48.180 --> 45:49.180
и если вы правой стороны,

45:49.180 --> 45:50.180
вы делаете левом стороне,

45:50.180 --> 45:51.180
на другом стороне

45:51.180 --> 45:52.180
материи,

45:52.180 --> 45:53.180
вы выживаете материю,

45:53.180 --> 45:54.180
и вы просто собираете линию

45:54.180 --> 45:55.180
от одного копия

45:55.180 --> 45:56.180
к другому.

45:56.180 --> 45:58.180
Это то, что это делается.

45:58.180 --> 46:00.180
Так, это просто

46:00.180 --> 46:02.180
метод работы

46:02.180 --> 46:03.180
к космологии,

46:03.180 --> 46:04.180
в том числе,

46:04.180 --> 46:06.180
чтобы импозировать

46:06.180 --> 46:07.180
структур,

46:07.180 --> 46:09.180
который обращается к CPT.

46:09.180 --> 46:11.180
Так, нет реалити

46:11.180 --> 46:12.180
к предыдущей структуре,

46:12.180 --> 46:13.180
это просто

46:13.180 --> 46:14.180
комфортная математическая

46:14.180 --> 46:16.180
структура.

46:16.180 --> 46:18.180
Так, в этом виде,

46:18.180 --> 46:19.180
большая структурка

46:19.180 --> 46:20.180
была мэра,

46:20.180 --> 46:22.180
специальная структурка,

46:22.180 --> 46:23.180
но она довольно уникальная.

46:23.180 --> 46:25.180
Это такая мэра,

46:25.180 --> 46:26.180
которая реликус think

46:26.180 --> 46:27.180
similarities

46:27.180 --> 46:29.180
explain

46:29.180 --> 46:31.180
All right and you,

46:31.180 --> 46:32.180
but you know,

46:32.180 --> 46:33.180
turnout in this picture you can

46:33.180 --> 46:34.180
calculate how many are produced.

46:34.180 --> 46:35.180
They produced this

46:35.180 --> 46:36.180
Hawking radiation

46:36.180 --> 46:38.180
from the big bang itself.

46:38.180 --> 46:40.180
And we can predict exactly

46:40.180 --> 46:42.180
what their abundance is.

46:42.180 --> 46:43.180
There's one adjustable parameter,

46:43.180 --> 46:45.180
which is their mass.

46:45.180 --> 46:47.180
If it happens to be this big,

46:47.180 --> 46:48.180
which is much bigger

46:48.180 --> 46:49.180
than the mass of a proton,

46:49.180 --> 46:51.180
they account for the dark matter.

46:51.180 --> 46:52.180
And this is the simplest

46:52.180 --> 46:54.820
И это просто-современная объяснение.

46:54.820 --> 46:58.200
Это не значит, что это вероятно, потому что я нужна

46:58.200 --> 47:01.900
для того, чтобы сделать предыдущие и проверить это.

47:01.900 --> 47:04.660
Благословенно, есть предыдущие.

47:04.660 --> 47:07.860
Если один из этих правительных нутрино,

47:07.860 --> 47:10.740
и есть три, как и остальные,

47:10.740 --> 47:12.540
если один из них стабиль,

47:12.540 --> 47:16.780
это означает, что лучший нутрино именно массовый.

47:16.780 --> 47:19.100
И вы можете видеть это с этой картой,

47:19.220 --> 47:22.580
потому что если правительный нутрино стабиль,

47:22.580 --> 47:25.060
то значит, вы должны выключить эту вероятно.

47:25.060 --> 47:29.180
Возможно, это будет декей в левом и хигом.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.340
Так что мы выключаем это,

47:31.340 --> 47:33.820
но если мы выключаем эту вероятно,

47:33.820 --> 47:36.980
мы также выключаем это, это то же вероятно.

47:36.980 --> 47:40.180
Так что этот левом нутрино не может быть с правительным.

47:40.180 --> 47:42.300
Так что этот нутрино массовый.

47:42.300 --> 47:44.260
И так вот это предыдущение.

47:44.260 --> 47:47.020
И, невозможно, это теперь тестово.

47:47.020 --> 47:49.980
То, что массовые нутрино,

47:49.980 --> 47:52.700
они теперь приобретены,

47:52.700 --> 47:56.660
через их влияние на стабиль.

47:56.660 --> 48:00.020
И так, лучшие галактические сервисы сейчас,

48:00.020 --> 48:02.660
один, который называется «Нуклад», это саталлайт.

48:02.660 --> 48:05.100
Европейская агентская саталлита.

48:05.100 --> 48:09.900
И большая сервисная сервиса «Спейс-Тайм» в Чилле.

48:09.900 --> 48:12.180
Эти сервисы сейчас приобретены на стабиль,

48:12.180 --> 48:14.060
и галактические сервисы.

48:14.140 --> 48:17.260
Они должны быть able to test this hypothesis.

48:17.260 --> 48:19.540
Так что мы увидим, что это и правда,

48:19.540 --> 48:21.740
если это и правда, то это массово.

48:21.740 --> 48:23.500
Тогда это становится легко,

48:23.500 --> 48:26.500
что это первая конвинция теории «Нуклад».

48:26.500 --> 48:27.900
В моем случае.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.460
Ок, так что я вернулся к этому.

48:31.460 --> 48:33.340
«Галактическая сервиса» – это галактическая сервиса,

48:33.340 --> 48:36.820
она была специальна стабильной стабильной агентской сервисы.

48:36.820 --> 48:39.100
«Галактическая сервиса» выключена линиально.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.980
Это было предназначено от Роджа Пенроу,

48:41.980 --> 48:46.260
который был предназначен в 1970-х годах.

48:46.260 --> 48:48.460
Пенроу изменили hypothesis,

48:48.460 --> 48:50.060
что initial singularity,

48:50.060 --> 48:51.140
это вещь, где все «спейс»

48:51.140 --> 48:53.700
приводят к «поинт»,

48:53.700 --> 48:56.740
это «конформал».

48:56.740 --> 49:03.060
Конформал означает, что «лайк» не видит.

49:03.060 --> 49:06.540
Лайк вверх – вы видите, что они вверх вверх.

49:06.540 --> 49:07.660
Они все, в принципе,

49:07.660 --> 49:10.620
копия именно так же.

49:10.700 --> 49:15.700
Лайк вверх не знает о том, что вверх вверх.

49:15.700 --> 49:17.460
Эквасть, которая подходит,

49:17.460 --> 49:20.140
она вверх вверх вверх.

49:20.140 --> 49:22.820
Лайк вверх «конформал».

49:22.820 --> 49:25.060
Пенроу изменили hypothesis,

49:25.060 --> 49:27.300
что «бигбанг» был «конформал».

49:27.300 --> 49:30.340
Если все вверх вверх behaved как «лайк»

49:30.340 --> 49:31.620
в «бигбанг»,

49:31.620 --> 49:34.500
то ничего не будет осознанным.

49:34.500 --> 49:37.060
Ничего вверх вверх вверх вверх.

49:37.060 --> 49:39.340
Не будет осознанным, что есть вверх.

49:39.340 --> 49:43.700
Потому что они не обожают, что вверх вверх вверх вверх.

49:43.700 --> 49:46.140
«конформал» так же.

49:46.140 --> 49:49.460
Если я беру квадрат,

49:49.460 --> 49:54.260
и пытаюсь высказывать это в круг,

49:54.260 --> 49:55.380
пытаюсь высказывать,

49:55.380 --> 49:57.820
в кругу вверх вверх,

49:57.820 --> 49:59.780
я могу это сделать в таком виде,

49:59.780 --> 50:02.140
как я обожаю англины.

50:02.140 --> 50:05.540
Это называется «конформал» маппинг.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.940
Если вы посмотрите, вы увидите,

50:06.940 --> 50:09.140
что англины на все эти вверх вверх

50:09.300 --> 50:10.900
oin Driving.

50:10.900 --> 50:12.980
Они interest,

50:12.980 --> 50:16.660
но они �-то match.

50:16.660 --> 50:19.300
«конформал» такой Dav вот такой.

50:19.300 --> 50:21.580
Если вы выигрываете,

50:21.580 --> 50:24.700
если он seriousnessyon,

50:24.700 --> 50:28.140
ты поймите את по является lakh.

50:28.140 --> 50:30.660
От жи object спис out.

50:30.660 --> 50:33.900
Это closest contact hands.

50:33.900 --> 50:36.620
От по числе.

50:36.620 --> 50:38.900
«конформал»指щин по french.

50:38.900 --> 50:45.900
и, да, это мое удовольствие, чтобы иметь чару в его имя.

50:45.900 --> 50:48.900
Индивидуальный человек.

50:48.900 --> 50:52.900
И здесь есть еще один из его красивых фотографий.

50:52.900 --> 50:58.900
Пенроз упоминал, что difficulty

50:58.900 --> 51:04.900
в объяснении, почему универсия так простая на больших scales.

51:05.900 --> 51:09.900
Как я уже говорил, в каждом направлении, мы смотрим в универсию,

51:09.900 --> 51:11.900
универсия практически одинаковая.

51:11.900 --> 51:14.900
Она просто варьет из этих рандомных вейвов,

51:14.900 --> 51:17.900
в которых амплитут есть только 10-5.

51:17.900 --> 51:21.900
Это, в основном, очень универсия, очень асоторопия,

51:21.900 --> 51:23.900
очень...

51:24.900 --> 51:27.900
Это очень-очень специальная геометрия.

51:27.900 --> 51:32.900
Это не варь и конвелута.

51:32.900 --> 51:35.900
Итак, здесь универсия, который делает универсию

51:35.900 --> 51:39.900
и выбирает эту очень специальную геометрию,

51:39.900 --> 51:42.900
в которой мы видим, для универсия.

51:42.900 --> 51:45.900
И он объясняет, что это пузл.

51:45.900 --> 51:48.900
Итак, что я сейчас говорю,

51:48.900 --> 51:51.900
я думаю, что у нас есть soluция для этого пузла.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.900
Мы знаем, почему универсия так простая и простая.

51:54.900 --> 51:56.900
И причина это...

51:56.900 --> 51:59.900
Я имею в виду, что это оборудование идеи

51:59.900 --> 52:01.900
Стивен Хоркин и других.

52:01.900 --> 52:03.900
Но причина это, в основном,

52:03.900 --> 52:06.900
так же, как причина, что газа в этом доме

52:06.900 --> 52:08.900
является геометрией и асоторопией.

52:08.900 --> 52:11.900
Почему аэрмоликулы так смутно выживаются?

52:11.900 --> 52:13.900
И это хорошая вещь, потому что, если они все

52:13.900 --> 52:16.900
выживали в сторону, мы не могли бы оборудоваться.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.900
Они не делают это.

52:18.900 --> 52:19.900
И почему не?

52:19.900 --> 52:21.900
Просто рандомность.

52:21.900 --> 52:23.900
Это просто, что есть много более

52:23.900 --> 52:25.900
возможностей для моликулы,

52:25.900 --> 52:27.900
чтобы они смутно выживались,

52:27.900 --> 52:29.900
чем для них, чтобы они все были в одну сторону.

52:29.900 --> 52:31.900
И это энтропия.

52:31.900 --> 52:33.900
Максимальная энтропия

52:33.900 --> 52:35.900
объясняет хомогенеи

52:35.900 --> 52:37.900
аэрмоликулы.

52:37.900 --> 52:39.900
Это термодинамика.

52:39.900 --> 52:41.900
Вы не нуждите механизма.

52:41.900 --> 52:43.900
Это просто, что происходит,

52:43.900 --> 52:45.900
в большинстве времени.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.900
Так что, я буду показать,

52:47.900 --> 52:49.900
что у нас есть объяснение

52:49.900 --> 52:51.900
для геометрии геометрии,

52:51.900 --> 52:53.900
которая имеет такие характеристики.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.900
Термодинамика не требует механизма.

52:55.900 --> 52:57.900

53:25.920 --> 53:30.920
Блэк-холлс – hundreds of solar masses in size.

53:30.920 --> 53:36.920
So, actually much more than that, millions of solar masses.

53:36.920 --> 53:41.920
A black hole has a temperature, which called a Hawking temperature.

53:41.920 --> 53:45.920
And so this was a huge surprise that black holes are slightly hot.

53:45.920 --> 53:49.920
It's a very tiny temperature, but they're slightly hot.

53:49.920 --> 53:52.920
More importantly, they have an entropy.

53:52.920 --> 53:57.920
Рафлеспеки нынешний говорит, что вы могли бы сделать это блэк-холлс.

53:57.920 --> 54:04.920
Энтрибрэк-холлс – proportional to the area of the surface of the black hole.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.920
Here is Stephen Hawking at Perimeter.

54:07.920 --> 54:11.920
The Stephen Hawking Center was under construction.

54:11.920 --> 54:15.920
He visited a number of times.

54:15.920 --> 54:21.920
He was treated exceptionally well in the bistro, I must say, which he enjoyed.

54:21.920 --> 54:27.920
And was absolutely inspiring to have visit.

54:27.920 --> 54:31.920
Here he is with somebody else you may recognize,

54:31.920 --> 54:35.920
who the founder of Perimeter Institute, Mike Lazaridis,

54:35.920 --> 54:40.920
and we're out on Lake Huron during one of Stephen's visits.

54:40.920 --> 54:45.920
They both look very cool.

54:45.920 --> 54:50.920
So Hawking used a very profound mathematical trick,

54:50.920 --> 54:54.920
which I mentioned this I, this imaginary number,

54:54.920 --> 54:57.920
that distinguished the Boltzmann type,

54:57.920 --> 55:01.920
the thermodynamic arguments from the quantum arguments,

55:01.920 --> 55:05.920
and Hawking used that trick to relate the two.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.920
And the way he related them is by making time,

55:09.920 --> 55:12.920
by calculating in imaginary time.

55:12.920 --> 55:16.920
It sounds very speculative, but it's not.

55:16.920 --> 55:19.920
It's a very precise technique.

55:19.920 --> 55:22.920
He used imaginary time to calculate the Hawking temperature

55:22.920 --> 55:25.920
and gravitational entropy of a black hole.

55:25.920 --> 55:29.920
Now, essentially what he did is he took the spacetime of a black hole,

55:29.920 --> 55:34.920
which is a function of, which has a certain description

55:34.920 --> 55:37.920
in terms of real time and real space.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.920
And he said, what if time goes imaginary?

55:39.920 --> 55:42.920
It turns out, when time goes imaginary,

55:42.920 --> 55:45.920
the black hole is actually periodic in imaginary time.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.920
It repeats itself in imaginary time.

55:48.920 --> 55:51.920
And that's the signal of a temperature.

55:51.920 --> 55:56.920
If you have a system, which is periodic in imaginary time,

55:56.920 --> 55:59.920
the period actually defines a temperature,

55:59.920 --> 56:03.920
and that's at least one way to calculate the Hawking temperature.

56:03.920 --> 56:07.920
And the entropy calculated similarly.

56:07.920 --> 56:11.920
So recently we were able to do the same for cosmology.

56:11.920 --> 56:15.920
Calculate the Hawking temperature and the entropy for cosmology.

56:15.920 --> 56:17.920
I'll show you a simple example first,

56:17.920 --> 56:19.920
and then I'll show you the general case.

56:19.920 --> 56:23.920
So this was done by Hawking and collaborators.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.920
A cosmos with only lambda.

56:26.920 --> 56:29.920
This, in fact, was Einstein's first model of cosmology.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.920
Let's only have lambda and gravity.

56:31.920 --> 56:34.920
Well, it's repulsive, and so the universe,

56:34.920 --> 56:38.920
if it's a big circle in this case,

56:38.920 --> 56:41.920
I'm only plotting one dimension of space,

56:41.920 --> 56:44.920
so it's a circle, it shrinks and re-expands

56:44.920 --> 56:46.920
because of the repulsion.

56:46.920 --> 56:49.920
Okay, that's called De Sitter spacetime.

56:49.920 --> 56:52.920
And when you make time imaginary,

56:52.920 --> 56:54.920
the spacetime, time goes up,

56:54.920 --> 56:58.920
the time now becomes periodic.

56:58.920 --> 57:02.920
And so this is what Hawking called a gravitational instanton.

57:02.920 --> 57:06.920
It's the imaginary time version of De Sitter spacetime.

57:06.920 --> 57:08.920
It has a temperature,

57:08.920 --> 57:13.920
which is just the length of a great circle on that sphere,

57:13.920 --> 57:18.920
and it has an entropy, which you can calculate.

57:18.920 --> 57:21.920
So recently we were able to solve Einstein's equations

57:21.920 --> 57:25.920
for general cosmology with radiation,

57:25.920 --> 57:32.920
matter, curved spatially and lambda analytically,

57:32.920 --> 57:36.920
and we discovered it looks somewhat like this.

57:36.920 --> 57:40.920
It's not a sphere anymore, it's distorted.

57:40.920 --> 57:46.920
And so here's the imaginary time cosmos,

57:46.920 --> 57:49.920
from which you can calculate the entropy,

57:49.920 --> 57:51.920
and the real time cosmos you can think of,

57:51.920 --> 57:56.920
sort of sprouting out of the imaginary one.

57:56.920 --> 57:57.920
Why this is interesting,

57:57.920 --> 58:00.920
because it turns out that this gravitational entropy,

58:00.920 --> 58:02.920
if it is an entropy,

58:02.920 --> 58:04.920
just like the entropy of gas in a room,

58:04.920 --> 58:08.920
it tells you which cosmologies are more likely.

58:08.920 --> 58:12.920
And the ones which are most likely, according to this formula,

58:12.920 --> 58:15.920
are spatially flat, just like we see,

58:15.920 --> 58:19.920
homogeneous isotropic and isotropic.

58:19.920 --> 58:23.920
And secondly, this calculation also favors

58:23.920 --> 58:26.920
that the cosmological constant is small and positive,

58:26.920 --> 58:29.920
which is just as we see.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.920
So this is still very new,

58:31.920 --> 58:35.920
we're arguing lots of other experts what this means,

58:35.920 --> 58:39.920
but in my view, this is a thermodynamic explanation

58:39.920 --> 58:42.920
for the large-scale geometry of the universe,

58:42.920 --> 58:46.920
so we don't need smoothing or flattening mechanisms,

58:46.920 --> 58:48.920
some of you may have heard of inflation,

58:48.920 --> 58:53.920
which is a postulated period of very rapid expansion,

58:53.920 --> 58:56.920
just after the Big Bang Singularity,

58:56.920 --> 59:01.920
we don't seem to need that.

59:01.920 --> 59:06.920
Now, our telescopes are also microscopes,

59:06.920 --> 59:09.920
and as we look out in space,

59:09.920 --> 59:12.920
we are looking back in time.

59:12.920 --> 59:14.920
The universe is shrinking,

59:14.920 --> 59:16.920
that's what this picture shows,

59:16.920 --> 59:20.920
so currently the radius is 20 gigaparsecs, let's say,

59:20.920 --> 59:24.920
we shrink that region back to the Big Bang,

59:24.920 --> 59:27.920
it's about 10 microns,

59:27.920 --> 59:29.920
and then if I take that same region

59:29.920 --> 59:33.920
and follow it forward into somebody's eye,

59:33.920 --> 59:35.920
that's what we see.

59:35.920 --> 59:40.920
So this is the largest visible region of the universe,

59:40.920 --> 59:43.920
the one in green.

59:43.920 --> 59:46.920
Of course, as we're looking backward in time,

59:46.920 --> 59:49.920
the universe is smaller,

59:49.920 --> 59:55.920
what that means is that a structure that was only a plank length,

59:55.920 --> 59:58.920
or a wave that was only a plank length across,

59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.920
at the plank time, the smallest conceivable length,

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.920
right now would be about a millimeter across,

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.920
it would have expanded to about a millimeter.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.920
If we can capture gravitational waves

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.920
on millimeter scales,

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.920
literally we can look at the Big Bang,

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920
we can look at the Singularity.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.920
So that's very exciting,

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.920
these are still being developed,

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.920
it's very likely going to be decades

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.920
before this is feasible,

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.920
but there are actually prototypes already.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.920
So, I want to now explain,

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.920
what I'm moving towards is explaining two things.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.920
One, why there are three families,

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.920
I told you that would be explained,

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.920
three generations of particles,

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.920
and two, where did these waves,

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.920
the density waves come from,

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920
that we see in the sky?

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.920
Did they somehow originate

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.920
at the Big Bang Singularity itself,

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.920
and then move forward,

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.920
and end up leading to the formation of galaxies,

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.920
and stars, and so on.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.920
So, I'm going to explain that.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.920
Now, to understand that,

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.920
we have to understand how

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.920
the standard model couples to gravity,

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.920
and currently there's a very fundamental paradox,

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.920
in that coupling,

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.920
which is that the standard model fields,

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.920
electromagnetism, the electron fields,

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.920
all the other fields,

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.920
fluctuate in the vacuum, in empty space.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.920
The reason for those fluctuations

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.920
are basically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.920
If you try to set them zero,

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.920
then they're,

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.920
if you set their, essentially their position to zero,

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.920
their coordinate,

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.920
the amplitude of the wave to zero,

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.920
then its velocity is indeterminate.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.920
You cannot set them to zero

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.920
and be consistent with this Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.920
This is a picture of what's going on

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.920
in the vacuum right now,

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.920
with either, like, this is actually

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.920
for the strong interactions,

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.920
but it would be the same for electromagnetism

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.920
or other fields.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.920
Unfortunately, the energy

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.920
in these zero point fluctuations is infinite.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.920
And that's a problem,

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.920
but how do you couple it to gravity?

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.920
So, we have various procedures

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.920
to ignore that,

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.920
but they are rather artificial

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.920
and they leave you very confused.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.920
Somehow, something's going on in the vacuum,

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.920
which seems deeply paradoxical.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.920
They also turn out to spoil this conformal symmetry

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.920
and so therefore we cannot

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.920
describe the Big Bang.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.920
So, our starting point was actually

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.920
to take a clue from cosmology

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.920
what kind of field, if it fluctuated,

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.920
would lead to a pattern

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.920
like the one we see on the sky.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.920
And turns out there's a unique answer.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.920
It's a dimension zero field.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.920
It's basically a field

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.920
that is dimensionless.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.920
So, if you ask for its correlations

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.920
of this field,

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.920
it correlates on,

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.920
there's no scale.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.920
Just like the fluctuations we see

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.920
roughly the same strength on all scale,

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.920
that's what this field has.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920
And actually, these fields

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.920
had been thought of before

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.920
and they were shown to be

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.920
a simple gauge theory in the 80s.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.920
So, here the standard model particles,

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.920
what we discovered is if we add

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.920
36 precisely

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.920
of these extra dimension zero fields

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.920
and you may wonder where the 36 comes from

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.920
and the clue is that there's six of these

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.920
and six of those,

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.920
but I'm not going to say any more.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.920
Turns out these exactly cancel the zero point energy

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.920
and they also restore the conformal symmetry.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:08.920
These are highly non-trivial cancellations

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.920
and furthermore it only works

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.920
if they're three generations.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.920
So, this is a very new discovery.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.920
We're trying to still make sense of it.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.920
These dimension zero fields are peculiar

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.920
because they just change the vacuum,

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.920
but they don't have any particles.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.920
So, not adding anything,

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.920
you're just adjusting the vacuum

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.920
of the standard model

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.920
so that it doesn't have these violent energy fluctuations

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.920
and it's consistent with this conformal symmetry

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.920
that would allow you to describe the Big Bang.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.920
Бased on this, we were able to predict the amplitude

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.920
and here it is, a big formula,

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.920
but you see it all sorts of pys and fives

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.920
and numbers, the number of degrees of freedom

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.920
in the standard model.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.920
These alphas are couplings

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.920
which are measured in experiments like CERN

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.920
but the principles have explained

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.920
that we want this conformal symmetry

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.920
because we want to describe the Big Bang

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.920
where apparently the universe was at zero size.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.920
So, we worked out all these numbers.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.920
This one in particular is interesting

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.920
because alpha-3 is the strong coupling constant.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.920
We extrapolate it to the Planck scale.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.920
It's a huge extrapolation in energy

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.920
and it turns out it is what is called a critical exponent.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.920
In other words, I told you there was a tilt,

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.920
waves get slightly longer as you go to long wavelengths.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.920
This is how much stronger they get

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.920
and this tilt has to be compared with 0.04.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.920
So, it turns out we plugged in this number

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.920
from the CERN measurements, extrapolating the CERN measurements.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:57.920
The Planck scale in this number is exactly very close to 0.04.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.920
So, our prediction is 0.042.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.920
This is the measurement from the Planck satellite.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:09.920
So, that's just a first principles explanation.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.920
A lot more theoretical work is needed

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.920
to confirm this, to calculate corrections,

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.920
make sure they're under control.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.920
Observations are also improving.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.920
If this agreement holds up,

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.920
then the theory will become compelling.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.920
So, it may be that we have an explanation of all this.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.920
It's all basically in the physics we know,

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:39.920
is that we have to do something to fix up the vacuum a little,

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.920
but otherwise cosmology is all under control.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.920
So, thank you for listening.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:07:07.920
АПЛОДИСМЕНТЫ

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.920
Alright, thank you, Neil.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.920
So captivated.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.920
I almost forgot to stand up to do the Q&A.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.920
So, we will now take some questions,

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.920
both from the online audience and from the audience here.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.920
If you have a question, please come down to the microphone

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.920
that is set up here on the stairs.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.920
And we'll just go with the Q

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.920
and I'll bring up the online questions as well.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.920
So, if you're online listening,

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.920
you can add a question with the hashtag PI live.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.920
So, we'll start while we let people come down.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.920
We'll start with an online question.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.920
So, let's see, what do we have?

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.920
Here's one.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.920
So, I think this is a fun one to start with.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.920
Would the mirror universe be an identical reflection to this one

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.920
with a mirror Earth moving,

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.920
with a mirror Neil Tarak giving a mirror lecture?

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.920
No.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:12.920
So, the thing is, you've got to clearly distinguish classical from quantum.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.920
Now, a quantum geometry is a fluctuating thing.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.920
So, when I draw this geometry,

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.920
you shouldn't really picture a single geometry.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.920
You need to picture something that's a bit fuzzy.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.920
And it gets more and more fuzzy near the singularity.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.920
When the universe is small,

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.920
that fuzziness means that could sort of,

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.920
could quote singularity, could actually be moved around.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.920
There's some fuzziness.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.920
The way you impose the CPT symmetry is where the universe is large.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.920
So, if you like, there's a two-sided universe going out on either side.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.920
You impose a symmetry that if I turn the whole thing around,

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.920
there's no difference.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.920
In both cases, there are fluctuations.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.920
So, it's really the CPT symmetry is a quantum symmetry.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.920
You shouldn't think literally that the two sides are carbon copies of each other.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:16.920
So, I think of it more as a sort of mathematical device

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.920
to do something sensible with the singularity.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.920
And you don't do it at the singularity.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.920
Instead, you picture this extended spacetime

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.920
and impose a symmetry on that.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.920
If you flip it around, that's what you do.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920
Thanks.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.920
All right, we have a question from the audience.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.920
Go ahead.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.920
Hello.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.920
I'm not me.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.920
I'm my soon-to-be 87-year-old mom, Doris Matthews from Almyra.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.920
14 years into Alzheimer's

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.920
and her third generation great grandchildren.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.920
The universe from within, from quantum to cosmos.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.920
Everything is a spring.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.920
High frequency compression to low frequency expansion,

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.920
harmonic oscillation.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.920
Everything in our neighborhood.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.920
I'm a kid.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.920
1940.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.920
An imaginary time.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.920
Little girl in our park.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.920
Having a ball.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.920
Seasaws, waves in our sandbox.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.920
It's a blast.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.920
Is it true?

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.920
The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.920
Tell me so I can tell my mom and dad.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.920
And we can tell our neighbors right here

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.920
where we play in our park.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.920
Where Mother Nature teaches us everything.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920
We can't wait.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.920
This is Waterloo.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.920
Our region, our perimeter.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.920
We are you, you are us.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.920
We are one.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.920
Connections.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.920
We are the big bang.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920
The game of life.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.920
Come and play.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.920
Everything's A-OK.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.920
Our wade where the air is sweet.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.920
Mr. Turrick, can you tell me how to get to?

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.920
Сасса миски.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.920
Пожалуйста, спасибо за это.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.920
Я должен сказать, что один из самых замечательных

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.920
Meetings, которые я видел,

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.920
были между Стивен Хоркин и Сидней Пватиэ,

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.920
который, конечно, был легендарным актером.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.920
И они сидели на столе с другом.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.920
И Сидни сказал, что я думаю, что у нас есть.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.920
И Сидни, действительно, Had his own theory.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.920
Он не знал математики и так далее.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Но он абсолютно видел, как он думал, что надо работать.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.920
И это было просто абсолютно fascinating,

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.920
видеть пасшену, с которой он сообщил.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:01.920
И Стивен был довольно встанутым с Сидней.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.920
Мы все имеем наши фотографии.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.920
И она абсолютно права.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.920
Это ничего, но история.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.920
Все физики — это просто история.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.920
Кто-то в нашем конференции, в этом вечере,

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.920
очень хорошо сказал, что это narrative.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.920
Физика — это narrative.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.920
Это что-то, что мы говорим о том,

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.920
о том, как мир behaving.

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.920
Истороннее, что о физике,

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.920
это narrative converges.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.920
Мы можем использовать это.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.920
И это у нас невероятная мощь.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.920
Но в конце концов, это просто история.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.920
Отлично.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.920
У нас есть еще один вопрос от audiences.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.920
Спасибо, профессор Турак, за поговоре.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.920
У меня два вопроса.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.920
Один вопрос — когда мы думаем о том,

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.920
что Биг-Банг происходит 13.8 миллионов лет назад,

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.920
кажется, что революция говорит нам, что время relative.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.920
Так что, может Биг-Банг быть визжанным

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.920
как что-то, которое постоянно происходит,

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.920
как у нас есть своя своя своя спина?

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.920
Как у нас есть постоянный феномен.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.920
Как вы говорите в начале,

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.920
кажется, что это 14 миллионов лет назад,

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.920
но это у нас есть своя своя своя спина.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.920
Ну, когда мы говорим о 14 миллион лет назад,

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.920
то это, как мы говорили,

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.920
hours,

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920
hours,

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.920
hours…

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920
45%

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920
An hour,

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.920
40%

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.920
An hour,

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.920
40%

01:13:50.920 --> 01:14:00.760
сингулярность, это 13.7 миллионов лет, но я не уверен, что я fully understand the question,

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:12.120
но это точно вероятно, что время в General relativity is, you know, is different objects,

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:19.600
different observers see different times, но это мы, вы знаете, мы понимаем, мы

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.840
believe that at the end of the story is remarkably simple.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:30.560
Что кажется, что сингулярность в Бигбанге, это notion of time, я mean,

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.920
if this picture is correct, то notion of time becomes meaningless, почему?

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:42.680
Потому что все это становится светлым, литерально то, что есть свет,

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.520
свет не видит экспансион в мире, свет не видит время, если

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:54.280
ты asks a photon what's the time, a photon will tell you I see the whole universe all of existence

01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:01.640
simultaneous, ок, so photons are pretty amazing things, which have no time,

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:09.600
no notion of time, and that seems to be, if this is right, how you deal with the singularity,

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:16.600
there was no time at the Big Bang, or at least there was nothing around to witness the time.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:25.040
Thank you, and just because you had that sort of the expansion on like the universe that we

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:31.400
observe in your sort of universe, sort of mirror model, and I think Penrose had developed the

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:39.240
conformal cosmic psychology, so I mean, I don't know if that makes any sense from your model,

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:45.560
but as the universe becomes all black holes, and then the radiation and heat death, would that be

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:50.760
where it connects on, like it connects in the middle, but would it connect to the universe at the heat death?

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:57.640
No, I mean, I have the greatest possible respect for Penrose's ideas, and as I indicated,

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:03.760
what we're connecting it is an idea of his from the 70s, which is about the singularity.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.640
Since then, he started to advocate this cyclic universe picture, I think partly influenced by myself

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:17.520
and Paul Steinhardt, because we talked about cyclic, whereas I've abandoned that, it's too complicated,

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.960
he is now advocating it, but the problem is that he doesn't really have a way to match

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.960
the future of our universe to the big bang of the next one.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:37.360
He doesn't have a mathematical prescription for how you, he has a prescription, but it doesn't really work,

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:48.080
and yeah, it's, whereas what we're doing here is this, is called analytic, it means that it's unique,

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:55.280
the connection between these two sides, so, but, you know, we're in discussion about it,

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.040
I'm trying to persuade him that your previous idea was much better than this one,

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.160
but we'll see, I mean, it could well be that he turns out to be right, he has turned out to be right on

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.960
very, very many things. Thank you.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.600
Thank you. All right, we have another question.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:19.040
Thank you very much for the nice talk. I was wondering about one remark, which you made,

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.400
about the production of the right-handed neutrinos, and so if I understood it correctly,

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.200
it would be like a Hawking radiation effect from the early universe, and normally Hawking

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.000
radiation is associated with some kind of horizon, or some cosmological horizon.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.160
If we are now in this regime of very early times and the scale factor is linear,

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:47.600
there's no horizon. Yes, so I met, okay, so it's, it's good you ask. So at some level,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.960
it's totally obvious to suggest the right-handed neutrinos, the dark matter,

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.720
because it doesn't couple to light or other forces. Why wasn't this done in the 70s?

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.480
And the reason was that everybody thought that the abundance of particles are determined by thermal

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:09.280
equilibrium in the hot big bang. If you switch off this coupling so that it's stable and can be

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:15.440
the dark matter, it was never in thermal equilibrium, so they didn't know how to calculate its abundance,

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.520
so they assumed that wasn't the case. And literally, they made the assumption

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:25.120
just so they didn't have to worry about it, okay. Now, so we did worry about it,

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.720
because we wanted it to be the dark matter. And, and then when I said Hawking radiation,

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:36.880
what I really meant is it's the time dependence of the cosmology that creates the particles.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.760
So it's not with a horizon, with a black hole, it's associated with a horizon.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.080
But in general, if space changes, the scale factor changes, you produce particles.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:54.080
It's much more general than having a horizon. And in this case, that's what happens. It's just the,

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.200
the mere fact the universe is changing in size, creates a particle. Thank you.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.760
All right, we have time for a couple more questions. Go ahead.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.560
Hi there. You had mentioned that an explanation for dark matter could be right-handed neutrinos.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.480
Yes. But that relied on a left-handed neutrino being massless.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.000
Yes. My question to you is, have we not measured the mass of a left-handed neutrino to be nonzero?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.720
No, great question. So what has been measured, there are three neutrinos,

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:28.160
three light neutrinos, we know of. The only things that have been measured are the differences

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:35.520
in actually the squares of the masses of those three neutrinos. So we know two numbers.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.560
We know essentially two differences between the light neutrino masses.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:46.240
We do not know the overall scale. So our prediction is that we have these three masses

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:52.080
and the lightest one is massless. So we predict all the masses from that, from the known measurements.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:58.560
And what these galaxy surveys are going to do in the next three to five years is

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:07.120
fix the sum of these neutrino masses. So if they find the sum is essentially

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:13.280
just the sum of those two differences, then it will confirm that the lightest one is massless.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.680
Thank you. That's a great question. All right, let's take one final question from the audience.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.600
Thank you for the lecture. It was amazing. My question is just, you were talking about these sort of

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:31.120
mirror, this sort of mirror universe that is similar to ours at cosmological scales,

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:38.080
but not identical because of fluctuations close to the Big Bang. Feynman sort of had this idea of

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:44.880
electrons and positrons being not separate particles, but merely the same particle traveling in

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:52.240
different directions in time. Could those particles travel between our universe and this

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:59.120
mirror universe through the singularity because, you know, to positron and electron collide?

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:07.040
It's a great question. There is this very fundamental view of antimatter as just being matter that's

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:16.480
struggling backwards in time. And in fact, Feynman, the greatest expert on all this, made the statement

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:21.760
that he believed quantum field theory, which is what we use to describe the standard model,

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:26.240
was nothing but a way of hiding the fact that particles go backwards in time.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:37.360
So, indeed, this CPT is, you see, if I have a particle traveling from A to B with a world line

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:44.400
from it, and that, let's imagine, time goes up and space sideways. So this, the particle can go

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.760
forwards and backwards in time and so on. What is CPT? It's just reversing the arrow on that line.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:53.280
So instead of going from here to there, it goes from here to there, that's CPT.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:02.400
And, indeed, that must be possible. Okay, so somehow we're doing the same thing with the cosmos,

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.640
but one way of picturing this two-sided diagram is that it's really a U-shape

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:14.800
and you can imagine a universe going backwards in time for a while and then turning around and going forwards.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:22.240
Реконсайлинг these pictures of the particles and the universe is something we still have not done

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.760
and it should be fruitful, but I don't quite know how to do it yet.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:34.960
Still working on it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, you have a quick question? Okay, yep.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.040
I was sitting there and I was thinking,

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:46.720
this is very complex and I can understand why you haven't come back from

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:53.520
Britain because you were having too much fun, but I'm thinking that

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:03.680
if we start from the very basics, existence, what is existence?

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:13.040
How did it, how did it appear? I mean, we're sort of going after the second step

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:18.400
of looking at the ball bearings in the world. No, you're absolutely right.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.360
The more basic the question, the harder it is to answer.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.440
So all physics is doing is sort of following our nose and trying to figure out

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:35.040
what might we learn next, but the motivation is exactly what you say.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:43.280
We're trying to understand what the hell is going on in a very big sense.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:48.080
Why is there existence? We don't know. The best we can do is...

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:54.080
That should hint to what all these molecules and everything is about.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.760
It would be called enlightenment.

01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.640
That's a lovely thought to end on, so thank you very much, Neil.
