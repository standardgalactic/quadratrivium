Hello, bonjour, bienvenue, and welcome everyone to Perimeter Institute's public lecture series.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.880
My name is Emily Petroff, and I'm Perimeter's Associate Director for Strategic Partnerships,

00:48.880 --> 00:50.120
Grants and Awards.

00:50.120 --> 00:54.680
I'm delighted to welcome you back to the Mike Lazaridis Theatre of Ideas here at the Perimeter

00:54.680 --> 00:56.680
Institute in Waterloo.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.040
It's a great pleasure to welcome you tonight at the Perimeter Institute for those of you

01:02.040 --> 01:06.240
who are sure we'll have a fascinating presentation.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.720
Perimeter Institute was created to be a gathering place where people can come together like

01:10.720 --> 01:15.080
we're doing tonight to ask the big questions about the universe and search for the big

01:15.080 --> 01:17.040
answers.

01:17.040 --> 01:23.160
Perimeter will soon celebrate 25 years of bringing people together from all paths, researchers,

01:23.160 --> 01:29.560
students, the general public, teachers, to explore the fascinating world of physics.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.080
But people on this land have been asking the big questions about the universe for thousands

01:33.080 --> 01:34.580
of years.

01:34.580 --> 01:39.040
Looking up at the night sky and understanding our place in the cosmos is a human constant

01:39.040 --> 01:40.960
throughout the ages.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.800
We acknowledge that Perimeter Institute is situated on the traditional territory of the

01:44.800 --> 01:50.200
Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, and Neutral Peoples, and is located on the Haldeman Tract, the

01:50.200 --> 01:54.960
tract granted by the British, to the six nations of the Grand River, and the Mississaugas of

01:54.960 --> 01:57.280
the Credit First Nation.

01:57.280 --> 02:03.000
We greet and thank the diverse peoples who preceded us, and we encourage them to act

02:03.000 --> 02:09.440
responsibly and collaboratively to advance the quest of knowledge for the good of all.

02:09.440 --> 02:18.640
We thank the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Neutral Peoples for their support.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.880
For those watching the live webcast, please join the conversation online.

02:22.880 --> 02:27.040
We are at Perimeter on Twitter, or X, and if you have a question for our speaker, you

02:27.040 --> 02:30.600
can ask it with the hashtag PI Live.

02:30.600 --> 02:35.040
This week, Perimeter Institute has been hosting a fascinating workshop called Dark Matter First

02:35.040 --> 02:40.280
Light, which brings together experts to discuss the ways that dark matter impacts the formation

02:40.280 --> 02:43.760
and evolution of stars and galaxies.

02:43.760 --> 02:48.760
This workshop, which concluded today, focused on the new observational programs and techniques

02:48.760 --> 02:54.120
coming online and new modeling tools that may enable a better understanding of the mysterious

02:54.120 --> 02:59.040
matter you'll hear more about tonight.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.840
And now, it is my great pleasure to introduce one of those workshop attendees and our speaker

03:03.840 --> 03:05.680
for tonight.

03:05.680 --> 03:10.040
Theoretical physicist Philip Flip Tenedo is an associate professor at the University

03:10.040 --> 03:14.480
of California, Riverside, and his research seeks to determine the fundamental physics

03:14.480 --> 03:16.240
of dark matter.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.800
He's a 2021 career award winner from the U.S. National Science Foundation and a 2020

03:21.800 --> 03:23.000
Hellman Fellow.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.800
He has appeared in popular media on shows like Nova and Science Friday.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.480
Dr. Tenedo grew up in Los Angeles and is a proud product of the Los Angeles Unified

03:31.480 --> 03:32.880
School District.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.960
He earned his bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics from Stanford University

03:37.200 --> 03:42.480
before completing graduate studies at Cambridge University, Durham University, and Cornell.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.440
He spent three years as a chancellor's advanced postdoctoral fellow at the University of

03:46.440 --> 03:49.760
California, Irvine, before moving to Riverside.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.920
Dr. Tenedo is the first Filipino-American professor of physics and he has served in

03:54.920 --> 03:59.560
several official capacities as an advocate for equity and academia.

03:59.560 --> 04:04.040
His research focuses on developing a fundamental theory of dark matter.

04:04.120 --> 04:08.040
His work has interesting intersections with fields including particle cosmology, machine

04:08.040 --> 04:10.040
learning, and information.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.480
Tonight he will discuss recent developments in the search for dark matter and how the

04:14.480 --> 04:18.120
scientific community can come together to find new answers.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.960
Please join me in welcoming to the stage Professor Flip Tenedo.

04:22.960 --> 04:36.520
Good evening everybody.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.720
My name is Flip.

04:37.720 --> 04:42.800
I am a theoretical physicist and I work on dark matter.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.840
So quick show of hands.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.640
How many people have heard of dark matter?

04:47.640 --> 04:48.640
Good.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.640
Good.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
Good.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
Good.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.920
You know what dark matter is?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.800
One hand up.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.280
So we're all in good company.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.960
We are all in the same tribe.

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
Very good.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.720
We're all in the same boat.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
All right.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.040
So let's get started.

05:07.040 --> 05:12.200
Here is my very best attempt at a completely realistic picture of dark matter.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.920
It's completely invisible.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.920
Okay.

05:14.920 --> 05:18.040
So that's not very interesting.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.160
If you'll permit me a little bit of artistic license.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.080
Here is astronomers up to false color of their photos.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.680
Here is a false color illustration of dark matter.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.360
And I've even done the extra work of sketching where we are.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.120
This is the Milky Way.

05:35.120 --> 05:41.440
And we're sitting in this bubble of dark matter, this big blue bubble of dark matter.

05:41.440 --> 05:47.800
And if we were to zoom out again in this artistic rendition, we would notice that our bubble

05:47.800 --> 05:54.920
of dark matter is actually sitting in a cluster of bubbles of dark matter.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.400
And I didn't draw it here.

05:56.400 --> 06:04.040
But if you looked into each of these bubbles, most of them also happen to have galaxies

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
sitting there.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.280
That's interesting.

06:07.280 --> 06:13.080
And David Foster Wallace had a story once where there were two fish who meet in the

06:13.080 --> 06:14.480
ocean.

06:14.480 --> 06:20.600
And the first fish says, isn't it great that we have water?

06:20.600 --> 06:27.760
And the second fish says, what the hell is water?

06:27.760 --> 06:34.560
And this is where we are as a scientific community thinking about dark matter.

06:34.560 --> 06:40.080
What we know is that we are little fish living in oceans of dark matter.

06:40.080 --> 06:44.360
There are bubbles in a cluster of other bubbles of dark matter.

06:44.360 --> 06:49.600
And there is so much that we do not know, but we know that that much is true.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.200
And this is our cosmic mystery.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.480
So like all mysteries, there's a who, what, when, where, why, and how.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.240
And we won't quite go through them in this order.

07:01.240 --> 07:07.120
This is a piece of art, it's an installation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.280
And in this dark matter business, we have a phrase that we overuse.

07:10.280 --> 07:15.240
And the phrase is looking under lampposts, looking in the dark under lampposts, looking

07:15.240 --> 07:21.720
for truth, finding some angle to learn about this mysterious thing that we're in.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.160
So this is going to be our guidepost.

07:24.160 --> 07:29.280
These are my attempts at lampposts for understanding not just what is the puzzle, but how is it

07:29.280 --> 07:34.680
that me, a theoretical physicist, which you might already think and my colleagues do think,

07:34.680 --> 07:41.480
what can you possibly do if you don't have a lab, am tasked with understanding a substance

07:41.480 --> 07:45.880
that surrounds us that we can either see, nor touch, nor smell, nor taste, nor anything

07:45.880 --> 07:51.880
else to the best of our knowledge and then somehow do science on this.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.800
It's a bit of a tall order, isn't it?

07:54.800 --> 07:59.320
So let's start with what.

07:59.320 --> 08:06.360
And in fact, what I need from you today is to start with the assumption that dark matter

08:06.360 --> 08:12.520
exists and there's one thing that we know pretty well, which is roughly how much there

08:12.520 --> 08:14.200
is, right?

08:14.200 --> 08:18.480
Of all this matter, all the stuff in the universe, all the things you would call chunky matter

08:18.480 --> 08:27.080
like things, we're dark, we are about 15% and most of the rest of it is dark matter.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.080
Are we okay with that?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.480
We're all on board?

08:31.480 --> 08:33.520
Anybody skeptical?

08:33.520 --> 08:37.960
Any physics students in the room, any science students in the room, very good.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.560
And I will speak for you.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.560
You are all feeling very uncomfortable right now.

08:42.560 --> 08:46.400
You do not like someone sitting here telling you there's this invisible thing that surrounds

08:46.400 --> 08:49.880
the universe and it's real, I just need you to believe me.

08:49.880 --> 08:54.640
All right, so let's not just take this completely on faith.

08:54.640 --> 08:59.040
There is evidence for the existence of something more, something that we do not understand.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.600
For these bubbles of dark matter that we live in.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.880
And the evidence comes from the sky.

09:03.880 --> 09:11.040
When we look at the motion of stars in galaxies, when we look at motions of clusters of galaxies

09:11.040 --> 09:15.960
that happen to be pancaking towards each other in the distant sky.

09:15.960 --> 09:20.960
And when we look at the photons from the cosmic microwave backgrounds, the very first photons

09:20.960 --> 09:27.920
from 13 billion years ago reaching our telescopes today, each of these probes give indelible

09:27.920 --> 09:35.400
evidence that there is stuff that is clumped up that cannot be explained by protons, neutrons

09:35.400 --> 09:40.960
and electrons and their cousins.

09:40.960 --> 09:41.960
Everybody convinced now?

09:41.960 --> 09:44.720
Are we all on board?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.160
Physics students are all on board?

09:47.160 --> 09:54.560
Okay, so one of the organizers for the conference that I've just come from is Katie Mack who

09:54.560 --> 09:56.040
is sitting here in the audience.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.920
She's a faculty member here at PI.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.760
You've heard of her?

10:01.760 --> 10:06.640
And I had the special joy of attending one of Katie's colloquia at the Aspen Center

10:06.640 --> 10:08.600
for Physics a few years ago.

10:08.600 --> 10:13.320
And Katie gave us a fantastic talk which I am summarizing in this board which you cannot

10:13.320 --> 10:16.360
read deliberately so because I don't want to give that talk.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.080
I am not qualified to give that talk.

10:18.080 --> 10:24.480
But here are 12 pieces of evidence that Katie has organized for why we are so sure that

10:24.480 --> 10:27.320
dark matter exists.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.680
Now you might be able to read the titles.

10:30.680 --> 10:34.640
What is important here is that there are many reasons.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.840
What is important here is that they're complementary.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.600
And so it's not just that you see a few stars.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.840
It's not just you see a galaxy cluster.

10:41.840 --> 10:46.320
It's not just that you observe this cosmic microwave background.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.120
That's like saying if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's probably a duck

10:50.120 --> 10:52.200
and therefore dark matter.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.480
But all of these different pieces of evidence are telling you.

10:56.480 --> 11:02.560
Taking at different length scales, at different times in the cosmic history, it's not only

11:02.560 --> 11:06.160
that it walks like a duck, it talks like a duck.

11:06.160 --> 11:13.520
It's got feathers, a beak, it has duck DNA, and it tastes great with hoisin sauce.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.960
So that doesn't mean that it is definitely dark matter.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.440
Like this guy on stage is saying it's dark matter.

11:18.440 --> 11:25.760
But what that does mean is if it is not dark matter, something really strange is going

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
on.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.400
The most conservative thing we can say is that all of these different pieces of evidence

11:31.400 --> 11:36.400
are pointing to something that looks like stuff matter.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.040
That is not the stuff that we are used to.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.280
So that's where we are.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.640
It would be amazing if it weren't dark matter.

11:43.640 --> 11:47.320
Something way more exciting is happening.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.960
So the other thing that you might notice, all of this evidence is coming from the sky.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.920
Astronomy and cosmology.

11:53.920 --> 12:00.480
There is no problem with inferring that dark matter exists from astronomy and cosmology.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.440
I am a theoretical particle physicist.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.440
The problem is in my tribe.

12:06.440 --> 12:12.120
The problem is what is this dark matter?

12:12.120 --> 12:18.440
So let me jump to a very different type of question.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.120
When is dark matter?

12:22.120 --> 12:25.760
Why is it that we are studying dark matter now?

12:25.760 --> 12:28.280
And this is where the apology of my talk comes in.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.120
So let me give you a very biased, it's almost true.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.840
Anybody here who is a specialist will know this is not quite true, but this is morally

12:34.840 --> 12:37.760
true of history of dark matter.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.240
And this is a history of two tribes.

12:40.360 --> 12:46.320
So physics, where the problem is, and astronomy, where the observations are.

12:46.320 --> 12:55.320
And this goes all the way back at least until Orton's wiki, who observed in the early telescopes

12:55.320 --> 13:03.920
that the motion of galaxy clusters didn't quite match what they expected from the calculations

13:03.920 --> 13:04.920
that they made.

13:05.600 --> 13:12.160
And they said, hey, you know what, this data really looks consistent with missing matter

13:12.160 --> 13:16.800
that is not the ordinary stars that we expect to see.

13:16.800 --> 13:22.120
Now I wasn't around at the time, but I imagine what happened between the 1930s and the 1970s.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.280
People said, well, that's kind of interesting, this is a brand new telescope, telescopes

13:25.280 --> 13:31.600
are hard, we don't really understand these instruments, so who knows what's going on.

13:31.600 --> 13:37.760
And in the 1970s, Vera Rubin also came to the same conclusion, looking at a completely

13:37.760 --> 13:42.680
different scale, looking at spiral galaxies, like the spiral galaxy, the Milky Way that

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
we are in right now.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.600
So this is a completely different system, right, as Vicki was looking at clusters of

13:47.600 --> 13:53.040
galaxies, Rubin was looking at spiral galaxies, and the motion of stars within the spiral

13:53.040 --> 14:00.400
galaxy also seemed to imply, oh, wait a second, there appears to be missing stuff.

14:00.400 --> 14:09.640
Okay, now I imagine in the 1970s, if you were a particle physicist, a fundamental physicist,

14:09.640 --> 14:13.360
whatever that means, and you just happened to be sitting there in your office, sitting

14:13.360 --> 14:18.760
on your thumbs, not knowing what was going on, you had nothing better to do in your life,

14:18.760 --> 14:24.000
nothing, you would have dropped everything and thought about this problem.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.360
This would be the problem to solve.

14:28.360 --> 14:33.640
It just so happens that in this other tribe, and usually the astronomy and the physics

14:33.640 --> 14:37.160
floors, there are different floors in the building, so it really feels like a different

14:37.160 --> 14:42.280
tribe, in this other tribe, something else was going on.

14:42.280 --> 14:48.720
Around this period of time, particle physics, which was a new field, were building new toys,

14:48.720 --> 14:55.880
these colliders where they're smashing together protons and elements, and producing all sorts

14:55.880 --> 14:59.960
of new and unexpected particles.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.880
And it was a puzzle, why are we getting all of these particles, where are they coming,

15:02.880 --> 15:05.440
are they inside the atom, what does that mean?

15:05.440 --> 15:10.960
And I will arbitrarily pick a period of 1970, so my higher mark will be the Nobel Prize

15:10.960 --> 15:15.640
for what's called the electroweak theory.

15:15.640 --> 15:20.480
There is a tremendous effort leading up to this and after this, but this is a benchmark

15:20.480 --> 15:26.800
for me for the development theoretically of what we now know as the standard model of

15:26.800 --> 15:29.120
particle physics.

15:29.120 --> 15:34.960
And it was a heroic effort between experimental and theoretical physics to build this mathematical

15:34.960 --> 15:37.520
edifice.

15:37.520 --> 15:43.320
And there was one puzzle, which had obsessed the community, rightfully so, and that puzzle

15:43.320 --> 15:48.880
had to do with the reason why we built the Large Hadron Collider and that thing is called

15:48.880 --> 15:50.280
the Higgs Boson.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.680
So how many people here have heard of the Higgs Boson?

15:53.680 --> 16:00.320
I suspect it as much, I'm a crowd that comes to the perimeter institute in the snow outside.

16:00.320 --> 16:08.160
So the story then, the apology then, is if we have known about missing matter for almost

16:08.160 --> 16:15.440
a hundred years, why is it that we're talking about dark matter and the theoretical progress

16:15.440 --> 16:21.920
in dark matter in the 2020s with fresh new oz?

16:21.920 --> 16:26.000
So let me take you, let me continue this biased history.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.280
Let's go back to my tribe, particle physics.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.640
This edifice that we built up, the standard model, if you ask me, the standard model looks

16:33.640 --> 16:36.680
like this.

16:36.680 --> 16:41.400
And if you wanted to be fancy and if you visited CERN, you can buy a mug like this, which is

16:41.400 --> 16:47.560
roughly the mathematics behind this ugly thing.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.840
This ugly thing is a table.

16:49.840 --> 16:55.600
And it's a bit strange, but we've seen tables before.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.960
Some of us have taken chemistry.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.480
Those of us who did poorly in chemistry went on to do physics.

17:01.480 --> 17:06.040
But in chemistry, you have the periodic table, right?

17:06.040 --> 17:10.200
Anybody hear a chemist before I say a few chemists?

17:10.200 --> 17:17.040
Now the periodic table, I'm going to guess not even chemists say, I love the periodic

17:17.040 --> 17:18.040
table.

17:18.040 --> 17:22.960
The periodic table is so great because I can look up any atomic number and learn the math

17:22.960 --> 17:24.800
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

17:24.800 --> 17:29.120
I think that's a fair statement.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.720
But the periodic table is fantastic.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.080
And it's not fantastic because of the data that is inside it.

17:35.080 --> 17:40.440
It is fantastic because the table is an organizing principle.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.640
If you have a box on the table, you know there's an atomic number, there's some number of protons,

17:44.640 --> 17:47.960
some number of neutrons, da, da, da, da.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.960
You know if there's something missing.

17:50.960 --> 17:58.920
And this is a mathematical picture of what we call the standard model of particle physics.

17:58.920 --> 18:05.000
The periodic table is beautiful because as physicists we understand that the periodic

18:05.000 --> 18:10.760
table reflects a deep mathematical organizing principle and that is quantum mechanics applied

18:10.760 --> 18:12.560
to atoms.

18:12.560 --> 18:17.640
So this is what third and fourth year physics students do in the quantum mechanics courses.

18:17.640 --> 18:23.560
And this thing, this mess of a table is beautiful not because they're these weird funny symbols

18:23.560 --> 18:31.000
and they look kind of alien, but because this also reflects an organizing principle.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.480
And this organizing principle lives within a generalization of quantum mechanics called

18:34.480 --> 18:37.520
quantum field theory.

18:37.520 --> 18:42.480
And what this table is, each row is a class of particle or a quantum field if you want

18:42.480 --> 18:44.880
to be fancy.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.040
These are their funny names.

18:47.040 --> 18:51.380
Each row, one half means these are matter particles.

18:51.380 --> 18:56.060
If it's not one half, it's a force particle, we'll get to the H in a bit.

18:56.060 --> 19:00.460
And each of these columns is one of the three fundamental forces of particle physics, so

19:00.460 --> 19:02.420
gravity is not included here.

19:02.420 --> 19:08.220
And each of these funny symbols is a mathematical description of how those particles interact

19:08.220 --> 19:11.540
under these fundamental forces.

19:11.540 --> 19:15.300
So if you have new particles, the new particles should have something called spin which tells

19:15.300 --> 19:21.020
if it's matter or a force particle and some numbers over here or some symbols over here.

19:21.020 --> 19:27.020
And the one thing that was missing from the standard model of the 1970s was something

19:27.020 --> 19:29.460
related to the Higgs boson.

19:29.460 --> 19:34.580
It was this question that if we didn't have this last row, something funny happened to

19:34.580 --> 19:41.820
our equations when we calculated the likelihood for two particles to smash together.

19:41.820 --> 19:47.100
And the mathematics were giving us weird numbers like infinity, if that's even a number, any

19:47.100 --> 19:51.500
mathematicians.

19:51.500 --> 19:56.180
And the simplest explanation for why this theory would make sense is that there is one

19:56.180 --> 20:02.460
more line here, the Higgs boson, that had particular properties and if you turn the

20:02.460 --> 20:07.580
crank, everything made sense.

20:07.580 --> 20:09.180
Everything except for one thing.

20:09.180 --> 20:12.340
So we had a great idea of finding the Higgs boson.

20:12.340 --> 20:17.620
If the Higgs boson actually exists, most of you know the answer, if the Higgs boson

20:17.620 --> 20:21.940
actually exists, there was one additional puzzle.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.260
Why is it so light?

20:23.260 --> 20:29.940
We now know that the Higgs boson weighs about 125 times the mass of a proton.

20:29.940 --> 20:34.180
If you turn the crank in this theory, you would expect it to be much heavier.

20:34.180 --> 20:37.540
So this is give and take that didn't quite make sense.

20:37.540 --> 20:43.500
And so if you zoom back to the 1990s and you went to the particle physics floor, not

20:43.500 --> 20:47.940
the astronomy floor, they had two choices.

20:47.940 --> 20:52.620
One choice was this puzzle of why is the Higgs boson light?

20:52.620 --> 20:58.940
This was a puzzle that their community had built up to over 40 years of colliding particles

20:58.940 --> 21:02.660
and building mathematical models, learning what all these weird symbols and tables meant,

21:02.660 --> 21:06.580
and oh yeah, this is an open question.

21:06.580 --> 21:12.420
And then there was this puzzle that our friends downstairs, our friends with these funny telescopes

21:12.420 --> 21:16.260
and they go out at night, they're kind of like vampires, and they kept telling us this

21:16.260 --> 21:23.860
weird thing about this missing matter, okay, which one are you going to work on?

21:23.860 --> 21:27.620
The one where there were faculty who will hire you as a postdoc.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.820
So this was the most important question.

21:30.820 --> 21:37.060
And now I'm going to lead us down to the story of an opinionated, mostly correct story of

21:37.060 --> 21:41.540
the weakly interacting massive particle, the wimp.

21:41.540 --> 21:46.260
And this dominated our idea of what dark matter ought to be, and as a scientist you'd be really

21:46.260 --> 21:52.740
careful when you say nature ought to be something for about 30 years.

21:52.740 --> 21:56.300
And here's how it works.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.660
So you have this big problem, this big deep problem.

21:59.660 --> 22:01.140
Why is the Higgs boson light?

22:01.140 --> 22:04.100
You do the calculations, it doesn't seem to make sense.

22:04.100 --> 22:10.260
But you realize that there's a way to explain why the Higgs boson would be light, and that's

22:10.260 --> 22:16.860
to invoke some deep, elegant mathematical principle that would explain why the theory is actually

22:16.860 --> 22:20.620
more constrained.

22:20.620 --> 22:27.180
Here is one such deep, elegant mathematical principle, it's called supersymmetry.

22:27.180 --> 22:32.940
Symmetry is some deep, elegant mathematical relation between force particles and matter

22:32.940 --> 22:33.940
particles.

22:33.940 --> 22:34.940
And they all have silly names.

22:34.940 --> 22:40.740
If an electron is a matter particle, there's a silly force particle, they say electron.

22:40.740 --> 22:43.220
You have to get your kick somewhere.

22:43.220 --> 22:44.620
So what?

22:44.620 --> 22:53.260
So this ends up solving this puzzle that we had found.

22:53.260 --> 22:57.060
Symmetry, because every particle has a copy, gives you new particles.

22:57.060 --> 23:00.220
This theory predicts new particles.

23:00.220 --> 23:05.660
So lesson number one, moe particles, moe problems.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.460
I want this all to be on board with that.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.460
So what happened?

23:09.460 --> 23:12.820
Oh, this theory has more particles.

23:12.820 --> 23:14.140
So what?

23:14.140 --> 23:18.100
It turns out, the moment you put these new particles in, and you knew exactly what they

23:18.100 --> 23:26.660
were, because for every proton, there's a super proton, all this stuff, protons suddenly

23:26.660 --> 23:30.300
have new reactions where they can decay.

23:30.300 --> 23:35.700
Well, that seems kind of dangerous.

23:35.700 --> 23:39.780
You're here, I'm here, our protons are still around.

23:39.780 --> 23:43.580
And in fact, for the physics students in the room, the bound on the lifetime of the proton

23:43.580 --> 23:47.180
is actually longer than the age of the universe.

23:47.180 --> 23:50.860
So you should think about, how do we have a bound that is longer than the age of space

23:50.860 --> 23:53.100
time itself?

23:53.100 --> 23:58.940
But protons are pretty darn stable, so that's not a good feature.

23:58.940 --> 24:04.540
But we're thinking, you know, this is some weird practical problem, and this is this elegant,

24:04.540 --> 24:09.900
deep mathematical thing was so beautiful, let's try to save it.

24:09.900 --> 24:16.940
And what we do is we put a bandaid, a mathematical bandaid, and we invent some additional symmetry.

24:17.060 --> 24:23.060
It's not deep, not elegant, but we just say, maybe there's some rule that prohibits these

24:23.060 --> 24:26.700
interactions, and it has this silly name, r-parity.

24:26.700 --> 24:31.460
And I will bet you nobody in this entire institute knows what the r means in r-parity.

24:31.460 --> 24:34.700
I don't know.

24:34.700 --> 24:40.180
But what this r-parity does, mathematically, you apply r-parity, and that means that the

24:40.180 --> 24:46.420
interactions that would have caused the protons to decay are no longer allowed.

24:46.420 --> 24:49.180
And it looks like everything starts to work again.

24:49.180 --> 24:54.220
You solve your deep elegant problem, and the immediate other problem that comes up seems

24:54.220 --> 24:57.780
to be okay, and you start feeling pretty good.

24:57.780 --> 25:01.220
You bring your team of graduate students, and you look at this, and you say, hey, what

25:01.220 --> 25:03.420
else does this theory do for us?

25:03.420 --> 25:12.460
Well, with all of these new particles, and some reason, some parity, it turns out the

25:12.460 --> 25:16.620
lightest new particle is stable.

25:16.620 --> 25:22.540
So the reason why electrons don't decay into neutrinos, which are these other funny particles,

25:22.540 --> 25:25.980
is because electrons are the lightest particle that carry electric charge.

25:25.980 --> 25:30.540
There's no way to conserve charge if that electron decayed.

25:30.540 --> 25:39.140
So the lightest new particle which carries r-charge is stable, cosmologically stable.

25:39.140 --> 25:44.380
And it is at this point that we think, hey, you know, I heard something about cosmologically

25:44.380 --> 25:45.700
stable new particles.

25:45.700 --> 25:50.260
Oh, it was our friends downstairs, as we go down the stairs, and they say, what do you

25:50.260 --> 25:52.220
know about dark matter?

25:52.220 --> 25:57.540
And the one thing that we knew about dark matter is roughly how much there is.

25:57.540 --> 26:00.620
So there's a calculation to be done, and it's a good thing, because there's a grad

26:00.620 --> 26:04.100
student now in the room who says, hey, you know what you should do?

26:04.100 --> 26:06.940
Do this calculation.

26:06.940 --> 26:12.100
And let's be very honest, the first thing the grad student does is, nah, that calculation

26:12.100 --> 26:13.100
is hard.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.900
And it is hard.

26:14.900 --> 26:21.100
It's hard because this calculation is telling you how much dark matter is left over after

26:21.100 --> 26:22.780
the Big Bang.

26:22.780 --> 26:27.060
So on the one side of the calculation, you're doing this particle physics calculation, something

26:27.060 --> 26:32.780
about quantum mechanics and reaction rates for producing dark matter and dark matter annihilating.

26:32.820 --> 26:39.180
On the other side of this calculation is something about the expansion of the universe to figure

26:39.180 --> 26:41.260
out how much dark matter is left over.

26:41.260 --> 26:45.420
So you have gravity, you know, G-Newton is in there, and on the other side, you have

26:45.420 --> 26:49.740
all these particle physics numbers, and the grad student says, you're telling me that

26:49.740 --> 26:53.580
you want me to do this really hard calculation.

26:53.580 --> 26:57.900
Learn all this general relativity, and you expect me to match this arbitrary number from

26:57.900 --> 27:01.420
these people downstairs who I've never met in my entire three years as a grad student.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.940
And you say, yeah, it's for your thesis.

27:05.940 --> 27:13.140
And wouldn't you know, wouldn't you know that the number that comes out is the correct number?

27:15.860 --> 27:17.540
No, OK, that's a lie.

27:17.540 --> 27:20.580
But it was a correct number within a couple of orders of magnitude.

27:23.780 --> 27:27.660
I need astronomers, at least one astronomer in the front row.

27:27.660 --> 27:31.740
But if you're a particle physicist sitting on the fifth floor and the astronomer's on

27:31.740 --> 27:36.060
the fourth floor, you think, two orders of magnitude, that's amazing for astronomy.

27:36.060 --> 27:37.900
You're dead on.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.660
So we write papers and we celebrate.

27:40.660 --> 27:44.100
OK, you wake up the next morning feeling pretty good about yourself.

27:47.260 --> 27:49.820
And then someone knocks on your door.

27:49.820 --> 27:50.900
Who's here at 9 a.m.?

27:50.900 --> 27:52.020
You open up the door.

27:52.020 --> 27:57.540
Professor, that was a fantastic series of paper you wrote about super symmetry and

27:57.540 --> 27:58.980
dark matter.

27:58.980 --> 28:00.580
I'm your new grad student.

28:00.580 --> 28:02.660
What are we going to work on now?

28:02.660 --> 28:07.380
And you think, oh, gosh, I don't remember that I hired a grad student.

28:07.380 --> 28:11.660
Well, there is one game that I know how to play.

28:11.660 --> 28:14.660
And it's this puzzle of why is the Higgs light?

28:14.660 --> 28:16.020
Oh, maybe we got it wrong last time.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.860
OK, let's try alternatives.

28:18.860 --> 28:24.500
Let's look for some other deep, elegant, mathematical explanation for why the Higgs

28:24.500 --> 28:25.500
mass should be light.

28:25.540 --> 28:30.900
And it turns out one such deep, elegant, mathematical solution is to extend space

28:30.900 --> 28:33.580
time, have an extra dimension.

28:33.580 --> 28:36.100
Totally weird.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.180
Turns out it can kind of work.

28:38.180 --> 28:41.220
Well, if you have an extra dimension, what do you get?

28:41.220 --> 28:46.180
Like higher modes in the violin string, like higher octaves, these extra dimensions

28:46.180 --> 28:49.620
predict new particles.

28:49.620 --> 28:50.620
Huh, OK.

28:50.620 --> 28:53.420
And what happens when you have new particles?

28:53.460 --> 28:56.860
Mo particles, mo problems.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.940
Turns out these new particles, when you put them into your theory, screw up all sorts

29:00.940 --> 29:06.060
of weird observations that we found over the past 30 years.

29:06.060 --> 29:06.820
So that can't be right.

29:06.820 --> 29:09.980
It's not quite proton decay, but related to proton decay.

29:09.980 --> 29:13.540
And there are weird different flavors of extra dimensions.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.620
And so the grad student starts to slump.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.260
We say, it's OK.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.900
We've done this before.

29:19.900 --> 29:23.220
So you invent a humbler new symmetry.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.460
It's a band-aid, mathematical band-aid.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.740
It's called collusive client parity.

29:27.740 --> 29:32.380
What that means is some of these new particles are prohibited from interacting

29:32.380 --> 29:38.260
in certain ways, and it ends up curing these observables, just like preventing

29:38.260 --> 29:40.860
the proton from decaying.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.420
And the grad student says, oh, good.

29:42.420 --> 29:43.620
What else happens?

29:43.620 --> 29:47.980
Well, once you have a new symmetry and some conserved charge, the lightest new

29:47.980 --> 29:51.620
particle is stable, cosmologically stable.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.420
And the grad student says, OK.

29:54.420 --> 30:00.980
And then, well, what I would like you to do is to read your predecessor's thesis

30:00.980 --> 30:05.980
and learn how to do the calculation where this new light particle, this lightest

30:05.980 --> 30:13.460
particle with KK charge, how much of it is left over in the universe?

30:13.460 --> 30:17.340
And the grad student says, OK, well, I can read the previous student's thesis,

30:17.340 --> 30:20.380
but that was like a shot in the dark that it worked out.

30:20.380 --> 30:21.100
How do you expect?

30:21.100 --> 30:22.780
And you said, just do it.

30:24.220 --> 30:28.860
And while the grad student is going through this calculation, you look at this chart

30:28.860 --> 30:34.300
and you realize the new particles that you get, you know a lot about these new

30:34.300 --> 30:35.060
particles.

30:35.060 --> 30:40.700
You know a lot about them because they inherit their properties from the Higgs

30:40.700 --> 30:42.180
and all of the Higgs' cousins.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.300
Why?

30:43.300 --> 30:46.020
Because there is this deep, elegant mathematical symmetry.

30:46.020 --> 30:46.900
It's like a mirror.

30:46.900 --> 30:51.540
The thing on the other side of the mirror, you know what that person looks like.

30:51.540 --> 30:55.900
And so when the grad student comes back and says, would you believe?

30:55.900 --> 30:58.540
You'd say, yeah, it probably works out, doesn't it?

30:58.540 --> 31:00.700
And you're starting to realize it's not a coincidence.

31:00.700 --> 31:05.940
The details of the calculation change, but the numbers that go in are all basically

31:05.940 --> 31:08.700
the same scale numbers.

31:08.700 --> 31:15.100
The grad student goes off to celebrate and you buy a bottle of champagne for their dissertation.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.980
Next morning.

31:16.980 --> 31:21.420
Professor, oh my gosh, I love the series of papers that you're doing.

31:21.460 --> 31:22.780
What's my first project?

31:22.780 --> 31:24.020
I'm your brand new grad student.

31:24.020 --> 31:28.300
And you think, holy moly, this large electron collider has better turn on soon

31:28.300 --> 31:30.140
because I am running dry.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.580
But you think, well, why is the Higgs light?

31:32.580 --> 31:33.700
Let's think of a new ring.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.740
Maybe there's substructure.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.500
Maybe the Higgs is not a fundamental particle, but there are some, you know,

31:39.500 --> 31:42.980
sub protons and sub neutrons that come together to form the Higgs.

31:42.980 --> 31:43.340
Oh, OK.

31:43.340 --> 31:44.660
So what does that mean?

31:44.660 --> 31:48.300
Well, if you have like sub protons and sub neutrons and you have some other particles.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.620
Great.

31:49.620 --> 31:50.260
Is that OK?

31:50.260 --> 31:53.700
No, probably not because you have all these observables that we have seen.

31:53.700 --> 31:56.180
And these new particles screw it all up.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.100
Oh, should I be said?

31:57.100 --> 31:58.860
It's OK.

31:58.860 --> 32:00.580
We can apply a bandaid.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.180
This one's called T-parity.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.380
I'm pretty sure.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.980
Actually, people at Perimeter might know what T means.

32:05.980 --> 32:08.500
And I should ask.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.420
What does it do?

32:09.420 --> 32:11.260
Well, it solves this problem.

32:11.260 --> 32:15.220
And it means that the lightest new particle is cosmologically stable.

32:15.220 --> 32:18.500
And then you tell the grad student, go and do the calculation.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.900
I'm pretty sure it's going to work out.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.300
It almost has to.

32:22.300 --> 32:26.140
The details of this calculation, even though it's on the one side,

32:26.140 --> 32:27.220
it's all particle physics.

32:27.220 --> 32:30.140
On the other side, it's all general relativity.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.980
The fact that they're all the same essential properties,

32:33.980 --> 32:36.940
the same essential mass scales, the same essential fundamental

32:36.940 --> 32:40.260
couplings, even though the details change,

32:40.260 --> 32:42.380
if they're within a couple of orders of magnitude,

32:42.380 --> 32:44.700
it's going to land in that window.

32:44.700 --> 32:47.380
And it does.

32:47.420 --> 32:52.940
And as a discipline, you are feeling pretty darn good.

32:52.940 --> 32:56.580
Not only was there this puzzle where you needed a Higgs boson.

32:56.580 --> 32:58.140
OK, we predict the Higgs boson.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.660
But then you anticipated another problem.

33:01.660 --> 33:04.620
And you came up with this deep, elegant mathematical solution,

33:04.620 --> 33:06.740
not just one, but three.

33:06.740 --> 33:07.660
It's got to be one of them.

33:07.660 --> 33:10.700
And each one of those predicts new particles that

33:10.700 --> 33:13.700
solves the downstairs people's problems.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.340
Not only are we doing great in our field,

33:15.340 --> 33:16.700
we're solving astronomy's problems.

33:16.700 --> 33:19.220
Good for us.

33:19.220 --> 33:21.140
Oh, boy.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.820
It's a no-lose scenario.

33:22.820 --> 33:26.100
You tell your colleagues, we have to build a collider.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.540
We have to look for the Higgs.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.300
And then we will learn truth.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.180
There's something to see.

33:31.180 --> 33:33.420
If you didn't find the Higgs, that's even better.

33:33.420 --> 33:36.100
It's a bigger mystery.

33:36.100 --> 33:41.060
So circa 1990s, this is what the standard model of particle

33:41.060 --> 33:44.540
physics looked like to a theoretical particle

33:44.540 --> 33:47.140
physicist.

33:47.140 --> 33:49.180
And this is what experimental particle

33:49.180 --> 33:52.460
physicists looked like to a theoretical particle

33:52.460 --> 33:55.780
physicist, which, of course, I'm joking.

33:55.780 --> 33:58.100
This is how progress happens.

33:58.100 --> 34:02.100
And the key point is, when you have this no-lose theorem,

34:02.100 --> 34:04.140
that there is a deep, meaningful reason

34:04.140 --> 34:06.260
to build this collider, because whatever comes out,

34:06.260 --> 34:07.820
you will learn truth.

34:07.820 --> 34:13.220
You very quickly go from this to this.

34:13.220 --> 34:16.140
And then even faster than it took to build this,

34:16.140 --> 34:20.620
you go from this to this.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.820
So how many people here remember the Nobel Prize

34:23.820 --> 34:26.820
for the Higgs boson, 2013?

34:26.820 --> 34:27.700
Very good.

34:27.700 --> 34:30.900
And then remember the Nobel Prize for the discovery

34:30.900 --> 34:31.860
of supersymmetry.

34:34.860 --> 34:35.860
That's right.

34:35.860 --> 34:40.620
The Nobel Prize for the discovery of extra dimensions

34:40.620 --> 34:44.740
of the compositeness of the no.

34:44.740 --> 34:47.820
So something went tremendously right.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.900
There was a Higgs boson.

34:49.900 --> 34:53.420
But something went tremendously wrong.

34:53.420 --> 34:57.300
So 2013 also happened to be the year

34:57.300 --> 34:59.900
that I defended my thesis.

34:59.900 --> 35:03.460
It was a thesis you probably have heard of the chapters.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.620
Chapter one was supersymmetry.

35:05.620 --> 35:07.620
Chapter two was extra dimensions.

35:07.620 --> 35:10.700
And chapter three was the compositeness of the Higgs.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.740
And all of the great new things we

35:12.740 --> 35:15.180
would discover at the Large Hadron Collider.

35:18.300 --> 35:20.980
I don't know how it happened, but by some happenstance,

35:20.980 --> 35:24.900
someone put me in contact with science news.

35:24.900 --> 35:28.700
And the next thing I knew, I was literally the poster child

35:28.700 --> 35:35.300
for a particular type of ennui among particle theory

35:35.300 --> 35:39.540
graduate students who are graduating right around this time.

35:39.540 --> 35:40.940
And it was so great.

35:40.940 --> 35:43.460
It was a perfect love story.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.540
You solve this problem in particle physics,

35:45.540 --> 35:50.980
and for free, you predict the solution to this other problem.

35:50.980 --> 35:55.100
And what this meant was that maybe the love story

35:55.100 --> 35:57.140
has a breakup.

35:57.140 --> 36:03.260
And like your first love, when it ends,

36:03.260 --> 36:05.820
you get a little bit gothy.

36:05.820 --> 36:07.140
And that's when I said, you know what?

36:07.140 --> 36:09.300
I'm done with the Higgs boson.

36:09.300 --> 36:13.220
I am now a dark matter theorist.

36:13.220 --> 36:14.580
And there was some reason to this.

36:14.580 --> 36:17.180
There's this idea that there is still an open problem

36:17.180 --> 36:19.860
and a toolkit for building theories that

36:19.860 --> 36:25.780
had not been fully utilized directly for this problem.

36:25.780 --> 36:28.100
How do people feel right now?

36:28.100 --> 36:30.220
I know my own emotional feelings about this.

36:30.220 --> 36:31.660
It takes some time to get over it.

36:31.660 --> 36:35.100
But it's a little bit of a downer.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.460
So let's move on to where.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.860
And here is where there's a little bit of hope.

36:38.860 --> 36:41.380
Because even though this fantastic program of the weakly

36:41.380 --> 36:43.300
interacting massive particle, the supersymmetry

36:43.300 --> 36:45.220
actually dimensions, composite Higgs,

36:45.220 --> 36:47.540
even though all of that didn't quite pan out

36:47.540 --> 36:51.740
as well as we had hoped, it worked great for Higgs,

36:51.740 --> 36:56.300
we still have the large hadron collider, which

36:56.300 --> 36:59.300
probes smaller length scales than ever before probable

36:59.300 --> 37:01.060
by the human race.

37:01.100 --> 37:06.780
This is humanity's best microscope ever built.

37:06.780 --> 37:12.140
We still have labs like Snow Lab, about 400 kilometers

37:12.140 --> 37:15.980
north of here, where we have the most pristine environments

37:15.980 --> 37:18.940
to look for the chance interactions of dark matter

37:18.940 --> 37:22.820
scattering off of a nucleus, some of the most pristine

37:22.820 --> 37:27.780
environments, again, literally ever made by humanity.

37:27.780 --> 37:32.620
We still have an upcoming program of telescopes

37:32.620 --> 37:36.780
to search with higher and higher resolution for this light

37:36.780 --> 37:39.100
from 13 billion years ago.

37:39.100 --> 37:43.140
And this is a site in Chile in the Atacama Desert.

37:43.140 --> 37:46.260
And completely unexpected, we now

37:46.260 --> 37:50.700
have gravitational waves, which are literally

37:50.700 --> 37:53.700
a brand new way and qualitatively different way

37:53.700 --> 37:57.660
of seeing the universe through radiation of space

37:57.660 --> 37:58.660
and time itself.

38:02.260 --> 38:05.780
We are equipped to make progress on this problem.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.620
And so for all that I will apologize,

38:07.620 --> 38:10.580
and you know what, maybe the 1990s and 2000s,

38:10.580 --> 38:13.420
we were thinking in the wrong direction.

38:13.420 --> 38:16.900
This program, some of its serendipitous,

38:16.900 --> 38:19.340
is well suited where we have a fighting chance

38:19.340 --> 38:22.980
to make deep progress on this question.

38:22.980 --> 38:25.740
So for the past two years, the North American particle

38:25.740 --> 38:28.380
physics community goes through this decadal process

38:28.380 --> 38:30.340
where we review one of our priorities,

38:30.340 --> 38:32.060
our scientific priorities, in our field

38:32.060 --> 38:33.420
of fundamental physics.

38:33.420 --> 38:35.500
And it should not surprise you that one

38:35.500 --> 38:37.900
of the unifying themes was to understand,

38:37.900 --> 38:41.580
what is dark matter?

38:41.580 --> 38:44.060
All right.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.740
So that says something about particle physics.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.700
That says something about where the field is.

38:48.700 --> 38:52.140
I am a theoretical particle physicist.

38:52.140 --> 38:56.340
How is it that I search for dark matter?

38:56.340 --> 38:59.020
All right, so I have a quiz.

38:59.020 --> 39:01.700
This depends on whether or not you're wearing glasses.

39:01.700 --> 39:05.180
What is the difference between these two pictures?

39:05.180 --> 39:07.340
Anybody?

39:07.340 --> 39:07.940
Good.

39:07.940 --> 39:11.420
So one of these is the Millennium Falcon.

39:11.420 --> 39:14.140
I think this is a screenshot from one of the movies.

39:14.140 --> 39:16.900
Let me say this is the Millennium Falcon.

39:16.900 --> 39:21.780
The other is a Lego model of the Millennium Falcon.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.100
And there's something very deep here

39:23.100 --> 39:27.140
that I think rings true to any physicist.

39:27.140 --> 39:30.820
The model is an approximation for the actual thing.

39:34.660 --> 39:36.580
If you zoom into the model, if you lift it up,

39:36.580 --> 39:37.900
if you look around, if you pick it up,

39:37.900 --> 39:40.340
you say, hey, this thing is kind of small to be the Millennium

39:40.340 --> 39:42.300
Falcon.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.420
But in the right context, you learn something

39:45.420 --> 39:46.420
about the Millennium Falcon.

39:46.420 --> 39:50.580
You learn, oh, maybe this little deflector dish, which

39:50.580 --> 39:51.740
fell off in one of the movies.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.580
It's roughly the same size as this bit over here.

39:53.580 --> 39:57.700
There are things you can learn from a model.

39:57.700 --> 39:59.820
But the model is not nature.

39:59.820 --> 40:01.940
The fact that you have a mathematical model

40:01.940 --> 40:06.060
does not prescribe what ought to happen in nature.

40:06.060 --> 40:07.140
And this is where we are.

40:07.140 --> 40:09.740
So when you ask, what is it that theoretical physicists do?

40:09.740 --> 40:12.780
There's a misconception that we tell you what nature is.

40:12.780 --> 40:13.500
We don't do that.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.860
We cannot do that.

40:14.860 --> 40:16.860
We build mathematical models, and here

40:16.860 --> 40:20.220
is the model that we introduced earlier, the standard model,

40:20.220 --> 40:22.500
to describe nature and to mock up nature

40:22.500 --> 40:25.980
and maybe glean some principles that nature realizes,

40:25.980 --> 40:27.860
but that is not a prescription.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.700
So there is this great painting.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.460
It says, this is not a pipe.

40:32.460 --> 40:36.140
I will spare the Quebecois, my attempted French.

40:36.140 --> 40:39.020
But when we do theoretical physics,

40:39.020 --> 40:41.420
we are exploring what types of models

40:41.420 --> 40:43.460
can explain the dark matter puzzle

40:43.460 --> 40:46.940
and what can we learn from those mathematical models.

40:46.940 --> 40:50.380
And like any good crime procedural,

40:50.380 --> 40:52.980
there is a motive, means, and opportunity.

40:52.980 --> 40:56.260
A mathematical model for dark matter

40:56.260 --> 40:58.340
answers these questions.

40:58.340 --> 41:00.860
First one is, what is it?

41:00.860 --> 41:04.460
Some super symmetric partner, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

41:04.460 --> 41:06.820
The next thing is, how did it get here?

41:06.820 --> 41:11.340
You have to explain what mechanism created this particle.

41:11.340 --> 41:13.860
Then most of the particles that we know of

41:13.860 --> 41:15.540
are actually unstable.

41:15.540 --> 41:19.620
You have to explain, why is that particle still around?

41:19.620 --> 41:21.580
And given that we've been searching for dark matter

41:21.580 --> 41:23.780
for 30 years, then your theory has

41:23.780 --> 41:27.020
to say why we haven't found it yet.

41:27.020 --> 41:31.820
And any theory worth its weight will tell you,

41:31.820 --> 41:35.300
and this is how you will discover this type of particle.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.940
It'll give you something falsifiable.

41:37.940 --> 41:40.780
And so for the weekly interacting massive particle,

41:40.780 --> 41:43.100
there is some deep, elegant mathematical symmetry

41:43.100 --> 41:45.460
that explains to you what this new particle is.

41:45.460 --> 41:48.900
And that was very deep, and exciting, and meaningful.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.060
Then there's a series of answers.

41:51.060 --> 41:52.140
How did it get here?

41:52.140 --> 41:54.140
Well, the same way that ordinary particles got here

41:54.140 --> 41:55.460
through something called thermal freeze out,

41:55.460 --> 41:57.460
that was the calculation that we asked the grad student

41:57.460 --> 42:00.580
to do over and over and over again.

42:00.580 --> 42:01.500
Why is it still here?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.740
We have to put that band-aid on.

42:02.740 --> 42:04.100
Remember, if you put this band-aid on,

42:04.100 --> 42:08.540
you solve some problems, and for free you get stable particles.

42:08.540 --> 42:09.860
Why isn't it ruled out?

42:09.860 --> 42:15.340
Well, for all we know, dark matter might still be a wimp.

42:15.340 --> 42:16.700
How do we discover it?

42:16.700 --> 42:19.220
For the wimp, we keep doing exactly what we are doing,

42:19.220 --> 42:21.780
because we have the experimental program to probe this.

42:25.940 --> 42:28.860
But there are other answers to these questions.

42:28.860 --> 42:32.300
Maybe it's less interesting what the deep mathematical

42:32.300 --> 42:34.380
principle is before.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.980
Maybe we start with, there is dark matter.

42:36.980 --> 42:40.300
Let's build the simplest building blocks, the simplest

42:40.300 --> 42:42.460
LEGO model, the simplest mathematical model,

42:42.460 --> 42:44.260
and see what comes out.

42:44.260 --> 42:46.140
And then, how do you discover it?

42:46.140 --> 42:48.060
You start thinking more creatively.

42:48.060 --> 42:50.020
If there are different answers to how to get here,

42:50.020 --> 42:51.580
you have different interactions, which

42:51.580 --> 42:53.180
means there are different reasons why it's stable,

42:53.180 --> 42:55.940
and you have different ways in which it'll manifest itself.

42:55.940 --> 42:57.220
And one of the really great things

42:57.220 --> 42:59.020
we've been talking about over the past three days here

42:59.020 --> 43:02.900
at Perimeter is one puzzle that I'll shout out, which

43:02.900 --> 43:06.260
is there are a handful of black holes.

43:06.260 --> 43:08.820
So this is a quasar with an artist's rendition.

43:08.820 --> 43:09.940
There's a handful of these.

43:09.940 --> 43:13.620
So our galaxy is far, far away that

43:13.620 --> 43:16.940
are powered by a supermassive black hole.

43:16.940 --> 43:18.580
And what's the difference between a black hole

43:18.580 --> 43:20.100
and a supermassive black hole?

43:20.100 --> 43:22.260
The supermassive black hole is so large

43:22.260 --> 43:25.300
that our understanding of how black holes form

43:25.300 --> 43:29.780
cannot explain how they got so down large.

43:29.780 --> 43:34.620
And the usual story is that first you form stars,

43:34.620 --> 43:35.980
and stars form little black holes.

43:35.980 --> 43:38.020
Little black holes combine to form big black holes.

43:38.020 --> 43:39.500
But that cannot happen fast enough

43:39.500 --> 43:41.900
to explain these gigantic black holes.

43:41.900 --> 43:44.380
And one of the really cool things that we've been doing,

43:44.380 --> 43:46.980
this is a photo taken earlier today,

43:46.980 --> 43:49.740
has been puzzling over the ways in which the dark matter, which

43:49.740 --> 43:51.740
we know was already in these galaxies,

43:51.740 --> 43:54.380
because they held the galaxy together,

43:54.380 --> 43:56.940
might be contributing to answering this puzzle.

43:56.940 --> 43:59.220
And how this puzzle might be the first step

43:59.220 --> 44:03.180
in this refined way of looking at this open question of learning

44:03.180 --> 44:04.500
something new about dark matter.

44:04.500 --> 44:07.700
All right.

44:07.700 --> 44:10.380
So this is just a slice of the type of really exciting types

44:10.380 --> 44:13.580
of questions that we've been thinking about.

44:13.580 --> 44:16.900
Now, I want to change gears here and answer the who.

44:16.900 --> 44:19.140
So who gets to do this thing?

44:19.140 --> 44:24.380
Who gets the privilege of exploring the cosmos

44:24.380 --> 44:27.380
using theoretical physics?

44:27.380 --> 44:30.820
And there's an analogy that we often use.

44:30.820 --> 44:31.940
Dark matter is in dark.

44:31.940 --> 44:34.020
It's invisible.

44:34.020 --> 44:36.900
And the analogy has to do with equity and diversity

44:36.900 --> 44:39.100
in physics.

44:39.100 --> 44:41.420
It's probably not surprising that such an analogy would

44:41.420 --> 44:42.060
come about.

44:42.060 --> 44:44.740
There are a few different analogies.

44:44.740 --> 44:46.500
And in the same way that dark matter

44:46.500 --> 44:49.940
is a puzzle of missing mass, mass that we don't understand

44:49.940 --> 44:51.540
what it is or where it came from,

44:51.540 --> 44:53.380
there's just missing talent puzzle.

44:53.380 --> 44:57.220
Oftentimes, when you walk into a room in a physics department,

44:57.220 --> 45:00.420
the people that you see there have a different demographic

45:00.420 --> 45:05.340
makeup than the people that you see outside the university.

45:05.340 --> 45:08.660
And the analogy here is, why is it

45:08.660 --> 45:11.020
that we've discovered all this stuff about atoms?

45:11.020 --> 45:12.820
Like, we know all sorts about chemistry.

45:12.820 --> 45:14.340
We know about biology.

45:14.340 --> 45:18.860
It's because ordinary matter, protons, electrons, neutrons,

45:18.860 --> 45:21.940
and trinos, well, not neutrinos, are charged

45:21.940 --> 45:23.420
under electromagnetism.

45:23.420 --> 45:26.340
That is the probe that we use to see, smell, taste, hear

45:26.340 --> 45:28.780
everything about matter.

45:28.780 --> 45:30.900
Dark matter does not seem to have

45:30.900 --> 45:32.740
that privilege of being charged.

45:32.740 --> 45:35.700
That means our telescopes, our microscopes, all our tools

45:35.700 --> 45:37.860
do not automatically work the way

45:37.860 --> 45:39.580
that they do for ordinary matter.

45:39.580 --> 45:41.580
That doesn't mean that dark matter doesn't exist.

45:41.580 --> 45:44.620
That does not mean that the talent doesn't exist.

45:44.620 --> 45:47.300
And there's a lot of fantastic books writing about what this is.

45:47.300 --> 45:49.660
These are people who are far ahead of their journey

45:49.660 --> 45:51.220
in thinking about this puzzle than I am.

45:51.220 --> 45:55.020
And I encourage you to take a look if you're interested.

45:55.020 --> 45:57.260
But another way in which this is analogous to the puzzle

45:57.300 --> 46:02.380
of dark matter is that this is not a puzzle of missing data.

46:02.380 --> 46:05.940
Just like Katie's slide, we have many, many reasons

46:05.940 --> 46:08.500
to believe that there is a missing mass problem.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.700
And there is no shortage of data that

46:10.700 --> 46:12.860
across different types of demographic slices,

46:12.860 --> 46:16.340
whether it's gender or ethnicity or unseen things

46:16.340 --> 46:20.220
like socioeconomic background, belief, political background,

46:20.220 --> 46:23.780
all of these things, the demographic inside the ivory

46:23.780 --> 46:27.660
tower is different from the demographic outside.

46:27.660 --> 46:29.900
So it's not a matter of missing data

46:29.900 --> 46:34.140
or orders of magnitude in astronomical observations.

46:34.140 --> 46:37.700
Like the puzzle of dark matter, maybe the way

46:37.700 --> 46:42.180
that we have been doing things might not be the best way.

46:42.180 --> 46:44.780
Maybe there should be new approaches

46:44.780 --> 46:47.700
and new theoretical instructions, new frameworks

46:47.700 --> 46:50.980
to approach this puzzle.

46:51.020 --> 46:53.940
And when we think about this, there's

46:53.940 --> 46:58.220
something that oftentimes well-meaning people will say

46:58.220 --> 47:00.540
in earnestness.

47:00.540 --> 47:03.300
Well, but physics doesn't care about the color of your skin

47:03.300 --> 47:04.420
or your race or your gender.

47:04.420 --> 47:06.340
Maxwell's equations are indifferent to the human

47:06.340 --> 47:08.540
who is creating them, right?

47:08.540 --> 47:10.700
It's a reasonable thing to say.

47:10.700 --> 47:13.580
But oftentimes, the people who say this at one stage

47:13.580 --> 47:15.860
of their career go on.

47:15.860 --> 47:17.980
And then there's inevitably some road bump,

47:17.980 --> 47:19.500
because we all hit road bumps.

47:19.620 --> 47:21.620
And then there are different things that are said.

47:21.620 --> 47:24.180
Oh, well, the committee would have selected me

47:24.180 --> 47:27.940
if only I had this fancier university on my diploma,

47:27.940 --> 47:31.780
if only I had this fancier knickknack on my CV.

47:31.780 --> 47:35.860
Or if only I had advanced calculus when I was in high school,

47:35.860 --> 47:39.740
I'd be able to do research when I was my first year of college.

47:39.740 --> 47:42.780
Or when one's hand is the only brown hand in the classroom,

47:42.780 --> 47:44.460
maybe it's a little bit harder to be the one

47:44.460 --> 47:46.660
to ask a question.

47:46.660 --> 47:49.620
And I mention these because these

47:49.620 --> 47:54.780
are sociological human issues, even though the subject itself

47:54.780 --> 47:57.220
is indifferent to the humanity.

47:57.220 --> 48:03.900
And to be able to do this, this is a human endeavor.

48:07.180 --> 48:10.860
I argue, though, this is still the wrong way

48:10.860 --> 48:13.340
of thinking about it.

48:13.340 --> 48:15.220
So how many people here saw Oppenheimer?

48:17.620 --> 48:21.100
That's a smaller percentage than I expected.

48:21.100 --> 48:24.940
So one of the characters in Oppenheimer is Vannevar Bush.

48:24.940 --> 48:26.460
This is his character over here.

48:26.460 --> 48:27.940
And for those of you who saw the movie,

48:27.940 --> 48:30.820
the person he's shaking hands with is the villain.

48:30.820 --> 48:33.740
But Vannevar Bush was the architect

48:33.740 --> 48:37.540
of what is now known as the National Science Foundation.

48:37.540 --> 48:42.180
And this is the report written during wartime

48:42.220 --> 48:45.460
where Vannevar Bush advocated for the US

48:45.460 --> 48:50.660
to form a funding body to support not applied research, not

48:50.660 --> 48:53.620
military research, but research in fundamental science.

48:56.100 --> 48:59.580
I will say that the National Science Foundation

48:59.580 --> 49:04.460
and its cousin in Canada, NSERC, have been perhaps

49:04.460 --> 49:08.340
the greatest forces in fundamental science

49:08.340 --> 49:10.540
in the history of mankind.

49:10.540 --> 49:15.140
And I do not mean that, ironically, this is true.

49:15.140 --> 49:18.340
The commitment to fundamental research

49:18.340 --> 49:21.860
that these institutions have put forward.

49:21.860 --> 49:23.820
I would say that even if I were not currently

49:23.820 --> 49:25.700
funded by the National Science Foundation,

49:25.700 --> 49:28.740
but I feel like I should mention that.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.300
But this is true.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.940
And this report is online.

49:31.940 --> 49:35.300
If you look into this report, there

49:35.300 --> 49:39.500
is this phrase by a chemist, James Conant,

49:39.500 --> 49:43.140
in every section of the entire area of the word,

49:43.140 --> 49:48.340
every section where the word science may be applied,

49:48.340 --> 49:53.420
the limiting factor is human.

49:53.420 --> 49:55.940
The limiting factor is human.

49:55.940 --> 49:59.260
And so here is the version from Perimeter Institute.

49:59.260 --> 50:01.540
Rob Myers, the director of Perimeter Institute.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.980
We can't afford to leave any great thinkers

50:03.980 --> 50:06.540
or any great ideas behind.

50:06.540 --> 50:09.460
The limiting factor is human.

50:09.460 --> 50:11.980
So you might have the best microscope

50:11.980 --> 50:13.500
humanity has ever built.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.620
You might have the most pristine environments

50:15.620 --> 50:18.060
to look for dark matter scattering off a nuclei.

50:18.060 --> 50:20.740
You might have the ability to see with finer resolution

50:20.740 --> 50:23.380
than ever before the first light of the universe.

50:23.380 --> 50:25.940
And you might have a damn new way of seeing the universe

50:25.940 --> 50:28.020
itself.

50:28.020 --> 50:33.100
But the thing that is holding us back is human.

50:33.100 --> 50:35.260
This is the value of places like Perimeter.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.980
This is where the progress is.

50:37.020 --> 50:40.380
And if you ask purely about scientific interest,

50:40.380 --> 50:42.180
you're saying nothing about fairness or equity

50:42.180 --> 50:44.180
or any of these things.

50:44.180 --> 50:49.220
When you want to draw people to this column,

50:49.220 --> 50:52.740
you want the people who will sacrifice and work hard

50:52.740 --> 50:53.980
and who are willing to do this.

50:53.980 --> 50:57.540
This is a hard job and it's difficult work, tough problems.

50:57.540 --> 51:02.660
You want to be able to draw from not just the 15%,

51:02.660 --> 51:06.780
you want that entire 100%.

51:06.940 --> 51:09.620
The power of full participation is analogous

51:09.620 --> 51:10.460
to the standard model.

51:10.460 --> 51:12.340
The standard model does a lot of great things.

51:12.340 --> 51:14.180
Chemistry is because of the standard model of particle

51:14.180 --> 51:15.700
physics.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.780
But dark matter creates galaxies.

51:20.460 --> 51:25.260
So let's do one last question.

51:25.260 --> 51:28.900
That's how we do it, who does it, who gets to do it.

51:28.900 --> 51:31.020
Why do we do this?

51:31.020 --> 51:33.220
And whenever I think about this, there's

51:33.220 --> 51:34.340
a painting by Paul Gauguin.

51:34.340 --> 51:35.780
Who are we, where do we come from,

51:35.820 --> 51:37.420
where are we going in some order?

51:37.420 --> 51:40.940
And I think about this, why do we do science?

51:40.940 --> 51:42.660
I think about this painting because it reminds me

51:42.660 --> 51:47.100
that every culture for as long as humanity has been human

51:47.100 --> 51:51.220
has had a story, has had a cosmology of how we belong,

51:51.220 --> 51:56.300
how we came to be who we are, where we came from.

51:56.300 --> 51:58.900
Right now, science is part of our cosmology

51:58.900 --> 52:02.380
as a global human species.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.740
And we have our own story.

52:04.740 --> 52:06.180
And that story is something like this.

52:08.820 --> 52:11.580
13 billion years ago-ish, there was something called

52:11.580 --> 52:12.220
the Big Bang.

52:12.220 --> 52:14.300
We don't quite understand what happened.

52:14.300 --> 52:16.220
It's curious.

52:16.220 --> 52:18.620
The Big Bang formed a lot of the matter and stuff

52:18.620 --> 52:20.020
in our universe.

52:20.020 --> 52:22.420
A good chunk of that stuff is dark matter, which you see here

52:22.420 --> 52:24.060
in these weird filaments.

52:24.060 --> 52:26.180
The universe expanded rapidly and cooled down,

52:26.180 --> 52:27.660
and these filaments condensed.

52:30.660 --> 52:32.100
Where these filaments overlap, there

52:32.100 --> 52:34.420
is an over-density of gravity.

52:34.420 --> 52:37.140
They started pulling in more dark matter.

52:37.140 --> 52:39.860
That dark matter over-density then

52:39.860 --> 52:42.740
had a bigger gravitational pull, and started pulling in

52:42.740 --> 52:45.900
this really funny stuff called hydrogen gas.

52:45.900 --> 52:48.700
And that hydrogen gas collected into this clump of dark matter,

52:48.700 --> 52:51.380
and eventually the hydrogen gas found each other,

52:51.380 --> 52:54.340
and they started forming these funny things called stars.

52:54.340 --> 52:56.980
Some of those stars would go supernova and produce metals,

52:56.980 --> 52:59.860
and you would form more complex stars.

52:59.860 --> 53:03.620
Those would get together into things called galaxies.

53:03.620 --> 53:06.140
In the galaxies, you find these little solar systems,

53:06.140 --> 53:11.660
and the next thing you know, there's a planet called Earth,

53:11.660 --> 53:16.860
and there are these people who are little goldfish, who

53:16.860 --> 53:20.420
are just discovering the dark matter ocean that we happen

53:20.420 --> 53:21.940
to be living in.

53:21.940 --> 53:24.100
And that is why we do this.

53:24.100 --> 53:25.140
So thank you very much.

53:25.140 --> 53:25.640
Thank you.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.220
Thank you so much.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.540
All right, so we have time for questions.

53:44.540 --> 53:47.220
So as I said before, there's a microphone there on the stairs.

53:47.220 --> 53:49.620
So if you have a question, please make your way

53:49.620 --> 53:51.820
to the microphone if you can.

53:51.820 --> 53:54.820
I'm more from a philosophy background,

53:54.820 --> 53:57.300
and I don't know if they like that question.

53:57.300 --> 54:01.700
Have you heard of flies too young for the empiricism?

54:01.700 --> 54:02.660
No, I'm not familiar with it.

54:02.660 --> 54:03.660
Sorry.

54:03.660 --> 54:05.060
Should you stand up for the microphone?

54:05.060 --> 54:06.300
Here we have flies, which is called

54:06.300 --> 54:10.100
the Undetermination of Theory by Experiment.

54:10.100 --> 54:12.300
Ah, OK.

54:12.300 --> 54:13.340
Do you want me to explain it?

54:13.340 --> 54:14.340
Please.

54:14.340 --> 54:19.500
The Hammers had a great influence on Einstein and Mark.

54:19.500 --> 54:28.900
He wrote a book on the nature of physics in 1908, I believe.

54:28.900 --> 54:33.100
And what he was claiming that every theory involves

54:33.100 --> 54:36.100
theses that can never be reduced together.

54:36.100 --> 54:38.300
So it kind of confirms what you're saying.

54:38.300 --> 54:42.380
So let's say a theory how a telescope works

54:42.380 --> 54:44.100
is part of your structure.

54:44.100 --> 54:48.180
But the theory of light, of how that new telescope works,

54:48.180 --> 54:50.220
you have to, is part of the theory.

54:50.220 --> 54:52.820
So you can never go to a groundwork.

54:52.820 --> 54:56.020
He actually criticized Carl Popper, who thought that everything

54:56.020 --> 54:58.260
had to be verifiable.

54:58.260 --> 55:01.140
And he said, no, he can never do that.

55:01.140 --> 55:03.900
And he thought even basic ideas of physics,

55:03.900 --> 55:06.660
like motion and stuff like that, we

55:06.660 --> 55:08.740
also have to have a point of reference.

55:08.740 --> 55:10.700
But everything in the universe is moving.

55:10.700 --> 55:13.700
So how do you have a point of reference for all the motions

55:13.700 --> 55:14.500
of the universe?

55:14.500 --> 55:16.700
So that's the basic thesis.

55:16.700 --> 55:19.100
So that's called the Dhamm-Quine thesis.

55:19.100 --> 55:21.020
And it's one of the most important things

55:21.020 --> 55:22.980
in 20th century philosophy.

55:22.980 --> 55:25.380
And it's called Two Dogmas of Appearicism.

55:25.380 --> 55:28.460
And what Quine was saying about the dogmas of empiricism

55:28.460 --> 55:30.780
is that we have a way we, a plant had the idea

55:30.780 --> 55:33.060
of the way we think of the world and the way the world is.

55:33.060 --> 55:35.860
And he created this idea of the thing of itself.

55:35.860 --> 55:38.180
And Quine attacks that idea and says

55:38.180 --> 55:39.780
it's a false idea.

55:39.780 --> 55:43.580
Because how we perceive things is then changed.

55:43.580 --> 55:45.580
So the theory, we don't work that way.

55:45.580 --> 55:47.660
And the things get actually mixed together.

55:47.660 --> 55:48.820
So that's the basis thesis.

55:48.820 --> 55:49.780
So you might want to look it up.

55:49.780 --> 55:53.320
It's called Two Dogmas of Empiricism by Willard Van

55:53.320 --> 55:53.820
Wook.

55:53.820 --> 55:56.420
And it confirms exactly what you're saying in a certain way.

55:56.420 --> 55:59.780
So yeah, I can offer.

55:59.780 --> 56:02.020
I'm afraid of saying this in the wrong way.

56:02.020 --> 56:05.180
My best friend that usually represents a philosopher.

56:05.180 --> 56:08.380
And I'll say one short thing on that, which I thank you

56:08.380 --> 56:10.300
very much for sharing that.

56:10.300 --> 56:12.860
Part of what I wanted to share here

56:12.860 --> 56:16.700
was the way in which my sub-tribe of particle theory

56:16.700 --> 56:17.940
thinks about theories.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.780
And what you're saying is exactly,

56:19.780 --> 56:23.700
it is a philosophical question.

56:23.700 --> 56:26.420
But thinking about capital T theory,

56:26.420 --> 56:30.580
where this is some framework for everything.

56:30.580 --> 56:34.220
And I think what's relevant here epistemologically

56:34.220 --> 56:37.100
is that the theories that I'm talking about here

56:37.100 --> 56:38.260
are lower case T theories.

56:38.260 --> 56:40.460
And that's why I emphasize by the Lego analogy

56:40.460 --> 56:43.420
that these are toys that are meant to do one thing.

56:43.420 --> 56:46.580
And that's exactly what the answer is and why it's so low.

56:46.580 --> 56:50.340
And actually, there's a philosopher of QT called

56:50.340 --> 56:52.620
Basque-on-Frasen, and he said that as well.

56:52.620 --> 56:56.260
So all three of you effectively agree on that theory.

56:56.260 --> 56:57.180
Thank you for that.

56:57.180 --> 57:00.340
Yeah, so we have some questions from the online audience.

57:00.340 --> 57:01.980
And if you have questions in the audience,

57:01.980 --> 57:05.700
please feel free to make your way to the microphone.

57:05.700 --> 57:07.180
So let's see.

57:07.180 --> 57:11.100
We have plenty of questions from online.

57:11.100 --> 57:12.820
So here's a good one.

57:12.820 --> 57:16.860
If we found Dark Matter, what other physics mysteries

57:16.860 --> 57:19.940
would be easier to solve with that new information?

57:19.940 --> 57:21.260
That is a really good question.

57:21.260 --> 57:25.780
Thank you, person in the universe who asked this.

57:25.780 --> 57:28.100
We have a list of puzzles.

57:28.100 --> 57:32.700
And depending on what it is that we find, how we find it,

57:32.700 --> 57:35.380
there are different ways of piecing that into these puzzles.

57:35.420 --> 57:37.900
And so one way of playing this game that we play as particle

57:37.900 --> 57:41.340
theorists is pick your favorite particle physics problem.

57:41.340 --> 57:43.420
Why is there more antimatter than matter?

57:43.420 --> 57:46.780
So why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe?

57:46.780 --> 57:50.660
Why is it that certain particles have these weird properties?

57:50.660 --> 57:53.100
Why is it that the Higgs boson is light?

57:53.100 --> 57:54.660
That problem is still out there.

57:54.660 --> 57:57.620
And then you play this game of there's

57:57.620 --> 57:59.300
this new telescope coming online.

57:59.300 --> 58:01.660
If that telescope has this new ability

58:01.660 --> 58:03.220
to see the world in a certain way,

58:03.260 --> 58:08.340
what implications does my proposed model, my toy theory,

58:08.340 --> 58:10.580
imply for that telescope?

58:10.580 --> 58:13.340
And so there's this whole, in fact, in our conference,

58:13.340 --> 58:17.300
we had this fantastic figure, it was a flow chart of,

58:17.300 --> 58:20.500
if you see this, then what do you think it could be

58:20.500 --> 58:23.020
and what is the next experiment that you do to verify that?

58:23.020 --> 58:25.620
But the question hits exactly at the heart of what

58:25.620 --> 58:26.740
it is that we're doing.

58:26.740 --> 58:27.700
That's great.

58:27.700 --> 58:29.500
Go ahead.

58:29.500 --> 58:33.420
Can you comment on the modified gravity theory

58:33.420 --> 58:39.500
introduced by John Moffat that claims to explain cosmological

58:39.500 --> 58:41.060
data without dark matter?

58:41.060 --> 58:42.460
This is a fantastic question.

58:42.460 --> 58:43.460
Thank you.

58:43.460 --> 58:47.980
So modified gravity or cousins modified Newtonian dynamics,

58:47.980 --> 58:50.580
this is an alternative to what I was saying where

58:50.580 --> 58:52.900
let's all get on the same page in dark matters and new particles.

58:52.900 --> 58:54.700
Thank you very much for pointing this out.

58:54.700 --> 58:58.420
And so this is a different proposal.

58:58.420 --> 59:00.660
People have different opinions about the viability

59:00.660 --> 59:06.940
of these proposals, embedding into a full capital T theory.

59:06.940 --> 59:10.740
But that's all human opinion.

59:10.740 --> 59:12.340
We call it Bayesian priors.

59:12.340 --> 59:14.260
What a good theory ought to look like.

59:14.260 --> 59:18.100
What's really neat about modified gravity

59:18.100 --> 59:22.540
is that it is a proposal that has value in the space

59:22.540 --> 59:23.940
of understanding what dark matter is.

59:23.940 --> 59:25.300
And I'll give you an example of this.

59:25.300 --> 59:27.180
So even in my tribe, there's this idea

59:27.180 --> 59:29.060
called self-interacting dark matter.

59:29.060 --> 59:30.420
Dark matter isn't just inert.

59:30.420 --> 59:34.260
Sometimes it bounces off of itself.

59:34.260 --> 59:36.860
And what modified Newtonian dynamics tells you

59:36.860 --> 59:39.300
is that maybe gravity behaves a little bit differently

59:39.300 --> 59:42.100
on different scales.

59:42.100 --> 59:44.580
One of my colleagues at UC Riverside, Hybo-U,

59:44.580 --> 59:48.100
realized that, oh, that theory has some merit

59:48.100 --> 59:49.220
in connecting to experiments.

59:49.220 --> 59:50.940
That's really exciting.

59:50.940 --> 59:53.740
I have my own pet theory if that dark matter will bounce off

59:53.740 --> 59:55.740
of itself.

59:55.740 --> 59:58.500
And if dark matter bounces off of itself,

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.860
the distribution of dark matter in these bubbles,

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.900
in these halos, would be different.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.620
It'd be more puffy.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.540
It's like a popcorn machine.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.300
And if dark matter is more puffy,

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.900
that means the gravitational interaction,

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.420
the net gravitational interaction,

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.500
will be a little bit different.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.900
And if it's different just the right way,

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.380
it can end up looking like modified Newtonian dynamics.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.700
And say whichever tribe you follow,

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.540
and whatever you prefer as a human being,

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.980
experiments will figure things out ultimately.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.460
But the fact that there's this idea

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.580
led to cross-pollination of new ideas and new observables.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.740
And this is the key point.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.060
What happened was the community was

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.900
able to say, we should look for this type of observables

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.380
in our new telescopes.

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.580
And that will teach us something.

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.940
And so I know a lot of the way people frame this

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.580
is as a debate between one camp versus another camp.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.740
We're all on the same team trying

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.660
to discover truth here.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.820
And I think that's a really fantastic example of that.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:01.060
Hi, thanks a lot.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.820
Hello, thank you.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.220
Pretty simplistic question, I think.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.900
My background on this is so elementary,

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.020
so please forgive the silliness of the question

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:11.980
if it comes off that way.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.180
You know you start the question.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.060
Now I'm terrified.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.900
The idea that dark matter, the candidate for dark matter

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.460
that you're discussing, is a massive particle.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.300
The fact that there's like 85%, et cetera.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.580
Like instead of it being a few massive particles,

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.700
what about a whole lot of really light particles?

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:35.660
And is that still in the running?

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.700
Very good.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.940
That is not a simple question.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.100
That is a deep and insightful question.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.540
And that's a question that we ask ourselves over and over

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.340
again.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.180
Good, the mass range for plausible dark matter candidates,

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.340
which again plausible is something

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:52.340
that human beings make up, is actually incredibly wide.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.060
On the one end, you could have gigantic, 10 to the 30 solar

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.540
mass black holes.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.380
On the other end, you could have things

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.020
which one would barely call a particle quantum

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.260
mechanically.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.300
What I will offer here, instead of just saying,

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.140
could be anything, what I will offer here is, OK,

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.500
what do we know about dark matter?

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.860
The puzzle exists.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.620
We also know roughly how much there is.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.900
And there's one other thing I hadn't yet told you.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.740
We also know, in fact, the way to say,

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.620
dark matter is cool.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.420
And not just in the hip way, but it's

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.380
cool that it is cold.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.180
It's non-relativistic.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.420
Today, dark matter isn't traveling very fast.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.100
And we know that because it had to form these bubbles,

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.380
these halos, that were needed to collect the hydrogen,

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.860
to form stars, to form everything.

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.740
So the limits on can dark matter be a bunch of light things

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.620
rather than a few heavy things is actually

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.060
set by, if they're very light, are they also moving very fast?

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.420
And if they're moving too fast, you can't do it.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.060
So it's a very deep question.

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.980
And you actually have the exactly right intuition

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.420
that you can have a bunch of heavy things,

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.180
or a bunch of light things, which

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.740
would be equivalent gravitationally,

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.980
to a few heavy things.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.340
So yeah, thank you.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.540
All right.

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:11.020
Thank you so much to all of the folks who asked questions.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.340
Thank you to our online audience.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.700
And thank you so much to Professor Tenedo.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.200
Thank you.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:15.700
Thank you.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.200
Thank you.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.200
Thank you.
