30000	44040	Hello, bonjour, bienvenue, and welcome everyone to Perimeter Institute's public lecture series.
44040	48880	My name is Emily Petroff, and I'm Perimeter's Associate Director for Strategic Partnerships,
48880	50120	Grants and Awards.
50120	54680	I'm delighted to welcome you back to the Mike Lazaridis Theatre of Ideas here at the Perimeter
54680	56680	Institute in Waterloo.
56680	62040	It's a great pleasure to welcome you tonight at the Perimeter Institute for those of you
62040	66240	who are sure we'll have a fascinating presentation.
66240	70720	Perimeter Institute was created to be a gathering place where people can come together like
70720	75080	we're doing tonight to ask the big questions about the universe and search for the big
75080	77040	answers.
77040	83160	Perimeter will soon celebrate 25 years of bringing people together from all paths, researchers,
83160	89560	students, the general public, teachers, to explore the fascinating world of physics.
89560	93080	But people on this land have been asking the big questions about the universe for thousands
93080	94580	of years.
94580	99040	Looking up at the night sky and understanding our place in the cosmos is a human constant
99040	100960	throughout the ages.
100960	104800	We acknowledge that Perimeter Institute is situated on the traditional territory of the
104800	110200	Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, and Neutral Peoples, and is located on the Haldeman Tract, the
110200	114960	tract granted by the British, to the six nations of the Grand River, and the Mississaugas of
114960	117280	the Credit First Nation.
117280	123000	We greet and thank the diverse peoples who preceded us, and we encourage them to act
123000	129440	responsibly and collaboratively to advance the quest of knowledge for the good of all.
129440	138640	We thank the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Neutral Peoples for their support.
138640	142880	For those watching the live webcast, please join the conversation online.
142880	147040	We are at Perimeter on Twitter, or X, and if you have a question for our speaker, you
147040	150600	can ask it with the hashtag PI Live.
150600	155040	This week, Perimeter Institute has been hosting a fascinating workshop called Dark Matter First
155040	160280	Light, which brings together experts to discuss the ways that dark matter impacts the formation
160280	163760	and evolution of stars and galaxies.
163760	168760	This workshop, which concluded today, focused on the new observational programs and techniques
168760	174120	coming online and new modeling tools that may enable a better understanding of the mysterious
174120	179040	matter you'll hear more about tonight.
179040	183840	And now, it is my great pleasure to introduce one of those workshop attendees and our speaker
183840	185680	for tonight.
185680	190040	Theoretical physicist Philip Flip Tenedo is an associate professor at the University
190040	194480	of California, Riverside, and his research seeks to determine the fundamental physics
194480	196240	of dark matter.
196240	201800	He's a 2021 career award winner from the U.S. National Science Foundation and a 2020
201800	203000	Hellman Fellow.
203000	206800	He has appeared in popular media on shows like Nova and Science Friday.
206800	211480	Dr. Tenedo grew up in Los Angeles and is a proud product of the Los Angeles Unified
211480	212880	School District.
212880	216960	He earned his bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics from Stanford University
217200	222480	before completing graduate studies at Cambridge University, Durham University, and Cornell.
222480	226440	He spent three years as a chancellor's advanced postdoctoral fellow at the University of
226440	229760	California, Irvine, before moving to Riverside.
229760	234920	Dr. Tenedo is the first Filipino-American professor of physics and he has served in
234920	239560	several official capacities as an advocate for equity and academia.
239560	244040	His research focuses on developing a fundamental theory of dark matter.
244120	248040	His work has interesting intersections with fields including particle cosmology, machine
248040	250040	learning, and information.
250040	254480	Tonight he will discuss recent developments in the search for dark matter and how the
254480	258120	scientific community can come together to find new answers.
258120	262960	Please join me in welcoming to the stage Professor Flip Tenedo.
262960	276520	Good evening everybody.
276520	277720	My name is Flip.
277720	282800	I am a theoretical physicist and I work on dark matter.
282800	284840	So quick show of hands.
284840	287640	How many people have heard of dark matter?
287640	288640	Good.
288640	289640	Good.
289640	290640	Good.
290640	291640	Good.
291640	294920	You know what dark matter is?
294920	296800	One hand up.
296800	298280	So we're all in good company.
298280	299960	We are all in the same tribe.
299960	300960	Very good.
300960	303720	We're all in the same boat.
303720	304720	All right.
304720	307040	So let's get started.
307040	312200	Here is my very best attempt at a completely realistic picture of dark matter.
312200	313920	It's completely invisible.
313920	314920	Okay.
314920	318040	So that's not very interesting.
318040	322160	If you'll permit me a little bit of artistic license.
322160	325080	Here is astronomers up to false color of their photos.
325080	329680	Here is a false color illustration of dark matter.
329680	333360	And I've even done the extra work of sketching where we are.
333360	335120	This is the Milky Way.
335120	341440	And we're sitting in this bubble of dark matter, this big blue bubble of dark matter.
341440	347800	And if we were to zoom out again in this artistic rendition, we would notice that our bubble
347800	354920	of dark matter is actually sitting in a cluster of bubbles of dark matter.
354920	356400	And I didn't draw it here.
356400	364040	But if you looked into each of these bubbles, most of them also happen to have galaxies
364040	365040	sitting there.
365040	367280	That's interesting.
367280	373080	And David Foster Wallace had a story once where there were two fish who meet in the
373080	374480	ocean.
374480	380600	And the first fish says, isn't it great that we have water?
380600	387760	And the second fish says, what the hell is water?
387760	394560	And this is where we are as a scientific community thinking about dark matter.
394560	400080	What we know is that we are little fish living in oceans of dark matter.
400080	404360	There are bubbles in a cluster of other bubbles of dark matter.
404360	409600	And there is so much that we do not know, but we know that that much is true.
409600	413200	And this is our cosmic mystery.
413200	417480	So like all mysteries, there's a who, what, when, where, why, and how.
417480	421240	And we won't quite go through them in this order.
421240	427120	This is a piece of art, it's an installation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
427120	430280	And in this dark matter business, we have a phrase that we overuse.
430280	435240	And the phrase is looking under lampposts, looking in the dark under lampposts, looking
435240	441720	for truth, finding some angle to learn about this mysterious thing that we're in.
441720	444160	So this is going to be our guidepost.
444160	449280	These are my attempts at lampposts for understanding not just what is the puzzle, but how is it
449280	454680	that me, a theoretical physicist, which you might already think and my colleagues do think,
454680	461480	what can you possibly do if you don't have a lab, am tasked with understanding a substance
461480	465880	that surrounds us that we can either see, nor touch, nor smell, nor taste, nor anything
465880	471880	else to the best of our knowledge and then somehow do science on this.
471880	474800	It's a bit of a tall order, isn't it?
474800	479320	So let's start with what.
479320	486360	And in fact, what I need from you today is to start with the assumption that dark matter
486360	492520	exists and there's one thing that we know pretty well, which is roughly how much there
492520	494200	is, right?
494200	498480	Of all this matter, all the stuff in the universe, all the things you would call chunky matter
498480	507080	like things, we're dark, we are about 15% and most of the rest of it is dark matter.
507080	509080	Are we okay with that?
509080	511480	We're all on board?
511480	513520	Anybody skeptical?
513520	517960	Any physics students in the room, any science students in the room, very good.
517960	519560	And I will speak for you.
519560	522560	You are all feeling very uncomfortable right now.
522560	526400	You do not like someone sitting here telling you there's this invisible thing that surrounds
526400	529880	the universe and it's real, I just need you to believe me.
529880	534640	All right, so let's not just take this completely on faith.
534640	539040	There is evidence for the existence of something more, something that we do not understand.
539040	541600	For these bubbles of dark matter that we live in.
541600	543880	And the evidence comes from the sky.
543880	551040	When we look at the motion of stars in galaxies, when we look at motions of clusters of galaxies
551040	555960	that happen to be pancaking towards each other in the distant sky.
555960	560960	And when we look at the photons from the cosmic microwave backgrounds, the very first photons
560960	567920	from 13 billion years ago reaching our telescopes today, each of these probes give indelible
567920	575400	evidence that there is stuff that is clumped up that cannot be explained by protons, neutrons
575400	580960	and electrons and their cousins.
580960	581960	Everybody convinced now?
581960	584720	Are we all on board?
584720	587160	Physics students are all on board?
587160	594560	Okay, so one of the organizers for the conference that I've just come from is Katie Mack who
594560	596040	is sitting here in the audience.
596040	598920	She's a faculty member here at PI.
598920	601760	You've heard of her?
601760	606640	And I had the special joy of attending one of Katie's colloquia at the Aspen Center
606640	608600	for Physics a few years ago.
608600	613320	And Katie gave us a fantastic talk which I am summarizing in this board which you cannot
613320	616360	read deliberately so because I don't want to give that talk.
616360	618080	I am not qualified to give that talk.
618080	624480	But here are 12 pieces of evidence that Katie has organized for why we are so sure that
624480	627320	dark matter exists.
627320	630680	Now you might be able to read the titles.
630680	634640	What is important here is that there are many reasons.
634640	637840	What is important here is that they're complementary.
637840	640600	And so it's not just that you see a few stars.
640600	641840	It's not just you see a galaxy cluster.
641840	646320	It's not just that you observe this cosmic microwave background.
646320	650120	That's like saying if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's probably a duck
650120	652200	and therefore dark matter.
652200	656480	But all of these different pieces of evidence are telling you.
656480	662560	Taking at different length scales, at different times in the cosmic history, it's not only
662560	666160	that it walks like a duck, it talks like a duck.
666160	673520	It's got feathers, a beak, it has duck DNA, and it tastes great with hoisin sauce.
673520	675960	So that doesn't mean that it is definitely dark matter.
675960	678440	Like this guy on stage is saying it's dark matter.
678440	685760	But what that does mean is if it is not dark matter, something really strange is going
685760	686760	on.
686760	691400	The most conservative thing we can say is that all of these different pieces of evidence
691400	696400	are pointing to something that looks like stuff matter.
696400	699040	That is not the stuff that we are used to.
699040	701280	So that's where we are.
701280	703640	It would be amazing if it weren't dark matter.
703640	707320	Something way more exciting is happening.
707320	711960	So the other thing that you might notice, all of this evidence is coming from the sky.
711960	713920	Astronomy and cosmology.
713920	720480	There is no problem with inferring that dark matter exists from astronomy and cosmology.
720480	723440	I am a theoretical particle physicist.
723440	726440	The problem is in my tribe.
726440	732120	The problem is what is this dark matter?
732120	738440	So let me jump to a very different type of question.
738440	742120	When is dark matter?
742120	745760	Why is it that we are studying dark matter now?
745760	748280	And this is where the apology of my talk comes in.
748280	752120	So let me give you a very biased, it's almost true.
752120	754840	Anybody here who is a specialist will know this is not quite true, but this is morally
754840	757760	true of history of dark matter.
757760	760240	And this is a history of two tribes.
760360	766320	So physics, where the problem is, and astronomy, where the observations are.
766320	775320	And this goes all the way back at least until Orton's wiki, who observed in the early telescopes
775320	783920	that the motion of galaxy clusters didn't quite match what they expected from the calculations
783920	784920	that they made.
785600	792160	And they said, hey, you know what, this data really looks consistent with missing matter
792160	796800	that is not the ordinary stars that we expect to see.
796800	802120	Now I wasn't around at the time, but I imagine what happened between the 1930s and the 1970s.
802120	805280	People said, well, that's kind of interesting, this is a brand new telescope, telescopes
805280	811600	are hard, we don't really understand these instruments, so who knows what's going on.
811600	817760	And in the 1970s, Vera Rubin also came to the same conclusion, looking at a completely
817760	822680	different scale, looking at spiral galaxies, like the spiral galaxy, the Milky Way that
822680	823680	we are in right now.
823680	827600	So this is a completely different system, right, as Vicki was looking at clusters of
827600	833040	galaxies, Rubin was looking at spiral galaxies, and the motion of stars within the spiral
833040	840400	galaxy also seemed to imply, oh, wait a second, there appears to be missing stuff.
840400	849640	Okay, now I imagine in the 1970s, if you were a particle physicist, a fundamental physicist,
849640	853360	whatever that means, and you just happened to be sitting there in your office, sitting
853360	858760	on your thumbs, not knowing what was going on, you had nothing better to do in your life,
858760	864000	nothing, you would have dropped everything and thought about this problem.
864000	868360	This would be the problem to solve.
868360	873640	It just so happens that in this other tribe, and usually the astronomy and the physics
873640	877160	floors, there are different floors in the building, so it really feels like a different
877160	882280	tribe, in this other tribe, something else was going on.
882280	888720	Around this period of time, particle physics, which was a new field, were building new toys,
888720	895880	these colliders where they're smashing together protons and elements, and producing all sorts
895880	899960	of new and unexpected particles.
899960	902880	And it was a puzzle, why are we getting all of these particles, where are they coming,
902880	905440	are they inside the atom, what does that mean?
905440	910960	And I will arbitrarily pick a period of 1970, so my higher mark will be the Nobel Prize
910960	915640	for what's called the electroweak theory.
915640	920480	There is a tremendous effort leading up to this and after this, but this is a benchmark
920480	926800	for me for the development theoretically of what we now know as the standard model of
926800	929120	particle physics.
929120	934960	And it was a heroic effort between experimental and theoretical physics to build this mathematical
934960	937520	edifice.
937520	943320	And there was one puzzle, which had obsessed the community, rightfully so, and that puzzle
943320	948880	had to do with the reason why we built the Large Hadron Collider and that thing is called
948880	950280	the Higgs Boson.
950280	953680	So how many people here have heard of the Higgs Boson?
953680	960320	I suspect it as much, I'm a crowd that comes to the perimeter institute in the snow outside.
960320	968160	So the story then, the apology then, is if we have known about missing matter for almost
968160	975440	a hundred years, why is it that we're talking about dark matter and the theoretical progress
975440	981920	in dark matter in the 2020s with fresh new oz?
981920	986000	So let me take you, let me continue this biased history.
986000	989280	Let's go back to my tribe, particle physics.
989280	993640	This edifice that we built up, the standard model, if you ask me, the standard model looks
993640	996680	like this.
996680	1001400	And if you wanted to be fancy and if you visited CERN, you can buy a mug like this, which is
1001400	1007560	roughly the mathematics behind this ugly thing.
1007560	1009840	This ugly thing is a table.
1009840	1015600	And it's a bit strange, but we've seen tables before.
1015600	1017960	Some of us have taken chemistry.
1017960	1021480	Those of us who did poorly in chemistry went on to do physics.
1021480	1026040	But in chemistry, you have the periodic table, right?
1026040	1030200	Anybody hear a chemist before I say a few chemists?
1030200	1037040	Now the periodic table, I'm going to guess not even chemists say, I love the periodic
1037040	1038040	table.
1038040	1042960	The periodic table is so great because I can look up any atomic number and learn the math
1042960	1044800	and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1044800	1049120	I think that's a fair statement.
1049120	1051720	But the periodic table is fantastic.
1051720	1055080	And it's not fantastic because of the data that is inside it.
1055080	1060440	It is fantastic because the table is an organizing principle.
1060440	1064640	If you have a box on the table, you know there's an atomic number, there's some number of protons,
1064640	1067960	some number of neutrons, da, da, da, da.
1067960	1070960	You know if there's something missing.
1070960	1078920	And this is a mathematical picture of what we call the standard model of particle physics.
1078920	1085000	The periodic table is beautiful because as physicists we understand that the periodic
1085000	1090760	table reflects a deep mathematical organizing principle and that is quantum mechanics applied
1090760	1092560	to atoms.
1092560	1097640	So this is what third and fourth year physics students do in the quantum mechanics courses.
1097640	1103560	And this thing, this mess of a table is beautiful not because they're these weird funny symbols
1103560	1111000	and they look kind of alien, but because this also reflects an organizing principle.
1111000	1114480	And this organizing principle lives within a generalization of quantum mechanics called
1114480	1117520	quantum field theory.
1117520	1122480	And what this table is, each row is a class of particle or a quantum field if you want
1122480	1124880	to be fancy.
1124880	1127040	These are their funny names.
1127040	1131380	Each row, one half means these are matter particles.
1131380	1136060	If it's not one half, it's a force particle, we'll get to the H in a bit.
1136060	1140460	And each of these columns is one of the three fundamental forces of particle physics, so
1140460	1142420	gravity is not included here.
1142420	1148220	And each of these funny symbols is a mathematical description of how those particles interact
1148220	1151540	under these fundamental forces.
1151540	1155300	So if you have new particles, the new particles should have something called spin which tells
1155300	1161020	if it's matter or a force particle and some numbers over here or some symbols over here.
1161020	1167020	And the one thing that was missing from the standard model of the 1970s was something
1167020	1169460	related to the Higgs boson.
1169460	1174580	It was this question that if we didn't have this last row, something funny happened to
1174580	1181820	our equations when we calculated the likelihood for two particles to smash together.
1181820	1187100	And the mathematics were giving us weird numbers like infinity, if that's even a number, any
1187100	1191500	mathematicians.
1191500	1196180	And the simplest explanation for why this theory would make sense is that there is one
1196180	1202460	more line here, the Higgs boson, that had particular properties and if you turn the
1202460	1207580	crank, everything made sense.
1207580	1209180	Everything except for one thing.
1209180	1212340	So we had a great idea of finding the Higgs boson.
1212340	1217620	If the Higgs boson actually exists, most of you know the answer, if the Higgs boson
1217620	1221940	actually exists, there was one additional puzzle.
1221940	1223260	Why is it so light?
1223260	1229940	We now know that the Higgs boson weighs about 125 times the mass of a proton.
1229940	1234180	If you turn the crank in this theory, you would expect it to be much heavier.
1234180	1237540	So this is give and take that didn't quite make sense.
1237540	1243500	And so if you zoom back to the 1990s and you went to the particle physics floor, not
1243500	1247940	the astronomy floor, they had two choices.
1247940	1252620	One choice was this puzzle of why is the Higgs boson light?
1252620	1258940	This was a puzzle that their community had built up to over 40 years of colliding particles
1258940	1262660	and building mathematical models, learning what all these weird symbols and tables meant,
1262660	1266580	and oh yeah, this is an open question.
1266580	1272420	And then there was this puzzle that our friends downstairs, our friends with these funny telescopes
1272420	1276260	and they go out at night, they're kind of like vampires, and they kept telling us this
1276260	1283860	weird thing about this missing matter, okay, which one are you going to work on?
1283860	1287620	The one where there were faculty who will hire you as a postdoc.
1287620	1290820	So this was the most important question.
1290820	1297060	And now I'm going to lead us down to the story of an opinionated, mostly correct story of
1297060	1301540	the weakly interacting massive particle, the wimp.
1301540	1306260	And this dominated our idea of what dark matter ought to be, and as a scientist you'd be really
1306260	1312740	careful when you say nature ought to be something for about 30 years.
1312740	1316300	And here's how it works.
1316300	1319660	So you have this big problem, this big deep problem.
1319660	1321140	Why is the Higgs boson light?
1321140	1324100	You do the calculations, it doesn't seem to make sense.
1324100	1330260	But you realize that there's a way to explain why the Higgs boson would be light, and that's
1330260	1336860	to invoke some deep, elegant mathematical principle that would explain why the theory is actually
1336860	1340620	more constrained.
1340620	1347180	Here is one such deep, elegant mathematical principle, it's called supersymmetry.
1347180	1352940	Symmetry is some deep, elegant mathematical relation between force particles and matter
1352940	1353940	particles.
1353940	1354940	And they all have silly names.
1354940	1360740	If an electron is a matter particle, there's a silly force particle, they say electron.
1360740	1363220	You have to get your kick somewhere.
1363220	1364620	So what?
1364620	1373260	So this ends up solving this puzzle that we had found.
1373260	1377060	Symmetry, because every particle has a copy, gives you new particles.
1377060	1380220	This theory predicts new particles.
1380220	1385660	So lesson number one, moe particles, moe problems.
1385660	1388460	I want this all to be on board with that.
1388460	1389460	So what happened?
1389460	1392820	Oh, this theory has more particles.
1392820	1394140	So what?
1394140	1398100	It turns out, the moment you put these new particles in, and you knew exactly what they
1398100	1406660	were, because for every proton, there's a super proton, all this stuff, protons suddenly
1406660	1410300	have new reactions where they can decay.
1410300	1415700	Well, that seems kind of dangerous.
1415700	1419780	You're here, I'm here, our protons are still around.
1419780	1423580	And in fact, for the physics students in the room, the bound on the lifetime of the proton
1423580	1427180	is actually longer than the age of the universe.
1427180	1430860	So you should think about, how do we have a bound that is longer than the age of space
1430860	1433100	time itself?
1433100	1438940	But protons are pretty darn stable, so that's not a good feature.
1438940	1444540	But we're thinking, you know, this is some weird practical problem, and this is this elegant,
1444540	1449900	deep mathematical thing was so beautiful, let's try to save it.
1449900	1456940	And what we do is we put a bandaid, a mathematical bandaid, and we invent some additional symmetry.
1457060	1463060	It's not deep, not elegant, but we just say, maybe there's some rule that prohibits these
1463060	1466700	interactions, and it has this silly name, r-parity.
1466700	1471460	And I will bet you nobody in this entire institute knows what the r means in r-parity.
1471460	1474700	I don't know.
1474700	1480180	But what this r-parity does, mathematically, you apply r-parity, and that means that the
1480180	1486420	interactions that would have caused the protons to decay are no longer allowed.
1486420	1489180	And it looks like everything starts to work again.
1489180	1494220	You solve your deep elegant problem, and the immediate other problem that comes up seems
1494220	1497780	to be okay, and you start feeling pretty good.
1497780	1501220	You bring your team of graduate students, and you look at this, and you say, hey, what
1501220	1503420	else does this theory do for us?
1503420	1512460	Well, with all of these new particles, and some reason, some parity, it turns out the
1512460	1516620	lightest new particle is stable.
1516620	1522540	So the reason why electrons don't decay into neutrinos, which are these other funny particles,
1522540	1525980	is because electrons are the lightest particle that carry electric charge.
1525980	1530540	There's no way to conserve charge if that electron decayed.
1530540	1539140	So the lightest new particle which carries r-charge is stable, cosmologically stable.
1539140	1544380	And it is at this point that we think, hey, you know, I heard something about cosmologically
1544380	1545700	stable new particles.
1545700	1550260	Oh, it was our friends downstairs, as we go down the stairs, and they say, what do you
1550260	1552220	know about dark matter?
1552220	1557540	And the one thing that we knew about dark matter is roughly how much there is.
1557540	1560620	So there's a calculation to be done, and it's a good thing, because there's a grad
1560620	1564100	student now in the room who says, hey, you know what you should do?
1564100	1566940	Do this calculation.
1566940	1572100	And let's be very honest, the first thing the grad student does is, nah, that calculation
1572100	1573100	is hard.
1573100	1574900	And it is hard.
1574900	1581100	It's hard because this calculation is telling you how much dark matter is left over after
1581100	1582780	the Big Bang.
1582780	1587060	So on the one side of the calculation, you're doing this particle physics calculation, something
1587060	1592780	about quantum mechanics and reaction rates for producing dark matter and dark matter annihilating.
1592820	1599180	On the other side of this calculation is something about the expansion of the universe to figure
1599180	1601260	out how much dark matter is left over.
1601260	1605420	So you have gravity, you know, G-Newton is in there, and on the other side, you have
1605420	1609740	all these particle physics numbers, and the grad student says, you're telling me that
1609740	1613580	you want me to do this really hard calculation.
1613580	1617900	Learn all this general relativity, and you expect me to match this arbitrary number from
1617900	1621420	these people downstairs who I've never met in my entire three years as a grad student.
1622420	1625940	And you say, yeah, it's for your thesis.
1625940	1633140	And wouldn't you know, wouldn't you know that the number that comes out is the correct number?
1635860	1637540	No, OK, that's a lie.
1637540	1640580	But it was a correct number within a couple of orders of magnitude.
1643780	1647660	I need astronomers, at least one astronomer in the front row.
1647660	1651740	But if you're a particle physicist sitting on the fifth floor and the astronomer's on
1651740	1656060	the fourth floor, you think, two orders of magnitude, that's amazing for astronomy.
1656060	1657900	You're dead on.
1657900	1660660	So we write papers and we celebrate.
1660660	1664100	OK, you wake up the next morning feeling pretty good about yourself.
1667260	1669820	And then someone knocks on your door.
1669820	1670900	Who's here at 9 a.m.?
1670900	1672020	You open up the door.
1672020	1677540	Professor, that was a fantastic series of paper you wrote about super symmetry and
1677540	1678980	dark matter.
1678980	1680580	I'm your new grad student.
1680580	1682660	What are we going to work on now?
1682660	1687380	And you think, oh, gosh, I don't remember that I hired a grad student.
1687380	1691660	Well, there is one game that I know how to play.
1691660	1694660	And it's this puzzle of why is the Higgs light?
1694660	1696020	Oh, maybe we got it wrong last time.
1696020	1698860	OK, let's try alternatives.
1698860	1704500	Let's look for some other deep, elegant, mathematical explanation for why the Higgs
1704500	1705500	mass should be light.
1705540	1710900	And it turns out one such deep, elegant, mathematical solution is to extend space
1710900	1713580	time, have an extra dimension.
1713580	1716100	Totally weird.
1716100	1718180	Turns out it can kind of work.
1718180	1721220	Well, if you have an extra dimension, what do you get?
1721220	1726180	Like higher modes in the violin string, like higher octaves, these extra dimensions
1726180	1729620	predict new particles.
1729620	1730620	Huh, OK.
1730620	1733420	And what happens when you have new particles?
1733460	1736860	Mo particles, mo problems.
1736860	1740940	Turns out these new particles, when you put them into your theory, screw up all sorts
1740940	1746060	of weird observations that we found over the past 30 years.
1746060	1746820	So that can't be right.
1746820	1749980	It's not quite proton decay, but related to proton decay.
1749980	1753540	And there are weird different flavors of extra dimensions.
1753540	1755620	And so the grad student starts to slump.
1755620	1757260	We say, it's OK.
1757260	1759900	We've done this before.
1759900	1763220	So you invent a humbler new symmetry.
1763220	1765460	It's a band-aid, mathematical band-aid.
1765460	1767740	It's called collusive client parity.
1767740	1772380	What that means is some of these new particles are prohibited from interacting
1772380	1778260	in certain ways, and it ends up curing these observables, just like preventing
1778260	1780860	the proton from decaying.
1780860	1782420	And the grad student says, oh, good.
1782420	1783620	What else happens?
1783620	1787980	Well, once you have a new symmetry and some conserved charge, the lightest new
1787980	1791620	particle is stable, cosmologically stable.
1793260	1794420	And the grad student says, OK.
1794420	1800980	And then, well, what I would like you to do is to read your predecessor's thesis
1800980	1805980	and learn how to do the calculation where this new light particle, this lightest
1805980	1813460	particle with KK charge, how much of it is left over in the universe?
1813460	1817340	And the grad student says, OK, well, I can read the previous student's thesis,
1817340	1820380	but that was like a shot in the dark that it worked out.
1820380	1821100	How do you expect?
1821100	1822780	And you said, just do it.
1824220	1828860	And while the grad student is going through this calculation, you look at this chart
1828860	1834300	and you realize the new particles that you get, you know a lot about these new
1834300	1835060	particles.
1835060	1840700	You know a lot about them because they inherit their properties from the Higgs
1840700	1842180	and all of the Higgs' cousins.
1842180	1843300	Why?
1843300	1846020	Because there is this deep, elegant mathematical symmetry.
1846020	1846900	It's like a mirror.
1846900	1851540	The thing on the other side of the mirror, you know what that person looks like.
1851540	1855900	And so when the grad student comes back and says, would you believe?
1855900	1858540	You'd say, yeah, it probably works out, doesn't it?
1858540	1860700	And you're starting to realize it's not a coincidence.
1860700	1865940	The details of the calculation change, but the numbers that go in are all basically
1865940	1868700	the same scale numbers.
1868700	1875100	The grad student goes off to celebrate and you buy a bottle of champagne for their dissertation.
1875100	1876980	Next morning.
1876980	1881420	Professor, oh my gosh, I love the series of papers that you're doing.
1881460	1882780	What's my first project?
1882780	1884020	I'm your brand new grad student.
1884020	1888300	And you think, holy moly, this large electron collider has better turn on soon
1888300	1890140	because I am running dry.
1890140	1892580	But you think, well, why is the Higgs light?
1892580	1893700	Let's think of a new ring.
1893700	1895740	Maybe there's substructure.
1895740	1899500	Maybe the Higgs is not a fundamental particle, but there are some, you know,
1899500	1902980	sub protons and sub neutrons that come together to form the Higgs.
1902980	1903340	Oh, OK.
1903340	1904660	So what does that mean?
1904660	1908300	Well, if you have like sub protons and sub neutrons and you have some other particles.
1908300	1909620	Great.
1909620	1910260	Is that OK?
1910260	1913700	No, probably not because you have all these observables that we have seen.
1913700	1916180	And these new particles screw it all up.
1916180	1917100	Oh, should I be said?
1917100	1918860	It's OK.
1918860	1920580	We can apply a bandaid.
1920580	1922180	This one's called T-parity.
1922180	1923380	I'm pretty sure.
1923380	1925980	Actually, people at Perimeter might know what T means.
1925980	1928500	And I should ask.
1928500	1929420	What does it do?
1929420	1931260	Well, it solves this problem.
1931260	1935220	And it means that the lightest new particle is cosmologically stable.
1935220	1938500	And then you tell the grad student, go and do the calculation.
1938500	1940900	I'm pretty sure it's going to work out.
1940900	1942300	It almost has to.
1942300	1946140	The details of this calculation, even though it's on the one side,
1946140	1947220	it's all particle physics.
1947220	1950140	On the other side, it's all general relativity.
1950140	1953980	The fact that they're all the same essential properties,
1953980	1956940	the same essential mass scales, the same essential fundamental
1956940	1960260	couplings, even though the details change,
1960260	1962380	if they're within a couple of orders of magnitude,
1962380	1964700	it's going to land in that window.
1964700	1967380	And it does.
1967420	1972940	And as a discipline, you are feeling pretty darn good.
1972940	1976580	Not only was there this puzzle where you needed a Higgs boson.
1976580	1978140	OK, we predict the Higgs boson.
1978140	1981660	But then you anticipated another problem.
1981660	1984620	And you came up with this deep, elegant mathematical solution,
1984620	1986740	not just one, but three.
1986740	1987660	It's got to be one of them.
1987660	1990700	And each one of those predicts new particles that
1990700	1993700	solves the downstairs people's problems.
1993700	1995340	Not only are we doing great in our field,
1995340	1996700	we're solving astronomy's problems.
1996700	1999220	Good for us.
1999220	2001140	Oh, boy.
2001140	2002820	It's a no-lose scenario.
2002820	2006100	You tell your colleagues, we have to build a collider.
2006100	2007540	We have to look for the Higgs.
2007540	2009300	And then we will learn truth.
2009300	2011180	There's something to see.
2011180	2013420	If you didn't find the Higgs, that's even better.
2013420	2016100	It's a bigger mystery.
2016100	2021060	So circa 1990s, this is what the standard model of particle
2021060	2024540	physics looked like to a theoretical particle
2024540	2027140	physicist.
2027140	2029180	And this is what experimental particle
2029180	2032460	physicists looked like to a theoretical particle
2032460	2035780	physicist, which, of course, I'm joking.
2035780	2038100	This is how progress happens.
2038100	2042100	And the key point is, when you have this no-lose theorem,
2042100	2044140	that there is a deep, meaningful reason
2044140	2046260	to build this collider, because whatever comes out,
2046260	2047820	you will learn truth.
2047820	2053220	You very quickly go from this to this.
2053220	2056140	And then even faster than it took to build this,
2056140	2060620	you go from this to this.
2060620	2063820	So how many people here remember the Nobel Prize
2063820	2066820	for the Higgs boson, 2013?
2066820	2067700	Very good.
2067700	2070900	And then remember the Nobel Prize for the discovery
2070900	2071860	of supersymmetry.
2074860	2075860	That's right.
2075860	2080620	The Nobel Prize for the discovery of extra dimensions
2080620	2084740	of the compositeness of the no.
2084740	2087820	So something went tremendously right.
2087820	2089900	There was a Higgs boson.
2089900	2093420	But something went tremendously wrong.
2093420	2097300	So 2013 also happened to be the year
2097300	2099900	that I defended my thesis.
2099900	2103460	It was a thesis you probably have heard of the chapters.
2103460	2105620	Chapter one was supersymmetry.
2105620	2107620	Chapter two was extra dimensions.
2107620	2110700	And chapter three was the compositeness of the Higgs.
2110700	2112740	And all of the great new things we
2112740	2115180	would discover at the Large Hadron Collider.
2118300	2120980	I don't know how it happened, but by some happenstance,
2120980	2124900	someone put me in contact with science news.
2124900	2128700	And the next thing I knew, I was literally the poster child
2128700	2135300	for a particular type of ennui among particle theory
2135300	2139540	graduate students who are graduating right around this time.
2139540	2140940	And it was so great.
2140940	2143460	It was a perfect love story.
2143460	2145540	You solve this problem in particle physics,
2145540	2150980	and for free, you predict the solution to this other problem.
2150980	2155100	And what this meant was that maybe the love story
2155100	2157140	has a breakup.
2157140	2163260	And like your first love, when it ends,
2163260	2165820	you get a little bit gothy.
2165820	2167140	And that's when I said, you know what?
2167140	2169300	I'm done with the Higgs boson.
2169300	2173220	I am now a dark matter theorist.
2173220	2174580	And there was some reason to this.
2174580	2177180	There's this idea that there is still an open problem
2177180	2179860	and a toolkit for building theories that
2179860	2185780	had not been fully utilized directly for this problem.
2185780	2188100	How do people feel right now?
2188100	2190220	I know my own emotional feelings about this.
2190220	2191660	It takes some time to get over it.
2191660	2195100	But it's a little bit of a downer.
2195100	2196460	So let's move on to where.
2196460	2198860	And here is where there's a little bit of hope.
2198860	2201380	Because even though this fantastic program of the weakly
2201380	2203300	interacting massive particle, the supersymmetry
2203300	2205220	actually dimensions, composite Higgs,
2205220	2207540	even though all of that didn't quite pan out
2207540	2211740	as well as we had hoped, it worked great for Higgs,
2211740	2216300	we still have the large hadron collider, which
2216300	2219300	probes smaller length scales than ever before probable
2219300	2221060	by the human race.
2221100	2226780	This is humanity's best microscope ever built.
2226780	2232140	We still have labs like Snow Lab, about 400 kilometers
2232140	2235980	north of here, where we have the most pristine environments
2235980	2238940	to look for the chance interactions of dark matter
2238940	2242820	scattering off of a nucleus, some of the most pristine
2242820	2247780	environments, again, literally ever made by humanity.
2247780	2252620	We still have an upcoming program of telescopes
2252620	2256780	to search with higher and higher resolution for this light
2256780	2259100	from 13 billion years ago.
2259100	2263140	And this is a site in Chile in the Atacama Desert.
2263140	2266260	And completely unexpected, we now
2266260	2270700	have gravitational waves, which are literally
2270700	2273700	a brand new way and qualitatively different way
2273700	2277660	of seeing the universe through radiation of space
2277660	2278660	and time itself.
2282260	2285780	We are equipped to make progress on this problem.
2285780	2287620	And so for all that I will apologize,
2287620	2290580	and you know what, maybe the 1990s and 2000s,
2290580	2293420	we were thinking in the wrong direction.
2293420	2296900	This program, some of its serendipitous,
2296900	2299340	is well suited where we have a fighting chance
2299340	2302980	to make deep progress on this question.
2302980	2305740	So for the past two years, the North American particle
2305740	2308380	physics community goes through this decadal process
2308380	2310340	where we review one of our priorities,
2310340	2312060	our scientific priorities, in our field
2312060	2313420	of fundamental physics.
2313420	2315500	And it should not surprise you that one
2315500	2317900	of the unifying themes was to understand,
2317900	2321580	what is dark matter?
2321580	2324060	All right.
2324060	2325740	So that says something about particle physics.
2325740	2328700	That says something about where the field is.
2328700	2332140	I am a theoretical particle physicist.
2332140	2336340	How is it that I search for dark matter?
2336340	2339020	All right, so I have a quiz.
2339020	2341700	This depends on whether or not you're wearing glasses.
2341700	2345180	What is the difference between these two pictures?
2345180	2347340	Anybody?
2347340	2347940	Good.
2347940	2351420	So one of these is the Millennium Falcon.
2351420	2354140	I think this is a screenshot from one of the movies.
2354140	2356900	Let me say this is the Millennium Falcon.
2356900	2361780	The other is a Lego model of the Millennium Falcon.
2361820	2363100	And there's something very deep here
2363100	2367140	that I think rings true to any physicist.
2367140	2370820	The model is an approximation for the actual thing.
2374660	2376580	If you zoom into the model, if you lift it up,
2376580	2377900	if you look around, if you pick it up,
2377900	2380340	you say, hey, this thing is kind of small to be the Millennium
2380340	2382300	Falcon.
2382300	2385420	But in the right context, you learn something
2385420	2386420	about the Millennium Falcon.
2386420	2390580	You learn, oh, maybe this little deflector dish, which
2390580	2391740	fell off in one of the movies.
2391740	2393580	It's roughly the same size as this bit over here.
2393580	2397700	There are things you can learn from a model.
2397700	2399820	But the model is not nature.
2399820	2401940	The fact that you have a mathematical model
2401940	2406060	does not prescribe what ought to happen in nature.
2406060	2407140	And this is where we are.
2407140	2409740	So when you ask, what is it that theoretical physicists do?
2409740	2412780	There's a misconception that we tell you what nature is.
2412780	2413500	We don't do that.
2413500	2414860	We cannot do that.
2414860	2416860	We build mathematical models, and here
2416860	2420220	is the model that we introduced earlier, the standard model,
2420220	2422500	to describe nature and to mock up nature
2422500	2425980	and maybe glean some principles that nature realizes,
2425980	2427860	but that is not a prescription.
2427860	2430700	So there is this great painting.
2430700	2432460	It says, this is not a pipe.
2432460	2436140	I will spare the Quebecois, my attempted French.
2436140	2439020	But when we do theoretical physics,
2439020	2441420	we are exploring what types of models
2441420	2443460	can explain the dark matter puzzle
2443460	2446940	and what can we learn from those mathematical models.
2446940	2450380	And like any good crime procedural,
2450380	2452980	there is a motive, means, and opportunity.
2452980	2456260	A mathematical model for dark matter
2456260	2458340	answers these questions.
2458340	2460860	First one is, what is it?
2460860	2464460	Some super symmetric partner, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2464460	2466820	The next thing is, how did it get here?
2466820	2471340	You have to explain what mechanism created this particle.
2471340	2473860	Then most of the particles that we know of
2473860	2475540	are actually unstable.
2475540	2479620	You have to explain, why is that particle still around?
2479620	2481580	And given that we've been searching for dark matter
2481580	2483780	for 30 years, then your theory has
2483780	2487020	to say why we haven't found it yet.
2487020	2491820	And any theory worth its weight will tell you,
2491820	2495300	and this is how you will discover this type of particle.
2495300	2497940	It'll give you something falsifiable.
2497940	2500780	And so for the weekly interacting massive particle,
2500780	2503100	there is some deep, elegant mathematical symmetry
2503100	2505460	that explains to you what this new particle is.
2505460	2508900	And that was very deep, and exciting, and meaningful.
2508900	2511060	Then there's a series of answers.
2511060	2512140	How did it get here?
2512140	2514140	Well, the same way that ordinary particles got here
2514140	2515460	through something called thermal freeze out,
2515460	2517460	that was the calculation that we asked the grad student
2517460	2520580	to do over and over and over again.
2520580	2521500	Why is it still here?
2521500	2522740	We have to put that band-aid on.
2522740	2524100	Remember, if you put this band-aid on,
2524100	2528540	you solve some problems, and for free you get stable particles.
2528540	2529860	Why isn't it ruled out?
2529860	2535340	Well, for all we know, dark matter might still be a wimp.
2535340	2536700	How do we discover it?
2536700	2539220	For the wimp, we keep doing exactly what we are doing,
2539220	2541780	because we have the experimental program to probe this.
2545940	2548860	But there are other answers to these questions.
2548860	2552300	Maybe it's less interesting what the deep mathematical
2552300	2554380	principle is before.
2554380	2556980	Maybe we start with, there is dark matter.
2556980	2560300	Let's build the simplest building blocks, the simplest
2560300	2562460	LEGO model, the simplest mathematical model,
2562460	2564260	and see what comes out.
2564260	2566140	And then, how do you discover it?
2566140	2568060	You start thinking more creatively.
2568060	2570020	If there are different answers to how to get here,
2570020	2571580	you have different interactions, which
2571580	2573180	means there are different reasons why it's stable,
2573180	2575940	and you have different ways in which it'll manifest itself.
2575940	2577220	And one of the really great things
2577220	2579020	we've been talking about over the past three days here
2579020	2582900	at Perimeter is one puzzle that I'll shout out, which
2582900	2586260	is there are a handful of black holes.
2586260	2588820	So this is a quasar with an artist's rendition.
2588820	2589940	There's a handful of these.
2589940	2593620	So our galaxy is far, far away that
2593620	2596940	are powered by a supermassive black hole.
2596940	2598580	And what's the difference between a black hole
2598580	2600100	and a supermassive black hole?
2600100	2602260	The supermassive black hole is so large
2602260	2605300	that our understanding of how black holes form
2605300	2609780	cannot explain how they got so down large.
2609780	2614620	And the usual story is that first you form stars,
2614620	2615980	and stars form little black holes.
2615980	2618020	Little black holes combine to form big black holes.
2618020	2619500	But that cannot happen fast enough
2619500	2621900	to explain these gigantic black holes.
2621900	2624380	And one of the really cool things that we've been doing,
2624380	2626980	this is a photo taken earlier today,
2626980	2629740	has been puzzling over the ways in which the dark matter, which
2629740	2631740	we know was already in these galaxies,
2631740	2634380	because they held the galaxy together,
2634380	2636940	might be contributing to answering this puzzle.
2636940	2639220	And how this puzzle might be the first step
2639220	2643180	in this refined way of looking at this open question of learning
2643180	2644500	something new about dark matter.
2644500	2647700	All right.
2647700	2650380	So this is just a slice of the type of really exciting types
2650380	2653580	of questions that we've been thinking about.
2653580	2656900	Now, I want to change gears here and answer the who.
2656900	2659140	So who gets to do this thing?
2659140	2664380	Who gets the privilege of exploring the cosmos
2664380	2667380	using theoretical physics?
2667380	2670820	And there's an analogy that we often use.
2670820	2671940	Dark matter is in dark.
2671940	2674020	It's invisible.
2674020	2676900	And the analogy has to do with equity and diversity
2676900	2679100	in physics.
2679100	2681420	It's probably not surprising that such an analogy would
2681420	2682060	come about.
2682060	2684740	There are a few different analogies.
2684740	2686500	And in the same way that dark matter
2686500	2689940	is a puzzle of missing mass, mass that we don't understand
2689940	2691540	what it is or where it came from,
2691540	2693380	there's just missing talent puzzle.
2693380	2697220	Oftentimes, when you walk into a room in a physics department,
2697220	2700420	the people that you see there have a different demographic
2700420	2705340	makeup than the people that you see outside the university.
2705340	2708660	And the analogy here is, why is it
2708660	2711020	that we've discovered all this stuff about atoms?
2711020	2712820	Like, we know all sorts about chemistry.
2712820	2714340	We know about biology.
2714340	2718860	It's because ordinary matter, protons, electrons, neutrons,
2718860	2721940	and trinos, well, not neutrinos, are charged
2721940	2723420	under electromagnetism.
2723420	2726340	That is the probe that we use to see, smell, taste, hear
2726340	2728780	everything about matter.
2728780	2730900	Dark matter does not seem to have
2730900	2732740	that privilege of being charged.
2732740	2735700	That means our telescopes, our microscopes, all our tools
2735700	2737860	do not automatically work the way
2737860	2739580	that they do for ordinary matter.
2739580	2741580	That doesn't mean that dark matter doesn't exist.
2741580	2744620	That does not mean that the talent doesn't exist.
2744620	2747300	And there's a lot of fantastic books writing about what this is.
2747300	2749660	These are people who are far ahead of their journey
2749660	2751220	in thinking about this puzzle than I am.
2751220	2755020	And I encourage you to take a look if you're interested.
2755020	2757260	But another way in which this is analogous to the puzzle
2757300	2762380	of dark matter is that this is not a puzzle of missing data.
2762380	2765940	Just like Katie's slide, we have many, many reasons
2765940	2768500	to believe that there is a missing mass problem.
2768500	2770700	And there is no shortage of data that
2770700	2772860	across different types of demographic slices,
2772860	2776340	whether it's gender or ethnicity or unseen things
2776340	2780220	like socioeconomic background, belief, political background,
2780220	2783780	all of these things, the demographic inside the ivory
2783780	2787660	tower is different from the demographic outside.
2787660	2789900	So it's not a matter of missing data
2789900	2794140	or orders of magnitude in astronomical observations.
2794140	2797700	Like the puzzle of dark matter, maybe the way
2797700	2802180	that we have been doing things might not be the best way.
2802180	2804780	Maybe there should be new approaches
2804780	2807700	and new theoretical instructions, new frameworks
2807700	2810980	to approach this puzzle.
2811020	2813940	And when we think about this, there's
2813940	2818220	something that oftentimes well-meaning people will say
2818220	2820540	in earnestness.
2820540	2823300	Well, but physics doesn't care about the color of your skin
2823300	2824420	or your race or your gender.
2824420	2826340	Maxwell's equations are indifferent to the human
2826340	2828540	who is creating them, right?
2828540	2830700	It's a reasonable thing to say.
2830700	2833580	But oftentimes, the people who say this at one stage
2833580	2835860	of their career go on.
2835860	2837980	And then there's inevitably some road bump,
2837980	2839500	because we all hit road bumps.
2839620	2841620	And then there are different things that are said.
2841620	2844180	Oh, well, the committee would have selected me
2844180	2847940	if only I had this fancier university on my diploma,
2847940	2851780	if only I had this fancier knickknack on my CV.
2851780	2855860	Or if only I had advanced calculus when I was in high school,
2855860	2859740	I'd be able to do research when I was my first year of college.
2859740	2862780	Or when one's hand is the only brown hand in the classroom,
2862780	2864460	maybe it's a little bit harder to be the one
2864460	2866660	to ask a question.
2866660	2869620	And I mention these because these
2869620	2874780	are sociological human issues, even though the subject itself
2874780	2877220	is indifferent to the humanity.
2877220	2883900	And to be able to do this, this is a human endeavor.
2887180	2890860	I argue, though, this is still the wrong way
2890860	2893340	of thinking about it.
2893340	2895220	So how many people here saw Oppenheimer?
2897620	2901100	That's a smaller percentage than I expected.
2901100	2904940	So one of the characters in Oppenheimer is Vannevar Bush.
2904940	2906460	This is his character over here.
2906460	2907940	And for those of you who saw the movie,
2907940	2910820	the person he's shaking hands with is the villain.
2910820	2913740	But Vannevar Bush was the architect
2913740	2917540	of what is now known as the National Science Foundation.
2917540	2922180	And this is the report written during wartime
2922220	2925460	where Vannevar Bush advocated for the US
2925460	2930660	to form a funding body to support not applied research, not
2930660	2933620	military research, but research in fundamental science.
2936100	2939580	I will say that the National Science Foundation
2939580	2944460	and its cousin in Canada, NSERC, have been perhaps
2944460	2948340	the greatest forces in fundamental science
2948340	2950540	in the history of mankind.
2950540	2955140	And I do not mean that, ironically, this is true.
2955140	2958340	The commitment to fundamental research
2958340	2961860	that these institutions have put forward.
2961860	2963820	I would say that even if I were not currently
2963820	2965700	funded by the National Science Foundation,
2965700	2968740	but I feel like I should mention that.
2968740	2970300	But this is true.
2970300	2971940	And this report is online.
2971940	2975300	If you look into this report, there
2975300	2979500	is this phrase by a chemist, James Conant,
2979500	2983140	in every section of the entire area of the word,
2983140	2988340	every section where the word science may be applied,
2988340	2993420	the limiting factor is human.
2993420	2995940	The limiting factor is human.
2995940	2999260	And so here is the version from Perimeter Institute.
2999260	3001540	Rob Myers, the director of Perimeter Institute.
3001540	3003980	We can't afford to leave any great thinkers
3003980	3006540	or any great ideas behind.
3006540	3009460	The limiting factor is human.
3009460	3011980	So you might have the best microscope
3011980	3013500	humanity has ever built.
3013500	3015620	You might have the most pristine environments
3015620	3018060	to look for dark matter scattering off a nuclei.
3018060	3020740	You might have the ability to see with finer resolution
3020740	3023380	than ever before the first light of the universe.
3023380	3025940	And you might have a damn new way of seeing the universe
3025940	3028020	itself.
3028020	3033100	But the thing that is holding us back is human.
3033100	3035260	This is the value of places like Perimeter.
3035260	3036980	This is where the progress is.
3037020	3040380	And if you ask purely about scientific interest,
3040380	3042180	you're saying nothing about fairness or equity
3042180	3044180	or any of these things.
3044180	3049220	When you want to draw people to this column,
3049220	3052740	you want the people who will sacrifice and work hard
3052740	3053980	and who are willing to do this.
3053980	3057540	This is a hard job and it's difficult work, tough problems.
3057540	3062660	You want to be able to draw from not just the 15%,
3062660	3066780	you want that entire 100%.
3066940	3069620	The power of full participation is analogous
3069620	3070460	to the standard model.
3070460	3072340	The standard model does a lot of great things.
3072340	3074180	Chemistry is because of the standard model of particle
3074180	3075700	physics.
3075700	3077780	But dark matter creates galaxies.
3080460	3085260	So let's do one last question.
3085260	3088900	That's how we do it, who does it, who gets to do it.
3088900	3091020	Why do we do this?
3091020	3093220	And whenever I think about this, there's
3093220	3094340	a painting by Paul Gauguin.
3094340	3095780	Who are we, where do we come from,
3095820	3097420	where are we going in some order?
3097420	3100940	And I think about this, why do we do science?
3100940	3102660	I think about this painting because it reminds me
3102660	3107100	that every culture for as long as humanity has been human
3107100	3111220	has had a story, has had a cosmology of how we belong,
3111220	3116300	how we came to be who we are, where we came from.
3116300	3118900	Right now, science is part of our cosmology
3118900	3122380	as a global human species.
3122380	3124740	And we have our own story.
3124740	3126180	And that story is something like this.
3128820	3131580	13 billion years ago-ish, there was something called
3131580	3132220	the Big Bang.
3132220	3134300	We don't quite understand what happened.
3134300	3136220	It's curious.
3136220	3138620	The Big Bang formed a lot of the matter and stuff
3138620	3140020	in our universe.
3140020	3142420	A good chunk of that stuff is dark matter, which you see here
3142420	3144060	in these weird filaments.
3144060	3146180	The universe expanded rapidly and cooled down,
3146180	3147660	and these filaments condensed.
3150660	3152100	Where these filaments overlap, there
3152100	3154420	is an over-density of gravity.
3154420	3157140	They started pulling in more dark matter.
3157140	3159860	That dark matter over-density then
3159860	3162740	had a bigger gravitational pull, and started pulling in
3162740	3165900	this really funny stuff called hydrogen gas.
3165900	3168700	And that hydrogen gas collected into this clump of dark matter,
3168700	3171380	and eventually the hydrogen gas found each other,
3171380	3174340	and they started forming these funny things called stars.
3174340	3176980	Some of those stars would go supernova and produce metals,
3176980	3179860	and you would form more complex stars.
3179860	3183620	Those would get together into things called galaxies.
3183620	3186140	In the galaxies, you find these little solar systems,
3186140	3191660	and the next thing you know, there's a planet called Earth,
3191660	3196860	and there are these people who are little goldfish, who
3196860	3200420	are just discovering the dark matter ocean that we happen
3200420	3201940	to be living in.
3201940	3204100	And that is why we do this.
3204100	3205140	So thank you very much.
3205140	3205640	Thank you.
3220520	3222220	Thank you so much.
3222220	3224540	All right, so we have time for questions.
3224540	3227220	So as I said before, there's a microphone there on the stairs.
3227220	3229620	So if you have a question, please make your way
3229620	3231820	to the microphone if you can.
3231820	3234820	I'm more from a philosophy background,
3234820	3237300	and I don't know if they like that question.
3237300	3241700	Have you heard of flies too young for the empiricism?
3241700	3242660	No, I'm not familiar with it.
3242660	3243660	Sorry.
3243660	3245060	Should you stand up for the microphone?
3245060	3246300	Here we have flies, which is called
3246300	3250100	the Undetermination of Theory by Experiment.
3250100	3252300	Ah, OK.
3252300	3253340	Do you want me to explain it?
3253340	3254340	Please.
3254340	3259500	The Hammers had a great influence on Einstein and Mark.
3259500	3268900	He wrote a book on the nature of physics in 1908, I believe.
3268900	3273100	And what he was claiming that every theory involves
3273100	3276100	theses that can never be reduced together.
3276100	3278300	So it kind of confirms what you're saying.
3278300	3282380	So let's say a theory how a telescope works
3282380	3284100	is part of your structure.
3284100	3288180	But the theory of light, of how that new telescope works,
3288180	3290220	you have to, is part of the theory.
3290220	3292820	So you can never go to a groundwork.
3292820	3296020	He actually criticized Carl Popper, who thought that everything
3296020	3298260	had to be verifiable.
3298260	3301140	And he said, no, he can never do that.
3301140	3303900	And he thought even basic ideas of physics,
3303900	3306660	like motion and stuff like that, we
3306660	3308740	also have to have a point of reference.
3308740	3310700	But everything in the universe is moving.
3310700	3313700	So how do you have a point of reference for all the motions
3313700	3314500	of the universe?
3314500	3316700	So that's the basic thesis.
3316700	3319100	So that's called the Dhamm-Quine thesis.
3319100	3321020	And it's one of the most important things
3321020	3322980	in 20th century philosophy.
3322980	3325380	And it's called Two Dogmas of Appearicism.
3325380	3328460	And what Quine was saying about the dogmas of empiricism
3328460	3330780	is that we have a way we, a plant had the idea
3330780	3333060	of the way we think of the world and the way the world is.
3333060	3335860	And he created this idea of the thing of itself.
3335860	3338180	And Quine attacks that idea and says
3338180	3339780	it's a false idea.
3339780	3343580	Because how we perceive things is then changed.
3343580	3345580	So the theory, we don't work that way.
3345580	3347660	And the things get actually mixed together.
3347660	3348820	So that's the basis thesis.
3348820	3349780	So you might want to look it up.
3349780	3353320	It's called Two Dogmas of Empiricism by Willard Van
3353320	3353820	Wook.
3353820	3356420	And it confirms exactly what you're saying in a certain way.
3356420	3359780	So yeah, I can offer.
3359780	3362020	I'm afraid of saying this in the wrong way.
3362020	3365180	My best friend that usually represents a philosopher.
3365180	3368380	And I'll say one short thing on that, which I thank you
3368380	3370300	very much for sharing that.
3370300	3372860	Part of what I wanted to share here
3372860	3376700	was the way in which my sub-tribe of particle theory
3376700	3377940	thinks about theories.
3377940	3379780	And what you're saying is exactly,
3379780	3383700	it is a philosophical question.
3383700	3386420	But thinking about capital T theory,
3386420	3390580	where this is some framework for everything.
3390580	3394220	And I think what's relevant here epistemologically
3394220	3397100	is that the theories that I'm talking about here
3397100	3398260	are lower case T theories.
3398260	3400460	And that's why I emphasize by the Lego analogy
3400460	3403420	that these are toys that are meant to do one thing.
3403420	3406580	And that's exactly what the answer is and why it's so low.
3406580	3410340	And actually, there's a philosopher of QT called
3410340	3412620	Basque-on-Frasen, and he said that as well.
3412620	3416260	So all three of you effectively agree on that theory.
3416260	3417180	Thank you for that.
3417180	3420340	Yeah, so we have some questions from the online audience.
3420340	3421980	And if you have questions in the audience,
3421980	3425700	please feel free to make your way to the microphone.
3425700	3427180	So let's see.
3427180	3431100	We have plenty of questions from online.
3431100	3432820	So here's a good one.
3432820	3436860	If we found Dark Matter, what other physics mysteries
3436860	3439940	would be easier to solve with that new information?
3439940	3441260	That is a really good question.
3441260	3445780	Thank you, person in the universe who asked this.
3445780	3448100	We have a list of puzzles.
3448100	3452700	And depending on what it is that we find, how we find it,
3452700	3455380	there are different ways of piecing that into these puzzles.
3455420	3457900	And so one way of playing this game that we play as particle
3457900	3461340	theorists is pick your favorite particle physics problem.
3461340	3463420	Why is there more antimatter than matter?
3463420	3466780	So why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe?
3466780	3470660	Why is it that certain particles have these weird properties?
3470660	3473100	Why is it that the Higgs boson is light?
3473100	3474660	That problem is still out there.
3474660	3477620	And then you play this game of there's
3477620	3479300	this new telescope coming online.
3479300	3481660	If that telescope has this new ability
3481660	3483220	to see the world in a certain way,
3483260	3488340	what implications does my proposed model, my toy theory,
3488340	3490580	imply for that telescope?
3490580	3493340	And so there's this whole, in fact, in our conference,
3493340	3497300	we had this fantastic figure, it was a flow chart of,
3497300	3500500	if you see this, then what do you think it could be
3500500	3503020	and what is the next experiment that you do to verify that?
3503020	3505620	But the question hits exactly at the heart of what
3505620	3506740	it is that we're doing.
3506740	3507700	That's great.
3507700	3509500	Go ahead.
3509500	3513420	Can you comment on the modified gravity theory
3513420	3519500	introduced by John Moffat that claims to explain cosmological
3519500	3521060	data without dark matter?
3521060	3522460	This is a fantastic question.
3522460	3523460	Thank you.
3523460	3527980	So modified gravity or cousins modified Newtonian dynamics,
3527980	3530580	this is an alternative to what I was saying where
3530580	3532900	let's all get on the same page in dark matters and new particles.
3532900	3534700	Thank you very much for pointing this out.
3534700	3538420	And so this is a different proposal.
3538420	3540660	People have different opinions about the viability
3540660	3546940	of these proposals, embedding into a full capital T theory.
3546940	3550740	But that's all human opinion.
3550740	3552340	We call it Bayesian priors.
3552340	3554260	What a good theory ought to look like.
3554260	3558100	What's really neat about modified gravity
3558100	3562540	is that it is a proposal that has value in the space
3562540	3563940	of understanding what dark matter is.
3563940	3565300	And I'll give you an example of this.
3565300	3567180	So even in my tribe, there's this idea
3567180	3569060	called self-interacting dark matter.
3569060	3570420	Dark matter isn't just inert.
3570420	3574260	Sometimes it bounces off of itself.
3574260	3576860	And what modified Newtonian dynamics tells you
3576860	3579300	is that maybe gravity behaves a little bit differently
3579300	3582100	on different scales.
3582100	3584580	One of my colleagues at UC Riverside, Hybo-U,
3584580	3588100	realized that, oh, that theory has some merit
3588100	3589220	in connecting to experiments.
3589220	3590940	That's really exciting.
3590940	3593740	I have my own pet theory if that dark matter will bounce off
3593740	3595740	of itself.
3595740	3598500	And if dark matter bounces off of itself,
3598500	3600860	the distribution of dark matter in these bubbles,
3600860	3603900	in these halos, would be different.
3603900	3604620	It'd be more puffy.
3604620	3606540	It's like a popcorn machine.
3606540	3608300	And if dark matter is more puffy,
3608300	3610900	that means the gravitational interaction,
3610900	3612420	the net gravitational interaction,
3612420	3614500	will be a little bit different.
3614500	3617900	And if it's different just the right way,
3617900	3622380	it can end up looking like modified Newtonian dynamics.
3622380	3624700	And say whichever tribe you follow,
3624700	3626540	and whatever you prefer as a human being,
3626540	3629980	experiments will figure things out ultimately.
3629980	3633460	But the fact that there's this idea
3633460	3636580	led to cross-pollination of new ideas and new observables.
3636580	3637740	And this is the key point.
3637740	3640060	What happened was the community was
3640060	3643900	able to say, we should look for this type of observables
3643900	3645380	in our new telescopes.
3645380	3647580	And that will teach us something.
3647580	3649940	And so I know a lot of the way people frame this
3649940	3652580	is as a debate between one camp versus another camp.
3652580	3653740	We're all on the same team trying
3653740	3654660	to discover truth here.
3654660	3656820	And I think that's a really fantastic example of that.
3660260	3661060	Hi, thanks a lot.
3661060	3662820	Hello, thank you.
3662820	3666220	Pretty simplistic question, I think.
3666220	3668900	My background on this is so elementary,
3668900	3671020	so please forgive the silliness of the question
3671020	3671980	if it comes off that way.
3671980	3673180	You know you start the question.
3673180	3674060	Now I'm terrified.
3674060	3676540	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3676540	3678900	The idea that dark matter, the candidate for dark matter
3678900	3681460	that you're discussing, is a massive particle.
3684100	3686300	The fact that there's like 85%, et cetera.
3686300	3689580	Like instead of it being a few massive particles,
3689580	3691700	what about a whole lot of really light particles?
3691700	3695660	And is that still in the running?
3695660	3696700	Very good.
3696700	3697940	That is not a simple question.
3697940	3700100	That is a deep and insightful question.
3700100	3702540	And that's a question that we ask ourselves over and over
3702540	3704340	again.
3704340	3707180	Good, the mass range for plausible dark matter candidates,
3707180	3708340	which again plausible is something
3708340	3712340	that human beings make up, is actually incredibly wide.
3712340	3716060	On the one end, you could have gigantic, 10 to the 30 solar
3716060	3717540	mass black holes.
3717540	3719380	On the other end, you could have things
3719380	3722020	which one would barely call a particle quantum
3722020	3724260	mechanically.
3724260	3726300	What I will offer here, instead of just saying,
3726300	3730140	could be anything, what I will offer here is, OK,
3730140	3731500	what do we know about dark matter?
3731500	3732860	The puzzle exists.
3732860	3737620	We also know roughly how much there is.
3737620	3739900	And there's one other thing I hadn't yet told you.
3739900	3741740	We also know, in fact, the way to say,
3741860	3743620	dark matter is cool.
3743620	3745420	And not just in the hip way, but it's
3745420	3747380	cool that it is cold.
3747380	3749180	It's non-relativistic.
3749180	3751420	Today, dark matter isn't traveling very fast.
3751420	3754100	And we know that because it had to form these bubbles,
3754100	3757380	these halos, that were needed to collect the hydrogen,
3757380	3759860	to form stars, to form everything.
3759860	3763740	So the limits on can dark matter be a bunch of light things
3763740	3766620	rather than a few heavy things is actually
3766620	3770060	set by, if they're very light, are they also moving very fast?
3770100	3772420	And if they're moving too fast, you can't do it.
3772420	3775060	So it's a very deep question.
3775060	3776980	And you actually have the exactly right intuition
3776980	3779420	that you can have a bunch of heavy things,
3779420	3781180	or a bunch of light things, which
3781180	3782740	would be equivalent gravitationally,
3782740	3783980	to a few heavy things.
3783980	3786340	So yeah, thank you.
3786340	3787540	All right.
3787540	3791020	Thank you so much to all of the folks who asked questions.
3791020	3792340	Thank you to our online audience.
3792340	3794700	And thank you so much to Professor Tenedo.
3794700	3795200	Thank you.
3795200	3795700	Thank you.
3795700	3796200	Thank you.
3825200	3827200	Thank you.
