00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,600
Hi Neil Turok, thank you so much for joining us on Conversations at the Perimeter.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,680
My pleasure.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,120
So I have to say I've always enjoyed when I've had the opportunity to talk to you over

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,840
the years and one thing that I find particularly impressive about your work is that you have

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,520
such a deep understanding of the big picture and the goals of fundamental physics.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,000
I think this is particularly difficult for researchers like me that can maybe get a bit

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
lost in technical difficulties and calculations.

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,560
So I want to start with a very big picture question.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,880
How would you describe the state of theoretical physics research today?

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,480
It's very interesting.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,840
It has grown into a very large field.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,800
There are tens of thousands of researchers around the world.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,720
At the same time I think it's diversified enormously.

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,720
The part of it which I'm most fascinated in is the fundamental understanding of the universe,

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,400
be it on very small scales as in particle physics or very large scales as in cosmology.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,280
And that part I would have to say has been on the one hand benefiting from incredible

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,640
observations.

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,240
On small scales we have the Large Hadron Collider, most powerful microscope ever built, showing

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
us what subatomic particles look like.

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,320
And on the large scales we have data showing us the whole visible universe with exquisite

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,440
precision.

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,040
So it's definitely been a golden age in that sense.

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,400
And on the more theoretical side, I'd say the picture is more mixed.

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,120
Since I started in theoretical physics in the early 80s, there have been great hopes

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,120
about a number of programs of research, grand unified theories, supersymmetric theories,

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,400
string theory, super gravity, M theory and so on.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,480
And I would have to say that these have not yet panned out.

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:41,280
It's very striking that there is not yet a single prediction which has been verified

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,360
from any of these frameworks.

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,960
So from my own point of view, on the one hand you can, you know, wring your hands and say,

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,640
why hasn't theory been more successful?

32
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,720
In the last 40 years, you know, all the theories we've verified are essentially rather old

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,360
theories, Einstein's theory of gravity, the Higgs theory of the Higgs boson and the standard

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,080
model have been verified with more and more precision.

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
But the newer ideas haven't panned out.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,040
So you can say, you know, feel rather upset and disappointed about that.

37
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
I don't.

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:31,320
I think what's happening is that nature is speaking to us and telling us that he or she

39
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,080
is simpler than we expected.

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,440
Because what these observations reveal is a striking minimalism.

41
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,560
You know, we don't find any more party.

42
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:52,480
We have not found any more particles in probing the universe at very high energies now at

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,840
the Large Hadron Collider.

44
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,440
And on large scales in the universe, the universe appears to be more or less as simple as it

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:08,040
possibly could be and still give rise to galaxies and stars and the structures we observe.

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:16,800
So this is tremendously exciting because I think the simplicity indicated by the observations

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,280
is, I believe, pointing us to new principles.

48
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:29,120
And those principles will be deep and universal and highly predictive and highly constraining.

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,600
And they will constrain the universe to look something like what we see.

50
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,000
So in, you know, whereas you might naively expect the universe to get more and more complicated

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,280
as you go to bigger scales, the opposite seems to be true.

52
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:55,240
And that I find extremely exciting because it means that maybe indeed we are the scales

53
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,800
we live on and we operate on are perhaps, in some sense, the leading edge of complexity

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
in the universe.

55
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,680
This is much simpler on small scales, much simpler on large scales, and that helps put

56
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
us in context.

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,760
And maybe if we understand the big picture, the universe on very large scales, we will

58
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,000
somehow understand where we sit in the universe.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,480
And I'm particularly excited about our recent work addressing the Big Bang, you know, this

60
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,720
is the most profound puzzle in all of physics, how everything emerged from a point.

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,360
And I think in the over the last year or two, we've really started to make sense of that.

62
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,040
And again, it indicates our new understanding is that the Big Bang is actually quite simple.

63
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,960
It's not a, it's not an arbitrary or chaotic or random process.

64
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,440
It's a very precise, I mean, if our theoretical ideas are correct, it's a very precise, very

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:10,240
boundary condition for the universe and highly principled boundary condition.

66
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:19,520
And if so, then, you know, the universe becomes much more comprehensible in its entirety.

67
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,800
And as you said, many other researchers work on more complicated theories that are not

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,080
embracing minimalism as much, why do you think others tend to stray away from these simpler

69
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
ideas?

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,080
I think, you know, we're all trying to follow the example set by Maxwell with Maxwell's

71
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,840
equations or Dirac with Dirac's equation, Einstein with Einstein's equation.

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:52,000
These are tremendously principled, economical, mathematical equations, which govern the,

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,760
you know, bewildering variety of phenomena and extremely predictive.

74
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:04,040
So we're all trying to emulate, you know, these highly successful theories we base

75
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,840
our current theories on.

76
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:15,240
But I think what happened is that particle theory over the last 50 years, maybe longer,

77
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,280
got into the habit of always postulating new particles.

78
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,040
And to some extent, this was natural because every time you built a new accelerator, you

79
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,200
discovered new particles.

80
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,960
And so this just became the norm is that, you know, we expect once in a while to add

81
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,160
a few new particles.

82
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,560
And the hope arose that by adding these new particles, at some point, we would actually

83
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,720
simplify the picture.

84
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,240
So in grand unified theories, for example, you try to make sense of the pattern of particles

85
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,040
around us by adding some more particles, and in such a way that the whole unified.

86
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,480
And that habit sort of persisted.

87
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,320
And so, but it generalized.

88
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:09,600
So instead of adding particles, people added extra dimensions of space and extra objects.

89
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:17,220
So there were strings in string theory and membranes and higher dimensional structures,

90
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,740
which were added to these theories, all in the hope of sort of unifying this in a principle.

91
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,180
However, the principles were somewhat lacking.

92
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:36,940
So string theory, you know, notoriously doesn't really have a clear conceptual foundational

93
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,380
principle in the same way that Einstein's theory of gravity had, you know, in Einstein's

94
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,020
theory, the conception was that you have curved space time and this curved space time tells

95
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,100
matter how to move.

96
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,380
And in turn, the matter tells the space time how to curve that's how John Wheeler famously

97
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,260
described it.

98
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,360
And those words, you know, besides being very beautiful, they capture a concept of how the

99
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,220
physical world works, which is very intuitive and very powerful.

100
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,660
And when it's translated into mathematics, it becomes highly predictive.

101
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,100
But string theory is lacked such principles.

102
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,980
And it's more been more a question of sort of follow your nose.

103
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,860
And when you come across some phenomenon, you sort of tweak the theory or you adjust

104
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,980
your interpretation.

105
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,380
And in particular, in cosmology, you know, quite a popular endeavor in string theory

106
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:45,460
has been to try to picture the universe as if it was what's called an S matrix.

107
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,780
An S matrix is something used to describe particle collisions, you know, things come

108
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,820
in and things come out.

109
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:00,900
But I think the way the cosmos works seems very, very different to an S matrix.

110
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,420
You know, there was a, at least in the part of the universe, we can see there was a starting

111
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
point.

112
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:15,980
And you know, there's this finishing point, which is, which is dominated by the energy

113
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,020
and empty space, the cosmological constant, sometimes called the dark energy.

114
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,980
And so I think trying to shoehorn the universe into a preconceived picture, which was designed

115
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,140
for particle physics experiments, to me seems, you know, a sort of search for a principle,

116
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,980
but not one that's particularly likely to work.

117
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,620
So I think people have been trying to find principles, which are economical and powerful

118
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,660
and will explain lots of things.

119
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,620
But to a large extent, those principles don't seem to be the right ones.

120
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:59,220
And as I say, the enormous simplicity of nature is hinting that there are principles

121
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,780
to be discovered.

122
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,300
And yeah, I'm hopeful that we're beginning to get on the right track.

123
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,060
I've heard you say that a key ingredient in doing this work is having a lot of dialogue

124
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,140
between theorists and experimentalists, but this is not always easy to do.

125
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,620
And I think there tends to be a bit of divide, a bit of a divide between these areas of research.

126
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,180
So how do you think we can improve this and have more effective collaborations between

127
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,420
theorists and experimentalists?

128
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,540
Well, I think it's difficult because both theory and experiment are very technical.

129
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,820
When I started as a PhD student, you know, it was very noticeable that the theorists

130
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,620
where I were in Imperial College had their own seminars and the experimentalists had

131
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,580
their own seminars and they generally never went to each other's seminars.

132
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:55,700
So the, you know, high level of technical complications in both aspects of science mean

133
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,260
that people don't have time to often to interact much with each other.

134
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,220
And that's, yeah, that's very sad because I do believe that theoretical physics should

135
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,020
be, you know, at its most exciting and most effective should be connected to observations.

136
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:23,140
And there's been an increasing sort of divergence of so-called pure theory from observations.

137
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,100
And even a sort of philosophical justification by saying, oh, well, you know, if we know

138
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,900
our theory is right for mathematical reasons, we don't really need to pay attention to the

139
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,900
observations.

140
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:43,220
And I am very critical of such point of view because I think you can really easily go wrong

141
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,540
in your mathematical assumptions and very quickly just diverge from anything to do with

142
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,940
reality.

143
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,020
You need to keep an eye, one eye on the observations.

144
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,540
It may not be in, you know, very detail, very much detail.

145
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,580
You don't need to get involved in experiments or data analysis or whatever, but you need

146
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:12,460
to pay very close attention to, you know, major observational results if you are to actually

147
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:18,340
build a successful theoretical physics framework.

148
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,420
So I think the field does need a bit of a reset.

149
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:31,700
It's particularly important for students to sort of appreciate the wonder, the sort of

150
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:40,980
miracle that theoretical physics is, that when it does connect to reality, it's quite magical.

151
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:49,220
And I think the students who don't pursue that or aspire to that are really missing

152
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,780
out on a lot, that one should, you know, never forget that the real magic in the subject

153
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,220
is when it connects to observations.

154
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,300
And these observations are extremely fundamental.

155
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,900
I mean, the universe, you know, we know things about the universe that the fact that empty

156
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:15,220
space seems to have an energy, the cosmological constant, that's very profound.

157
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,220
There are ideas, again, for interpreting the meaning of that, you know, what is this stuff

158
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,100
in empty space?

159
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,620
And then we have the dark matter, very good observations showing us that most of the matter

160
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,540
in galaxies is, doesn't interact with light.

161
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,700
We have some very interesting candidates for the dark matter, some of which are very minimal,

162
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,940
like neutrinos.

163
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,580
We know neutrinos exist, and it's a very simple and natural idea that one of the so-called

164
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,620
right-handed neutrinos is the dark matter.

165
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,660
And the exciting thing is that that hypothesis is possible to test.

166
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,900
Within the next five years or so, people are projecting that through observations of galaxy

167
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:12,260
clustering, one can actually detect even very tiny light neutrino masses.

168
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:18,580
And if one of the right-handed neutrinos is the dark matter, and if it's stable, then

169
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,060
it follows as a consequence that one of the light neutrinos is massless.

170
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,020
And that should be possible to confirm within the next five years.

171
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:33,940
It's very, very challenging work for people doing the observations and modeling, a lot

172
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,100
of computational modeling to understand how the light neutrino masses affect the clumping

173
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,340
of matter.

174
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:48,220
But so far, the predictions are that with the anticipated accuracy of the measurements,

175
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,420
we should be able to tell quite definitively within five years or so whether the light

176
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,580
neutrinos are massless.

177
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,420
And if that is confirmed, it will be a very strong indication that we're actually on the

178
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,740
road to understanding the dark matter.

179
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,980
And then there are other things like the fluctuations coming out of the Big Bang.

180
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:17,420
These take the form of quantum fluctuations in the vacuum, which is a very profound phenomenon

181
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,740
that the quantum fields we observe, like the electron or the photon or all the other fields

182
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,380
in the Standard Model, have fluctuations in the vacuum.

183
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,340
And these are very paradoxical and strange, have very strange properties.

184
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:39,500
For example, that if you add up all the energy in these vacuum zero point fluctuations, it's

185
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
infinite.

186
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,620
And that doesn't make any sense because gravity couples to energy and gravity would see that

187
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
infinity.

188
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,460
So for decades, we've been sweeping this under the rug and pretending it's not really there

189
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,660
and so-called renormalizing it away.

190
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,780
And this is not a good state of affairs because it means we do not have a physical picture

191
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,860
of what's going on in the vacuum.

192
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,740
And again, these new developments, some of which I've been involved in, are pointing

193
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,140
to resolution of these questions.

194
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:21,260
So that by modifying the vacuum of the Standard Model in a certain very precise way, you can

195
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:28,860
cancel this energy divergence and, in fact, protect some of the deep symmetries in the

196
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,580
Standard Model, one of which is called local scale symmetry.

197
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,620
So it's a surprising fact that a photon of light is pretty much the same as a photon

198
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,780
of X-rays or radio waves, and they're all just scaled up or down versions of exactly

199
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
the same thing.

200
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,620
And that's a very deep symmetry of Maxwell's equations, that it's so-called scale invariant

201
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,940
and even more than that's locally scale invariant, so you can change the scale differently in

202
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,260
different parts of space and time, and the equations remain the same.

203
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,940
This is, why is that such a deep symmetry?

204
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,300
Well, to describe the Big Bang, where everything came from a point, if all the material in

205
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:17,980
the universe was insensitive to the overall size of the universe, as it is for Maxwell's

206
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:24,060
theory or actually for Dirac's theory as well, then the stuff in the universe doesn't

207
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,700
know about the size of the universe at all.

208
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,700
So even though, from our point of view, all the strength to a point, the stuff of which

209
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,660
matter is made doesn't see the so-called singularity, and this makes the singularity

210
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,020
possible to model mathematically and to really understand, and to understand this boundary

211
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,300
condition I mentioned at the Big Bang.

212
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:57,540
So I think these principles, in other words, trying to deal with the vacuum energy infinity

213
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:03,220
or divergence, trying to deal with the Big Bang singularity, these are really pointing

214
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,820
us to the right principles, which will explain the universe on large scales.

215
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,620
And the thing I'm most excited about recently is that using these same principles, we've

216
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:20,300
been able to calculate the fluctuations we now see in the cosmic microwave background.

217
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,140
And amazingly, the numbers come out correct.

218
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,180
We get the right size of fluctuations.

219
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,940
We get the right spectrum without any free parameters at all.

220
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,540
And so this is early days, but it's a very exciting framework which may end up explaining

221
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,780
the universe and connecting it to the fundamental physics of particles in a much more precise

222
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,780
way than we ever thought was possible.

223
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:55,500
And is this something that you have been working towards your whole career, trying to work

224
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,820
on these very simple models with very few free parameters?

225
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
Yes.

226
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,020
Or would you say this is something that you've been exploring more recently?

227
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,300
Essentially, I have been working with the same motivation for my whole career.

228
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:17,220
I've always chosen to work on testable theories, even when most people don't.

229
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:25,660
And so as a student, I was very fascinated by an idea of my professor, Tom Kibble, that

230
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,140
there would be cosmic defects in the universe.

231
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,660
This was actually a consequence of gran unified theories.

232
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,340
And what was exciting about it is if gran unified theories were correct and if these

233
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:43,020
defects had formed as they predicted, we would be able to see them.

234
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,460
And so I spent a lot of time trying to calculate what they would look like, what observations

235
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,060
would detect.

236
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:57,500
And in the end, we disproved the idea that these defects gave rise to galaxies, which

237
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,100
was one of the popular theories of the 80s.

238
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:07,140
And I spent a lot of time trying to calculate precisely what the predictions were and then

239
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,260
when the experiments came along to check, they just proved those theories wrong.

240
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,780
So I was very fortunate to work on theories which could be proven wrong.

241
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,180
Then when string theory came along, like most other people, I was very excited.

242
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,580
Maybe this is a unified framework that really will explain everything as a theory of everything.

243
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,300
And I did my best to try to reconcile string theory with cosmology.

244
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,620
So we made a model of colliding brains in extra dimensions.

245
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,700
And I would say at that point, I was beginning not really to believe, I didn't necessarily

246
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:51,700
believe this framework, but I thought it was an interesting exercise to create a rival,

247
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,860
a competitor to the most popular theory, which was called inflation.

248
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,860
And hopefully one that was less adjustable and more connected to very fundamental physics,

249
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,260
as string theory was, quantum gravity and so on.

250
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:17,780
But I think the realization slowly dawned that this whole framework was too complex.

251
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,780
And especially as the observations have become simpler and simpler and the kind of signals

252
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,780
you would have expected from inflation have progressively gone away.

253
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:38,780
So one of inflation's predictions was that there should be very long wavelength gravitational waves

254
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:44,780
created a sort of aftershock of this burst of expansion in the beginning of the universe.

255
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,780
And you could see these long wavelength gravitational waves through observing the polarization of

256
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,780
the micro background sky.

257
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,780
And the measurements finally became accurate enough to see this effect.

258
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,780
Initially, they claimed they had seen it.

259
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,780
And so all the inflationists were very excited and thought, you know, this is verification,

260
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,780
including Stephen Hawking, my friend Stephen Hawking, bet me in public that or we had a

261
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
bet they would not see it.

262
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,780
They now claim to see it.

263
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,780
And so he wanted me to pay the bet.

264
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,780
And I said, you know, all experiments require verification.

265
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,780
And there were reasons to doubt this experiment.

266
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,780
In the end, the experiment turned out to be wrong.

267
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,780
And now what's happened is that the latest experiment see nothing.

268
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:49,780
And within five years or so, the upper limit on these gravitational waves is going to get so low

269
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:57,780
that I think most people, most sort of relatively unbiased people will draw the conclusion

270
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,780
that inflation probably isn't the way to go.

271
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,780
So that's really exciting.

272
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,780
The precision of the experiments has got to the point where, you know, large numbers of

273
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:14,780
popular theoretical frameworks are now under severe pressure.

274
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,780
So in the interim, you know, all these things influence me a lot.

275
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,780
But I think especially when I was working at Perimeter and I had the responsibility as director

276
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,780
of sort of deciding which fields were worthwhile to invest in, that made me look very critically

277
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:38,780
at the whole field of theoretical physics and try to assess, you know, where the best

278
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,780
prospects were.

279
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,780
And of course, that influenced my research.

280
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,780
And so when I left as director and I went back to full-time research, you know, I was very determined

281
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:57,780
to focus on theories which I sort of genuinely believe are promising and have a chance of,

282
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,780
you know, providing very large explanatory power.

283
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,780
And so that's what I'm working on.

284
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,780
And I know you've said that a lot of the work you're doing now relies heavily on some ideas

285
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,780
introduced by Stephen Hawking, who you already mentioned.

286
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,780
Can you say a little more on that?

287
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,780
Yes, I was very fortunate in many ways to know Stephen Hawking.

288
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:28,780
When I was an undergraduate, I went to his inaugural lecture called very provocatively

289
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,780
Is the End of Theoretical Physics in Sight?

290
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,780
And it was sort of lecture full of jokes.

291
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,780
And at the end, he concluded it was in sight.

292
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,780
And I was worried I'd missed the boat.

293
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
They'd sorted everything out.

294
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
It was supergravity was the answer.

295
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,780
And that was that.

296
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,780
But it proved to be over-optimistic.

297
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,780
And then later, I went back to Cambridge as a professor and made friends with Stephen.

298
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,780
And we wrote several papers together.

299
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:06,780
But what's special about Stephen is he had this...

300
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
He was extremely adventurous.

301
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,780
At the time, he started thinking about quantum gravity and black holes

302
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,780
and how they radiate and the thermodynamics of black holes.

303
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,780
That was far ahead of its time.

304
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:27,780
But his ideas were so deep, they have influenced the whole field for decades.

305
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,780
And the way I...

306
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:34,780
I think we're still struggling to understand what they mean.

307
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,780
And he was too.

308
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,780
We still don't really know what the entropy of a black hole means exactly.

309
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,780
We think it's to do with how many different ways there are to make a black hole.

310
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,780
But we still can't quite put our finger on it.

311
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:54,780
On exactly what it means and how it's compatible with all of the rest of physics.

312
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:01,780
But in our very recent work, and this is with Latham Boyle at Perimeter,

313
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:08,780
we've developed Stephen Hawking's concept of entropy, gravitational entropy,

314
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,780
to apply to the universe, the whole universe.

315
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,780
And that's been really surprising.

316
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:25,780
And in the course of that study, I've come to the conclusion that Stephen himself

317
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,780
underestimated the power of his own ideas.

318
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,780
So he developed the idea of entropy, of gravitational entropy,

319
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,780
entropy of black holes, entropy of the universe.

320
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,780
He never succeeded in calculating it for the universe, as we now have.

321
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,780
And so he tied his ideas to inflation.

322
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,780
Inflation, to put it bluntly, was the ragbag of models,

323
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,780
thousands of different models of inflation.

324
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:01,780
All of them tweaked and adjusted with lots of assumptions to fit what we see in the universe.

325
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,780
And my current understanding is you just don't need it.

326
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,780
You don't need to tie Stephen's ideas of gravitational entropy to inflation.

327
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,780
Just take them as they are, apply them to the real universe

328
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:21,780
without any extra particles or fields or inflation or anything.

329
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:28,780
And they already explain why the universe is big, smooth, and flat in themselves.

330
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
And so that's been very exciting.

331
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:36,780
I think we've found that Stephen's ideas are more powerful than he suspected.

332
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,780
And there are still questions about exactly what it all means,

333
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:49,780
but it looks like they can explain the structure of the universe without any additional input.

334
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:55,780
And then the other thing in what we're studying, you see Stephen's ideas were very paradoxical in many ways.

335
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:02,780
So he said the A black hole, which only has a mass, an angular momentum, an electric charge,

336
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
just certain numbers it has.

337
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
A black hole, and it's featureless.

338
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,780
A black hole is essentially a featureless object, like an elementary particle, but it can be huge.

339
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:18,780
This black hole can be made in so many ways.

340
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,780
Now, the weird thing about that statement is that surely the number of ways you can make a black hole

341
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,780
depends on how many different elementary particles there are.

342
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,780
If I've got particles A, if I've only got one type of particle, I can make a certain black hole,

343
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,780
but if I've got two types of particles, surely there are more ways to make a black hole.

344
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,780
So just assigning an entropy of a black hole immediately creates a puzzle.

345
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Why are there so many different particles in the standard model?

346
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,780
And does the entropy of a black hole depend on how many particles there are?

347
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,780
So the answer is, in his calculation, it's one result.

348
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,780
You can't adjust it.

349
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,780
You can't change the number of particles.

350
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,780
You can't change the entropy by changing the number of particles.

351
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,780
It's whatever it is.

352
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:14,780
That actually implies, I believe, that the number of particles in the standard model is fixed by gravity.

353
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,780
And we know there are three generations of particles, there are 16 particles per generation.

354
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:26,780
That number should be forced on you by the fact that standard model couples to gravity.

355
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,780
If it is, then the whole thing is absolutely self-contained,

356
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,780
and you just can't separate these puzzles from each other.

357
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,780
So particle physicists who are trying to understand how many particles there are in nature,

358
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,780
that question's meaningless unless you include gravity.

359
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,780
And gravitational theorists trying to understand the entropy of a black hole,

360
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,780
that question's meaningless unless you actually use the real number of particles in the world.

361
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:00,780
So I think that, again, the fact that Stephen's entropy ideas seem to be successful in describing a universe

362
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:08,780
indicates that physics is truly unified and not adjustable.

363
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:17,780
And so if all of this works, I would say we will be pretty sure that this is the entirety of physics.

364
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:23,780
Because if you add another particle, you're going to spoil all these cancellations and agreements.

365
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:32,780
So that's very exciting, that nature may itself be telling us how things unify.

366
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,780
And that all these kind of consistency arguments and arguments about the universe

367
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:43,780
and the Big Bang and consistency with observations may in fact all come together very beautifully

368
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,780
into a coherent mathematical picture.

369
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,780
I want to go back to something you said a few minutes ago that I really liked.

370
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,780
You said you feel lucky when you work on a theory that can be proven wrong.

371
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,780
And I like that because I think it's very different from how many other researchers would feel

372
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,780
in that situation, many others would feel very scared when they think they can just be disproven

373
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,780
at any moment with a new data that comes in.

374
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Why do you think it's so scary for some people the thought of being proven wrong?

375
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,780
You know, it's a funny thing, but reality is scary.

376
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:27,780
I don't quite know how to put it, but sometimes when you, for example, just go out into nature,

377
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,780
be it a snowy field in the middle of winter in Canada,

378
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,780
or you're hiking in some tall mountain range or something,

379
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,780
or you're just looking to empty space from Earth, and you think,

380
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,780
wow, this is real.

381
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,780
That can feel scary.

382
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,780
And so reality is scary.

383
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,780
And I think it's as simple as saying, you know, I do want physics to be real,

384
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,780
and reality is scary.

385
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,780
So we just have to face up to that.

386
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:10,780
The way to face up to that is to sort of enjoy this kind of amazing fact

387
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:17,780
that we are able to interact with nature and make sense of it.

388
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,780
You know, we don't understand why.

389
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,780
It's a clue why we can do that, except perhaps, you know, we've evolved capacities,

390
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:31,780
which somehow allows us to do that, but then they go way beyond what we ever needed to survive.

391
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,780
You know, so we have a scary capacity.

392
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,780
That's obviously true.

393
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:44,780
We can do all kinds of scary things, you know, but I think part of just essentially being a responsible citizen

394
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:51,780
and living up to the opportunity of life, which we all, you know, we all possess as a miracle.

395
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,780
We all have this amazing thing called life.

396
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,780
And I think just living up to that is facing these scary realities

397
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,780
and trying to, you know, deal well with them.

398
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:15,780
So, yeah, I do see this, particularly among students, a sort of nervousness, particularly about Korea.

399
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:22,780
You know, people say, if I work on, you know, a theoretical framework, which A may be risky,

400
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,780
maybe it's going to be mathematically shown to be wrong.

401
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:32,780
You know, that's probably the more immediate danger, because there's a lot more mathematics than there is physics.

402
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:38,780
So there are lots more models of physics than there are real, you know, correct models of physics.

403
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,780
So I think for students, sometimes it's more comfortable to work on a model or a mathematical framework,

404
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,780
which actually nobody is going to prove wrong anytime soon.

405
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,780
But those frameworks, you know, what I would say are often very unlikely to actually have much to do with reality.

406
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,780
And so you may spend, you know, you'll be in a sort of relatively comfortable place,

407
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,780
but you'll never experience the magic that the field is capable of.

408
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,780
This kind of search for safety is now very common across society.

409
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:16,780
You know, people don't necessarily want to deal with the difficult problems.

410
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,780
How do we look after the planet? How do we make sure we're not destroying the environment?

411
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:30,780
How do we reduce inequality? How do we create opportunity for more people to live decent lives and fulfilling lives?

412
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:37,780
On the one hand, you can just sort of stick your head in the sand and say, look, it's not my responsibility.

413
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,780
But, you know, I think that's not, again, not living up to what the world is offering you

414
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:54,780
and the privilege you have to be part of the world, and you should play a role in, you should rise to these challenges.

415
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,780
So I think this all comes together. I try to encourage young, you know, when you work in physics,

416
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:11,780
a very healthy attitude often is to say, look, I'm going to try something which sounds appealing, exciting, it may be risky.

417
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:18,780
You know, and I'll have a backup plan. If this doesn't work, if it's proven wrong, well, there's so many other wonderful things to do in life.

418
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,780
You don't have to follow the conventional path.

419
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:33,780
And if you end up compromising to such an extent, you know, that enables you to follow some conventional path,

420
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,780
you know, I feel you're really missing out on the possibilities which life offers.

421
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,780
Have you always had a backup plan in mind throughout your career?

422
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:52,780
I always did have a backup plan. I think, you know, in my own case, my parents both went to jail for their political beliefs.

423
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:59,780
And then they came out of jail and a few decades later were elected to parliament and both.

424
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:09,780
So, you know, they had a complete turnaround where their beliefs actually led them into positions of responsibility in government.

425
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:19,780
And so that was very inspiring for me. So I took from them that, you know, one really shouldn't compromise your beliefs.

426
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:35,780
And yes, I had a backup plan. If I think even from when I was a graduate student, I was a bit worried about aspects of theoretical physics that I doubted whether these models were actually real.

427
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:42,780
It was kind of a game. People were playing an interesting game, but it somehow didn't really ring true.

428
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Grand unified theories or string theories never really felt to me like they were a genuine insight into reality.

429
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,780
That's just a feeling, not necessarily one that you should trust.

430
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:08,780
But as a result of that, I basically said to myself, look, if I don't make it in theoretical physics, if I'm not able to make a good contribution,

431
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:19,780
you know, my dream was I would go and be a wildlife warden in a game park in East Africa.

432
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:30,780
That's because I thought there's sort of nothing more fun than sort of looking after lions and antelopes and rhinos in the wild.

433
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,780
So yeah, I always had that as a sort of at least a mental backup plan.

434
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:42,780
If nobody wants me in physics, you know, I'll go and do something much more exciting.

435
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:50,780
In fact, you know, another sort of strange thing about me is that when I was a postdoc in California,

436
00:38:50,780 --> 00:39:00,780
I used to have a recurring sort of nightmare, which in the nightmare was that I actually got a faculty position back in my original department in London

437
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:08,780
that I'd be walking down the corridor and I'd see these names on the doors and I came to this door and my name was on it.

438
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,780
And I woke up, you know, in a cold sweat.

439
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,780
Oh no, I'm a faculty member.

440
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:23,780
So the academic career, you know, is not the pinnacle of human experience.

441
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
You know, I love my colleagues.

442
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,780
I like being an academic.

443
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:39,780
I think universities are wonderful places for many reasons, but you should use them to enjoy it and have fun and, you know, not see that as a goal in itself.

444
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:49,780
As you've said, a lot of these things you're bringing up are topics that I think students struggle a lot with and you devote a lot of your time to mentoring and giving advice to students,

445
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:58,780
including yesterday you met with a large group of PSI and graduate students here and a few of them sent in some questions for you that I'd like to share.

446
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,780
So let's start with one from Sabah.

447
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,780
I'm Sabah and I'm a PSI student.

448
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,780
And before coming to PSI, I was working mostly in cosmology.

449
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,780
And then after entering PSI, I got introduced to this whole new phase of doing quantum gravity and quantum foundations.

450
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:20,780
And I decided to somehow work in these directions while I'm in PI, foundational aspects of quantum gravity.

451
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:35,780
And now I'm at the start of my PhD that I'm really trying to figure out whether I should continue working on cosmology like I was doing before or continue doing this kind of like quantum gravity and foundational aspects of quantum gravity from like quantum information point of view.

452
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:45,780
And at this point, I feel that I found my question and I think the question for me at the moment is to like to somehow figure out quantum gravity problem of quantum gravity.

453
00:40:45,780 --> 00:41:02,780
And I don't know what is the most promising avenue to somehow approach the question like when reviewing cosmology, it looks like that at very early point, everything becomes classical and we don't really know if by studying cosmology,

454
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,780
how can I directly address the interest in quantum gravity.

455
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:22,780
And yeah, I just want to know your opinion about what do you think about cosmology in context of quantum gravity, whether the avenues that one can pursue inside cosmology and what are the most promising ways to somehow do some phenomenological quantum gravity.

456
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Okay, thank you for the wonderful question. I think you are asking the right question. You're recognizing that we're gaining, you know, wonderful insights from observation in cosmology.

457
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:49,780
And you want to apply it to learn something about quantum gravity, which is the big missing component in fundamental physics, the part of the standard model if you like that we understand least is is quantum gravity.

458
00:41:49,780 --> 00:42:08,780
So you're asking the right question. The problem is we don't know the answer yet. And I would say the following that, you know, the sure bet over the next 10, 20 years is that observations are going to continue to bear fruit.

459
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:15,780
We're going to get more and more precise measurements of the fluctuations coming out of the Big Bang.

460
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:36,780
And with that precision, you know, we have much greater power to test theory. So I think that's a very sensible avenue for anyone to take is to get into data analysis, interaction with observations, modeling the observations and so on.

461
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,780
I think and I hope many people will go into that direction.

462
00:42:41,780 --> 00:43:02,780
Now, I sense from your question that you are more attracted to the more fundamental questions. That's a great thing. But, you know, keep in mind that people have not solved this problem for, you know, more than 50 years, probably 75 years, people have been trying to solve these problems and failing repeatedly.

463
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,780
So the chances of your actually making success are very, very small at best.

464
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:22,780
So what you can do, I think is pick problems which are instructive, where you are dealing with gravity and sort of refining your understanding of Einstein's theory and of quantum mechanics.

465
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:43,780
If you'd like to think about it as a musician, you know, you we have all these wonderful works by classical composers, and it's great to practice, as well as very rewarding just to sort of review those and and play give them your own spin, and find better ways of explaining them, and so on and so forth.

466
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,780
And I think that kind of work is never wasted.

467
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:58,780
And so provided you don't expect to really answer, you know, these very, very difficult questions, then I think you will find the work very rewarding.

468
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:13,780
The chances that a solution to this puzzle, you know, will come in the next, I'm very optimistic, the next 10 or 20 years there will be at least much better resolutions of these puzzles.

469
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,780
But the chances are small.

470
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,780
And exactly who finds it is is a random question.

471
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,780
It could be anyone.

472
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,780
And probably it will be somebody unexpected.

473
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:37,780
So it might be, you know, a PhD student somewhere in a in a in a very minor institution who comes up with the key idea.

474
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,780
That's one of the exciting things about fundamental research could could be anyone.

475
00:44:43,780 --> 00:45:03,780
But if you're in a position where you're studying these questions carefully and rigorously, and you are very critical, critically aware of the different approaches and frameworks, then you'll be in a good position to to respond to any such breakthrough, which happens.

476
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:14,780
And if a breakthrough does happen, whether it's by you or by anyone else, you know, obviously that's going to blossom into many, many other areas.

477
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:28,780
I mean, if we understand the second we understand quantum gravity and how it relates to the universe, there will be a huge variety of outcomes and questions and predictions and and interpretations.

478
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,780
And that's something which, you know, you could easily spend a lifetime working on.

479
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:52,780
So, yeah, I would encourage you to go in that direction, study it very carefully, very seriously, don't put all your bets on one horse, because whatever horse you bet on is unlikely to to be the correct approach.

480
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,780
And as you said, these breakthroughs can come at any time and from anyone.

481
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:12,780
And I know one thing you were very known for during your time as director at perimeter was fostering an environment in this academic institution where those breakthroughs could take place from from anyone, not necessarily just from senior faculty members.

482
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:20,780
What do you think are the most essential ingredients that an academic institution needs in order to foster those breakthroughs?

483
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:34,780
I think it's a recognition that the most likely people to come up with original ideas are the youngest people and that community of young people.

484
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,780
So I see the community of young people as the most important in the Institute.

485
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,780
Don't get bigheaded.

486
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,780
Those young people watching this, but I do see that.

487
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,780
And I think furthermore, they need to be very diverse.

488
00:46:47,780 --> 00:47:06,780
I think diversity is very often a source of strength and enthusiasm and, you know, difference is very, not just, it encourages new ways of thinking.

489
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:22,780
It's a commonplace, but very often in physics, the best new ideas come about when two different strands of thought collide and suddenly realize that the other one has some insight they can benefit from.

490
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:46,780
The Higgs mechanism in the Higgs boson is a classic example where Peter Higgs was aware of ideas happening in superconductivity, which were by and large ignored by particle physicists, mainly because particle physicists were fairly arrogant and they couldn't possibly believe that somebody studying materials could actually give them a real insight.

491
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:55,780
But Higgs grabbed that insight and interpreted it in terms of and incorporated into particle physics.

492
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,780
And that was extremely profound and important development.

493
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,780
Although, you know, initially it was resisted.

494
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,780
People didn't believe what he was doing at all for several years.

495
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:22,780
So, so yeah, I think diversity of different types of people from different countries from different cultures, especially gender diversity is really important among that young physics community.

496
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,780
And it should be an environment.

497
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:33,780
I think another very important thing is that the people who often are most original are very often odd in certain respects.

498
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:43,780
They are unusual people and they're not necessarily very good at coping with, you know, the everyday rigors of life.

499
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:56,780
And so it's very important that any community which fosters talent be specially supportive of people who are unusual in whatever respect.

500
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,780
So I think that's essential.

501
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:23,780
And again, by supporting unusual people, different people, that's probably the best way of ensuring the field isn't a monoculture or pursuing the same direction, you know, which as I've already expressed, you know, the most popular directions haven't panned out in the last 40 years.

502
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:31,780
And, and, and that's reason why we should make sure we pursue a real diversity of directions.

503
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,780
No, I want to ask you more about these unusual people and how you find them.

504
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,780
But first, maybe let's just go to one more question from a student.

505
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,780
This one was sent in from bat salya, who's a PSI student.

506
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:52,780
And he wrote in asking, do you think that as theoretical physicists, it is our moral responsibility to pursue research that explains the real world?

507
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,780
Or is it okay to just enjoy playing with mathematical structures?

508
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,780
Yeah, that's a difficult question.

509
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:07,780
I do think I think above all that theoretical physics is very, is very hard.

510
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,780
And it's very hard to it's a kind of torture.

511
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:16,780
We do these very difficult complicated calculations and they take days or weeks or months.

512
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,780
And sometimes you just end up with a paradox and confusion.

513
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:29,780
So it's, it's not an easy life choice, but somehow we do enjoy it.

514
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:42,780
And, and, and so I think in order to make sense of why we enjoy it, it's quite good to have at least some idea why, you know, some idea of our motivation.

515
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,780
I've met a lot of theoretical physicists who like nothing more than making diagrams.

516
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:53,780
And they say, you know, they like writing papers because it's a chance to make a diagram that they can put in the paper.

517
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,780
But the part of it they actually enjoy is making the diagram.

518
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,780
So, you know, people do it for all kinds of reasons.

519
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,780
I don't think there's much of a moral responsibility.

520
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,780
I see it more as a responsibility to yourself.

521
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,780
You know, don't, don't delude yourself.

522
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:24,780
I guess that would be my, my overriding message is if you like playing with mathematical frameworks and if you're good at it, then by all means do it because the work you do will be good.

523
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:33,780
And other people will draw, you know, may well draw some interesting physical conclusions even if your work is just mathematical.

524
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:41,780
So I would never denigrate anyone for doing something they enjoy, especially when they're doing it well.

525
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:48,780
Even if it doesn't directly relate to physics, it's more like playing a game, a mathematical game.

526
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,780
I think, you know, that's fine to do.

527
00:51:51,780 --> 00:52:06,780
But as, as I say, I, in a certain sense feel sorry for them because, because I think the real magic of physics is that these mathematical considerations end up connecting with reality.

528
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,780
That's the deep mystery of the field.

529
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:17,780
Somebody said this to me a few days ago, you know, mathematicians make their frameworks and do their calculations.

530
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,780
But physicists somehow have a direct line to God.

531
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,780
Now, I don't believe in God.

532
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,780
I'm not religious, at least not in any organized sense.

533
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:46,780
But, but I think there's a kind of element of truth in that that somehow physicists have uncovered a fundamental feature of existence, which is this strange ability of our minds to really make sense of what's around us.

534
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,780
It's a very deep puzzle.

535
00:52:48,780 --> 00:53:08,780
And I think if you like the best way we can appreciate that puzzle and, and further it and pay it homage almost is to, is to practice that to make sure we what, you know, what we do does or to try to relate the mathematics we do to the real world.

536
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:16,780
In many ways you're speaking to this idea that physics needs many different people, including people who like to make diagrams.

537
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,780
Yes.

538
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,780
Maybe people might be considered unusual.

539
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,780
Yes, absolutely.

540
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:30,780
Maybe another way to say it is people that don't necessarily succeed in the traditional academic hierarchy that we've constructed.

541
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:37,780
So I guess as a director, it must have been very challenging to find the right people because you probably couldn't just look at the applications.

542
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:43,780
They submitted, which are maybe trying to show you other metrics than the ones you would, you would want.

543
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,780
So how did you go about finding the right people?

544
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,780
Yes.

545
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:58,780
So I think that this was something I'm particularly proud of as director is that, you know, when I came to Bremeter, the faculty was very small and they're really there.

546
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,780
It wasn't really structured at all.

547
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:06,780
And it wasn't clear how it should be structured.

548
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:12,780
The government and supporters had made big investments in Bremeter, and it was very important.

549
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:25,780
Those paid off in the sense that the Institute actually did good work and it became recognized as a place, you know, where excellent theoretical physics was done.

550
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,780
So it was quite a challenge.

551
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:34,780
And I think I took the point of view that we needed very rare people here.

552
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:39,780
We could, there was nothing stopping us from recruiting from all over the world.

553
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:50,780
And we needed to look as widely as possible and sort of keep our eyes and ears open for unusual people who'd done something unexpected.

554
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:58,780
So it wasn't a matter of reading applications or, you know, it was really being proactive.

555
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:11,780
I also learned that the senior physicists who were advising us weren't often, weren't always, or even often, the best source of ideas as to who to hire.

556
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:20,780
Because usually they had their own field and their own visibility, you know, region that was visible to them was very limited.

557
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:28,780
And secondly, if they saw somebody really good, they thought was really good, they would try and hire them themselves and not recommend them to us.

558
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:31,780
So that was interesting.

559
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:42,780
So I think the short answer was just by really keeping eyes and ears open and looking for very unusual people who maybe had unconventional career paths.

560
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:54,780
And then imagine what would happen is when you hired them, if you gave them much more freedom than are usually given to young faculty.

561
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:03,780
So one of the rules we introduced is that as a young faculty member, you should not spend more than 20% of your time on administrative duties.

562
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:09,780
So that includes teaching, mentoring, applying for grants.

563
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:20,780
And that's extremely unusual because most universities, you know, when a young faculty member arrives, they're immediately loaded with teaching and grant applications.

564
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:24,780
And they, you know, very often judged on their success in winning grants.

565
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:31,780
And I think that's very antithetical to original pursuing original research.

566
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:38,780
So I would always tell the young faculty, you know, go after some problem that really fascinates you.

567
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:45,780
If you don't publish anything for, you know, two, three years, it's no, you know, no problem.

568
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,780
You will explain to us that, you know, I went after this very difficult problem and we will all respect you for that.

569
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:59,780
You know, we're investing in you because we think you have the capability of doing something unusual.

570
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,780
And so please go after something unusual.

571
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:11,780
And you know, of course, we'll advise you and try to try to make sure you do enough to keep your career going.

572
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:20,780
But it should be a much more sort of supportive framework than is usually provided to young faculty in universities.

573
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:34,780
So I see it the job of an institution is more to challenge people to really be adventurous and ambitious rather than to judge them all the time.

574
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:48,780
And, you know, particularly on criteria like publications, citations, conference talks given and all that, you know, these are really the sort of

575
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:57,780
these are more the symptoms of physics. They're not the essence of what we're trying to do.

576
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:04,780
So in many ways, I try to set an example where perimeter used very different metrics to judge people.

577
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:14,780
I think metrics like how creative are they, how, how stimulating are they to have around?

578
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:20,780
Do they have original ideas? Do they question things? Are they asking good questions?

579
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:31,780
You know, those, those characteristics of people are actually much more important than the more conventional measures of success.

580
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:39,780
It seems like it really involves looking at the Institute as a whole, rather than just evaluating whether each individual person is successful.

581
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:51,780
Yes, one of the biggest diseases of the academic model, particularly in North America is the idea that every research has a grant and they use the grant to support their postdocs and their students.

582
00:58:51,780 --> 00:59:01,780
So what you're doing is deliberately putting individual researchers in competition with one another and deliberately creating hierarchies.

583
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:07,780
And I see this everywhere. It's also become increasingly common in Europe and elsewhere, I'm sure.

584
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:21,780
And I think this, this model of the, you know, single investigator at the top of a pyramid is actually very destructive of creativity, originality, questioning.

585
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:27,780
You know, because the more junior people don't want to question the senior person who holds the cash.

586
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:36,780
And I think that's the wrong way to do things. I much prefer a much flatter structure.

587
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:51,780
And actually, conceptually, I think a much better picture is the inverted pyramid, where the senior people, if you like, are at the bottom and their job is precisely to support the younger people.

588
00:59:51,780 --> 01:00:01,780
And, you know, the flowers on the tree, they can be the root, but the flowers on the tree are the young people and that's really where the emphasis should be.

589
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:12,780
It seems like a lot of the things you would ideally look for, like being creative, asking good questions, are things that are maybe more difficult to measure or difficult to predict ahead of time.

590
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,780
So I guess another essential ingredient is maybe being okay with taking risks.

591
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,780
And I'm just wondering if that's true.

592
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Is it important to kind of embrace the fact that some of those choices you make might not work out?

593
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,780
Very much so.

594
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:39,780
As I say, when I talk to students today, I'm very often struck by they say, you know, well, I'd like to do something more exciting and more interesting, but it would be risky.

595
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:49,780
And, yeah, I find that very disappointing that people, I understand it, you know, they need to ultimately make a living.

596
01:00:49,780 --> 01:01:07,780
And young people today are, as a sort of, as a generality, young people today are much less secure than they were in my day as a student, where I think we felt that sort of, if for whatever reason, things don't work out, you know, there are plenty of alternative options.

597
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,780
And we weren't nervous about livelihoods in the same way.

598
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,780
They're very good economic reasons for that.

599
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:27,780
You know, the ability to find jobs is certainly more difficult today than it was several decades ago.

600
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,780
And even my generation, it was much harder than it was in previous generations.

601
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:42,780
Previously, universities were really at least advanced research was the privilege of a very small number of people.

602
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:50,780
And as a result, they had much greater job security and didn't really worry about getting academic positions.

603
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,780
So my professors never really worried about this at all.

604
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:00,780
I didn't have to get grants, you know, money was more or less just provided in the 60s.

605
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,780
So the climate of the field has changed.

606
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:09,780
Part of that has been letting larger numbers in to the field, which is a good thing.

607
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:16,780
Widening access means greater pool of talent and, you know, things should move faster.

608
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:29,780
But what has come along with that is much more standardization and, you know, prescription telling young people, you've got to do ABC to get a job.

609
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:33,780
And I think that's very, that's been damaging.

610
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:42,780
And I see this all across higher education, actually, is that the quality of degrees now being awarded, I don't think is what it should be.

611
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:52,780
Even if you look at undergrad degrees, you know, the curriculum has become very standardized and rather dull and initiative is not rewarded.

612
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:56,780
So this is not in isolation, you know, it's, it's everywhere.

613
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:04,780
This sort of massification and then standardization and loss of creativity.

614
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:13,780
So theoretical physics is very fortunate because it's such a cheap field, you know, we just need a blackboard and chalk and occasionally a computer.

615
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,780
It's really a very cheap field.

616
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:28,780
So if anybody is going to recreate, you know, the organization of science more optimally, it has to be theoretical physics.

617
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:38,780
You know, we have one of the most effective of all sciences, if not the most effective in terms of predictions, theoretical physics, you know, can't be matched.

618
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,780
We have the cheapest.

619
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,780
We have the easiest, the most universal easiest to access.

620
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:56,780
You don't need a lab, you know, you, you, you can come to a summer school and learn some ideas and, and, you know, they may enable you to write a very interesting paper.

621
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:02,780
So theoretical physics should be setting the example for the rest of science.

622
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:11,780
So it's very, very important that we strategize our field carefully and wisely.

623
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,780
And I, I don't think that's happening in general.

624
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:26,780
You've also said in many ways that diversity is a very important ingredient and it just reminds me of something that I noted down that you said yesterday when you were meeting with students that I really like.

625
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:32,780
You said theoretical physics is special because it's cross cultural and everyone has the same questions.

626
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,780
Yes.

627
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:41,780
And so I just want to ask you because you have throughout your career traveled all around the world met with researchers at every level and from everywhere.

628
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:46,780
What do you think are those questions that everyone is asking?

629
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,780
Well, I was very struck.

630
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,780
For example, I'll tell you one little story.

631
01:04:51,780 --> 01:05:01,780
So I was in Senegal and I was teaching electromagnetism relativity and there was a student who had done maths at university.

632
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,780
So not physics and was, it was kind of a lively student.

633
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:13,780
You know, so I, I asked the whole class, you know, when I started the course, what would you like to be?

634
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:28,780
And, and his answer was a billionaire, which, which actually, you know, you can say it's kind of crass, but compared to the other students who largely said, I want to be a professor.

635
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:38,780
You know, I found it more exciting to have somebody who's at least not just saying, I want to repeat, you know, exactly what the people who taught me and so on.

636
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,780
Anyway, so he wanted to be a billionaire.

637
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:45,780
So we started chatting and then he was very puzzled by physics.

638
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:46,780
You know, what is all this stuff?

639
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:52,780
You keep referring to reality and light and all that new writing down some equations and so on.

640
01:05:52,780 --> 01:06:01,780
So then we had at some point an interaction about the problem sheets and at some point it involved instabilities.

641
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,780
And at some point, you know, I was trying to explain what this instability was.

642
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:09,780
And at some point he said to me, oh, you mean physics is just logic?

643
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,780
And I said, yes, that's exactly what it is.

644
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,780
It's logic applied to nature.

645
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,780
Ah, now I get it.

646
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,780
Right.

647
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,780
And then he got very interested.

648
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:33,780
And then in subsequent days, and this is the, the wonderful thing about meeting someone from a completely different culture and background, academically, as well as, you know, culturally and linguistically, everything.

649
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:40,780
You know, he, he started to say, gosh, you know, you can apply logic to the real world.

650
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:43,780
And then he, you know, naturally, what do you do?

651
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,780
You point to the stars and in Senegal, where we were, it was in a nature reserve.

652
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,780
It was actually a wonderful place.

653
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:56,780
And there's this huge open sky with the stars and you immediately say, what are those, you know, what's the logical basis of stars?

654
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:03,780
And then you, that was an excuse to have a conversation about how stars form and how they work and nuclear physics and, and so on.

655
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:09,780
And so, yes, people very naturally ask the same questions.

656
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:17,780
It's because we all live in the same universe and we're all sort of puzzled and amazed by the same natural phenomena.

657
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:22,780
And, and so that is the cultural unifier.

658
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:35,780
You know, when is the realization that the phenomena which are just around us all the time and which are miraculous in various ways, you know, that we can share this.

659
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:42,780
We all do share it and we can discuss with each other and share our understanding of how that works.

660
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:47,780
And that somehow gives you a grip on the world, you know, which you share.

661
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:53,780
And I do think also it makes you feel more responsible and more empowered.

662
01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:00,780
And if you understand the world, you're certainly much more empowered than if you're just kind of at its mercy.

663
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:10,780
And so I think this understanding between different cultures, different peoples, fundamental understanding of the world is very empowering, is very unifying.

664
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:16,780
It makes us all feel, you know, we're part of the same enterprise.

665
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,780
And so that's that's really the most exciting thing of all.

666
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:27,780
Definitely. Well, Neil, thank you so much for this amazing conversation. It's been so much fun to talk to you. Thank you.

667
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,780
Thank you very much.
