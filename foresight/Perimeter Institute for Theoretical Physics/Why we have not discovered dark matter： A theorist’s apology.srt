00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,040
Hello, bonjour, bienvenue, and welcome everyone to Perimeter Institute's public lecture series.

2
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,880
My name is Emily Petroff, and I'm Perimeter's Associate Director for Strategic Partnerships,

3
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,120
Grants and Awards.

4
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm delighted to welcome you back to the Mike Lazaridis Theatre of Ideas here at the Perimeter

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Institute in Waterloo.

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,040
It's a great pleasure to welcome you tonight at the Perimeter Institute for those of you

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,240
who are sure we'll have a fascinating presentation.

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
Perimeter Institute was created to be a gathering place where people can come together like

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,080
we're doing tonight to ask the big questions about the universe and search for the big

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,040
answers.

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,160
Perimeter will soon celebrate 25 years of bringing people together from all paths, researchers,

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,560
students, the general public, teachers, to explore the fascinating world of physics.

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,080
But people on this land have been asking the big questions about the universe for thousands

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,580
of years.

15
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,040
Looking up at the night sky and understanding our place in the cosmos is a human constant

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,960
throughout the ages.

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,800
We acknowledge that Perimeter Institute is situated on the traditional territory of the

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,200
Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, and Neutral Peoples, and is located on the Haldeman Tract, the

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,960
tract granted by the British, to the six nations of the Grand River, and the Mississaugas of

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
the Credit First Nation.

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,000
We greet and thank the diverse peoples who preceded us, and we encourage them to act

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,440
responsibly and collaboratively to advance the quest of knowledge for the good of all.

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:18,640
We thank the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Neutral Peoples for their support.

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,880
For those watching the live webcast, please join the conversation online.

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,040
We are at Perimeter on Twitter, or X, and if you have a question for our speaker, you

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,600
can ask it with the hashtag PI Live.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,040
This week, Perimeter Institute has been hosting a fascinating workshop called Dark Matter First

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,280
Light, which brings together experts to discuss the ways that dark matter impacts the formation

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,760
and evolution of stars and galaxies.

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,760
This workshop, which concluded today, focused on the new observational programs and techniques

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,120
coming online and new modeling tools that may enable a better understanding of the mysterious

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,040
matter you'll hear more about tonight.

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,840
And now, it is my great pleasure to introduce one of those workshop attendees and our speaker

34
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,680
for tonight.

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,040
Theoretical physicist Philip Flip Tenedo is an associate professor at the University

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,480
of California, Riverside, and his research seeks to determine the fundamental physics

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,240
of dark matter.

38
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,800
He's a 2021 career award winner from the U.S. National Science Foundation and a 2020

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
Hellman Fellow.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,800
He has appeared in popular media on shows like Nova and Science Friday.

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,480
Dr. Tenedo grew up in Los Angeles and is a proud product of the Los Angeles Unified

42
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,880
School District.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,960
He earned his bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics from Stanford University

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,480
before completing graduate studies at Cambridge University, Durham University, and Cornell.

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,440
He spent three years as a chancellor's advanced postdoctoral fellow at the University of

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,760
California, Irvine, before moving to Riverside.

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,920
Dr. Tenedo is the first Filipino-American professor of physics and he has served in

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,560
several official capacities as an advocate for equity and academia.

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,040
His research focuses on developing a fundamental theory of dark matter.

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,040
His work has interesting intersections with fields including particle cosmology, machine

51
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,040
learning, and information.

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,480
Tonight he will discuss recent developments in the search for dark matter and how the

53
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,120
scientific community can come together to find new answers.

54
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Please join me in welcoming to the stage Professor Flip Tenedo.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Good evening everybody.

56
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,720
My name is Flip.

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,800
I am a theoretical physicist and I work on dark matter.

58
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,840
So quick show of hands.

59
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,640
How many people have heard of dark matter?

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Good.

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Good.

62
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Good.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Good.

64
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,920
You know what dark matter is?

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,800
One hand up.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,280
So we're all in good company.

67
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,960
We are all in the same tribe.

68
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Very good.

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,720
We're all in the same boat.

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
All right.

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,040
So let's get started.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,200
Here is my very best attempt at a completely realistic picture of dark matter.

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,920
It's completely invisible.

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Okay.

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,040
So that's not very interesting.

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,160
If you'll permit me a little bit of artistic license.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,080
Here is astronomers up to false color of their photos.

78
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,680
Here is a false color illustration of dark matter.

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
And I've even done the extra work of sketching where we are.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
This is the Milky Way.

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,440
And we're sitting in this bubble of dark matter, this big blue bubble of dark matter.

82
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,800
And if we were to zoom out again in this artistic rendition, we would notice that our bubble

83
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,920
of dark matter is actually sitting in a cluster of bubbles of dark matter.

84
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,400
And I didn't draw it here.

85
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:04,040
But if you looked into each of these bubbles, most of them also happen to have galaxies

86
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
sitting there.

87
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,280
That's interesting.

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,080
And David Foster Wallace had a story once where there were two fish who meet in the

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,480
ocean.

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,600
And the first fish says, isn't it great that we have water?

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,760
And the second fish says, what the hell is water?

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,560
And this is where we are as a scientific community thinking about dark matter.

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,080
What we know is that we are little fish living in oceans of dark matter.

94
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,360
There are bubbles in a cluster of other bubbles of dark matter.

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,600
And there is so much that we do not know, but we know that that much is true.

96
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,200
And this is our cosmic mystery.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,480
So like all mysteries, there's a who, what, when, where, why, and how.

98
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,240
And we won't quite go through them in this order.

99
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,120
This is a piece of art, it's an installation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

100
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,280
And in this dark matter business, we have a phrase that we overuse.

101
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,240
And the phrase is looking under lampposts, looking in the dark under lampposts, looking

102
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,720
for truth, finding some angle to learn about this mysterious thing that we're in.

103
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,160
So this is going to be our guidepost.

104
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,280
These are my attempts at lampposts for understanding not just what is the puzzle, but how is it

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,680
that me, a theoretical physicist, which you might already think and my colleagues do think,

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,480
what can you possibly do if you don't have a lab, am tasked with understanding a substance

107
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,880
that surrounds us that we can either see, nor touch, nor smell, nor taste, nor anything

108
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,880
else to the best of our knowledge and then somehow do science on this.

109
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,800
It's a bit of a tall order, isn't it?

110
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,320
So let's start with what.

111
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:06,360
And in fact, what I need from you today is to start with the assumption that dark matter

112
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,520
exists and there's one thing that we know pretty well, which is roughly how much there

113
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,200
is, right?

114
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,480
Of all this matter, all the stuff in the universe, all the things you would call chunky matter

115
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:27,080
like things, we're dark, we are about 15% and most of the rest of it is dark matter.

116
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Are we okay with that?

117
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,480
We're all on board?

118
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,520
Anybody skeptical?

119
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,960
Any physics students in the room, any science students in the room, very good.

120
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,560
And I will speak for you.

121
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,560
You are all feeling very uncomfortable right now.

122
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,400
You do not like someone sitting here telling you there's this invisible thing that surrounds

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,880
the universe and it's real, I just need you to believe me.

124
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,640
All right, so let's not just take this completely on faith.

125
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,040
There is evidence for the existence of something more, something that we do not understand.

126
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,600
For these bubbles of dark matter that we live in.

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,880
And the evidence comes from the sky.

128
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:11,040
When we look at the motion of stars in galaxies, when we look at motions of clusters of galaxies

129
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,960
that happen to be pancaking towards each other in the distant sky.

130
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,960
And when we look at the photons from the cosmic microwave backgrounds, the very first photons

131
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,920
from 13 billion years ago reaching our telescopes today, each of these probes give indelible

132
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,400
evidence that there is stuff that is clumped up that cannot be explained by protons, neutrons

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,960
and electrons and their cousins.

134
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Everybody convinced now?

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,720
Are we all on board?

136
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,160
Physics students are all on board?

137
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:54,560
Okay, so one of the organizers for the conference that I've just come from is Katie Mack who

138
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,040
is sitting here in the audience.

139
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,920
She's a faculty member here at PI.

140
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,760
You've heard of her?

141
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,640
And I had the special joy of attending one of Katie's colloquia at the Aspen Center

142
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,600
for Physics a few years ago.

143
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,320
And Katie gave us a fantastic talk which I am summarizing in this board which you cannot

144
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,360
read deliberately so because I don't want to give that talk.

145
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,080
I am not qualified to give that talk.

146
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,480
But here are 12 pieces of evidence that Katie has organized for why we are so sure that

147
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,320
dark matter exists.

148
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,680
Now you might be able to read the titles.

149
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,640
What is important here is that there are many reasons.

150
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,840
What is important here is that they're complementary.

151
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,600
And so it's not just that you see a few stars.

152
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,840
It's not just you see a galaxy cluster.

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,320
It's not just that you observe this cosmic microwave background.

154
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,120
That's like saying if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's probably a duck

155
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,200
and therefore dark matter.

156
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,480
But all of these different pieces of evidence are telling you.

157
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,560
Taking at different length scales, at different times in the cosmic history, it's not only

158
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
that it walks like a duck, it talks like a duck.

159
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,520
It's got feathers, a beak, it has duck DNA, and it tastes great with hoisin sauce.

160
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,960
So that doesn't mean that it is definitely dark matter.

161
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,440
Like this guy on stage is saying it's dark matter.

162
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,760
But what that does mean is if it is not dark matter, something really strange is going

163
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
on.

164
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,400
The most conservative thing we can say is that all of these different pieces of evidence

165
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,400
are pointing to something that looks like stuff matter.

166
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,040
That is not the stuff that we are used to.

167
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,280
So that's where we are.

168
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,640
It would be amazing if it weren't dark matter.

169
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,320
Something way more exciting is happening.

170
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,960
So the other thing that you might notice, all of this evidence is coming from the sky.

171
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,920
Astronomy and cosmology.

172
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,480
There is no problem with inferring that dark matter exists from astronomy and cosmology.

173
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,440
I am a theoretical particle physicist.

174
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
The problem is in my tribe.

175
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,120
The problem is what is this dark matter?

176
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,440
So let me jump to a very different type of question.

177
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,120
When is dark matter?

178
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,760
Why is it that we are studying dark matter now?

179
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,280
And this is where the apology of my talk comes in.

180
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,120
So let me give you a very biased, it's almost true.

181
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,840
Anybody here who is a specialist will know this is not quite true, but this is morally

182
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,760
true of history of dark matter.

183
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
And this is a history of two tribes.

184
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,320
So physics, where the problem is, and astronomy, where the observations are.

185
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:55,320
And this goes all the way back at least until Orton's wiki, who observed in the early telescopes

186
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,920
that the motion of galaxy clusters didn't quite match what they expected from the calculations

187
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
that they made.

188
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,160
And they said, hey, you know what, this data really looks consistent with missing matter

189
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,800
that is not the ordinary stars that we expect to see.

190
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,120
Now I wasn't around at the time, but I imagine what happened between the 1930s and the 1970s.

191
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,280
People said, well, that's kind of interesting, this is a brand new telescope, telescopes

192
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,600
are hard, we don't really understand these instruments, so who knows what's going on.

193
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,760
And in the 1970s, Vera Rubin also came to the same conclusion, looking at a completely

194
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,680
different scale, looking at spiral galaxies, like the spiral galaxy, the Milky Way that

195
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
we are in right now.

196
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,600
So this is a completely different system, right, as Vicki was looking at clusters of

197
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,040
galaxies, Rubin was looking at spiral galaxies, and the motion of stars within the spiral

198
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,400
galaxy also seemed to imply, oh, wait a second, there appears to be missing stuff.

199
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:09,640
Okay, now I imagine in the 1970s, if you were a particle physicist, a fundamental physicist,

200
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,360
whatever that means, and you just happened to be sitting there in your office, sitting

201
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,760
on your thumbs, not knowing what was going on, you had nothing better to do in your life,

202
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,000
nothing, you would have dropped everything and thought about this problem.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,360
This would be the problem to solve.

204
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,640
It just so happens that in this other tribe, and usually the astronomy and the physics

205
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,160
floors, there are different floors in the building, so it really feels like a different

206
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,280
tribe, in this other tribe, something else was going on.

207
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,720
Around this period of time, particle physics, which was a new field, were building new toys,

208
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,880
these colliders where they're smashing together protons and elements, and producing all sorts

209
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,960
of new and unexpected particles.

210
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,880
And it was a puzzle, why are we getting all of these particles, where are they coming,

211
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
are they inside the atom, what does that mean?

212
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,960
And I will arbitrarily pick a period of 1970, so my higher mark will be the Nobel Prize

213
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,640
for what's called the electroweak theory.

214
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,480
There is a tremendous effort leading up to this and after this, but this is a benchmark

215
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,800
for me for the development theoretically of what we now know as the standard model of

216
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,120
particle physics.

217
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,960
And it was a heroic effort between experimental and theoretical physics to build this mathematical

218
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,520
edifice.

219
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,320
And there was one puzzle, which had obsessed the community, rightfully so, and that puzzle

220
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,880
had to do with the reason why we built the Large Hadron Collider and that thing is called

221
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,280
the Higgs Boson.

222
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,680
So how many people here have heard of the Higgs Boson?

223
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,320
I suspect it as much, I'm a crowd that comes to the perimeter institute in the snow outside.

224
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:08,160
So the story then, the apology then, is if we have known about missing matter for almost

225
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,440
a hundred years, why is it that we're talking about dark matter and the theoretical progress

226
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,920
in dark matter in the 2020s with fresh new oz?

227
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
So let me take you, let me continue this biased history.

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,280
Let's go back to my tribe, particle physics.

229
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,640
This edifice that we built up, the standard model, if you ask me, the standard model looks

230
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,680
like this.

231
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,400
And if you wanted to be fancy and if you visited CERN, you can buy a mug like this, which is

232
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,560
roughly the mathematics behind this ugly thing.

233
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,840
This ugly thing is a table.

234
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,600
And it's a bit strange, but we've seen tables before.

235
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,960
Some of us have taken chemistry.

236
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,480
Those of us who did poorly in chemistry went on to do physics.

237
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,040
But in chemistry, you have the periodic table, right?

238
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,200
Anybody hear a chemist before I say a few chemists?

239
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,040
Now the periodic table, I'm going to guess not even chemists say, I love the periodic

240
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
table.

241
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,960
The periodic table is so great because I can look up any atomic number and learn the math

242
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,800
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

243
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,120
I think that's a fair statement.

244
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,720
But the periodic table is fantastic.

245
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,080
And it's not fantastic because of the data that is inside it.

246
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,440
It is fantastic because the table is an organizing principle.

247
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,640
If you have a box on the table, you know there's an atomic number, there's some number of protons,

248
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,960
some number of neutrons, da, da, da, da.

249
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,960
You know if there's something missing.

250
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,920
And this is a mathematical picture of what we call the standard model of particle physics.

251
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,000
The periodic table is beautiful because as physicists we understand that the periodic

252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,760
table reflects a deep mathematical organizing principle and that is quantum mechanics applied

253
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,560
to atoms.

254
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,640
So this is what third and fourth year physics students do in the quantum mechanics courses.

255
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,560
And this thing, this mess of a table is beautiful not because they're these weird funny symbols

256
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:31,000
and they look kind of alien, but because this also reflects an organizing principle.

257
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,480
And this organizing principle lives within a generalization of quantum mechanics called

258
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,520
quantum field theory.

259
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,480
And what this table is, each row is a class of particle or a quantum field if you want

260
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
to be fancy.

261
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,040
These are their funny names.

262
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,380
Each row, one half means these are matter particles.

263
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,060
If it's not one half, it's a force particle, we'll get to the H in a bit.

264
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:00,460
And each of these columns is one of the three fundamental forces of particle physics, so

265
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,420
gravity is not included here.

266
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:08,220
And each of these funny symbols is a mathematical description of how those particles interact

267
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,540
under these fundamental forces.

268
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,300
So if you have new particles, the new particles should have something called spin which tells

269
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:21,020
if it's matter or a force particle and some numbers over here or some symbols over here.

270
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,020
And the one thing that was missing from the standard model of the 1970s was something

271
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,460
related to the Higgs boson.

272
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,580
It was this question that if we didn't have this last row, something funny happened to

273
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:41,820
our equations when we calculated the likelihood for two particles to smash together.

274
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,100
And the mathematics were giving us weird numbers like infinity, if that's even a number, any

275
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,500
mathematicians.

276
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,180
And the simplest explanation for why this theory would make sense is that there is one

277
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,460
more line here, the Higgs boson, that had particular properties and if you turn the

278
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,580
crank, everything made sense.

279
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,180
Everything except for one thing.

280
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,340
So we had a great idea of finding the Higgs boson.

281
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,620
If the Higgs boson actually exists, most of you know the answer, if the Higgs boson

282
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,940
actually exists, there was one additional puzzle.

283
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,260
Why is it so light?

284
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,940
We now know that the Higgs boson weighs about 125 times the mass of a proton.

285
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,180
If you turn the crank in this theory, you would expect it to be much heavier.

286
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,540
So this is give and take that didn't quite make sense.

287
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,500
And so if you zoom back to the 1990s and you went to the particle physics floor, not

288
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,940
the astronomy floor, they had two choices.

289
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,620
One choice was this puzzle of why is the Higgs boson light?

290
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:58,940
This was a puzzle that their community had built up to over 40 years of colliding particles

291
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,660
and building mathematical models, learning what all these weird symbols and tables meant,

292
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,580
and oh yeah, this is an open question.

293
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,420
And then there was this puzzle that our friends downstairs, our friends with these funny telescopes

294
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,260
and they go out at night, they're kind of like vampires, and they kept telling us this

295
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:23,860
weird thing about this missing matter, okay, which one are you going to work on?

296
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,620
The one where there were faculty who will hire you as a postdoc.

297
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,820
So this was the most important question.

298
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:37,060
And now I'm going to lead us down to the story of an opinionated, mostly correct story of

299
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,540
the weakly interacting massive particle, the wimp.

300
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,260
And this dominated our idea of what dark matter ought to be, and as a scientist you'd be really

301
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,740
careful when you say nature ought to be something for about 30 years.

302
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,300
And here's how it works.

303
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,660
So you have this big problem, this big deep problem.

304
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,140
Why is the Higgs boson light?

305
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,100
You do the calculations, it doesn't seem to make sense.

306
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,260
But you realize that there's a way to explain why the Higgs boson would be light, and that's

307
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:16,860
to invoke some deep, elegant mathematical principle that would explain why the theory is actually

308
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,620
more constrained.

309
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:27,180
Here is one such deep, elegant mathematical principle, it's called supersymmetry.

310
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,940
Symmetry is some deep, elegant mathematical relation between force particles and matter

311
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
particles.

312
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
And they all have silly names.

313
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,740
If an electron is a matter particle, there's a silly force particle, they say electron.

314
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,220
You have to get your kick somewhere.

315
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,620
So what?

316
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:53,260
So this ends up solving this puzzle that we had found.

317
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,060
Symmetry, because every particle has a copy, gives you new particles.

318
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,220
This theory predicts new particles.

319
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,660
So lesson number one, moe particles, moe problems.

320
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,460
I want this all to be on board with that.

321
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
So what happened?

322
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,820
Oh, this theory has more particles.

323
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,140
So what?

324
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,100
It turns out, the moment you put these new particles in, and you knew exactly what they

325
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:26,660
were, because for every proton, there's a super proton, all this stuff, protons suddenly

326
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,300
have new reactions where they can decay.

327
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,700
Well, that seems kind of dangerous.

328
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,780
You're here, I'm here, our protons are still around.

329
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,580
And in fact, for the physics students in the room, the bound on the lifetime of the proton

330
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,180
is actually longer than the age of the universe.

331
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,860
So you should think about, how do we have a bound that is longer than the age of space

332
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,100
time itself?

333
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,940
But protons are pretty darn stable, so that's not a good feature.

334
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,540
But we're thinking, you know, this is some weird practical problem, and this is this elegant,

335
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,900
deep mathematical thing was so beautiful, let's try to save it.

336
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,940
And what we do is we put a bandaid, a mathematical bandaid, and we invent some additional symmetry.

337
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,060
It's not deep, not elegant, but we just say, maybe there's some rule that prohibits these

338
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,700
interactions, and it has this silly name, r-parity.

339
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,460
And I will bet you nobody in this entire institute knows what the r means in r-parity.

340
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,700
I don't know.

341
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,180
But what this r-parity does, mathematically, you apply r-parity, and that means that the

342
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:46,420
interactions that would have caused the protons to decay are no longer allowed.

343
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,180
And it looks like everything starts to work again.

344
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:54,220
You solve your deep elegant problem, and the immediate other problem that comes up seems

345
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,780
to be okay, and you start feeling pretty good.

346
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,220
You bring your team of graduate students, and you look at this, and you say, hey, what

347
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,420
else does this theory do for us?

348
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:12,460
Well, with all of these new particles, and some reason, some parity, it turns out the

349
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,620
lightest new particle is stable.

350
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:22,540
So the reason why electrons don't decay into neutrinos, which are these other funny particles,

351
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,980
is because electrons are the lightest particle that carry electric charge.

352
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,540
There's no way to conserve charge if that electron decayed.

353
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:39,140
So the lightest new particle which carries r-charge is stable, cosmologically stable.

354
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,380
And it is at this point that we think, hey, you know, I heard something about cosmologically

355
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,700
stable new particles.

356
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,260
Oh, it was our friends downstairs, as we go down the stairs, and they say, what do you

357
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,220
know about dark matter?

358
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,540
And the one thing that we knew about dark matter is roughly how much there is.

359
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,620
So there's a calculation to be done, and it's a good thing, because there's a grad

360
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,100
student now in the room who says, hey, you know what you should do?

361
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,940
Do this calculation.

362
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,100
And let's be very honest, the first thing the grad student does is, nah, that calculation

363
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
is hard.

364
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,900
And it is hard.

365
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,100
It's hard because this calculation is telling you how much dark matter is left over after

366
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,780
the Big Bang.

367
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,060
So on the one side of the calculation, you're doing this particle physics calculation, something

368
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,780
about quantum mechanics and reaction rates for producing dark matter and dark matter annihilating.

369
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,180
On the other side of this calculation is something about the expansion of the universe to figure

370
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,260
out how much dark matter is left over.

371
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,420
So you have gravity, you know, G-Newton is in there, and on the other side, you have

372
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,740
all these particle physics numbers, and the grad student says, you're telling me that

373
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,580
you want me to do this really hard calculation.

374
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,900
Learn all this general relativity, and you expect me to match this arbitrary number from

375
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,420
these people downstairs who I've never met in my entire three years as a grad student.

376
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,940
And you say, yeah, it's for your thesis.

377
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:13,140
And wouldn't you know, wouldn't you know that the number that comes out is the correct number?

378
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,540
No, OK, that's a lie.

379
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,580
But it was a correct number within a couple of orders of magnitude.

380
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,660
I need astronomers, at least one astronomer in the front row.

381
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,740
But if you're a particle physicist sitting on the fifth floor and the astronomer's on

382
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,060
the fourth floor, you think, two orders of magnitude, that's amazing for astronomy.

383
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,900
You're dead on.

384
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,660
So we write papers and we celebrate.

385
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,100
OK, you wake up the next morning feeling pretty good about yourself.

386
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,820
And then someone knocks on your door.

387
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,900
Who's here at 9 a.m.?

388
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,020
You open up the door.

389
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,540
Professor, that was a fantastic series of paper you wrote about super symmetry and

390
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,980
dark matter.

391
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,580
I'm your new grad student.

392
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,660
What are we going to work on now?

393
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,380
And you think, oh, gosh, I don't remember that I hired a grad student.

394
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,660
Well, there is one game that I know how to play.

395
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,660
And it's this puzzle of why is the Higgs light?

396
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,020
Oh, maybe we got it wrong last time.

397
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,860
OK, let's try alternatives.

398
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,500
Let's look for some other deep, elegant, mathematical explanation for why the Higgs

399
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
mass should be light.

400
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,900
And it turns out one such deep, elegant, mathematical solution is to extend space

401
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,580
time, have an extra dimension.

402
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,100
Totally weird.

403
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,180
Turns out it can kind of work.

404
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,220
Well, if you have an extra dimension, what do you get?

405
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,180
Like higher modes in the violin string, like higher octaves, these extra dimensions

406
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,620
predict new particles.

407
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
Huh, OK.

408
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,420
And what happens when you have new particles?

409
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,860
Mo particles, mo problems.

410
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,940
Turns out these new particles, when you put them into your theory, screw up all sorts

411
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,060
of weird observations that we found over the past 30 years.

412
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,820
So that can't be right.

413
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,980
It's not quite proton decay, but related to proton decay.

414
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,540
And there are weird different flavors of extra dimensions.

415
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,620
And so the grad student starts to slump.

416
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,260
We say, it's OK.

417
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,900
We've done this before.

418
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,220
So you invent a humbler new symmetry.

419
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,460
It's a band-aid, mathematical band-aid.

420
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,740
It's called collusive client parity.

421
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,380
What that means is some of these new particles are prohibited from interacting

422
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:38,260
in certain ways, and it ends up curing these observables, just like preventing

423
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,860
the proton from decaying.

424
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,420
And the grad student says, oh, good.

425
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,620
What else happens?

426
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,980
Well, once you have a new symmetry and some conserved charge, the lightest new

427
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,620
particle is stable, cosmologically stable.

428
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,420
And the grad student says, OK.

429
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:00,980
And then, well, what I would like you to do is to read your predecessor's thesis

430
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,980
and learn how to do the calculation where this new light particle, this lightest

431
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:13,460
particle with KK charge, how much of it is left over in the universe?

432
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,340
And the grad student says, OK, well, I can read the previous student's thesis,

433
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,380
but that was like a shot in the dark that it worked out.

434
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,100
How do you expect?

435
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,780
And you said, just do it.

436
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,860
And while the grad student is going through this calculation, you look at this chart

437
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,300
and you realize the new particles that you get, you know a lot about these new

438
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,060
particles.

439
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,700
You know a lot about them because they inherit their properties from the Higgs

440
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,180
and all of the Higgs' cousins.

441
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,300
Why?

442
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,020
Because there is this deep, elegant mathematical symmetry.

443
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,900
It's like a mirror.

444
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,540
The thing on the other side of the mirror, you know what that person looks like.

445
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,900
And so when the grad student comes back and says, would you believe?

446
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,540
You'd say, yeah, it probably works out, doesn't it?

447
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,700
And you're starting to realize it's not a coincidence.

448
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,940
The details of the calculation change, but the numbers that go in are all basically

449
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,700
the same scale numbers.

450
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,100
The grad student goes off to celebrate and you buy a bottle of champagne for their dissertation.

451
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,980
Next morning.

452
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,420
Professor, oh my gosh, I love the series of papers that you're doing.

453
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,780
What's my first project?

454
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,020
I'm your brand new grad student.

455
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,300
And you think, holy moly, this large electron collider has better turn on soon

456
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,140
because I am running dry.

457
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,580
But you think, well, why is the Higgs light?

458
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,700
Let's think of a new ring.

459
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,740
Maybe there's substructure.

460
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,500
Maybe the Higgs is not a fundamental particle, but there are some, you know,

461
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,980
sub protons and sub neutrons that come together to form the Higgs.

462
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,340
Oh, OK.

463
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,660
So what does that mean?

464
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,300
Well, if you have like sub protons and sub neutrons and you have some other particles.

465
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,620
Great.

466
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,260
Is that OK?

467
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,700
No, probably not because you have all these observables that we have seen.

468
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,180
And these new particles screw it all up.

469
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,100
Oh, should I be said?

470
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,860
It's OK.

471
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,580
We can apply a bandaid.

472
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,180
This one's called T-parity.

473
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,380
I'm pretty sure.

474
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,980
Actually, people at Perimeter might know what T means.

475
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,500
And I should ask.

476
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,420
What does it do?

477
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,260
Well, it solves this problem.

478
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,220
And it means that the lightest new particle is cosmologically stable.

479
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,500
And then you tell the grad student, go and do the calculation.

480
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,900
I'm pretty sure it's going to work out.

481
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,300
It almost has to.

482
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,140
The details of this calculation, even though it's on the one side,

483
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,220
it's all particle physics.

484
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,140
On the other side, it's all general relativity.

485
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,980
The fact that they're all the same essential properties,

486
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,940
the same essential mass scales, the same essential fundamental

487
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,260
couplings, even though the details change,

488
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,380
if they're within a couple of orders of magnitude,

489
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,700
it's going to land in that window.

490
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,380
And it does.

491
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,940
And as a discipline, you are feeling pretty darn good.

492
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,580
Not only was there this puzzle where you needed a Higgs boson.

493
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,140
OK, we predict the Higgs boson.

494
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,660
But then you anticipated another problem.

495
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,620
And you came up with this deep, elegant mathematical solution,

496
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,740
not just one, but three.

497
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,660
It's got to be one of them.

498
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,700
And each one of those predicts new particles that

499
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,700
solves the downstairs people's problems.

500
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,340
Not only are we doing great in our field,

501
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,700
we're solving astronomy's problems.

502
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,220
Good for us.

503
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,140
Oh, boy.

504
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,820
It's a no-lose scenario.

505
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,100
You tell your colleagues, we have to build a collider.

506
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,540
We have to look for the Higgs.

507
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,300
And then we will learn truth.

508
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,180
There's something to see.

509
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,420
If you didn't find the Higgs, that's even better.

510
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,100
It's a bigger mystery.

511
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:41,060
So circa 1990s, this is what the standard model of particle

512
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,540
physics looked like to a theoretical particle

513
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,140
physicist.

514
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,180
And this is what experimental particle

515
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,460
physicists looked like to a theoretical particle

516
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,780
physicist, which, of course, I'm joking.

517
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,100
This is how progress happens.

518
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,100
And the key point is, when you have this no-lose theorem,

519
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,140
that there is a deep, meaningful reason

520
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,260
to build this collider, because whatever comes out,

521
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,820
you will learn truth.

522
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,220
You very quickly go from this to this.

523
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,140
And then even faster than it took to build this,

524
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,620
you go from this to this.

525
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,820
So how many people here remember the Nobel Prize

526
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,820
for the Higgs boson, 2013?

527
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,700
Very good.

528
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,900
And then remember the Nobel Prize for the discovery

529
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,860
of supersymmetry.

530
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
That's right.

531
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,620
The Nobel Prize for the discovery of extra dimensions

532
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,740
of the compositeness of the no.

533
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,820
So something went tremendously right.

534
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,900
There was a Higgs boson.

535
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,420
But something went tremendously wrong.

536
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,300
So 2013 also happened to be the year

537
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,900
that I defended my thesis.

538
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,460
It was a thesis you probably have heard of the chapters.

539
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,620
Chapter one was supersymmetry.

540
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,620
Chapter two was extra dimensions.

541
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,700
And chapter three was the compositeness of the Higgs.

542
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,740
And all of the great new things we

543
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,180
would discover at the Large Hadron Collider.

544
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,980
I don't know how it happened, but by some happenstance,

545
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,900
someone put me in contact with science news.

546
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,700
And the next thing I knew, I was literally the poster child

547
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:35,300
for a particular type of ennui among particle theory

548
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,540
graduate students who are graduating right around this time.

549
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,940
And it was so great.

550
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,460
It was a perfect love story.

551
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,540
You solve this problem in particle physics,

552
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,980
and for free, you predict the solution to this other problem.

553
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,100
And what this meant was that maybe the love story

554
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,140
has a breakup.

555
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:03,260
And like your first love, when it ends,

556
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,820
you get a little bit gothy.

557
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,140
And that's when I said, you know what?

558
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,300
I'm done with the Higgs boson.

559
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,220
I am now a dark matter theorist.

560
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,580
And there was some reason to this.

561
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,180
There's this idea that there is still an open problem

562
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,860
and a toolkit for building theories that

563
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:25,780
had not been fully utilized directly for this problem.

564
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,100
How do people feel right now?

565
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,220
I know my own emotional feelings about this.

566
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,660
It takes some time to get over it.

567
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,100
But it's a little bit of a downer.

568
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,460
So let's move on to where.

569
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,860
And here is where there's a little bit of hope.

570
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,380
Because even though this fantastic program of the weakly

571
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,300
interacting massive particle, the supersymmetry

572
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,220
actually dimensions, composite Higgs,

573
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,540
even though all of that didn't quite pan out

574
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,740
as well as we had hoped, it worked great for Higgs,

575
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,300
we still have the large hadron collider, which

576
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,300
probes smaller length scales than ever before probable

577
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,060
by the human race.

578
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,780
This is humanity's best microscope ever built.

579
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,140
We still have labs like Snow Lab, about 400 kilometers

580
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,980
north of here, where we have the most pristine environments

581
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,940
to look for the chance interactions of dark matter

582
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,820
scattering off of a nucleus, some of the most pristine

583
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,780
environments, again, literally ever made by humanity.

584
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,620
We still have an upcoming program of telescopes

585
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,780
to search with higher and higher resolution for this light

586
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,100
from 13 billion years ago.

587
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,140
And this is a site in Chile in the Atacama Desert.

588
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,260
And completely unexpected, we now

589
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,700
have gravitational waves, which are literally

590
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,700
a brand new way and qualitatively different way

591
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,660
of seeing the universe through radiation of space

592
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
and time itself.

593
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,780
We are equipped to make progress on this problem.

594
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,620
And so for all that I will apologize,

595
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,580
and you know what, maybe the 1990s and 2000s,

596
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,420
we were thinking in the wrong direction.

597
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,900
This program, some of its serendipitous,

598
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,340
is well suited where we have a fighting chance

599
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,980
to make deep progress on this question.

600
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,740
So for the past two years, the North American particle

601
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,380
physics community goes through this decadal process

602
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,340
where we review one of our priorities,

603
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,060
our scientific priorities, in our field

604
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,420
of fundamental physics.

605
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,500
And it should not surprise you that one

606
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,900
of the unifying themes was to understand,

607
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,580
what is dark matter?

608
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,060
All right.

609
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,740
So that says something about particle physics.

610
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,700
That says something about where the field is.

611
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,140
I am a theoretical particle physicist.

612
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,340
How is it that I search for dark matter?

613
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,020
All right, so I have a quiz.

614
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,700
This depends on whether or not you're wearing glasses.

615
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,180
What is the difference between these two pictures?

616
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,340
Anybody?

617
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:07,940
Good.

618
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,420
So one of these is the Millennium Falcon.

619
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,140
I think this is a screenshot from one of the movies.

620
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,900
Let me say this is the Millennium Falcon.

621
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,780
The other is a Lego model of the Millennium Falcon.

622
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,100
And there's something very deep here

623
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,140
that I think rings true to any physicist.

624
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,820
The model is an approximation for the actual thing.

625
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,580
If you zoom into the model, if you lift it up,

626
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,900
if you look around, if you pick it up,

627
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,340
you say, hey, this thing is kind of small to be the Millennium

628
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,300
Falcon.

629
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,420
But in the right context, you learn something

630
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,420
about the Millennium Falcon.

631
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,580
You learn, oh, maybe this little deflector dish, which

632
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,740
fell off in one of the movies.

633
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,580
It's roughly the same size as this bit over here.

634
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,700
There are things you can learn from a model.

635
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,820
But the model is not nature.

636
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,940
The fact that you have a mathematical model

637
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,060
does not prescribe what ought to happen in nature.

638
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,140
And this is where we are.

639
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,740
So when you ask, what is it that theoretical physicists do?

640
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,780
There's a misconception that we tell you what nature is.

641
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,500
We don't do that.

642
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,860
We cannot do that.

643
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,860
We build mathematical models, and here

644
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,220
is the model that we introduced earlier, the standard model,

645
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,500
to describe nature and to mock up nature

646
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,980
and maybe glean some principles that nature realizes,

647
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,860
but that is not a prescription.

648
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,700
So there is this great painting.

649
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,460
It says, this is not a pipe.

650
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,140
I will spare the Quebecois, my attempted French.

651
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,020
But when we do theoretical physics,

652
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,420
we are exploring what types of models

653
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,460
can explain the dark matter puzzle

654
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,940
and what can we learn from those mathematical models.

655
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,380
And like any good crime procedural,

656
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,980
there is a motive, means, and opportunity.

657
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,260
A mathematical model for dark matter

658
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,340
answers these questions.

659
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,860
First one is, what is it?

660
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,460
Some super symmetric partner, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

661
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,820
The next thing is, how did it get here?

662
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,340
You have to explain what mechanism created this particle.

663
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,860
Then most of the particles that we know of

664
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,540
are actually unstable.

665
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,620
You have to explain, why is that particle still around?

666
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,580
And given that we've been searching for dark matter

667
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,780
for 30 years, then your theory has

668
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,020
to say why we haven't found it yet.

669
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,820
And any theory worth its weight will tell you,

670
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,300
and this is how you will discover this type of particle.

671
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,940
It'll give you something falsifiable.

672
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,780
And so for the weekly interacting massive particle,

673
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,100
there is some deep, elegant mathematical symmetry

674
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,460
that explains to you what this new particle is.

675
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,900
And that was very deep, and exciting, and meaningful.

676
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,060
Then there's a series of answers.

677
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,140
How did it get here?

678
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Well, the same way that ordinary particles got here

679
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,460
through something called thermal freeze out,

680
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,460
that was the calculation that we asked the grad student

681
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,580
to do over and over and over again.

682
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,500
Why is it still here?

683
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,740
We have to put that band-aid on.

684
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,100
Remember, if you put this band-aid on,

685
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,540
you solve some problems, and for free you get stable particles.

686
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,860
Why isn't it ruled out?

687
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,340
Well, for all we know, dark matter might still be a wimp.

688
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,700
How do we discover it?

689
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,220
For the wimp, we keep doing exactly what we are doing,

690
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,780
because we have the experimental program to probe this.

691
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,860
But there are other answers to these questions.

692
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,300
Maybe it's less interesting what the deep mathematical

693
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,380
principle is before.

694
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,980
Maybe we start with, there is dark matter.

695
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,300
Let's build the simplest building blocks, the simplest

696
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,460
LEGO model, the simplest mathematical model,

697
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,260
and see what comes out.

698
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,140
And then, how do you discover it?

699
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,060
You start thinking more creatively.

700
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,020
If there are different answers to how to get here,

701
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,580
you have different interactions, which

702
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,180
means there are different reasons why it's stable,

703
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,940
and you have different ways in which it'll manifest itself.

704
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,220
And one of the really great things

705
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,020
we've been talking about over the past three days here

706
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,900
at Perimeter is one puzzle that I'll shout out, which

707
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,260
is there are a handful of black holes.

708
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,820
So this is a quasar with an artist's rendition.

709
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,940
There's a handful of these.

710
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,620
So our galaxy is far, far away that

711
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,940
are powered by a supermassive black hole.

712
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,580
And what's the difference between a black hole

713
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,100
and a supermassive black hole?

714
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,260
The supermassive black hole is so large

715
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,300
that our understanding of how black holes form

716
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,780
cannot explain how they got so down large.

717
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,620
And the usual story is that first you form stars,

718
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,980
and stars form little black holes.

719
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,020
Little black holes combine to form big black holes.

720
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,500
But that cannot happen fast enough

721
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,900
to explain these gigantic black holes.

722
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,380
And one of the really cool things that we've been doing,

723
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,980
this is a photo taken earlier today,

724
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,740
has been puzzling over the ways in which the dark matter, which

725
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
we know was already in these galaxies,

726
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,380
because they held the galaxy together,

727
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,940
might be contributing to answering this puzzle.

728
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,220
And how this puzzle might be the first step

729
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,180
in this refined way of looking at this open question of learning

730
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,500
something new about dark matter.

731
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,700
All right.

732
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,380
So this is just a slice of the type of really exciting types

733
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,580
of questions that we've been thinking about.

734
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,900
Now, I want to change gears here and answer the who.

735
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,140
So who gets to do this thing?

736
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,380
Who gets the privilege of exploring the cosmos

737
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,380
using theoretical physics?

738
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,820
And there's an analogy that we often use.

739
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,940
Dark matter is in dark.

740
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,020
It's invisible.

741
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,900
And the analogy has to do with equity and diversity

742
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,100
in physics.

743
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,420
It's probably not surprising that such an analogy would

744
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,060
come about.

745
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,740
There are a few different analogies.

746
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,500
And in the same way that dark matter

747
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,940
is a puzzle of missing mass, mass that we don't understand

748
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,540
what it is or where it came from,

749
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,380
there's just missing talent puzzle.

750
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,220
Oftentimes, when you walk into a room in a physics department,

751
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,420
the people that you see there have a different demographic

752
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,340
makeup than the people that you see outside the university.

753
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,660
And the analogy here is, why is it

754
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,020
that we've discovered all this stuff about atoms?

755
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,820
Like, we know all sorts about chemistry.

756
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,340
We know about biology.

757
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,860
It's because ordinary matter, protons, electrons, neutrons,

758
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,940
and trinos, well, not neutrinos, are charged

759
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,420
under electromagnetism.

760
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,340
That is the probe that we use to see, smell, taste, hear

761
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,780
everything about matter.

762
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,900
Dark matter does not seem to have

763
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,740
that privilege of being charged.

764
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,700
That means our telescopes, our microscopes, all our tools

765
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,860
do not automatically work the way

766
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,580
that they do for ordinary matter.

767
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
That doesn't mean that dark matter doesn't exist.

768
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,620
That does not mean that the talent doesn't exist.

769
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,300
And there's a lot of fantastic books writing about what this is.

770
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,660
These are people who are far ahead of their journey

771
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,220
in thinking about this puzzle than I am.

772
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,020
And I encourage you to take a look if you're interested.

773
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,260
But another way in which this is analogous to the puzzle

774
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,380
of dark matter is that this is not a puzzle of missing data.

775
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,940
Just like Katie's slide, we have many, many reasons

776
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,500
to believe that there is a missing mass problem.

777
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,700
And there is no shortage of data that

778
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,860
across different types of demographic slices,

779
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,340
whether it's gender or ethnicity or unseen things

780
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,220
like socioeconomic background, belief, political background,

781
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,780
all of these things, the demographic inside the ivory

782
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,660
tower is different from the demographic outside.

783
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,900
So it's not a matter of missing data

784
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,140
or orders of magnitude in astronomical observations.

785
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,700
Like the puzzle of dark matter, maybe the way

786
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,180
that we have been doing things might not be the best way.

787
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,780
Maybe there should be new approaches

788
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,700
and new theoretical instructions, new frameworks

789
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,980
to approach this puzzle.

790
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,940
And when we think about this, there's

791
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:58,220
something that oftentimes well-meaning people will say

792
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,540
in earnestness.

793
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,300
Well, but physics doesn't care about the color of your skin

794
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,420
or your race or your gender.

795
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,340
Maxwell's equations are indifferent to the human

796
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,540
who is creating them, right?

797
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,700
It's a reasonable thing to say.

798
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,580
But oftentimes, the people who say this at one stage

799
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,860
of their career go on.

800
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,980
And then there's inevitably some road bump,

801
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,500
because we all hit road bumps.

802
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,620
And then there are different things that are said.

803
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,180
Oh, well, the committee would have selected me

804
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,940
if only I had this fancier university on my diploma,

805
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:31,780
if only I had this fancier knickknack on my CV.

806
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:35,860
Or if only I had advanced calculus when I was in high school,

807
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,740
I'd be able to do research when I was my first year of college.

808
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,780
Or when one's hand is the only brown hand in the classroom,

809
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,460
maybe it's a little bit harder to be the one

810
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,660
to ask a question.

811
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,620
And I mention these because these

812
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,780
are sociological human issues, even though the subject itself

813
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,220
is indifferent to the humanity.

814
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:03,900
And to be able to do this, this is a human endeavor.

815
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,860
I argue, though, this is still the wrong way

816
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,340
of thinking about it.

817
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,220
So how many people here saw Oppenheimer?

818
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,100
That's a smaller percentage than I expected.

819
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,940
So one of the characters in Oppenheimer is Vannevar Bush.

820
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,460
This is his character over here.

821
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,940
And for those of you who saw the movie,

822
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,820
the person he's shaking hands with is the villain.

823
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,740
But Vannevar Bush was the architect

824
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,540
of what is now known as the National Science Foundation.

825
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:42,180
And this is the report written during wartime

826
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,460
where Vannevar Bush advocated for the US

827
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,660
to form a funding body to support not applied research, not

828
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,620
military research, but research in fundamental science.

829
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,580
I will say that the National Science Foundation

830
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:04,460
and its cousin in Canada, NSERC, have been perhaps

831
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,340
the greatest forces in fundamental science

832
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,540
in the history of mankind.

833
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,140
And I do not mean that, ironically, this is true.

834
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,340
The commitment to fundamental research

835
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,860
that these institutions have put forward.

836
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,820
I would say that even if I were not currently

837
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,700
funded by the National Science Foundation,

838
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,740
but I feel like I should mention that.

839
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,300
But this is true.

840
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,940
And this report is online.

841
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:35,300
If you look into this report, there

842
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,500
is this phrase by a chemist, James Conant,

843
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,140
in every section of the entire area of the word,

844
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:48,340
every section where the word science may be applied,

845
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:53,420
the limiting factor is human.

846
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,940
The limiting factor is human.

847
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,260
And so here is the version from Perimeter Institute.

848
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,540
Rob Myers, the director of Perimeter Institute.

849
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,980
We can't afford to leave any great thinkers

850
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,540
or any great ideas behind.

851
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,460
The limiting factor is human.

852
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,980
So you might have the best microscope

853
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,500
humanity has ever built.

854
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,620
You might have the most pristine environments

855
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,060
to look for dark matter scattering off a nuclei.

856
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,740
You might have the ability to see with finer resolution

857
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,380
than ever before the first light of the universe.

858
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,940
And you might have a damn new way of seeing the universe

859
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,020
itself.

860
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:33,100
But the thing that is holding us back is human.

861
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,260
This is the value of places like Perimeter.

862
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,980
This is where the progress is.

863
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,380
And if you ask purely about scientific interest,

864
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,180
you're saying nothing about fairness or equity

865
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,180
or any of these things.

866
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:49,220
When you want to draw people to this column,

867
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,740
you want the people who will sacrifice and work hard

868
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,980
and who are willing to do this.

869
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,540
This is a hard job and it's difficult work, tough problems.

870
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,660
You want to be able to draw from not just the 15%,

871
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,780
you want that entire 100%.

872
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,620
The power of full participation is analogous

873
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,460
to the standard model.

874
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,340
The standard model does a lot of great things.

875
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,180
Chemistry is because of the standard model of particle

876
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,700
physics.

877
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,780
But dark matter creates galaxies.

878
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,260
So let's do one last question.

879
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,900
That's how we do it, who does it, who gets to do it.

880
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,020
Why do we do this?

881
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,220
And whenever I think about this, there's

882
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,340
a painting by Paul Gauguin.

883
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,780
Who are we, where do we come from,

884
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,420
where are we going in some order?

885
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,940
And I think about this, why do we do science?

886
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,660
I think about this painting because it reminds me

887
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:47,100
that every culture for as long as humanity has been human

888
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,220
has had a story, has had a cosmology of how we belong,

889
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,300
how we came to be who we are, where we came from.

890
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,900
Right now, science is part of our cosmology

891
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,380
as a global human species.

892
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,740
And we have our own story.

893
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,180
And that story is something like this.

894
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,580
13 billion years ago-ish, there was something called

895
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,220
the Big Bang.

896
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,300
We don't quite understand what happened.

897
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,220
It's curious.

898
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,620
The Big Bang formed a lot of the matter and stuff

899
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,020
in our universe.

900
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,420
A good chunk of that stuff is dark matter, which you see here

901
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,060
in these weird filaments.

902
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,180
The universe expanded rapidly and cooled down,

903
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,660
and these filaments condensed.

904
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,100
Where these filaments overlap, there

905
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,420
is an over-density of gravity.

906
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,140
They started pulling in more dark matter.

907
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,860
That dark matter over-density then

908
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,740
had a bigger gravitational pull, and started pulling in

909
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,900
this really funny stuff called hydrogen gas.

910
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,700
And that hydrogen gas collected into this clump of dark matter,

911
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,380
and eventually the hydrogen gas found each other,

912
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,340
and they started forming these funny things called stars.

913
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,980
Some of those stars would go supernova and produce metals,

914
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,860
and you would form more complex stars.

915
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,620
Those would get together into things called galaxies.

916
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,140
In the galaxies, you find these little solar systems,

917
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:11,660
and the next thing you know, there's a planet called Earth,

918
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,860
and there are these people who are little goldfish, who

919
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,420
are just discovering the dark matter ocean that we happen

920
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,940
to be living in.

921
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,100
And that is why we do this.

922
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,140
So thank you very much.

923
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,640
Thank you.

924
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,220
Thank you so much.

925
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,540
All right, so we have time for questions.

926
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,220
So as I said before, there's a microphone there on the stairs.

927
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,620
So if you have a question, please make your way

928
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,820
to the microphone if you can.

929
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,820
I'm more from a philosophy background,

930
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,300
and I don't know if they like that question.

931
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,700
Have you heard of flies too young for the empiricism?

932
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,660
No, I'm not familiar with it.

933
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,660
Sorry.

934
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,060
Should you stand up for the microphone?

935
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,300
Here we have flies, which is called

936
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,100
the Undetermination of Theory by Experiment.

937
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,300
Ah, OK.

938
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,340
Do you want me to explain it?

939
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,340
Please.

940
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,500
The Hammers had a great influence on Einstein and Mark.

941
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:28,900
He wrote a book on the nature of physics in 1908, I believe.

942
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,100
And what he was claiming that every theory involves

943
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,100
theses that can never be reduced together.

944
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,300
So it kind of confirms what you're saying.

945
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,380
So let's say a theory how a telescope works

946
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,100
is part of your structure.

947
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,180
But the theory of light, of how that new telescope works,

948
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,220
you have to, is part of the theory.

949
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,820
So you can never go to a groundwork.

950
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,020
He actually criticized Carl Popper, who thought that everything

951
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,260
had to be verifiable.

952
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,140
And he said, no, he can never do that.

953
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,900
And he thought even basic ideas of physics,

954
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,660
like motion and stuff like that, we

955
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,740
also have to have a point of reference.

956
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,700
But everything in the universe is moving.

957
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,700
So how do you have a point of reference for all the motions

958
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,500
of the universe?

959
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,700
So that's the basic thesis.

960
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,100
So that's called the Dhamm-Quine thesis.

961
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,020
And it's one of the most important things

962
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,980
in 20th century philosophy.

963
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,380
And it's called Two Dogmas of Appearicism.

964
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,460
And what Quine was saying about the dogmas of empiricism

965
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,780
is that we have a way we, a plant had the idea

966
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,060
of the way we think of the world and the way the world is.

967
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,860
And he created this idea of the thing of itself.

968
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,180
And Quine attacks that idea and says

969
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,780
it's a false idea.

970
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,580
Because how we perceive things is then changed.

971
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,580
So the theory, we don't work that way.

972
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,660
And the things get actually mixed together.

973
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,820
So that's the basis thesis.

974
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,780
So you might want to look it up.

975
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,320
It's called Two Dogmas of Empiricism by Willard Van

976
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:53,820
Wook.

977
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,420
And it confirms exactly what you're saying in a certain way.

978
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,780
So yeah, I can offer.

979
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,020
I'm afraid of saying this in the wrong way.

980
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,180
My best friend that usually represents a philosopher.

981
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,380
And I'll say one short thing on that, which I thank you

982
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,300
very much for sharing that.

983
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,860
Part of what I wanted to share here

984
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,700
was the way in which my sub-tribe of particle theory

985
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,940
thinks about theories.

986
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,780
And what you're saying is exactly,

987
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,700
it is a philosophical question.

988
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,420
But thinking about capital T theory,

989
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,580
where this is some framework for everything.

990
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:34,220
And I think what's relevant here epistemologically

991
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,100
is that the theories that I'm talking about here

992
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,260
are lower case T theories.

993
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,460
And that's why I emphasize by the Lego analogy

994
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,420
that these are toys that are meant to do one thing.

995
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,580
And that's exactly what the answer is and why it's so low.

996
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:50,340
And actually, there's a philosopher of QT called

997
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,620
Basque-on-Frasen, and he said that as well.

998
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,260
So all three of you effectively agree on that theory.

999
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,180
Thank you for that.

1000
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,340
Yeah, so we have some questions from the online audience.

1001
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,980
And if you have questions in the audience,

1002
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,700
please feel free to make your way to the microphone.

1003
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,180
So let's see.

1004
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:11,100
We have plenty of questions from online.

1005
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,820
So here's a good one.

1006
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,860
If we found Dark Matter, what other physics mysteries

1007
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,940
would be easier to solve with that new information?

1008
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,260
That is a really good question.

1009
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,780
Thank you, person in the universe who asked this.

1010
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,100
We have a list of puzzles.

1011
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,700
And depending on what it is that we find, how we find it,

1012
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,380
there are different ways of piecing that into these puzzles.

1013
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,900
And so one way of playing this game that we play as particle

1014
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,340
theorists is pick your favorite particle physics problem.

1015
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,420
Why is there more antimatter than matter?

1016
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,780
So why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe?

1017
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,660
Why is it that certain particles have these weird properties?

1018
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,100
Why is it that the Higgs boson is light?

1019
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,660
That problem is still out there.

1020
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,620
And then you play this game of there's

1021
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,300
this new telescope coming online.

1022
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,660
If that telescope has this new ability

1023
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,220
to see the world in a certain way,

1024
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:08,340
what implications does my proposed model, my toy theory,

1025
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,580
imply for that telescope?

1026
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,340
And so there's this whole, in fact, in our conference,

1027
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,300
we had this fantastic figure, it was a flow chart of,

1028
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,500
if you see this, then what do you think it could be

1029
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,020
and what is the next experiment that you do to verify that?

1030
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,620
But the question hits exactly at the heart of what

1031
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,740
it is that we're doing.

1032
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,700
That's great.

1033
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,500
Go ahead.

1034
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,420
Can you comment on the modified gravity theory

1035
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:39,500
introduced by John Moffat that claims to explain cosmological

1036
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,060
data without dark matter?

1037
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,460
This is a fantastic question.

1038
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,460
Thank you.

1039
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,980
So modified gravity or cousins modified Newtonian dynamics,

1040
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,580
this is an alternative to what I was saying where

1041
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,900
let's all get on the same page in dark matters and new particles.

1042
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,700
Thank you very much for pointing this out.

1043
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,420
And so this is a different proposal.

1044
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,660
People have different opinions about the viability

1045
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:06,940
of these proposals, embedding into a full capital T theory.

1046
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,740
But that's all human opinion.

1047
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,340
We call it Bayesian priors.

1048
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,260
What a good theory ought to look like.

1049
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,100
What's really neat about modified gravity

1050
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:22,540
is that it is a proposal that has value in the space

1051
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,940
of understanding what dark matter is.

1052
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,300
And I'll give you an example of this.

1053
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,180
So even in my tribe, there's this idea

1054
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,060
called self-interacting dark matter.

1055
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,420
Dark matter isn't just inert.

1056
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:34,260
Sometimes it bounces off of itself.

1057
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,860
And what modified Newtonian dynamics tells you

1058
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,300
is that maybe gravity behaves a little bit differently

1059
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,100
on different scales.

1060
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,580
One of my colleagues at UC Riverside, Hybo-U,

1061
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,100
realized that, oh, that theory has some merit

1062
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,220
in connecting to experiments.

1063
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,940
That's really exciting.

1064
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,740
I have my own pet theory if that dark matter will bounce off

1065
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,740
of itself.

1066
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,500
And if dark matter bounces off of itself,

1067
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,860
the distribution of dark matter in these bubbles,

1068
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,900
in these halos, would be different.

1069
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,620
It'd be more puffy.

1070
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,540
It's like a popcorn machine.

1071
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,300
And if dark matter is more puffy,

1072
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,900
that means the gravitational interaction,

1073
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,420
the net gravitational interaction,

1074
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,500
will be a little bit different.

1075
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,900
And if it's different just the right way,

1076
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,380
it can end up looking like modified Newtonian dynamics.

1077
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,700
And say whichever tribe you follow,

1078
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,540
and whatever you prefer as a human being,

1079
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,980
experiments will figure things out ultimately.

1080
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,460
But the fact that there's this idea

1081
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,580
led to cross-pollination of new ideas and new observables.

1082
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,740
And this is the key point.

1083
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,060
What happened was the community was

1084
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,900
able to say, we should look for this type of observables

1085
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,380
in our new telescopes.

1086
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,580
And that will teach us something.

1087
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,940
And so I know a lot of the way people frame this

1088
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:52,580
is as a debate between one camp versus another camp.

1089
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,740
We're all on the same team trying

1090
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,660
to discover truth here.

1091
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,820
And I think that's a really fantastic example of that.

1092
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,060
Hi, thanks a lot.

1093
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,820
Hello, thank you.

1094
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:06,220
Pretty simplistic question, I think.

1095
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,900
My background on this is so elementary,

1096
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,020
so please forgive the silliness of the question

1097
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,980
if it comes off that way.

1098
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,180
You know you start the question.

1099
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,060
Now I'm terrified.

1100
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1101
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,900
The idea that dark matter, the candidate for dark matter

1102
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,460
that you're discussing, is a massive particle.

1103
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,300
The fact that there's like 85%, et cetera.

1104
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,580
Like instead of it being a few massive particles,

1105
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,700
what about a whole lot of really light particles?

1106
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,660
And is that still in the running?

1107
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,700
Very good.

1108
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,940
That is not a simple question.

1109
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,100
That is a deep and insightful question.

1110
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,540
And that's a question that we ask ourselves over and over

1111
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,340
again.

1112
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:47,180
Good, the mass range for plausible dark matter candidates,

1113
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:48,340
which again plausible is something

1114
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:52,340
that human beings make up, is actually incredibly wide.

1115
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:56,060
On the one end, you could have gigantic, 10 to the 30 solar

1116
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,540
mass black holes.

1117
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,380
On the other end, you could have things

1118
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,020
which one would barely call a particle quantum

1119
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,260
mechanically.

1120
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,300
What I will offer here, instead of just saying,

1121
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,140
could be anything, what I will offer here is, OK,

1122
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,500
what do we know about dark matter?

1123
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,860
The puzzle exists.

1124
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:17,620
We also know roughly how much there is.

1125
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,900
And there's one other thing I hadn't yet told you.

1126
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,740
We also know, in fact, the way to say,

1127
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,620
dark matter is cool.

1128
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,420
And not just in the hip way, but it's

1129
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,380
cool that it is cold.

1130
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:29,180
It's non-relativistic.

1131
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,420
Today, dark matter isn't traveling very fast.

1132
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:34,100
And we know that because it had to form these bubbles,

1133
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,380
these halos, that were needed to collect the hydrogen,

1134
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,860
to form stars, to form everything.

1135
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,740
So the limits on can dark matter be a bunch of light things

1136
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,620
rather than a few heavy things is actually

1137
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,060
set by, if they're very light, are they also moving very fast?

1138
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,420
And if they're moving too fast, you can't do it.

1139
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,060
So it's a very deep question.

1140
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,980
And you actually have the exactly right intuition

1141
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,420
that you can have a bunch of heavy things,

1142
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,180
or a bunch of light things, which

1143
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,740
would be equivalent gravitationally,

1144
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:03,980
to a few heavy things.

1145
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,340
So yeah, thank you.

1146
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,540
All right.

1147
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,020
Thank you so much to all of the folks who asked questions.

1148
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,340
Thank you to our online audience.

1149
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,700
And thank you so much to Professor Tenedo.

1150
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,200
Thank you.

1151
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:15,700
Thank you.

1152
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,200
Thank you.

1153
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,200
Thank you.
