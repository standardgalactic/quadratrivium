0	22600	Hi Neil Turok, thank you so much for joining us on Conversations at the Perimeter.
22600	23680	My pleasure.
23680	28120	So I have to say I've always enjoyed when I've had the opportunity to talk to you over
28120	33840	the years and one thing that I find particularly impressive about your work is that you have
33840	39520	such a deep understanding of the big picture and the goals of fundamental physics.
39520	44000	I think this is particularly difficult for researchers like me that can maybe get a bit
44000	47840	lost in technical difficulties and calculations.
47840	52560	So I want to start with a very big picture question.
52560	57880	How would you describe the state of theoretical physics research today?
57880	60480	It's very interesting.
60480	64840	It has grown into a very large field.
64840	69800	There are tens of thousands of researchers around the world.
69800	75720	At the same time I think it's diversified enormously.
75720	82720	The part of it which I'm most fascinated in is the fundamental understanding of the universe,
82720	90400	be it on very small scales as in particle physics or very large scales as in cosmology.
90400	97280	And that part I would have to say has been on the one hand benefiting from incredible
97280	99640	observations.
99640	106240	On small scales we have the Large Hadron Collider, most powerful microscope ever built, showing
106240	109520	us what subatomic particles look like.
109520	116320	And on the large scales we have data showing us the whole visible universe with exquisite
116320	118440	precision.
118440	123040	So it's definitely been a golden age in that sense.
123040	130400	And on the more theoretical side, I'd say the picture is more mixed.
130400	136120	Since I started in theoretical physics in the early 80s, there have been great hopes
136120	143120	about a number of programs of research, grand unified theories, supersymmetric theories,
143120	148400	string theory, super gravity, M theory and so on.
148400	153480	And I would have to say that these have not yet panned out.
153480	161280	It's very striking that there is not yet a single prediction which has been verified
161280	164360	from any of these frameworks.
164360	169960	So from my own point of view, on the one hand you can, you know, wring your hands and say,
169960	173640	why hasn't theory been more successful?
173640	178720	In the last 40 years, you know, all the theories we've verified are essentially rather old
178720	186360	theories, Einstein's theory of gravity, the Higgs theory of the Higgs boson and the standard
186360	190080	model have been verified with more and more precision.
190080	194080	But the newer ideas haven't panned out.
194080	201040	So you can say, you know, feel rather upset and disappointed about that.
201040	202040	I don't.
202040	211320	I think what's happening is that nature is speaking to us and telling us that he or she
211320	216080	is simpler than we expected.
216080	221440	Because what these observations reveal is a striking minimalism.
221440	223560	You know, we don't find any more party.
223560	232480	We have not found any more particles in probing the universe at very high energies now at
232480	234840	the Large Hadron Collider.
234840	239440	And on large scales in the universe, the universe appears to be more or less as simple as it
239440	248040	possibly could be and still give rise to galaxies and stars and the structures we observe.
248040	256800	So this is tremendously exciting because I think the simplicity indicated by the observations
256800	260280	is, I believe, pointing us to new principles.
260280	269120	And those principles will be deep and universal and highly predictive and highly constraining.
269120	275600	And they will constrain the universe to look something like what we see.
275600	281000	So in, you know, whereas you might naively expect the universe to get more and more complicated
281000	286280	as you go to bigger scales, the opposite seems to be true.
286280	295240	And that I find extremely exciting because it means that maybe indeed we are the scales
295240	301800	we live on and we operate on are perhaps, in some sense, the leading edge of complexity
301800	303840	in the universe.
303840	309680	This is much simpler on small scales, much simpler on large scales, and that helps put
309680	311680	us in context.
311680	319760	And maybe if we understand the big picture, the universe on very large scales, we will
319760	326000	somehow understand where we sit in the universe.
326000	331480	And I'm particularly excited about our recent work addressing the Big Bang, you know, this
331480	337720	is the most profound puzzle in all of physics, how everything emerged from a point.
337720	343360	And I think in the over the last year or two, we've really started to make sense of that.
343360	350040	And again, it indicates our new understanding is that the Big Bang is actually quite simple.
350040	355960	It's not a, it's not an arbitrary or chaotic or random process.
355960	361440	It's a very precise, I mean, if our theoretical ideas are correct, it's a very precise, very
361960	370240	boundary condition for the universe and highly principled boundary condition.
370240	379520	And if so, then, you know, the universe becomes much more comprehensible in its entirety.
379520	384800	And as you said, many other researchers work on more complicated theories that are not
384800	391080	embracing minimalism as much, why do you think others tend to stray away from these simpler
391080	392640	ideas?
392640	399080	I think, you know, we're all trying to follow the example set by Maxwell with Maxwell's
399080	403840	equations or Dirac with Dirac's equation, Einstein with Einstein's equation.
403840	412000	These are tremendously principled, economical, mathematical equations, which govern the,
412000	416760	you know, bewildering variety of phenomena and extremely predictive.
416760	424040	So we're all trying to emulate, you know, these highly successful theories we base
424040	426840	our current theories on.
426840	435240	But I think what happened is that particle theory over the last 50 years, maybe longer,
435240	442280	got into the habit of always postulating new particles.
442280	447040	And to some extent, this was natural because every time you built a new accelerator, you
447040	449200	discovered new particles.
449200	452960	And so this just became the norm is that, you know, we expect once in a while to add
452960	455160	a few new particles.
455160	461560	And the hope arose that by adding these new particles, at some point, we would actually
461560	463720	simplify the picture.
463720	468240	So in grand unified theories, for example, you try to make sense of the pattern of particles
468240	476040	around us by adding some more particles, and in such a way that the whole unified.
476040	479480	And that habit sort of persisted.
479480	481320	And so, but it generalized.
481320	489600	So instead of adding particles, people added extra dimensions of space and extra objects.
489600	497220	So there were strings in string theory and membranes and higher dimensional structures,
497220	502740	which were added to these theories, all in the hope of sort of unifying this in a principle.
502740	508180	However, the principles were somewhat lacking.
508180	516940	So string theory, you know, notoriously doesn't really have a clear conceptual foundational
516940	522380	principle in the same way that Einstein's theory of gravity had, you know, in Einstein's
522380	529020	theory, the conception was that you have curved space time and this curved space time tells
529020	531100	matter how to move.
531100	536380	And in turn, the matter tells the space time how to curve that's how John Wheeler famously
536380	538260	described it.
538260	544360	And those words, you know, besides being very beautiful, they capture a concept of how the
544360	549220	physical world works, which is very intuitive and very powerful.
549220	553660	And when it's translated into mathematics, it becomes highly predictive.
553660	559100	But string theory is lacked such principles.
559100	562980	And it's more been more a question of sort of follow your nose.
562980	568860	And when you come across some phenomenon, you sort of tweak the theory or you adjust
568860	571980	your interpretation.
571980	578380	And in particular, in cosmology, you know, quite a popular endeavor in string theory
578380	585460	has been to try to picture the universe as if it was what's called an S matrix.
585460	589780	An S matrix is something used to describe particle collisions, you know, things come
589780	592820	in and things come out.
592820	600900	But I think the way the cosmos works seems very, very different to an S matrix.
600900	606420	You know, there was a, at least in the part of the universe, we can see there was a starting
606420	607420	point.
607940	615980	And you know, there's this finishing point, which is, which is dominated by the energy
615980	622020	and empty space, the cosmological constant, sometimes called the dark energy.
622020	627980	And so I think trying to shoehorn the universe into a preconceived picture, which was designed
627980	633140	for particle physics experiments, to me seems, you know, a sort of search for a principle,
633140	637980	but not one that's particularly likely to work.
637980	644620	So I think people have been trying to find principles, which are economical and powerful
644620	646660	and will explain lots of things.
646660	651620	But to a large extent, those principles don't seem to be the right ones.
651620	659220	And as I say, the enormous simplicity of nature is hinting that there are principles
659220	661780	to be discovered.
661780	666300	And yeah, I'm hopeful that we're beginning to get on the right track.
666300	671060	I've heard you say that a key ingredient in doing this work is having a lot of dialogue
671060	675140	between theorists and experimentalists, but this is not always easy to do.
675140	680620	And I think there tends to be a bit of divide, a bit of a divide between these areas of research.
680620	685180	So how do you think we can improve this and have more effective collaborations between
685180	687420	theorists and experimentalists?
687420	692540	Well, I think it's difficult because both theory and experiment are very technical.
692540	697820	When I started as a PhD student, you know, it was very noticeable that the theorists
697820	702620	where I were in Imperial College had their own seminars and the experimentalists had
702620	707580	their own seminars and they generally never went to each other's seminars.
707580	715700	So the, you know, high level of technical complications in both aspects of science mean
715700	722260	that people don't have time to often to interact much with each other.
722260	728220	And that's, yeah, that's very sad because I do believe that theoretical physics should
728220	735020	be, you know, at its most exciting and most effective should be connected to observations.
735020	743140	And there's been an increasing sort of divergence of so-called pure theory from observations.
743140	748100	And even a sort of philosophical justification by saying, oh, well, you know, if we know
748100	754900	our theory is right for mathematical reasons, we don't really need to pay attention to the
754900	756900	observations.
756900	763220	And I am very critical of such point of view because I think you can really easily go wrong
763220	770540	in your mathematical assumptions and very quickly just diverge from anything to do with
770540	771940	reality.
771940	776020	You need to keep an eye, one eye on the observations.
776020	780540	It may not be in, you know, very detail, very much detail.
780540	784580	You don't need to get involved in experiments or data analysis or whatever, but you need
784580	792460	to pay very close attention to, you know, major observational results if you are to actually
792460	798340	build a successful theoretical physics framework.
798340	802420	So I think the field does need a bit of a reset.
802420	811700	It's particularly important for students to sort of appreciate the wonder, the sort of
811700	820980	miracle that theoretical physics is, that when it does connect to reality, it's quite magical.
820980	829220	And I think the students who don't pursue that or aspire to that are really missing
829220	836780	out on a lot, that one should, you know, never forget that the real magic in the subject
836780	840220	is when it connects to observations.
840220	842300	And these observations are extremely fundamental.
842300	847900	I mean, the universe, you know, we know things about the universe that the fact that empty
847900	855220	space seems to have an energy, the cosmological constant, that's very profound.
855220	861220	There are ideas, again, for interpreting the meaning of that, you know, what is this stuff
861220	865100	in empty space?
865100	870620	And then we have the dark matter, very good observations showing us that most of the matter
870620	874540	in galaxies is, doesn't interact with light.
874540	878700	We have some very interesting candidates for the dark matter, some of which are very minimal,
878700	880940	like neutrinos.
880940	887580	We know neutrinos exist, and it's a very simple and natural idea that one of the so-called
887580	890620	right-handed neutrinos is the dark matter.
890620	896660	And the exciting thing is that that hypothesis is possible to test.
896660	902900	Within the next five years or so, people are projecting that through observations of galaxy
902900	912260	clustering, one can actually detect even very tiny light neutrino masses.
912260	918580	And if one of the right-handed neutrinos is the dark matter, and if it's stable, then
918580	923060	it follows as a consequence that one of the light neutrinos is massless.
923060	926020	And that should be possible to confirm within the next five years.
926020	933940	It's very, very challenging work for people doing the observations and modeling, a lot
933940	939100	of computational modeling to understand how the light neutrino masses affect the clumping
939100	941340	of matter.
941340	948220	But so far, the predictions are that with the anticipated accuracy of the measurements,
948220	953420	we should be able to tell quite definitively within five years or so whether the light
953420	954580	neutrinos are massless.
954580	960420	And if that is confirmed, it will be a very strong indication that we're actually on the
960420	963740	road to understanding the dark matter.
963740	968980	And then there are other things like the fluctuations coming out of the Big Bang.
968980	977420	These take the form of quantum fluctuations in the vacuum, which is a very profound phenomenon
977420	982740	that the quantum fields we observe, like the electron or the photon or all the other fields
982740	987380	in the Standard Model, have fluctuations in the vacuum.
987380	992340	And these are very paradoxical and strange, have very strange properties.
992340	999500	For example, that if you add up all the energy in these vacuum zero point fluctuations, it's
999500	1001500	infinite.
1001500	1006620	And that doesn't make any sense because gravity couples to energy and gravity would see that
1006620	1007620	infinity.
1007620	1012460	So for decades, we've been sweeping this under the rug and pretending it's not really there
1012460	1016660	and so-called renormalizing it away.
1016660	1022780	And this is not a good state of affairs because it means we do not have a physical picture
1022780	1026860	of what's going on in the vacuum.
1026860	1030740	And again, these new developments, some of which I've been involved in, are pointing
1030740	1034140	to resolution of these questions.
1034140	1041260	So that by modifying the vacuum of the Standard Model in a certain very precise way, you can
1041260	1048860	cancel this energy divergence and, in fact, protect some of the deep symmetries in the
1048860	1053580	Standard Model, one of which is called local scale symmetry.
1053580	1059620	So it's a surprising fact that a photon of light is pretty much the same as a photon
1059620	1064780	of X-rays or radio waves, and they're all just scaled up or down versions of exactly
1064780	1065780	the same thing.
1065780	1070620	And that's a very deep symmetry of Maxwell's equations, that it's so-called scale invariant
1070620	1075940	and even more than that's locally scale invariant, so you can change the scale differently in
1075940	1082260	different parts of space and time, and the equations remain the same.
1082260	1084940	This is, why is that such a deep symmetry?
1084940	1091300	Well, to describe the Big Bang, where everything came from a point, if all the material in
1091300	1097980	the universe was insensitive to the overall size of the universe, as it is for Maxwell's
1097980	1104060	theory or actually for Dirac's theory as well, then the stuff in the universe doesn't
1104060	1106700	know about the size of the universe at all.
1106700	1112700	So even though, from our point of view, all the strength to a point, the stuff of which
1112700	1119660	matter is made doesn't see the so-called singularity, and this makes the singularity
1119660	1126020	possible to model mathematically and to really understand, and to understand this boundary
1126020	1129300	condition I mentioned at the Big Bang.
1129300	1137540	So I think these principles, in other words, trying to deal with the vacuum energy infinity
1137540	1143220	or divergence, trying to deal with the Big Bang singularity, these are really pointing
1143220	1148820	us to the right principles, which will explain the universe on large scales.
1148820	1153620	And the thing I'm most excited about recently is that using these same principles, we've
1153620	1160300	been able to calculate the fluctuations we now see in the cosmic microwave background.
1160300	1164140	And amazingly, the numbers come out correct.
1164140	1166180	We get the right size of fluctuations.
1166180	1171940	We get the right spectrum without any free parameters at all.
1171940	1179540	And so this is early days, but it's a very exciting framework which may end up explaining
1179540	1185780	the universe and connecting it to the fundamental physics of particles in a much more precise
1185780	1189780	way than we ever thought was possible.
1189780	1195500	And is this something that you have been working towards your whole career, trying to work
1195500	1198820	on these very simple models with very few free parameters?
1198820	1199820	Yes.
1199820	1204020	Or would you say this is something that you've been exploring more recently?
1204020	1209300	Essentially, I have been working with the same motivation for my whole career.
1209300	1217220	I've always chosen to work on testable theories, even when most people don't.
1217220	1225660	And so as a student, I was very fascinated by an idea of my professor, Tom Kibble, that
1225660	1228140	there would be cosmic defects in the universe.
1228140	1232660	This was actually a consequence of gran unified theories.
1232660	1237340	And what was exciting about it is if gran unified theories were correct and if these
1237340	1243020	defects had formed as they predicted, we would be able to see them.
1243020	1248460	And so I spent a lot of time trying to calculate what they would look like, what observations
1248460	1251060	would detect.
1251060	1257500	And in the end, we disproved the idea that these defects gave rise to galaxies, which
1257500	1261100	was one of the popular theories of the 80s.
1261100	1267140	And I spent a lot of time trying to calculate precisely what the predictions were and then
1267500	1272260	when the experiments came along to check, they just proved those theories wrong.
1272260	1277780	So I was very fortunate to work on theories which could be proven wrong.
1277780	1282180	Then when string theory came along, like most other people, I was very excited.
1282180	1287580	Maybe this is a unified framework that really will explain everything as a theory of everything.
1287580	1293300	And I did my best to try to reconcile string theory with cosmology.
1293300	1298620	So we made a model of colliding brains in extra dimensions.
1298620	1304700	And I would say at that point, I was beginning not really to believe, I didn't necessarily
1304700	1311700	believe this framework, but I thought it was an interesting exercise to create a rival,
1312860	1319860	a competitor to the most popular theory, which was called inflation.
1319860	1326860	And hopefully one that was less adjustable and more connected to very fundamental physics,
1326940	1331260	as string theory was, quantum gravity and so on.
1331260	1337780	But I think the realization slowly dawned that this whole framework was too complex.
1337780	1344780	And especially as the observations have become simpler and simpler and the kind of signals
1344780	1349780	you would have expected from inflation have progressively gone away.
1349780	1358780	So one of inflation's predictions was that there should be very long wavelength gravitational waves
1358780	1364780	created a sort of aftershock of this burst of expansion in the beginning of the universe.
1364780	1371780	And you could see these long wavelength gravitational waves through observing the polarization of
1372780	1377780	the micro background sky.
1377780	1383780	And the measurements finally became accurate enough to see this effect.
1383780	1386780	Initially, they claimed they had seen it.
1386780	1391780	And so all the inflationists were very excited and thought, you know, this is verification,
1391780	1398780	including Stephen Hawking, my friend Stephen Hawking, bet me in public that or we had a
1399780	1401780	bet they would not see it.
1401780	1402780	They now claim to see it.
1402780	1405780	And so he wanted me to pay the bet.
1405780	1410780	And I said, you know, all experiments require verification.
1410780	1414780	And there were reasons to doubt this experiment.
1414780	1417780	In the end, the experiment turned out to be wrong.
1417780	1422780	And now what's happened is that the latest experiment see nothing.
1422780	1429780	And within five years or so, the upper limit on these gravitational waves is going to get so low
1429780	1437780	that I think most people, most sort of relatively unbiased people will draw the conclusion
1437780	1441780	that inflation probably isn't the way to go.
1441780	1443780	So that's really exciting.
1443780	1449780	The precision of the experiments has got to the point where, you know, large numbers of
1449780	1454780	popular theoretical frameworks are now under severe pressure.
1454780	1460780	So in the interim, you know, all these things influence me a lot.
1460780	1465780	But I think especially when I was working at Perimeter and I had the responsibility as director
1465780	1472780	of sort of deciding which fields were worthwhile to invest in, that made me look very critically
1472780	1478780	at the whole field of theoretical physics and try to assess, you know, where the best
1478780	1479780	prospects were.
1479780	1482780	And of course, that influenced my research.
1482780	1488780	And so when I left as director and I went back to full-time research, you know, I was very determined
1488780	1497780	to focus on theories which I sort of genuinely believe are promising and have a chance of,
1497780	1503780	you know, providing very large explanatory power.
1503780	1506780	And so that's what I'm working on.
1506780	1511780	And I know you've said that a lot of the work you're doing now relies heavily on some ideas
1511780	1514780	introduced by Stephen Hawking, who you already mentioned.
1514780	1516780	Can you say a little more on that?
1516780	1521780	Yes, I was very fortunate in many ways to know Stephen Hawking.
1521780	1528780	When I was an undergraduate, I went to his inaugural lecture called very provocatively
1528780	1531780	Is the End of Theoretical Physics in Sight?
1531780	1534780	And it was sort of lecture full of jokes.
1534780	1537780	And at the end, he concluded it was in sight.
1537780	1540780	And I was worried I'd missed the boat.
1540780	1542780	They'd sorted everything out.
1542780	1544780	It was supergravity was the answer.
1544780	1546780	And that was that.
1546780	1551780	But it proved to be over-optimistic.
1551780	1556780	And then later, I went back to Cambridge as a professor and made friends with Stephen.
1556780	1559780	And we wrote several papers together.
1560780	1566780	But what's special about Stephen is he had this...
1566780	1568780	He was extremely adventurous.
1568780	1573780	At the time, he started thinking about quantum gravity and black holes
1573780	1577780	and how they radiate and the thermodynamics of black holes.
1577780	1581780	That was far ahead of its time.
1581780	1587780	But his ideas were so deep, they have influenced the whole field for decades.
1587780	1590780	And the way I...
1590780	1594780	I think we're still struggling to understand what they mean.
1594780	1596780	And he was too.
1596780	1600780	We still don't really know what the entropy of a black hole means exactly.
1600780	1604780	We think it's to do with how many different ways there are to make a black hole.
1604780	1608780	But we still can't quite put our finger on it.
1608780	1614780	On exactly what it means and how it's compatible with all of the rest of physics.
1614780	1621780	But in our very recent work, and this is with Latham Boyle at Perimeter,
1621780	1628780	we've developed Stephen Hawking's concept of entropy, gravitational entropy,
1628780	1634780	to apply to the universe, the whole universe.
1634780	1637780	And that's been really surprising.
1637780	1645780	And in the course of that study, I've come to the conclusion that Stephen himself
1645780	1649780	underestimated the power of his own ideas.
1649780	1653780	So he developed the idea of entropy, of gravitational entropy,
1653780	1656780	entropy of black holes, entropy of the universe.
1656780	1661780	He never succeeded in calculating it for the universe, as we now have.
1661780	1666780	And so he tied his ideas to inflation.
1666780	1671780	Inflation, to put it bluntly, was the ragbag of models,
1671780	1674780	thousands of different models of inflation.
1674780	1681780	All of them tweaked and adjusted with lots of assumptions to fit what we see in the universe.
1681780	1685780	And my current understanding is you just don't need it.
1685780	1690780	You don't need to tie Stephen's ideas of gravitational entropy to inflation.
1690780	1695780	Just take them as they are, apply them to the real universe
1695780	1701780	without any extra particles or fields or inflation or anything.
1701780	1708780	And they already explain why the universe is big, smooth, and flat in themselves.
1708780	1710780	And so that's been very exciting.
1710780	1716780	I think we've found that Stephen's ideas are more powerful than he suspected.
1717780	1721780	And there are still questions about exactly what it all means,
1721780	1729780	but it looks like they can explain the structure of the universe without any additional input.
1729780	1735780	And then the other thing in what we're studying, you see Stephen's ideas were very paradoxical in many ways.
1735780	1742780	So he said the A black hole, which only has a mass, an angular momentum, an electric charge,
1742780	1744780	just certain numbers it has.
1744780	1746780	A black hole, and it's featureless.
1746780	1752780	A black hole is essentially a featureless object, like an elementary particle, but it can be huge.
1752780	1758780	This black hole can be made in so many ways.
1758780	1764780	Now, the weird thing about that statement is that surely the number of ways you can make a black hole
1764780	1768780	depends on how many different elementary particles there are.
1768780	1773780	If I've got particles A, if I've only got one type of particle, I can make a certain black hole,
1773780	1777780	but if I've got two types of particles, surely there are more ways to make a black hole.
1777780	1782780	So just assigning an entropy of a black hole immediately creates a puzzle.
1782780	1787780	Why are there so many different particles in the standard model?
1787780	1791780	And does the entropy of a black hole depend on how many particles there are?
1791780	1795780	So the answer is, in his calculation, it's one result.
1795780	1797780	You can't adjust it.
1797780	1801780	You can't change the number of particles.
1801780	1804780	You can't change the entropy by changing the number of particles.
1804780	1806780	It's whatever it is.
1806780	1814780	That actually implies, I believe, that the number of particles in the standard model is fixed by gravity.
1814780	1819780	And we know there are three generations of particles, there are 16 particles per generation.
1819780	1826780	That number should be forced on you by the fact that standard model couples to gravity.
1826780	1830780	If it is, then the whole thing is absolutely self-contained,
1830780	1834780	and you just can't separate these puzzles from each other.
1834780	1839780	So particle physicists who are trying to understand how many particles there are in nature,
1839780	1843780	that question's meaningless unless you include gravity.
1843780	1847780	And gravitational theorists trying to understand the entropy of a black hole,
1847780	1853780	that question's meaningless unless you actually use the real number of particles in the world.
1853780	1860780	So I think that, again, the fact that Stephen's entropy ideas seem to be successful in describing a universe
1860780	1868780	indicates that physics is truly unified and not adjustable.
1868780	1877780	And so if all of this works, I would say we will be pretty sure that this is the entirety of physics.
1877780	1883780	Because if you add another particle, you're going to spoil all these cancellations and agreements.
1883780	1892780	So that's very exciting, that nature may itself be telling us how things unify.
1892780	1897780	And that all these kind of consistency arguments and arguments about the universe
1897780	1903780	and the Big Bang and consistency with observations may in fact all come together very beautifully
1903780	1907780	into a coherent mathematical picture.
1907780	1910780	I want to go back to something you said a few minutes ago that I really liked.
1910780	1915780	You said you feel lucky when you work on a theory that can be proven wrong.
1915780	1920780	And I like that because I think it's very different from how many other researchers would feel
1920780	1926780	in that situation, many others would feel very scared when they think they can just be disproven
1926780	1930780	at any moment with a new data that comes in.
1930780	1936780	Why do you think it's so scary for some people the thought of being proven wrong?
1936780	1941780	You know, it's a funny thing, but reality is scary.
1941780	1947780	I don't quite know how to put it, but sometimes when you, for example, just go out into nature,
1948780	1953780	be it a snowy field in the middle of winter in Canada,
1953780	1958780	or you're hiking in some tall mountain range or something,
1958780	1962780	or you're just looking to empty space from Earth, and you think,
1962780	1965780	wow, this is real.
1965780	1968780	That can feel scary.
1968780	1972780	And so reality is scary.
1972780	1977780	And I think it's as simple as saying, you know, I do want physics to be real,
1977780	1980780	and reality is scary.
1980780	1982780	So we just have to face up to that.
1982780	1990780	The way to face up to that is to sort of enjoy this kind of amazing fact
1990780	1997780	that we are able to interact with nature and make sense of it.
1997780	1999780	You know, we don't understand why.
1999780	2004780	It's a clue why we can do that, except perhaps, you know, we've evolved capacities,
2004780	2011780	which somehow allows us to do that, but then they go way beyond what we ever needed to survive.
2011780	2014780	You know, so we have a scary capacity.
2014780	2016780	That's obviously true.
2016780	2024780	We can do all kinds of scary things, you know, but I think part of just essentially being a responsible citizen
2024780	2031780	and living up to the opportunity of life, which we all, you know, we all possess as a miracle.
2031780	2034780	We all have this amazing thing called life.
2034780	2039780	And I think just living up to that is facing these scary realities
2039780	2044780	and trying to, you know, deal well with them.
2044780	2055780	So, yeah, I do see this, particularly among students, a sort of nervousness, particularly about Korea.
2055780	2062780	You know, people say, if I work on, you know, a theoretical framework, which A may be risky,
2062780	2066780	maybe it's going to be mathematically shown to be wrong.
2066780	2072780	You know, that's probably the more immediate danger, because there's a lot more mathematics than there is physics.
2072780	2078780	So there are lots more models of physics than there are real, you know, correct models of physics.
2078780	2084780	So I think for students, sometimes it's more comfortable to work on a model or a mathematical framework,
2084780	2088780	which actually nobody is going to prove wrong anytime soon.
2088780	2095780	But those frameworks, you know, what I would say are often very unlikely to actually have much to do with reality.
2095780	2100780	And so you may spend, you know, you'll be in a sort of relatively comfortable place,
2100780	2106780	but you'll never experience the magic that the field is capable of.
2106780	2111780	This kind of search for safety is now very common across society.
2111780	2116780	You know, people don't necessarily want to deal with the difficult problems.
2116780	2120780	How do we look after the planet? How do we make sure we're not destroying the environment?
2120780	2130780	How do we reduce inequality? How do we create opportunity for more people to live decent lives and fulfilling lives?
2130780	2137780	On the one hand, you can just sort of stick your head in the sand and say, look, it's not my responsibility.
2137780	2143780	But, you know, I think that's not, again, not living up to what the world is offering you
2143780	2154780	and the privilege you have to be part of the world, and you should play a role in, you should rise to these challenges.
2154780	2160780	So I think this all comes together. I try to encourage young, you know, when you work in physics,
2160780	2171780	a very healthy attitude often is to say, look, I'm going to try something which sounds appealing, exciting, it may be risky.
2171780	2178780	You know, and I'll have a backup plan. If this doesn't work, if it's proven wrong, well, there's so many other wonderful things to do in life.
2178780	2182780	You don't have to follow the conventional path.
2182780	2193780	And if you end up compromising to such an extent, you know, that enables you to follow some conventional path,
2193780	2199780	you know, I feel you're really missing out on the possibilities which life offers.
2199780	2203780	Have you always had a backup plan in mind throughout your career?
2203780	2212780	I always did have a backup plan. I think, you know, in my own case, my parents both went to jail for their political beliefs.
2212780	2219780	And then they came out of jail and a few decades later were elected to parliament and both.
2219780	2229780	So, you know, they had a complete turnaround where their beliefs actually led them into positions of responsibility in government.
2229780	2239780	And so that was very inspiring for me. So I took from them that, you know, one really shouldn't compromise your beliefs.
2240780	2255780	And yes, I had a backup plan. If I think even from when I was a graduate student, I was a bit worried about aspects of theoretical physics that I doubted whether these models were actually real.
2255780	2262780	It was kind of a game. People were playing an interesting game, but it somehow didn't really ring true.
2263780	2271780	Grand unified theories or string theories never really felt to me like they were a genuine insight into reality.
2271780	2277780	That's just a feeling, not necessarily one that you should trust.
2277780	2288780	But as a result of that, I basically said to myself, look, if I don't make it in theoretical physics, if I'm not able to make a good contribution,
2288780	2299780	you know, my dream was I would go and be a wildlife warden in a game park in East Africa.
2299780	2310780	That's because I thought there's sort of nothing more fun than sort of looking after lions and antelopes and rhinos in the wild.
2310780	2314780	So yeah, I always had that as a sort of at least a mental backup plan.
2315780	2322780	If nobody wants me in physics, you know, I'll go and do something much more exciting.
2322780	2330780	In fact, you know, another sort of strange thing about me is that when I was a postdoc in California,
2330780	2340780	I used to have a recurring sort of nightmare, which in the nightmare was that I actually got a faculty position back in my original department in London
2340780	2348780	that I'd be walking down the corridor and I'd see these names on the doors and I came to this door and my name was on it.
2348780	2351780	And I woke up, you know, in a cold sweat.
2351780	2354780	Oh no, I'm a faculty member.
2354780	2363780	So the academic career, you know, is not the pinnacle of human experience.
2364780	2365780	You know, I love my colleagues.
2365780	2367780	I like being an academic.
2367780	2379780	I think universities are wonderful places for many reasons, but you should use them to enjoy it and have fun and, you know, not see that as a goal in itself.
2379780	2389780	As you've said, a lot of these things you're bringing up are topics that I think students struggle a lot with and you devote a lot of your time to mentoring and giving advice to students,
2389780	2398780	including yesterday you met with a large group of PSI and graduate students here and a few of them sent in some questions for you that I'd like to share.
2398780	2401780	So let's start with one from Sabah.
2401780	2404780	I'm Sabah and I'm a PSI student.
2404780	2407780	And before coming to PSI, I was working mostly in cosmology.
2407780	2413780	And then after entering PSI, I got introduced to this whole new phase of doing quantum gravity and quantum foundations.
2413780	2420780	And I decided to somehow work in these directions while I'm in PI, foundational aspects of quantum gravity.
2420780	2435780	And now I'm at the start of my PhD that I'm really trying to figure out whether I should continue working on cosmology like I was doing before or continue doing this kind of like quantum gravity and foundational aspects of quantum gravity from like quantum information point of view.
2435780	2445780	And at this point, I feel that I found my question and I think the question for me at the moment is to like to somehow figure out quantum gravity problem of quantum gravity.
2445780	2462780	And I don't know what is the most promising avenue to somehow approach the question like when reviewing cosmology, it looks like that at very early point, everything becomes classical and we don't really know if by studying cosmology,
2462780	2467780	how can I directly address the interest in quantum gravity.
2467780	2482780	And yeah, I just want to know your opinion about what do you think about cosmology in context of quantum gravity, whether the avenues that one can pursue inside cosmology and what are the most promising ways to somehow do some phenomenological quantum gravity.
2482780	2495780	Okay, thank you for the wonderful question. I think you are asking the right question. You're recognizing that we're gaining, you know, wonderful insights from observation in cosmology.
2495780	2509780	And you want to apply it to learn something about quantum gravity, which is the big missing component in fundamental physics, the part of the standard model if you like that we understand least is is quantum gravity.
2509780	2528780	So you're asking the right question. The problem is we don't know the answer yet. And I would say the following that, you know, the sure bet over the next 10, 20 years is that observations are going to continue to bear fruit.
2528780	2535780	We're going to get more and more precise measurements of the fluctuations coming out of the Big Bang.
2535780	2556780	And with that precision, you know, we have much greater power to test theory. So I think that's a very sensible avenue for anyone to take is to get into data analysis, interaction with observations, modeling the observations and so on.
2557780	2561780	I think and I hope many people will go into that direction.
2561780	2582780	Now, I sense from your question that you are more attracted to the more fundamental questions. That's a great thing. But, you know, keep in mind that people have not solved this problem for, you know, more than 50 years, probably 75 years, people have been trying to solve these problems and failing repeatedly.
2583780	2588780	So the chances of your actually making success are very, very small at best.
2588780	2602780	So what you can do, I think is pick problems which are instructive, where you are dealing with gravity and sort of refining your understanding of Einstein's theory and of quantum mechanics.
2603780	2623780	If you'd like to think about it as a musician, you know, you we have all these wonderful works by classical composers, and it's great to practice, as well as very rewarding just to sort of review those and and play give them your own spin, and find better ways of explaining them, and so on and so forth.
2623780	2627780	And I think that kind of work is never wasted.
2627780	2638780	And so provided you don't expect to really answer, you know, these very, very difficult questions, then I think you will find the work very rewarding.
2638780	2653780	The chances that a solution to this puzzle, you know, will come in the next, I'm very optimistic, the next 10 or 20 years there will be at least much better resolutions of these puzzles.
2653780	2655780	But the chances are small.
2655780	2660780	And exactly who finds it is is a random question.
2660780	2662780	It could be anyone.
2662780	2666780	And probably it will be somebody unexpected.
2666780	2677780	So it might be, you know, a PhD student somewhere in a in a in a very minor institution who comes up with the key idea.
2677780	2683780	That's one of the exciting things about fundamental research could could be anyone.
2683780	2703780	But if you're in a position where you're studying these questions carefully and rigorously, and you are very critical, critically aware of the different approaches and frameworks, then you'll be in a good position to to respond to any such breakthrough, which happens.
2704780	2714780	And if a breakthrough does happen, whether it's by you or by anyone else, you know, obviously that's going to blossom into many, many other areas.
2714780	2728780	I mean, if we understand the second we understand quantum gravity and how it relates to the universe, there will be a huge variety of outcomes and questions and predictions and and interpretations.
2729780	2734780	And that's something which, you know, you could easily spend a lifetime working on.
2734780	2752780	So, yeah, I would encourage you to go in that direction, study it very carefully, very seriously, don't put all your bets on one horse, because whatever horse you bet on is unlikely to to be the correct approach.
2752780	2757780	And as you said, these breakthroughs can come at any time and from anyone.
2757780	2772780	And I know one thing you were very known for during your time as director at perimeter was fostering an environment in this academic institution where those breakthroughs could take place from from anyone, not necessarily just from senior faculty members.
2772780	2780780	What do you think are the most essential ingredients that an academic institution needs in order to foster those breakthroughs?
2780780	2794780	I think it's a recognition that the most likely people to come up with original ideas are the youngest people and that community of young people.
2794780	2798780	So I see the community of young people as the most important in the Institute.
2798780	2800780	Don't get bigheaded.
2800780	2804780	Those young people watching this, but I do see that.
2804780	2807780	And I think furthermore, they need to be very diverse.
2807780	2826780	I think diversity is very often a source of strength and enthusiasm and, you know, difference is very, not just, it encourages new ways of thinking.
2826780	2842780	It's a commonplace, but very often in physics, the best new ideas come about when two different strands of thought collide and suddenly realize that the other one has some insight they can benefit from.
2843780	2866780	The Higgs mechanism in the Higgs boson is a classic example where Peter Higgs was aware of ideas happening in superconductivity, which were by and large ignored by particle physicists, mainly because particle physicists were fairly arrogant and they couldn't possibly believe that somebody studying materials could actually give them a real insight.
2867780	2875780	But Higgs grabbed that insight and interpreted it in terms of and incorporated into particle physics.
2875780	2880780	And that was extremely profound and important development.
2880780	2883780	Although, you know, initially it was resisted.
2883780	2887780	People didn't believe what he was doing at all for several years.
2887780	2902780	So, so yeah, I think diversity of different types of people from different countries from different cultures, especially gender diversity is really important among that young physics community.
2902780	2904780	And it should be an environment.
2904780	2913780	I think another very important thing is that the people who often are most original are very often odd in certain respects.
2913780	2923780	They are unusual people and they're not necessarily very good at coping with, you know, the everyday rigors of life.
2923780	2936780	And so it's very important that any community which fosters talent be specially supportive of people who are unusual in whatever respect.
2937780	2939780	So I think that's essential.
2939780	2963780	And again, by supporting unusual people, different people, that's probably the best way of ensuring the field isn't a monoculture or pursuing the same direction, you know, which as I've already expressed, you know, the most popular directions haven't panned out in the last 40 years.
2964780	2971780	And, and, and that's reason why we should make sure we pursue a real diversity of directions.
2971780	2975780	No, I want to ask you more about these unusual people and how you find them.
2975780	2978780	But first, maybe let's just go to one more question from a student.
2978780	2982780	This one was sent in from bat salya, who's a PSI student.
2982780	2992780	And he wrote in asking, do you think that as theoretical physicists, it is our moral responsibility to pursue research that explains the real world?
2992780	2996780	Or is it okay to just enjoy playing with mathematical structures?
2998780	3001780	Yeah, that's a difficult question.
3001780	3007780	I do think I think above all that theoretical physics is very, is very hard.
3007780	3010780	And it's very hard to it's a kind of torture.
3010780	3016780	We do these very difficult complicated calculations and they take days or weeks or months.
3017780	3023780	And sometimes you just end up with a paradox and confusion.
3023780	3029780	So it's, it's not an easy life choice, but somehow we do enjoy it.
3031780	3042780	And, and, and so I think in order to make sense of why we enjoy it, it's quite good to have at least some idea why, you know, some idea of our motivation.
3042780	3046780	I've met a lot of theoretical physicists who like nothing more than making diagrams.
3046780	3053780	And they say, you know, they like writing papers because it's a chance to make a diagram that they can put in the paper.
3053780	3056780	But the part of it they actually enjoy is making the diagram.
3056780	3060780	So, you know, people do it for all kinds of reasons.
3060780	3066780	I don't think there's much of a moral responsibility.
3066780	3069780	I see it more as a responsibility to yourself.
3069780	3072780	You know, don't, don't delude yourself.
3072780	3084780	I guess that would be my, my overriding message is if you like playing with mathematical frameworks and if you're good at it, then by all means do it because the work you do will be good.
3084780	3093780	And other people will draw, you know, may well draw some interesting physical conclusions even if your work is just mathematical.
3094780	3101780	So I would never denigrate anyone for doing something they enjoy, especially when they're doing it well.
3101780	3108780	Even if it doesn't directly relate to physics, it's more like playing a game, a mathematical game.
3108780	3111780	I think, you know, that's fine to do.
3111780	3126780	But as, as I say, I, in a certain sense feel sorry for them because, because I think the real magic of physics is that these mathematical considerations end up connecting with reality.
3126780	3129780	That's the deep mystery of the field.
3129780	3137780	Somebody said this to me a few days ago, you know, mathematicians make their frameworks and do their calculations.
3137780	3141780	But physicists somehow have a direct line to God.
3141780	3143780	Now, I don't believe in God.
3143780	3147780	I'm not religious, at least not in any organized sense.
3147780	3166780	But, but I think there's a kind of element of truth in that that somehow physicists have uncovered a fundamental feature of existence, which is this strange ability of our minds to really make sense of what's around us.
3167780	3168780	It's a very deep puzzle.
3168780	3188780	And I think if you like the best way we can appreciate that puzzle and, and further it and pay it homage almost is to, is to practice that to make sure we what, you know, what we do does or to try to relate the mathematics we do to the real world.
3189780	3196780	In many ways you're speaking to this idea that physics needs many different people, including people who like to make diagrams.
3196780	3197780	Yes.
3197780	3200780	Maybe people might be considered unusual.
3200780	3201780	Yes, absolutely.
3201780	3210780	Maybe another way to say it is people that don't necessarily succeed in the traditional academic hierarchy that we've constructed.
3210780	3217780	So I guess as a director, it must have been very challenging to find the right people because you probably couldn't just look at the applications.
3217780	3223780	They submitted, which are maybe trying to show you other metrics than the ones you would, you would want.
3223780	3226780	So how did you go about finding the right people?
3226780	3227780	Yes.
3227780	3238780	So I think that this was something I'm particularly proud of as director is that, you know, when I came to Bremeter, the faculty was very small and they're really there.
3238780	3241780	It wasn't really structured at all.
3241780	3246780	And it wasn't clear how it should be structured.
3246780	3252780	The government and supporters had made big investments in Bremeter, and it was very important.
3252780	3265780	Those paid off in the sense that the Institute actually did good work and it became recognized as a place, you know, where excellent theoretical physics was done.
3265780	3267780	So it was quite a challenge.
3267780	3274780	And I think I took the point of view that we needed very rare people here.
3274780	3279780	We could, there was nothing stopping us from recruiting from all over the world.
3279780	3290780	And we needed to look as widely as possible and sort of keep our eyes and ears open for unusual people who'd done something unexpected.
3290780	3298780	So it wasn't a matter of reading applications or, you know, it was really being proactive.
3298780	3311780	I also learned that the senior physicists who were advising us weren't often, weren't always, or even often, the best source of ideas as to who to hire.
3311780	3320780	Because usually they had their own field and their own visibility, you know, region that was visible to them was very limited.
3320780	3328780	And secondly, if they saw somebody really good, they thought was really good, they would try and hire them themselves and not recommend them to us.
3328780	3331780	So that was interesting.
3331780	3342780	So I think the short answer was just by really keeping eyes and ears open and looking for very unusual people who maybe had unconventional career paths.
3342780	3354780	And then imagine what would happen is when you hired them, if you gave them much more freedom than are usually given to young faculty.
3354780	3363780	So one of the rules we introduced is that as a young faculty member, you should not spend more than 20% of your time on administrative duties.
3363780	3369780	So that includes teaching, mentoring, applying for grants.
3369780	3380780	And that's extremely unusual because most universities, you know, when a young faculty member arrives, they're immediately loaded with teaching and grant applications.
3380780	3384780	And they, you know, very often judged on their success in winning grants.
3384780	3391780	And I think that's very antithetical to original pursuing original research.
3391780	3398780	So I would always tell the young faculty, you know, go after some problem that really fascinates you.
3398780	3405780	If you don't publish anything for, you know, two, three years, it's no, you know, no problem.
3405780	3412780	You will explain to us that, you know, I went after this very difficult problem and we will all respect you for that.
3412780	3419780	You know, we're investing in you because we think you have the capability of doing something unusual.
3419780	3423780	And so please go after something unusual.
3423780	3431780	And you know, of course, we'll advise you and try to try to make sure you do enough to keep your career going.
3431780	3440780	But it should be a much more sort of supportive framework than is usually provided to young faculty in universities.
3440780	3454780	So I see it the job of an institution is more to challenge people to really be adventurous and ambitious rather than to judge them all the time.
3454780	3468780	And, you know, particularly on criteria like publications, citations, conference talks given and all that, you know, these are really the sort of
3469780	3477780	these are more the symptoms of physics. They're not the essence of what we're trying to do.
3477780	3484780	So in many ways, I try to set an example where perimeter used very different metrics to judge people.
3484780	3494780	I think metrics like how creative are they, how, how stimulating are they to have around?
3494780	3500780	Do they have original ideas? Do they question things? Are they asking good questions?
3500780	3511780	You know, those, those characteristics of people are actually much more important than the more conventional measures of success.
3511780	3519780	It seems like it really involves looking at the Institute as a whole, rather than just evaluating whether each individual person is successful.
3519780	3531780	Yes, one of the biggest diseases of the academic model, particularly in North America is the idea that every research has a grant and they use the grant to support their postdocs and their students.
3531780	3541780	So what you're doing is deliberately putting individual researchers in competition with one another and deliberately creating hierarchies.
3541780	3547780	And I see this everywhere. It's also become increasingly common in Europe and elsewhere, I'm sure.
3547780	3561780	And I think this, this model of the, you know, single investigator at the top of a pyramid is actually very destructive of creativity, originality, questioning.
3561780	3567780	You know, because the more junior people don't want to question the senior person who holds the cash.
3568780	3576780	And I think that's the wrong way to do things. I much prefer a much flatter structure.
3576780	3591780	And actually, conceptually, I think a much better picture is the inverted pyramid, where the senior people, if you like, are at the bottom and their job is precisely to support the younger people.
3591780	3601780	And, you know, the flowers on the tree, they can be the root, but the flowers on the tree are the young people and that's really where the emphasis should be.
3601780	3612780	It seems like a lot of the things you would ideally look for, like being creative, asking good questions, are things that are maybe more difficult to measure or difficult to predict ahead of time.
3612780	3617780	So I guess another essential ingredient is maybe being okay with taking risks.
3617780	3619780	And I'm just wondering if that's true.
3619780	3625780	Is it important to kind of embrace the fact that some of those choices you make might not work out?
3625780	3627780	Very much so.
3627780	3639780	As I say, when I talk to students today, I'm very often struck by they say, you know, well, I'd like to do something more exciting and more interesting, but it would be risky.
3640780	3649780	And, yeah, I find that very disappointing that people, I understand it, you know, they need to ultimately make a living.
3649780	3667780	And young people today are, as a sort of, as a generality, young people today are much less secure than they were in my day as a student, where I think we felt that sort of, if for whatever reason, things don't work out, you know, there are plenty of alternative options.
3667780	3671780	And we weren't nervous about livelihoods in the same way.
3671780	3673780	They're very good economic reasons for that.
3673780	3687780	You know, the ability to find jobs is certainly more difficult today than it was several decades ago.
3687780	3692780	And even my generation, it was much harder than it was in previous generations.
3692780	3702780	Previously, universities were really at least advanced research was the privilege of a very small number of people.
3702780	3710780	And as a result, they had much greater job security and didn't really worry about getting academic positions.
3710780	3714780	So my professors never really worried about this at all.
3714780	3720780	I didn't have to get grants, you know, money was more or less just provided in the 60s.
3720780	3723780	So the climate of the field has changed.
3723780	3729780	Part of that has been letting larger numbers in to the field, which is a good thing.
3729780	3736780	Widening access means greater pool of talent and, you know, things should move faster.
3736780	3749780	But what has come along with that is much more standardization and, you know, prescription telling young people, you've got to do ABC to get a job.
3749780	3753780	And I think that's very, that's been damaging.
3753780	3762780	And I see this all across higher education, actually, is that the quality of degrees now being awarded, I don't think is what it should be.
3762780	3772780	Even if you look at undergrad degrees, you know, the curriculum has become very standardized and rather dull and initiative is not rewarded.
3772780	3776780	So this is not in isolation, you know, it's, it's everywhere.
3776780	3784780	This sort of massification and then standardization and loss of creativity.
3784780	3793780	So theoretical physics is very fortunate because it's such a cheap field, you know, we just need a blackboard and chalk and occasionally a computer.
3793780	3795780	It's really a very cheap field.
3795780	3808780	So if anybody is going to recreate, you know, the organization of science more optimally, it has to be theoretical physics.
3808780	3818780	You know, we have one of the most effective of all sciences, if not the most effective in terms of predictions, theoretical physics, you know, can't be matched.
3818780	3821780	We have the cheapest.
3822780	3826780	We have the easiest, the most universal easiest to access.
3826780	3836780	You don't need a lab, you know, you, you, you can come to a summer school and learn some ideas and, and, you know, they may enable you to write a very interesting paper.
3836780	3842780	So theoretical physics should be setting the example for the rest of science.
3843780	3851780	So it's very, very important that we strategize our field carefully and wisely.
3851780	3855780	And I, I don't think that's happening in general.
3855780	3866780	You've also said in many ways that diversity is a very important ingredient and it just reminds me of something that I noted down that you said yesterday when you were meeting with students that I really like.
3866780	3872780	You said theoretical physics is special because it's cross cultural and everyone has the same questions.
3872780	3873780	Yes.
3873780	3881780	And so I just want to ask you because you have throughout your career traveled all around the world met with researchers at every level and from everywhere.
3881780	3886780	What do you think are those questions that everyone is asking?
3886780	3888780	Well, I was very struck.
3888780	3891780	For example, I'll tell you one little story.
3891780	3901780	So I was in Senegal and I was teaching electromagnetism relativity and there was a student who had done maths at university.
3901780	3907780	So not physics and was, it was kind of a lively student.
3907780	3913780	You know, so I, I asked the whole class, you know, when I started the course, what would you like to be?
3913780	3928780	And, and his answer was a billionaire, which, which actually, you know, you can say it's kind of crass, but compared to the other students who largely said, I want to be a professor.
3928780	3938780	You know, I found it more exciting to have somebody who's at least not just saying, I want to repeat, you know, exactly what the people who taught me and so on.
3938780	3940780	Anyway, so he wanted to be a billionaire.
3940780	3945780	So we started chatting and then he was very puzzled by physics.
3945780	3946780	You know, what is all this stuff?
3946780	3952780	You keep referring to reality and light and all that new writing down some equations and so on.
3952780	3961780	So then we had at some point an interaction about the problem sheets and at some point it involved instabilities.
3961780	3964780	And at some point, you know, I was trying to explain what this instability was.
3964780	3969780	And at some point he said to me, oh, you mean physics is just logic?
3969780	3973780	And I said, yes, that's exactly what it is.
3973780	3975780	It's logic applied to nature.
3975780	3977780	Ah, now I get it.
3977780	3978780	Right.
3978780	3980780	And then he got very interested.
3980780	3993780	And then in subsequent days, and this is the, the wonderful thing about meeting someone from a completely different culture and background, academically, as well as, you know, culturally and linguistically, everything.
3994780	4000780	You know, he, he started to say, gosh, you know, you can apply logic to the real world.
4000780	4003780	And then he, you know, naturally, what do you do?
4003780	4007780	You point to the stars and in Senegal, where we were, it was in a nature reserve.
4007780	4009780	It was actually a wonderful place.
4009780	4016780	And there's this huge open sky with the stars and you immediately say, what are those, you know, what's the logical basis of stars?
4016780	4023780	And then you, that was an excuse to have a conversation about how stars form and how they work and nuclear physics and, and so on.
4023780	4029780	And so, yes, people very naturally ask the same questions.
4029780	4037780	It's because we all live in the same universe and we're all sort of puzzled and amazed by the same natural phenomena.
4037780	4042780	And, and so that is the cultural unifier.
4042780	4055780	You know, when is the realization that the phenomena which are just around us all the time and which are miraculous in various ways, you know, that we can share this.
4055780	4062780	We all do share it and we can discuss with each other and share our understanding of how that works.
4062780	4067780	And that somehow gives you a grip on the world, you know, which you share.
4067780	4073780	And I do think also it makes you feel more responsible and more empowered.
4073780	4080780	And if you understand the world, you're certainly much more empowered than if you're just kind of at its mercy.
4080780	4090780	And so I think this understanding between different cultures, different peoples, fundamental understanding of the world is very empowering, is very unifying.
4090780	4096780	It makes us all feel, you know, we're part of the same enterprise.
4096780	4100780	And so that's that's really the most exciting thing of all.
4100780	4107780	Definitely. Well, Neil, thank you so much for this amazing conversation. It's been so much fun to talk to you. Thank you.
4107780	4109780	Thank you very much.
