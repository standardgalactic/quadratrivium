Бурно в Сауэфрике, профессор Нил Тарак
получил его пиадея из Эмпериала Лондона
и currently holds the Higgs Chair of Theoretical Physics
at the University of Edinburgh,
as well as the Carlo Fadani Roger Penrose Distinguished Visiting Research Chair
in Theoretical Physics here at Perimeter Institute.
В 2003 он Founded the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences,
also known as AIMS,
a Pan-African Network for training the next generation
of mathematical scientists.
Профессор Тарак has had a distinguished career,
including numerous awards.
He asked me to keep it short,
but I would be remiss not to name a few,
including the John Torrance Tate Medal for International Leadership
of the American Institute of Physics,
a TED Prize,
the James Clerk Maxwell Medal of the UK Institute of Physics,
and he is also an officer of the Order of Canada.
In addition, as you may know,
профессор Тарак served as the director of Perimeter
from 2008 to 2018,
and he was the driving force behind many of the programs and projects
that have made Perimeter what it is today.
He led Perimeter's growth into one of the world's foremost independent centers
for theoretical physics and launched, among other initiatives,
the Perimeter Scholars International Program,
which is a master's program here at Perimeter,
the Distinguished Visiting Research Chairs Program,
and the Center for the Universe.
Профессор Тарак's research focuses on developing fundamental theories
of origin and evolution of the cosmos,
as well as observational tests.
He has collaborated with scientific luminaries,
such as the late Stephen Hawking.
Tonight, he will discuss recent developments in this quest
to understand our cosmic home
and the laws of nature governing everything,
from particles to the entire universe.
He will also explain how new measurements
may soon test these exciting ideas.
Please join me in welcoming to the stage Neil Тарак.
АПЛОДИСМЕНТЫ
Спасибо, Эмили.
It's a real pleasure to be back here at Perimeter.
I had such a lot of fun as director.
Really was a unique opportunity.
And it's just great to see it thriving today.
So what I'm going to talk about is a new approach
to tackling the secrets of the universe.
And it's a new approach, actually born in a certain sense of frustration
with previous approaches.
In my view, they've become rather complicated and contrived,
including my own approaches.
And yet, the data, whether it was coming from the very small
or the very large, was the opposite.
It was stunningly simple.
You know, the world's most powerful ever microscope,
the Large Hadron Collider turned on, discovered the Higgs boson,
which was almost guaranteed, and nothing else since.
And so somehow nature has worked out a simpler way
of being consistent than theorists had anticipated.
So, same story on the very large scales,
having mapped the entire visible cosmos.
What we discovered is that the description of the cosmos
is stunningly simple.
It does not get more and more complicated.
As you go to larger scales, it's the opposite.
It gets simpler and simpler, apparently.
So, based on this, it's really inspired me to try to devise simpler,
more economical, more predictive, more principled explanations
for what we see.
And that's not easy.
What I'm going to explain is very new, very preliminary.
We've taken certain steps along a new route.
But, and I'm here partly to expose these ideas to lots of experts.
The institute is full of these kind of people,
at least the modern-day equivalents.
And this is very much the atmosphere at Perimeter.
This may be the director of Perimeter.
But I wanted to call your attention in particular.
This is the kind of role I'm playing.
This person looks like he's cheating.
I am, because I'm looking at the answer,
namely the universe and what we actually see from the observations.
And I'm looking over the shoulder.
This is an eximander, and he's looking over the shoulder of Pythagoras.
Pythagoras is figuring out the exact logical rules of mathematics.
And an eximander has one eye on that, so he's kind of okay at the math.
But he's really taken these main clues from experiments and from the world.
This person probably invented the concept of doing experiments to check scientific theories.
So that's who I want to be.
And over here is Euclid, figuring out the axioms of geometry.
We have plenty of mathematicians in Perimeter Institute as well.
So I'm going to tell you about these very new ideas.
I'm surrounded by all these clever people.
And I must warn you in advance that it could be that these ideas fall apart tomorrow.
Somebody here may point out some serious flaw,
and the whole theory will fall flat on its face.
And I do apologize in advance.
But I don't actually think that will happen.
I hope that won't happen.
But if it does, so be it.
Good scientific theories are testable either through logic, logical argument,
or through measurements.
And one has to just celebrate when they fail and move on.
Okay, so we live in a spectacular universe.
And for some reason we don't understand, it literally tells us its secrets.
The ways in which the laws of physics have been discovered illustrate this again and again.
And so obviously we live outside the sun.
It's spectacularly beautiful.
And one of the main laws of quantum mechanics, Planck's law of radiation,
that radiation comes in packets of energy,
is illustrated perfectly just by the color of the sun.
And so all we had to do, really, to figure out that light is quantized,
is just look at the sun.
Now we live inside the Big Bang.
And the Big Bang is very similar in a way to the sun,
except that we're inside it rather than outside it.
The sun's temperature is about 6000 degrees.
The temperature of the spherical shell in the universe
that emitted the radiation we now see from the Big Bang,
that shell was about 3000 degrees when the radiation was emitted.
Certainly a factor of two different from the sun.
So our place is outside the sun, but inside the Big Bang.
And both of them are shining with light,
according to the most fundamental principles of physics.
So here is the first breakthrough satellite in 1992,
that measured the radiation from the Big Bang with very high precision.
And you see the curve here.
This Planck spectrum is the most famous curve in physics,
because it's the origin of quantum mechanics.
So Planck figured this out from electric light bulbs,
fitting the data in order to predict the color of an electric light bulb.
But the sky, it turns out, is shining with exactly this spectrum.
It's based on ideas of heat and thermodynamics,
worked out by Boltzmann, this exponential law,
that the probability of getting an energy E
is given by exponential minus E over K Boltzmann T.
And that describes this tale of the distribution at high frequency.
But more importantly, energy is given by Planck's constant,
times the frequency of the photon.
And so the whole universe is literally shining at us
with the elementary spectrum of quantum mechanics,
telling us that light is quantized.
It's an amazing fact, and the error bars on this curve are minuscule.
В.е. the cosmic black body radiation is the best black body we know of in nature.
It's very hard to make an artificial one anywhere near as good.
В.е. we could have learned this from the sun
if we were able to observe the solar spectrum.
We can't because of the atmosphere.
So the atmosphere creates lines, absorption lines.
В.е. this spectrum is the extraterrestrial solar spectrum.
В.е. if you get above the atmosphere, this is what you see.
В.е. it also fits the Planck black body spectrum very well.
В.е. you could have learned this just by looking at the sun.
В.е. we just had to get above the atmosphere to do that.
В.е. here again are the theoretical curves.
В.е. this is at 5000 degrees.
В.е. it's emitting colours, which are yellow and red.
В.е. if you lower the temperature of the sun, it would get redder and redder.
В.е. this is classical theory, which is absolutely hopeless.
В.е. the quantum theory gets the right answer.
В.е. the universe literally tells us its laws.
В.е. that's the fundamental pieces of this lecture.
В.е. we have to look at the incredible array of data we now have,
figure out which parts of that data are really telling us something fundamental,
and learn from that.
В.е. here is Planck's basic postulate.
П.е. Planck didn't come to this postulate easily.
В.е. he said this was an act of desperation to try to make sense of what was going on.
В.е. if you know that light is a wave,
waves come in many wavelengths,
and you can fit small waves into a given volume
in a huge variety of waves, just imagine putting a wave of a certain length
into a box, the smaller the wave is,
the more waves there are distributing those waves.
В.е. essentially, the problem they had in thermodynamics
is that if that's really the way light worked,
if that's all there was, that light was waves that could be
any amplitude and any size,
you could just fit vast numbers into a box.
В.е. the light in the sun is basically in a box,
because it's scattering off the particles.
В.е. it takes about 100,000 years for a
light wave emitted in the core of the sun to get out of the sun.
В.е. this light is rattling around for a very, very long time,
and if it was true that it could literally
grind itself up into arbitrarily short waves,
the sun couldn't possibly exist as a stable object.
В.е. you would just grind all the light waves up
into the shortest possible waves,
and the sun would disappear in a flash
of extremely short wavelength radiation.
В.е. you need quantum mechanics to stop that,
the quantization of the waves in units of energy,
in particular that the short wavelength waves
have to have a certain amount of energy
to even exist as a piece of light, a photon.
В.е. that is what stops this runaway into very short wavelengths.
В.е. he came to this postulate,
it's what allows the world to exist stably
and objects like the sun, so it's very, very fundamental.
В.е. here it is, the energy of a light wave
is given by a constant times its frequency,
and the frequency is related to the speed of light
and the wavelength in this way.
В.е. short wavelength photons have a lot of energy.
В.е. you sort of feel this,
when you listen to radio waves passing through you
and the room and everywhere, we don't feel a thing,
but if you stand in a bright sunlight,
obviously you're feeling that radiation.
В.е. the radiation comes in high energy packets,
and that's why x-rays or gamma rays are dangerous,
because each packet of energy can, you know,
do something destructive to the molecules in your cells.
В.е. here we are inside the bang,
and as we now look out in more detail
to this shell of radiation,
which is coming at us from the big bang,
you see this random pattern,
and this was first mapped initially by Kobe
at very low resolution, but then by this Planck satellite,
and so it looks like just a random pattern of waves.
В.е. somehow what came out of the big bang
was pretty much like this, just a random pattern of ripples.
The ripples, in this case, are the density of the universe.
It varies slightly from place to place,
and so does the temperature,
as we see this surface emitting radiation.
В.е. but it's anything but random,
because, so it is, and it isn't random.
В.е. it's random in the sense that the precise location of the waves is random,
but the spectrum of radiation of the waves,
just like with the Planck spectrum, is very, very precise.
В.е. so this power spectrum means,
if I look on a certain angular scale given by this formula,
then, as I vary the angular scale,
the strength of the waves varies according to this very precise curve.
В.е. these features on the curve are really nothing surprising.
They're just the sound waves in this hot plasma that came out of the big bang.
They have a characteristic scale,
just to do with the speed of sound in the plasma,
and that causes these peaks and troughs.
В.е. this curve was predicted long before the observations by Jim Peebles, among others.
Jim Peebles won the Nobel Prize for predicting this, among other things.
В.е. I was very fortunate to be the first to calculate this curve,
which is the curve of the power spectrum of polarization
of light coming from the big bang.
В.е. the experts in the field had published papers saying that this was zero,
but we realized that didn't make any sense.
В.е. me and my postdocs, and we calculated this.
В.е. amazingly, this curve is a prediction with no free parameters.
В.е. if you adjust the cosmology, cosmological parameters to fit this curve,
then this curve is absolutely predicted.
В.е. this was one of the first influences on me telling me something.
В.е. whatever is going on in the universe, it's really simple.
В.е. it's not arbitrary.
В.е. the laws, the universal Bayes are truly universal.
В.е. if we get them right,
в.е. the laws that go in here are Einstein's theory of gravity,
и в.е. the laws of plasma physics,
в.е. which were worked out in the 1920s, a long time ago.
В.е. here is our model of the universe called Lambda CDM.
В.е. it has just five fundamental parameters.
В.е. the matter and energy content of the universe are described by three numbers.
В.е. one is the cosmological constant.
В.е. it's a little bit of a surprise, but not too much,
В.е. this was the first type of energy Einstein envisaged to be relevant in the universe.
В.е. I'll explain that a little in a moment.
В.е. the dark matter,
в.е. I used to think it was extremely mysterious.
В.е. it's one of the big puzzles in cosmology.
В.е. recently I've come to believe that there is actually a highly economical explanation of the dark matter.
В.е. finally the ordinary atomic
В.е. nuclear matter, which we are made of,
В.е. and the abundance of that matter in the universe.
В.е. that's another parameter.
В.е. on top of that, there are two additional parameters.
В.е. one is the amplitude or strength of these density waves,
В.е. which came out of the Big Bang.
В.е. it's approximately one part and a hundred thousand.
В.е. the variation in the temperature from place to place,
В.е. coming out of the Big Bang.
В.е. the radiation we see is at three degrees Kelvin,
В.е. the fluctuations are about 30 microkelvin.
В.е. it's about one part and ten to minus five, just one number.
В.е. there's a slight red tilt,
В.е. telling you that fluctuations are ever so slightly stronger
В.е. on longer wavelengths,
В.е. as you look to longer wavelengths in the universe.
В.е. that's it.
В.е. that's it.
В.е. there is no other
В.е. conclusively measured parameter,
В.е. there's no evidence for anything beyond this.
В.е. there's no strong evidence.
В.е. there's slight anomalies here and there.
В.е. these may strengthen and become compelling,
В.е. but at the moment,
В.е. this may well be the full story.
В.е. in contrast, our theories
В.е. could not be more complicated.
В.е. people talk about a multiverse,
В.е. they talk about extra dimensions
В.е. and you know,
В.е. ten to the five hundred possible universes,
В.е. chaos on large scales,
В.е. that's not what we're seeing,
В.е. and so,
В.е. I've come to believe that what we need
В.е. is a truly minimal theory
В.е. that's highly economical
В.е. it should be judged on whether or not
В.е. it explains these numbers,
В.е. that's a tool order,
В.е. I'm going to tell you about a theory,
В.е. which at least explains the last two numbers
В.е. from first principles.
В.е. what is the red tilt?
В.е. I said it means the longer waves
В.е. are slightly stronger,
В.е. to make that a bit more precise,
В.е. it means that if you go to wavelengths
В.е. which are seven times longer,
В.е. you get 4% greater amplitude.
В.е. so not much.
В.е. В.е. because 7 is the square of E
В.е. and this tilt is 0.04.
В.е. this holds over a very wide range of scales
В.е. and one of my assumptions towards the end of the talk
В.е. that would hold over a truly vast range of scales
В.е. all the way from the plank length
В.е. up to the scales we observe
В.е. if so, this is an example of critical phenomena
В.е. critical phenomena are what happens
В.е. when systems go through a phase transition
В.е. an example is critical opalescence
В.е. you see this in very strongly heated water
В.е. at high pressure, if you heat water strongly enough
В.е. what happens is it turns into gas
В.е. the gas and water, that very hot water
В.е. the steam are indistinguishable
В.е. you go through this funny phase
В.е. which has very long range fluctuations
В.е. that's exactly what we see in the universe
В.е. it's very long range fluctuations
В.е. with a particular red tilt
В.е. this is a classic example, if true, of a critical phenomenon
В.е. here it is in the lab, you see this
В.е. this is a mixture of liquid and gas
В.е. at high pressure, you heat it up
В.е. this is the opalescence
В.е. has these long wavelength fluctuations
В.е. which make it slightly opaque to light
В.е. if you go further, it becomes a completely clear
В.е. superheated liquid
В.е. I've just one example
В.е. this is really everywhere
В.е. this type of phenomenon is really everywhere in physics
В.е. it may be that what we're seeing
В.е. is somehow critical behavior
В.е. at the Big Bang, which is pretty exciting, if true
В.е. this was a very expensive picture
В.е. made by the worlds
В.е. by the Dark Energy Telescope
В.е. there is actually a telescope
В.е. sorry, Dark Energy Survey
В.е. it's such a telescope, it costs millions of dollars
В.е. this is what it saw
В.е. that's the Dark Energy
В.е. Dark Energy is the simplest form of energy
В.е. it's absolutely uniform in space
В.е. and time, it's immutable, unchanging
В.е. it's a constant
В.е. that's why Einstein introduced it into his equation
В.е. as the very simplest type of matter
В.е. which might be relevant to cosmology
В.е. he was lucky, it turns out that most of the energy in the universe
В.е. seems to take this form
В.е. the strange thing about it is it's gravitationally repulsive
В.е. in contrast to ordinary matter
В.е. which attracts under gravity
В.е. this repels and causes the universe
В.е. to blow up
В.е. there's this rather beautiful cartoon
В.е. of Professor De Sitter
В.е. who solved Einstein's equations
В.е. with a cosmological constant
В.е. and lambda is a symbol
В.е. we use for the cosmological constant
В.е. he's in the shape of a lambda
В.е. the question it says
В.е. what makes the balloon blow up
В.е. that is done by the lambda
В.е. there can be no other answer
В.е. people knew about this in the 1920s
В.е. it's a very old idea
В.е. I've introduced some of the
В.е. some of the ingredients
В.е. dark matter is not
В.е. the cosmological constant
В.е. it's some kind of matter
В.е. which clumps gravitationally
В.е. people are often a bit suspicious
В.е. of that in cosmology
В.е. why do you introduce some weird form
В.е. of matter and then assumes
В.е. it clumps under gravity
В.е. and so on
В.е. they're right to be suspicious
В.е. but actually due to
В.е. the recent observational developments
В.е. we can now actually see
В.е. this dark matter
В.е. using gravitational lensing
В.е. as the light is emitted
В.е. from this surface
В.е. the hot surface to us
В.е. it travels through
В.е. this distribution of matter
В.е. on the way and that deflects
В.е. through lensing
В.е. literally by gravity
В.е. bending of light by gravity
В.е. you see this lensed pattern
В.е. is what we actually measure
В.е. through measuring that pattern
В.е. we can infer what the dark matter
В.е. was doing
В.е. this has recently been done
В.е. just this year
В.е. another telescope looking
В.е. at the
В.е. radiation from the Big Bang
В.е. inferring this
В.е. distribution of dark matter
В.е. here's the actual
В.е. projected density of dark matter
В.е. along the line of sight
В.е. all the way back
В.е. to the
В.е. the Big Bang
В.е. so now we can actually
В.е. literally see that
В.е. much as you see
В.е. a drop of water
В.е. on your fingertip
В.е. if you look at a light
В.е. behind it
В.е. you see it by the bending
В.е. the water is transparent
В.е. you see its effect
В.е. bending the light
В.е. this is the same
В.е. the same effect
В.е. gravity is doing the
В.е. the same effect
В.е. we can see this
В.е. dark matter
В.е. we still don't know
В.е. what it is
В.е. I'm going to tell
В.е. what it is
В.е. in a minute or two
В.е. of course there's a
В.е. a gigantic puzzle
В.е. the whole thing
В.е. the Big Bang
В.е. that we live inside
В.е. seems to have
В.е. originated
В.е. at a point
В.е. it seems that
В.е. everything we see
В.е. traces back
В.е. to a single point
В.е. 14 billion years ago
В.е. that's a massive
В.е. surprise
В.е. what I'm going to
В.е. I'm going to claim
В.е. that by dealing
В.е. with this strange
В.е. that by dealing with this strange
В.е. that by dealing with this strange
В.е. that by making
В.е. a very specific
В.е. hypothesis
В.е. about it
В.е. many of the puzzles
В.е. in cosmology
В.е. get resolved
В.е. before we do that
В.е. I want to tell
В.е. a little bit more
В.e. a little bit more
В.e. about microscopes
В.e. microscopes
В.e. how we see
В.e. the subatomic world
В.e. Large Hadron Collider
В.e. the greatest microscope
В.e. built
В.e. these cosmological
В.e. measurements
В.e. are even better
В.e. microscopes
В.e. potentially take
В.e. us all the way back
В.e. to the Big Bang
В.e. this special point
В.e. let's just
В.e. talk about microscopes
В.e. is a page
В.e. from Heisenberg's
В.e. book on quantum mechanics
В.e. I just want to give
В.e. an impression
В.e. of how he argued
В.e. for uncertainty
В.e. the uncertainty principle
В.e. followed from
В.e. Plank's observation
В.e. that light had to
В.e. be quantized
В.e. energy packets
В.e. so I'm trying to
В.e. I'm going to explain
В.e. actually Heisenberg's
В.e. explanation
В.e. attributes
В.e. to Bohr
В.e. down there
В.e. one thing about Heisenberg
В.e. these diagrams
В.e. really weren't very good
В.e. this isn't even horizontal
В.e. nor does it really tell
В.e. what that X means
В.e. anyway, it's an
В.e. amazing argument
В.e. the basic point
В.e. about the uncertainty principle
В.e. is that waves spread
В.e. you can convince yourself
В.e. of this just by taking
В.e. a stick
В.e. poking
В.e. the surface of a lake
В.e. like Silver Lake
В.e. outside here
В.e. when you poke
В.e. the surface of the water
В.e. you get waves which spread out
В.e. imagine you try
В.e. to emit a wave
В.e. going in one direction
В.e. that's impossible to do
В.e. with a stick
В.e. you just use the point
В.e. so you poke the point
В.e. all you'll get is
В.e. spreading wave
В.e. it won't go in a single
В.e. direction, it'll spread out
В.e. in all directions
В.e. the only way to get it
В.e. to go in one direction
В.e. is to use the stick sideways
В.e. so with a stick
В.e. extended like this
В.e. you poke it into the water
В.e. the wave will go forward
В.e. in that direction
В.e. but of course it'll spread out
В.e. at the ends
В.e. that's called diffraction
В.e. that was well known
В.e. as a wave phenomenon
В.e. I send a wave in
В.e. to see some object
В.e. this structure here
В.e. is supposed to be the microscope
В.e. I send a wave in
В.e. an object of size
В.e. delta x
В.e. what's going to happen
В.e. is the waves will spread
В.e. they spread by this amount
В.e. the angle of spreading
В.e. is just the wavelength
В.e. delta x
В.e. so intuitively
В.e. it's sort of obvious
В.e. you can't see
В.e. an object smaller
В.e. than the wavelength
В.e. of the light
В.e. what actually happens
В.e. the light comes in
В.e. it jiggles the object
В.e. the object then
В.e. re-emits or scatters
В.e. the light
В.e. it does so in this way
В.e. that spreads
В.e. this was all
В.e. very well understood
В.e. before
В.e. quantum mechanics
В.e. but I think it's a nice
В.e. physical illustration
В.e. the uncertainty principle
В.e. this is something
В.e. you cannot
В.e. possibly
В.e. violate
В.e. you cannot
В.e. possibly make
В.e. a plane
В.e. a wave
В.e. by sticking
В.e. a point
В.e. into
В.e. a pond
В.e. however
В.e. I just told you
В.e. that the light
В.e. actually is made out
В.e. out of
В.e. particles
В.e. it's made out
В.e. out of these quanta
В.e. photons
В.e. the problem is
В.e. that particles
В.e. kick
В.e. this light
В.e. is coming in
В.e. it's actually
В.e. a packet of energy
В.e. now you're telling
В.e. that that packet
В.e. is going to
В.e. spread
В.e. according to the wave
В.e. that the packet
В.e. could be
В.e. deflected
В.e. through this
В.e. angle
В.e. theta
В.e. when it's
В.e. deflected
В.e. that gives a kick
В.e. so the light
В.e. was actually
В.e. this particle
В.e. came in
В.e. hit the object
В.e. trying to see
В.e. and
В.e. got
В.e. spread out
В.e. don't know
В.e. where the particle
В.e. is
В.e. it could be
В.e. anywhere
В.e. that's spread
В.e. that's random
В.e. that's what
В.e. quantum mechanic
В.e. says
В.e. that the precise
В.e. angle
В.e goes is random
В.e. because it
В.e. can be
В.e deflected
В.e. any angle
В.e. kicks the particle
В.e. basically what
В.e. that means
В.e. you can go through
В.e. the algebra
В.e. means that
В.e. the uncertainty
В.e. in the position
В.e. of the particle
В.e. you're measuring
В.e. multiplied
В.e. the uncertainty
В.e. in its momentum
В.e. is equal to
В.e. planks
В.e. approximately
В.e. equal to
В.e. planks constant
В.e. so that's
В.e. Heisenberg's
В.e. uncertainty
В.e relation
В.e. it's a direct
В.e consequence
В.e fact that
В.e fact that
В.e light comes
В.e. in packets
В.e. and that
В.e. light is a wave
В.e. and spreads
В.e. this was
В.e. one of
В.e. a number of
В.e. thought experiments
В.e. which
В.e. Heisenberg
В.e. and others
В.e. went through
В.e. to convince
В.e. themselves
В.e. that
В.e. this uncertainty
В.e. principle
В.e. could never
В.e. violated
В.e. it's very
В.e. very drastic
В.e. leads to
В.e. all sorts
В.e. of changes
В.e. the laws
В.e. of physics
В.e. with respect
В.e. to classical physics
В.e. a slight extension
В.e. of this microscope
В.e. pictures
В.e. to ask yourself
В.e. what is the smallest
В.e. possible
В.e. object
В.e. I could ever
В.e. see
В.e. what's the smallest
В.e. possible
В.e. length
В.e. I could ever
В.e see
В.e. So let's send
В.e. a very
В.e. high energy
В.e. short
В.e. wavelength
В.e. packet
В.e. of light
В.e. what happens
В.e. it's
В.e. it comes in
В.e. it's going to
В.e. collide
В.e. with the
В.e. object
В.e. measuring
В.e. the problem is
В.e. you've packed
В.e. a vast amount of energy
В.e. into a short
В.e. a tiny
В.e. region of space
В.e. when that happens
В.e. you get a black hole
В.e. because it
В.e. self-gravitates
В.e. spacetime
В.e. literally
В.e falls inwards
В.e. you get a black hole
В.e. unfortunately
В.e. microscope
В.e doesn't work
В.e. you can't see
В.e. any length
В.e. smaller
В.e. than this length
В.e. because
В.e. the light simply
В.e. wouldn't escape
В.e. to be seen
В.e. so this is
В.e. the plank length
В.e. that
В.e. believe
В.e. Einstein's theory
В.e. of gravity
В.e. believe quantum mechanics
В.e. this is unavoidable
В.e. largest
В.e. visible length
В.e. there's also
В.e. largest
В.e. visible length
В.e. I've told you
В.e. about lambda
В.e. how lambda
В.e. has repulsive
В.e. gravity
В.e. just
В.e. it's just the opposite
В.e. it's just like
В.e. in this case
В.e. we're
В.e. lambda causes
В.e. the universe to expand
В.e. in an
В.e. accelerating
В.e. fashion
В.e. that creates
В.e. what we call
В.e. the lambda horizon
В.e. anything further
В.e. than a certain
В.e. distance
В.e. we will never
В.e. will never see
В.e. it may emit
В.e. light
В.e. it's been
В.e. that
В.e. region
В.e. is being
В.e. accelerated
В.e. away from us
В.e. so fast
В.e. any
В.e. lighted
В.e. admits
В.e. will never
В.e. ever
В.e. reach us
В.e. so this
В.e. is the largest
В.e. visible length
В.e. actually that's
В.e. not
В.e. so different
В.e. than the
В.e. size
В.e. of the region
В.e. now
В.e. see
В.e. in the
В.e. universe
В.e. so gravity
В.e. in both cases
В.e. fixes
В.e. the smallest
В.e. possible
В.e. visible length
В.e. the largest
В.e. largest one
В.e. so coming
В.e. back to
В.e. microscopes
В.e. here's
В.e. the large
В.e. Hadron Collider
В.e. this was
В.e. its big discovery
В.e. Higgs Boson
В.e. which
В.e. I'll show you
В.e. more about
В.e. in a moment
В.e. and my
В.e. colleague in Edinburgh
В.e. is Peter Higgs
В.e. is the person
В.e. who postulated
В.e. Higgs Boson
В.e. standing there
В.e. like he
В.e understands
В.e. understands what's
В.e. going on
В.e. I guarantee
В.e does not
В.e. like me
В.e. is a theorist
В.e. spend our times
В.e. worrying about
В.e. concepts
В.e. issues of principle
В.e. it takes
В.e. real people
В.e. to build
В.e. vast
В.e. experiment
В.e. practical
В.e. people
В.e. to build experiments
В.e. to test
В.e. these ideas
В.e. amazingly
В.e. that is
В.e. what they did
В.e. took
В.e. took about
В.e. 50 years
В.e. of continuous
В.e. development
В.e. to build
В.e. the Large
В.e. Hadron Collider
В.e. when it was built
В.e. Higgs Boson
В.e. was there
В.e. exactly
В.e. where it was
В.e. predicted to be
В.e. So
В.e. this now is
В.e. all known physics
В.e. summarized
В.e. in a single
В.e. equation
В.e. have gravity
В.e. Einstein's theory
В.e. of gravity
В.e. all the forces
В.e. like electromagnetism
В.e. nuclear forces
В.e. all the particles
В.e. described by
В.e. Dirac
В.e. Higgs is very lucky
В.e. gets three
В.e. three terms
В.e. this equation
В.e. The last one includes
В.e. the lambda
В.e. want to point out
В.e. some things
В.e. you'll have noticed
В.e. that Planck's law
В.e. following Boltzmann
В.e. included an exponential
В.e. to the minus
В.e. laws of quantum mechanics
В.e. are the same
В.e. except now
В.e. there's an imaginary number
В.e. i squared
В.e. is minus one
В.e. again we get
В.e. get this exponential
В.e. with an imaginary number
В.e. here's Planck's
В.e. constant H
В.e. it's H over two pi
В.e. H bar
В.e. these are all
В.e. the laws we know
В.e. my current point
В.e. is maybe that's all
В.e. there is
В.e. there is no evidence
В.e. for anything
В.e. beyond this
В.e. the real challenge
В.e. physics now
В.e. is to
В.e. calculate
В.e. all natural processes
В.e. using these laws
В.e. it's changed
В.e. there are no new particles
В.e. I'll justify that
В.e. in a moment
В.e. key points to remember
В.e. there's an i in here
В.e. a strange imaginary number
В.e. there are these particles
В.e. like the electron
В.e. and the quarks
В.e. atomic nuclear
В.e. are made of
В.e. the rest of it
В.e. are all in a sense
В.e. connections
В.e. this is
В.e. this is a precise
В.e. mathematical term
В.e. a connection
В.e. a connection tells you
В.e. how things travel
В.e. how they affect each other
В.e. that seems to be
В.e. that everything else
В.e. is a connection
В.e. you have particles
В.e. then you have gravity
В.e. which connects them
В.e. you have electromagnetism
В.e. which connects them
В.e. that seems to be
В.e. the underlying logic
В.e. the laws of physics
В.e. here it is in more detail
В.e. we have quarks
В.e. atomic nuclear
В.e. are made of
В.e. we have leptons
В.e. like the electron
В.e. like neutrinos
В.e. the Higgs boson
В.e. which couples to
В.e. everybody
В.e. as does gravity
В.e. then we have
В.e. these forces
В.e. the strong weak
В.e. electromagnetic forces
В.e. that seems to be
В.e. all there is
В.e. now so these are
В.e. all the particles
В.e. that we've discovered
В.e. in accelerator laboratories
В.e. as I mentioned CERN
В.e. has not discovered
В.e. anything beyond
В.e. these yet
В.e. there is one
В.e. these are the
В.e. left-handed neutrinos
В.e. you'll notice the
В.e. L here
В.e. we've only ever
В.e. observed
В.e. left-handed neutrinos
В.e. left-handed means
В.e. it's traveling
В.e. along my thumb
В.e. it's spinning
В.e. this way
В.e. that's the only
В.e. ones we've seen
В.e. however
В.e. we want to solve
В.e. the problem of
В.e. the dark matter
В.e. to start off with
В.e. what is the
В.e. dark matter
В.e. oh I should
В.e. mention one
В.e. another thing
В.e. there's a

В.e. there are

В.e. electron neutrino

В.e. it's quite

В.e. why is that?
В.e. don't know
В.e. I'm going to tell
В.e. that there
В.e. is an explanation
В.e. now
В.e. it's part
В.e. of this new

В.e. that we think
В.e. this was

А это правильный партнер.
Так что это наиболее известная экстенция.
Это стандартный модель, который был предложен в 1970-х годах.
И это наверное вероятно.
Почему вероятно?
Потому что, если эти правильные нутриношки
были вероятно, то мы бы не увидели их в экспериментах.
Но они объяснили, почему нутриношки, которые мы видим,
имеют небольшую массу.
Они не массового масса.
И это значит, что нутриношки могут путешествовать
вместе с нутриношками
и transmute в нутриношку.
Это очень тяжелое.
И это вызывает много энергии.
Так что вы не можете перестануть нутриношку.
Это вероятно нутриношка.
Вы оцениваете в это,
для очень небольшого момента времени,
в принципе, в инверции массы.
И потом вы должны оценивать в нутриношку.
После этого,
и в то, что вы и мы видим,
это ст assumed.

это просто Perfect Dark Matter Кандидат,
потому что они не стремятся
к светлому или другому вооружению,
что мы знаем о том.
Они только стремятся
к гравитой и к этой хиггой.
Так что эти правильные андонитрии
могут быть Dark Matter.
И мы нашли, что мы могли объяснить,
так что теперь это начинается
получать космологическое.
Примечательно, как вы объяснили
их абонент в мире?
Как вы объяснили это?
Мы нашли объяснение о их абонентах.
Если мы assumим, что
универсия была invariанная
под другую симметрию,
которая называется CPT.
CPT — это самая основная симметрия,
известная в физике.
Она говорит, если я беру
систему, и для каждого партика
я расположу это с антипартикой.
И я вверховываю
и вернусь в то время,
что должно быть симметрия
для системы.
Но это будет
действовать в идентичной манере.
Итак, есть
CPT-симметрия.
Симметрия
является, что универсия
рассчитывает эту симметрию.
Это симметрия фундаментной лошади.
Универсия
мог бы и рассчитать или вернуть.
Что если бы это рассчитать?
Если бы это рассчитать,
то для нашей материи
универсий, мы получили более материи
универсией.
Есть быть партнер,
который имеет более антиматер.
Матер.
Время будет в opposite
направлении для партнера.
Но
то же самое,
что в размере
универсией, когда это
рассчитает до 0 на БигБанге,
это так линиально
в времени.
И если это рассчитать линиально,
то можно просто рассчитать.
Это называется аналитическая
континуация.
Это универсия.
И, в принципе, можно продолжить
в правой стороны
универсией,
в левом стороне,
через БигБангс-сингюнарию.
Так, это возможность.
Если вы делаете это,
в том числе, вы предыдущите
объемы
для материи.
О, я бы сказал,
вы видите,
это как метод
из образа.
В физике, если у вас есть
линия,
и вы хотите absolвировать
эффекты для материи
в присутствии материи,
то есть два ways
для этого.
То есть,
вы фигураете,
как много линия
выживаете в линии,
и это сбавляет
от материи,
в том числе,
по предыдущей
структуре,
и потом вернется.
Или вы делаете что-то simpler,
то есть, вы делаете
карбонный копий
для себя,
и если вы правой стороны,
вы делаете левом стороне,
на другом стороне
материи,
вы выживаете материю,
и вы просто собираете линию
от одного копия
к другому.
Это то, что это делается.
Так, это просто
метод работы
к космологии,
в том числе,
чтобы импозировать
структур,
который обращается к CPT.
Так, нет реалити
к предыдущей структуре,
это просто
комфортная математическая
структура.
Так, в этом виде,
большая структурка
была мэра,
специальная структурка,
но она довольно уникальная.
Это такая мэра,

All right and you,
but you know,
turnout in this picture you can
calculate how many are produced.
They produced this
Hawking radiation
from the big bang itself.
And we can predict exactly
what their abundance is.
There's one adjustable parameter,
which is their mass.
If it happens to be this big,
which is much bigger
than the mass of a proton,
they account for the dark matter.
And this is the simplest
И это просто-современная объяснение.
Это не значит, что это вероятно, потому что я нужна
для того, чтобы сделать предыдущие и проверить это.
Благословенно, есть предыдущие.
Если один из этих правительных нутрино,
и есть три, как и остальные,
если один из них стабиль,
это означает, что лучший нутрино именно массовый.
И вы можете видеть это с этой картой,
потому что если правительный нутрино стабиль,
то значит, вы должны выключить эту вероятно.
Возможно, это будет декей в левом и хигом.
Так что мы выключаем это,
но если мы выключаем эту вероятно,
мы также выключаем это, это то же вероятно.
Так что этот левом нутрино не может быть с правительным.
Так что этот нутрино массовый.
И так вот это предыдущение.
И, невозможно, это теперь тестово.
То, что массовые нутрино,
они теперь приобретены,
через их влияние на стабиль.
И так, лучшие галактические сервисы сейчас,
один, который называется «Нуклад», это саталлайт.
Европейская агентская саталлита.
И большая сервисная сервиса «Спейс-Тайм» в Чилле.
Эти сервисы сейчас приобретены на стабиль,
и галактические сервисы.
Они должны быть able to test this hypothesis.
Так что мы увидим, что это и правда,
если это и правда, то это массово.
Тогда это становится легко,
что это первая конвинция теории «Нуклад».
В моем случае.
Ок, так что я вернулся к этому.
«Галактическая сервиса» – это галактическая сервиса,
она была специальна стабильной стабильной агентской сервисы.
«Галактическая сервиса» выключена линиально.
Это было предназначено от Роджа Пенроу,
который был предназначен в 1970-х годах.
Пенроу изменили hypothesis,
что initial singularity,
это вещь, где все «спейс»
приводят к «поинт»,
это «конформал».
Конформал означает, что «лайк» не видит.
Лайк вверх – вы видите, что они вверх вверх.
Они все, в принципе,
копия именно так же.
Лайк вверх не знает о том, что вверх вверх.
Эквасть, которая подходит,
она вверх вверх вверх.
Лайк вверх «конформал».
Пенроу изменили hypothesis,
что «бигбанг» был «конформал».
Если все вверх вверх behaved как «лайк»
в «бигбанг»,
то ничего не будет осознанным.
Ничего вверх вверх вверх вверх.
Не будет осознанным, что есть вверх.
Потому что они не обожают, что вверх вверх вверх вверх.
«конформал» так же.
Если я беру квадрат,
и пытаюсь высказывать это в круг,
пытаюсь высказывать,
в кругу вверх вверх,
я могу это сделать в таком виде,
как я обожаю англины.
Это называется «конформал» маппинг.

Индивидуальный человек.
И здесь есть еще один из его красивых фотографий.
Пенроз упоминал, что difficulty
в объяснении, почему универсия так простая на больших scales.
Как я уже говорил, в каждом направлении, мы смотрим в универсию,
универсия практически одинаковая.
Она просто варьет из этих рандомных вейвов,
в которых амплитут есть только 10-5.
Это, в основном, очень универсия, очень асоторопия,
очень...
Это очень-очень специальная геометрия.
Это не варь и конвелута.
Итак, здесь универсия, который делает универсию
и выбирает эту очень специальную геометрию,
в которой мы видим, для универсия.
И он объясняет, что это пузл.
Итак, что я сейчас говорю,
я думаю, что у нас есть soluция для этого пузла.
Мы знаем, почему универсия так простая и простая.
И причина это...
Я имею в виду, что это оборудование идеи
Стивен Хоркин и других.
Но причина это, в основном,
так же, как причина, что газа в этом доме
является геометрией и асоторопией.
Почему аэрмоликулы так смутно выживаются?
И это хорошая вещь, потому что, если они все
выживали в сторону, мы не могли бы оборудоваться.
Они не делают это.
И почему не?
Просто рандомность.
Это просто, что есть много более
возможностей для моликулы,
чтобы они смутно выживались,
чем для них, чтобы они все были в одну сторону.
И это энтропия.
Максимальная энтропия
объясняет хомогенеи
аэрмоликулы.
Это термодинамика.
Вы не нуждите механизма.
Это просто, что происходит,
в большинстве времени.
Так что, я буду показать,
что у нас есть объяснение
для геометрии геометрии,
которая имеет такие характеристики.
Термодинамика не требует механизма.

So, actually much more than that, millions of solar masses.
A black hole has a temperature, which called a Hawking temperature.
And so this was a huge surprise that black holes are slightly hot.
It's a very tiny temperature, but they're slightly hot.
More importantly, they have an entropy.
Рафлеспеки нынешний говорит, что вы могли бы сделать это блэк-холлс.
Энтрибрэк-холлс – proportional to the area of the surface of the black hole.
Here is Stephen Hawking at Perimeter.
The Stephen Hawking Center was under construction.
He visited a number of times.
He was treated exceptionally well in the bistro, I must say, which he enjoyed.
And was absolutely inspiring to have visit.
Here he is with somebody else you may recognize,
who the founder of Perimeter Institute, Mike Lazaridis,
and we're out on Lake Huron during one of Stephen's visits.
They both look very cool.
So Hawking used a very profound mathematical trick,
which I mentioned this I, this imaginary number,
that distinguished the Boltzmann type,
the thermodynamic arguments from the quantum arguments,
and Hawking used that trick to relate the two.
And the way he related them is by making time,
by calculating in imaginary time.
It sounds very speculative, but it's not.
It's a very precise technique.
He used imaginary time to calculate the Hawking temperature
and gravitational entropy of a black hole.
Now, essentially what he did is he took the spacetime of a black hole,
which is a function of, which has a certain description
in terms of real time and real space.
And he said, what if time goes imaginary?
It turns out, when time goes imaginary,
the black hole is actually periodic in imaginary time.
It repeats itself in imaginary time.
And that's the signal of a temperature.
If you have a system, which is periodic in imaginary time,
the period actually defines a temperature,
and that's at least one way to calculate the Hawking temperature.
And the entropy calculated similarly.
So recently we were able to do the same for cosmology.
Calculate the Hawking temperature and the entropy for cosmology.
I'll show you a simple example first,
and then I'll show you the general case.
So this was done by Hawking and collaborators.
A cosmos with only lambda.
This, in fact, was Einstein's first model of cosmology.
Let's only have lambda and gravity.
Well, it's repulsive, and so the universe,
if it's a big circle in this case,
I'm only plotting one dimension of space,
so it's a circle, it shrinks and re-expands
because of the repulsion.
Okay, that's called De Sitter spacetime.
And when you make time imaginary,
the spacetime, time goes up,
the time now becomes periodic.
And so this is what Hawking called a gravitational instanton.
It's the imaginary time version of De Sitter spacetime.
It has a temperature,
which is just the length of a great circle on that sphere,
and it has an entropy, which you can calculate.
So recently we were able to solve Einstein's equations
for general cosmology with radiation,
matter, curved spatially and lambda analytically,
and we discovered it looks somewhat like this.
It's not a sphere anymore, it's distorted.
And so here's the imaginary time cosmos,
from which you can calculate the entropy,
and the real time cosmos you can think of,
sort of sprouting out of the imaginary one.
Why this is interesting,
because it turns out that this gravitational entropy,
if it is an entropy,
just like the entropy of gas in a room,
it tells you which cosmologies are more likely.
And the ones which are most likely, according to this formula,
are spatially flat, just like we see,
homogeneous isotropic and isotropic.
And secondly, this calculation also favors
that the cosmological constant is small and positive,
which is just as we see.
So this is still very new,
we're arguing lots of other experts what this means,
but in my view, this is a thermodynamic explanation
for the large-scale geometry of the universe,
so we don't need smoothing or flattening mechanisms,
some of you may have heard of inflation,
which is a postulated period of very rapid expansion,
just after the Big Bang Singularity,
we don't seem to need that.
Now, our telescopes are also microscopes,
and as we look out in space,
we are looking back in time.
The universe is shrinking,
that's what this picture shows,
so currently the radius is 20 gigaparsecs, let's say,
we shrink that region back to the Big Bang,
it's about 10 microns,
and then if I take that same region
and follow it forward into somebody's eye,
that's what we see.
So this is the largest visible region of the universe,
the one in green.
Of course, as we're looking backward in time,
the universe is smaller,
what that means is that a structure that was only a plank length,
or a wave that was only a plank length across,
at the plank time, the smallest conceivable length,
right now would be about a millimeter across,
it would have expanded to about a millimeter.
If we can capture gravitational waves
on millimeter scales,
literally we can look at the Big Bang,
we can look at the Singularity.
So that's very exciting,
these are still being developed,
it's very likely going to be decades
before this is feasible,
but there are actually prototypes already.
So, I want to now explain,
what I'm moving towards is explaining two things.
One, why there are three families,
I told you that would be explained,
three generations of particles,
and two, where did these waves,
the density waves come from,
that we see in the sky?
Did they somehow originate
at the Big Bang Singularity itself,
and then move forward,
and end up leading to the formation of galaxies,
and stars, and so on.
So, I'm going to explain that.
Now, to understand that,
we have to understand how
the standard model couples to gravity,
and currently there's a very fundamental paradox,
in that coupling,
which is that the standard model fields,
electromagnetism, the electron fields,
all the other fields,
fluctuate in the vacuum, in empty space.
The reason for those fluctuations
are basically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
If you try to set them zero,
then they're,
if you set their, essentially their position to zero,
their coordinate,
the amplitude of the wave to zero,
then its velocity is indeterminate.
You cannot set them to zero
and be consistent with this Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
This is a picture of what's going on
in the vacuum right now,
with either, like, this is actually
for the strong interactions,
but it would be the same for electromagnetism
or other fields.
Unfortunately, the energy
in these zero point fluctuations is infinite.
And that's a problem,
but how do you couple it to gravity?
So, we have various procedures
to ignore that,
but they are rather artificial
and they leave you very confused.
Somehow, something's going on in the vacuum,
which seems deeply paradoxical.
They also turn out to spoil this conformal symmetry
and so therefore we cannot
describe the Big Bang.
So, our starting point was actually
to take a clue from cosmology
what kind of field, if it fluctuated,
would lead to a pattern
like the one we see on the sky.
And turns out there's a unique answer.
It's a dimension zero field.
It's basically a field
that is dimensionless.
So, if you ask for its correlations
of this field,
it correlates on,
there's no scale.
Just like the fluctuations we see
roughly the same strength on all scale,
that's what this field has.
And actually, these fields
had been thought of before
and they were shown to be
a simple gauge theory in the 80s.
So, here the standard model particles,
what we discovered is if we add
36 precisely
of these extra dimension zero fields
and you may wonder where the 36 comes from
and the clue is that there's six of these
and six of those,
but I'm not going to say any more.
Turns out these exactly cancel the zero point energy
and they also restore the conformal symmetry.
These are highly non-trivial cancellations
and furthermore it only works
if they're three generations.
So, this is a very new discovery.
We're trying to still make sense of it.
These dimension zero fields are peculiar
because they just change the vacuum,
but they don't have any particles.
So, not adding anything,
you're just adjusting the vacuum
of the standard model
so that it doesn't have these violent energy fluctuations
and it's consistent with this conformal symmetry
that would allow you to describe the Big Bang.
Бased on this, we were able to predict the amplitude
and here it is, a big formula,
but you see it all sorts of pys and fives
and numbers, the number of degrees of freedom
in the standard model.
These alphas are couplings
which are measured in experiments like CERN
but the principles have explained
that we want this conformal symmetry
because we want to describe the Big Bang
where apparently the universe was at zero size.
So, we worked out all these numbers.
This one in particular is interesting
because alpha-3 is the strong coupling constant.
We extrapolate it to the Planck scale.
It's a huge extrapolation in energy
and it turns out it is what is called a critical exponent.
In other words, I told you there was a tilt,
waves get slightly longer as you go to long wavelengths.
This is how much stronger they get
and this tilt has to be compared with 0.04.
So, it turns out we plugged in this number
from the CERN measurements, extrapolating the CERN measurements.
The Planck scale in this number is exactly very close to 0.04.
So, our prediction is 0.042.
This is the measurement from the Planck satellite.
So, that's just a first principles explanation.
A lot more theoretical work is needed
to confirm this, to calculate corrections,
make sure they're under control.
Observations are also improving.
If this agreement holds up,
then the theory will become compelling.
So, it may be that we have an explanation of all this.
It's all basically in the physics we know,
is that we have to do something to fix up the vacuum a little,
but otherwise cosmology is all under control.
So, thank you for listening.
АПЛОДИСМЕНТЫ
Alright, thank you, Neil.
So captivated.
I almost forgot to stand up to do the Q&A.
So, we will now take some questions,
both from the online audience and from the audience here.
If you have a question, please come down to the microphone
that is set up here on the stairs.
And we'll just go with the Q
and I'll bring up the online questions as well.
So, if you're online listening,
you can add a question with the hashtag PI live.
So, we'll start while we let people come down.
We'll start with an online question.
So, let's see, what do we have?
Here's one.
So, I think this is a fun one to start with.
Would the mirror universe be an identical reflection to this one
with a mirror Earth moving,
with a mirror Neil Tarak giving a mirror lecture?
No.
So, the thing is, you've got to clearly distinguish classical from quantum.
Now, a quantum geometry is a fluctuating thing.
So, when I draw this geometry,
you shouldn't really picture a single geometry.
You need to picture something that's a bit fuzzy.
And it gets more and more fuzzy near the singularity.
When the universe is small,
that fuzziness means that could sort of,
could quote singularity, could actually be moved around.
There's some fuzziness.
The way you impose the CPT symmetry is where the universe is large.
So, if you like, there's a two-sided universe going out on either side.
You impose a symmetry that if I turn the whole thing around,
there's no difference.
In both cases, there are fluctuations.
So, it's really the CPT symmetry is a quantum symmetry.
You shouldn't think literally that the two sides are carbon copies of each other.
So, I think of it more as a sort of mathematical device
to do something sensible with the singularity.
And you don't do it at the singularity.
Instead, you picture this extended spacetime
and impose a symmetry on that.
If you flip it around, that's what you do.
Thanks.
All right, we have a question from the audience.
Go ahead.

Пожалуйста, спасибо за это.
Я должен сказать, что один из самых замечательных
Meetings, которые я видел,
были между Стивен Хоркин и Сидней Пватиэ,
который, конечно, был легендарным актером.
И они сидели на столе с другом.
И Сидни сказал, что я думаю, что у нас есть.
И Сидни, действительно, Had his own theory.
Он не знал математики и так далее.
Но он абсолютно видел, как он думал, что надо работать.
И это было просто абсолютно fascinating,
видеть пасшену, с которой он сообщил.
И Стивен был довольно встанутым с Сидней.
Мы все имеем наши фотографии.
И она абсолютно права.
Это ничего, но история.
Все физики — это просто история.
Кто-то в нашем конференции, в этом вечере,
очень хорошо сказал, что это narrative.
Физика — это narrative.
Это что-то, что мы говорим о том,
о том, как мир behaving.
Истороннее, что о физике,
это narrative converges.
Мы можем использовать это.
И это у нас невероятная мощь.
Но в конце концов, это просто история.
Отлично.
У нас есть еще один вопрос от audiences.
Спасибо, профессор Турак, за поговоре.
У меня два вопроса.
Один вопрос — когда мы думаем о том,
что Биг-Банг происходит 13.8 миллионов лет назад,
кажется, что революция говорит нам, что время relative.
Так что, может Биг-Банг быть визжанным
как что-то, которое постоянно происходит,
как у нас есть своя своя своя спина?
Как у нас есть постоянный феномен.
Как вы говорите в начале,
кажется, что это 14 миллионов лет назад,
но это у нас есть своя своя своя спина.
Ну, когда мы говорим о 14 миллион лет назад,
то это, как мы говорили,
hours,
hours,
hours…
45%
An hour,
40%
An hour,
40%
сингулярность, это 13.7 миллионов лет, но я не уверен, что я fully understand the question,
но это точно вероятно, что время в General relativity is, you know, is different objects,
different observers see different times, но это мы, вы знаете, мы понимаем, мы
believe that at the end of the story is remarkably simple.
Что кажется, что сингулярность в Бигбанге, это notion of time, я mean,
if this picture is correct, то notion of time becomes meaningless, почему?
Потому что все это становится светлым, литерально то, что есть свет,
свет не видит экспансион в мире, свет не видит время, если
ты asks a photon what's the time, a photon will tell you I see the whole universe all of existence
simultaneous, ок, so photons are pretty amazing things, which have no time,
no notion of time, and that seems to be, if this is right, how you deal with the singularity,
there was no time at the Big Bang, or at least there was nothing around to witness the time.
Thank you, and just because you had that sort of the expansion on like the universe that we
observe in your sort of universe, sort of mirror model, and I think Penrose had developed the
conformal cosmic psychology, so I mean, I don't know if that makes any sense from your model,
but as the universe becomes all black holes, and then the radiation and heat death, would that be
where it connects on, like it connects in the middle, but would it connect to the universe at the heat death?
No, I mean, I have the greatest possible respect for Penrose's ideas, and as I indicated,
what we're connecting it is an idea of his from the 70s, which is about the singularity.
Since then, he started to advocate this cyclic universe picture, I think partly influenced by myself
and Paul Steinhardt, because we talked about cyclic, whereas I've abandoned that, it's too complicated,
he is now advocating it, but the problem is that he doesn't really have a way to match
the future of our universe to the big bang of the next one.
He doesn't have a mathematical prescription for how you, he has a prescription, but it doesn't really work,
and yeah, it's, whereas what we're doing here is this, is called analytic, it means that it's unique,
the connection between these two sides, so, but, you know, we're in discussion about it,
I'm trying to persuade him that your previous idea was much better than this one,
but we'll see, I mean, it could well be that he turns out to be right, he has turned out to be right on
very, very many things. Thank you.
Thank you. All right, we have another question.
Thank you very much for the nice talk. I was wondering about one remark, which you made,
about the production of the right-handed neutrinos, and so if I understood it correctly,
it would be like a Hawking radiation effect from the early universe, and normally Hawking
radiation is associated with some kind of horizon, or some cosmological horizon.
If we are now in this regime of very early times and the scale factor is linear,
there's no horizon. Yes, so I met, okay, so it's, it's good you ask. So at some level,
it's totally obvious to suggest the right-handed neutrinos, the dark matter,
because it doesn't couple to light or other forces. Why wasn't this done in the 70s?
And the reason was that everybody thought that the abundance of particles are determined by thermal
equilibrium in the hot big bang. If you switch off this coupling so that it's stable and can be
the dark matter, it was never in thermal equilibrium, so they didn't know how to calculate its abundance,
so they assumed that wasn't the case. And literally, they made the assumption
just so they didn't have to worry about it, okay. Now, so we did worry about it,
because we wanted it to be the dark matter. And, and then when I said Hawking radiation,
what I really meant is it's the time dependence of the cosmology that creates the particles.
So it's not with a horizon, with a black hole, it's associated with a horizon.
But in general, if space changes, the scale factor changes, you produce particles.
It's much more general than having a horizon. And in this case, that's what happens. It's just the,
the mere fact the universe is changing in size, creates a particle. Thank you.
All right, we have time for a couple more questions. Go ahead.
Hi there. You had mentioned that an explanation for dark matter could be right-handed neutrinos.
Yes. But that relied on a left-handed neutrino being massless.
Yes. My question to you is, have we not measured the mass of a left-handed neutrino to be nonzero?
No, great question. So what has been measured, there are three neutrinos,
three light neutrinos, we know of. The only things that have been measured are the differences
in actually the squares of the masses of those three neutrinos. So we know two numbers.
We know essentially two differences between the light neutrino masses.
We do not know the overall scale. So our prediction is that we have these three masses
and the lightest one is massless. So we predict all the masses from that, from the known measurements.
And what these galaxy surveys are going to do in the next three to five years is
fix the sum of these neutrino masses. So if they find the sum is essentially
just the sum of those two differences, then it will confirm that the lightest one is massless.
Thank you. That's a great question. All right, let's take one final question from the audience.
Thank you for the lecture. It was amazing. My question is just, you were talking about these sort of
mirror, this sort of mirror universe that is similar to ours at cosmological scales,
but not identical because of fluctuations close to the Big Bang. Feynman sort of had this idea of
electrons and positrons being not separate particles, but merely the same particle traveling in
different directions in time. Could those particles travel between our universe and this
mirror universe through the singularity because, you know, to positron and electron collide?
It's a great question. There is this very fundamental view of antimatter as just being matter that's
struggling backwards in time. And in fact, Feynman, the greatest expert on all this, made the statement
that he believed quantum field theory, which is what we use to describe the standard model,
was nothing but a way of hiding the fact that particles go backwards in time.
So, indeed, this CPT is, you see, if I have a particle traveling from A to B with a world line
from it, and that, let's imagine, time goes up and space sideways. So this, the particle can go
forwards and backwards in time and so on. What is CPT? It's just reversing the arrow on that line.
So instead of going from here to there, it goes from here to there, that's CPT.
And, indeed, that must be possible. Okay, so somehow we're doing the same thing with the cosmos,
but one way of picturing this two-sided diagram is that it's really a U-shape
and you can imagine a universe going backwards in time for a while and then turning around and going forwards.
Реконсайлинг these pictures of the particles and the universe is something we still have not done
and it should be fruitful, but I don't quite know how to do it yet.
Still working on it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, you have a quick question? Okay, yep.
I was sitting there and I was thinking,
this is very complex and I can understand why you haven't come back from
Britain because you were having too much fun, but I'm thinking that
if we start from the very basics, existence, what is existence?
How did it, how did it appear? I mean, we're sort of going after the second step
of looking at the ball bearings in the world. No, you're absolutely right.
The more basic the question, the harder it is to answer.
So all physics is doing is sort of following our nose and trying to figure out
what might we learn next, but the motivation is exactly what you say.
We're trying to understand what the hell is going on in a very big sense.
Why is there existence? We don't know. The best we can do is...
That should hint to what all these molecules and everything is about.
It would be called enlightenment.
That's a lovely thought to end on, so thank you very much, Neil.
