Сейчас мы будем пzyć познание slopes.

10
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,020
как мы делаем сегодня, чтобы спрашивать большие вопросы о мире и спрятать за большие ответы.

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,940
Париметр скоро прожитает 25 годов, приводя людей из всех паттах вместе,

12
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,940
ученые, студенты, ученые и генерал-публики,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,940
чтобы изучить фанатичный мир физики.

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,420
Но люди на этой стране спрашивают большие вопросы о мире за тысячи лет,

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,980
взглянуть на небо и понимать, что наш место в космос

16
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,140
является основным константином в этом мире.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,500
Мы игнорируем, что париметр находится на традиционной территории

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,780
от Анашинабе, Ходнышоне и Нутрии,

19
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,820
и находится на халдуме Тракт,

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,460

что мы перестанем провести уникальные конференции,

33
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,580
называемые Пузыльами в Ландске Квантума Гравити,

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,540
который приводит вместе эксперты в космологию,

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,820
лекарственные физики,

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,060
эффективные гравитационные теории и гравитанские теории.

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,020
Университет находится с более чем 125 артистов,

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,460
и много больше, учащихся в виртуальности в мире.

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
И сейчас.

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,500
Это мой великолепный праздник,

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,540
чтобы introduction of one of those conference attendees

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,100
and our speaker for tonight,

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,660
someone who may be familiar to many of you.

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,020
Бурно в Сауэфрике, профессор Нил Тарак

45
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,260
получил его пиадея из Эмпериала Лондона

46
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,980
и currently holds the Higgs Chair of Theoretical Physics

47
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,500
at the University of Edinburgh,

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
as well as the Carlo Fadani Roger Penrose Distinguished Visiting Research Chair

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,020
in Theoretical Physics here at Perimeter Institute.

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,980
В 2003 он Founded the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences,

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,420
also known as AIMS,

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,300
a Pan-African Network for training the next generation

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,500
of mathematical scientists.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,900
Профессор Тарак has had a distinguished career,

55
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,660
including numerous awards.

56
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,220
He asked me to keep it short,

57
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,100
but I would be remiss not to name a few,

58
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,140
including the John Torrance Tate Medal for International Leadership

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,020
of the American Institute of Physics,

60
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,340
a TED Prize,

61
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,540
the James Clerk Maxwell Medal of the UK Institute of Physics,

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,980
and he is also an officer of the Order of Canada.

63
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,860
In addition, as you may know,

64
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,460
профессор Тарак served as the director of Perimeter

65
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,580
from 2008 to 2018,

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,060
and he was the driving force behind many of the programs and projects

67
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,620
that have made Perimeter what it is today.

68
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,620
He led Perimeter's growth into one of the world's foremost independent centers

69
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,860
for theoretical physics and launched, among other initiatives,

70
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,060
the Perimeter Scholars International Program,

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,420
which is a master's program here at Perimeter,

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,060
the Distinguished Visiting Research Chairs Program,

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,100
and the Center for the Universe.

74
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,420
Профессор Тарак's research focuses on developing fundamental theories

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
of origin and evolution of the cosmos,

76
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,500
as well as observational tests.

77
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,380
He has collaborated with scientific luminaries,

78
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,380
such as the late Stephen Hawking.

79
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,460
Tonight, he will discuss recent developments in this quest

80
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,620
to understand our cosmic home

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,900
and the laws of nature governing everything,

82
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,380
from particles to the entire universe.

83
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,060
He will also explain how new measurements

84
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,820
may soon test these exciting ideas.

85
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,660
Please join me in welcoming to the stage Neil Тарак.

86
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:38,140
АПЛОДИСМЕНТЫ

87
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,260
Спасибо, Эмили.

88
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,980
It's a real pleasure to be back here at Perimeter.

89
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,220
I had such a lot of fun as director.

90
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,860
Really was a unique opportunity.

91
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,980
And it's just great to see it thriving today.

92
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,540
So what I'm going to talk about is a new approach

93
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,380
to tackling the secrets of the universe.

94
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,020
And it's a new approach, actually born in a certain sense of frustration

95
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,700
with previous approaches.

96
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,060
In my view, they've become rather complicated and contrived,

97
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,500
including my own approaches.

98
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,060
And yet, the data, whether it was coming from the very small

99
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,660
or the very large, was the opposite.

100
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,620
It was stunningly simple.

101
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,060
You know, the world's most powerful ever microscope,

102
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,380
the Large Hadron Collider turned on, discovered the Higgs boson,

103
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,940
which was almost guaranteed, and nothing else since.

104
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,140
And so somehow nature has worked out a simpler way

105
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,500
of being consistent than theorists had anticipated.

106
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,300
So, same story on the very large scales,

107
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,220
having mapped the entire visible cosmos.

108
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,460
What we discovered is that the description of the cosmos

109
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,460
is stunningly simple.

110
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,700
It does not get more and more complicated.

111
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,940
As you go to larger scales, it's the opposite.

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,060
It gets simpler and simpler, apparently.

113
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:15,220
So, based on this, it's really inspired me to try to devise simpler,

114
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,820
more economical, more predictive, more principled explanations

115
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,500
for what we see.

116
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,700
And that's not easy.

117
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,100
What I'm going to explain is very new, very preliminary.

118
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,260
We've taken certain steps along a new route.

119
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,820
But, and I'm here partly to expose these ideas to lots of experts.

120
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,460
The institute is full of these kind of people,

121
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,260
at least the modern-day equivalents.

122
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,300
And this is very much the atmosphere at Perimeter.

123
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,780
This may be the director of Perimeter.

124
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,460
But I wanted to call your attention in particular.

125
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,620
This is the kind of role I'm playing.

126
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,780
This person looks like he's cheating.

127
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,140
I am, because I'm looking at the answer,

128
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,060
namely the universe and what we actually see from the observations.

129
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,420
And I'm looking over the shoulder.

130
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,340
This is an eximander, and he's looking over the shoulder of Pythagoras.

131
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:25,740
Pythagoras is figuring out the exact logical rules of mathematics.

132
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,300
And an eximander has one eye on that, so he's kind of okay at the math.

133
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,780
But he's really taken these main clues from experiments and from the world.

134
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:43,740
This person probably invented the concept of doing experiments to check scientific theories.

135
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,980
So that's who I want to be.

136
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,660
And over here is Euclid, figuring out the axioms of geometry.

137
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,140
We have plenty of mathematicians in Perimeter Institute as well.

138
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,380
So I'm going to tell you about these very new ideas.

139
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,700
I'm surrounded by all these clever people.

140
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,740
And I must warn you in advance that it could be that these ideas fall apart tomorrow.

141
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,100
Somebody here may point out some serious flaw,

142
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,860
and the whole theory will fall flat on its face.

143
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,500
And I do apologize in advance.

144
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,820
But I don't actually think that will happen.

145
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,660
I hope that won't happen.

146
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,300
But if it does, so be it.

147
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,980
Good scientific theories are testable either through logic, logical argument,

148
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,220
or through measurements.

149
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:47,100
And one has to just celebrate when they fail and move on.

150
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,580
Okay, so we live in a spectacular universe.

151
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,300
And for some reason we don't understand, it literally tells us its secrets.

152
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:04,660
The ways in which the laws of physics have been discovered illustrate this again and again.

153
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,660
And so obviously we live outside the sun.

154
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,940
It's spectacularly beautiful.

155
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,980
And one of the main laws of quantum mechanics, Planck's law of radiation,

156
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,100
that radiation comes in packets of energy,

157
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,980
is illustrated perfectly just by the color of the sun.

158
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,020
And so all we had to do, really, to figure out that light is quantized,

159
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,100
is just look at the sun.

160
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,620
Now we live inside the Big Bang.

161
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,860
And the Big Bang is very similar in a way to the sun,

162
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,620
except that we're inside it rather than outside it.

163
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,500
The sun's temperature is about 6000 degrees.

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,860
The temperature of the spherical shell in the universe

165
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,260
that emitted the radiation we now see from the Big Bang,

166
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,740
that shell was about 3000 degrees when the radiation was emitted.

167
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,300
Certainly a factor of two different from the sun.

168
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,540
So our place is outside the sun, but inside the Big Bang.

169
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,980
And both of them are shining with light,

170
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,060
according to the most fundamental principles of physics.

171
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,620
So here is the first breakthrough satellite in 1992,

172
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,620
that measured the radiation from the Big Bang with very high precision.

173
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,900
And you see the curve here.

174
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,300
This Planck spectrum is the most famous curve in physics,

175
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,820
because it's the origin of quantum mechanics.

176
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,420
So Planck figured this out from electric light bulbs,

177
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,700
fitting the data in order to predict the color of an electric light bulb.

178
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,780
But the sky, it turns out, is shining with exactly this spectrum.

179
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,180
It's based on ideas of heat and thermodynamics,

180
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,020
worked out by Boltzmann, this exponential law,

181
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,740
that the probability of getting an energy E

182
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,140
is given by exponential minus E over K Boltzmann T.

183
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,860
And that describes this tale of the distribution at high frequency.

184
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,460
But more importantly, energy is given by Planck's constant,

185
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,580
times the frequency of the photon.

186
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,940
And so the whole universe is literally shining at us

187
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,500
with the elementary spectrum of quantum mechanics,

188
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,100
telling us that light is quantized.

189
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,940
It's an amazing fact, and the error bars on this curve are minuscule.

190
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:50,660
В.е. the cosmic black body radiation is the best black body we know of in nature.

191
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,980
It's very hard to make an artificial one anywhere near as good.

192
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,260
В.е. we could have learned this from the sun

193
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,300
if we were able to observe the solar spectrum.

194
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,540
We can't because of the atmosphere.

195
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,540
So the atmosphere creates lines, absorption lines.

196
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,620
В.е. this spectrum is the extraterrestrial solar spectrum.

197
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,900
В.е. if you get above the atmosphere, this is what you see.

198
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,180
В.е. it also fits the Planck black body spectrum very well.

199
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,860
В.е. you could have learned this just by looking at the sun.

200
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,180
В.е. we just had to get above the atmosphere to do that.

201
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,300
В.е. here again are the theoretical curves.

202
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,460
В.е. this is at 5000 degrees.

203
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,500
В.е. it's emitting colours, which are yellow and red.

204
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,220
В.е. if you lower the temperature of the sun, it would get redder and redder.

205
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,540
В.е. this is classical theory, which is absolutely hopeless.

206
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,540
В.е. the quantum theory gets the right answer.

207
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:59,900
В.е. the universe literally tells us its laws.

208
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,340
В.е. that's the fundamental pieces of this lecture.

209
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,780
В.е. we have to look at the incredible array of data we now have,

210
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,500
figure out which parts of that data are really telling us something fundamental,

211
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,940
and learn from that.

212
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,260
В.е. here is Planck's basic postulate.

213
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,020
П.е. Planck didn't come to this postulate easily.

214
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:31,380
В.е. he said this was an act of desperation to try to make sense of what was going on.

215
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,940
В.е. if you know that light is a wave,

216
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,780
waves come in many wavelengths,

217
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,740
and you can fit small waves into a given volume

218
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:52,900
in a huge variety of waves, just imagine putting a wave of a certain length

219
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,660
into a box, the smaller the wave is,

220
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,420
the more waves there are distributing those waves.

221
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,660
В.е. essentially, the problem they had in thermodynamics

222
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,060
is that if that's really the way light worked,

223
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,300
if that's all there was, that light was waves that could be

224
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,580
any amplitude and any size,

225
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,780
you could just fit vast numbers into a box.

226
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,380
В.е. the light in the sun is basically in a box,

227
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,820
because it's scattering off the particles.

228
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,220
В.е. it takes about 100,000 years for a

229
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,820
light wave emitted in the core of the sun to get out of the sun.

230
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,420
В.е. this light is rattling around for a very, very long time,

231
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,500
and if it was true that it could literally

232
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,620
grind itself up into arbitrarily short waves,

233
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,100
the sun couldn't possibly exist as a stable object.

234
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,220
В.е. you would just grind all the light waves up

235
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,540
into the shortest possible waves,

236
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,980
and the sun would disappear in a flash

237
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,100
of extremely short wavelength radiation.

238
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,540
В.е. you need quantum mechanics to stop that,

239
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,340
the quantization of the waves in units of energy,

240
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:13,700
in particular that the short wavelength waves

241
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,740
have to have a certain amount of energy

242
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:22,060
to even exist as a piece of light, a photon.

243
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,340
В.е. that is what stops this runaway into very short wavelengths.

244
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,860
В.е. he came to this postulate,

245
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,140
it's what allows the world to exist stably

246
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,660
and objects like the sun, so it's very, very fundamental.

247
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,620
В.е. here it is, the energy of a light wave

248
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,620
is given by a constant times its frequency,

249
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,780
and the frequency is related to the speed of light

250
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,660
and the wavelength in this way.

251
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,900
В.е. short wavelength photons have a lot of energy.

252
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,380
В.е. you sort of feel this,

253
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,140
when you listen to radio waves passing through you

254
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,980
and the room and everywhere, we don't feel a thing,

255
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
but if you stand in a bright sunlight,

256
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,140
obviously you're feeling that radiation.

257
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,940
В.е. the radiation comes in high energy packets,

258
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,420
and that's why x-rays or gamma rays are dangerous,

259
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,420
because each packet of energy can, you know,

260
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,140
do something destructive to the molecules in your cells.

261
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,780
В.е. here we are inside the bang,

262
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,340
and as we now look out in more detail

263
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,460
to this shell of radiation,

264
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,220
which is coming at us from the big bang,

265
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,060
you see this random pattern,

266
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,660
and this was first mapped initially by Kobe

267
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,820
at very low resolution, but then by this Planck satellite,

268
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,340
and so it looks like just a random pattern of waves.

269
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,140
В.е. somehow what came out of the big bang

270
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,940
was pretty much like this, just a random pattern of ripples.

271
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,300
The ripples, in this case, are the density of the universe.

272
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,580
It varies slightly from place to place,

273
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,220
and so does the temperature,

274
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,500
as we see this surface emitting radiation.

275
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,260
В.е. but it's anything but random,

276
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,380
because, so it is, and it isn't random.

277
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,900
В.е. it's random in the sense that the precise location of the waves is random,

278
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,700
but the spectrum of radiation of the waves,

279
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,180
just like with the Planck spectrum, is very, very precise.

280
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,500
В.е. so this power spectrum means,

281
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,460
if I look on a certain angular scale given by this formula,

282
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,700
then, as I vary the angular scale,

283
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,860
the strength of the waves varies according to this very precise curve.

284
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,380
В.е. these features on the curve are really nothing surprising.

285
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,500
They're just the sound waves in this hot plasma that came out of the big bang.

286
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,420
They have a characteristic scale,

287
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,300
just to do with the speed of sound in the plasma,

288
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,780
and that causes these peaks and troughs.

289
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:15,900
В.е. this curve was predicted long before the observations by Jim Peebles, among others.

290
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,660
Jim Peebles won the Nobel Prize for predicting this, among other things.

291
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,740
В.е. I was very fortunate to be the first to calculate this curve,

292
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,220
which is the curve of the power spectrum of polarization

293
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,180
of light coming from the big bang.

294
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,260
В.е. the experts in the field had published papers saying that this was zero,

295
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,700
but we realized that didn't make any sense.

296
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,500
В.е. me and my postdocs, and we calculated this.

297
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,740
В.е. amazingly, this curve is a prediction with no free parameters.

298
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,700
В.е. if you adjust the cosmology, cosmological parameters to fit this curve,

299
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,900
then this curve is absolutely predicted.

300
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,100
В.е. this was one of the first influences on me telling me something.

301
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,500
В.е. whatever is going on in the universe, it's really simple.

302
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,540
В.е. it's not arbitrary.

303
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,620
В.е. the laws, the universal Bayes are truly universal.

304
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,620
В.е. if we get them right,

305
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,820
в.е. the laws that go in here are Einstein's theory of gravity,

306
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,060
и в.е. the laws of plasma physics,

307
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,100
в.е. which were worked out in the 1920s, a long time ago.

308
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:36,220
В.е. here is our model of the universe called Lambda CDM.

309
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,780
В.е. it has just five fundamental parameters.

310
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,300
В.е. the matter and energy content of the universe are described by three numbers.

311
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,420
В.е. one is the cosmological constant.

312
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,460
В.е. it's a little bit of a surprise, but not too much,

313
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:57,580
В.е. this was the first type of energy Einstein envisaged to be relevant in the universe.

314
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,380
В.е. I'll explain that a little in a moment.

315
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,940
В.е. the dark matter,

316
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,340
в.е. I used to think it was extremely mysterious.

317
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,780
В.е. it's one of the big puzzles in cosmology.

318
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:16,380
В.е. recently I've come to believe that there is actually a highly economical explanation of the dark matter.

319
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,780
В.е. finally the ordinary atomic

320
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,340
В.е. nuclear matter, which we are made of,

321
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,660
В.е. and the abundance of that matter in the universe.

322
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,020
В.е. that's another parameter.

323
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,180
В.е. on top of that, there are two additional parameters.

324
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,420
В.е. one is the amplitude or strength of these density waves,

325
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,180
В.е. which came out of the Big Bang.

326
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,180
В.е. it's approximately one part and a hundred thousand.

327
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,740
В.е. the variation in the temperature from place to place,

328
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,460
В.е. coming out of the Big Bang.

329
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,140
В.е. the radiation we see is at three degrees Kelvin,

330
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,860
В.е. the fluctuations are about 30 microkelvin.

331
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,020
В.е. it's about one part and ten to minus five, just one number.

332
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,020
В.е. there's a slight red tilt,

333
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,540
В.е. telling you that fluctuations are ever so slightly stronger

334
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,060
В.е. on longer wavelengths,

335
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,180
В.е. as you look to longer wavelengths in the universe.

336
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,220
В.е. that's it.

337
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,060
В.е. that's it.

338
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,620
В.е. there is no other

339
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,660
В.е. conclusively measured parameter,

340
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,260
В.е. there's no evidence for anything beyond this.

341
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,940
В.е. there's no strong evidence.

342
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,860
В.е. there's slight anomalies here and there.

343
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,620
В.е. these may strengthen and become compelling,

344
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,500
В.е. but at the moment,

345
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,820
В.е. this may well be the full story.

346
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,620
В.е. in contrast, our theories

347
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,700
В.е. could not be more complicated.

348
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,500
В.е. people talk about a multiverse,

349
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,340
В.е. they talk about extra dimensions

350
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,780
В.е. and you know,

351
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,980
В.е. ten to the five hundred possible universes,

352
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,220
В.е. chaos on large scales,

353
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,940
В.е. that's not what we're seeing,

354
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,660
В.е. and so,

355
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,860
В.е. I've come to believe that what we need

356
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,540
В.е. is a truly minimal theory

357
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,620
В.е. that's highly economical

358
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,180
В.е. it should be judged on whether or not

359
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,740
В.е. it explains these numbers,

360
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,180
В.е. that's a tool order,

361
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,780
В.е. I'm going to tell you about a theory,

362
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,500
В.е. which at least explains the last two numbers

363
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,260
В.е. from first principles.

364
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,100
В.е. what is the red tilt?

365
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,020
В.е. I said it means the longer waves

366
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
В.е. are slightly stronger,

367
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,780
В.е. to make that a bit more precise,

368
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,580
В.е. it means that if you go to wavelengths

369
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,780
В.е. which are seven times longer,

370
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,180
В.е. you get 4% greater amplitude.

371
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,300
В.е. so not much.

372
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,740
В.е. В.е. because 7 is the square of E

373
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,020
В.е. and this tilt is 0.04.

374
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,700
В.е. this holds over a very wide range of scales

375
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,060
В.е. and one of my assumptions towards the end of the talk

376
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,860
В.е. that would hold over a truly vast range of scales

377
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,660
В.е. all the way from the plank length

378
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,700
В.е. up to the scales we observe

379
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,380
В.е. if so, this is an example of critical phenomena

380
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,140
В.е. critical phenomena are what happens

381
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,620
В.е. when systems go through a phase transition

382
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,620
В.е. an example is critical opalescence

383
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,540
В.е. you see this in very strongly heated water

384
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,060
В.е. at high pressure, if you heat water strongly enough

385
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
В.е. what happens is it turns into gas

386
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,340
В.е. the gas and water, that very hot water

387
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,100
В.е. the steam are indistinguishable

388
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,060
В.е. you go through this funny phase

389
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,260
В.е. which has very long range fluctuations

390
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,780
В.е. that's exactly what we see in the universe

391
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,060
В.е. it's very long range fluctuations

392
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,540
В.е. with a particular red tilt

393
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,860
В.е. this is a classic example, if true, of a critical phenomenon

394
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,100
В.е. here it is in the lab, you see this

395
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,820
В.е. this is a mixture of liquid and gas

396
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,740
В.е. at high pressure, you heat it up

397
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,380
В.е. this is the opalescence

398
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,100
В.е. has these long wavelength fluctuations

399
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,740
В.е. which make it slightly opaque to light

400
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,100
В.е. if you go further, it becomes a completely clear

401
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,140
В.е. superheated liquid

402
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,220
В.е. I've just one example

403
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,700
В.е. this is really everywhere

404
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,620
В.е. this type of phenomenon is really everywhere in physics

405
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,420
В.е. it may be that what we're seeing

406
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,860
В.е. is somehow critical behavior

407
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,500
В.е. at the Big Bang, which is pretty exciting, if true

408
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,660
В.е. this was a very expensive picture

409
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,780
В.е. made by the worlds

410
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,740
В.е. by the Dark Energy Telescope

411
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,060
В.е. there is actually a telescope

412
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,660
В.е. sorry, Dark Energy Survey

413
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,220
В.е. it's such a telescope, it costs millions of dollars

414
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,220
В.е. this is what it saw

415
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,980
В.е. that's the Dark Energy

416
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,020
В.е. Dark Energy is the simplest form of energy

417
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,420
В.е. it's absolutely uniform in space

418
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,620
В.е. and time, it's immutable, unchanging

419
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,020
В.е. it's a constant

420
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,260
В.е. that's why Einstein introduced it into his equation

421
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,180
В.е. as the very simplest type of matter

422
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,140
В.е. which might be relevant to cosmology

423
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,380
В.е. he was lucky, it turns out that most of the energy in the universe

424
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,860
В.е. seems to take this form

425
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,060
В.е. the strange thing about it is it's gravitationally repulsive

426
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,300
В.е. in contrast to ordinary matter

427
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,780
В.е. which attracts under gravity

428
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,620
В.е. this repels and causes the universe

429
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,340
В.е. to blow up

430
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,860
В.е. there's this rather beautiful cartoon

431
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,940
В.е. of Professor De Sitter

432
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,140
В.е. who solved Einstein's equations

433
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,460
В.е. with a cosmological constant

434
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,020
В.е. and lambda is a symbol

435
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,740
В.е. we use for the cosmological constant

436
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,580
В.е. he's in the shape of a lambda

437
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,460
В.е. the question it says

438
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,260
В.е. what makes the balloon blow up

439
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,380
В.е. that is done by the lambda

440
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,900
В.е. there can be no other answer

441
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,740
В.е. people knew about this in the 1920s

442
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,060
В.е. it's a very old idea

443
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,420
В.е. I've introduced some of the

444
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,740
В.е. some of the ingredients

445
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,220
В.е. dark matter is not

446
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,940
В.е. the cosmological constant

447
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
В.е. it's some kind of matter

448
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,620
В.е. which clumps gravitationally

449
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,100
В.е. people are often a bit suspicious

450
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,500
В.е. of that in cosmology

451
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,900
В.е. why do you introduce some weird form

452
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,660
В.е. of matter and then assumes

453
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
В.е. it clumps under gravity

454
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,300
В.е. and so on

455
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,260
В.е. they're right to be suspicious

456
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,420
В.е. but actually due to

457
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,060
В.е. the recent observational developments

458
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,380
В.е. we can now actually see

459
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
В.е. this dark matter

460
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,300
В.е. using gravitational lensing

461
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,500
В.е. as the light is emitted

462
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,260
В.е. from this surface

463
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,820
В.е. the hot surface to us

464
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,540
В.е. it travels through

465
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,300
В.е. this distribution of matter

466
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,140
В.е. on the way and that deflects

467
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,100
В.е. through lensing

468
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,820
В.е. literally by gravity

469
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,500
В.е. bending of light by gravity

470
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,420
В.е. you see this lensed pattern

471
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,060
В.е. is what we actually measure

472
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,940
В.е. through measuring that pattern

473
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
В.е. we can infer what the dark matter

474
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,540
В.е. was doing

475
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,740
В.е. this has recently been done

476
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,620
В.е. just this year

477
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,380
В.е. another telescope looking

478
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:15,860
В.е. at the

479
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,540
В.е. radiation from the Big Bang

480
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,380
В.е. inferring this

481
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,060
В.е. distribution of dark matter

482
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,780
В.е. here's the actual

483
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,260
В.е. projected density of dark matter

484
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,820
В.е. along the line of sight

485
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,660
В.е. all the way back

486
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,740
В.е. to the

487
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,460
В.е. the Big Bang

488
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,020
В.е. so now we can actually

489
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,260
В.е. literally see that

490
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,820
В.е. much as you see

491
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,260
В.е. a drop of water

492
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,140
В.е. on your fingertip

493
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,180
В.е. if you look at a light

494
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,820
В.е. behind it

495
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,020
В.е. you see it by the bending

496
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,140
В.е. the water is transparent

497
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,060
В.е. you see its effect

498
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,780
В.е. bending the light

499
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,580
В.е. this is the same

500
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,420
В.е. the same effect

501
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
В.е. gravity is doing the

502
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,620
В.е. the same effect

503
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,820
В.е. we can see this

504
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,340
В.е. dark matter

505
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,020
В.е. we still don't know

506
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,740
В.е. what it is

507
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,500
В.е. I'm going to tell

508
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,220
В.е. what it is

509
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,380
В.е. in a minute or two

510
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,060
В.е. of course there's a

511
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,380
В.е. a gigantic puzzle

512
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,220
В.е. the whole thing

513
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,340
В.е. the Big Bang

514
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,580
В.е. that we live inside

515
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,620
В.е. seems to have

516
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,660
В.е. originated

517
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
В.е. at a point

518
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,940
В.е. it seems that

519
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,220
В.е. everything we see

520
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,380
В.е. traces back

521
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,460
В.е. to a single point

522
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,860
В.е. 14 billion years ago

523
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,980
В.е. that's a massive

524
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,660
В.е. surprise

525
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,260
В.е. what I'm going to

526
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,660
В.е. I'm going to claim

527
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,140
В.е. that by dealing

528
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,140
В.е. with this strange

529
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,180
В.е. that by dealing with this strange

530
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:31,220
В.е. that by dealing with this strange

531
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,660
В.е. that by making

532
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,580
В.е. a very specific

533
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,260
В.е. hypothesis

534
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,780
В.е. about it

535
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,340
В.е. many of the puzzles

536
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,220
В.е. in cosmology

537
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
В.е. get resolved

538
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,260
В.е. before we do that

539
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,740
В.е. I want to tell

540
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,420
В.е. a little bit more

541
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,460
В.e. a little bit more

542
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,660
В.e. about microscopes

543
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,860
В.e. microscopes

544
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,060
В.e. how we see

545
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,620
В.e. the subatomic world

546
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,460
В.e. Large Hadron Collider

547
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,500
В.e. the greatest microscope

548
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,140
В.e. built

549
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,580
В.e. these cosmological

550
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,260
В.e. measurements

551
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,980
В.e. are even better

552
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,820
В.e. microscopes

553
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,860
В.e. potentially take

554
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,700
В.e. us all the way back

555
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,500
В.e. to the Big Bang

556
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,700
В.e. this special point

557
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,260
В.e. let's just

558
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,500
В.e. talk about microscopes

559
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,020
В.e. is a page

560
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,460
В.e. from Heisenberg's

561
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,420
В.e. book on quantum mechanics

562
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,060
В.e. I just want to give

563
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,460
В.e. an impression

564
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,540
В.e. of how he argued

565
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
В.e. for uncertainty

566
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,740
В.e. the uncertainty principle

567
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,780
В.e. followed from

568
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,140
В.e. Plank's observation

569
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,180
В.e. that light had to

570
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,100
В.e. be quantized

571
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,300
В.e. energy packets

572
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
В.e. so I'm trying to

573
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,100
В.e. I'm going to explain

574
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,580
В.e. actually Heisenberg's

575
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,180
В.e. explanation

576
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,900
В.e. attributes

577
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,580
В.e. to Bohr

578
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,060
В.e. down there

579
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,780
В.e. one thing about Heisenberg

580
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,700
В.e. these diagrams

581
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,660
В.e. really weren't very good

582
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,220
В.e. this isn't even horizontal

583
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,420
В.e. nor does it really tell

584
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,500
В.e. what that X means

585
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,340
В.e. anyway, it's an

586
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,300
В.e. amazing argument

587
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
В.e. the basic point

588
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,900
В.e. about the uncertainty principle

589
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,180
В.e. is that waves spread

590
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,940
В.e. you can convince yourself

591
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,020
В.e. of this just by taking

592
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,620
В.e. a stick

593
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,220
В.e. poking

594
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,380
В.e. the surface of a lake

595
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
В.e. like Silver Lake

596
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,220
В.e. outside here

597
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,540
В.e. when you poke

598
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,660
В.e. the surface of the water

599
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,580
В.e. you get waves which spread out

600
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,380
В.e. imagine you try

601
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,300
В.e. to emit a wave

602
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,540
В.e. going in one direction

603
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,700
В.e. that's impossible to do

604
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,980
В.e. with a stick

605
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,540
В.e. you just use the point

606
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,460
В.e. so you poke the point

607
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,860
В.e. all you'll get is

608
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,620
В.e. spreading wave

609
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,860
В.e. it won't go in a single

610
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,180
В.e. direction, it'll spread out

611
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,860
В.e. in all directions

612
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,060
В.e. the only way to get it

613
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,460
В.e. to go in one direction

614
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,660
В.e. is to use the stick sideways

615
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,460
В.e. so with a stick

616
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,100
В.e. extended like this

617
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,420
В.e. you poke it into the water

618
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,060
В.e. the wave will go forward

619
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,740
В.e. in that direction

620
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,820
В.e. but of course it'll spread out

621
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,340
В.e. at the ends

622
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,260
В.e. that's called diffraction

623
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,380
В.e. that was well known

624
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,940
В.e. as a wave phenomenon

625
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,660
В.e. I send a wave in

626
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,540
В.e. to see some object

627
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,940
В.e. this structure here

628
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,340
В.e. is supposed to be the microscope

629
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,100
В.e. I send a wave in

630
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,460
В.e. an object of size

631
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,660
В.e. delta x

632
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,100
В.e. what's going to happen

633
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,300
В.e. is the waves will spread

634
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,060
В.e. they spread by this amount

635
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,500
В.e. the angle of spreading

636
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,460
В.e. is just the wavelength

637
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,300
В.e. delta x

638
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,820
В.e. so intuitively

639
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,020
В.e. it's sort of obvious

640
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,140
В.e. you can't see

641
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,740
В.e. an object smaller

642
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,620
В.e. than the wavelength

643
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,020
В.e. of the light

644
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,860
В.e. what actually happens

645
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,980
В.e. the light comes in

646
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,580
В.e. it jiggles the object

647
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,500
В.e. the object then

648
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,860
В.e. re-emits or scatters

649
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,460
В.e. the light

650
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,180
В.e. it does so in this way

651
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,900
В.e. that spreads

652
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,580
В.e. this was all

653
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,620
В.e. very well understood

654
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,340
В.e. before

655
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,540
В.e. quantum mechanics

656
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,180
В.e. but I think it's a nice

657
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,220
В.e. physical illustration

658
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,580
В.e. the uncertainty principle

659
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,140
В.e. this is something

660
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,820
В.e. you cannot

661
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,420
В.e. possibly

662
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,740
В.e. violate

663
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,980
В.e. you cannot

664
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,900
В.e. possibly make

665
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,540
В.e. a plane

666
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,180
В.e. a wave

667
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,940
В.e. by sticking

668
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,820
В.e. a point

669
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,420
В.e. into

670
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,140
В.e. a pond

671
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,260
В.e. however

672
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,980
В.e. I just told you

673
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,580
В.e. that the light

674
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,660
В.e. actually is made out

675
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,020
В.e. out of

676
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,780
В.e. particles

677
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,620
В.e. it's made out

678
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,500
В.e. out of these quanta

679
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
В.e. photons

680
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,180
В.e. the problem is

681
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,100
В.e. that particles

682
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,780
В.e. kick

683
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,900
В.e. this light

684
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,060
В.e. is coming in

685
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,900
В.e. it's actually

686
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,340
В.e. a packet of energy

687
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,940
В.e. now you're telling

688
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,340
В.e. that that packet

689
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,140
В.e. is going to

690
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,740
В.e. spread

691
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,980
В.e. according to the wave

692
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,900
В.e. that the packet

693
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,780
В.e. could be

694
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,700
В.e. deflected

695
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,540
В.e. through this

696
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,380
В.e. angle

697
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,700
В.e. theta

698
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,580
В.e. when it's

699
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,420
В.e. deflected

700
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,980
В.e. that gives a kick

701
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,420
В.e. so the light

702
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,020
В.e. was actually

703
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,780
В.e. this particle

704
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,380
В.e. came in

705
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,500
В.e. hit the object

706
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,460
В.e. trying to see

707
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,740
В.e. and

708
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,380
В.e. got

709
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
В.e. spread out

710
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,100
В.e. don't know

711
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,980
В.e. where the particle

712
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,420
В.e. is

713
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,900
В.e. it could be

714
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,540
В.e. anywhere

715
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,460
В.e. that's spread

716
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,620
В.e. that's random

717
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,060
В.e. that's what

718
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,740
В.e. quantum mechanic

719
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,060
В.e. says

720
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,140
В.e. that the precise

721
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,500
В.e. angle

722
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,380
В.e goes is random

723
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,900
В.e. because it

724
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,220
В.e. can be

725
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,820
В.e deflected

726
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,620
В.e. any angle

727
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,140
В.e. kicks the particle

728
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,340
В.e. basically what

729
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:13,860
В.e. that means

730
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,540
В.e. you can go through

731
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,100
В.e. the algebra

732
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,700
В.e. means that

733
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,060
В.e. the uncertainty

734
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,860
В.e. in the position

735
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,620
В.e. of the particle

736
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,620
В.e. you're measuring

737
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,180
В.e. multiplied

738
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,700
В.e. the uncertainty

739
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,660
В.e. in its momentum

740
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,780
В.e. is equal to

741
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,260
В.e. planks

742
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,020
В.e. approximately

743
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,380
В.e. equal to

744
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,260
В.e. planks constant

745
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,100
В.e. so that's

746
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,700
В.e. Heisenberg's

747
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,180
В.e. uncertainty

748
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:30,660
В.e relation

749
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,380
В.e. it's a direct

750
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,300
В.e consequence

751
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,340
В.e fact that

752
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:33,380
В.e fact that

753
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:33,940
В.e light comes

754
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,740
В.e. in packets

755
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,740
В.e. and that

756
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,820
В.e. light is a wave

757
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,260
В.e. and spreads

758
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,300
В.e. this was

759
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,580
В.e. one of

760
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,300
В.e. a number of

761
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,460
В.e. thought experiments

762
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:42,820
В.e. which

763
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,340
В.e. Heisenberg

764
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,700
В.e. and others

765
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,220
В.e. went through

766
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,820
В.e. to convince

767
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,580
В.e. themselves

768
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,420
В.e. that

769
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,180
В.e. this uncertainty

770
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,700
В.e. principle

771
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,220
В.e. could never

772
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,180
В.e. violated

773
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,620
В.e. it's very

774
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,660
В.e. very drastic

775
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,580
В.e. leads to

776
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,660
В.e. all sorts

777
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,380
В.e. of changes

778
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:54,860
В.e. the laws

779
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,540
В.e. of physics

780
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,180
В.e. with respect

781
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,260
В.e. to classical physics

782
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,660
В.e. a slight extension

783
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,820
В.e. of this microscope

784
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,260
В.e. pictures

785
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,020
В.e. to ask yourself

786
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,100
В.e. what is the smallest

787
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,940
В.e. possible

788
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
В.e. object

789
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,420
В.e. I could ever

790
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,060
В.e. see

791
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,940
В.e. what's the smallest

792
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,900
В.e. possible

793
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,380
В.e. length

794
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:10,860
В.e. I could ever

795
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,780
В.e see

796
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,500
В.e. So let's send

797
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,140
В.e. a very

798
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,780
В.e. high energy

799
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,260
В.e. short

800
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,460
В.e. wavelength

801
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:16,820
В.e. packet

802
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,260
В.e. of light

803
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,020
В.e. what happens

804
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,900
В.e. it's

805
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,860
В.e. it comes in

806
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,020
В.e. it's going to

807
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,780
В.e. collide

808
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,420
В.e. with the

809
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:25,820
В.e. object

810
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,100
В.e. measuring

811
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,980
В.e. the problem is

812
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,740
В.e. you've packed

813
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,460
В.e. a vast amount of energy

814
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,380
В.e. into a short

815
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,420
В.e. a tiny

816
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,100
В.e. region of space

817
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,660
В.e. when that happens

818
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,900
В.e. you get a black hole

819
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,780
В.e. because it

820
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,460
В.e. self-gravitates

821
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,420
В.e. spacetime

822
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,860
В.e. literally

823
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,380
В.e falls inwards

824
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,780
В.e. you get a black hole

825
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,500
В.e. unfortunately

826
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,140
В.e. microscope

827
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,580
В.e doesn't work

828
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,460
В.e. you can't see

829
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,340
В.e. any length

830
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,900
В.e. smaller

831
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,020
В.e. than this length

832
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,460
В.e. because

833
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,300
В.e. the light simply

834
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,700
В.e. wouldn't escape

835
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,900
В.e. to be seen

836
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,500
В.e. so this is

837
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,660
В.e. the plank length

838
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,660
В.e. that

839
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,300
В.e. believe

840
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,100
В.e. Einstein's theory

841
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,900
В.e. of gravity

842
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,300
В.e. believe quantum mechanics

843
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,500
В.e. this is unavoidable

844
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,180
В.e. largest

845
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,860
В.e. visible length

846
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,420
В.e. there's also

847
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:11,860
В.e. largest

848
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,620
В.e. visible length

849
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,220
В.e. I've told you

850
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,460
В.e. about lambda

851
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,220
В.e. how lambda

852
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,100
В.e. has repulsive

853
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,460
В.e. gravity

854
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,180
В.e. just

855
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,100
В.e. it's just the opposite

856
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,380
В.e. it's just like

857
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:20,980
В.e. in this case

858
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,820
В.e. we're

859
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,300
В.e. lambda causes

860
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,620
В.e. the universe to expand

861
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,820
В.e. in an

862
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,700
В.e. accelerating

863
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,820
В.e. fashion

864
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,980
В.e. that creates

865
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,460
В.e. what we call

866
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,940
В.e. the lambda horizon

867
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,060
В.e. anything further

868
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,660
В.e. than a certain

869
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,220
В.e. distance

870
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,980
В.e. we will never

871
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,500
В.e. will never see

872
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,100
В.e. it may emit

873
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,500
В.e. light

874
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
В.e. it's been

875
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,380
В.e. that

876
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:41,820
В.e. region

877
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,460
В.e. is being

878
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,100
В.e. accelerated

879
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,700
В.e. away from us

880
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,780
В.e. so fast

881
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,260
В.e. any

882
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,660
В.e. lighted

883
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,060
В.e. admits

884
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,740
В.e. will never

885
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,420
В.e. ever

886
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,980
В.e. reach us

887
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,820
В.e. so this

888
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,580
В.e. is the largest

889
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,140
В.e. visible length

890
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,900
В.e. actually that's

891
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,620
В.e. not

892
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,460
В.e. so different

893
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:54,740
В.e. than the

894
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,180
В.e. size

895
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,780
В.e. of the region

896
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,180
В.e. now

897
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,660
В.e. see

898
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:56,900
В.e. in the

899
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,860
В.e. universe

900
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,700
В.e. so gravity

901
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,580
В.e. in both cases

902
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,100
В.e. fixes

903
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,820
В.e. the smallest

904
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,260
В.e. possible

905
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,140
В.e. visible length

906
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,060
В.e. the largest

907
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,300
В.e. largest one

908
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,060
В.e. so coming

909
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
В.e. back to

910
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,540
В.e. microscopes

911
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:12,860
В.e. here's

912
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,180
В.e. the large

913
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,980
В.e. Hadron Collider

914
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,460
В.e. this was

915
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,260
В.e. its big discovery

916
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,380
В.e. Higgs Boson

917
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,020
В.e. which

918
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,020
В.e. I'll show you

919
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,500
В.e. more about

920
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,740
В.e. in a moment

921
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,540
В.e. and my

922
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,620
В.e. colleague in Edinburgh

923
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,540
В.e. is Peter Higgs

924
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,180
В.e. is the person

925
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,620
В.e. who postulated

926
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,900
В.e. Higgs Boson

927
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,860
В.e. standing there

928
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,620
В.e. like he

929
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,260
В.e understands

930
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,500
В.e. understands what's

931
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,180
В.e. going on

932
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,300
В.e. I guarantee

933
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,820
В.e does not

934
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,700
В.e. like me

935
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,460
В.e. is a theorist

936
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,780
В.e. spend our times

937
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,500
В.e. worrying about

938
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,260
В.e. concepts

939
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,740
В.e. issues of principle

940
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,180
В.e. it takes

941
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,380
В.e. real people

942
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,220
В.e. to build

943
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,380
В.e. vast

944
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,180
В.e. experiment

945
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,740
В.e. practical

946
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,500
В.e. people

947
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,580
В.e. to build experiments

948
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,140
В.e. to test

949
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,860
В.e. these ideas

950
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
В.e. amazingly

951
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,340
В.e. that is

952
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,060
В.e. what they did

953
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,420
В.e. took

954
00:36:59,420 --> 00:36:59,780
В.e. took about

955
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,660
В.e. 50 years

956
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,500
В.e. of continuous

957
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,340
В.e. development

958
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,740
В.e. to build

959
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,100
В.e. the Large

960
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,180
В.e. Hadron Collider

961
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
В.e. when it was built

962
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,980
В.e. Higgs Boson

963
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
В.e. was there

964
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,620
В.e. exactly

965
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,380
В.e. where it was

966
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,420
В.e. predicted to be

967
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,660
В.e. So

968
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,540
В.e. this now is

969
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,140
В.e. all known physics

970
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,780
В.e. summarized

971
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,620
В.e. in a single

972
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,380
В.e. equation

973
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,780
В.e. have gravity

974
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,620
В.e. Einstein's theory

975
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,700
В.e. of gravity

976
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,660
В.e. all the forces

977
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,020
В.e. like electromagnetism

978
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,580
В.e. nuclear forces

979
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,700
В.e. all the particles

980
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,060
В.e. described by

981
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,020
В.e. Dirac

982
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,380
В.e. Higgs is very lucky

983
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,420
В.e. gets three

984
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,860
В.e. three terms

985
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,940
В.e. this equation

986
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,060
В.e. The last one includes

987
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,180
В.e. the lambda

988
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,060
В.e. want to point out

989
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,780
В.e. some things

990
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,620
В.e. you'll have noticed

991
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,340
В.e. that Planck's law

992
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,620
В.e. following Boltzmann

993
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,340
В.e. included an exponential

994
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,540
В.e. to the minus

995
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,940
В.e. laws of quantum mechanics

996
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,580
В.e. are the same

997
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,260
В.e. except now

998
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,620
В.e. there's an imaginary number

999
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,180
В.e. i squared

1000
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,620
В.e. is minus one

1001
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,380
В.e. again we get

1002
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,980
В.e. get this exponential

1003
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,300
В.e. with an imaginary number

1004
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,700
В.e. here's Planck's

1005
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,820
В.e. constant H

1006
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,420
В.e. it's H over two pi

1007
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,940
В.e. H bar

1008
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,620
В.e. these are all

1009
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,780
В.e. the laws we know

1010
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,860
В.e. my current point

1011
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,980
В.e. is maybe that's all

1012
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
В.e. there is

1013
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,260
В.e. there is no evidence

1014
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,140
В.e. for anything

1015
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,340
В.e. beyond this

1016
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,940
В.e. the real challenge

1017
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,340
В.e. physics now

1018
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,300
В.e. is to

1019
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,580
В.e. calculate

1020
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,780
В.e. all natural processes

1021
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,580
В.e. using these laws

1022
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,460
В.e. it's changed

1023
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,020
В.e. there are no new particles

1024
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,460
В.e. I'll justify that

1025
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,100
В.e. in a moment

1026
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,980
В.e. key points to remember

1027
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,460
В.e. there's an i in here

1028
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,860
В.e. a strange imaginary number

1029
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,820
В.e. there are these particles

1030
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,060
В.e. like the electron

1031
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,180
В.e. and the quarks

1032
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,420
В.e. atomic nuclear

1033
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,780
В.e. are made of

1034
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,740
В.e. the rest of it

1035
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,860
В.e. are all in a sense

1036
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,780
В.e. connections

1037
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,060
В.e. this is

1038
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,060
В.e. this is a precise

1039
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,220
В.e. mathematical term

1040
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,540
В.e. a connection

1041
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,780
В.e. a connection tells you

1042
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,620
В.e. how things travel

1043
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,460
В.e. how they affect each other

1044
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,660
В.e. that seems to be

1045
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,580
В.e. that everything else

1046
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,660
В.e. is a connection

1047
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,580
В.e. you have particles

1048
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,700
В.e. then you have gravity

1049
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,500
В.e. which connects them

1050
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,380
В.e. you have electromagnetism

1051
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,500
В.e. which connects them

1052
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,020
В.e. that seems to be

1053
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,340
В.e. the underlying logic

1054
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,380
В.e. the laws of physics

1055
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,140
В.e. here it is in more detail

1056
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,580
В.e. we have quarks

1057
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,660
В.e. atomic nuclear

1058
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
В.e. are made of

1059
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,580
В.e. we have leptons

1060
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,500
В.e. like the electron

1061
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,660
В.e. like neutrinos

1062
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,620
В.e. the Higgs boson

1063
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,380
В.e. which couples to

1064
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
В.e. everybody

1065
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,300
В.e. as does gravity

1066
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,100
В.e. then we have

1067
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,980
В.e. these forces

1068
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,220
В.e. the strong weak

1069
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,100
В.e. electromagnetic forces

1070
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,740
В.e. that seems to be

1071
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,940
В.e. all there is

1072
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,180
В.e. now so these are

1073
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,980
В.e. all the particles

1074
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,780
В.e. that we've discovered

1075
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,340
В.e. in accelerator laboratories

1076
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,500
В.e. as I mentioned CERN

1077
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,220
В.e. has not discovered

1078
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,260
В.e. anything beyond

1079
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,100
В.e. these yet

1080
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,500
В.e. there is one

1081
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,180
В.e. these are the

1082
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,300
В.e. left-handed neutrinos

1083
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,340
В.e. you'll notice the

1084
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,300
В.e. L here

1085
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,060
В.e. we've only ever

1086
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,580
В.e. observed

1087
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,020
В.e. left-handed neutrinos

1088
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,340
В.e. left-handed means

1089
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,220
В.e. it's traveling

1090
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,420
В.e. along my thumb

1091
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,340
В.e. it's spinning

1092
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,220
В.e. this way

1093
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,860
В.e. that's the only

1094
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,020
В.e. ones we've seen

1095
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,020
В.e. however

1096
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,860
В.e. we want to solve

1097
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,340
В.e. the problem of

1098
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,540
В.e. the dark matter

1099
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,660
В.e. to start off with

1100
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,100
В.e. what is the

1101
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,140
В.e. dark matter

1102
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,860
В.e. oh I should

1103
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,660
В.e. mention one

1104
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,180
В.e. another thing

1105
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,420
В.e. there's a

1106
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,300
В.e. puzzle

1107
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:34,500
В.e. there are

1108
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,820
В.e. three generations

1109
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,140
В.e. right

1110
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,420
В.e. this pattern

1111
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,500
В.e. up down

1112
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,260
В.e. electron

1113
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,940
В.e. neutrino

1114
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,180
В.e. electron neutrino

1115
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,820
В.e. is copied

1116
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
В.e. three times

1117
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,460
В.e. it's quite

1118
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,820
В.e. strange

1119
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,540
В.e. why is that?

1120
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,700
В.e. don't know

1121
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,380
В.e. I'm going to tell

1122
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:49,900
В.e. that there

1123
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
В.e. is an explanation

1124
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,220
В.e. now

1125
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,620
В.e. it's part

1126
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,140
В.e. of this new

1127
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,620
В.e. theory

1128
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,900
В.e. that we think

1129
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,420
В.e. this was

1130
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:55,900
В.e. forced

1131
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,620
В.e. the left-handed

1132
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,100
В.e. neutrinos

1133
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,660
В.e. are not going to

1134
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,180
В.e. explain the

1135
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,220
В.e. dark matter

1136
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:07,660
В.e. we've

1137
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,140
В.e. observed

1138
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,620
В.e. all of them

1139
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,020
В.e. they have

1140
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,100
В.e. have tiny

1141
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,180
В.e. masses

1142
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,300
В.e. turns

1143
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,500
В.e. turns out

1144
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,820
В.e. there's a

1145
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,380
В.e. simple

1146
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,700
В.e. fix

1147
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:14,980
В.e. just

1148
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,380
В.e. delete

1149
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,540
В.e. delete the

1150
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,180
В.e. l

1151
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,740
В.e. l

В.e. l

1153
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,460
В.e. l

1154
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:18,900
В.e. all right

1155
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,500
В.e. imagine

1156
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,460
В.e. electrons

1157
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:20,940
В.e. like

1158
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,300
В.e. other

1159
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,180
В.e. particles

1160
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,540
В.e. come in

1161
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:22,940
В.e. left

1162
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
В.e. right-handed

1163
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,740
В.e. versions

1164
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:26,740
В.e. imagine

1165
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:26,940
В.e. imagine that

1166
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,300
В.e. you've

1167
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,660
В.e. just got

1168
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,180
В.e. to add

1169
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,020
В.e. right-handed

1170
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,460
В.e partners

1171
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:29,780
В.e. to the

1172
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,300
В.e left-handed

1173
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,180
В.e neutrinos

1174
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,420
В.e. that's

1175
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,300
В.e. very modest

1176
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,340
В.e. modus

1177
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,940
В.e. change

1178
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,620
В.e. standard

1179
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,380
В.e. model

1180
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,020
В.e. model

1181
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,460
В.e. it's

1182
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:36,980
В.e. suggested

1183
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,020
В.e. by symmetry

1184
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,100
В.e. because

1185
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,820
В.e. now everybody

1186
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,180
В.e. has a

1187
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,180
А это правильный партнер.

1188
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,180
Так что это наиболее известная экстенция.

1189
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Это стандартный модель, который был предложен в 1970-х годах.

1190
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,180
И это наверное вероятно.

1191
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,180
Почему вероятно?

1192
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,180
Потому что, если эти правильные нутриношки

1193
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,180
были вероятно, то мы бы не увидели их в экспериментах.

1194
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Но они объяснили, почему нутриношки, которые мы видим,

1195
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
имеют небольшую массу.

1196
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Они не массового масса.

1197
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,180
И это значит, что нутриношки могут путешествовать

1198
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,180
вместе с нутриношками

1199
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,180
и transmute в нутриношку.

1200
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
Это очень тяжелое.

1201
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,180
И это вызывает много энергии.

1202
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Так что вы не можете перестануть нутриношку.

1203
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
Это вероятно нутриношка.

1204
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,180
Вы оцениваете в это,

1205
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,180
для очень небольшого момента времени,

1206
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,180
в принципе, в инверции массы.

1207
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,180
И потом вы должны оценивать в нутриношку.

1208
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
После этого,

1209
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,180
и в то, что вы и мы видим,

1210
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,180
это ст assumed.

1211
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,180
И на cảע 2013 года,

1212
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,180
illafer と latest ...

1213
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
feit of malls

1214
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,180
там, и есть они choices.

1215
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,180
И как It's hard ever,

1216
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,180
searching for a mechanism

1217
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,180
for открытуб recipe

1218
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,180
?

1219
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,180
What,

1220
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,180
But,

1221
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,180
hey,

1222
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,180
sir,,

1223
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,180
это просто Perfect Dark Matter Кандидат,

1224
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,180
потому что они не стремятся

1225
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
к светлому или другому вооружению,

1226
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,180
что мы знаем о том.

1227
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
Они только стремятся

1228
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
к гравитой и к этой хиггой.

1229
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,180
Так что эти правильные андонитрии

1230
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,180
могут быть Dark Matter.

1231
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,180
И мы нашли, что мы могли объяснить,

1232
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,180
так что теперь это начинается

1233
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,180
получать космологическое.

1234
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,180
Примечательно, как вы объяснили

1235
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
их абонент в мире?

1236
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,180
Как вы объяснили это?

1237
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,180
Мы нашли объяснение о их абонентах.

1238
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,180
Если мы assumим, что

1239
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,180
универсия была invariанная

1240
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,180
под другую симметрию,

1241
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,180
которая называется CPT.

1242
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,180
CPT — это самая основная симметрия,

1243
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,180
известная в физике.

1244
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,180
Она говорит, если я беру

1245
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,180
систему, и для каждого партика

1246
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,180
я расположу это с антипартикой.

1247
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,180
И я вверховываю

1248
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,180
и вернусь в то время,

1249
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,180
что должно быть симметрия

1250
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,180
для системы.

1251
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,180
Но это будет

1252
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,180
действовать в идентичной манере.

1253
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,180
Итак, есть

1254
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,180
CPT-симметрия.

1255
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,180
Симметрия

1256
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,180
является, что универсия

1257
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,180
рассчитывает эту симметрию.

1258
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,180
Это симметрия фундаментной лошади.

1259
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,180
Универсия

1260
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,180
мог бы и рассчитать или вернуть.

1261
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,180
Что если бы это рассчитать?

1262
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,180
Если бы это рассчитать,

1263
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,180
то для нашей материи

1264
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,180
универсий, мы получили более материи

1265
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,180
универсией.

1266
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,180
Есть быть партнер,

1267
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,180
который имеет более антиматер.

1268
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,180
Матер.

1269
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,180
Время будет в opposite

1270
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,180
направлении для партнера.

1271
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,180
Но

1272
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
то же самое,

1273
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,180
что в размере

1274
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,180
универсией, когда это

1275
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,180
рассчитает до 0 на БигБанге,

1276
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,180
это так линиально

1277
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,180
в времени.

1278
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,180
И если это рассчитать линиально,

1279
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,180
то можно просто рассчитать.

1280
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,180
Это называется аналитическая

1281
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,180
континуация.

1282
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,180
Это универсия.

1283
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,180
И, в принципе, можно продолжить

1284
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,180
в правой стороны

1285
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,180
универсией,

1286
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,180
в левом стороне,

1287
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,180
через БигБангс-сингюнарию.

1288
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,180
Так, это возможность.

1289
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,180
Если вы делаете это,

1290
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,180
в том числе, вы предыдущите

1291
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,180
объемы

1292
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,180
для материи.

1293
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,180
О, я бы сказал,

1294
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,180
вы видите,

1295
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
это как метод

1296
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,180
из образа.

1297
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,180
В физике, если у вас есть

1298
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,180
линия,

1299
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,180
и вы хотите absolвировать

1300
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,180
эффекты для материи

1301
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,180
в присутствии материи,

1302
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,180
то есть два ways

1303
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,180
для этого.

1304
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,180
То есть,

1305
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,180
вы фигураете,

1306
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
как много линия

1307
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,180
выживаете в линии,

1308
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,180
и это сбавляет

1309
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
от материи,

1310
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,180
в том числе,

1311
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,180
по предыдущей

1312
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,180
структуре,

1313
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,180
и потом вернется.

1314
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,180
Или вы делаете что-то simpler,

1315
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,180
то есть, вы делаете

1316
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,180
карбонный копий

1317
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,180
для себя,

1318
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,180
и если вы правой стороны,

1319
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,180
вы делаете левом стороне,

1320
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,180
на другом стороне

1321
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,180
материи,

1322
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,180
вы выживаете материю,

1323
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,180
и вы просто собираете линию

1324
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,180
от одного копия

1325
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,180
к другому.

1326
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,180
Это то, что это делается.

1327
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,180
Так, это просто

1328
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,180
метод работы

1329
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,180
к космологии,

1330
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,180
в том числе,

1331
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,180
чтобы импозировать

1332
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
структур,

1333
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,180
который обращается к CPT.

1334
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,180
Так, нет реалити

1335
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,180
к предыдущей структуре,

1336
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
это просто

1337
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,180
комфортная математическая

1338
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,180
структура.

1339
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,180
Так, в этом виде,

1340
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,180
большая структурка

1341
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,180
была мэра,

1342
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,180
специальная структурка,

1343
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,180
но она довольно уникальная.

1344
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,180
Это такая мэра,

1345
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,180
которая реликус think

1346
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,180
similarities

1347
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,180
explain

1348
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,180
All right and you,

1349
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,180
but you know,

1350
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,180
turnout in this picture you can

1351
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,180
calculate how many are produced.

1352
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,180
They produced this

1353
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,180
Hawking radiation

1354
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,180
from the big bang itself.

1355
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,180
And we can predict exactly

1356
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,180
what their abundance is.

1357
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,180
There's one adjustable parameter,

1358
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,180
which is their mass.

1359
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,180
If it happens to be this big,

1360
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,180
which is much bigger

1361
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,180
than the mass of a proton,

1362
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,180
they account for the dark matter.

1363
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,180
And this is the simplest

1364
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,820
И это просто-современная объяснение.

1365
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,200
Это не значит, что это вероятно, потому что я нужна

1366
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,900
для того, чтобы сделать предыдущие и проверить это.

1367
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,660
Благословенно, есть предыдущие.

1368
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,860
Если один из этих правительных нутрино,

1369
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,740
и есть три, как и остальные,

1370
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,540
если один из них стабиль,

1371
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,780
это означает, что лучший нутрино именно массовый.

1372
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,100
И вы можете видеть это с этой картой,

1373
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,580
потому что если правительный нутрино стабиль,

1374
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,060
то значит, вы должны выключить эту вероятно.

1375
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,180
Возможно, это будет декей в левом и хигом.

1376
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,340
Так что мы выключаем это,

1377
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,820
но если мы выключаем эту вероятно,

1378
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,980
мы также выключаем это, это то же вероятно.

1379
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,180
Так что этот левом нутрино не может быть с правительным.

1380
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,300
Так что этот нутрино массовый.

1381
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,260
И так вот это предыдущение.

1382
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,020
И, невозможно, это теперь тестово.

1383
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,980
То, что массовые нутрино,

1384
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,700
они теперь приобретены,

1385
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,660
через их влияние на стабиль.

1386
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,020
И так, лучшие галактические сервисы сейчас,

1387
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,660
один, который называется «Нуклад», это саталлайт.

1388
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,100
Европейская агентская саталлита.

1389
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,900
И большая сервисная сервиса «Спейс-Тайм» в Чилле.

1390
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,180
Эти сервисы сейчас приобретены на стабиль,

1391
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,060
и галактические сервисы.

1392
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,260
Они должны быть able to test this hypothesis.

1393
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,540
Так что мы увидим, что это и правда,

1394
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,740
если это и правда, то это массово.

1395
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,500
Тогда это становится легко,

1396
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
что это первая конвинция теории «Нуклад».

1397
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,900
В моем случае.

1398
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,460
Ок, так что я вернулся к этому.

1399
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,340
«Галактическая сервиса» – это галактическая сервиса,

1400
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,820
она была специальна стабильной стабильной агентской сервисы.

1401
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,100
«Галактическая сервиса» выключена линиально.

1402
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,980
Это было предназначено от Роджа Пенроу,

1403
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,260
который был предназначен в 1970-х годах.

1404
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,460
Пенроу изменили hypothesis,

1405
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,060
что initial singularity,

1406
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,140
это вещь, где все «спейс»

1407
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,700
приводят к «поинт»,

1408
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,740
это «конформал».

1409
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:03,060
Конформал означает, что «лайк» не видит.

1410
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,540
Лайк вверх – вы видите, что они вверх вверх.

1411
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,660
Они все, в принципе,

1412
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,620
копия именно так же.

1413
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,700
Лайк вверх не знает о том, что вверх вверх.

1414
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,460
Эквасть, которая подходит,

1415
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,140
она вверх вверх вверх.

1416
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,820
Лайк вверх «конформал».

1417
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,060
Пенроу изменили hypothesis,

1418
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,300
что «бигбанг» был «конформал».

1419
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,340
Если все вверх вверх behaved как «лайк»

1420
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,620
в «бигбанг»,

1421
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,500
то ничего не будет осознанным.

1422
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,060
Ничего вверх вверх вверх вверх.

1423
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,340
Не будет осознанным, что есть вверх.

1424
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,700
Потому что они не обожают, что вверх вверх вверх вверх.

1425
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,140
«конформал» так же.

1426
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,460
Если я беру квадрат,

1427
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,260
и пытаюсь высказывать это в круг,

1428
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,380
пытаюсь высказывать,

1429
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,820
в кругу вверх вверх,

1430
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,780
я могу это сделать в таком виде,

1431
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,140
как я обожаю англины.

1432
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,540
Это называется «конформал» маппинг.

1433
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,940
Если вы посмотрите, вы увидите,

1434
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,140
что англины на все эти вверх вверх

1435
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,900
oin Driving.

1436
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,980

1447
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,900
Индивидуальный человек.

1448
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,900
И здесь есть еще один из его красивых фотографий.

1449
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,900
Пенроз упоминал, что difficulty

1450
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:04,900
в объяснении, почему универсия так простая на больших scales.

1451
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,900
Как я уже говорил, в каждом направлении, мы смотрим в универсию,

1452
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,900
универсия практически одинаковая.

1453
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,900
Она просто варьет из этих рандомных вейвов,

1454
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,900
в которых амплитут есть только 10-5.

1455
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,900
Это, в основном, очень универсия, очень асоторопия,

1456
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,900
очень...

1457
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,900
Это очень-очень специальная геометрия.

1458
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Это не варь и конвелута.

1459
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,900
Итак, здесь универсия, который делает универсию

1460
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,900
и выбирает эту очень специальную геометрию,

1461
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,900
в которой мы видим, для универсия.

1462
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,900
И он объясняет, что это пузл.

1463
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,900
Итак, что я сейчас говорю,

1464
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,900
я думаю, что у нас есть soluция для этого пузла.

1465
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,900
Мы знаем, почему универсия так простая и простая.

1466
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,900
И причина это...

1467
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,900
Я имею в виду, что это оборудование идеи

1468
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,900
Стивен Хоркин и других.

1469
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,900
Но причина это, в основном,

1470
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,900
так же, как причина, что газа в этом доме

1471
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,900
является геометрией и асоторопией.

1472
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,900
Почему аэрмоликулы так смутно выживаются?

1473
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,900
И это хорошая вещь, потому что, если они все

1474
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,900
выживали в сторону, мы не могли бы оборудоваться.

1475
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,900
Они не делают это.

1476
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,900
И почему не?

1477
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,900
Просто рандомность.

1478
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,900
Это просто, что есть много более

1479
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,900
возможностей для моликулы,

1480
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,900
чтобы они смутно выживались,

1481
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,900
чем для них, чтобы они все были в одну сторону.

1482
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,900
И это энтропия.

1483
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,900
Максимальная энтропия

1484
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,900
объясняет хомогенеи

1485
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
аэрмоликулы.

1486
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,900
Это термодинамика.

1487
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,900
Вы не нуждите механизма.

1488
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,900
Это просто, что происходит,

1489
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
в большинстве времени.

1490
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,900
Так что, я буду показать,

1491
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,900
что у нас есть объяснение

1492
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
для геометрии геометрии,

1493
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,900
которая имеет такие характеристики.

1494
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,900
Термодинамика не требует механизма.

1495
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,900
Это, в основном,

1496
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,900
идеи бhaulкиноUC,

1497

1499
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,900
И Black holes

they can have a mass and that's it.

1510

Блэк-холлс – hundreds of solar masses in size.

1511
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:36,920
So, actually much more than that, millions of solar masses.

1512
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,920
A black hole has a temperature, which called a Hawking temperature.

1513
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,920
And so this was a huge surprise that black holes are slightly hot.

1514
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,920
It's a very tiny temperature, but they're slightly hot.

1515
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,920
More importantly, they have an entropy.

1516
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,920
Рафлеспеки нынешний говорит, что вы могли бы сделать это блэк-холлс.

1517
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Энтрибрэк-холлс – proportional to the area of the surface of the black hole.

1518
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,920
Here is Stephen Hawking at Perimeter.

1519
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,920
The Stephen Hawking Center was under construction.

1520
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,920
He visited a number of times.

1521
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,920
He was treated exceptionally well in the bistro, I must say, which he enjoyed.

1522
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,920
And was absolutely inspiring to have visit.

1523
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,920
Here he is with somebody else you may recognize,

1524
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,920
who the founder of Perimeter Institute, Mike Lazaridis,

1525
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,920
and we're out on Lake Huron during one of Stephen's visits.

1526
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,920
They both look very cool.

1527
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,920
So Hawking used a very profound mathematical trick,

1528
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,920
which I mentioned this I, this imaginary number,

1529
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,920
that distinguished the Boltzmann type,

1530
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,920
the thermodynamic arguments from the quantum arguments,

1531
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,920
and Hawking used that trick to relate the two.

1532
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,920
And the way he related them is by making time,

1533
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,920
by calculating in imaginary time.

1534
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,920
It sounds very speculative, but it's not.

1535
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,920
It's a very precise technique.

1536
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,920
He used imaginary time to calculate the Hawking temperature

1537
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,920
and gravitational entropy of a black hole.

1538
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,920
Now, essentially what he did is he took the spacetime of a black hole,

1539
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,920
which is a function of, which has a certain description

1540
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,920
in terms of real time and real space.

1541
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,920
And he said, what if time goes imaginary?

1542
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,920
It turns out, when time goes imaginary,

1543
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,920
the black hole is actually periodic in imaginary time.

1544
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,920
It repeats itself in imaginary time.

1545
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,920
And that's the signal of a temperature.

1546
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,920
If you have a system, which is periodic in imaginary time,

1547
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,920
the period actually defines a temperature,

1548
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,920
and that's at least one way to calculate the Hawking temperature.

1549
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,920
And the entropy calculated similarly.

1550
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,920
So recently we were able to do the same for cosmology.

1551
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,920
Calculate the Hawking temperature and the entropy for cosmology.

1552
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,920
I'll show you a simple example first,

1553
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
and then I'll show you the general case.

1554
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,920
So this was done by Hawking and collaborators.

1555
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,920
A cosmos with only lambda.

1556
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,920
This, in fact, was Einstein's first model of cosmology.

1557
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,920
Let's only have lambda and gravity.

1558
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,920
Well, it's repulsive, and so the universe,

1559
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,920
if it's a big circle in this case,

1560
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,920
I'm only plotting one dimension of space,

1561
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,920
so it's a circle, it shrinks and re-expands

1562
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,920
because of the repulsion.

1563
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,920
Okay, that's called De Sitter spacetime.

1564
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,920
And when you make time imaginary,

1565
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,920
the spacetime, time goes up,

1566
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,920
the time now becomes periodic.

1567
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,920
And so this is what Hawking called a gravitational instanton.

1568
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,920
It's the imaginary time version of De Sitter spacetime.

1569
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,920
It has a temperature,

1570
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,920
which is just the length of a great circle on that sphere,

1571
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,920
and it has an entropy, which you can calculate.

1572
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,920
So recently we were able to solve Einstein's equations

1573
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,920
for general cosmology with radiation,

1574
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,920
matter, curved spatially and lambda analytically,

1575
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,920
and we discovered it looks somewhat like this.

1576
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,920
It's not a sphere anymore, it's distorted.

1577
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:46,920
And so here's the imaginary time cosmos,

1578
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,920
from which you can calculate the entropy,

1579
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,920
and the real time cosmos you can think of,

1580
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,920
sort of sprouting out of the imaginary one.

1581
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,920
Why this is interesting,

1582
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,920
because it turns out that this gravitational entropy,

1583
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,920
if it is an entropy,

1584
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,920
just like the entropy of gas in a room,

1585
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,920
it tells you which cosmologies are more likely.

1586
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,920
And the ones which are most likely, according to this formula,

1587
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,920
are spatially flat, just like we see,

1588
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,920
homogeneous isotropic and isotropic.

1589
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,920
And secondly, this calculation also favors

1590
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,920
that the cosmological constant is small and positive,

1591
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,920
which is just as we see.

1592
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
So this is still very new,

1593
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,920
we're arguing lots of other experts what this means,

1594
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,920
but in my view, this is a thermodynamic explanation

1595
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,920
for the large-scale geometry of the universe,

1596
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,920
so we don't need smoothing or flattening mechanisms,

1597
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,920
some of you may have heard of inflation,

1598
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,920
which is a postulated period of very rapid expansion,

1599
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,920
just after the Big Bang Singularity,

1600
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,920
we don't seem to need that.

1601
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,920
Now, our telescopes are also microscopes,

1602
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,920
and as we look out in space,

1603
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,920
we are looking back in time.

1604
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,920
The universe is shrinking,

1605
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,920
that's what this picture shows,

1606
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,920
so currently the radius is 20 gigaparsecs, let's say,

1607
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,920
we shrink that region back to the Big Bang,

1608
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,920
it's about 10 microns,

1609
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,920
and then if I take that same region

1610
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,920
and follow it forward into somebody's eye,

1611
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,920
that's what we see.

1612
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,920
So this is the largest visible region of the universe,

1613
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,920
the one in green.

1614
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,920
Of course, as we're looking backward in time,

1615
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,920
the universe is smaller,

1616
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,920
what that means is that a structure that was only a plank length,

1617
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,920
or a wave that was only a plank length across,

1618
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,920
at the plank time, the smallest conceivable length,

1619
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,920
right now would be about a millimeter across,

1620
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,920
it would have expanded to about a millimeter.

1621
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,920
If we can capture gravitational waves

1622
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,920
on millimeter scales,

1623
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,920
literally we can look at the Big Bang,

1624
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,920
we can look at the Singularity.

1625
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,920
So that's very exciting,

1626
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,920
these are still being developed,

1627
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,920
it's very likely going to be decades

1628
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,920
before this is feasible,

1629
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,920
but there are actually prototypes already.

1630
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,920
So, I want to now explain,

1631
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,920
what I'm moving towards is explaining two things.

1632
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,920
One, why there are three families,

1633
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,920
I told you that would be explained,

1634
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,920
three generations of particles,

1635
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,920
and two, where did these waves,

1636
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,920
the density waves come from,

1637
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,920
that we see in the sky?

1638
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,920
Did they somehow originate

1639
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,920
at the Big Bang Singularity itself,

1640
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,920
and then move forward,

1641
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,920
and end up leading to the formation of galaxies,

1642
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,920
and stars, and so on.

1643
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
So, I'm going to explain that.

1644
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
Now, to understand that,

1645
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,920
we have to understand how

1646
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,920
the standard model couples to gravity,

1647
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,920
and currently there's a very fundamental paradox,

1648
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,920
in that coupling,

1649
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,920
which is that the standard model fields,

1650
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,920
electromagnetism, the electron fields,

1651
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,920
all the other fields,

1652
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,920
fluctuate in the vacuum, in empty space.

1653
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,920
The reason for those fluctuations

1654
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,920
are basically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

1655
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,920
If you try to set them zero,

1656
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,920
then they're,

1657
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,920
if you set their, essentially their position to zero,

1658
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,920
their coordinate,

1659
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,920
the amplitude of the wave to zero,

1660
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,920
then its velocity is indeterminate.

1661
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,920
You cannot set them to zero

1662
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,920
and be consistent with this Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

1663
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,920
This is a picture of what's going on

1664
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,920
in the vacuum right now,

1665
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,920
with either, like, this is actually

1666
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,920
for the strong interactions,

1667
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,920
but it would be the same for electromagnetism

1668
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,920
or other fields.

1669
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,920
Unfortunately, the energy

1670
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,920
in these zero point fluctuations is infinite.

1671
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,920
And that's a problem,

1672
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,920
but how do you couple it to gravity?

1673
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,920
So, we have various procedures

1674
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,920
to ignore that,

1675
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,920
but they are rather artificial

1676
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,920
and they leave you very confused.

1677
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,920
Somehow, something's going on in the vacuum,

1678
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,920
which seems deeply paradoxical.

1679
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,920
They also turn out to spoil this conformal symmetry

1680
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,920
and so therefore we cannot

1681
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,920
describe the Big Bang.

1682
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,920
So, our starting point was actually

1683
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,920
to take a clue from cosmology

1684
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,920
what kind of field, if it fluctuated,

1685
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,920
would lead to a pattern

1686
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,920
like the one we see on the sky.

1687
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,920
And turns out there's a unique answer.

1688
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,920
It's a dimension zero field.

1689
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,920
It's basically a field

1690
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,920
that is dimensionless.

1691
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,920
So, if you ask for its correlations

1692
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,920
of this field,

1693
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,920
it correlates on,

1694
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,920
there's no scale.

1695
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,920
Just like the fluctuations we see

1696
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,920
roughly the same strength on all scale,

1697
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,920
that's what this field has.

1698
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,920
And actually, these fields

1699
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,920
had been thought of before

1700
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,920
and they were shown to be

1701
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,920
a simple gauge theory in the 80s.

1702
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,920
So, here the standard model particles,

1703
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,920
what we discovered is if we add

1704
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,920
36 precisely

1705
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,920
of these extra dimension zero fields

1706
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,920
and you may wonder where the 36 comes from

1707
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,920
and the clue is that there's six of these

1708
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,920
and six of those,

1709
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,920
but I'm not going to say any more.

1710
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,920
Turns out these exactly cancel the zero point energy

1711
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,920
and they also restore the conformal symmetry.

1712
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,920
These are highly non-trivial cancellations

1713
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,920
and furthermore it only works

1714
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,920
if they're three generations.

1715
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,920
So, this is a very new discovery.

1716
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,920
We're trying to still make sense of it.

1717
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,920
These dimension zero fields are peculiar

1718
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,920
because they just change the vacuum,

1719
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,920
but they don't have any particles.

1720
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,920
So, not adding anything,

1721
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,920
you're just adjusting the vacuum

1722
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,920
of the standard model

1723
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,920
so that it doesn't have these violent energy fluctuations

1724
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,920
and it's consistent with this conformal symmetry

1725
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,920
that would allow you to describe the Big Bang.

1726
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,920
Бased on this, we were able to predict the amplitude

1727
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,920
and here it is, a big formula,

1728
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,920
but you see it all sorts of pys and fives

1729
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,920
and numbers, the number of degrees of freedom

1730
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,920
in the standard model.

1731
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,920
These alphas are couplings

1732
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,920
which are measured in experiments like CERN

1733
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,920
but the principles have explained

1734
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,920
that we want this conformal symmetry

1735
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,920
because we want to describe the Big Bang

1736
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,920
where apparently the universe was at zero size.

1737
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,920
So, we worked out all these numbers.

1738
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,920
This one in particular is interesting

1739
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,920
because alpha-3 is the strong coupling constant.

1740
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,920
We extrapolate it to the Planck scale.

1741
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,920
It's a huge extrapolation in energy

1742
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,920
and it turns out it is what is called a critical exponent.

1743
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,920
In other words, I told you there was a tilt,

1744
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,920
waves get slightly longer as you go to long wavelengths.

1745
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,920
This is how much stronger they get

1746
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,920
and this tilt has to be compared with 0.04.

1747
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,920
So, it turns out we plugged in this number

1748
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,920
from the CERN measurements, extrapolating the CERN measurements.

1749
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:57,920
The Planck scale in this number is exactly very close to 0.04.

1750
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,920
So, our prediction is 0.042.

1751
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,920
This is the measurement from the Planck satellite.

1752
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,920
So, that's just a first principles explanation.

1753
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,920
A lot more theoretical work is needed

1754
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,920
to confirm this, to calculate corrections,

1755
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,920
make sure they're under control.

1756
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,920
Observations are also improving.

1757
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,920
If this agreement holds up,

1758
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,920
then the theory will become compelling.

1759
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,920
So, it may be that we have an explanation of all this.

1760
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,920
It's all basically in the physics we know,

1761
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,920
is that we have to do something to fix up the vacuum a little,

1762
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,920
but otherwise cosmology is all under control.

1763
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,920
So, thank you for listening.

1764
01:06:46,920 --> 01:07:07,920
АПЛОДИСМЕНТЫ

1765
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,920
Alright, thank you, Neil.

1766
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,920
So captivated.

1767
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,920
I almost forgot to stand up to do the Q&A.

1768
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,920
So, we will now take some questions,

1769
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,920
both from the online audience and from the audience here.

1770
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,920
If you have a question, please come down to the microphone

1771
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,920
that is set up here on the stairs.

1772
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,920
And we'll just go with the Q

1773
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,920
and I'll bring up the online questions as well.

1774
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
So, if you're online listening,

1775
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,920
you can add a question with the hashtag PI live.

1776
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,920
So, we'll start while we let people come down.

1777
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,920
We'll start with an online question.

1778
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,920
So, let's see, what do we have?

1779
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,920
Here's one.

1780
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,920
So, I think this is a fun one to start with.

1781
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,920
Would the mirror universe be an identical reflection to this one

1782
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,920
with a mirror Earth moving,

1783
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,920
with a mirror Neil Tarak giving a mirror lecture?

1784
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
No.

1785
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,920
So, the thing is, you've got to clearly distinguish classical from quantum.

1786
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,920
Now, a quantum geometry is a fluctuating thing.

1787
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,920
So, when I draw this geometry,

1788
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,920
you shouldn't really picture a single geometry.

1789
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,920
You need to picture something that's a bit fuzzy.

1790
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,920
And it gets more and more fuzzy near the singularity.

1791
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,920
When the universe is small,

1792
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,920
that fuzziness means that could sort of,

1793
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,920
could quote singularity, could actually be moved around.

1794
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,920
There's some fuzziness.

1795
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,920
The way you impose the CPT symmetry is where the universe is large.

1796
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,920
So, if you like, there's a two-sided universe going out on either side.

1797
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,920
You impose a symmetry that if I turn the whole thing around,

1798
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,920
there's no difference.

1799
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,920
In both cases, there are fluctuations.

1800
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,920
So, it's really the CPT symmetry is a quantum symmetry.

1801
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,920
You shouldn't think literally that the two sides are carbon copies of each other.

1802
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:16,920
So, I think of it more as a sort of mathematical device

1803
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,920
to do something sensible with the singularity.

1804
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,920
And you don't do it at the singularity.

1805
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,920
Instead, you picture this extended spacetime

1806
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,920
and impose a symmetry on that.

1807
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,920
If you flip it around, that's what you do.

1808
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,920
Thanks.

1809
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,920
All right, we have a question from the audience.

1810
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,920
Go ahead.

1811
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,920
Hello.

1812
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,920
I'm not me.

1813
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,920
I'm my soon-to-be 87-year-old mom, Doris Matthews from Almyra.

1814
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,920
14 years into Alzheimer's

1815
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,920
and her third generation great grandchildren.

1816
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,920
The universe from within, from quantum to cosmos.

1817
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,920
Everything is a spring.

1818
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,920
High frequency compression to low frequency expansion,

1819
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,920
harmonic oscillation.

1820
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,920
Everything in our neighborhood.

1821
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,920
I'm a kid.

1822
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,920
1940.

1823
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,920
An imaginary time.

1824
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,920
Little girl in our park.

1825
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,920
Having a ball.

1826
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,920
Seasaws, waves in our sandbox.

1827
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,920
It's a blast.

1828
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,920
Is it true?

1829
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,920
The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.

1830
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,920
Tell me so I can tell my mom and dad.

1831
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,920
And we can tell our neighbors right here

1832
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,920
where we play in our park.

1833
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,920
Where Mother Nature teaches us everything.

1834
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,920
We can't wait.

1835
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,920
This is Waterloo.

1836
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,920
Our region, our perimeter.

1837
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,920
We are you, you are us.

1838
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,920
We are one.

1839
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
Connections.

1840
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,920
We are the big bang.

1841
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,920
The game of life.

1842
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,920
Come and play.

1843
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,920
Everything's A-OK.

1844
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,920
Our wade where the air is sweet.

1845
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,920
Mr. Turrick, can you tell me how to get to?

1846
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,920
Сасса миски.

1847
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,920
Пожалуйста, спасибо за это.

1848
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,920
Я должен сказать, что один из самых замечательных

1849
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,920
Meetings, которые я видел,

1850
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,920
были между Стивен Хоркин и Сидней Пватиэ,

1851
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,920
который, конечно, был легендарным актером.

1852
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,920
И они сидели на столе с другом.

1853
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,920
И Сидни сказал, что я думаю, что у нас есть.

1854
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,920
И Сидни, действительно, Had his own theory.

1855
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,920
Он не знал математики и так далее.

1856
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Но он абсолютно видел, как он думал, что надо работать.

1857
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,920
И это было просто абсолютно fascinating,

1858
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,920
видеть пасшену, с которой он сообщил.

1859
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,920
И Стивен был довольно встанутым с Сидней.

1860
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,920
Мы все имеем наши фотографии.

1861
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,920
И она абсолютно права.

1862
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,920
Это ничего, но история.

1863
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,920
Все физики — это просто история.

1864
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,920
Кто-то в нашем конференции, в этом вечере,

1865
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,920
очень хорошо сказал, что это narrative.

1866
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,920
Физика — это narrative.

1867
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,920
Это что-то, что мы говорим о том,

1868
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,920
о том, как мир behaving.

1869
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,920
Истороннее, что о физике,

1870
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,920
это narrative converges.

1871
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,920
Мы можем использовать это.

1872
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,920
И это у нас невероятная мощь.

1873
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,920
Но в конце концов, это просто история.

1874
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,920
Отлично.

1875
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,920
У нас есть еще один вопрос от audiences.

1876
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,920
Спасибо, профессор Турак, за поговоре.

1877
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,920
У меня два вопроса.

1878
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,920
Один вопрос — когда мы думаем о том,

1879
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,920
что Биг-Банг происходит 13.8 миллионов лет назад,

1880
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,920
кажется, что революция говорит нам, что время relative.

1881
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,920
Так что, может Биг-Банг быть визжанным

1882
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,920
как что-то, которое постоянно происходит,

1883
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,920
как у нас есть своя своя своя спина?

1884
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,920
Как у нас есть постоянный феномен.

1885
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,920
Как вы говорите в начале,

1886
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,920
кажется, что это 14 миллионов лет назад,

1887
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,920
но это у нас есть своя своя своя спина.

1888
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,920
Ну, когда мы говорим о 14 миллион лет назад,

1889
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:20,920
то это, как мы говорили,

1890
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,920
hours,

1891
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,920
hours,

1892
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,920
hours…

1893
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,920
45%

1894
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,920
An hour,

1895
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,920
40%

1896
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:46,920
An hour,

1897
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,920
40%

1898
01:13:50,920 --> 01:14:00,760
сингулярность, это 13.7 миллионов лет, но я не уверен, что я fully understand the question,

1899
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:12,120
но это точно вероятно, что время в General relativity is, you know, is different objects,

1900
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:19,600
different observers see different times, но это мы, вы знаете, мы понимаем, мы

1901
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,840
believe that at the end of the story is remarkably simple.

1902
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:30,560
Что кажется, что сингулярность в Бигбанге, это notion of time, я mean,

1903
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,920
if this picture is correct, то notion of time becomes meaningless, почему?

1904
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:42,680
Потому что все это становится светлым, литерально то, что есть свет,

1905
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,520
свет не видит экспансион в мире, свет не видит время, если

1906
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:54,280
ты asks a photon what's the time, a photon will tell you I see the whole universe all of existence

1907
01:14:54,280 --> 01:15:01,640
simultaneous, ок, so photons are pretty amazing things, which have no time,

1908
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:09,600
no notion of time, and that seems to be, if this is right, how you deal with the singularity,

1909
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:16,600
there was no time at the Big Bang, or at least there was nothing around to witness the time.

1910
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:25,040
Thank you, and just because you had that sort of the expansion on like the universe that we

1911
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:31,400
observe in your sort of universe, sort of mirror model, and I think Penrose had developed the

1912
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:39,240
conformal cosmic psychology, so I mean, I don't know if that makes any sense from your model,

1913
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:45,560
but as the universe becomes all black holes, and then the radiation and heat death, would that be

1914
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:50,760
where it connects on, like it connects in the middle, but would it connect to the universe at the heat death?

1915
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:57,640
No, I mean, I have the greatest possible respect for Penrose's ideas, and as I indicated,

1916
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:03,760
what we're connecting it is an idea of his from the 70s, which is about the singularity.

1917
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:10,640
Since then, he started to advocate this cyclic universe picture, I think partly influenced by myself

1918
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:17,520
and Paul Steinhardt, because we talked about cyclic, whereas I've abandoned that, it's too complicated,

1919
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,960
he is now advocating it, but the problem is that he doesn't really have a way to match

1920
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:30,960
the future of our universe to the big bang of the next one.

1921
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:37,360
He doesn't have a mathematical prescription for how you, he has a prescription, but it doesn't really work,

1922
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:48,080
and yeah, it's, whereas what we're doing here is this, is called analytic, it means that it's unique,

1923
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:55,280
the connection between these two sides, so, but, you know, we're in discussion about it,

1924
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:59,040
I'm trying to persuade him that your previous idea was much better than this one,

1925
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:06,160
but we'll see, I mean, it could well be that he turns out to be right, he has turned out to be right on

1926
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,960
very, very many things. Thank you.

1927
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,600
Thank you. All right, we have another question.

1928
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:19,040
Thank you very much for the nice talk. I was wondering about one remark, which you made,

1929
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:24,400
about the production of the right-handed neutrinos, and so if I understood it correctly,

1930
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:29,200
it would be like a Hawking radiation effect from the early universe, and normally Hawking

1931
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:34,000
radiation is associated with some kind of horizon, or some cosmological horizon.

1932
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:40,160
If we are now in this regime of very early times and the scale factor is linear,

1933
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:47,600
there's no horizon. Yes, so I met, okay, so it's, it's good you ask. So at some level,

1934
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,960
it's totally obvious to suggest the right-handed neutrinos, the dark matter,

1935
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,720
because it doesn't couple to light or other forces. Why wasn't this done in the 70s?

1936
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:02,480
And the reason was that everybody thought that the abundance of particles are determined by thermal

1937
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:09,280
equilibrium in the hot big bang. If you switch off this coupling so that it's stable and can be

1938
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:15,440
the dark matter, it was never in thermal equilibrium, so they didn't know how to calculate its abundance,

1939
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,520
so they assumed that wasn't the case. And literally, they made the assumption

1940
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:25,120
just so they didn't have to worry about it, okay. Now, so we did worry about it,

1941
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,720
because we wanted it to be the dark matter. And, and then when I said Hawking radiation,

1942
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:36,880
what I really meant is it's the time dependence of the cosmology that creates the particles.

1943
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,760
So it's not with a horizon, with a black hole, it's associated with a horizon.

1944
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:48,080
But in general, if space changes, the scale factor changes, you produce particles.

1945
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:54,080
It's much more general than having a horizon. And in this case, that's what happens. It's just the,

1946
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:59,200
the mere fact the universe is changing in size, creates a particle. Thank you.

1947
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,760
All right, we have time for a couple more questions. Go ahead.

1948
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:08,560
Hi there. You had mentioned that an explanation for dark matter could be right-handed neutrinos.

1949
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,480
Yes. But that relied on a left-handed neutrino being massless.

1950
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:18,000
Yes. My question to you is, have we not measured the mass of a left-handed neutrino to be nonzero?

1951
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,720
No, great question. So what has been measured, there are three neutrinos,

1952
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:28,160
three light neutrinos, we know of. The only things that have been measured are the differences

1953
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:35,520
in actually the squares of the masses of those three neutrinos. So we know two numbers.

1954
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,560
We know essentially two differences between the light neutrino masses.

1955
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:46,240
We do not know the overall scale. So our prediction is that we have these three masses

1956
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:52,080
and the lightest one is massless. So we predict all the masses from that, from the known measurements.

1957
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,560
And what these galaxy surveys are going to do in the next three to five years is

1958
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:07,120
fix the sum of these neutrino masses. So if they find the sum is essentially

1959
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:13,280
just the sum of those two differences, then it will confirm that the lightest one is massless.

1960
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,680
Thank you. That's a great question. All right, let's take one final question from the audience.

1961
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:25,600
Thank you for the lecture. It was amazing. My question is just, you were talking about these sort of

1962
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:31,120
mirror, this sort of mirror universe that is similar to ours at cosmological scales,

1963
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:38,080
but not identical because of fluctuations close to the Big Bang. Feynman sort of had this idea of

1964
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,880
electrons and positrons being not separate particles, but merely the same particle traveling in

1965
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:52,240
different directions in time. Could those particles travel between our universe and this

1966
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:59,120
mirror universe through the singularity because, you know, to positron and electron collide?

1967
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:07,040
It's a great question. There is this very fundamental view of antimatter as just being matter that's

1968
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:16,480
struggling backwards in time. And in fact, Feynman, the greatest expert on all this, made the statement

1969
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:21,760
that he believed quantum field theory, which is what we use to describe the standard model,

1970
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,240
was nothing but a way of hiding the fact that particles go backwards in time.

1971
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:37,360
So, indeed, this CPT is, you see, if I have a particle traveling from A to B with a world line

1972
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:44,400
from it, and that, let's imagine, time goes up and space sideways. So this, the particle can go

1973
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:49,760
forwards and backwards in time and so on. What is CPT? It's just reversing the arrow on that line.

1974
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,280
So instead of going from here to there, it goes from here to there, that's CPT.

1975
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:02,400
And, indeed, that must be possible. Okay, so somehow we're doing the same thing with the cosmos,

1976
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,640
but one way of picturing this two-sided diagram is that it's really a U-shape

1977
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,800
and you can imagine a universe going backwards in time for a while and then turning around and going forwards.

1978
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:22,240
Реконсайлинг these pictures of the particles and the universe is something we still have not done

1979
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,760
and it should be fruitful, but I don't quite know how to do it yet.

1980
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,960
Still working on it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, you have a quick question? Okay, yep.

1981
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,040
I was sitting there and I was thinking,

1982
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,720
this is very complex and I can understand why you haven't come back from

1983
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:53,520
Britain because you were having too much fun, but I'm thinking that

1984
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:03,680
if we start from the very basics, existence, what is existence?

1985
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:13,040
How did it, how did it appear? I mean, we're sort of going after the second step

1986
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:18,400
of looking at the ball bearings in the world. No, you're absolutely right.

1987
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,360
The more basic the question, the harder it is to answer.

1988
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,440
So all physics is doing is sort of following our nose and trying to figure out

1989
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:35,040
what might we learn next, but the motivation is exactly what you say.

1990
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:43,280
We're trying to understand what the hell is going on in a very big sense.

1991
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,080
Why is there existence? We don't know. The best we can do is...

1992
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:54,080
That should hint to what all these molecules and everything is about.

1993
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,760
It would be called enlightenment.

1994
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,640
That's a lovely thought to end on, so thank you very much, Neil.
