0	14080	This structure built some 12,000 years ago, that 6,000 years before Stonehenge, 5,000
14080	19460	years before the first pyramid, highlights that for millennia, humans have used the engineering
19460	23640	method to solve problems long before the rise of science.
23640	28600	In this video, I define and illustrate the essence of the engineering method.
28600	33000	This is called Bekle Tepa, an ancient ruin in southeastern Turkey.
33000	37360	Stone structures cover 9 hectares, about 18 football fields.
37360	40840	Filled with circular rooms, its purpose remains a mystery.
40840	45080	Embedded in the stone walls of the rooms are decorative T-shaped pillars.
45080	55280	Carved into the pillars are lions, bears, wild boars, lizards, spiders, and surprisingly,
55280	56920	ducks.
56920	61680	Not only are the stones beautifully carved, they are placed with precision.
61680	66200	To see the degree of precision, look at the circular room I showed you initially.
66200	71400	At the center are the remains of two T-pillars the tops fell off long ago.
71400	75880	If we look at this room from above, keep your eye on the two central pillars highlighted
75880	82520	in red, you see two circular rooms nearby, which each have the same arrangement of pillars
82520	84120	at their center.
84120	89040	The pillars in the two rooms at the bottom sit on a line with little deviation.
89040	93920	If we locate the exact centers between the pillars and the two lower circles and connect
93920	99120	them to the center of pillars in the circle above, we inscribe an equilateral triangle
99120	103620	its sides deviate less than 1.5% from perfection.
103620	109040	This is unlikely to be coincidental, nor the result of some self-organization.
109040	115200	My point is that these stones are erected in a purposefully designed layout, not haphazard,
115200	121520	that responds to societal needs, which means that Gobekli Tepa is an engineered object.
121520	127240	The people of Gobekli Tepa created all this by applying the engineering method.
127240	134000	The method we still use today, yet this powerful method, the engineering method, is an all-but-hidden
134000	138320	process that few of us have heard of that alone understand.
138320	142520	Even though it influences every aspect of our lives.
142520	146920	In this video series, I explore the essence of that engineering method.
146920	152720	The age of Gobekli Tepa highlights that the engineering method long predates science,
152720	158360	which conflicts with a commonplace notion that engineering somehow arises from the scientific
158360	159760	method.
159760	164480	So I start by asking, do engineers need science?
164480	168200	And here's the answer.
168200	174520	This is a model of Saint-Chapelle, a stunning 13th-century building built nearly 12,000
174520	176960	years after Gobekli Tepa.
176960	182440	Saint-Chapelle is designed and constructed by a team who had never learned basic arithmetic
182440	187080	or the geometry taught today in third grade that alone anything we'd call science.
187080	193320	In fact, they had no standardized length because a foot varied from region to region.
193320	197800	The medieval engineers aspired to create a building that celebrated a spiritual world
197800	201480	by streaming light through the structure's walls.
201480	206960	Sunlight was transformed by the stained glass windows into a diffuse red, blue, and gold
206960	211200	that glimmers on the chapel sculptures and gilded arches.
211200	216360	To create these stunning displays of light, to house these giant stained glass windows,
216360	220640	they built vast walls by constructing spectacularly high ceilings.
220640	225440	How did these engineers, called masons, know how to carve a cathedral's thousands of building
225440	230880	blocks to create when assembled not only beauty, but also stability?
230880	234160	Like all great engineers, they drew on past knowledge.
234160	239120	They used an architectural element that originated in present-day Pakistan.
239120	244040	Notice that Saint-Chapelle has, as do all cathedrals, pointed arches, some six on the
244040	251800	front, at least ten on each side, and on the back six more.
251840	257040	And of course, many pointed arches support the ceiling.
257040	261280	They chose this pointed arch over the arch used in the Roman's extraordinary pantheon,
261280	265480	built about 1400 years before Saint-Chapelle.
265480	271200	The pantheon, typical of all imperial Roman architecture, features a semi-circular arch.
271200	273920	It is exactly half of a circle.
273920	279080	If a medieval engineer used a semi-circular Roman arch to construct a soaring cathedral,
279080	285360	it would cover entire city blocks and use so much stone that the cost would skyrocket.
285360	290480	The savings from using a pointed arch instead of a semi-circular arch can be seen clearly
290480	294480	by comparing Saint-Chapelle with the pantheon.
294480	298440	Notice how Saint-Chapelle is nearly the same height as the pantheon, yet just a little
298440	300760	over a third is wide.
300760	305760	This Roman semi-circular arch was rejected by medieval engineers because its width has
305760	308640	to grow proportionally to its height.
308640	313600	To see the problem, consider a semi-circular arch that is 10 meters in width.
313600	317080	It is 5 meters in height because it's half of a circle.
317080	320120	So its height is half of the diameter.
320120	325720	Now, if I double the span covered from 10 meters to 20 meters, you see that the height
325720	326720	is now 10 meters.
326720	330120	It has doubled.
330120	332080	Contrast this to the pointed arch.
332080	336680	As the arch increases in height, the span covered can stay the same because the shape
336680	339960	of the arch can change as its height increases.
339960	345000	Although medieval engineers didn't adopt the Roman semi-circular arch, from the Romans
345000	349720	they inherited the key idea that enabled them to build their stunning cathedrals that have
349720	351520	stood for centuries.
351520	355880	We can see it in this arch from Saint-Chapelle.
355880	360720	To support this arch, the medieval engineers had to correctly size the thickness of this
360720	361720	wall.
361720	366320	If this wall were too thin, the weight of the arch would buckle the wall, the structure
366360	367800	would collapse.
367800	373280	If too thick, stone would be wasted at a huge cost and the desired open space inside the
373280	375480	cathedral diminished.
375480	380000	To size the wall, the medieval builder used a rule that created the stable semi-circular
380000	381960	arches of the pantheon.
381960	387120	A stable arch results when the supporting wall's thickness is between a fourth or a
387120	389560	fifth of the arch's span.
389560	394120	If an arch's span were this long, then you divide it into about four equal parts and
394160	397320	use one of these to size the wall's thickness.
397320	400880	But there's a problem with applying this proportional rule.
400880	406000	The Mason's knew no mathematics, nor, as I've said, they even have a ruler.
406000	411080	So this rule was not a calculation, but was instead an action.
411080	417040	The Mason would have a life-size chalk drawing of the interior of this arch on the floor
417040	419040	of the drawing room.
419040	424600	Instead, I've drawn the interior of a pointed arch on a large sheet of paper.
424600	429080	In addition to this arch drawing or template, you need a piece of string the Mason would
429080	430760	have used to rope.
430760	435360	I need to drape it over the arch, so I'll insert map pins along the arch to support
435360	436360	the string.
436360	440760	The Mason would have done this on the floor, so he would simply lay the rope on top of
440760	442280	his drawing.
442280	448760	Now, drape the rope over the arch, mark the string at the base of the arch, and then
448880	453880	cut the string, so it's only as long as the arch.
459880	463960	Next, lay the string on the ground and fold it into thirds.
463960	469160	I've marked the thirds with pink tape here the Mason would have used colored chalk.
469160	473320	That thirds isn't obvious, but it will get us to a wall thickness of about a fourth or
473320	475000	a fifth.
475000	480400	With the rope now marked into three sections of equal length, return it to its original
480400	482760	place along the arch template.
482760	487040	We see that this divides the arch into three equal sections.
487040	492040	Let's mark one of them.
492040	497040	Then pin one end of a new string to that marked spot.
498040	503040	Draw a taut, and pin it to the base of the arch.
512040	517040	We need to attach to the base a length of string exactly equal to the distance from
517040	522040	the spot a third of the way along the arch to the base, so I just fold the rope and mark it.
523040	528040	And then draw that taut in a straight line with the pin section.
528040	530040	Then pin it to the base.
530040	535040	The distance from that pin to the inner line is the width of the wall, which will be between
535040	538040	a fourth and a fifth of the arch's span.
538040	541040	Let's compare it to the arch section from Saint Chapelle.
541040	545040	If I superimpose it on the string construction, you can see that it matches.
545040	550040	It's puzzling that we divided the arch into three sections, which yield a width between
550040	555040	a fourth and a fifth, but that's just how the geometry works out.
555040	557040	That's part of the rule.
557040	561040	I've never worked out why geometrically that works, because it doesn't matter.
561040	565040	The Mason would never have worked it out analytically.
565040	569040	What matters, and that's the point here, is that it works.
569040	575040	And to belabor the point a bit, it's the same rule the Romans used to size their supporting walls.
575040	581040	Divide the interior of a Roman semi-circular arch into three equal size sections,
581040	586040	draw a line from one of these third markings to the base of the arch, then double it,
586040	591040	and you see the wall size of a bit less than a fourth of the interior arch's span.
591040	595040	With that rule, we've arrived at the core of the engineering method.
595040	600040	The proportional rule doesn't come from some scientific analysis of stone and its properties.
600040	604040	It comes from centuries of experience, from trial and error.
604040	608040	It's called the rule of thumb, more formally a heuristic.
608040	613040	An imprecise method used as a shortcut to find the solution to a problem,
613040	616040	often by narrowing the range of possible solutions.
616040	620040	Here, a Mason sized the walls width in a matter of minutes,
620040	624040	without understanding the fundamental material properties of stone,
624040	628040	and without understanding the mathematics needed to apply the rule.
628040	631040	That's a paradigm for the engineering method.
631040	634040	Solving problems using rules of thumb
634040	639040	that cause the best change in a poorly understood situation using available resources.
639040	642040	That's a sharp contrast with the scientific method,
642040	648040	because these rules of thumb are only guides that offer a high probability of success, but no guarantee.
648040	654040	And unlike a scientific theory, a rule of thumb is never in a sense disproved.
654040	657040	That hundreds of cathedrals are still around today,
657040	661040	standing for eight or nine hundred years is proof of that.
661040	665040	Instead of being disproved, this rule of thumb for stone became outdated,
665040	669040	not wrong, as iron and steel I-beams replace stone.
669040	672040	Yet no doubt there's a question in your mind.
672040	676040	I've talked about buildings constructed eight or so centuries ago.
676040	678040	So surely you might wonder,
678040	682040	is engineering based on rules of thumb antiquated in our scientific age?
683040	687040	That line of thought misunderstands the purpose of the engineering method,
687040	693040	which is to solve practical problems before we have full scientific knowledge.
693040	697040	In the next video, I'll explore how engineers work their way around
697040	701040	that lack of scientific understanding, how they overcome uncertainty.
701040	704040	I'm Bill Hammack, the Engineer Guy.
712040	715040	Thank you.
