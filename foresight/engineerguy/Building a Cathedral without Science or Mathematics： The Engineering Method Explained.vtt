00:00.000 --> 00:14.080
This structure built some 12,000 years ago, that 6,000 years before Stonehenge, 5,000

00:14.080 --> 00:19.460
years before the first pyramid, highlights that for millennia, humans have used the engineering

00:19.460 --> 00:23.640
method to solve problems long before the rise of science.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.600
In this video, I define and illustrate the essence of the engineering method.

00:28.600 --> 00:33.000
This is called Bekle Tepa, an ancient ruin in southeastern Turkey.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.360
Stone structures cover 9 hectares, about 18 football fields.

00:37.360 --> 00:40.840
Filled with circular rooms, its purpose remains a mystery.

00:40.840 --> 00:45.080
Embedded in the stone walls of the rooms are decorative T-shaped pillars.

00:45.080 --> 00:55.280
Carved into the pillars are lions, bears, wild boars, lizards, spiders, and surprisingly,

00:55.280 --> 00:56.920
ducks.

00:56.920 --> 01:01.680
Not only are the stones beautifully carved, they are placed with precision.

01:01.680 --> 01:06.200
To see the degree of precision, look at the circular room I showed you initially.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.400
At the center are the remains of two T-pillars the tops fell off long ago.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.880
If we look at this room from above, keep your eye on the two central pillars highlighted

01:15.880 --> 01:22.520
in red, you see two circular rooms nearby, which each have the same arrangement of pillars

01:22.520 --> 01:24.120
at their center.

01:24.120 --> 01:29.040
The pillars in the two rooms at the bottom sit on a line with little deviation.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.920
If we locate the exact centers between the pillars and the two lower circles and connect

01:33.920 --> 01:39.120
them to the center of pillars in the circle above, we inscribe an equilateral triangle

01:39.120 --> 01:43.620
its sides deviate less than 1.5% from perfection.

01:43.620 --> 01:49.040
This is unlikely to be coincidental, nor the result of some self-organization.

01:49.040 --> 01:55.200
My point is that these stones are erected in a purposefully designed layout, not haphazard,

01:55.200 --> 02:01.520
that responds to societal needs, which means that Gobekli Tepa is an engineered object.

02:01.520 --> 02:07.240
The people of Gobekli Tepa created all this by applying the engineering method.

02:07.240 --> 02:14.000
The method we still use today, yet this powerful method, the engineering method, is an all-but-hidden

02:14.000 --> 02:18.320
process that few of us have heard of that alone understand.

02:18.320 --> 02:22.520
Even though it influences every aspect of our lives.

02:22.520 --> 02:26.920
In this video series, I explore the essence of that engineering method.

02:26.920 --> 02:32.720
The age of Gobekli Tepa highlights that the engineering method long predates science,

02:32.720 --> 02:38.360
which conflicts with a commonplace notion that engineering somehow arises from the scientific

02:38.360 --> 02:39.760
method.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.480
So I start by asking, do engineers need science?

02:44.480 --> 02:48.200
And here's the answer.

02:48.200 --> 02:54.520
This is a model of Saint-Chapelle, a stunning 13th-century building built nearly 12,000

02:54.520 --> 02:56.960
years after Gobekli Tepa.

02:56.960 --> 03:02.440
Saint-Chapelle is designed and constructed by a team who had never learned basic arithmetic

03:02.440 --> 03:07.080
or the geometry taught today in third grade that alone anything we'd call science.

03:07.080 --> 03:13.320
In fact, they had no standardized length because a foot varied from region to region.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.800
The medieval engineers aspired to create a building that celebrated a spiritual world

03:17.800 --> 03:21.480
by streaming light through the structure's walls.

03:21.480 --> 03:26.960
Sunlight was transformed by the stained glass windows into a diffuse red, blue, and gold

03:26.960 --> 03:31.200
that glimmers on the chapel sculptures and gilded arches.

03:31.200 --> 03:36.360
To create these stunning displays of light, to house these giant stained glass windows,

03:36.360 --> 03:40.640
they built vast walls by constructing spectacularly high ceilings.

03:40.640 --> 03:45.440
How did these engineers, called masons, know how to carve a cathedral's thousands of building

03:45.440 --> 03:50.880
blocks to create when assembled not only beauty, but also stability?

03:50.880 --> 03:54.160
Like all great engineers, they drew on past knowledge.

03:54.160 --> 03:59.120
They used an architectural element that originated in present-day Pakistan.

03:59.120 --> 04:04.040
Notice that Saint-Chapelle has, as do all cathedrals, pointed arches, some six on the

04:04.040 --> 04:11.800
front, at least ten on each side, and on the back six more.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.040
And of course, many pointed arches support the ceiling.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.280
They chose this pointed arch over the arch used in the Roman's extraordinary pantheon,

04:21.280 --> 04:25.480
built about 1400 years before Saint-Chapelle.

04:25.480 --> 04:31.200
The pantheon, typical of all imperial Roman architecture, features a semi-circular arch.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.920
It is exactly half of a circle.

04:33.920 --> 04:39.080
If a medieval engineer used a semi-circular Roman arch to construct a soaring cathedral,

04:39.080 --> 04:45.360
it would cover entire city blocks and use so much stone that the cost would skyrocket.

04:45.360 --> 04:50.480
The savings from using a pointed arch instead of a semi-circular arch can be seen clearly

04:50.480 --> 04:54.480
by comparing Saint-Chapelle with the pantheon.

04:54.480 --> 04:58.440
Notice how Saint-Chapelle is nearly the same height as the pantheon, yet just a little

04:58.440 --> 05:00.760
over a third is wide.

05:00.760 --> 05:05.760
This Roman semi-circular arch was rejected by medieval engineers because its width has

05:05.760 --> 05:08.640
to grow proportionally to its height.

05:08.640 --> 05:13.600
To see the problem, consider a semi-circular arch that is 10 meters in width.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.080
It is 5 meters in height because it's half of a circle.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.120
So its height is half of the diameter.

05:20.120 --> 05:25.720
Now, if I double the span covered from 10 meters to 20 meters, you see that the height

05:25.720 --> 05:26.720
is now 10 meters.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.120
It has doubled.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.080
Contrast this to the pointed arch.

05:32.080 --> 05:36.680
As the arch increases in height, the span covered can stay the same because the shape

05:36.680 --> 05:39.960
of the arch can change as its height increases.

05:39.960 --> 05:45.000
Although medieval engineers didn't adopt the Roman semi-circular arch, from the Romans

05:45.000 --> 05:49.720
they inherited the key idea that enabled them to build their stunning cathedrals that have

05:49.720 --> 05:51.520
stood for centuries.

05:51.520 --> 05:55.880
We can see it in this arch from Saint-Chapelle.

05:55.880 --> 06:00.720
To support this arch, the medieval engineers had to correctly size the thickness of this

06:00.720 --> 06:01.720
wall.

06:01.720 --> 06:06.320
If this wall were too thin, the weight of the arch would buckle the wall, the structure

06:06.360 --> 06:07.800
would collapse.

06:07.800 --> 06:13.280
If too thick, stone would be wasted at a huge cost and the desired open space inside the

06:13.280 --> 06:15.480
cathedral diminished.

06:15.480 --> 06:20.000
To size the wall, the medieval builder used a rule that created the stable semi-circular

06:20.000 --> 06:21.960
arches of the pantheon.

06:21.960 --> 06:27.120
A stable arch results when the supporting wall's thickness is between a fourth or a

06:27.120 --> 06:29.560
fifth of the arch's span.

06:29.560 --> 06:34.120
If an arch's span were this long, then you divide it into about four equal parts and

06:34.160 --> 06:37.320
use one of these to size the wall's thickness.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.880
But there's a problem with applying this proportional rule.

06:40.880 --> 06:46.000
The Mason's knew no mathematics, nor, as I've said, they even have a ruler.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.080
So this rule was not a calculation, but was instead an action.

06:51.080 --> 06:57.040
The Mason would have a life-size chalk drawing of the interior of this arch on the floor

06:57.040 --> 06:59.040
of the drawing room.

06:59.040 --> 07:04.600
Instead, I've drawn the interior of a pointed arch on a large sheet of paper.

07:04.600 --> 07:09.080
In addition to this arch drawing or template, you need a piece of string the Mason would

07:09.080 --> 07:10.760
have used to rope.

07:10.760 --> 07:15.360
I need to drape it over the arch, so I'll insert map pins along the arch to support

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
the string.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.760
The Mason would have done this on the floor, so he would simply lay the rope on top of

07:20.760 --> 07:22.280
his drawing.

07:22.280 --> 07:28.760
Now, drape the rope over the arch, mark the string at the base of the arch, and then

07:28.880 --> 07:33.880
cut the string, so it's only as long as the arch.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.960
Next, lay the string on the ground and fold it into thirds.

07:43.960 --> 07:49.160
I've marked the thirds with pink tape here the Mason would have used colored chalk.

07:49.160 --> 07:53.320
That thirds isn't obvious, but it will get us to a wall thickness of about a fourth or

07:53.320 --> 07:55.000
a fifth.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.400
With the rope now marked into three sections of equal length, return it to its original

08:00.400 --> 08:02.760
place along the arch template.

08:02.760 --> 08:07.040
We see that this divides the arch into three equal sections.

08:07.040 --> 08:12.040
Let's mark one of them.

08:12.040 --> 08:17.040
Then pin one end of a new string to that marked spot.

08:18.040 --> 08:23.040
Draw a taut, and pin it to the base of the arch.

08:32.040 --> 08:37.040
We need to attach to the base a length of string exactly equal to the distance from

08:37.040 --> 08:42.040
the spot a third of the way along the arch to the base, so I just fold the rope and mark it.

08:43.040 --> 08:48.040
And then draw that taut in a straight line with the pin section.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.040
Then pin it to the base.

08:50.040 --> 08:55.040
The distance from that pin to the inner line is the width of the wall, which will be between

08:55.040 --> 08:58.040
a fourth and a fifth of the arch's span.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.040
Let's compare it to the arch section from Saint Chapelle.

09:01.040 --> 09:05.040
If I superimpose it on the string construction, you can see that it matches.

09:05.040 --> 09:10.040
It's puzzling that we divided the arch into three sections, which yield a width between

09:10.040 --> 09:15.040
a fourth and a fifth, but that's just how the geometry works out.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
That's part of the rule.

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
I've never worked out why geometrically that works, because it doesn't matter.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.040
The Mason would never have worked it out analytically.

09:25.040 --> 09:29.040
What matters, and that's the point here, is that it works.

09:29.040 --> 09:35.040
And to belabor the point a bit, it's the same rule the Romans used to size their supporting walls.

09:35.040 --> 09:41.040
Divide the interior of a Roman semi-circular arch into three equal size sections,

09:41.040 --> 09:46.040
draw a line from one of these third markings to the base of the arch, then double it,

09:46.040 --> 09:51.040
and you see the wall size of a bit less than a fourth of the interior arch's span.

09:51.040 --> 09:55.040
With that rule, we've arrived at the core of the engineering method.

09:55.040 --> 10:00.040
The proportional rule doesn't come from some scientific analysis of stone and its properties.

10:00.040 --> 10:04.040
It comes from centuries of experience, from trial and error.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.040
It's called the rule of thumb, more formally a heuristic.

10:08.040 --> 10:13.040
An imprecise method used as a shortcut to find the solution to a problem,

10:13.040 --> 10:16.040
often by narrowing the range of possible solutions.

10:16.040 --> 10:20.040
Here, a Mason sized the walls width in a matter of minutes,

10:20.040 --> 10:24.040
without understanding the fundamental material properties of stone,

10:24.040 --> 10:28.040
and without understanding the mathematics needed to apply the rule.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.040
That's a paradigm for the engineering method.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.040
Solving problems using rules of thumb

10:34.040 --> 10:39.040
that cause the best change in a poorly understood situation using available resources.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.040
That's a sharp contrast with the scientific method,

10:42.040 --> 10:48.040
because these rules of thumb are only guides that offer a high probability of success, but no guarantee.

10:48.040 --> 10:54.040
And unlike a scientific theory, a rule of thumb is never in a sense disproved.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.040
That hundreds of cathedrals are still around today,

10:57.040 --> 11:01.040
standing for eight or nine hundred years is proof of that.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.040
Instead of being disproved, this rule of thumb for stone became outdated,

11:05.040 --> 11:09.040
not wrong, as iron and steel I-beams replace stone.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.040
Yet no doubt there's a question in your mind.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.040
I've talked about buildings constructed eight or so centuries ago.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.040
So surely you might wonder,

11:18.040 --> 11:22.040
is engineering based on rules of thumb antiquated in our scientific age?

11:23.040 --> 11:27.040
That line of thought misunderstands the purpose of the engineering method,

11:27.040 --> 11:33.040
which is to solve practical problems before we have full scientific knowledge.

11:33.040 --> 11:37.040
In the next video, I'll explore how engineers work their way around

11:37.040 --> 11:41.040
that lack of scientific understanding, how they overcome uncertainty.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.040
I'm Bill Hammack, the Engineer Guy.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.040
Thank you.
