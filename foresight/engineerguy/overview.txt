 In this video, The Engineer Guy explains how Medieval Masons used a rule of thumb to determine the width of walls when constructing buildings like cathedrals. This method was not derived from a scientific understanding but rather from centuries of empirical experience and trial and error. The process involved dividing the interior span of a pointed arch into three equal parts, drawing a line from one of these points to the base of the arch, and then doubling that distance to get the width of the wall. This rule resulted in a wall thickness that was approximately a fourth or a fifth of the arch's span, which proved to be effective for the structural integrity of the buildings.

The engineering method relies on such heuristics—practical rules of thumb—that guide solutions to problems without full scientific understanding. These rules are based on historical success and are used as a starting point when dealing with new challenges. The method is not outdated; rather, it remains relevant because it addresses practical issues before complete scientific knowledge is available.

Engineers use similar heuristic approaches today to solve problems when full scientific principles are not yet known or when they need a quick, reliable solution. These rules of thumb offer high probabilities of success but do not guarantee it, and they can be refined over time as more information becomes available. The longevity of medieval structures built using these methods is evidence of their effectiveness.

The video emphasizes that the engineering method is about problem-solving in a practical, real-world context, often with limited knowledge, and that rules of thumb continue to be valuable in the scientific age, especially when dealing with new technologies or uncharted territories in engineering.
