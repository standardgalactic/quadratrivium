1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,080
This structure built some 12,000 years ago, that 6,000 years before Stonehenge, 5,000

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,460
years before the first pyramid, highlights that for millennia, humans have used the engineering

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,640
method to solve problems long before the rise of science.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,600
In this video, I define and illustrate the essence of the engineering method.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,000
This is called Bekle Tepa, an ancient ruin in southeastern Turkey.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,360
Stone structures cover 9 hectares, about 18 football fields.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,840
Filled with circular rooms, its purpose remains a mystery.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,080
Embedded in the stone walls of the rooms are decorative T-shaped pillars.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:55,280
Carved into the pillars are lions, bears, wild boars, lizards, spiders, and surprisingly,

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,920
ducks.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,680
Not only are the stones beautifully carved, they are placed with precision.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,200
To see the degree of precision, look at the circular room I showed you initially.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,400
At the center are the remains of two T-pillars the tops fell off long ago.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,880
If we look at this room from above, keep your eye on the two central pillars highlighted

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,520
in red, you see two circular rooms nearby, which each have the same arrangement of pillars

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,120
at their center.

17
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,040
The pillars in the two rooms at the bottom sit on a line with little deviation.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,920
If we locate the exact centers between the pillars and the two lower circles and connect

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,120
them to the center of pillars in the circle above, we inscribe an equilateral triangle

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,620
its sides deviate less than 1.5% from perfection.

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,040
This is unlikely to be coincidental, nor the result of some self-organization.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,200
My point is that these stones are erected in a purposefully designed layout, not haphazard,

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,520
that responds to societal needs, which means that Gobekli Tepa is an engineered object.

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,240
The people of Gobekli Tepa created all this by applying the engineering method.

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,000
The method we still use today, yet this powerful method, the engineering method, is an all-but-hidden

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,320
process that few of us have heard of that alone understand.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,520
Even though it influences every aspect of our lives.

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,920
In this video series, I explore the essence of that engineering method.

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,720
The age of Gobekli Tepa highlights that the engineering method long predates science,

30
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,360
which conflicts with a commonplace notion that engineering somehow arises from the scientific

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
method.

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,480
So I start by asking, do engineers need science?

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,200
And here's the answer.

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,520
This is a model of Saint-Chapelle, a stunning 13th-century building built nearly 12,000

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,960
years after Gobekli Tepa.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,440
Saint-Chapelle is designed and constructed by a team who had never learned basic arithmetic

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,080
or the geometry taught today in third grade that alone anything we'd call science.

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,320
In fact, they had no standardized length because a foot varied from region to region.

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,800
The medieval engineers aspired to create a building that celebrated a spiritual world

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,480
by streaming light through the structure's walls.

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,960
Sunlight was transformed by the stained glass windows into a diffuse red, blue, and gold

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,200
that glimmers on the chapel sculptures and gilded arches.

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,360
To create these stunning displays of light, to house these giant stained glass windows,

44
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,640
they built vast walls by constructing spectacularly high ceilings.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,440
How did these engineers, called masons, know how to carve a cathedral's thousands of building

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,880
blocks to create when assembled not only beauty, but also stability?

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,160
Like all great engineers, they drew on past knowledge.

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,120
They used an architectural element that originated in present-day Pakistan.

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,040
Notice that Saint-Chapelle has, as do all cathedrals, pointed arches, some six on the

50
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,800
front, at least ten on each side, and on the back six more.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,040
And of course, many pointed arches support the ceiling.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,280
They chose this pointed arch over the arch used in the Roman's extraordinary pantheon,

53
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,480
built about 1400 years before Saint-Chapelle.

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,200
The pantheon, typical of all imperial Roman architecture, features a semi-circular arch.

55
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,920
It is exactly half of a circle.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,080
If a medieval engineer used a semi-circular Roman arch to construct a soaring cathedral,

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,360
it would cover entire city blocks and use so much stone that the cost would skyrocket.

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,480
The savings from using a pointed arch instead of a semi-circular arch can be seen clearly

59
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,480
by comparing Saint-Chapelle with the pantheon.

60
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,440
Notice how Saint-Chapelle is nearly the same height as the pantheon, yet just a little

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,760
over a third is wide.

62
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,760
This Roman semi-circular arch was rejected by medieval engineers because its width has

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,640
to grow proportionally to its height.

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,600
To see the problem, consider a semi-circular arch that is 10 meters in width.

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,080
It is 5 meters in height because it's half of a circle.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,120
So its height is half of the diameter.

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,720
Now, if I double the span covered from 10 meters to 20 meters, you see that the height

68
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
is now 10 meters.

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,120
It has doubled.

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,080
Contrast this to the pointed arch.

71
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,680
As the arch increases in height, the span covered can stay the same because the shape

72
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,960
of the arch can change as its height increases.

73
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,000
Although medieval engineers didn't adopt the Roman semi-circular arch, from the Romans

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,720
they inherited the key idea that enabled them to build their stunning cathedrals that have

75
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,520
stood for centuries.

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,880
We can see it in this arch from Saint-Chapelle.

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,720
To support this arch, the medieval engineers had to correctly size the thickness of this

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
wall.

79
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,320
If this wall were too thin, the weight of the arch would buckle the wall, the structure

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
would collapse.

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,280
If too thick, stone would be wasted at a huge cost and the desired open space inside the

82
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,480
cathedral diminished.

83
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,000
To size the wall, the medieval builder used a rule that created the stable semi-circular

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
arches of the pantheon.

85
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,120
A stable arch results when the supporting wall's thickness is between a fourth or a

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,560
fifth of the arch's span.

87
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,120
If an arch's span were this long, then you divide it into about four equal parts and

88
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,320
use one of these to size the wall's thickness.

89
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,880
But there's a problem with applying this proportional rule.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,000
The Mason's knew no mathematics, nor, as I've said, they even have a ruler.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,080
So this rule was not a calculation, but was instead an action.

92
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,040
The Mason would have a life-size chalk drawing of the interior of this arch on the floor

93
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,040
of the drawing room.

94
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,600
Instead, I've drawn the interior of a pointed arch on a large sheet of paper.

95
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,080
In addition to this arch drawing or template, you need a piece of string the Mason would

96
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
have used to rope.

97
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,360
I need to drape it over the arch, so I'll insert map pins along the arch to support

98
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
the string.

99
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,760
The Mason would have done this on the floor, so he would simply lay the rope on top of

100
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,280
his drawing.

101
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,760
Now, drape the rope over the arch, mark the string at the base of the arch, and then

102
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,880
cut the string, so it's only as long as the arch.

103
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,960
Next, lay the string on the ground and fold it into thirds.

104
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,160
I've marked the thirds with pink tape here the Mason would have used colored chalk.

105
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,320
That thirds isn't obvious, but it will get us to a wall thickness of about a fourth or

106
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,000
a fifth.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,400
With the rope now marked into three sections of equal length, return it to its original

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,760
place along the arch template.

109
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,040
We see that this divides the arch into three equal sections.

110
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Let's mark one of them.

111
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Then pin one end of a new string to that marked spot.

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Draw a taut, and pin it to the base of the arch.

113
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,040
We need to attach to the base a length of string exactly equal to the distance from

114
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,040
the spot a third of the way along the arch to the base, so I just fold the rope and mark it.

115
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,040
And then draw that taut in a straight line with the pin section.

116
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Then pin it to the base.

117
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,040
The distance from that pin to the inner line is the width of the wall, which will be between

118
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,040
a fourth and a fifth of the arch's span.

119
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Let's compare it to the arch section from Saint Chapelle.

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
If I superimpose it on the string construction, you can see that it matches.

121
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,040
It's puzzling that we divided the arch into three sections, which yield a width between

122
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,040
a fourth and a fifth, but that's just how the geometry works out.

123
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
That's part of the rule.

124
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
I've never worked out why geometrically that works, because it doesn't matter.

125
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
The Mason would never have worked it out analytically.

126
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
What matters, and that's the point here, is that it works.

127
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,040
And to belabor the point a bit, it's the same rule the Romans used to size their supporting walls.

128
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Divide the interior of a Roman semi-circular arch into three equal size sections,

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,040
draw a line from one of these third markings to the base of the arch, then double it,

130
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,040
and you see the wall size of a bit less than a fourth of the interior arch's span.

131
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
With that rule, we've arrived at the core of the engineering method.

132
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,040
The proportional rule doesn't come from some scientific analysis of stone and its properties.

133
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,040
It comes from centuries of experience, from trial and error.

134
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,040
It's called the rule of thumb, more formally a heuristic.

135
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,040
An imprecise method used as a shortcut to find the solution to a problem,

136
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,040
often by narrowing the range of possible solutions.

137
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Here, a Mason sized the walls width in a matter of minutes,

138
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,040
without understanding the fundamental material properties of stone,

139
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,040
and without understanding the mathematics needed to apply the rule.

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
That's a paradigm for the engineering method.

141
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Solving problems using rules of thumb

142
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,040
that cause the best change in a poorly understood situation using available resources.

143
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
That's a sharp contrast with the scientific method,

144
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,040
because these rules of thumb are only guides that offer a high probability of success, but no guarantee.

145
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,040
And unlike a scientific theory, a rule of thumb is never in a sense disproved.

146
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,040
That hundreds of cathedrals are still around today,

147
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
standing for eight or nine hundred years is proof of that.

148
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Instead of being disproved, this rule of thumb for stone became outdated,

149
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,040
not wrong, as iron and steel I-beams replace stone.

150
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Yet no doubt there's a question in your mind.

151
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I've talked about buildings constructed eight or so centuries ago.

152
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
So surely you might wonder,

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,040
is engineering based on rules of thumb antiquated in our scientific age?

154
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040
That line of thought misunderstands the purpose of the engineering method,

155
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,040
which is to solve practical problems before we have full scientific knowledge.

156
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,040
In the next video, I'll explore how engineers work their way around

157
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,040
that lack of scientific understanding, how they overcome uncertainty.

158
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm Bill Hammack, the Engineer Guy.

159
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Thank you.
