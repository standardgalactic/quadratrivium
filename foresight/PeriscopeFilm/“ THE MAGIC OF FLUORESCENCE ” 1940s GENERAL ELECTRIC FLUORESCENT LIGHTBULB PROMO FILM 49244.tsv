0	25700	Florescence, this, that magic property of various materials to glow mysteriously, weirdly,
25700	31200	and subjected to certain invisible spectral rays.
31200	36880	Such weird and beautiful forms of luminescence in solid materials were first recorded in
36880	44380	history one night almost four centuries ago, when an Italian alchemist Vincenzo Casciarola
44380	51100	discovered some glowing bearite in the hills near his home in Bologna.
51100	57900	It is from a similar phenomenon from fluorescence that a fundamentally different principle of
57900	63880	lighting, a new form of light source, has been developed.
63880	71840	From the beginning of history, man depended upon some form of fire or heat, or light.
71840	78420	Many millions of years ago, when man first carried a flaming spaget into his cave, he
78420	85420	brought light indoors, thus was man's long fight against darkness begun.
85420	90840	The caveman literally held aloft the torch of civilization.
90840	97660	A few million years later, about 4000 BC, the oil lamp was developed.
97660	103180	Its illumination was little it any better than that of the burning spaget.
103180	109140	In many, many more centuries elapsed before the invention of the candle, but its illumination
109140	112780	was no great improvement over that of the pottery lamp.
112780	119300	Not until the 18th century did man devise a means of protection for the flame of his
119300	120800	light.
120800	127900	The lamp chimney was the first scientific example of an accessory to the source of light.
127900	132060	It tripled lighting efficiency.
132060	137980	The first permanent lighting installation was made possible by the piping of gas early
137980	144740	in the last century, but as marvelous as gas light seemed to be, it was still in effect
144740	150620	an open flame and could not be adapted for universal use.
150620	158540	Then in 1879, Thomas Edison devised the first practical incandescent lamp, and in this single
158540	164860	great invention, the basis for more progress was made in lighting than had been made before
164860	167940	in all time.
167940	176180	From Edison's first carbon lamps to the tungsten lamp to the present gas-filled lamp, science
176180	183820	in a very few years developed the incandescent lamp, so efficiently adapted to many varieties
183820	186900	of usage today.
186900	192540	When the great era of modern lamp research had begun, industry's laboratories took over
192540	197180	man's age-old battle to banish darkness.
197180	204460	In these laboratories, researchers made discovery after discovery of new efficiencies and new
204460	210420	comforts of better living through better light at less cost.
210420	216860	Tracing back to Kaskierola's first frightened glimpse of a glowing stone, modern lamp research
216860	219660	solved countless problems.
219660	221860	They tested and discarded.
221860	230980	They tried and erred, but always they progressed until, in 1938, this entirely new kind of
230980	237180	artificial light, fluorescent light, was made available for man's use.
237180	245100	Here, electricity that formerly was wasted in heat is turned into more light, more pleasing
245140	251460	like, more abundant light without increased lighting costs.
251460	259260	And so this companion to the incandescent lamp marks a new great stride forward.
259260	268140	For now, man is no longer merely fighting darkness, he is beginning to move the sun indoors.
268140	274900	The energy available to man comes largely from the sun in the form of energy waves.
274900	281300	The different kinds of energy are spread out in what is called a spectrum.
281300	287700	The position in the spectrum is an indication of the wavelength of the energy.
287700	293140	Most wavelengths cannot be seen by the human eye, they are invisible.
293140	298540	Only the wavelengths shown here in color are visible to man.
298540	304740	And research has discovered that it is precisely at the invisible ultraviolet wavelength
304740	313140	known to science as 2537, where we find the original energy that has made practical the
313140	316500	modern fluorescent lamp.
316500	323380	The fluorescent lamp is an electronic device, so let's move in and see how the electron
323380	332740	is employed to produce the almost magical 2537 energy.
332740	340740	The lamp is composed principally of an electrode which acts alternately as a cathode and an anode
340740	350540	and at each end of the tube an inert gas, argon, to aid in starting a tiny droplet of
350540	359340	mercury and a fluorescent material called a phosphor, coating the entire inside of the
359340	361220	tube.
361220	367860	When the lamp is turned on, the electrical current causes the electrode wire to heat up.
367860	375180	This occurs in a very short time, after which voltage is applied to the ends of the tube.
375180	381860	As the electrode heats up, billions of electrons are violently boiled out.
381860	387460	These little fellows are actually only about two triggens of an inch in size.
387460	391500	They're just little bits of things.
391500	396900	Forced out by the heat and voltage, they leave the electrode with terrific speed, but they
396900	399660	soon tend to slow down.
399660	402900	Behind them come more and more electrons.
402900	408060	If we don't watch out, there's going to be a nasty traffic jam right near the electrode.
408060	415100	But fortunately, these same swiftly moving electrons hitting atoms of argon and mercury
415100	421100	instantly and mysteriously change them so that they act as traffic cops.
421100	427580	These cops help to unsnarl the jam and assist millions of the electrons toward the electrode
427580	432300	at the other end of the tube.
432300	437180	Through this action, an alternating current arc is established.
437180	442980	In the quick starting lamp, this action happens instantaneously.
442980	448300	The arc causes the mercury to vaporize and greatly increase the number of mercury atoms
448300	452020	throughout the tube.
452020	457820	This little mercury atom is going about minding his own business when suddenly a free electron
457820	464580	going at just the right speed collides with him, knocking him for the proverbial loop.
464580	468100	The poor little mercury atom immediately tries to recover.
468100	473820	He tries to stop himself, and in order to get rid of his excess energy, he converts
473820	482220	it mysteriously to radiation, the magic 2537.
482220	487860	When these invisible radiations strike the phosphor coating on the inside of the tube,
487860	491580	they are transformed into visible light.
491580	497740	Most of the materials used in coating the tube are synthetic phosphors not found in
497740	500180	nature.
500180	505260	They were developed through lamp research at Neela Park by exhaustive experiments with
505260	508820	thousands of materials.
508820	515340	And as is so often the case, these synthetic phosphors are far superior to those found
515340	516340	in nature.
516660	523420	In fact, many phosphors used today are not found in nature in that form.
523420	531700	Here, synthetic phosphors are transforming the magical 2537 into very colored, efficient,
531700	535020	economical fluorescent light.
535020	539020	Outwardly, the fluorescent lamp appears to be simple.
539020	545380	At first glance, it seems to be no more than a bit of glass, a bit of metal, from all over
545380	550820	the world come a great materials to be used in this lamp.
550820	561060	Metals and alloys, rare gases, chemicals of various kinds, dolomite, arsenic, throntium,
561060	569980	magnesium, these and many other materials, each with its own special function, are combined
569980	572940	in a single lamp.
572980	580100	The efficiency and quality of this fluorescent lamp requires precision design and precision
580100	583660	manufacturing.
583660	590140	While it is true that fluorescent lamps look much alike, such factors as the ratio of tube
590140	599700	length to diameter, the infinitesimal exactitude of phosphor crystal size, the hair-fine uniformity
599700	608500	of electrode wire, these and a host of other possible combinations must be just right as
608500	616620	determined by thorough lamp research to give the greatest lighting efficiency.
616620	624460	And to keep these combinations exactly right, quality control must be rigidly applied at
624460	628220	every step of manufacture.
628220	635020	In the factories where these lamps are made, even such a little thing as the special ink
635020	641740	used to imprint the designation of size and color is rigidly controlled.
641740	645260	It is mixed from seven different ingredients.
645260	650860	Next, the phosphor coating is applied inside the tube.
650860	657220	Air pressure forces the fluid evenly through the tube.
657220	664420	That's it lady, I thought surely it was going over that time, pretty isn't it?
664420	667580	I mean the liquid in the tubes.
667580	675860	After the coating has been heat dried, it is checked for thickness in a special reflectometer.
675860	683980	The thickness of the coating must be uniform within three one hundred thousands of an inch.
683980	692300	The mount supporting the electrode is an assembly of exhaust tube, glass flare, and lead wires.
692300	695940	There is one mount for each end of the tube.
695940	701540	Mounts two are closely scrutinized for possible minute defects.
701540	706300	The next step is the sealing machine.
706300	713020	Here the mounts meet the coated tube, the mounts are sealed to the ends of the tube.
713020	717340	By melting and fusing the glass together.
717340	726060	One end is completely sealed, air tight, the other is provided with a small exhaust tube
726060	733460	through which air can be drawn to create a vacuum inside the lamp.
733460	739580	The air is exhausted from the lamp by an ingeniously designed exhausting machine.
739580	748300	The lamps move around the circle and air is drawn out as they pass through an oven.
748300	755940	The heat facilitates the removal of the air and a high degree of vacuum is achieved.
755940	761620	Low voltage current is applied to the electrode to provide additional heat and to cause the
761620	766420	coating on the electrode to cast off all impurities.
766860	776580	Next, the machine automatically measures and injects a tiny exact amount of mercury.
776580	783060	And a charge of pure, super-dry ardent gas is put in with just the correct pressure to
783060	789060	assure easy starting and long life for the lamp.
789060	794980	Still in the same machine, the little tube through which the air has been removed is
794980	802380	sealed off and Mr. Electron and his fellow workers are now hermetically isolated from
802380	805260	the outer world.
805260	811460	In the next operation, the lead wires are threaded through the hollow contact pins in
811460	813780	the base.
813780	821220	The base filled with special cement is sealed to the tube by baking at an exactly controlled
821220	824460	temperature.
824460	837620	The extra lengths of lead wires are cut off and the leads are soldered to the pins.
837620	843940	Now you might think that the painstaking job of making a lamp is completed, but no, there
843940	848140	are still a lot of tests and inspections to be made.
848140	854660	On these racks, the lamps are being seasoned, stabilized as it were, before final checkups
854660	856660	are made.
856660	862980	Here the lamp is operated under extremely adverse conditions, conditions rarely encountered
862980	871340	in ordinary use, and all phases of its performance are thoroughly checked.
871340	880580	In all some 480 tests and quality controls are applied before the finished lamp is ready
880580	889060	to be packed and sent on its way to, uh-oh, what's this, taking the lamp out of the carton
889060	892100	again and it hasn't even left the plant.
892100	898660	Oh, that's right, she's a special inspector and she works for an outside concern, one
898660	904780	of the country's leading testing laboratories, and she's giving the lamp another good going
904780	909740	over on a strictly impartial and unbiased basis.
909740	913940	She will test at least one lamp from each carton.
913940	920140	Her reports cover six days different checkups and tests, and she sends them directly to
920140	923020	her boss in New York.
923020	927780	Every day or so, a summary of these reports is given to the manufacturer.
927780	932940	The various groups compete with each other for the best workmanship, alert always for
932940	936780	new means of quality control.
936780	944260	Now all of these tests and inspections and checkups and controls, of course, cost something,
944260	951340	but every dollar invested by the manufacturer to make lamps stay brighter longer returns
951340	961180	to the public many hundred fold by making possible better light at lower cost.
961180	967620	And this idea of light at lower cost applies to fluorescent lighting, even though the original
967620	975820	power source is the same electric current we have used for so many years.
975820	981460	While the price trend of most commodities during recent years has been generally upward,
981460	987980	the cost of lighting due to the improvement in lamps, the reduction in lamp prices, and
987980	993260	the lowered cost of electricity has gone steadily downward.
993260	1001900	Among all the established sciences, the technology of lighting is comparatively young, yet truly
1001900	1008540	remarkable forward strides have been made in this science in very recent years.
1008540	1015620	The quality and versatile usefulness of man-made light have become greater and greater while
1015620	1022100	its cost has become less and less.
1022100	1036860	Thus does the science of lighting bring constant improvement in the comfort, health protection,
1036860	1043900	and livability of our homes, in the beauty and utility of our public buildings, in our
1043900	1053620	stores large and small, and in the efficiency and productiveness of our industry?
1053620	1063500	As man progresses toward the ultimate accomplishment of moving the sun indoors, a great and significant
1063500	1070100	part in this achievement is being played by the magic of fluorescence.
