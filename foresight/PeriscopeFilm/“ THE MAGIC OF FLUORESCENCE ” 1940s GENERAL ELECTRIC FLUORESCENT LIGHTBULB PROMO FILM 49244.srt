1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,700
Florescence, this, that magic property of various materials to glow mysteriously, weirdly,

2
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,200
and subjected to certain invisible spectral rays.

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,880
Such weird and beautiful forms of luminescence in solid materials were first recorded in

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,380
history one night almost four centuries ago, when an Italian alchemist Vincenzo Casciarola

5
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:51,100
discovered some glowing bearite in the hills near his home in Bologna.

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,900
It is from a similar phenomenon from fluorescence that a fundamentally different principle of

7
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,880
lighting, a new form of light source, has been developed.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:11,840
From the beginning of history, man depended upon some form of fire or heat, or light.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,420
Many millions of years ago, when man first carried a flaming spaget into his cave, he

10
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,420
brought light indoors, thus was man's long fight against darkness begun.

11
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,840
The caveman literally held aloft the torch of civilization.

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,660
A few million years later, about 4000 BC, the oil lamp was developed.

13
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,180
Its illumination was little it any better than that of the burning spaget.

14
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,140
In many, many more centuries elapsed before the invention of the candle, but its illumination

15
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,780
was no great improvement over that of the pottery lamp.

16
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,300
Not until the 18th century did man devise a means of protection for the flame of his

17
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,800
light.

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,900
The lamp chimney was the first scientific example of an accessory to the source of light.

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,060
It tripled lighting efficiency.

20
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,980
The first permanent lighting installation was made possible by the piping of gas early

21
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,740
in the last century, but as marvelous as gas light seemed to be, it was still in effect

22
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,620
an open flame and could not be adapted for universal use.

23
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,540
Then in 1879, Thomas Edison devised the first practical incandescent lamp, and in this single

24
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,860
great invention, the basis for more progress was made in lighting than had been made before

25
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,940
in all time.

26
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:56,180
From Edison's first carbon lamps to the tungsten lamp to the present gas-filled lamp, science

27
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:03,820
in a very few years developed the incandescent lamp, so efficiently adapted to many varieties

28
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,900
of usage today.

29
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,540
When the great era of modern lamp research had begun, industry's laboratories took over

30
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,180
man's age-old battle to banish darkness.

31
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,460
In these laboratories, researchers made discovery after discovery of new efficiencies and new

32
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,420
comforts of better living through better light at less cost.

33
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,860
Tracing back to Kaskierola's first frightened glimpse of a glowing stone, modern lamp research

34
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,660
solved countless problems.

35
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,860
They tested and discarded.

36
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:50,980
They tried and erred, but always they progressed until, in 1938, this entirely new kind of

37
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,180
artificial light, fluorescent light, was made available for man's use.

38
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,100
Here, electricity that formerly was wasted in heat is turned into more light, more pleasing

39
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,460
like, more abundant light without increased lighting costs.

40
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:19,260
And so this companion to the incandescent lamp marks a new great stride forward.

41
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:28,140
For now, man is no longer merely fighting darkness, he is beginning to move the sun indoors.

42
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,900
The energy available to man comes largely from the sun in the form of energy waves.

43
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,300
The different kinds of energy are spread out in what is called a spectrum.

44
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,700
The position in the spectrum is an indication of the wavelength of the energy.

45
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,140
Most wavelengths cannot be seen by the human eye, they are invisible.

46
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,540
Only the wavelengths shown here in color are visible to man.

47
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,740
And research has discovered that it is precisely at the invisible ultraviolet wavelength

48
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:13,140
known to science as 2537, where we find the original energy that has made practical the

49
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,500
modern fluorescent lamp.

50
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,380
The fluorescent lamp is an electronic device, so let's move in and see how the electron

51
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:32,740
is employed to produce the almost magical 2537 energy.

52
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:40,740
The lamp is composed principally of an electrode which acts alternately as a cathode and an anode

53
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:50,540
and at each end of the tube an inert gas, argon, to aid in starting a tiny droplet of

54
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:59,340
mercury and a fluorescent material called a phosphor, coating the entire inside of the

55
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,220
tube.

56
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,860
When the lamp is turned on, the electrical current causes the electrode wire to heat up.

57
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:15,180
This occurs in a very short time, after which voltage is applied to the ends of the tube.

58
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,860
As the electrode heats up, billions of electrons are violently boiled out.

59
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,460
These little fellows are actually only about two triggens of an inch in size.

60
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,500
They're just little bits of things.

61
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,900
Forced out by the heat and voltage, they leave the electrode with terrific speed, but they

62
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,660
soon tend to slow down.

63
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,900
Behind them come more and more electrons.

64
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,060
If we don't watch out, there's going to be a nasty traffic jam right near the electrode.

65
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,100
But fortunately, these same swiftly moving electrons hitting atoms of argon and mercury

66
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,100
instantly and mysteriously change them so that they act as traffic cops.

67
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,580
These cops help to unsnarl the jam and assist millions of the electrons toward the electrode

68
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,300
at the other end of the tube.

69
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,180
Through this action, an alternating current arc is established.

70
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,980
In the quick starting lamp, this action happens instantaneously.

71
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,300
The arc causes the mercury to vaporize and greatly increase the number of mercury atoms

72
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,020
throughout the tube.

73
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,820
This little mercury atom is going about minding his own business when suddenly a free electron

74
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,580
going at just the right speed collides with him, knocking him for the proverbial loop.

75
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,100
The poor little mercury atom immediately tries to recover.

76
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,820
He tries to stop himself, and in order to get rid of his excess energy, he converts

77
00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:02,220
it mysteriously to radiation, the magic 2537.

78
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,860
When these invisible radiations strike the phosphor coating on the inside of the tube,

79
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,580
they are transformed into visible light.

80
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,740
Most of the materials used in coating the tube are synthetic phosphors not found in

81
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,180
nature.

82
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,260
They were developed through lamp research at Neela Park by exhaustive experiments with

83
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,820
thousands of materials.

84
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,340
And as is so often the case, these synthetic phosphors are far superior to those found

85
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
in nature.

86
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:43,420
In fact, many phosphors used today are not found in nature in that form.

87
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:51,700
Here, synthetic phosphors are transforming the magical 2537 into very colored, efficient,

88
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,020
economical fluorescent light.

89
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,020
Outwardly, the fluorescent lamp appears to be simple.

90
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:05,380
At first glance, it seems to be no more than a bit of glass, a bit of metal, from all over

91
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,820
the world come a great materials to be used in this lamp.

92
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:21,060
Metals and alloys, rare gases, chemicals of various kinds, dolomite, arsenic, throntium,

93
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:29,980
magnesium, these and many other materials, each with its own special function, are combined

94
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,940
in a single lamp.

95
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:40,100
The efficiency and quality of this fluorescent lamp requires precision design and precision

96
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,660
manufacturing.

97
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:50,140
While it is true that fluorescent lamps look much alike, such factors as the ratio of tube

98
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:59,700
length to diameter, the infinitesimal exactitude of phosphor crystal size, the hair-fine uniformity

99
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:08,500
of electrode wire, these and a host of other possible combinations must be just right as

100
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:16,620
determined by thorough lamp research to give the greatest lighting efficiency.

101
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:24,460
And to keep these combinations exactly right, quality control must be rigidly applied at

102
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,220
every step of manufacture.

103
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:35,020
In the factories where these lamps are made, even such a little thing as the special ink

104
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:41,740
used to imprint the designation of size and color is rigidly controlled.

105
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,260
It is mixed from seven different ingredients.

106
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,860
Next, the phosphor coating is applied inside the tube.

107
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,220
Air pressure forces the fluid evenly through the tube.

108
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,420
That's it lady, I thought surely it was going over that time, pretty isn't it?

109
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,580
I mean the liquid in the tubes.

110
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:15,860
After the coating has been heat dried, it is checked for thickness in a special reflectometer.

111
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,980
The thickness of the coating must be uniform within three one hundred thousands of an inch.

112
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:32,300
The mount supporting the electrode is an assembly of exhaust tube, glass flare, and lead wires.

113
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,940
There is one mount for each end of the tube.

114
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,540
Mounts two are closely scrutinized for possible minute defects.

115
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,300
The next step is the sealing machine.

116
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:53,020
Here the mounts meet the coated tube, the mounts are sealed to the ends of the tube.

117
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,340
By melting and fusing the glass together.

118
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:06,060
One end is completely sealed, air tight, the other is provided with a small exhaust tube

119
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:13,460
through which air can be drawn to create a vacuum inside the lamp.

120
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,580
The air is exhausted from the lamp by an ingeniously designed exhausting machine.

121
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:28,300
The lamps move around the circle and air is drawn out as they pass through an oven.

122
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:35,940
The heat facilitates the removal of the air and a high degree of vacuum is achieved.

123
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,620
Low voltage current is applied to the electrode to provide additional heat and to cause the

124
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,420
coating on the electrode to cast off all impurities.

125
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:56,580
Next, the machine automatically measures and injects a tiny exact amount of mercury.

126
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,060
And a charge of pure, super-dry ardent gas is put in with just the correct pressure to

127
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,060
assure easy starting and long life for the lamp.

128
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,980
Still in the same machine, the little tube through which the air has been removed is

129
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:22,380
sealed off and Mr. Electron and his fellow workers are now hermetically isolated from

130
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,260
the outer world.

131
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,460
In the next operation, the lead wires are threaded through the hollow contact pins in

132
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,780
the base.

133
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:41,220
The base filled with special cement is sealed to the tube by baking at an exactly controlled

134
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,460
temperature.

135
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:57,620
The extra lengths of lead wires are cut off and the leads are soldered to the pins.

136
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,940
Now you might think that the painstaking job of making a lamp is completed, but no, there

137
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,140
are still a lot of tests and inspections to be made.

138
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,660
On these racks, the lamps are being seasoned, stabilized as it were, before final checkups

139
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
are made.

140
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,980
Here the lamp is operated under extremely adverse conditions, conditions rarely encountered

141
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:31,340
in ordinary use, and all phases of its performance are thoroughly checked.

142
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:40,580
In all some 480 tests and quality controls are applied before the finished lamp is ready

143
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:49,060
to be packed and sent on its way to, uh-oh, what's this, taking the lamp out of the carton

144
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,100
again and it hasn't even left the plant.

145
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,660
Oh, that's right, she's a special inspector and she works for an outside concern, one

146
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,780
of the country's leading testing laboratories, and she's giving the lamp another good going

147
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,740
over on a strictly impartial and unbiased basis.

148
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,940
She will test at least one lamp from each carton.

149
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,140
Her reports cover six days different checkups and tests, and she sends them directly to

150
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,020
her boss in New York.

151
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,780
Every day or so, a summary of these reports is given to the manufacturer.

152
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,940
The various groups compete with each other for the best workmanship, alert always for

153
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,780
new means of quality control.

154
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:44,260
Now all of these tests and inspections and checkups and controls, of course, cost something,

155
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:51,340
but every dollar invested by the manufacturer to make lamps stay brighter longer returns

156
00:15:51,340 --> 00:16:01,180
to the public many hundred fold by making possible better light at lower cost.

157
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,620
And this idea of light at lower cost applies to fluorescent lighting, even though the original

158
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:15,820
power source is the same electric current we have used for so many years.

159
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,460
While the price trend of most commodities during recent years has been generally upward,

160
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,980
the cost of lighting due to the improvement in lamps, the reduction in lamp prices, and

161
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,260
the lowered cost of electricity has gone steadily downward.

162
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:41,900
Among all the established sciences, the technology of lighting is comparatively young, yet truly

163
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:48,540
remarkable forward strides have been made in this science in very recent years.

164
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:55,620
The quality and versatile usefulness of man-made light have become greater and greater while

165
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:02,100
its cost has become less and less.

166
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:16,860
Thus does the science of lighting bring constant improvement in the comfort, health protection,

167
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,900
and livability of our homes, in the beauty and utility of our public buildings, in our

168
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:33,620
stores large and small, and in the efficiency and productiveness of our industry?

169
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:43,500
As man progresses toward the ultimate accomplishment of moving the sun indoors, a great and significant

170
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,100
part in this achievement is being played by the magic of fluorescence.
