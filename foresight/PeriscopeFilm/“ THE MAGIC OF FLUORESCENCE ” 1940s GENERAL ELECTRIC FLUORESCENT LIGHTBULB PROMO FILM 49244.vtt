00:00.000 --> 00:25.700
Florescence, this, that magic property of various materials to glow mysteriously, weirdly,

00:25.700 --> 00:31.200
and subjected to certain invisible spectral rays.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.880
Such weird and beautiful forms of luminescence in solid materials were first recorded in

00:36.880 --> 00:44.380
history one night almost four centuries ago, when an Italian alchemist Vincenzo Casciarola

00:44.380 --> 00:51.100
discovered some glowing bearite in the hills near his home in Bologna.

00:51.100 --> 00:57.900
It is from a similar phenomenon from fluorescence that a fundamentally different principle of

00:57.900 --> 01:03.880
lighting, a new form of light source, has been developed.

01:03.880 --> 01:11.840
From the beginning of history, man depended upon some form of fire or heat, or light.

01:11.840 --> 01:18.420
Many millions of years ago, when man first carried a flaming spaget into his cave, he

01:18.420 --> 01:25.420
brought light indoors, thus was man's long fight against darkness begun.

01:25.420 --> 01:30.840
The caveman literally held aloft the torch of civilization.

01:30.840 --> 01:37.660
A few million years later, about 4000 BC, the oil lamp was developed.

01:37.660 --> 01:43.180
Its illumination was little it any better than that of the burning spaget.

01:43.180 --> 01:49.140
In many, many more centuries elapsed before the invention of the candle, but its illumination

01:49.140 --> 01:52.780
was no great improvement over that of the pottery lamp.

01:52.780 --> 01:59.300
Not until the 18th century did man devise a means of protection for the flame of his

01:59.300 --> 02:00.800
light.

02:00.800 --> 02:07.900
The lamp chimney was the first scientific example of an accessory to the source of light.

02:07.900 --> 02:12.060
It tripled lighting efficiency.

02:12.060 --> 02:17.980
The first permanent lighting installation was made possible by the piping of gas early

02:17.980 --> 02:24.740
in the last century, but as marvelous as gas light seemed to be, it was still in effect

02:24.740 --> 02:30.620
an open flame and could not be adapted for universal use.

02:30.620 --> 02:38.540
Then in 1879, Thomas Edison devised the first practical incandescent lamp, and in this single

02:38.540 --> 02:44.860
great invention, the basis for more progress was made in lighting than had been made before

02:44.860 --> 02:47.940
in all time.

02:47.940 --> 02:56.180
From Edison's first carbon lamps to the tungsten lamp to the present gas-filled lamp, science

02:56.180 --> 03:03.820
in a very few years developed the incandescent lamp, so efficiently adapted to many varieties

03:03.820 --> 03:06.900
of usage today.

03:06.900 --> 03:12.540
When the great era of modern lamp research had begun, industry's laboratories took over

03:12.540 --> 03:17.180
man's age-old battle to banish darkness.

03:17.180 --> 03:24.460
In these laboratories, researchers made discovery after discovery of new efficiencies and new

03:24.460 --> 03:30.420
comforts of better living through better light at less cost.

03:30.420 --> 03:36.860
Tracing back to Kaskierola's first frightened glimpse of a glowing stone, modern lamp research

03:36.860 --> 03:39.660
solved countless problems.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.860
They tested and discarded.

03:41.860 --> 03:50.980
They tried and erred, but always they progressed until, in 1938, this entirely new kind of

03:50.980 --> 03:57.180
artificial light, fluorescent light, was made available for man's use.

03:57.180 --> 04:05.100
Here, electricity that formerly was wasted in heat is turned into more light, more pleasing

04:05.140 --> 04:11.460
like, more abundant light without increased lighting costs.

04:11.460 --> 04:19.260
And so this companion to the incandescent lamp marks a new great stride forward.

04:19.260 --> 04:28.140
For now, man is no longer merely fighting darkness, he is beginning to move the sun indoors.

04:28.140 --> 04:34.900
The energy available to man comes largely from the sun in the form of energy waves.

04:34.900 --> 04:41.300
The different kinds of energy are spread out in what is called a spectrum.

04:41.300 --> 04:47.700
The position in the spectrum is an indication of the wavelength of the energy.

04:47.700 --> 04:53.140
Most wavelengths cannot be seen by the human eye, they are invisible.

04:53.140 --> 04:58.540
Only the wavelengths shown here in color are visible to man.

04:58.540 --> 05:04.740
And research has discovered that it is precisely at the invisible ultraviolet wavelength

05:04.740 --> 05:13.140
known to science as 2537, where we find the original energy that has made practical the

05:13.140 --> 05:16.500
modern fluorescent lamp.

05:16.500 --> 05:23.380
The fluorescent lamp is an electronic device, so let's move in and see how the electron

05:23.380 --> 05:32.740
is employed to produce the almost magical 2537 energy.

05:32.740 --> 05:40.740
The lamp is composed principally of an electrode which acts alternately as a cathode and an anode

05:40.740 --> 05:50.540
and at each end of the tube an inert gas, argon, to aid in starting a tiny droplet of

05:50.540 --> 05:59.340
mercury and a fluorescent material called a phosphor, coating the entire inside of the

05:59.340 --> 06:01.220
tube.

06:01.220 --> 06:07.860
When the lamp is turned on, the electrical current causes the electrode wire to heat up.

06:07.860 --> 06:15.180
This occurs in a very short time, after which voltage is applied to the ends of the tube.

06:15.180 --> 06:21.860
As the electrode heats up, billions of electrons are violently boiled out.

06:21.860 --> 06:27.460
These little fellows are actually only about two triggens of an inch in size.

06:27.460 --> 06:31.500
They're just little bits of things.

06:31.500 --> 06:36.900
Forced out by the heat and voltage, they leave the electrode with terrific speed, but they

06:36.900 --> 06:39.660
soon tend to slow down.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.900
Behind them come more and more electrons.

06:42.900 --> 06:48.060
If we don't watch out, there's going to be a nasty traffic jam right near the electrode.

06:48.060 --> 06:55.100
But fortunately, these same swiftly moving electrons hitting atoms of argon and mercury

06:55.100 --> 07:01.100
instantly and mysteriously change them so that they act as traffic cops.

07:01.100 --> 07:07.580
These cops help to unsnarl the jam and assist millions of the electrons toward the electrode

07:07.580 --> 07:12.300
at the other end of the tube.

07:12.300 --> 07:17.180
Through this action, an alternating current arc is established.

07:17.180 --> 07:22.980
In the quick starting lamp, this action happens instantaneously.

07:22.980 --> 07:28.300
The arc causes the mercury to vaporize and greatly increase the number of mercury atoms

07:28.300 --> 07:32.020
throughout the tube.

07:32.020 --> 07:37.820
This little mercury atom is going about minding his own business when suddenly a free electron

07:37.820 --> 07:44.580
going at just the right speed collides with him, knocking him for the proverbial loop.

07:44.580 --> 07:48.100
The poor little mercury atom immediately tries to recover.

07:48.100 --> 07:53.820
He tries to stop himself, and in order to get rid of his excess energy, he converts

07:53.820 --> 08:02.220
it mysteriously to radiation, the magic 2537.

08:02.220 --> 08:07.860
When these invisible radiations strike the phosphor coating on the inside of the tube,

08:07.860 --> 08:11.580
they are transformed into visible light.

08:11.580 --> 08:17.740
Most of the materials used in coating the tube are synthetic phosphors not found in

08:17.740 --> 08:20.180
nature.

08:20.180 --> 08:25.260
They were developed through lamp research at Neela Park by exhaustive experiments with

08:25.260 --> 08:28.820
thousands of materials.

08:28.820 --> 08:35.340
And as is so often the case, these synthetic phosphors are far superior to those found

08:35.340 --> 08:36.340
in nature.

08:36.660 --> 08:43.420
In fact, many phosphors used today are not found in nature in that form.

08:43.420 --> 08:51.700
Here, synthetic phosphors are transforming the magical 2537 into very colored, efficient,

08:51.700 --> 08:55.020
economical fluorescent light.

08:55.020 --> 08:59.020
Outwardly, the fluorescent lamp appears to be simple.

08:59.020 --> 09:05.380
At first glance, it seems to be no more than a bit of glass, a bit of metal, from all over

09:05.380 --> 09:10.820
the world come a great materials to be used in this lamp.

09:10.820 --> 09:21.060
Metals and alloys, rare gases, chemicals of various kinds, dolomite, arsenic, throntium,

09:21.060 --> 09:29.980
magnesium, these and many other materials, each with its own special function, are combined

09:29.980 --> 09:32.940
in a single lamp.

09:32.980 --> 09:40.100
The efficiency and quality of this fluorescent lamp requires precision design and precision

09:40.100 --> 09:43.660
manufacturing.

09:43.660 --> 09:50.140
While it is true that fluorescent lamps look much alike, such factors as the ratio of tube

09:50.140 --> 09:59.700
length to diameter, the infinitesimal exactitude of phosphor crystal size, the hair-fine uniformity

09:59.700 --> 10:08.500
of electrode wire, these and a host of other possible combinations must be just right as

10:08.500 --> 10:16.620
determined by thorough lamp research to give the greatest lighting efficiency.

10:16.620 --> 10:24.460
And to keep these combinations exactly right, quality control must be rigidly applied at

10:24.460 --> 10:28.220
every step of manufacture.

10:28.220 --> 10:35.020
In the factories where these lamps are made, even such a little thing as the special ink

10:35.020 --> 10:41.740
used to imprint the designation of size and color is rigidly controlled.

10:41.740 --> 10:45.260
It is mixed from seven different ingredients.

10:45.260 --> 10:50.860
Next, the phosphor coating is applied inside the tube.

10:50.860 --> 10:57.220
Air pressure forces the fluid evenly through the tube.

10:57.220 --> 11:04.420
That's it lady, I thought surely it was going over that time, pretty isn't it?

11:04.420 --> 11:07.580
I mean the liquid in the tubes.

11:07.580 --> 11:15.860
After the coating has been heat dried, it is checked for thickness in a special reflectometer.

11:15.860 --> 11:23.980
The thickness of the coating must be uniform within three one hundred thousands of an inch.

11:23.980 --> 11:32.300
The mount supporting the electrode is an assembly of exhaust tube, glass flare, and lead wires.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.940
There is one mount for each end of the tube.

11:35.940 --> 11:41.540
Mounts two are closely scrutinized for possible minute defects.

11:41.540 --> 11:46.300
The next step is the sealing machine.

11:46.300 --> 11:53.020
Here the mounts meet the coated tube, the mounts are sealed to the ends of the tube.

11:53.020 --> 11:57.340
By melting and fusing the glass together.

11:57.340 --> 12:06.060
One end is completely sealed, air tight, the other is provided with a small exhaust tube

12:06.060 --> 12:13.460
through which air can be drawn to create a vacuum inside the lamp.

12:13.460 --> 12:19.580
The air is exhausted from the lamp by an ingeniously designed exhausting machine.

12:19.580 --> 12:28.300
The lamps move around the circle and air is drawn out as they pass through an oven.

12:28.300 --> 12:35.940
The heat facilitates the removal of the air and a high degree of vacuum is achieved.

12:35.940 --> 12:41.620
Low voltage current is applied to the electrode to provide additional heat and to cause the

12:41.620 --> 12:46.420
coating on the electrode to cast off all impurities.

12:46.860 --> 12:56.580
Next, the machine automatically measures and injects a tiny exact amount of mercury.

12:56.580 --> 13:03.060
And a charge of pure, super-dry ardent gas is put in with just the correct pressure to

13:03.060 --> 13:09.060
assure easy starting and long life for the lamp.

13:09.060 --> 13:14.980
Still in the same machine, the little tube through which the air has been removed is

13:14.980 --> 13:22.380
sealed off and Mr. Electron and his fellow workers are now hermetically isolated from

13:22.380 --> 13:25.260
the outer world.

13:25.260 --> 13:31.460
In the next operation, the lead wires are threaded through the hollow contact pins in

13:31.460 --> 13:33.780
the base.

13:33.780 --> 13:41.220
The base filled with special cement is sealed to the tube by baking at an exactly controlled

13:41.220 --> 13:44.460
temperature.

13:44.460 --> 13:57.620
The extra lengths of lead wires are cut off and the leads are soldered to the pins.

13:57.620 --> 14:03.940
Now you might think that the painstaking job of making a lamp is completed, but no, there

14:03.940 --> 14:08.140
are still a lot of tests and inspections to be made.

14:08.140 --> 14:14.660
On these racks, the lamps are being seasoned, stabilized as it were, before final checkups

14:14.660 --> 14:16.660
are made.

14:16.660 --> 14:22.980
Here the lamp is operated under extremely adverse conditions, conditions rarely encountered

14:22.980 --> 14:31.340
in ordinary use, and all phases of its performance are thoroughly checked.

14:31.340 --> 14:40.580
In all some 480 tests and quality controls are applied before the finished lamp is ready

14:40.580 --> 14:49.060
to be packed and sent on its way to, uh-oh, what's this, taking the lamp out of the carton

14:49.060 --> 14:52.100
again and it hasn't even left the plant.

14:52.100 --> 14:58.660
Oh, that's right, she's a special inspector and she works for an outside concern, one

14:58.660 --> 15:04.780
of the country's leading testing laboratories, and she's giving the lamp another good going

15:04.780 --> 15:09.740
over on a strictly impartial and unbiased basis.

15:09.740 --> 15:13.940
She will test at least one lamp from each carton.

15:13.940 --> 15:20.140
Her reports cover six days different checkups and tests, and she sends them directly to

15:20.140 --> 15:23.020
her boss in New York.

15:23.020 --> 15:27.780
Every day or so, a summary of these reports is given to the manufacturer.

15:27.780 --> 15:32.940
The various groups compete with each other for the best workmanship, alert always for

15:32.940 --> 15:36.780
new means of quality control.

15:36.780 --> 15:44.260
Now all of these tests and inspections and checkups and controls, of course, cost something,

15:44.260 --> 15:51.340
but every dollar invested by the manufacturer to make lamps stay brighter longer returns

15:51.340 --> 16:01.180
to the public many hundred fold by making possible better light at lower cost.

16:01.180 --> 16:07.620
And this idea of light at lower cost applies to fluorescent lighting, even though the original

16:07.620 --> 16:15.820
power source is the same electric current we have used for so many years.

16:15.820 --> 16:21.460
While the price trend of most commodities during recent years has been generally upward,

16:21.460 --> 16:27.980
the cost of lighting due to the improvement in lamps, the reduction in lamp prices, and

16:27.980 --> 16:33.260
the lowered cost of electricity has gone steadily downward.

16:33.260 --> 16:41.900
Among all the established sciences, the technology of lighting is comparatively young, yet truly

16:41.900 --> 16:48.540
remarkable forward strides have been made in this science in very recent years.

16:48.540 --> 16:55.620
The quality and versatile usefulness of man-made light have become greater and greater while

16:55.620 --> 17:02.100
its cost has become less and less.

17:02.100 --> 17:16.860
Thus does the science of lighting bring constant improvement in the comfort, health protection,

17:16.860 --> 17:23.900
and livability of our homes, in the beauty and utility of our public buildings, in our

17:23.900 --> 17:33.620
stores large and small, and in the efficiency and productiveness of our industry?

17:33.620 --> 17:43.500
As man progresses toward the ultimate accomplishment of moving the sun indoors, a great and significant

17:43.500 --> 17:50.100
part in this achievement is being played by the magic of fluorescence.
