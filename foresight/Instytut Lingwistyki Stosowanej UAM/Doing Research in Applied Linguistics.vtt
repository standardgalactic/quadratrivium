00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Final presentation of mine. I thought that after talking to you about specific research

00:12.000 --> 00:21.440
topics that I've been interested in, that it might be interesting to talk about a more

00:21.440 --> 00:27.200
general topic which is doing research in applied linguistics. And of course it's my personal

00:27.280 --> 00:34.240
view because anyone who does research in applied linguistics at whatever level, whether that is

00:34.240 --> 00:44.640
your BA research project or your MA dissertation or your PhD or any project beyond the PhD,

00:45.360 --> 00:55.520
everybody is facing similar issues and of course the expectations change slightly as you progress

00:55.600 --> 01:07.520
through your career. I would start by talk about some, I would say almost philosophical issues

01:07.520 --> 01:18.640
about research and one of the things that always struck me was that students tend to have,

01:19.520 --> 01:30.560
tend to believe in predeterminism. They see these libraries full of books and these journals full

01:30.560 --> 01:39.440
of papers and they can see the publication lists of certain researchers and it's easy to think

01:39.440 --> 01:52.800
that this was destined to happen and so that it was driven by God, faith or some unknown force

01:53.920 --> 02:04.880
so they tend to underestimate the fact that in fact nothing is predetermined. If you're a researcher

02:04.880 --> 02:11.840
you could go in a thousand different directions, you could ask a thousand different questions and

02:11.840 --> 02:20.080
you have a choice between a huge amount of methods and so nothing of what actually is produced

02:20.720 --> 02:28.960
is predetermined. It's the result of free choice, free spirits trying to do something

02:28.960 --> 02:36.880
that they are interested in and so I would say that it's crucial to hence realize that

02:37.760 --> 02:45.360
Lambert, Garner, Dornier to mention three of the biggest names in motivation research and second

02:45.360 --> 02:52.800
language acquisition that they weren't destined to introduce motivation and I had a chat with

02:52.800 --> 03:01.040
Garner and Dornier and they were kind of surprised to a certain degree by the fact that their papers

03:01.040 --> 03:08.320
seemed to have so much impact. They hadn't necessarily anticipated it. They were also

03:08.320 --> 03:14.880
interested in other things but it was motivation that made their name and so I quite like the little

03:15.440 --> 03:24.240
picture there about the PhD. If you're standing at the door deciding what to do for your PhD

03:24.240 --> 03:30.800
it may look like a maze and I totally agree and I think that in fact the first year of doing the

03:30.800 --> 03:39.360
PhD is getting lost in the maze and getting a sense of just how big the maze is and wander around

03:39.360 --> 03:48.480
without necessarily finding the exit straight away. So this research does not descend from heaven

03:49.120 --> 03:56.960
that's really an absolutely crucial point so it's not like Moses coming down the mountain

03:56.960 --> 04:03.760
with God's words. It's really the result of inspiration, hard work, sweat and resilience.

04:04.560 --> 04:12.160
Resilience because things typically don't go right straight away and in fact any paper that

04:12.160 --> 04:19.520
you see published in a journal typically has been rejected one or twice, has been rewritten

04:19.520 --> 04:30.880
about 10 or 15 times and the amount of work that the authors put into it is hard to imagine when

04:30.880 --> 04:39.600
you see a nice neat little text that looks like a perfect finished product. Also it's important

04:39.600 --> 04:47.280
to realize that the peer review system is valuable meaning that not all good papers submitted to

04:47.280 --> 04:56.480
journals will get to publication because reviewers or editors may think it's not a good fit with the

04:56.480 --> 05:05.200
journal or the reviewers may not like this type of research or reviewers may have different opinions

05:05.200 --> 05:13.120
about what is important and what is original. So it's important to realize that if you submit

05:13.120 --> 05:21.680
something to a journal and it's rejected never take it personally. It doesn't mean that you are

05:21.680 --> 05:29.360
therefore a bad researcher. Absolutely not. You have to develop resilience and you have to extract

05:30.960 --> 05:39.600
useful information from the rejection letter. What is it that they didn't like? Why? Can you

05:39.600 --> 05:47.040
address it? If you can't address it you know sometimes it's better to throw away a paper that

05:47.040 --> 05:55.760
has some fundamental deficit. If you can adapt it and submit it somewhere else please do and sometimes

05:55.760 --> 06:04.640
good papers can get rejected because they challenge orthodoxy. So I remember talking to

06:04.800 --> 06:18.080
prominent researchers who Albert Costa, the late Catalan psycholinguist who was complaining that

06:18.080 --> 06:25.840
journal editors want in fact more of the same with small variations. So you add one little

06:25.840 --> 06:31.920
ingredient and you repeat what you have done before because they know that that's a product

06:32.880 --> 06:44.800
that will sell, that will be appreciated and he was angry that journals rejected the new papers he

06:44.800 --> 06:52.400
was writing on the foreign language effect and that they wanted more of the old stuff. So I guess

06:52.400 --> 07:00.880
that researchers sometimes face the kind of issue that artists have or singers in that the public

07:00.960 --> 07:10.480
wants the good old tunes, the big hits and they don't necessarily want to hear the

07:11.840 --> 07:21.520
singers' latest creations. Of course if I say that papers don't descend from heaven it doesn't mean

07:22.400 --> 07:32.480
that new theories appear out of nothing. So if you work on certain topics it's because other

07:32.480 --> 07:40.160
people have preceded you in working on that topic that teachers have told you about a certain topic

07:40.160 --> 07:46.720
or certain research questions so the ground was prepared and at that point you come in and you

07:46.720 --> 07:53.920
think okay what could I do to turn this into something original? Could I ask a question that

07:53.920 --> 08:02.160
hasn't been asked before and sometimes you do manage to do that and you end up reshaping the

08:02.160 --> 08:10.400
trajectory of a discipline. Now this is a nice little conceptualization of doing research where

08:10.400 --> 08:18.800
you collect data, you sort it, you arrange it, you present it visually and you explain it with

08:18.800 --> 08:30.880
a story and I would say that the crucial final step really is the explaining with a story meaning

08:30.880 --> 08:38.640
that I desk reject quite a lot of papers submitted to my Journal of Multilingual Multicultural

08:38.640 --> 08:45.920
Development because the authors have been through the first four stages so they did collect data,

08:45.920 --> 08:54.880
they sorted it, they arranged it and they did some visual representation however they did not

08:54.880 --> 09:03.440
come up with a good story and any research paper, any dissertation, any project really,

09:03.680 --> 09:13.600
if there is no good story then in fact it's a failure because what the reader is interested in

09:13.600 --> 09:21.040
or the audience is interested in is a good story that is based on solid data that has

09:21.040 --> 09:26.640
been properly sorted that has been arranged following the conventions of the discipline

09:26.720 --> 09:35.440
and that have been presented visually in order to understand or make a point and then this needs to

09:35.440 --> 09:42.640
be embedded in a good story and the thing is it doesn't really matter what the story is about

09:43.200 --> 09:54.000
but it needs to be a good story. Now if you are an academic or you are a PhD researcher

09:54.640 --> 10:04.160
you may have heard about the sentence you know publish or perish and so this is a nice book by

10:04.160 --> 10:11.840
James Hines, it's a funny book really about a young academic, a young American academic

10:11.840 --> 10:21.200
who faces that terrible pressure to publish in order not to perish and so I think this is an

10:21.280 --> 10:27.680
important point because once you enter academia and you become a researcher you do realise that

10:27.680 --> 10:35.680
there is a huge amount of pressure on you to do so many things, you have to you know first you

10:35.680 --> 10:41.280
finish your PhD and then you have to do so much teaching and you have to do administration and

10:41.280 --> 10:46.720
you're expected to come up with creative ideas and publish them in the best journals and then

10:46.720 --> 10:51.600
you spend so much time writing these papers and then they get rejected and then you realise

10:51.600 --> 10:56.800
and then you hear from your head of department that if you don't have five publications by

10:56.800 --> 11:02.560
the end of the year we will not prolong your contract so you are under a considerable amount

11:02.560 --> 11:09.440
of stress and too much stress risks killing creativity because you end up not sleeping

11:09.440 --> 11:17.840
enough and not going for walks and not allow your brain to engage in the kind of deep thinking that

11:17.840 --> 11:23.440
you can get when I don't know you go walking in the forest and you're looking at a lake and that's

11:23.440 --> 11:30.480
where an idea might hit you so you need to create the conditions where you can be creative

11:31.600 --> 11:37.360
and of course publications matter, the career really depends on the publication list

11:38.160 --> 11:51.680
so when I was in selection committees at Bergbeck the threshold to be invited to an interview

11:51.680 --> 11:58.960
for a lectureship would typically be about five papers and maybe a couple of book reviews

11:59.360 --> 12:12.240
that would be the kind of standard entry to get invited and you need these few publications to

12:13.600 --> 12:19.760
convince the potential employer that you have research potential. I also think that it's better

12:19.760 --> 12:25.760
to have something than nothing so it means that at the very start of your career it's okay if you

12:25.760 --> 12:37.120
have some publications in conference proceedings that's fine I always recommend it to my students

12:37.120 --> 12:43.680
also to write some book reviews because that's a useful way to find your academic voice and have a

12:44.480 --> 12:54.480
line on your CV avoid publishing crap meaning if you realize that what you have produced

12:54.480 --> 12:59.680
isn't very good and you get advice from your supervisor telling you you know that that's not

12:59.680 --> 13:09.360
really good material then avoid publishing it so I guess that as if you want to become a researcher

13:09.360 --> 13:15.760
you need a strategic plan knowing what to publish where at what pace and with whom.

13:16.480 --> 13:25.040
So how to get published I would say it really depends on your research interests and on your

13:25.040 --> 13:34.480
field so you need to know within that field what topics are hot. It's pretty easy if you go to a

13:34.480 --> 13:41.680
conference or you look at the conference program of a recent conference you know you you check

13:42.640 --> 13:53.920
what topics are being discussed and what seems to be creating buzz because you don't want to

13:54.720 --> 14:00.800
start working and trying to publish something on a topic that is considered that is no longer

14:00.800 --> 14:06.560
considered cool or hot it needs to be something that people are currently interested in because

14:06.560 --> 14:14.720
that's what will hand you a job at the point so it's important also to create a network of people

14:15.840 --> 14:24.560
who have similar interests so go to conferences try to talk to the plenary speakers during

14:24.560 --> 14:31.040
coffee breaks or during the conference dinner contact authors if there is a paper out that

14:31.040 --> 14:36.480
you're interested in but you can't access it if you flatter them a little bit they will typically

14:36.880 --> 14:45.040
send you the pdf also keep an eye out on calls for papers of conferences or special issues or

14:45.040 --> 14:52.560
answer books on the topic that you are interested in so what to publish it could be a small research

14:52.560 --> 15:00.720
project pilot studies I recommend where all my PhD students I have recommended that they try to

15:01.600 --> 15:09.920
turn the most interesting findings of their MA thesis or dissertation into a little publication

15:11.120 --> 15:17.600
you could also publish a critical review of literature on a topic and plenty of journals

15:17.600 --> 15:25.760
that are interested in critical reviews you could write some critical analysis of a popular concept

15:25.840 --> 15:33.360
or contribute to a discussion forum and and as I said before book reviews are really a good way

15:33.360 --> 15:42.080
to get free books and these books are typically very expensive so what is you simply contact

15:42.080 --> 15:51.280
the reviews editor of a journal tell him or her that you are a PhD student or a master student

15:51.280 --> 15:57.760
with a huge interest in this topic and that you notice that this expensive new book came out and

15:57.760 --> 16:04.640
that you would love to review it for the journal and that typically implies writing 2000 writing

16:04.640 --> 16:12.000
2000 words where you point out what you liked and what you didn't like much about the book

16:12.880 --> 16:19.440
don't be too harsh because the author of that book may be your future employer so you need to be

16:20.240 --> 16:27.440
careful and then the book reviews editor will contact the editor and will send you a free copy

16:27.440 --> 16:34.080
of the book and you typically have three months to write your book review then the other one is the

16:34.080 --> 16:40.640
standard research paper typically between six and twelve thousand words there are also journals

16:40.640 --> 16:47.040
that have options for shorter papers research in progress so that's typically somewhere between

16:47.040 --> 16:53.840
three thousand and four thousand words and then there are also review papers where you write a review

16:53.840 --> 17:04.720
of a particular area in the field um oh so before writing I would say that you need to come up you

17:04.720 --> 17:11.520
need to develop an intuition or a gut feeling that something is original and is worth investigating

17:11.520 --> 17:18.480
and that you happen to be the best person to do it and it's an intuition that you can typically

17:18.480 --> 17:25.840
discuss with your supervisor because as supervisors we are very happy when students come up with

17:25.840 --> 17:35.440
original ideas and I have published many papers with former bachelor students or master students

17:35.440 --> 17:42.800
who came up with a really interesting idea and I thought oh yeah great let me supervise you properly

17:42.800 --> 17:50.080
and let's make sure that we get good data and then they got a good grade for their BA or master

17:50.080 --> 17:57.360
dissertation but of course these BA and master dissertations even if they have high grades they

17:57.360 --> 18:05.760
are not necessarily publishable to turn a dissertation into a paper requires a lot of a lot of work so

18:06.320 --> 18:15.360
we then turned it into papers and they got published so you need to formalize the intuition you need

18:15.360 --> 18:25.600
to come up with a research design you need to develop a hypothesis based on previous literature

18:25.600 --> 18:31.440
on previous research so you need a proper literature review then you collect the data

18:32.400 --> 18:40.320
you as I said before you sort it you analyze it you see to what extent it confirms or disconfirms

18:40.320 --> 18:46.320
previous research and what you do is really adding a grain of sand to the pyramid of knowledge

18:46.720 --> 18:49.680
so I say that because

18:52.880 --> 18:59.360
we shouldn't be over ambitious in the sense that the paper doesn't need to be revolutionary it

18:59.360 --> 19:07.040
doesn't need to be the the 10 commandments that Moses came down with from his mountain

19:07.600 --> 19:12.720
it just needs to be one gleaming beautiful perfectly

19:15.680 --> 19:21.200
formed grain of sand and you add that to the pyramid of knowledge and you will have done your job

19:22.480 --> 19:27.280
so it's good to assemble the data all the data before you start writing the paper

19:28.400 --> 19:36.320
and I would say that when you write you write up the data do it as if you were talking to colleagues

19:38.000 --> 19:44.160
then another question is whether you should go for co-authored or signal publications

19:45.120 --> 19:52.240
I would say that it depends on the field in literature research most papers are signal authored

19:52.880 --> 20:00.480
in social sciences in applied linguistics it's more common to see co-authored papers typically

20:01.280 --> 20:09.040
between two and five authors if you look at physics for example or exact sciences stem

20:09.760 --> 20:15.120
research you sometimes see a list of 10 authors because they are all the members of the lab

20:15.680 --> 20:26.080
so that is rather unusual in applied linguistics it can be a great idea to co-author something

20:26.160 --> 20:33.600
with somebody who has more experience than you because they know the ropes and they know how to

20:33.600 --> 20:43.120
react to sharp comments by reviewers and they they know that if a reviewer recommends something

20:43.120 --> 20:48.560
that you disagree with that you have the right to disagree and explain why you disagree and why

20:48.560 --> 20:55.760
you will not follow the reviewer's recommendation and you may even have to appeal to the editor

20:55.760 --> 21:00.880
saying you know reviewer three is asking me to drop this but I really think this is crucial

21:01.600 --> 21:10.080
for this and this and this reason and so it's important to learn the practices in

21:11.840 --> 21:19.520
publishing in applied linguistics I like co-authoring because I like working with people who have

21:19.520 --> 21:28.320
skills that I don't have to the same extent for example I've been working with in Luis Botez

21:28.320 --> 21:36.160
and Chen Chen Li who have amazing statistical skills there so they are psychometric specialists

21:36.160 --> 21:42.000
so they can do things with stats that I couldn't do because I'm more self-taught

21:42.960 --> 21:53.280
statistician and and it's great and then I help them write a good story and find some

21:53.280 --> 22:01.600
interesting metaphors so finding the right journal that's a crucial and difficult question

22:02.880 --> 22:07.040
do you go for the top journal or do you go for a lower ranked journal

22:08.000 --> 22:14.960
and do you go for quantity or quality and my recommendation would be to aim for balance

22:14.960 --> 22:20.240
where you have some quick intimate I wouldn't say low level in fact but more intermediate level

22:21.120 --> 22:27.520
publications like conference proceedings web-based journals and then I would recommend

22:27.520 --> 22:35.600
spending a lot of time and energy to try and get at least one paper into a really prestigious journal

22:35.680 --> 22:44.560
because future selection committees will look at UCV and will say okay some conference proceedings

22:44.560 --> 22:53.600
some mid-level journals but wow one paper in a really good journal and if you can do one then

22:53.600 --> 23:01.600
the assumption is that you can do more so I would also say recommend that you send your best work

23:01.600 --> 23:08.160
to the best journals so check whether the impact factor is high whether you know the people who

23:08.160 --> 23:16.080
publish in that journal again ask advice to supervisors I would absolutely avoid non-referee

23:16.080 --> 23:26.160
journals unless it's reviews or opinion pieces also avoid edited volumes with editors that don't

23:26.160 --> 23:37.440
have a name in the field or working with co-authors that you don't trust much or you don't have much

23:37.440 --> 23:48.160
of a reputation unless they are your students and avoid also volumes published by publishers that are

23:48.160 --> 23:56.800
so-called pirate publishers there are a number of them and you need absolutely to avoid

23:57.440 --> 24:03.520
publishing there so again that's something that you need to ask your supervisor and then the other

24:03.520 --> 24:09.760
thing is that you probably need to avoid editors that work slowly because if you're at the start of

24:09.760 --> 24:14.400
your career you don't want to wait two or three years for a chapter to come out

24:15.200 --> 24:25.680
so as I said avoid predatory journal open access these days is becoming more

24:27.040 --> 24:38.400
common institutions typically pay the to have the paper out in open access but you need to avoid

24:38.400 --> 24:50.320
these so-called predatory journals so be extremely careful they typically contact you after you

24:50.320 --> 24:57.760
presented something at the conference something that leaves a trace on the internet and then

24:57.760 --> 25:06.320
they will you will get an invitation saying you know we we noticed that you produced this

25:06.320 --> 25:14.400
magnificent or that you presented this magnificent paper we we think you are brilliant now will you

25:14.400 --> 25:23.120
please submit your paper in our journal run away delete straight away because if somebody flatters

25:23.120 --> 25:34.000
you it's probably a scam so because then there will be hidden payments the quality will be crap

25:34.720 --> 25:44.000
and it risks in fact undermining your academic credibility so make sure you check

25:44.560 --> 25:51.440
where you submit your paper now what to avoid in the paper and I'm saying this because as editor

25:52.080 --> 26:00.880
I come across about 800 papers a year submitted to my journal and and I would typically reject

26:00.880 --> 26:10.080
the ones that have very superficial literature reviews where there is just some reference

26:10.080 --> 26:16.320
dropping but there isn't any critical engagement with the studies presented

26:18.240 --> 26:24.560
also avoid claiming that very little research has been done in an area if you're not 100

26:24.560 --> 26:30.960
percent sure and it's hard to be 100 percent sure because you can't know everything that has

26:30.960 --> 26:38.400
been published and and it could be the reviewer reading your paper who happened to have produced

26:38.400 --> 26:44.800
some research in that topic and he or she will be angry with you for claiming that very little

26:44.800 --> 26:52.720
has been done also crucial to make sure that the text looks good sloppiness is dangerous

26:53.520 --> 26:58.880
so make sure you stick to the style sheet of the journal that the references are in the right

26:58.880 --> 27:04.560
format double check whether everything in the list of references is mentioned in the text and vice

27:04.560 --> 27:15.200
versa make sure the spelling of surnames is correct because it really pisses a reviewer

27:15.200 --> 27:23.600
of if his or her surname is badly spelled also avoid making sweeping generalizations

27:23.600 --> 27:33.120
so always be very careful in discussing the the the results because what applies to

27:33.920 --> 27:42.400
your particular data set might not apply to data sets collected from different participants

27:42.400 --> 27:49.360
in different environments also avoid claims that cannot be substantiated and avoid a rhetorical

27:49.360 --> 27:54.560
style that does not match that of the journal I would add to that avoid

27:57.200 --> 28:04.640
taking sides in whatever argument you are presenting so you are writing an impartial

28:04.960 --> 28:12.560
paper you are writing a paper on a topic you cannot choose a position so if you're not writing a

28:12.560 --> 28:19.280
pamphlet to attack something or to defend something you are looking at with an impartial

28:20.560 --> 28:28.000
pair of eyes and you may come to a conclusion that this is more correct than that or that you

28:28.640 --> 28:37.920
prefer this to that but the paper cannot be written like it would be a pamphlet

28:39.680 --> 28:46.320
so to get your paper accepted it's crucial to keep it simple so the story needs to be

28:46.880 --> 28:53.520
a specific story on one specific theme so better to explain one idea in detail than too many

28:53.600 --> 29:01.520
superficially and I would say that is a typical beginner's mistake beginner researcher want to

29:01.520 --> 29:11.440
cram in too many ideas so my golden rule is less is more so the one idea needs to be

29:12.480 --> 29:20.080
visible in the title must come clearly through in the abstract in the opening of the introduction

29:20.080 --> 29:27.040
and again in the conclusion so people get it what the idea was so also follow the style and

29:27.040 --> 29:32.960
the structure of papers published in the journal that you have in mind and if you think oh this is

29:32.960 --> 29:41.760
also such a good idea I could also put it in there in fact my advice is split it off cut and paste

29:41.760 --> 29:49.760
it in a separate document something that you can develop later try not to put too many eggs

29:50.000 --> 29:56.400
in the one basket also think hard about the title when you finish the paper because sometimes you

29:56.400 --> 30:02.480
start with a working title and then at the very end of the paper finishing the paper you realize

30:02.480 --> 30:08.400
that in fact you need to revisit the title because the the the idea may have shifted a little bit

30:08.400 --> 30:15.280
you may have focused on one aspect rather than what you announced in the title and and the title

30:15.280 --> 30:23.280
really will determine whether or not your paper is cited if it's too long too clunky

30:25.280 --> 30:32.640
it won't get much attention so also having a catchy title is good but don't there is no need to

30:32.640 --> 30:38.880
have a catchy title but if you can come up with something catchy that that gets people's attention

30:38.880 --> 30:46.000
that would certainly help so writing tips I would say writing a good introduction

30:46.000 --> 30:52.400
in fact the first sentence is crucial if you don't catch the attention of the reader

30:53.520 --> 30:58.480
and you don't convey the importance of the questions addressed in in that first sentence in

30:58.480 --> 31:05.200
that first paragraph nobody is going to read the rest of the text so I would say that I

31:05.200 --> 31:11.440
just reject again paper submitted to my journal if I read the introduction well I read the abstract

31:11.440 --> 31:17.760
and I read the introduction and if halfway through the introduction I still don't know what this

31:17.760 --> 31:24.720
paper is about I reject it because they didn't catch my attention so text can be written in

31:24.720 --> 31:30.560
the past or present tense past tense okay if you describe results of an experiment but typically

31:30.560 --> 31:39.840
present tense if it's a general conclusion good to write if you write in English you need to write

31:39.840 --> 31:46.640
short sentences shorter than you would if you were writing in French or Italian for example

31:48.240 --> 31:57.440
also avoid fluffy hermetic and complex ways of saying a simple thing so I would say that the

31:57.520 --> 32:06.400
Anglo-Saxon requirement is really to not beat around the bush be as clear and as simple as possible

32:07.920 --> 32:13.040
now I want to talk to you about something I find really interesting which is

32:13.920 --> 32:19.840
comes from chaos theory and the dynamic systems theory which is the butterfly effect

32:20.400 --> 32:29.920
namely the fact that a new idea at some point in time may feel like nothing more than the flapping

32:29.920 --> 32:38.480
of wings and I don't know whether you know this metaphor of the butterfly effect it's the flapping

32:38.480 --> 32:51.120
of the wings of a butterfly today in Poznan may be linked to a storm in Italy in two weeks because

32:52.240 --> 33:00.800
it could have unexpected consequences and because the world is a dynamic system

33:00.960 --> 33:08.560
you don't know exactly what the consequences will be in our case of a particular paper

33:09.120 --> 33:15.760
so sometimes a paper gets published and doesn't get cited very much for a couple of years and

33:15.760 --> 33:22.560
then suddenly there is growing interest in the area and suddenly that paper may get started to

33:22.800 --> 33:29.440
be cited more and more and you could say that you could say that that paper was in fact

33:30.000 --> 33:39.280
the butterfly and that it had unexpected consequences or effects on the field

33:39.920 --> 33:46.880
and so butterflies you could refer to butterflies by famous researchers like Galileo

33:46.880 --> 33:57.200
when he first published his rejection of the geocentric model saying that you know the earth

33:57.200 --> 34:08.160
circulates around the the sun very few people believed him and the church was very angry

34:08.160 --> 34:13.200
and with him for making that claim and in the end it turned out that he was right

34:14.160 --> 34:22.320
same with Einstein who introduced relativity again something that not many people believed

34:22.320 --> 34:29.760
could be true when it was first published and then became the dominant paradigm in physics

34:29.760 --> 34:40.240
and then I would also say that sometimes the butterflies can be political and I'm thinking

34:40.240 --> 34:48.320
here about Tarek el Tayev Mohammed Bouazzi who was a modest street vendor and he set himself

34:48.320 --> 34:56.560
on fire in 2010 in Tunisia and it was an act that led to the Tunisian revolution so the poor man was

34:56.560 --> 35:09.200
desperate and wanted to express his protest in that act of self-immolation and that had consequences

35:09.760 --> 35:18.480
so he was a kind of a butterfly now another thing that I'm interested in is how

35:20.000 --> 35:26.800
research develops within sciences and how it develops within applied linguistics

35:26.800 --> 35:33.520
and how that development is typically non-linear and I recommend the book by Thomas Kuhn on the

35:33.520 --> 35:41.840
structure of scientific revolutions so where he explains that science goes through paradigm shifts

35:42.800 --> 35:48.320
where current theories can't explain some phenomenon someone proposes a new theory

35:48.320 --> 36:00.480
so I would say that when Galileo came in he pointed out that the the observations did not

36:00.480 --> 36:11.440
allow him to confirm the theory that earth was the center of the universe so more and more

36:11.440 --> 36:20.000
observations led to the rejection of the old geocentric model and the introduction of the new

36:20.800 --> 36:29.120
heliocentric model so that was a typical paradigm shift so this revolution occurs when the new

36:29.200 --> 36:36.160
paradigm is better at explaining the observations offers a model that is closer to the objective

36:36.160 --> 36:45.280
external reality and that the new paradigm is incommensurate with the old one so examples of

36:45.280 --> 36:53.200
paradigm shifts in applied linguistics if you are a master student in applied linguistics you know

36:53.200 --> 37:02.560
that it was behaviorism that it ended in fact when Chomsky in 1959 reviewed Skinner's verbal

37:02.560 --> 37:12.240
behavior and where Chomsky said in fact language is not a collection of reinforced habits as the

37:12.240 --> 37:21.120
behaviorists claimed children use language creatively so it was a kind it was the death

37:21.120 --> 37:31.680
now for behaviorism in applied linguistics at the time also we have had a contrastive analysis

37:32.240 --> 37:39.280
that was also inspired by behaviorism seeing language as a set of habits with second language

37:39.280 --> 37:45.840
acquisition being the establishment of new habits where it was assumed that if there were errors in

37:45.840 --> 37:53.200
the second language they were caused by the first language and the prediction that the

37:53.200 --> 37:58.080
bigger the difference between a structure in the first and the second language the more errors

37:58.080 --> 38:05.920
would occur in the second language and then Zobel was among those who pointed out that

38:05.920 --> 38:11.280
French learners of English failed to show evidence of the predictor error but English learners of

38:11.280 --> 38:20.160
French did so in French for those of you who know French you can say je les vois in English you

38:20.160 --> 38:27.600
would have to put the object pronoun after the verb so you would say I see them however looking at

38:27.600 --> 38:35.040
learner data Zobel realized that French learners of English never said things like I them see

38:36.000 --> 38:43.280
which would be the expected pattern because then they would transfer their French syntactic pattern

38:43.280 --> 38:53.120
yet English learners of French did produce sentences like je vois et instead of je la vois

38:53.120 --> 39:01.040
so the interference didn't go in both directions so the transfer of habits was not consistent across

39:01.120 --> 39:11.120
languages okay so that was until now the the general advice about doing research

39:12.160 --> 39:18.800
in applied linguistics and about the butterfly effects and I would say that in a certain sense

39:19.360 --> 39:28.880
we all have experienced butterfly effects meaning that we have all done certain things

39:28.880 --> 39:36.800
that led us on to certain paths and that we could not have predicted where they would take us so

39:36.800 --> 39:44.240
when I started my career and so I will talk about these butterfly effects and and these trigger

39:44.240 --> 39:53.120
events in in my own career and I started doing a masters in French in Brussels and I did my

39:53.760 --> 40:02.480
master's dissertation on a theoretical topic namely a famous French linguist called Gustave

40:02.480 --> 40:12.480
Guillaume and I managed to publish the findings of that dissertation in Travaux de Languistique

40:13.440 --> 40:23.440
and I was really into theoretical French linguistics at the time but then my once I

40:23.440 --> 40:28.880
started doing my PhD it was a PhD in applied linguistics on the acquisition of French as

40:28.880 --> 40:35.840
a foreign language and I kind of abandoned theoretical linguistics and became more interested

40:35.840 --> 40:42.160
in applied linguistics and so my first applied linguistic paper appeared in 92 was on the omission

40:42.240 --> 40:49.920
of Neu in French interlanguage so that was in fact a combination of social linguistics and

40:49.920 --> 40:57.760
applied linguistics and then I published my first papers in French then realized that I would probably

40:59.120 --> 41:05.040
reach a wider audience if I wrote the papers in English but my English wasn't that good so I had

41:05.040 --> 41:16.880
to ask a friend to help me out and so by 2000 I was writing in English and I was interested there

41:17.520 --> 41:23.360
also in gender assignment and gender agreement in advanced French interlanguage that was

41:23.360 --> 41:33.120
part of my PhD dissertation and I also became interested in the use of colloquial words and

41:33.200 --> 41:38.800
emotional words and swear words in advanced French interlanguage so I was still very much

41:39.360 --> 41:46.400
focused on French as a second language at the start of my career and then I had

41:48.160 --> 41:54.960
critical incidents so I encountered my colleagues when I joined Bergbeck in 1994

41:55.680 --> 42:04.240
I realized that I had gaps in my social pragmatic competence in English I was able to understand

42:06.560 --> 42:11.760
I was able to understand most of what my colleagues said but I didn't always understand what they

42:11.760 --> 42:19.040
actually meant so I understood the words but I didn't always get what their emotions were

42:19.200 --> 42:25.680
and what they really meant so I couldn't really read between the stiff upper lips of my colleague

42:26.480 --> 42:37.360
and then I had a chat with an aunt of mine who worked in palliative care and ELSE is her name

42:37.360 --> 42:44.000
and she asked me so what do you do I said oh well you know I teach at the university and I do research

42:44.000 --> 42:53.280
and I had just published it was the conversation happened in to early 2001 and I said you know and

42:53.280 --> 43:03.520
I have had just this paper out on how learners of French agree gender sometimes and sometimes they

43:03.520 --> 43:09.120
don't and isn't that fascinating and and she looked at me and she said so you are really splitting

43:09.120 --> 43:17.520
hairs and I thought oh that's not very kind but I laughed and I said well I guess so yeah but you

43:17.520 --> 43:24.960
know it's my hobby and I get paid to do it but it felt a bit lame and then 9-11 happened and I felt

43:24.960 --> 43:31.200
that suddenly as applied linguists there was an urgent need for us to promote peace tolerance of

43:31.200 --> 43:37.920
diversity in fact the underlining the value of multilingualism and multiculturalism and

43:38.080 --> 43:42.880
positive thinking and that it was our moral duty as applied linguists to do some good

43:42.880 --> 43:51.360
for society that we needed to get out of our ivory towers and so I left the ivory tower and

43:51.360 --> 44:02.640
met a huge amount of people and a few names there a picture there with Beverly Costa we got an award

44:02.640 --> 44:12.880
for our work then bottom left is with Kasia Saito who's a great friend and then in the middle a picture

44:12.880 --> 44:21.120
with Peter McIntyre, Tammy Gregerson and Elaine Horitz and Sarah Mercer who became lifelong friends

44:21.840 --> 44:30.320
and to the right there holding the distinguished scholarship award from AAA L Annetta Pavlenko

44:31.040 --> 44:38.960
surrounded by Peter De Costa and Lourdes Ortega so all these people became really good friends

44:38.960 --> 44:47.200
and I realized that one of my early papers really had an impact we were among the first to introduce

44:47.200 --> 44:56.880
the word emotion in applied linguistics and in a paper in 2002 and then Annetta and I realized

44:56.880 --> 45:02.160
that the emotion was really an interesting topic that not much had been written about it

45:02.160 --> 45:08.640
and that we could organize panels on emotions and multilingualism at different conferences

45:08.640 --> 45:14.080
which is what we did in the early 2000s and then based on these panels we

45:15.840 --> 45:24.000
guest edited special issues in different journals and so we attracted attention to the topic and

45:24.000 --> 45:35.280
we invited colleagues to join us and then we developed a follow-up study we developed a

45:35.280 --> 45:41.200
bilingualism and emotion questionnaire which was probably the first and the biggest online

45:41.200 --> 45:49.040
questionnaire in applied linguistics it remained online for two years collected data from over 1500

45:49.040 --> 45:55.520
multilinguals and those of you who listened to my first talk remember that it was about

45:56.160 --> 46:05.040
language preferences to express emotions also information on proficiency on anxiety and we

46:05.040 --> 46:10.400
found that the first language is typically preferred for communication of emotion and it's

46:10.400 --> 46:17.120
typically felt to have most emotional resonance so once we had all those data we published papers

46:17.120 --> 46:23.120
on that and then we realized that we both had to publish a book on it and that it would be

46:23.120 --> 46:29.920
more helpful to each have a separate book rather than to have a co-author book so Annetta published

46:29.920 --> 46:42.800
her book pretty soon in 2005 and then I published mine five years later with a slightly different

46:42.800 --> 46:53.280
focus and so the mine was more had more statistics in it than Annetta and you I don't remember whether

46:53.280 --> 47:02.640
I told you that the face the self-portrait on the cover of my book is in fact a painting that is

47:02.640 --> 47:10.080
hanging here in my office it's the self-portrait by my maternal grandfather from 1933 and he was

47:10.080 --> 47:16.640
a passionate bilingual so I thought right he's the perfect person and this is the perfect

47:18.640 --> 47:28.800
cover for my book and then in 2005 I was also among the first to call for more attention to

47:28.800 --> 47:35.200
psychological and emotional dimensions in second language acquisition research and again I didn't

47:35.200 --> 47:45.920
know at the time that that paper would get cited quite a lot and then interesting emotion research

47:45.920 --> 47:52.320
started to develop more gradually in applied linguistics it had been dominantly cognitive

47:52.320 --> 47:58.960
until the time with the focus on observable and measurable units and I had this chat with John

47:58.960 --> 48:04.400
Schumann who's one of the founders of applied linguistics and professor of applied linguistics

48:04.400 --> 48:16.480
at UCLA in California and he said well you know it's about applied linguists wanting to make sure

48:16.480 --> 48:22.960
that they are taken seriously that they do that they are real scientists so they use sophisticated

48:22.960 --> 48:33.840
statistics so they can legitimately be considered as scientists and he said emotions are probably

48:33.840 --> 48:40.080
less attractive because they have no observable physical reference in the world and they fell

48:40.080 --> 48:50.880
outside of the traditional remit of second language acquisition so the winds of change started to come

48:50.880 --> 48:57.520
with the introduction of more qualitative research in applied linguistics where it suddenly became

48:57.520 --> 49:04.640
okay to look at the L2 learners subjective side that included emotion, investment, duty,

49:04.640 --> 49:13.040
love, desire and I refer here to the work by Claire Kramsch and Anita Pavlenko and I think I also

49:13.920 --> 49:20.560
reminded you during my first session about the metaphor about emotions being the elephant in

49:20.560 --> 49:26.800
the room that everybody knows they are there but they are not really taken into consideration

49:26.800 --> 49:33.600
because they are considered to be inferior to rational thought and hopefully this change now

49:33.600 --> 49:39.920
with the prior saying that yeah there is an elephant but it's time to open the windows and

49:39.920 --> 49:48.160
to move on and so we have had the so-called emotional term and also the effective term

49:48.320 --> 50:00.240
in fact I guess applied linguists and authors love to coin a nice new collocation linked to

50:00.240 --> 50:05.360
their name so emotional term effective term they are good collocation see it shows that

50:05.360 --> 50:12.880
there suddenly is some kind of maybe not paradigm shift but mini paradigm shift

50:13.680 --> 50:23.760
also I ran the ngram viewer to look at the use of the word emotion in written text since the

50:23.760 --> 50:34.160
1800s and you see that there's been a sharp increase in the word emotion since the 1990s

50:34.160 --> 50:39.600
really so I would say that my interest in emotional and applied linguistics in a sense

50:39.920 --> 50:47.520
reflects an increased interest in that word and an increased use of that word

50:48.320 --> 50:54.960
across different disciplines across different genres and styles so I guess there is more

50:56.960 --> 51:04.880
publicity ads that play on our emotions today than they would have 40 years ago

51:05.840 --> 51:10.720
also although there wasn't much about emotion in applied linguistics in fact there were

51:10.720 --> 51:18.720
emotional journals in psychology and these three journals were all established late 20th century

51:18.720 --> 51:28.960
early of our current century so you see that there was interest in emotion that it typically

51:29.040 --> 51:36.720
started at that point but it took a little while before it came into applied linguistics and

51:37.920 --> 51:48.640
the introduction in Dorne and Ryan in 2015 is telling in that the authors say that of course

51:52.240 --> 51:57.600
the classic individual differences paradigm in applied linguistics barely acknowledges

51:57.600 --> 52:05.760
the central role of emotions and feelings and emotions play a huge part in all our lives

52:05.760 --> 52:10.800
they have been shunned to a large extent by both psychology and second language acquisition

52:11.440 --> 52:17.840
literature so there is a general emotional deficit and they acknowledge

52:18.640 --> 52:26.400
that the 2005 version of their book reflected this trend so it was an ongoing conversation

52:26.400 --> 52:34.960
I had with Zoltan and with Steven Ryan that that emotion needed more attention and why

52:34.960 --> 52:40.880
weren't they talking about emotion more and so I was pretty happy in 2015 when they acknowledged

52:40.880 --> 52:48.640
that yes they should have talked more about emotion and then I also realized that of course

52:49.440 --> 52:57.440
our research is spread over different fields that in the social psychological research tradition

52:57.440 --> 53:04.480
motivation researchers typically had included anxiety dimensions but had never included

53:04.480 --> 53:09.200
positive emotion dimensions if there were positive emotions there were typically item

53:09.200 --> 53:18.400
level emotions like I like my English class but there wasn't a proper foreign language

53:18.480 --> 53:25.600
enjoyment dimension for example and most research on emotions had focused on foreign language

53:25.600 --> 53:31.520
classroom anxiety also looking at applied linguistics there is in fact only one journal

53:32.160 --> 53:38.160
journal for the psychology of language learning that has the word psychology in the title and I

53:38.160 --> 53:42.880
also added the journal of language and social psychology but that's in fact a psychological

53:42.880 --> 53:53.520
paper so it's a social psychological journal I talked to you in my second session about

53:54.800 --> 54:01.440
learner emotions and how the interest in learner emotions came after the introduction of positive

54:01.440 --> 54:09.440
psychology in applied linguistics 2012 paper by Pete McIntyre and Gregerson and then a 2014

54:10.400 --> 54:16.560
paper also by McIntyre and Mercer about what positive psychology could bring to second language

54:16.560 --> 54:26.800
acquisition research it was followed by two edited books one edited in Poland by Danuta

54:26.800 --> 54:34.240
Gampis Barker and her colleague Dagmara on positive psychology perspectives in foreign

54:34.320 --> 54:40.640
language learning and teaching and also a book published by Multilingual Matters edited by

54:40.640 --> 54:48.240
McIntyre Gregerson and Mercer on positive psychology in SNA and the publication of these two books

54:48.240 --> 54:57.120
helped strengthen the growing interest in positive psychology in learner emotions and also later

54:57.120 --> 55:04.720
in teacher emotions and then in my second session I presented the paper that I co-authored

55:04.720 --> 55:11.760
with Peter McIntyre the Two Faces of Yanus where we presented the concept of foreign language

55:11.760 --> 55:25.680
enjoyment it's been my most cited paper and then also with Chen Chen Li we published a paper in

55:25.680 --> 55:31.840
a Chinese journal which I like because we shouldn't just publish in international

55:34.160 --> 55:42.880
journals we should also publish in national journals where we talked about the four or

55:42.880 --> 55:50.000
the three phases of emotions where they were first avoided because cognition was the only

55:50.000 --> 55:56.880
thing that mattered then the second phase where there was interest in anxiety including the work

55:56.880 --> 56:05.280
by crashing on his effective filter hypothesis and then Elena's horrid foreign language classroom

56:05.280 --> 56:12.000
anxiety and the phase we are currently in which is a positive and negative emotions phase

56:12.000 --> 56:17.120
thanks to the emotional turn and positive psychology where we've taken a more holistic

56:17.120 --> 56:24.240
view on emotions and look at a variety of different emotions that learners and teachers

56:24.240 --> 56:33.520
may experience so we conceptualized enjoyment as this complex and positive emotion that occurs

56:33.520 --> 56:40.640
when people not just meet their needs but exceed them do something unexpected you may remember that

56:40.640 --> 56:48.080
I cited the meta-analysis that showed that if you suffer from high anxiety in your classroom

56:48.080 --> 56:55.360
you typically don't do as well whereas if you enjoy your foreign language classroom a lot

56:55.360 --> 57:01.840
you are typically more willing to communicate and you typically will have better results so the

57:01.840 --> 57:09.440
pedagogical implication of that is that teachers can create optimal positive atmosphere so part of

57:09.520 --> 57:19.680
my research output has been the creation of new instruments and those turned out to be highly

57:19.680 --> 57:25.680
cited although we didn't really do it to get high citation but if you develop a new instrument

57:25.680 --> 57:32.960
to do further research on a certain topic they need to be solid and so you see I love collaborating

57:32.960 --> 57:41.760
with Ilwis Bottes and Chen Chen Li to do this and then you know I don't want to read this out

57:41.760 --> 57:49.680
obviously but we did a lot of work on the sources and the effects of enjoyment anxiety and boredom

57:50.800 --> 57:58.560
how that is linked to teacher behavior how different positive personality traits are linked

57:58.560 --> 58:05.120
to willingness to communicate and to performance how it's linked to trait emotional intelligence

58:05.920 --> 58:12.160
we also looked at enjoyment in first language classes and discovered that it is that different

58:12.160 --> 58:19.440
from foreign language classes and yeah and then more recently I did a couple of

58:20.640 --> 58:26.960
studies on teacher emotions teachers who are forced to smile in front of a class when they

58:26.960 --> 58:35.840
don't feel like smiling because they are tired or stressed and and also the the role of the teacher

58:35.840 --> 58:41.680
in front of the class where through a process of emotional contagion a happy teacher can make the

58:41.680 --> 58:51.040
whole classroom happy unhappy teacher can also contain you know in fact the everybody and where

58:51.040 --> 58:56.800
everybody feels depressed so as a teacher you really need that emotional labor to keep a smile on

58:56.800 --> 59:04.560
your face and on the face of your your students and then with Prihati Ergun we looked at the link

59:04.560 --> 59:10.160
between well-being resilience and foreign language teaching enjoyment so that that's another

59:10.160 --> 59:20.240
interesting concept so what what makes a teacher enjoy his or her teaching and and to what extent

59:20.240 --> 59:28.640
is it linked to teacher internal variables like well-being and resilience and then I did a lot of

59:28.640 --> 59:38.960
work thanks to a PhD student of mine on emotion recognition and so how do we recognize how a

59:38.960 --> 59:48.720
multilingual feels when we watch or an audio when we watch a video recording or when we listen to an

59:48.720 --> 59:57.760
audio recording and and this turns out to to to be an area of research that that really caught my

59:57.760 --> 01:00:04.560
attention and and it was thanks to this PhD student Pernell Lorette and a number of other

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:13.360
lovely colleagues and then I think also in my first lecture that I mentioned how my interest in emotion

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:23.280
developed into the more specific context of multilingualism in psychotherapy

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:32.800
where we discovered that very often multilingual clients feel that their multilingualism and

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:40.240
multiculturalism is not sufficiently addressed in therapy and that there are also differences

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:48.560
between monolingual and multilingual therapists in how they deal with their with their clients and

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:55.840
that research won us a reward an award from the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:03.600
so it was clear that we had been doing something original that had practical implications and

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.920
the practical implications we worked on them trying to raise awareness about multilingualism

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:17.680
and the issues that this implies for the psychotherapist and we published a couple of papers

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:26.560
on that topic also thanks to Beverly Costa we try to disseminate our findings to a larger audience

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:35.440
and Beverly Costa not only did she train about 3000 trainee therapists in a program called

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:42.640
Improving Access to Psychological Therapists in the UK training also a clinical supervisor

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:52.640
but she also had the brilliant idea to hire an established author to turn to

01:01:54.640 --> 01:02:04.000
turn our research findings and her case notes into a play so Andrew Weir wrote the session

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:16.080
based on an original idea by Mother Tong and it's about a Polish woman married to a British man

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:23.200
and they have communication problems and he doesn't value her cultural background enough and

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:33.360
there is some trauma about the child and so it was performed at the Soho Theatre and about

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:40.800
3000 people came to see that play and so the play was really about the issues that we had

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:48.080
found in our research and that was a nice way to disseminate the findings also our research

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:55.280
had an impact in that the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapists clearly

01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:04.000
added the importance of being aware of unconscious linguistic bias assumptions

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:13.040
and privilege if you work with multilingual clients the crucial need to offer linguistically

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:18.560
sensitive supervision acknowledging the role of language and identity development processing

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:25.360
of trauma memory recall and emotional expression so that was in fact clearly linked to the work

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.080
I had been doing with Beverly Costa and that applies to the UK but it implies in fact it

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:38.560
applies to other contexts also of course so to conclude I would say that research doesn't

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.640
emerge in a vacuum that emotion research emerged against the odds that was kind of inevitable

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.480
that intense academic socialization collaboration needs to join development and new ideas

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:58.240
I think it really helps to write in English to reach a wider audience I think it's also crucial

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.480
to talk to people from neighboring disciplines for cross-fertilization and that doing research is

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:10.560
just fantastic it's exhilarating intoxicating unpredictable and I would say that it is absolutely

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:17.440
worth the effort and because there were so many words I want to finish with some pictures so the

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.520
top left picture you will recognize the face of Zoltan Doge at the conference dinner in

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:32.400
grass in 2014 and beneath that is a Jew who is sitting on the floor during a triple AL conference

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:41.280
being in a packed room and being a bit tired and at the bottom left there I was at an emotion

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:49.040
conference with my then current PhD and former PhD students and then the other pictures again

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:57.520
walking going to conferences having dinners and top right is my friend Lee Wei giving a

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:06.240
plenary at conferences meaning what I'm saying here is that research happens because you are

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:12.480
collaborating with absolutely lovely people and if somebody turns out not to be lovely you just

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.240
drop them and you work with the ones that you appreciate and that keep their word and that

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:25.920
have the integrity and honesty and friendship and if they can bake banana breads when you

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.360
go to a conference and they give you a bit of banana bread that's even better that's a hint

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:38.960
because that's what Jakub did at the last euro slot conference so many thanks and I hope you will

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:49.680
have some questions for me encouraged by all means and the priority goes to the people in the room

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:56.000
you know that you can approach this place anytime you are not seen because the camera is off

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.160
so all you need is a bit of courage we had that happen before so if you think of asking a question

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.960
now is the perfect opportunity first of all the people in the hall

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:21.200
especially those people who are thinking of doing perhaps further research and applied linguistics

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.760
I can see that there is a question in the chat

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.040
all right

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:42.640
yes let me start with the first hello hello Joe Mark can you hear me okay go ahead yes

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.800
it's Jace Krisevich

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:55.600
I decided to to write you to write a question or rather not a question but a comment

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:02.240
so if you if you don't mind I will just I would just read the read those out so

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:11.040
I have two comments to make first of all I'd be cautious to take to advise young scholars

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:19.040
in the first half of your lecture here to better publish something than nothing

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.040
even though you immediately done played this with the recommendation not to publish crap

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:33.440
what I think is that unfortunately in in the majority of cases the urge and the pressure

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:44.240
on young people to to publish and the imperative to do so especially nowadays in what I call mass

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:50.160
university culture where we have dozens and dozens and dozens of phd students

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:55.680
taking interest in second language acquisition first language acquisition god knows what

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:03.840
and they are really pressed not maybe not that pressed in poland as they are in in in uh in your

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:12.800
country or in the west in general so this leads to unfortunately this leads to this something

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:21.760
that is better than nothing it leads to this something being of rather low both intellectual

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:29.760
as well as methodological piece of pseudo research yeah my second comment is the first one first

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:38.800
okay so so when I say something is better than nothing I meant in fact book reviews

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:48.720
write book reviews and write them for good journals so um because writing a book review

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.000
might not be what you originally would love to have which is a research paper but I would say

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.640
I would argue that that is the crucial first step right a couple of book reviews and after

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:10.720
that you will have acquired the skills to write research papers so don't run before you can walk

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:17.120
I would say although on this point I would also disagree with you you know I I can't

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:27.520
frankly speaking I can't somehow imagine a beginning phd student to write let's say a review of

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:34.640
of Derneis wrote on Derneis the psychology of language learner book review with well this little

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:44.800
experience in research very little experience in in in methodology in teaching in what really

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:53.920
the job is about the review okay the review might be a kind of review which you a student

01:09:53.920 --> 01:10:01.680
might be encouraged to present in his seminar or something but I would I would be very cautious to

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:11.680
advise this for him to publish this because I mean this is this is my yeah my my opinion okay I

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:20.560
agree with you that writing a really good book review is difficult but it is feasible for someone

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:27.840
who's starting a phd because it shows an ability to synthesize so they need to to say okay this

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:33.680
book has three parts it's a part about this it's a part about that it's a part about that

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:40.160
so so that is not too difficult right if you are if you have a masters you can do this and

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.920
the final part then you don't need to have huge research experience to say that you really enjoyed

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.240
this and that that that you you you felt the author could have said more on that and that

01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:01.520
and and so you you don't say anything obviously wrong or anyway the reviews editor would say well

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:06.240
you know you're a bit too negative or maybe you're a bit too positive or maybe you should do a bit of

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:15.120
that so you get some feedback but it's not too hard to produce a book review if you don't have too

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.760
much research experience but of course I mean we could discuss this further over a glass of beer

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:26.560
it's a huge topic but I would like to comment here too so my case my story is a bit different

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:34.000
and I think there are quite a few people like me who did their phd not as young people but in my case

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.440
after about 20 years of teaching experience and for me conceptualizing a topic in my case

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.240
how to facilitate self-regulated learning in a foreign language classroom

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:55.040
was a kind of literature review I did not use any data and I also did that like some other reviews

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.120
first because I was at the very early stage of my career and second we had a covid pandemic

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:09.120
so there was a limited opportunity to produce any sort of research so I just published to publish

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.960
something I'm not fully happy with the publication because there is also this thing that you know

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:21.440
year after year you become more critical of your own work which I think is quite natural

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:27.200
but I think it's not wasted effort so I had to think I had to conceptualize it

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.760
it had a revolving theme and it also gave me an opportunity to grow

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.920
mm-hmm so I'd say there is there is some positive thing about writing reviews

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:42.240
yeah

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.600
yeah we have one more comment one more comment and question from Dr Rusevich go on

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:59.440
so my my second point is about the neglect of affect so I don't think that affect has been I'll

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.200
just read through this has been neglected in second language acquisition at least not from

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:11.280
crashans affective filter theory I think that the problem with the affective factors is not that

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:19.440
the effects are unobservable as you said but that they are difficult to operationalize and tease out

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.800
from the intricate interplay of the whole array of emotional influences that are at play in second

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:32.880
language acquisition consequently the relative difficulty of identifying the affective effects

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:39.840
in second language acquisition following the difficulty in their operationalization leads

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:46.240
an ever-increasing number of young scholars to fall victim to some pre scientific and

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:53.040
straightforwardly bogus ideas which have been flying around for decades in second language

01:13:53.040 --> 01:14:03.440
acquisition and particularly in teacher training okay and here I mean ideas like multiple intelligences

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.640
for example flow by jigs and mihi okay matching learning styles with instruction

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:24.880
nlp neuro uh neuro didactics uh the the pre preoccupation with totally unresearchable

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:34.960
ideas unoperationalizable ideas like boredom and so on and this simply takes the whole attention

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:41.840
of the real factors involved in second language acquisition which are researchable

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:50.720
to those on which scholars can sort of float without really doing anything serious in that

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:59.440
matter this is my comment Jean-Marc okay you know I've been always I've been always critical of

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:08.560
this kind of things okay uh what do you say about that I my my reaction is don't throw the baby out

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:19.120
with the bathwater that yes of course there are things that are over the top in in second language

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:26.160
acquisition research as in any area of research and that you need to discern what what is useful

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:33.360
and what isn't I mean that that's your responsibility as a researcher I kind of smile

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:39.360
because you don't like flow and I just inserted a reference to a paper that came out in a plot

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:48.320
linguistics earlier this week on flow and I talked about it in my session I don't think flow is

01:15:49.200 --> 01:16:01.520
um a useless concept I think it's a very very interesting concept now the thing is

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:10.560
it's a metaphor this is a metaphor well no it describes something but sometimes you can

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.800
describe things that aren't necessarily always directly measurable in the sense that we

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.440
although in fact in the paper we do refer to neuro research that shows that specific areas

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:30.000
of the brain are in fact more heavily involved when people reach a flow state so this is not

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:36.800
esoteric stuff this is based on on solid science

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:48.400
the answer to the interesting affect in fact in a 2019 paper published in the modern language

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:56.800
journal I checked how often the word emotion and affect had been used in the modern language

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:07.840
journal on average and it turned out that before 2010 it was like an average of 8.5 times

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:20.320
a year that that word had been used after 2010 it went up sharply it went I think to 25 times

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:26.480
also before 2010 whenever there was talk of affect or emotion it was anxiety

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:35.280
after 2010 that that range increased so there is definitely increased interest

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:46.400
in in emotion and I totally agree with you that we need to avoid bogus ideas and there are bogus

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:54.160
ideas you know things like the lizard brain and and and stuff but we we think we I think we need to

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:09.920
be both critical but also courageous in trying to do solid research in areas where other people

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:19.040
may have had doubts so can you address the doubts can you convince them that this is solid

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.480
that you can actually measure this that people will agree with you

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:27.600
can you get your stuff published in the top journals if you can that's a kind of a validation

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:34.960
that flow is not just a bogus idea thanks I enjoyed I enjoyed your lecture

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:41.840
so hopefully we'll see each other in Sturck again I'm looking forward to that okay

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:49.680
right thank you very much both of you I think slowly time comes for a bit of round up

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:59.520
so I'm going to rely on my nose I really liked this metaphor I don't know how it is with you

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:06.400
guys but metaphors work with me so I like being able to hold into a metaphor and I really like

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.840
this one about the grain of sounds which you add to the pyramid of knowledge so we actually

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:18.640
build something huge and then when I was working with my boss professor Vishniewska on a very recent

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:25.520
paper I used another one which is in a way similar that's because that was about self-regulation

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:32.320
in the use of linguistic landscape and self-regulation is in general about being able to

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:41.440
use endless opportunities to learn worldwide and you spot the world as the endless stock of

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:47.360
knowledge and the first and most basic form of self-regulation is choosing the opportunity

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.880
you want to learn from so I think a lot of people are attending these lectures and I'm looking at

01:19:52.880 --> 01:20:02.080
the people in the hall but also are relating to the people online have used this opportunity a lot

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:07.280
and I think it was a very wise choice using the opportunity of having Jean-Marc with us

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:14.400
I would also like to say that okay my boss has already mentioned one conference in 2025

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:22.400
uh to which she has invited Jean-Marc as a plenary speaker and we'll be honored

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:30.000
indeed if he appears but there is another one so I can officially say that we as a the Institute

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.920
of Applied Linguistics are going to apply for the organization of the Psychology and Language

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:42.960
Learning and Teaching Conference 2026 so we're going to go for the organization and hopefully

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.640
we can also meet here for that conference before that I'm pretty sure we're going to see each other

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:58.000
in Madrid in May so there will be time to talk about that too to round up thank you very much

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.800
for your for all your talks very inspirational and thank you very much indeed for being with us

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:14.640
and looking forward to seeing you again Jean-Marc thank you thank you very much it was a pleasure

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:23.600
talking to you all and I wish you all well in your academic careers and yeah it was a bit strange to

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:31.200
be only online but I'm looking forward to being in Poznan again at some point all right thank you

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:37.760
very much indeed and looking forward to seeing you here in the future in person thank you and

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:49.040
hello Camilla good to see you in person yeah thank you thank you so much thank you bye okay bye bye
