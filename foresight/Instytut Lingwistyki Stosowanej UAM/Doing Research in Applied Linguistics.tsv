0	12000	Final presentation of mine. I thought that after talking to you about specific research
12000	21440	topics that I've been interested in, that it might be interesting to talk about a more
21440	27200	general topic which is doing research in applied linguistics. And of course it's my personal
27280	34240	view because anyone who does research in applied linguistics at whatever level, whether that is
34240	44640	your BA research project or your MA dissertation or your PhD or any project beyond the PhD,
45360	55520	everybody is facing similar issues and of course the expectations change slightly as you progress
55600	67520	through your career. I would start by talk about some, I would say almost philosophical issues
67520	78640	about research and one of the things that always struck me was that students tend to have,
79520	90560	tend to believe in predeterminism. They see these libraries full of books and these journals full
90560	99440	of papers and they can see the publication lists of certain researchers and it's easy to think
99440	112800	that this was destined to happen and so that it was driven by God, faith or some unknown force
113920	124880	so they tend to underestimate the fact that in fact nothing is predetermined. If you're a researcher
124880	131840	you could go in a thousand different directions, you could ask a thousand different questions and
131840	140080	you have a choice between a huge amount of methods and so nothing of what actually is produced
140720	148960	is predetermined. It's the result of free choice, free spirits trying to do something
148960	156880	that they are interested in and so I would say that it's crucial to hence realize that
157760	165360	Lambert, Garner, Dornier to mention three of the biggest names in motivation research and second
165360	172800	language acquisition that they weren't destined to introduce motivation and I had a chat with
172800	181040	Garner and Dornier and they were kind of surprised to a certain degree by the fact that their papers
181040	188320	seemed to have so much impact. They hadn't necessarily anticipated it. They were also
188320	194880	interested in other things but it was motivation that made their name and so I quite like the little
195440	204240	picture there about the PhD. If you're standing at the door deciding what to do for your PhD
204240	210800	it may look like a maze and I totally agree and I think that in fact the first year of doing the
210800	219360	PhD is getting lost in the maze and getting a sense of just how big the maze is and wander around
219360	228480	without necessarily finding the exit straight away. So this research does not descend from heaven
229120	236960	that's really an absolutely crucial point so it's not like Moses coming down the mountain
236960	243760	with God's words. It's really the result of inspiration, hard work, sweat and resilience.
244560	252160	Resilience because things typically don't go right straight away and in fact any paper that
252160	259520	you see published in a journal typically has been rejected one or twice, has been rewritten
259520	270880	about 10 or 15 times and the amount of work that the authors put into it is hard to imagine when
270880	279600	you see a nice neat little text that looks like a perfect finished product. Also it's important
279600	287280	to realize that the peer review system is valuable meaning that not all good papers submitted to
287280	296480	journals will get to publication because reviewers or editors may think it's not a good fit with the
296480	305200	journal or the reviewers may not like this type of research or reviewers may have different opinions
305200	313120	about what is important and what is original. So it's important to realize that if you submit
313120	321680	something to a journal and it's rejected never take it personally. It doesn't mean that you are
321680	329360	therefore a bad researcher. Absolutely not. You have to develop resilience and you have to extract
330960	339600	useful information from the rejection letter. What is it that they didn't like? Why? Can you
339600	347040	address it? If you can't address it you know sometimes it's better to throw away a paper that
347040	355760	has some fundamental deficit. If you can adapt it and submit it somewhere else please do and sometimes
355760	364640	good papers can get rejected because they challenge orthodoxy. So I remember talking to
364800	378080	prominent researchers who Albert Costa, the late Catalan psycholinguist who was complaining that
378080	385840	journal editors want in fact more of the same with small variations. So you add one little
385840	391920	ingredient and you repeat what you have done before because they know that that's a product
392880	404800	that will sell, that will be appreciated and he was angry that journals rejected the new papers he
404800	412400	was writing on the foreign language effect and that they wanted more of the old stuff. So I guess
412400	420880	that researchers sometimes face the kind of issue that artists have or singers in that the public
420960	430480	wants the good old tunes, the big hits and they don't necessarily want to hear the
431840	441520	singers' latest creations. Of course if I say that papers don't descend from heaven it doesn't mean
442400	452480	that new theories appear out of nothing. So if you work on certain topics it's because other
452480	460160	people have preceded you in working on that topic that teachers have told you about a certain topic
460160	466720	or certain research questions so the ground was prepared and at that point you come in and you
466720	473920	think okay what could I do to turn this into something original? Could I ask a question that
473920	482160	hasn't been asked before and sometimes you do manage to do that and you end up reshaping the
482160	490400	trajectory of a discipline. Now this is a nice little conceptualization of doing research where
490400	498800	you collect data, you sort it, you arrange it, you present it visually and you explain it with
498800	510880	a story and I would say that the crucial final step really is the explaining with a story meaning
510880	518640	that I desk reject quite a lot of papers submitted to my Journal of Multilingual Multicultural
518640	525920	Development because the authors have been through the first four stages so they did collect data,
525920	534880	they sorted it, they arranged it and they did some visual representation however they did not
534880	543440	come up with a good story and any research paper, any dissertation, any project really,
543680	553600	if there is no good story then in fact it's a failure because what the reader is interested in
553600	561040	or the audience is interested in is a good story that is based on solid data that has
561040	566640	been properly sorted that has been arranged following the conventions of the discipline
566720	575440	and that have been presented visually in order to understand or make a point and then this needs to
575440	582640	be embedded in a good story and the thing is it doesn't really matter what the story is about
583200	594000	but it needs to be a good story. Now if you are an academic or you are a PhD researcher
594640	604160	you may have heard about the sentence you know publish or perish and so this is a nice book by
604160	611840	James Hines, it's a funny book really about a young academic, a young American academic
611840	621200	who faces that terrible pressure to publish in order not to perish and so I think this is an
621280	627680	important point because once you enter academia and you become a researcher you do realise that
627680	635680	there is a huge amount of pressure on you to do so many things, you have to you know first you
635680	641280	finish your PhD and then you have to do so much teaching and you have to do administration and
641280	646720	you're expected to come up with creative ideas and publish them in the best journals and then
646720	651600	you spend so much time writing these papers and then they get rejected and then you realise
651600	656800	and then you hear from your head of department that if you don't have five publications by
656800	662560	the end of the year we will not prolong your contract so you are under a considerable amount
662560	669440	of stress and too much stress risks killing creativity because you end up not sleeping
669440	677840	enough and not going for walks and not allow your brain to engage in the kind of deep thinking that
677840	683440	you can get when I don't know you go walking in the forest and you're looking at a lake and that's
683440	690480	where an idea might hit you so you need to create the conditions where you can be creative
691600	697360	and of course publications matter, the career really depends on the publication list
698160	711680	so when I was in selection committees at Bergbeck the threshold to be invited to an interview
711680	718960	for a lectureship would typically be about five papers and maybe a couple of book reviews
719360	732240	that would be the kind of standard entry to get invited and you need these few publications to
733600	739760	convince the potential employer that you have research potential. I also think that it's better
739760	745760	to have something than nothing so it means that at the very start of your career it's okay if you
745760	757120	have some publications in conference proceedings that's fine I always recommend it to my students
757120	763680	also to write some book reviews because that's a useful way to find your academic voice and have a
764480	774480	line on your CV avoid publishing crap meaning if you realize that what you have produced
774480	779680	isn't very good and you get advice from your supervisor telling you you know that that's not
779680	789360	really good material then avoid publishing it so I guess that as if you want to become a researcher
789360	795760	you need a strategic plan knowing what to publish where at what pace and with whom.
796480	805040	So how to get published I would say it really depends on your research interests and on your
805040	814480	field so you need to know within that field what topics are hot. It's pretty easy if you go to a
814480	821680	conference or you look at the conference program of a recent conference you know you you check
822640	833920	what topics are being discussed and what seems to be creating buzz because you don't want to
834720	840800	start working and trying to publish something on a topic that is considered that is no longer
840800	846560	considered cool or hot it needs to be something that people are currently interested in because
846560	854720	that's what will hand you a job at the point so it's important also to create a network of people
855840	864560	who have similar interests so go to conferences try to talk to the plenary speakers during
864560	871040	coffee breaks or during the conference dinner contact authors if there is a paper out that
871040	876480	you're interested in but you can't access it if you flatter them a little bit they will typically
876880	885040	send you the pdf also keep an eye out on calls for papers of conferences or special issues or
885040	892560	answer books on the topic that you are interested in so what to publish it could be a small research
892560	900720	project pilot studies I recommend where all my PhD students I have recommended that they try to
901600	909920	turn the most interesting findings of their MA thesis or dissertation into a little publication
911120	917600	you could also publish a critical review of literature on a topic and plenty of journals
917600	925760	that are interested in critical reviews you could write some critical analysis of a popular concept
925840	933360	or contribute to a discussion forum and and as I said before book reviews are really a good way
933360	942080	to get free books and these books are typically very expensive so what is you simply contact
942080	951280	the reviews editor of a journal tell him or her that you are a PhD student or a master student
951280	957760	with a huge interest in this topic and that you notice that this expensive new book came out and
957760	964640	that you would love to review it for the journal and that typically implies writing 2000 writing
964640	972000	2000 words where you point out what you liked and what you didn't like much about the book
972880	979440	don't be too harsh because the author of that book may be your future employer so you need to be
980240	987440	careful and then the book reviews editor will contact the editor and will send you a free copy
987440	994080	of the book and you typically have three months to write your book review then the other one is the
994080	1000640	standard research paper typically between six and twelve thousand words there are also journals
1000640	1007040	that have options for shorter papers research in progress so that's typically somewhere between
1007040	1013840	three thousand and four thousand words and then there are also review papers where you write a review
1013840	1024720	of a particular area in the field um oh so before writing I would say that you need to come up you
1024720	1031520	need to develop an intuition or a gut feeling that something is original and is worth investigating
1031520	1038480	and that you happen to be the best person to do it and it's an intuition that you can typically
1038480	1045840	discuss with your supervisor because as supervisors we are very happy when students come up with
1045840	1055440	original ideas and I have published many papers with former bachelor students or master students
1055440	1062800	who came up with a really interesting idea and I thought oh yeah great let me supervise you properly
1062800	1070080	and let's make sure that we get good data and then they got a good grade for their BA or master
1070080	1077360	dissertation but of course these BA and master dissertations even if they have high grades they
1077360	1085760	are not necessarily publishable to turn a dissertation into a paper requires a lot of a lot of work so
1086320	1095360	we then turned it into papers and they got published so you need to formalize the intuition you need
1095360	1105600	to come up with a research design you need to develop a hypothesis based on previous literature
1105600	1111440	on previous research so you need a proper literature review then you collect the data
1112400	1120320	you as I said before you sort it you analyze it you see to what extent it confirms or disconfirms
1120320	1126320	previous research and what you do is really adding a grain of sand to the pyramid of knowledge
1126720	1129680	so I say that because
1132880	1139360	we shouldn't be over ambitious in the sense that the paper doesn't need to be revolutionary it
1139360	1147040	doesn't need to be the the 10 commandments that Moses came down with from his mountain
1147600	1152720	it just needs to be one gleaming beautiful perfectly
1155680	1161200	formed grain of sand and you add that to the pyramid of knowledge and you will have done your job
1162480	1167280	so it's good to assemble the data all the data before you start writing the paper
1168400	1176320	and I would say that when you write you write up the data do it as if you were talking to colleagues
1178000	1184160	then another question is whether you should go for co-authored or signal publications
1185120	1192240	I would say that it depends on the field in literature research most papers are signal authored
1192880	1200480	in social sciences in applied linguistics it's more common to see co-authored papers typically
1201280	1209040	between two and five authors if you look at physics for example or exact sciences stem
1209760	1215120	research you sometimes see a list of 10 authors because they are all the members of the lab
1215680	1226080	so that is rather unusual in applied linguistics it can be a great idea to co-author something
1226160	1233600	with somebody who has more experience than you because they know the ropes and they know how to
1233600	1243120	react to sharp comments by reviewers and they they know that if a reviewer recommends something
1243120	1248560	that you disagree with that you have the right to disagree and explain why you disagree and why
1248560	1255760	you will not follow the reviewer's recommendation and you may even have to appeal to the editor
1255760	1260880	saying you know reviewer three is asking me to drop this but I really think this is crucial
1261600	1270080	for this and this and this reason and so it's important to learn the practices in
1271840	1279520	publishing in applied linguistics I like co-authoring because I like working with people who have
1279520	1288320	skills that I don't have to the same extent for example I've been working with in Luis Botez
1288320	1296160	and Chen Chen Li who have amazing statistical skills there so they are psychometric specialists
1296160	1302000	so they can do things with stats that I couldn't do because I'm more self-taught
1302960	1313280	statistician and and it's great and then I help them write a good story and find some
1313280	1321600	interesting metaphors so finding the right journal that's a crucial and difficult question
1322880	1327040	do you go for the top journal or do you go for a lower ranked journal
1328000	1334960	and do you go for quantity or quality and my recommendation would be to aim for balance
1334960	1340240	where you have some quick intimate I wouldn't say low level in fact but more intermediate level
1341120	1347520	publications like conference proceedings web-based journals and then I would recommend
1347520	1355600	spending a lot of time and energy to try and get at least one paper into a really prestigious journal
1355680	1364560	because future selection committees will look at UCV and will say okay some conference proceedings
1364560	1373600	some mid-level journals but wow one paper in a really good journal and if you can do one then
1373600	1381600	the assumption is that you can do more so I would also say recommend that you send your best work
1381600	1388160	to the best journals so check whether the impact factor is high whether you know the people who
1388160	1396080	publish in that journal again ask advice to supervisors I would absolutely avoid non-referee
1396080	1406160	journals unless it's reviews or opinion pieces also avoid edited volumes with editors that don't
1406160	1417440	have a name in the field or working with co-authors that you don't trust much or you don't have much
1417440	1428160	of a reputation unless they are your students and avoid also volumes published by publishers that are
1428160	1436800	so-called pirate publishers there are a number of them and you need absolutely to avoid
1437440	1443520	publishing there so again that's something that you need to ask your supervisor and then the other
1443520	1449760	thing is that you probably need to avoid editors that work slowly because if you're at the start of
1449760	1454400	your career you don't want to wait two or three years for a chapter to come out
1455200	1465680	so as I said avoid predatory journal open access these days is becoming more
1467040	1478400	common institutions typically pay the to have the paper out in open access but you need to avoid
1478400	1490320	these so-called predatory journals so be extremely careful they typically contact you after you
1490320	1497760	presented something at the conference something that leaves a trace on the internet and then
1497760	1506320	they will you will get an invitation saying you know we we noticed that you produced this
1506320	1514400	magnificent or that you presented this magnificent paper we we think you are brilliant now will you
1514400	1523120	please submit your paper in our journal run away delete straight away because if somebody flatters
1523120	1534000	you it's probably a scam so because then there will be hidden payments the quality will be crap
1534720	1544000	and it risks in fact undermining your academic credibility so make sure you check
1544560	1551440	where you submit your paper now what to avoid in the paper and I'm saying this because as editor
1552080	1560880	I come across about 800 papers a year submitted to my journal and and I would typically reject
1560880	1570080	the ones that have very superficial literature reviews where there is just some reference
1570080	1576320	dropping but there isn't any critical engagement with the studies presented
1578240	1584560	also avoid claiming that very little research has been done in an area if you're not 100
1584560	1590960	percent sure and it's hard to be 100 percent sure because you can't know everything that has
1590960	1598400	been published and and it could be the reviewer reading your paper who happened to have produced
1598400	1604800	some research in that topic and he or she will be angry with you for claiming that very little
1604800	1612720	has been done also crucial to make sure that the text looks good sloppiness is dangerous
1613520	1618880	so make sure you stick to the style sheet of the journal that the references are in the right
1618880	1624560	format double check whether everything in the list of references is mentioned in the text and vice
1624560	1635200	versa make sure the spelling of surnames is correct because it really pisses a reviewer
1635200	1643600	of if his or her surname is badly spelled also avoid making sweeping generalizations
1643600	1653120	so always be very careful in discussing the the the results because what applies to
1653920	1662400	your particular data set might not apply to data sets collected from different participants
1662400	1669360	in different environments also avoid claims that cannot be substantiated and avoid a rhetorical
1669360	1674560	style that does not match that of the journal I would add to that avoid
1677200	1684640	taking sides in whatever argument you are presenting so you are writing an impartial
1684960	1692560	paper you are writing a paper on a topic you cannot choose a position so if you're not writing a
1692560	1699280	pamphlet to attack something or to defend something you are looking at with an impartial
1700560	1708000	pair of eyes and you may come to a conclusion that this is more correct than that or that you
1708640	1717920	prefer this to that but the paper cannot be written like it would be a pamphlet
1719680	1726320	so to get your paper accepted it's crucial to keep it simple so the story needs to be
1726880	1733520	a specific story on one specific theme so better to explain one idea in detail than too many
1733600	1741520	superficially and I would say that is a typical beginner's mistake beginner researcher want to
1741520	1751440	cram in too many ideas so my golden rule is less is more so the one idea needs to be
1752480	1760080	visible in the title must come clearly through in the abstract in the opening of the introduction
1760080	1767040	and again in the conclusion so people get it what the idea was so also follow the style and
1767040	1772960	the structure of papers published in the journal that you have in mind and if you think oh this is
1772960	1781760	also such a good idea I could also put it in there in fact my advice is split it off cut and paste
1781760	1789760	it in a separate document something that you can develop later try not to put too many eggs
1790000	1796400	in the one basket also think hard about the title when you finish the paper because sometimes you
1796400	1802480	start with a working title and then at the very end of the paper finishing the paper you realize
1802480	1808400	that in fact you need to revisit the title because the the the idea may have shifted a little bit
1808400	1815280	you may have focused on one aspect rather than what you announced in the title and and the title
1815280	1823280	really will determine whether or not your paper is cited if it's too long too clunky
1825280	1832640	it won't get much attention so also having a catchy title is good but don't there is no need to
1832640	1838880	have a catchy title but if you can come up with something catchy that that gets people's attention
1838880	1846000	that would certainly help so writing tips I would say writing a good introduction
1846000	1852400	in fact the first sentence is crucial if you don't catch the attention of the reader
1853520	1858480	and you don't convey the importance of the questions addressed in in that first sentence in
1858480	1865200	that first paragraph nobody is going to read the rest of the text so I would say that I
1865200	1871440	just reject again paper submitted to my journal if I read the introduction well I read the abstract
1871440	1877760	and I read the introduction and if halfway through the introduction I still don't know what this
1877760	1884720	paper is about I reject it because they didn't catch my attention so text can be written in
1884720	1890560	the past or present tense past tense okay if you describe results of an experiment but typically
1890560	1899840	present tense if it's a general conclusion good to write if you write in English you need to write
1899840	1906640	short sentences shorter than you would if you were writing in French or Italian for example
1908240	1917440	also avoid fluffy hermetic and complex ways of saying a simple thing so I would say that the
1917520	1926400	Anglo-Saxon requirement is really to not beat around the bush be as clear and as simple as possible
1927920	1933040	now I want to talk to you about something I find really interesting which is
1933920	1939840	comes from chaos theory and the dynamic systems theory which is the butterfly effect
1940400	1949920	namely the fact that a new idea at some point in time may feel like nothing more than the flapping
1949920	1958480	of wings and I don't know whether you know this metaphor of the butterfly effect it's the flapping
1958480	1971120	of the wings of a butterfly today in Poznan may be linked to a storm in Italy in two weeks because
1972240	1980800	it could have unexpected consequences and because the world is a dynamic system
1980960	1988560	you don't know exactly what the consequences will be in our case of a particular paper
1989120	1995760	so sometimes a paper gets published and doesn't get cited very much for a couple of years and
1995760	2002560	then suddenly there is growing interest in the area and suddenly that paper may get started to
2002800	2009440	be cited more and more and you could say that you could say that that paper was in fact
2010000	2019280	the butterfly and that it had unexpected consequences or effects on the field
2019920	2026880	and so butterflies you could refer to butterflies by famous researchers like Galileo
2026880	2037200	when he first published his rejection of the geocentric model saying that you know the earth
2037200	2048160	circulates around the the sun very few people believed him and the church was very angry
2048160	2053200	and with him for making that claim and in the end it turned out that he was right
2054160	2062320	same with Einstein who introduced relativity again something that not many people believed
2062320	2069760	could be true when it was first published and then became the dominant paradigm in physics
2069760	2080240	and then I would also say that sometimes the butterflies can be political and I'm thinking
2080240	2088320	here about Tarek el Tayev Mohammed Bouazzi who was a modest street vendor and he set himself
2088320	2096560	on fire in 2010 in Tunisia and it was an act that led to the Tunisian revolution so the poor man was
2096560	2109200	desperate and wanted to express his protest in that act of self-immolation and that had consequences
2109760	2118480	so he was a kind of a butterfly now another thing that I'm interested in is how
2120000	2126800	research develops within sciences and how it develops within applied linguistics
2126800	2133520	and how that development is typically non-linear and I recommend the book by Thomas Kuhn on the
2133520	2141840	structure of scientific revolutions so where he explains that science goes through paradigm shifts
2142800	2148320	where current theories can't explain some phenomenon someone proposes a new theory
2148320	2160480	so I would say that when Galileo came in he pointed out that the the observations did not
2160480	2171440	allow him to confirm the theory that earth was the center of the universe so more and more
2171440	2180000	observations led to the rejection of the old geocentric model and the introduction of the new
2180800	2189120	heliocentric model so that was a typical paradigm shift so this revolution occurs when the new
2189200	2196160	paradigm is better at explaining the observations offers a model that is closer to the objective
2196160	2205280	external reality and that the new paradigm is incommensurate with the old one so examples of
2205280	2213200	paradigm shifts in applied linguistics if you are a master student in applied linguistics you know
2213200	2222560	that it was behaviorism that it ended in fact when Chomsky in 1959 reviewed Skinner's verbal
2222560	2232240	behavior and where Chomsky said in fact language is not a collection of reinforced habits as the
2232240	2241120	behaviorists claimed children use language creatively so it was a kind it was the death
2241120	2251680	now for behaviorism in applied linguistics at the time also we have had a contrastive analysis
2252240	2259280	that was also inspired by behaviorism seeing language as a set of habits with second language
2259280	2265840	acquisition being the establishment of new habits where it was assumed that if there were errors in
2265840	2273200	the second language they were caused by the first language and the prediction that the
2273200	2278080	bigger the difference between a structure in the first and the second language the more errors
2278080	2285920	would occur in the second language and then Zobel was among those who pointed out that
2285920	2291280	French learners of English failed to show evidence of the predictor error but English learners of
2291280	2300160	French did so in French for those of you who know French you can say je les vois in English you
2300160	2307600	would have to put the object pronoun after the verb so you would say I see them however looking at
2307600	2315040	learner data Zobel realized that French learners of English never said things like I them see
2316000	2323280	which would be the expected pattern because then they would transfer their French syntactic pattern
2323280	2333120	yet English learners of French did produce sentences like je vois et instead of je la vois
2333120	2341040	so the interference didn't go in both directions so the transfer of habits was not consistent across
2341120	2351120	languages okay so that was until now the the general advice about doing research
2352160	2358800	in applied linguistics and about the butterfly effects and I would say that in a certain sense
2359360	2368880	we all have experienced butterfly effects meaning that we have all done certain things
2368880	2376800	that led us on to certain paths and that we could not have predicted where they would take us so
2376800	2384240	when I started my career and so I will talk about these butterfly effects and and these trigger
2384240	2393120	events in in my own career and I started doing a masters in French in Brussels and I did my
2393760	2402480	master's dissertation on a theoretical topic namely a famous French linguist called Gustave
2402480	2412480	Guillaume and I managed to publish the findings of that dissertation in Travaux de Languistique
2413440	2423440	and I was really into theoretical French linguistics at the time but then my once I
2423440	2428880	started doing my PhD it was a PhD in applied linguistics on the acquisition of French as
2428880	2435840	a foreign language and I kind of abandoned theoretical linguistics and became more interested
2435840	2442160	in applied linguistics and so my first applied linguistic paper appeared in 92 was on the omission
2442240	2449920	of Neu in French interlanguage so that was in fact a combination of social linguistics and
2449920	2457760	applied linguistics and then I published my first papers in French then realized that I would probably
2459120	2465040	reach a wider audience if I wrote the papers in English but my English wasn't that good so I had
2465040	2476880	to ask a friend to help me out and so by 2000 I was writing in English and I was interested there
2477520	2483360	also in gender assignment and gender agreement in advanced French interlanguage that was
2483360	2493120	part of my PhD dissertation and I also became interested in the use of colloquial words and
2493200	2498800	emotional words and swear words in advanced French interlanguage so I was still very much
2499360	2506400	focused on French as a second language at the start of my career and then I had
2508160	2514960	critical incidents so I encountered my colleagues when I joined Bergbeck in 1994
2515680	2524240	I realized that I had gaps in my social pragmatic competence in English I was able to understand
2526560	2531760	I was able to understand most of what my colleagues said but I didn't always understand what they
2531760	2539040	actually meant so I understood the words but I didn't always get what their emotions were
2539200	2545680	and what they really meant so I couldn't really read between the stiff upper lips of my colleague
2546480	2557360	and then I had a chat with an aunt of mine who worked in palliative care and ELSE is her name
2557360	2564000	and she asked me so what do you do I said oh well you know I teach at the university and I do research
2564000	2573280	and I had just published it was the conversation happened in to early 2001 and I said you know and
2573280	2583520	I have had just this paper out on how learners of French agree gender sometimes and sometimes they
2583520	2589120	don't and isn't that fascinating and and she looked at me and she said so you are really splitting
2589120	2597520	hairs and I thought oh that's not very kind but I laughed and I said well I guess so yeah but you
2597520	2604960	know it's my hobby and I get paid to do it but it felt a bit lame and then 9-11 happened and I felt
2604960	2611200	that suddenly as applied linguists there was an urgent need for us to promote peace tolerance of
2611200	2617920	diversity in fact the underlining the value of multilingualism and multiculturalism and
2618080	2622880	positive thinking and that it was our moral duty as applied linguists to do some good
2622880	2631360	for society that we needed to get out of our ivory towers and so I left the ivory tower and
2631360	2642640	met a huge amount of people and a few names there a picture there with Beverly Costa we got an award
2642640	2652880	for our work then bottom left is with Kasia Saito who's a great friend and then in the middle a picture
2652880	2661120	with Peter McIntyre, Tammy Gregerson and Elaine Horitz and Sarah Mercer who became lifelong friends
2661840	2670320	and to the right there holding the distinguished scholarship award from AAA L Annetta Pavlenko
2671040	2678960	surrounded by Peter De Costa and Lourdes Ortega so all these people became really good friends
2678960	2687200	and I realized that one of my early papers really had an impact we were among the first to introduce
2687200	2696880	the word emotion in applied linguistics and in a paper in 2002 and then Annetta and I realized
2696880	2702160	that the emotion was really an interesting topic that not much had been written about it
2702160	2708640	and that we could organize panels on emotions and multilingualism at different conferences
2708640	2714080	which is what we did in the early 2000s and then based on these panels we
2715840	2724000	guest edited special issues in different journals and so we attracted attention to the topic and
2724000	2735280	we invited colleagues to join us and then we developed a follow-up study we developed a
2735280	2741200	bilingualism and emotion questionnaire which was probably the first and the biggest online
2741200	2749040	questionnaire in applied linguistics it remained online for two years collected data from over 1500
2749040	2755520	multilinguals and those of you who listened to my first talk remember that it was about
2756160	2765040	language preferences to express emotions also information on proficiency on anxiety and we
2765040	2770400	found that the first language is typically preferred for communication of emotion and it's
2770400	2777120	typically felt to have most emotional resonance so once we had all those data we published papers
2777120	2783120	on that and then we realized that we both had to publish a book on it and that it would be
2783120	2789920	more helpful to each have a separate book rather than to have a co-author book so Annetta published
2789920	2802800	her book pretty soon in 2005 and then I published mine five years later with a slightly different
2802800	2813280	focus and so the mine was more had more statistics in it than Annetta and you I don't remember whether
2813280	2822640	I told you that the face the self-portrait on the cover of my book is in fact a painting that is
2822640	2830080	hanging here in my office it's the self-portrait by my maternal grandfather from 1933 and he was
2830080	2836640	a passionate bilingual so I thought right he's the perfect person and this is the perfect
2838640	2848800	cover for my book and then in 2005 I was also among the first to call for more attention to
2848800	2855200	psychological and emotional dimensions in second language acquisition research and again I didn't
2855200	2865920	know at the time that that paper would get cited quite a lot and then interesting emotion research
2865920	2872320	started to develop more gradually in applied linguistics it had been dominantly cognitive
2872320	2878960	until the time with the focus on observable and measurable units and I had this chat with John
2878960	2884400	Schumann who's one of the founders of applied linguistics and professor of applied linguistics
2884400	2896480	at UCLA in California and he said well you know it's about applied linguists wanting to make sure
2896480	2902960	that they are taken seriously that they do that they are real scientists so they use sophisticated
2902960	2913840	statistics so they can legitimately be considered as scientists and he said emotions are probably
2913840	2920080	less attractive because they have no observable physical reference in the world and they fell
2920080	2930880	outside of the traditional remit of second language acquisition so the winds of change started to come
2930880	2937520	with the introduction of more qualitative research in applied linguistics where it suddenly became
2937520	2944640	okay to look at the L2 learners subjective side that included emotion, investment, duty,
2944640	2953040	love, desire and I refer here to the work by Claire Kramsch and Anita Pavlenko and I think I also
2953920	2960560	reminded you during my first session about the metaphor about emotions being the elephant in
2960560	2966800	the room that everybody knows they are there but they are not really taken into consideration
2966800	2973600	because they are considered to be inferior to rational thought and hopefully this change now
2973600	2979920	with the prior saying that yeah there is an elephant but it's time to open the windows and
2979920	2988160	to move on and so we have had the so-called emotional term and also the effective term
2988320	3000240	in fact I guess applied linguists and authors love to coin a nice new collocation linked to
3000240	3005360	their name so emotional term effective term they are good collocation see it shows that
3005360	3012880	there suddenly is some kind of maybe not paradigm shift but mini paradigm shift
3013680	3023760	also I ran the ngram viewer to look at the use of the word emotion in written text since the
3023760	3034160	1800s and you see that there's been a sharp increase in the word emotion since the 1990s
3034160	3039600	really so I would say that my interest in emotional and applied linguistics in a sense
3039920	3047520	reflects an increased interest in that word and an increased use of that word
3048320	3054960	across different disciplines across different genres and styles so I guess there is more
3056960	3064880	publicity ads that play on our emotions today than they would have 40 years ago
3065840	3070720	also although there wasn't much about emotion in applied linguistics in fact there were
3070720	3078720	emotional journals in psychology and these three journals were all established late 20th century
3078720	3088960	early of our current century so you see that there was interest in emotion that it typically
3089040	3096720	started at that point but it took a little while before it came into applied linguistics and
3097920	3108640	the introduction in Dorne and Ryan in 2015 is telling in that the authors say that of course
3112240	3117600	the classic individual differences paradigm in applied linguistics barely acknowledges
3117600	3125760	the central role of emotions and feelings and emotions play a huge part in all our lives
3125760	3130800	they have been shunned to a large extent by both psychology and second language acquisition
3131440	3137840	literature so there is a general emotional deficit and they acknowledge
3138640	3146400	that the 2005 version of their book reflected this trend so it was an ongoing conversation
3146400	3154960	I had with Zoltan and with Steven Ryan that that emotion needed more attention and why
3154960	3160880	weren't they talking about emotion more and so I was pretty happy in 2015 when they acknowledged
3160880	3168640	that yes they should have talked more about emotion and then I also realized that of course
3169440	3177440	our research is spread over different fields that in the social psychological research tradition
3177440	3184480	motivation researchers typically had included anxiety dimensions but had never included
3184480	3189200	positive emotion dimensions if there were positive emotions there were typically item
3189200	3198400	level emotions like I like my English class but there wasn't a proper foreign language
3198480	3205600	enjoyment dimension for example and most research on emotions had focused on foreign language
3205600	3211520	classroom anxiety also looking at applied linguistics there is in fact only one journal
3212160	3218160	journal for the psychology of language learning that has the word psychology in the title and I
3218160	3222880	also added the journal of language and social psychology but that's in fact a psychological
3222880	3233520	paper so it's a social psychological journal I talked to you in my second session about
3234800	3241440	learner emotions and how the interest in learner emotions came after the introduction of positive
3241440	3249440	psychology in applied linguistics 2012 paper by Pete McIntyre and Gregerson and then a 2014
3250400	3256560	paper also by McIntyre and Mercer about what positive psychology could bring to second language
3256560	3266800	acquisition research it was followed by two edited books one edited in Poland by Danuta
3266800	3274240	Gampis Barker and her colleague Dagmara on positive psychology perspectives in foreign
3274320	3280640	language learning and teaching and also a book published by Multilingual Matters edited by
3280640	3288240	McIntyre Gregerson and Mercer on positive psychology in SNA and the publication of these two books
3288240	3297120	helped strengthen the growing interest in positive psychology in learner emotions and also later
3297120	3304720	in teacher emotions and then in my second session I presented the paper that I co-authored
3304720	3311760	with Peter McIntyre the Two Faces of Yanus where we presented the concept of foreign language
3311760	3325680	enjoyment it's been my most cited paper and then also with Chen Chen Li we published a paper in
3325680	3331840	a Chinese journal which I like because we shouldn't just publish in international
3334160	3342880	journals we should also publish in national journals where we talked about the four or
3342880	3350000	the three phases of emotions where they were first avoided because cognition was the only
3350000	3356880	thing that mattered then the second phase where there was interest in anxiety including the work
3356880	3365280	by crashing on his effective filter hypothesis and then Elena's horrid foreign language classroom
3365280	3372000	anxiety and the phase we are currently in which is a positive and negative emotions phase
3372000	3377120	thanks to the emotional turn and positive psychology where we've taken a more holistic
3377120	3384240	view on emotions and look at a variety of different emotions that learners and teachers
3384240	3393520	may experience so we conceptualized enjoyment as this complex and positive emotion that occurs
3393520	3400640	when people not just meet their needs but exceed them do something unexpected you may remember that
3400640	3408080	I cited the meta-analysis that showed that if you suffer from high anxiety in your classroom
3408080	3415360	you typically don't do as well whereas if you enjoy your foreign language classroom a lot
3415360	3421840	you are typically more willing to communicate and you typically will have better results so the
3421840	3429440	pedagogical implication of that is that teachers can create optimal positive atmosphere so part of
3429520	3439680	my research output has been the creation of new instruments and those turned out to be highly
3439680	3445680	cited although we didn't really do it to get high citation but if you develop a new instrument
3445680	3452960	to do further research on a certain topic they need to be solid and so you see I love collaborating
3452960	3461760	with Ilwis Bottes and Chen Chen Li to do this and then you know I don't want to read this out
3461760	3469680	obviously but we did a lot of work on the sources and the effects of enjoyment anxiety and boredom
3470800	3478560	how that is linked to teacher behavior how different positive personality traits are linked
3478560	3485120	to willingness to communicate and to performance how it's linked to trait emotional intelligence
3485920	3492160	we also looked at enjoyment in first language classes and discovered that it is that different
3492160	3499440	from foreign language classes and yeah and then more recently I did a couple of
3500640	3506960	studies on teacher emotions teachers who are forced to smile in front of a class when they
3506960	3515840	don't feel like smiling because they are tired or stressed and and also the the role of the teacher
3515840	3521680	in front of the class where through a process of emotional contagion a happy teacher can make the
3521680	3531040	whole classroom happy unhappy teacher can also contain you know in fact the everybody and where
3531040	3536800	everybody feels depressed so as a teacher you really need that emotional labor to keep a smile on
3536800	3544560	your face and on the face of your your students and then with Prihati Ergun we looked at the link
3544560	3550160	between well-being resilience and foreign language teaching enjoyment so that that's another
3550160	3560240	interesting concept so what what makes a teacher enjoy his or her teaching and and to what extent
3560240	3568640	is it linked to teacher internal variables like well-being and resilience and then I did a lot of
3568640	3578960	work thanks to a PhD student of mine on emotion recognition and so how do we recognize how a
3578960	3588720	multilingual feels when we watch or an audio when we watch a video recording or when we listen to an
3588720	3597760	audio recording and and this turns out to to to be an area of research that that really caught my
3597760	3604560	attention and and it was thanks to this PhD student Pernell Lorette and a number of other
3604560	3613360	lovely colleagues and then I think also in my first lecture that I mentioned how my interest in emotion
3613760	3623280	developed into the more specific context of multilingualism in psychotherapy
3623840	3632800	where we discovered that very often multilingual clients feel that their multilingualism and
3632800	3640240	multiculturalism is not sufficiently addressed in therapy and that there are also differences
3640240	3648560	between monolingual and multilingual therapists in how they deal with their with their clients and
3648560	3655840	that research won us a reward an award from the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy
3655840	3663600	so it was clear that we had been doing something original that had practical implications and
3663600	3669920	the practical implications we worked on them trying to raise awareness about multilingualism
3669920	3677680	and the issues that this implies for the psychotherapist and we published a couple of papers
3678320	3686560	on that topic also thanks to Beverly Costa we try to disseminate our findings to a larger audience
3687120	3695440	and Beverly Costa not only did she train about 3000 trainee therapists in a program called
3695440	3702640	Improving Access to Psychological Therapists in the UK training also a clinical supervisor
3702640	3712640	but she also had the brilliant idea to hire an established author to turn to
3714640	3724000	turn our research findings and her case notes into a play so Andrew Weir wrote the session
3725760	3736080	based on an original idea by Mother Tong and it's about a Polish woman married to a British man
3736080	3743200	and they have communication problems and he doesn't value her cultural background enough and
3745040	3753360	there is some trauma about the child and so it was performed at the Soho Theatre and about
3753360	3760800	3000 people came to see that play and so the play was really about the issues that we had
3760800	3768080	found in our research and that was a nice way to disseminate the findings also our research
3768080	3775280	had an impact in that the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapists clearly
3776240	3784000	added the importance of being aware of unconscious linguistic bias assumptions
3784000	3793040	and privilege if you work with multilingual clients the crucial need to offer linguistically
3793040	3798560	sensitive supervision acknowledging the role of language and identity development processing
3798560	3805360	of trauma memory recall and emotional expression so that was in fact clearly linked to the work
3806000	3812080	I had been doing with Beverly Costa and that applies to the UK but it implies in fact it
3812080	3818560	applies to other contexts also of course so to conclude I would say that research doesn't
3818560	3824640	emerge in a vacuum that emotion research emerged against the odds that was kind of inevitable
3825600	3830480	that intense academic socialization collaboration needs to join development and new ideas
3831360	3838240	I think it really helps to write in English to reach a wider audience I think it's also crucial
3838240	3844480	to talk to people from neighboring disciplines for cross-fertilization and that doing research is
3844480	3850560	just fantastic it's exhilarating intoxicating unpredictable and I would say that it is absolutely
3850560	3857440	worth the effort and because there were so many words I want to finish with some pictures so the
3857440	3863520	top left picture you will recognize the face of Zoltan Doge at the conference dinner in
3863520	3872400	grass in 2014 and beneath that is a Jew who is sitting on the floor during a triple AL conference
3872400	3881280	being in a packed room and being a bit tired and at the bottom left there I was at an emotion
3881280	3889040	conference with my then current PhD and former PhD students and then the other pictures again
3889840	3897520	walking going to conferences having dinners and top right is my friend Lee Wei giving a
3897520	3906240	plenary at conferences meaning what I'm saying here is that research happens because you are
3906240	3912480	collaborating with absolutely lovely people and if somebody turns out not to be lovely you just
3912480	3918240	drop them and you work with the ones that you appreciate and that keep their word and that
3918240	3925920	have the integrity and honesty and friendship and if they can bake banana breads when you
3925920	3931360	go to a conference and they give you a bit of banana bread that's even better that's a hint
3931360	3938960	because that's what Jakub did at the last euro slot conference so many thanks and I hope you will
3938960	3949680	have some questions for me encouraged by all means and the priority goes to the people in the room
3949680	3956000	you know that you can approach this place anytime you are not seen because the camera is off
3956000	3962160	so all you need is a bit of courage we had that happen before so if you think of asking a question
3962160	3966960	now is the perfect opportunity first of all the people in the hall
3967680	3981200	especially those people who are thinking of doing perhaps further research and applied linguistics
3984480	3987760	I can see that there is a question in the chat
3988720	3989040	all right
3993280	4002640	yes let me start with the first hello hello Joe Mark can you hear me okay go ahead yes
4005120	4006800	it's Jace Krisevich
4009520	4015600	I decided to to write you to write a question or rather not a question but a comment
4016560	4022240	so if you if you don't mind I will just I would just read the read those out so
4023040	4031040	I have two comments to make first of all I'd be cautious to take to advise young scholars
4031040	4039040	in the first half of your lecture here to better publish something than nothing
4040000	4045040	even though you immediately done played this with the recommendation not to publish crap
4046080	4053440	what I think is that unfortunately in in the majority of cases the urge and the pressure
4053440	4064240	on young people to to publish and the imperative to do so especially nowadays in what I call mass
4064320	4070160	university culture where we have dozens and dozens and dozens of phd students
4071040	4075680	taking interest in second language acquisition first language acquisition god knows what
4076960	4083840	and they are really pressed not maybe not that pressed in poland as they are in in in uh in your
4083840	4092800	country or in the west in general so this leads to unfortunately this leads to this something
4092800	4101760	that is better than nothing it leads to this something being of rather low both intellectual
4101760	4109760	as well as methodological piece of pseudo research yeah my second comment is the first one first
4110720	4118800	okay so so when I say something is better than nothing I meant in fact book reviews
4119040	4128720	write book reviews and write them for good journals so um because writing a book review
4129840	4136000	might not be what you originally would love to have which is a research paper but I would say
4136000	4142640	I would argue that that is the crucial first step right a couple of book reviews and after
4142640	4150720	that you will have acquired the skills to write research papers so don't run before you can walk
4150720	4157120	I would say although on this point I would also disagree with you you know I I can't
4158240	4167520	frankly speaking I can't somehow imagine a beginning phd student to write let's say a review of
4168080	4174640	of Derneis wrote on Derneis the psychology of language learner book review with well this little
4175920	4184800	experience in research very little experience in in in methodology in teaching in what really
4186080	4193920	the job is about the review okay the review might be a kind of review which you a student
4193920	4201680	might be encouraged to present in his seminar or something but I would I would be very cautious to
4201680	4211680	advise this for him to publish this because I mean this is this is my yeah my my opinion okay I
4211680	4220560	agree with you that writing a really good book review is difficult but it is feasible for someone
4220560	4227840	who's starting a phd because it shows an ability to synthesize so they need to to say okay this
4227840	4233680	book has three parts it's a part about this it's a part about that it's a part about that
4233680	4240160	so so that is not too difficult right if you are if you have a masters you can do this and
4241840	4247920	the final part then you don't need to have huge research experience to say that you really enjoyed
4248000	4254240	this and that that that you you you felt the author could have said more on that and that
4254240	4261520	and and so you you don't say anything obviously wrong or anyway the reviews editor would say well
4261520	4266240	you know you're a bit too negative or maybe you're a bit too positive or maybe you should do a bit of
4266240	4275120	that so you get some feedback but it's not too hard to produce a book review if you don't have too
4275120	4279760	much research experience but of course I mean we could discuss this further over a glass of beer
4280480	4286560	it's a huge topic but I would like to comment here too so my case my story is a bit different
4286560	4294000	and I think there are quite a few people like me who did their phd not as young people but in my case
4294000	4301440	after about 20 years of teaching experience and for me conceptualizing a topic in my case
4302160	4306240	how to facilitate self-regulated learning in a foreign language classroom
4306960	4315040	was a kind of literature review I did not use any data and I also did that like some other reviews
4315760	4321120	first because I was at the very early stage of my career and second we had a covid pandemic
4321120	4329120	so there was a limited opportunity to produce any sort of research so I just published to publish
4329200	4334960	something I'm not fully happy with the publication because there is also this thing that you know
4334960	4341440	year after year you become more critical of your own work which I think is quite natural
4341440	4347200	but I think it's not wasted effort so I had to think I had to conceptualize it
4348000	4353760	it had a revolving theme and it also gave me an opportunity to grow
4354640	4359920	mm-hmm so I'd say there is there is some positive thing about writing reviews
4362000	4362240	yeah
4364720	4369600	yeah we have one more comment one more comment and question from Dr Rusevich go on
4370800	4379440	so my my second point is about the neglect of affect so I don't think that affect has been I'll
4379440	4385200	just read through this has been neglected in second language acquisition at least not from
4385200	4391280	crashans affective filter theory I think that the problem with the affective factors is not that
4391280	4399440	the effects are unobservable as you said but that they are difficult to operationalize and tease out
4400080	4406800	from the intricate interplay of the whole array of emotional influences that are at play in second
4406800	4412880	language acquisition consequently the relative difficulty of identifying the affective effects
4413520	4419840	in second language acquisition following the difficulty in their operationalization leads
4419840	4426240	an ever-increasing number of young scholars to fall victim to some pre scientific and
4426240	4433040	straightforwardly bogus ideas which have been flying around for decades in second language
4433040	4443440	acquisition and particularly in teacher training okay and here I mean ideas like multiple intelligences
4443440	4450640	for example flow by jigs and mihi okay matching learning styles with instruction
4451600	4464880	nlp neuro uh neuro didactics uh the the pre preoccupation with totally unresearchable
4464880	4474960	ideas unoperationalizable ideas like boredom and so on and this simply takes the whole attention
4474960	4481840	of the real factors involved in second language acquisition which are researchable
4481840	4490720	to those on which scholars can sort of float without really doing anything serious in that
4491520	4499440	matter this is my comment Jean-Marc okay you know I've been always I've been always critical of
4499440	4508560	this kind of things okay uh what do you say about that I my my reaction is don't throw the baby out
4508560	4519120	with the bathwater that yes of course there are things that are over the top in in second language
4519120	4526160	acquisition research as in any area of research and that you need to discern what what is useful
4526160	4533360	and what isn't I mean that that's your responsibility as a researcher I kind of smile
4533360	4539360	because you don't like flow and I just inserted a reference to a paper that came out in a plot
4539360	4548320	linguistics earlier this week on flow and I talked about it in my session I don't think flow is
4549200	4561520	um a useless concept I think it's a very very interesting concept now the thing is
4562720	4570560	it's a metaphor this is a metaphor well no it describes something but sometimes you can
4570560	4576800	describe things that aren't necessarily always directly measurable in the sense that we
4577760	4583440	although in fact in the paper we do refer to neuro research that shows that specific areas
4583440	4590000	of the brain are in fact more heavily involved when people reach a flow state so this is not
4592560	4596800	esoteric stuff this is based on on solid science
4597760	4608400	the answer to the interesting affect in fact in a 2019 paper published in the modern language
4608400	4616800	journal I checked how often the word emotion and affect had been used in the modern language
4616800	4627840	journal on average and it turned out that before 2010 it was like an average of 8.5 times
4630640	4640320	a year that that word had been used after 2010 it went up sharply it went I think to 25 times
4641120	4646480	also before 2010 whenever there was talk of affect or emotion it was anxiety
4646880	4655280	after 2010 that that range increased so there is definitely increased interest
4656000	4666400	in in emotion and I totally agree with you that we need to avoid bogus ideas and there are bogus
4666400	4674160	ideas you know things like the lizard brain and and and stuff but we we think we I think we need to
4676240	4689920	be both critical but also courageous in trying to do solid research in areas where other people
4690880	4699040	may have had doubts so can you address the doubts can you convince them that this is solid
4699040	4702480	that you can actually measure this that people will agree with you
4702480	4707600	can you get your stuff published in the top journals if you can that's a kind of a validation
4707600	4714960	that flow is not just a bogus idea thanks I enjoyed I enjoyed your lecture
4715920	4721840	so hopefully we'll see each other in Sturck again I'm looking forward to that okay
4722480	4729680	right thank you very much both of you I think slowly time comes for a bit of round up
4731040	4739520	so I'm going to rely on my nose I really liked this metaphor I don't know how it is with you
4739520	4746400	guys but metaphors work with me so I like being able to hold into a metaphor and I really like
4746400	4751840	this one about the grain of sounds which you add to the pyramid of knowledge so we actually
4751840	4758640	build something huge and then when I was working with my boss professor Vishniewska on a very recent
4758640	4765520	paper I used another one which is in a way similar that's because that was about self-regulation
4765520	4772320	in the use of linguistic landscape and self-regulation is in general about being able to
4772880	4781440	use endless opportunities to learn worldwide and you spot the world as the endless stock of
4781440	4787360	knowledge and the first and most basic form of self-regulation is choosing the opportunity
4787360	4792880	you want to learn from so I think a lot of people are attending these lectures and I'm looking at
4792880	4802080	the people in the hall but also are relating to the people online have used this opportunity a lot
4802080	4807280	and I think it was a very wise choice using the opportunity of having Jean-Marc with us
4808240	4814400	I would also like to say that okay my boss has already mentioned one conference in 2025
4815120	4822400	uh to which she has invited Jean-Marc as a plenary speaker and we'll be honored
4823040	4830000	indeed if he appears but there is another one so I can officially say that we as a the Institute
4830000	4835920	of Applied Linguistics are going to apply for the organization of the Psychology and Language
4835920	4842960	Learning and Teaching Conference 2026 so we're going to go for the organization and hopefully
4842960	4848640	we can also meet here for that conference before that I'm pretty sure we're going to see each other
4848640	4858000	in Madrid in May so there will be time to talk about that too to round up thank you very much
4858000	4866800	for your for all your talks very inspirational and thank you very much indeed for being with us
4866800	4874640	and looking forward to seeing you again Jean-Marc thank you thank you very much it was a pleasure
4874640	4883600	talking to you all and I wish you all well in your academic careers and yeah it was a bit strange to
4883600	4891200	be only online but I'm looking forward to being in Poznan again at some point all right thank you
4891200	4897760	very much indeed and looking forward to seeing you here in the future in person thank you and
4897760	4909040	hello Camilla good to see you in person yeah thank you thank you so much thank you bye okay bye bye
