00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Final presentation of mine. I thought that after talking to you about specific research

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,440
topics that I've been interested in, that it might be interesting to talk about a more

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,200
general topic which is doing research in applied linguistics. And of course it's my personal

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:34,240
view because anyone who does research in applied linguistics at whatever level, whether that is

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:44,640
your BA research project or your MA dissertation or your PhD or any project beyond the PhD,

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:55,520
everybody is facing similar issues and of course the expectations change slightly as you progress

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:07,520
through your career. I would start by talk about some, I would say almost philosophical issues

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:18,640
about research and one of the things that always struck me was that students tend to have,

9
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:30,560
tend to believe in predeterminism. They see these libraries full of books and these journals full

10
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,440
of papers and they can see the publication lists of certain researchers and it's easy to think

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:52,800
that this was destined to happen and so that it was driven by God, faith or some unknown force

12
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:04,880
so they tend to underestimate the fact that in fact nothing is predetermined. If you're a researcher

13
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,840
you could go in a thousand different directions, you could ask a thousand different questions and

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,080
you have a choice between a huge amount of methods and so nothing of what actually is produced

15
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,960
is predetermined. It's the result of free choice, free spirits trying to do something

16
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:36,880
that they are interested in and so I would say that it's crucial to hence realize that

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,360
Lambert, Garner, Dornier to mention three of the biggest names in motivation research and second

18
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,800
language acquisition that they weren't destined to introduce motivation and I had a chat with

19
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:01,040
Garner and Dornier and they were kind of surprised to a certain degree by the fact that their papers

20
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,320
seemed to have so much impact. They hadn't necessarily anticipated it. They were also

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,880
interested in other things but it was motivation that made their name and so I quite like the little

22
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:24,240
picture there about the PhD. If you're standing at the door deciding what to do for your PhD

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,800
it may look like a maze and I totally agree and I think that in fact the first year of doing the

24
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,360
PhD is getting lost in the maze and getting a sense of just how big the maze is and wander around

25
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:48,480
without necessarily finding the exit straight away. So this research does not descend from heaven

26
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,960
that's really an absolutely crucial point so it's not like Moses coming down the mountain

27
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,760
with God's words. It's really the result of inspiration, hard work, sweat and resilience.

28
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,160
Resilience because things typically don't go right straight away and in fact any paper that

29
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:19,520
you see published in a journal typically has been rejected one or twice, has been rewritten

30
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:30,880
about 10 or 15 times and the amount of work that the authors put into it is hard to imagine when

31
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:39,600
you see a nice neat little text that looks like a perfect finished product. Also it's important

32
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,280
to realize that the peer review system is valuable meaning that not all good papers submitted to

33
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:56,480
journals will get to publication because reviewers or editors may think it's not a good fit with the

34
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:05,200
journal or the reviewers may not like this type of research or reviewers may have different opinions

35
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,120
about what is important and what is original. So it's important to realize that if you submit

36
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,680
something to a journal and it's rejected never take it personally. It doesn't mean that you are

37
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,360
therefore a bad researcher. Absolutely not. You have to develop resilience and you have to extract

38
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:39,600
useful information from the rejection letter. What is it that they didn't like? Why? Can you

39
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,040
address it? If you can't address it you know sometimes it's better to throw away a paper that

40
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:55,760
has some fundamental deficit. If you can adapt it and submit it somewhere else please do and sometimes

41
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:04,640
good papers can get rejected because they challenge orthodoxy. So I remember talking to

42
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:18,080
prominent researchers who Albert Costa, the late Catalan psycholinguist who was complaining that

43
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,840
journal editors want in fact more of the same with small variations. So you add one little

44
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,920
ingredient and you repeat what you have done before because they know that that's a product

45
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:44,800
that will sell, that will be appreciated and he was angry that journals rejected the new papers he

46
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,400
was writing on the foreign language effect and that they wanted more of the old stuff. So I guess

47
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,880
that researchers sometimes face the kind of issue that artists have or singers in that the public

48
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:10,480
wants the good old tunes, the big hits and they don't necessarily want to hear the

49
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:21,520
singers' latest creations. Of course if I say that papers don't descend from heaven it doesn't mean

50
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:32,480
that new theories appear out of nothing. So if you work on certain topics it's because other

51
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:40,160
people have preceded you in working on that topic that teachers have told you about a certain topic

52
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,720
or certain research questions so the ground was prepared and at that point you come in and you

53
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,920
think okay what could I do to turn this into something original? Could I ask a question that

54
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:02,160
hasn't been asked before and sometimes you do manage to do that and you end up reshaping the

55
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:10,400
trajectory of a discipline. Now this is a nice little conceptualization of doing research where

56
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,800
you collect data, you sort it, you arrange it, you present it visually and you explain it with

57
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:30,880
a story and I would say that the crucial final step really is the explaining with a story meaning

58
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:38,640
that I desk reject quite a lot of papers submitted to my Journal of Multilingual Multicultural

59
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,920
Development because the authors have been through the first four stages so they did collect data,

60
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:54,880
they sorted it, they arranged it and they did some visual representation however they did not

61
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:03,440
come up with a good story and any research paper, any dissertation, any project really,

62
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:13,600
if there is no good story then in fact it's a failure because what the reader is interested in

63
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,040
or the audience is interested in is a good story that is based on solid data that has

64
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,640
been properly sorted that has been arranged following the conventions of the discipline

65
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:35,440
and that have been presented visually in order to understand or make a point and then this needs to

66
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,640
be embedded in a good story and the thing is it doesn't really matter what the story is about

67
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:54,000
but it needs to be a good story. Now if you are an academic or you are a PhD researcher

68
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:04,160
you may have heard about the sentence you know publish or perish and so this is a nice book by

69
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,840
James Hines, it's a funny book really about a young academic, a young American academic

70
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:21,200
who faces that terrible pressure to publish in order not to perish and so I think this is an

71
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,680
important point because once you enter academia and you become a researcher you do realise that

72
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,680
there is a huge amount of pressure on you to do so many things, you have to you know first you

73
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,280
finish your PhD and then you have to do so much teaching and you have to do administration and

74
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,720
you're expected to come up with creative ideas and publish them in the best journals and then

75
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,600
you spend so much time writing these papers and then they get rejected and then you realise

76
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,800
and then you hear from your head of department that if you don't have five publications by

77
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,560
the end of the year we will not prolong your contract so you are under a considerable amount

78
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,440
of stress and too much stress risks killing creativity because you end up not sleeping

79
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:17,840
enough and not going for walks and not allow your brain to engage in the kind of deep thinking that

80
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,440
you can get when I don't know you go walking in the forest and you're looking at a lake and that's

81
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,480
where an idea might hit you so you need to create the conditions where you can be creative

82
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,360
and of course publications matter, the career really depends on the publication list

83
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:51,680
so when I was in selection committees at Bergbeck the threshold to be invited to an interview

84
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,960
for a lectureship would typically be about five papers and maybe a couple of book reviews

85
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:12,240
that would be the kind of standard entry to get invited and you need these few publications to

86
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,760
convince the potential employer that you have research potential. I also think that it's better

87
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,760
to have something than nothing so it means that at the very start of your career it's okay if you

88
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:37,120
have some publications in conference proceedings that's fine I always recommend it to my students

89
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,680
also to write some book reviews because that's a useful way to find your academic voice and have a

90
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:54,480
line on your CV avoid publishing crap meaning if you realize that what you have produced

91
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,680
isn't very good and you get advice from your supervisor telling you you know that that's not

92
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:09,360
really good material then avoid publishing it so I guess that as if you want to become a researcher

93
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,760
you need a strategic plan knowing what to publish where at what pace and with whom.

94
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:25,040
So how to get published I would say it really depends on your research interests and on your

95
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:34,480
field so you need to know within that field what topics are hot. It's pretty easy if you go to a

96
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,680
conference or you look at the conference program of a recent conference you know you you check

97
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:53,920
what topics are being discussed and what seems to be creating buzz because you don't want to

98
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,800
start working and trying to publish something on a topic that is considered that is no longer

99
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,560
considered cool or hot it needs to be something that people are currently interested in because

100
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:14,720
that's what will hand you a job at the point so it's important also to create a network of people

101
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:24,560
who have similar interests so go to conferences try to talk to the plenary speakers during

102
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,040
coffee breaks or during the conference dinner contact authors if there is a paper out that

103
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,480
you're interested in but you can't access it if you flatter them a little bit they will typically

104
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:45,040
send you the pdf also keep an eye out on calls for papers of conferences or special issues or

105
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,560
answer books on the topic that you are interested in so what to publish it could be a small research

106
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:00,720
project pilot studies I recommend where all my PhD students I have recommended that they try to

107
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,920
turn the most interesting findings of their MA thesis or dissertation into a little publication

108
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,600
you could also publish a critical review of literature on a topic and plenty of journals

109
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,760
that are interested in critical reviews you could write some critical analysis of a popular concept

110
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:33,360
or contribute to a discussion forum and and as I said before book reviews are really a good way

111
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:42,080
to get free books and these books are typically very expensive so what is you simply contact

112
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:51,280
the reviews editor of a journal tell him or her that you are a PhD student or a master student

113
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,760
with a huge interest in this topic and that you notice that this expensive new book came out and

114
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,640
that you would love to review it for the journal and that typically implies writing 2000 writing

115
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:12,000
2000 words where you point out what you liked and what you didn't like much about the book

116
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,440
don't be too harsh because the author of that book may be your future employer so you need to be

117
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,440
careful and then the book reviews editor will contact the editor and will send you a free copy

118
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,080
of the book and you typically have three months to write your book review then the other one is the

119
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,640
standard research paper typically between six and twelve thousand words there are also journals

120
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:47,040
that have options for shorter papers research in progress so that's typically somewhere between

121
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,840
three thousand and four thousand words and then there are also review papers where you write a review

122
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:04,720
of a particular area in the field um oh so before writing I would say that you need to come up you

123
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,520
need to develop an intuition or a gut feeling that something is original and is worth investigating

124
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,480
and that you happen to be the best person to do it and it's an intuition that you can typically

125
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,840
discuss with your supervisor because as supervisors we are very happy when students come up with

126
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:35,440
original ideas and I have published many papers with former bachelor students or master students

127
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,800
who came up with a really interesting idea and I thought oh yeah great let me supervise you properly

128
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:50,080
and let's make sure that we get good data and then they got a good grade for their BA or master

129
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,360
dissertation but of course these BA and master dissertations even if they have high grades they

130
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:05,760
are not necessarily publishable to turn a dissertation into a paper requires a lot of a lot of work so

131
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:15,360
we then turned it into papers and they got published so you need to formalize the intuition you need

132
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:25,600
to come up with a research design you need to develop a hypothesis based on previous literature

133
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,440
on previous research so you need a proper literature review then you collect the data

134
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:40,320
you as I said before you sort it you analyze it you see to what extent it confirms or disconfirms

135
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,320
previous research and what you do is really adding a grain of sand to the pyramid of knowledge

136
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,680
so I say that because

137
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,360
we shouldn't be over ambitious in the sense that the paper doesn't need to be revolutionary it

138
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:07,040
doesn't need to be the the 10 commandments that Moses came down with from his mountain

139
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,720
it just needs to be one gleaming beautiful perfectly

140
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,200
formed grain of sand and you add that to the pyramid of knowledge and you will have done your job

141
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,280
so it's good to assemble the data all the data before you start writing the paper

142
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,320
and I would say that when you write you write up the data do it as if you were talking to colleagues

143
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,160
then another question is whether you should go for co-authored or signal publications

144
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,240
I would say that it depends on the field in literature research most papers are signal authored

145
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,480
in social sciences in applied linguistics it's more common to see co-authored papers typically

146
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:09,040
between two and five authors if you look at physics for example or exact sciences stem

147
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,120
research you sometimes see a list of 10 authors because they are all the members of the lab

148
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:26,080
so that is rather unusual in applied linguistics it can be a great idea to co-author something

149
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,600
with somebody who has more experience than you because they know the ropes and they know how to

150
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:43,120
react to sharp comments by reviewers and they they know that if a reviewer recommends something

151
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,560
that you disagree with that you have the right to disagree and explain why you disagree and why

152
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,760
you will not follow the reviewer's recommendation and you may even have to appeal to the editor

153
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,880
saying you know reviewer three is asking me to drop this but I really think this is crucial

154
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:10,080
for this and this and this reason and so it's important to learn the practices in

155
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,520
publishing in applied linguistics I like co-authoring because I like working with people who have

156
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:28,320
skills that I don't have to the same extent for example I've been working with in Luis Botez

157
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:36,160
and Chen Chen Li who have amazing statistical skills there so they are psychometric specialists

158
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,000
so they can do things with stats that I couldn't do because I'm more self-taught

159
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:53,280
statistician and and it's great and then I help them write a good story and find some

160
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:01,600
interesting metaphors so finding the right journal that's a crucial and difficult question

161
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,040
do you go for the top journal or do you go for a lower ranked journal

162
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,960
and do you go for quantity or quality and my recommendation would be to aim for balance

163
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,240
where you have some quick intimate I wouldn't say low level in fact but more intermediate level

164
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,520
publications like conference proceedings web-based journals and then I would recommend

165
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:35,600
spending a lot of time and energy to try and get at least one paper into a really prestigious journal

166
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:44,560
because future selection committees will look at UCV and will say okay some conference proceedings

167
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:53,600
some mid-level journals but wow one paper in a really good journal and if you can do one then

168
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:01,600
the assumption is that you can do more so I would also say recommend that you send your best work

169
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,160
to the best journals so check whether the impact factor is high whether you know the people who

170
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:16,080
publish in that journal again ask advice to supervisors I would absolutely avoid non-referee

171
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:26,160
journals unless it's reviews or opinion pieces also avoid edited volumes with editors that don't

172
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:37,440
have a name in the field or working with co-authors that you don't trust much or you don't have much

173
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:48,160
of a reputation unless they are your students and avoid also volumes published by publishers that are

174
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:56,800
so-called pirate publishers there are a number of them and you need absolutely to avoid

175
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,520
publishing there so again that's something that you need to ask your supervisor and then the other

176
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,760
thing is that you probably need to avoid editors that work slowly because if you're at the start of

177
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,400
your career you don't want to wait two or three years for a chapter to come out

178
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:25,680
so as I said avoid predatory journal open access these days is becoming more

179
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:38,400
common institutions typically pay the to have the paper out in open access but you need to avoid

180
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:50,320
these so-called predatory journals so be extremely careful they typically contact you after you

181
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,760
presented something at the conference something that leaves a trace on the internet and then

182
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:06,320
they will you will get an invitation saying you know we we noticed that you produced this

183
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:14,400
magnificent or that you presented this magnificent paper we we think you are brilliant now will you

184
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:23,120
please submit your paper in our journal run away delete straight away because if somebody flatters

185
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:34,000
you it's probably a scam so because then there will be hidden payments the quality will be crap

186
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:44,000
and it risks in fact undermining your academic credibility so make sure you check

187
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,440
where you submit your paper now what to avoid in the paper and I'm saying this because as editor

188
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:00,880
I come across about 800 papers a year submitted to my journal and and I would typically reject

189
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:10,080
the ones that have very superficial literature reviews where there is just some reference

190
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,320
dropping but there isn't any critical engagement with the studies presented

191
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,560
also avoid claiming that very little research has been done in an area if you're not 100

192
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,960
percent sure and it's hard to be 100 percent sure because you can't know everything that has

193
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,400
been published and and it could be the reviewer reading your paper who happened to have produced

194
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,800
some research in that topic and he or she will be angry with you for claiming that very little

195
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:52,720
has been done also crucial to make sure that the text looks good sloppiness is dangerous

196
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,880
so make sure you stick to the style sheet of the journal that the references are in the right

197
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,560
format double check whether everything in the list of references is mentioned in the text and vice

198
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:15,200
versa make sure the spelling of surnames is correct because it really pisses a reviewer

199
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,600
of if his or her surname is badly spelled also avoid making sweeping generalizations

200
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:33,120
so always be very careful in discussing the the the results because what applies to

201
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:42,400
your particular data set might not apply to data sets collected from different participants

202
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,360
in different environments also avoid claims that cannot be substantiated and avoid a rhetorical

203
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,560
style that does not match that of the journal I would add to that avoid

204
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,640
taking sides in whatever argument you are presenting so you are writing an impartial

205
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,560
paper you are writing a paper on a topic you cannot choose a position so if you're not writing a

206
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:19,280
pamphlet to attack something or to defend something you are looking at with an impartial

207
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:28,000
pair of eyes and you may come to a conclusion that this is more correct than that or that you

208
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:37,920
prefer this to that but the paper cannot be written like it would be a pamphlet

209
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:46,320
so to get your paper accepted it's crucial to keep it simple so the story needs to be

210
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,520
a specific story on one specific theme so better to explain one idea in detail than too many

211
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:01,520
superficially and I would say that is a typical beginner's mistake beginner researcher want to

212
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:11,440
cram in too many ideas so my golden rule is less is more so the one idea needs to be

213
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:20,080
visible in the title must come clearly through in the abstract in the opening of the introduction

214
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:27,040
and again in the conclusion so people get it what the idea was so also follow the style and

215
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,960
the structure of papers published in the journal that you have in mind and if you think oh this is

216
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,760
also such a good idea I could also put it in there in fact my advice is split it off cut and paste

217
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:49,760
it in a separate document something that you can develop later try not to put too many eggs

218
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,400
in the one basket also think hard about the title when you finish the paper because sometimes you

219
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,480
start with a working title and then at the very end of the paper finishing the paper you realize

220
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,400
that in fact you need to revisit the title because the the the idea may have shifted a little bit

221
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,280
you may have focused on one aspect rather than what you announced in the title and and the title

222
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:23,280
really will determine whether or not your paper is cited if it's too long too clunky

223
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:32,640
it won't get much attention so also having a catchy title is good but don't there is no need to

224
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,880
have a catchy title but if you can come up with something catchy that that gets people's attention

225
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:46,000
that would certainly help so writing tips I would say writing a good introduction

226
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,400
in fact the first sentence is crucial if you don't catch the attention of the reader

227
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,480
and you don't convey the importance of the questions addressed in in that first sentence in

228
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,200
that first paragraph nobody is going to read the rest of the text so I would say that I

229
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,440
just reject again paper submitted to my journal if I read the introduction well I read the abstract

230
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,760
and I read the introduction and if halfway through the introduction I still don't know what this

231
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,720
paper is about I reject it because they didn't catch my attention so text can be written in

232
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,560
the past or present tense past tense okay if you describe results of an experiment but typically

233
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:39,840
present tense if it's a general conclusion good to write if you write in English you need to write

234
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,640
short sentences shorter than you would if you were writing in French or Italian for example

235
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:57,440
also avoid fluffy hermetic and complex ways of saying a simple thing so I would say that the

236
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:06,400
Anglo-Saxon requirement is really to not beat around the bush be as clear and as simple as possible

237
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,040
now I want to talk to you about something I find really interesting which is

238
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,840
comes from chaos theory and the dynamic systems theory which is the butterfly effect

239
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:29,920
namely the fact that a new idea at some point in time may feel like nothing more than the flapping

240
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:38,480
of wings and I don't know whether you know this metaphor of the butterfly effect it's the flapping

241
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:51,120
of the wings of a butterfly today in Poznan may be linked to a storm in Italy in two weeks because

242
00:32:52,240 --> 00:33:00,800
it could have unexpected consequences and because the world is a dynamic system

243
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,560
you don't know exactly what the consequences will be in our case of a particular paper

244
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,760
so sometimes a paper gets published and doesn't get cited very much for a couple of years and

245
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,560
then suddenly there is growing interest in the area and suddenly that paper may get started to

246
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:29,440
be cited more and more and you could say that you could say that that paper was in fact

247
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:39,280
the butterfly and that it had unexpected consequences or effects on the field

248
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,880
and so butterflies you could refer to butterflies by famous researchers like Galileo

249
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:57,200
when he first published his rejection of the geocentric model saying that you know the earth

250
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:08,160
circulates around the the sun very few people believed him and the church was very angry

251
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:13,200
and with him for making that claim and in the end it turned out that he was right

252
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:22,320
same with Einstein who introduced relativity again something that not many people believed

253
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:29,760
could be true when it was first published and then became the dominant paradigm in physics

254
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:40,240
and then I would also say that sometimes the butterflies can be political and I'm thinking

255
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:48,320
here about Tarek el Tayev Mohammed Bouazzi who was a modest street vendor and he set himself

256
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:56,560
on fire in 2010 in Tunisia and it was an act that led to the Tunisian revolution so the poor man was

257
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:09,200
desperate and wanted to express his protest in that act of self-immolation and that had consequences

258
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:18,480
so he was a kind of a butterfly now another thing that I'm interested in is how

259
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,800
research develops within sciences and how it develops within applied linguistics

260
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,520
and how that development is typically non-linear and I recommend the book by Thomas Kuhn on the

261
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,840
structure of scientific revolutions so where he explains that science goes through paradigm shifts

262
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,320
where current theories can't explain some phenomenon someone proposes a new theory

263
00:35:48,320 --> 00:36:00,480
so I would say that when Galileo came in he pointed out that the the observations did not

264
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:11,440
allow him to confirm the theory that earth was the center of the universe so more and more

265
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:20,000
observations led to the rejection of the old geocentric model and the introduction of the new

266
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:29,120
heliocentric model so that was a typical paradigm shift so this revolution occurs when the new

267
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:36,160
paradigm is better at explaining the observations offers a model that is closer to the objective

268
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:45,280
external reality and that the new paradigm is incommensurate with the old one so examples of

269
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:53,200
paradigm shifts in applied linguistics if you are a master student in applied linguistics you know

270
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:02,560
that it was behaviorism that it ended in fact when Chomsky in 1959 reviewed Skinner's verbal

271
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:12,240
behavior and where Chomsky said in fact language is not a collection of reinforced habits as the

272
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:21,120
behaviorists claimed children use language creatively so it was a kind it was the death

273
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:31,680
now for behaviorism in applied linguistics at the time also we have had a contrastive analysis

274
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,280
that was also inspired by behaviorism seeing language as a set of habits with second language

275
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,840
acquisition being the establishment of new habits where it was assumed that if there were errors in

276
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:53,200
the second language they were caused by the first language and the prediction that the

277
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,080
bigger the difference between a structure in the first and the second language the more errors

278
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,920
would occur in the second language and then Zobel was among those who pointed out that

279
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,280
French learners of English failed to show evidence of the predictor error but English learners of

280
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:20,160
French did so in French for those of you who know French you can say je les vois in English you

281
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,600
would have to put the object pronoun after the verb so you would say I see them however looking at

282
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:35,040
learner data Zobel realized that French learners of English never said things like I them see

283
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,280
which would be the expected pattern because then they would transfer their French syntactic pattern

284
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:53,120
yet English learners of French did produce sentences like je vois et instead of je la vois

285
00:38:53,120 --> 00:39:01,040
so the interference didn't go in both directions so the transfer of habits was not consistent across

286
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:11,120
languages okay so that was until now the the general advice about doing research

287
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,800
in applied linguistics and about the butterfly effects and I would say that in a certain sense

288
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:28,880
we all have experienced butterfly effects meaning that we have all done certain things

289
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,800
that led us on to certain paths and that we could not have predicted where they would take us so

290
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,240
when I started my career and so I will talk about these butterfly effects and and these trigger

291
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:53,120
events in in my own career and I started doing a masters in French in Brussels and I did my

292
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:02,480
master's dissertation on a theoretical topic namely a famous French linguist called Gustave

293
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:12,480
Guillaume and I managed to publish the findings of that dissertation in Travaux de Languistique

294
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:23,440
and I was really into theoretical French linguistics at the time but then my once I

295
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,880
started doing my PhD it was a PhD in applied linguistics on the acquisition of French as

296
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,840
a foreign language and I kind of abandoned theoretical linguistics and became more interested

297
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:42,160
in applied linguistics and so my first applied linguistic paper appeared in 92 was on the omission

298
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,920
of Neu in French interlanguage so that was in fact a combination of social linguistics and

299
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,760
applied linguistics and then I published my first papers in French then realized that I would probably

300
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,040
reach a wider audience if I wrote the papers in English but my English wasn't that good so I had

301
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:16,880
to ask a friend to help me out and so by 2000 I was writing in English and I was interested there

302
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,360
also in gender assignment and gender agreement in advanced French interlanguage that was

303
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:33,120
part of my PhD dissertation and I also became interested in the use of colloquial words and

304
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,800
emotional words and swear words in advanced French interlanguage so I was still very much

305
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:46,400
focused on French as a second language at the start of my career and then I had

306
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,960
critical incidents so I encountered my colleagues when I joined Bergbeck in 1994

307
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:04,240
I realized that I had gaps in my social pragmatic competence in English I was able to understand

308
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,760
I was able to understand most of what my colleagues said but I didn't always understand what they

309
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,040
actually meant so I understood the words but I didn't always get what their emotions were

310
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,680
and what they really meant so I couldn't really read between the stiff upper lips of my colleague

311
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:37,360
and then I had a chat with an aunt of mine who worked in palliative care and ELSE is her name

312
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:44,000
and she asked me so what do you do I said oh well you know I teach at the university and I do research

313
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:53,280
and I had just published it was the conversation happened in to early 2001 and I said you know and

314
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:03,520
I have had just this paper out on how learners of French agree gender sometimes and sometimes they

315
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,120
don't and isn't that fascinating and and she looked at me and she said so you are really splitting

316
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:17,520
hairs and I thought oh that's not very kind but I laughed and I said well I guess so yeah but you

317
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,960
know it's my hobby and I get paid to do it but it felt a bit lame and then 9-11 happened and I felt

318
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,200
that suddenly as applied linguists there was an urgent need for us to promote peace tolerance of

319
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,920
diversity in fact the underlining the value of multilingualism and multiculturalism and

320
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,880
positive thinking and that it was our moral duty as applied linguists to do some good

321
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:51,360
for society that we needed to get out of our ivory towers and so I left the ivory tower and

322
00:43:51,360 --> 00:44:02,640
met a huge amount of people and a few names there a picture there with Beverly Costa we got an award

323
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:12,880
for our work then bottom left is with Kasia Saito who's a great friend and then in the middle a picture

324
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:21,120
with Peter McIntyre, Tammy Gregerson and Elaine Horitz and Sarah Mercer who became lifelong friends

325
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:30,320
and to the right there holding the distinguished scholarship award from AAA L Annetta Pavlenko

326
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,960
surrounded by Peter De Costa and Lourdes Ortega so all these people became really good friends

327
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:47,200
and I realized that one of my early papers really had an impact we were among the first to introduce

328
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:56,880
the word emotion in applied linguistics and in a paper in 2002 and then Annetta and I realized

329
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,160
that the emotion was really an interesting topic that not much had been written about it

330
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,640
and that we could organize panels on emotions and multilingualism at different conferences

331
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,080
which is what we did in the early 2000s and then based on these panels we

332
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:24,000
guest edited special issues in different journals and so we attracted attention to the topic and

333
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:35,280
we invited colleagues to join us and then we developed a follow-up study we developed a

334
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,200
bilingualism and emotion questionnaire which was probably the first and the biggest online

335
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:49,040
questionnaire in applied linguistics it remained online for two years collected data from over 1500

336
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,520
multilinguals and those of you who listened to my first talk remember that it was about

337
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:05,040
language preferences to express emotions also information on proficiency on anxiety and we

338
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,400
found that the first language is typically preferred for communication of emotion and it's

339
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:17,120
typically felt to have most emotional resonance so once we had all those data we published papers

340
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:23,120
on that and then we realized that we both had to publish a book on it and that it would be

341
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:29,920
more helpful to each have a separate book rather than to have a co-author book so Annetta published

342
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:42,800
her book pretty soon in 2005 and then I published mine five years later with a slightly different

343
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:53,280
focus and so the mine was more had more statistics in it than Annetta and you I don't remember whether

344
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:02,640
I told you that the face the self-portrait on the cover of my book is in fact a painting that is

345
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:10,080
hanging here in my office it's the self-portrait by my maternal grandfather from 1933 and he was

346
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:16,640
a passionate bilingual so I thought right he's the perfect person and this is the perfect

347
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:28,800
cover for my book and then in 2005 I was also among the first to call for more attention to

348
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,200
psychological and emotional dimensions in second language acquisition research and again I didn't

349
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:45,920
know at the time that that paper would get cited quite a lot and then interesting emotion research

350
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,320
started to develop more gradually in applied linguistics it had been dominantly cognitive

351
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:58,960
until the time with the focus on observable and measurable units and I had this chat with John

352
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,400
Schumann who's one of the founders of applied linguistics and professor of applied linguistics

353
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:16,480
at UCLA in California and he said well you know it's about applied linguists wanting to make sure

354
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,960
that they are taken seriously that they do that they are real scientists so they use sophisticated

355
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:33,840
statistics so they can legitimately be considered as scientists and he said emotions are probably

356
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,080
less attractive because they have no observable physical reference in the world and they fell

357
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:50,880
outside of the traditional remit of second language acquisition so the winds of change started to come

358
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:57,520
with the introduction of more qualitative research in applied linguistics where it suddenly became

359
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:04,640
okay to look at the L2 learners subjective side that included emotion, investment, duty,

360
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:13,040
love, desire and I refer here to the work by Claire Kramsch and Anita Pavlenko and I think I also

361
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,560
reminded you during my first session about the metaphor about emotions being the elephant in

362
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,800
the room that everybody knows they are there but they are not really taken into consideration

363
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,600
because they are considered to be inferior to rational thought and hopefully this change now

364
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:39,920
with the prior saying that yeah there is an elephant but it's time to open the windows and

365
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:48,160
to move on and so we have had the so-called emotional term and also the effective term

366
00:49:48,320 --> 00:50:00,240
in fact I guess applied linguists and authors love to coin a nice new collocation linked to

367
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,360
their name so emotional term effective term they are good collocation see it shows that

368
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:12,880
there suddenly is some kind of maybe not paradigm shift but mini paradigm shift

369
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:23,760
also I ran the ngram viewer to look at the use of the word emotion in written text since the

370
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:34,160
1800s and you see that there's been a sharp increase in the word emotion since the 1990s

371
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,600
really so I would say that my interest in emotional and applied linguistics in a sense

372
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:47,520
reflects an increased interest in that word and an increased use of that word

373
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:54,960
across different disciplines across different genres and styles so I guess there is more

374
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:04,880
publicity ads that play on our emotions today than they would have 40 years ago

375
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,720
also although there wasn't much about emotion in applied linguistics in fact there were

376
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:18,720
emotional journals in psychology and these three journals were all established late 20th century

377
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:28,960
early of our current century so you see that there was interest in emotion that it typically

378
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:36,720
started at that point but it took a little while before it came into applied linguistics and

379
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:48,640
the introduction in Dorne and Ryan in 2015 is telling in that the authors say that of course

380
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,600
the classic individual differences paradigm in applied linguistics barely acknowledges

381
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:05,760
the central role of emotions and feelings and emotions play a huge part in all our lives

382
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,800
they have been shunned to a large extent by both psychology and second language acquisition

383
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,840
literature so there is a general emotional deficit and they acknowledge

384
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:26,400
that the 2005 version of their book reflected this trend so it was an ongoing conversation

385
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:34,960
I had with Zoltan and with Steven Ryan that that emotion needed more attention and why

386
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,880
weren't they talking about emotion more and so I was pretty happy in 2015 when they acknowledged

387
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:48,640
that yes they should have talked more about emotion and then I also realized that of course

388
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:57,440
our research is spread over different fields that in the social psychological research tradition

389
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,480
motivation researchers typically had included anxiety dimensions but had never included

390
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,200
positive emotion dimensions if there were positive emotions there were typically item

391
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:18,400
level emotions like I like my English class but there wasn't a proper foreign language

392
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,600
enjoyment dimension for example and most research on emotions had focused on foreign language

393
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:31,520
classroom anxiety also looking at applied linguistics there is in fact only one journal

394
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,160
journal for the psychology of language learning that has the word psychology in the title and I

395
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,880
also added the journal of language and social psychology but that's in fact a psychological

396
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:53,520
paper so it's a social psychological journal I talked to you in my second session about

397
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:01,440
learner emotions and how the interest in learner emotions came after the introduction of positive

398
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:09,440
psychology in applied linguistics 2012 paper by Pete McIntyre and Gregerson and then a 2014

399
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,560
paper also by McIntyre and Mercer about what positive psychology could bring to second language

400
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:26,800
acquisition research it was followed by two edited books one edited in Poland by Danuta

401
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:34,240
Gampis Barker and her colleague Dagmara on positive psychology perspectives in foreign

402
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,640
language learning and teaching and also a book published by Multilingual Matters edited by

403
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:48,240
McIntyre Gregerson and Mercer on positive psychology in SNA and the publication of these two books

404
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:57,120
helped strengthen the growing interest in positive psychology in learner emotions and also later

405
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:04,720
in teacher emotions and then in my second session I presented the paper that I co-authored

406
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:11,760
with Peter McIntyre the Two Faces of Yanus where we presented the concept of foreign language

407
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:25,680
enjoyment it's been my most cited paper and then also with Chen Chen Li we published a paper in

408
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,840
a Chinese journal which I like because we shouldn't just publish in international

409
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:42,880
journals we should also publish in national journals where we talked about the four or

410
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,000
the three phases of emotions where they were first avoided because cognition was the only

411
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,880
thing that mattered then the second phase where there was interest in anxiety including the work

412
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:05,280
by crashing on his effective filter hypothesis and then Elena's horrid foreign language classroom

413
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:12,000
anxiety and the phase we are currently in which is a positive and negative emotions phase

414
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,120
thanks to the emotional turn and positive psychology where we've taken a more holistic

415
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:24,240
view on emotions and look at a variety of different emotions that learners and teachers

416
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:33,520
may experience so we conceptualized enjoyment as this complex and positive emotion that occurs

417
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:40,640
when people not just meet their needs but exceed them do something unexpected you may remember that

418
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:48,080
I cited the meta-analysis that showed that if you suffer from high anxiety in your classroom

419
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:55,360
you typically don't do as well whereas if you enjoy your foreign language classroom a lot

420
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:01,840
you are typically more willing to communicate and you typically will have better results so the

421
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:09,440
pedagogical implication of that is that teachers can create optimal positive atmosphere so part of

422
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:19,680
my research output has been the creation of new instruments and those turned out to be highly

423
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,680
cited although we didn't really do it to get high citation but if you develop a new instrument

424
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:32,960
to do further research on a certain topic they need to be solid and so you see I love collaborating

425
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:41,760
with Ilwis Bottes and Chen Chen Li to do this and then you know I don't want to read this out

426
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:49,680
obviously but we did a lot of work on the sources and the effects of enjoyment anxiety and boredom

427
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:58,560
how that is linked to teacher behavior how different positive personality traits are linked

428
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:05,120
to willingness to communicate and to performance how it's linked to trait emotional intelligence

429
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,160
we also looked at enjoyment in first language classes and discovered that it is that different

430
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:19,440
from foreign language classes and yeah and then more recently I did a couple of

431
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:26,960
studies on teacher emotions teachers who are forced to smile in front of a class when they

432
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:35,840
don't feel like smiling because they are tired or stressed and and also the the role of the teacher

433
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:41,680
in front of the class where through a process of emotional contagion a happy teacher can make the

434
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:51,040
whole classroom happy unhappy teacher can also contain you know in fact the everybody and where

435
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,800
everybody feels depressed so as a teacher you really need that emotional labor to keep a smile on

436
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:04,560
your face and on the face of your your students and then with Prihati Ergun we looked at the link

437
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:10,160
between well-being resilience and foreign language teaching enjoyment so that that's another

438
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:20,240
interesting concept so what what makes a teacher enjoy his or her teaching and and to what extent

439
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:28,640
is it linked to teacher internal variables like well-being and resilience and then I did a lot of

440
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:38,960
work thanks to a PhD student of mine on emotion recognition and so how do we recognize how a

441
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:48,720
multilingual feels when we watch or an audio when we watch a video recording or when we listen to an

442
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:57,760
audio recording and and this turns out to to to be an area of research that that really caught my

443
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:04,560
attention and and it was thanks to this PhD student Pernell Lorette and a number of other

444
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:13,360
lovely colleagues and then I think also in my first lecture that I mentioned how my interest in emotion

445
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:23,280
developed into the more specific context of multilingualism in psychotherapy

446
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:32,800
where we discovered that very often multilingual clients feel that their multilingualism and

447
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:40,240
multiculturalism is not sufficiently addressed in therapy and that there are also differences

448
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:48,560
between monolingual and multilingual therapists in how they deal with their with their clients and

449
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:55,840
that research won us a reward an award from the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy

450
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:03,600
so it was clear that we had been doing something original that had practical implications and

451
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:09,920
the practical implications we worked on them trying to raise awareness about multilingualism

452
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:17,680
and the issues that this implies for the psychotherapist and we published a couple of papers

453
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:26,560
on that topic also thanks to Beverly Costa we try to disseminate our findings to a larger audience

454
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:35,440
and Beverly Costa not only did she train about 3000 trainee therapists in a program called

455
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:42,640
Improving Access to Psychological Therapists in the UK training also a clinical supervisor

456
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:52,640
but she also had the brilliant idea to hire an established author to turn to

457
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:04,000
turn our research findings and her case notes into a play so Andrew Weir wrote the session

458
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:16,080
based on an original idea by Mother Tong and it's about a Polish woman married to a British man

459
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:23,200
and they have communication problems and he doesn't value her cultural background enough and

460
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:33,360
there is some trauma about the child and so it was performed at the Soho Theatre and about

461
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:40,800
3000 people came to see that play and so the play was really about the issues that we had

462
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:48,080
found in our research and that was a nice way to disseminate the findings also our research

463
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:55,280
had an impact in that the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapists clearly

464
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:04,000
added the importance of being aware of unconscious linguistic bias assumptions

465
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:13,040
and privilege if you work with multilingual clients the crucial need to offer linguistically

466
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,560
sensitive supervision acknowledging the role of language and identity development processing

467
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:25,360
of trauma memory recall and emotional expression so that was in fact clearly linked to the work

468
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,080
I had been doing with Beverly Costa and that applies to the UK but it implies in fact it

469
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:38,560
applies to other contexts also of course so to conclude I would say that research doesn't

470
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:44,640
emerge in a vacuum that emotion research emerged against the odds that was kind of inevitable

471
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,480
that intense academic socialization collaboration needs to join development and new ideas

472
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:58,240
I think it really helps to write in English to reach a wider audience I think it's also crucial

473
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:04,480
to talk to people from neighboring disciplines for cross-fertilization and that doing research is

474
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:10,560
just fantastic it's exhilarating intoxicating unpredictable and I would say that it is absolutely

475
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:17,440
worth the effort and because there were so many words I want to finish with some pictures so the

476
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,520
top left picture you will recognize the face of Zoltan Doge at the conference dinner in

477
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:32,400
grass in 2014 and beneath that is a Jew who is sitting on the floor during a triple AL conference

478
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:41,280
being in a packed room and being a bit tired and at the bottom left there I was at an emotion

479
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:49,040
conference with my then current PhD and former PhD students and then the other pictures again

480
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:57,520
walking going to conferences having dinners and top right is my friend Lee Wei giving a

481
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:06,240
plenary at conferences meaning what I'm saying here is that research happens because you are

482
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:12,480
collaborating with absolutely lovely people and if somebody turns out not to be lovely you just

483
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,240
drop them and you work with the ones that you appreciate and that keep their word and that

484
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:25,920
have the integrity and honesty and friendship and if they can bake banana breads when you

485
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,360
go to a conference and they give you a bit of banana bread that's even better that's a hint

486
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:38,960
because that's what Jakub did at the last euro slot conference so many thanks and I hope you will

487
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:49,680
have some questions for me encouraged by all means and the priority goes to the people in the room

488
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:56,000
you know that you can approach this place anytime you are not seen because the camera is off

489
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,160
so all you need is a bit of courage we had that happen before so if you think of asking a question

490
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,960
now is the perfect opportunity first of all the people in the hall

491
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:21,200
especially those people who are thinking of doing perhaps further research and applied linguistics

492
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,760
I can see that there is a question in the chat

493
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,040
all right

494
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:42,640
yes let me start with the first hello hello Joe Mark can you hear me okay go ahead yes

495
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,800
it's Jace Krisevich

496
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:55,600
I decided to to write you to write a question or rather not a question but a comment

497
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,240
so if you if you don't mind I will just I would just read the read those out so

498
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:11,040
I have two comments to make first of all I'd be cautious to take to advise young scholars

499
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:19,040
in the first half of your lecture here to better publish something than nothing

500
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,040
even though you immediately done played this with the recommendation not to publish crap

501
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:33,440
what I think is that unfortunately in in the majority of cases the urge and the pressure

502
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:44,240
on young people to to publish and the imperative to do so especially nowadays in what I call mass

503
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:50,160
university culture where we have dozens and dozens and dozens of phd students

504
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:55,680
taking interest in second language acquisition first language acquisition god knows what

505
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:03,840
and they are really pressed not maybe not that pressed in poland as they are in in in uh in your

506
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:12,800
country or in the west in general so this leads to unfortunately this leads to this something

507
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:21,760
that is better than nothing it leads to this something being of rather low both intellectual

508
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:29,760
as well as methodological piece of pseudo research yeah my second comment is the first one first

509
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:38,800
okay so so when I say something is better than nothing I meant in fact book reviews

510
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:48,720
write book reviews and write them for good journals so um because writing a book review

511
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:56,000
might not be what you originally would love to have which is a research paper but I would say

512
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,640
I would argue that that is the crucial first step right a couple of book reviews and after

513
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:10,720
that you will have acquired the skills to write research papers so don't run before you can walk

514
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:17,120
I would say although on this point I would also disagree with you you know I I can't

515
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:27,520
frankly speaking I can't somehow imagine a beginning phd student to write let's say a review of

516
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:34,640
of Derneis wrote on Derneis the psychology of language learner book review with well this little

517
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:44,800
experience in research very little experience in in in methodology in teaching in what really

518
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:53,920
the job is about the review okay the review might be a kind of review which you a student

519
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:01,680
might be encouraged to present in his seminar or something but I would I would be very cautious to

520
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:11,680
advise this for him to publish this because I mean this is this is my yeah my my opinion okay I

521
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:20,560
agree with you that writing a really good book review is difficult but it is feasible for someone

522
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:27,840
who's starting a phd because it shows an ability to synthesize so they need to to say okay this

523
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:33,680
book has three parts it's a part about this it's a part about that it's a part about that

524
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:40,160
so so that is not too difficult right if you are if you have a masters you can do this and

525
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:47,920
the final part then you don't need to have huge research experience to say that you really enjoyed

526
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,240
this and that that that you you you felt the author could have said more on that and that

527
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:01,520
and and so you you don't say anything obviously wrong or anyway the reviews editor would say well

528
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,240
you know you're a bit too negative or maybe you're a bit too positive or maybe you should do a bit of

529
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:15,120
that so you get some feedback but it's not too hard to produce a book review if you don't have too

530
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,760
much research experience but of course I mean we could discuss this further over a glass of beer

531
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:26,560
it's a huge topic but I would like to comment here too so my case my story is a bit different

532
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:34,000
and I think there are quite a few people like me who did their phd not as young people but in my case

533
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:41,440
after about 20 years of teaching experience and for me conceptualizing a topic in my case

534
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:46,240
how to facilitate self-regulated learning in a foreign language classroom

535
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:55,040
was a kind of literature review I did not use any data and I also did that like some other reviews

536
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,120
first because I was at the very early stage of my career and second we had a covid pandemic

537
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:09,120
so there was a limited opportunity to produce any sort of research so I just published to publish

538
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,960
something I'm not fully happy with the publication because there is also this thing that you know

539
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:21,440
year after year you become more critical of your own work which I think is quite natural

540
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:27,200
but I think it's not wasted effort so I had to think I had to conceptualize it

541
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,760
it had a revolving theme and it also gave me an opportunity to grow

542
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,920
mm-hmm so I'd say there is there is some positive thing about writing reviews

543
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,240
yeah

544
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,600
yeah we have one more comment one more comment and question from Dr Rusevich go on

545
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:59,440
so my my second point is about the neglect of affect so I don't think that affect has been I'll

546
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,200
just read through this has been neglected in second language acquisition at least not from

547
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:11,280
crashans affective filter theory I think that the problem with the affective factors is not that

548
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:19,440
the effects are unobservable as you said but that they are difficult to operationalize and tease out

549
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:26,800
from the intricate interplay of the whole array of emotional influences that are at play in second

550
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:32,880
language acquisition consequently the relative difficulty of identifying the affective effects

551
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:39,840
in second language acquisition following the difficulty in their operationalization leads

552
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:46,240
an ever-increasing number of young scholars to fall victim to some pre scientific and

553
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:53,040
straightforwardly bogus ideas which have been flying around for decades in second language

554
01:13:53,040 --> 01:14:03,440
acquisition and particularly in teacher training okay and here I mean ideas like multiple intelligences

555
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:10,640
for example flow by jigs and mihi okay matching learning styles with instruction

556
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:24,880
nlp neuro uh neuro didactics uh the the pre preoccupation with totally unresearchable

557
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:34,960
ideas unoperationalizable ideas like boredom and so on and this simply takes the whole attention

558
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:41,840
of the real factors involved in second language acquisition which are researchable

559
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:50,720
to those on which scholars can sort of float without really doing anything serious in that

560
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:59,440
matter this is my comment Jean-Marc okay you know I've been always I've been always critical of

561
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:08,560
this kind of things okay uh what do you say about that I my my reaction is don't throw the baby out

562
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:19,120
with the bathwater that yes of course there are things that are over the top in in second language

563
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:26,160
acquisition research as in any area of research and that you need to discern what what is useful

564
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:33,360
and what isn't I mean that that's your responsibility as a researcher I kind of smile

565
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,360
because you don't like flow and I just inserted a reference to a paper that came out in a plot

566
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:48,320
linguistics earlier this week on flow and I talked about it in my session I don't think flow is

567
01:15:49,200 --> 01:16:01,520
um a useless concept I think it's a very very interesting concept now the thing is

568
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:10,560
it's a metaphor this is a metaphor well no it describes something but sometimes you can

569
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:16,800
describe things that aren't necessarily always directly measurable in the sense that we

570
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:23,440
although in fact in the paper we do refer to neuro research that shows that specific areas

571
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:30,000
of the brain are in fact more heavily involved when people reach a flow state so this is not

572
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,800
esoteric stuff this is based on on solid science

573
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:48,400
the answer to the interesting affect in fact in a 2019 paper published in the modern language

574
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:56,800
journal I checked how often the word emotion and affect had been used in the modern language

575
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:07,840
journal on average and it turned out that before 2010 it was like an average of 8.5 times

576
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:20,320
a year that that word had been used after 2010 it went up sharply it went I think to 25 times

577
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:26,480
also before 2010 whenever there was talk of affect or emotion it was anxiety

578
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:35,280
after 2010 that that range increased so there is definitely increased interest

579
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:46,400
in in emotion and I totally agree with you that we need to avoid bogus ideas and there are bogus

580
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:54,160
ideas you know things like the lizard brain and and and stuff but we we think we I think we need to

581
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:09,920
be both critical but also courageous in trying to do solid research in areas where other people

582
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:19,040
may have had doubts so can you address the doubts can you convince them that this is solid

583
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,480
that you can actually measure this that people will agree with you

584
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,600
can you get your stuff published in the top journals if you can that's a kind of a validation

585
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:34,960
that flow is not just a bogus idea thanks I enjoyed I enjoyed your lecture

586
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,840
so hopefully we'll see each other in Sturck again I'm looking forward to that okay

587
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:49,680
right thank you very much both of you I think slowly time comes for a bit of round up

588
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:59,520
so I'm going to rely on my nose I really liked this metaphor I don't know how it is with you

589
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,400
guys but metaphors work with me so I like being able to hold into a metaphor and I really like

590
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,840
this one about the grain of sounds which you add to the pyramid of knowledge so we actually

591
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:18,640
build something huge and then when I was working with my boss professor Vishniewska on a very recent

592
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:25,520
paper I used another one which is in a way similar that's because that was about self-regulation

593
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:32,320
in the use of linguistic landscape and self-regulation is in general about being able to

594
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:41,440
use endless opportunities to learn worldwide and you spot the world as the endless stock of

595
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:47,360
knowledge and the first and most basic form of self-regulation is choosing the opportunity

596
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:52,880
you want to learn from so I think a lot of people are attending these lectures and I'm looking at

597
01:19:52,880 --> 01:20:02,080
the people in the hall but also are relating to the people online have used this opportunity a lot

598
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:07,280
and I think it was a very wise choice using the opportunity of having Jean-Marc with us

599
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:14,400
I would also like to say that okay my boss has already mentioned one conference in 2025

uh to which she has invited Jean-Marc as a plenary speaker and we'll be honored

601
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:30,000
