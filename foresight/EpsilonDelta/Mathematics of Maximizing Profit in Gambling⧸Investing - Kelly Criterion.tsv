0	4760	Suppose there is a game with the probability of winning of 1 third.
4760	10080	And if you win, you will get 1.8 times the amount of money that you risk on the play.
10080	12880	And if you lose, you lose the entire wager.
12880	18200	Then, we can calculate the expected value of the payout by summing over all possible
18200	23460	events of the probability of each event times the payout of each event.
23460	29400	And once we calculate the expected value for this game, it comes out to a negative value.
29400	34200	You have no edge at all in this game, so you may get lucky first few times, but there is
34200	36640	no long-term winning strategy.
36640	43000	So you will inevitably donate all your money to the house if you keep playing.
43000	47080	Now let's consider a second game where if you win, you get paid the amount of money
47080	48160	you risk.
48160	51740	Or in other words, you double your betting amount.
51740	55140	Suppose that you have a 100% chance of winning this game.
55140	59740	And it doesn't quite matter what happens if you lose, since you are guaranteed to win.
59740	63700	And you are expected to double your money each time you play the game.
63700	66380	Then what is your long-term winning strategy?
66380	70580	Well, you essentially have a money printer, so you might as well put your entire life
70580	72700	savings on each play.
72700	76820	Even better, you can maximize your profit by playing on a margin, meaning you should
76820	82140	borrow the biggest amount of money that you possibly can, and put all your assets, including
82140	86740	your kidney and liver, as a collateral for the margin.
86740	91220	We looked at two extreme examples, one where you have no edge at all and there is no long-term
91220	95740	winning strategy, and another where you are guaranteed to win each time and your winning
95740	98780	strategy is to bet everything each time.
98780	103820	So the real interesting problem is, when your expected payout is positive, but you are not
103820	106580	guaranteed to win.
106580	109900	Let's take a look at one such example.
109900	115060	You should buy some S&P 500 index fund, which is a fund that takes top 500 American companies
115060	119180	and averages them by their company's value.
119180	123660	And let's say you implement a strategy to sell at a profit when the price doubles and
123660	128220	cut your losses when the price drops by 25%.
128220	133740	Taking the historical data starting from 2003 and back-testing this strategy, I calculated
133740	138420	that the probability of win is roughly 59%.
138420	142740	Because we are expected to win more, and each win pays much more than how much we lose
142740	148780	each loss, the expected payout per play obviously has to be a positive value.
148780	154020	This game definitely is worth playing, but how much should you risk each play?
154020	158180	One possible strategy commonly used by the members of the subreddit Wall Street Pets
158180	163100	is called Food Stamps or Lambo, which is a strategy to risk everything in order to maximize
163100	164900	your potential profit.
164900	169420	So for this strategy, we can maximize the expected value by maximizing the value of
169420	174300	R, so you take 4x leverage to risk everything you own.
174300	180860	Naively, that is the optimal strategy since you are maximizing the expected average profit.
180860	185660	You make it lucky first few times, but if you continue to all-in each play, you will
185660	188620	eventually lose everything.
188620	193300	The very act of maximizing expected payout actually leads to ruin.
193300	199020	So there must be a better long-term strategy, right?
199020	201820	Let's start by defining the problem.
201820	205260	Suppose there is a game where you know the probability of winning, which we will call
205260	211860	P, and Q, the probability of losing, which equals 1-P.
211860	218060	The game is repeated N times, and each play you will risk a fixed percentage, R, of your
218060	220060	portfolio.
220060	225060	And each time you win, you will gain T times R, and each time you lose, you will lose S
225060	226820	times R.
226820	230540	And let's put on some auxiliary conditions.
230540	236380	The amount you can lose is at most your entire portfolio, so you cannot have a negative balance.
236380	239140	And you are not guaranteed to win.
239140	243620	And we want N to be sufficiently large since we are looking for our long-term sustainable
243620	245140	strategy.
245140	250740	So you are expected to win some and lose some, but still end up profitable in the long run.
250740	255700	Then what fraction of your portfolio should you risk each play to maximize the long-term
255700	258620	average profit?
258620	262060	You may have noticed how we are restricted to binary scenarios.
262060	266260	But in the real world, there are many games with more than two outcomes.
266260	272980	For example, the Powerball Lottery has 9 different ways you can win, each with different payout.
272980	277460	And you can't even have a game with a continuum of outcomes that depend on some continuous
277460	279460	distribution.
279460	284520	As interesting as those scenarios sound, they are too difficult to cover on a single video.
284520	290420	So for this video, we will focus only on binary outcomes.
290420	294180	Before we start solving the problem, I want to start with the answer so we can work our
294180	295980	way towards it.
295980	301260	So the optimal risk we should take per play is P, the probability of win, over S, the
301260	308820	percentage loss per loss, minus Q, the probability of loss, over T, the percentage gain per win.
308820	313820	The amount you should risk grows as the probability of win goes up, as the first term is linearly
313820	319700	proportional with respect to P. And the optimal risk also goes up as percentage gain per win
319700	325980	grows, since the second term is negative inversely proportional with respect to T.
325980	330780	This intuitively makes sense as an investment is considered better if you win more and each
330780	333260	time you win, you win more money.
333260	338660	Similarly, the optimal risk decreases as the probability of loss and the amount of loss
338660	342020	per loss goes up.
342020	345820	This formula is known as the Kelly Criterion.
345820	349380	It's best to look at some extreme cases of the formula.
349380	353940	So if we have a perfectly balanced game with equal chance of win and loss, and equal gain
353940	359900	and loss, the optimal risk is nothing, meaning this isn't a game worth playing.
359900	364040	If we instead have a game where you're less likely to win and your gain per win is less
364040	369020	than your losses, then your optimal R value comes out to negative.
369020	372300	What this means is that you don't want to be playing the game, but you want to be sitting
372300	376220	on the other side and taking a short position, being the casino or the insurance company
376220	378580	stealing money from you.
378580	382140	Now what if the game is extremely good in your favor?
382140	386260	Then your R value can come out to something bigger than one, meaning you should invest
386260	393020	not only your entire portfolio, but take a leverage and invest with borrowed money.
393020	397100	Notice how I put quotation marks around the word average.
397100	400940	The first question I want to ask is, what even is an average?
400940	406020	There is a generalized mathematical definition of the word, as mathematicians love to abstractify
406020	407260	everything.
407260	412940	But for now, we will just think of it as some measure of central tendency, or a good representative
412940	415460	element of a data set.
415460	420500	And the average that we are all very familiar with is the arithmetic mean, or sometimes
420500	424060	just call the mean when the context is clear.
424060	428620	And we compute it by adding up all the numbers in the data set and dividing by how many numbers
428620	430020	there are.
430020	435860	There is another kind of mean called the quadratic mean, or sometimes called root mean squared.
435860	440260	And we get it by taking the arithmetic mean of all the squares of numbers, then taking
440260	442620	the square root.
442620	446660	Another common mean that we use is called the harmonic mean, and we get it by taking
446660	451540	the arithmetic mean of all the reciprocals, then taking the reciprocal.
451540	456460	And using similar idea, we can extend the definition to work for all real numbers, except
456460	458340	for zero.
458340	463460	And even for zero, we can just take the limit as alpha goes to zero, to define the zero
463460	467740	mean, which is known as the geometric mean.
467740	471500	As alpha grows bigger, more weight is placed on bigger values.
471500	476220	And as alpha gets smaller, more weight is placed on smaller values.
476220	481420	So if we take the limit as alpha goes to negative infinity, we get the smallest value of the
481420	483100	data set.
483100	488900	And if we take the limit to the positive infinity, we get the maximum value.
488900	494100	Now when is it appropriate to use these different types of means?
494100	498660	One person having $3 and another person having $5.
498660	503660	If Karl Marx saw this, he would want to equally distribute wealth.
503660	507980	Then the most appropriate average would be the arithmetic mean.
507980	513780	Now, consider a second situation where you are a successful day trader and triple your
513780	517740	money the first year and five extra money the second year.
517740	520700	Then what is your average growth per year?
520700	525820	It is equivalent to roughly 3.873 xing your money each year.
525820	530260	So when we have a compound growth and want to calculate average growth, geometric mean
530260	532580	is the most appropriate.
532580	537820	Now consider the next situation where person A can finish a task in three days and person
537820	540420	B can finish a task in five days.
540420	545500	Then what is the average number of days it takes a person to finish the task?
545500	550300	If both of them are working on the task concurrently, we can add the rates together.
550300	553580	And we can divide by two to get the average rate.
553580	558420	So it means that person A can finish one third of a job per day and person B is working
558420	560580	at one fifth of a job per day.
560580	565340	Then it is equivalent as if each person was finishing four fifteen per day.
565340	570340	So on average, it takes fifteen over four days to finish a task.
570340	574460	And this is an appropriate situation to take the harmonic mean.
574460	579740	Now, consider the next scenario where there are two chambers filled with the same homogenous
579740	581340	ideal gas.
581340	585100	And each chamber contains the same amount of gas.
585100	590100	Now, suppose the mean speed of the molecules in the left chamber is three and the right
590100	592140	chamber is five.
592140	594980	So the right chamber is a bit hotter.
594980	601340	Now once you connect the two chambers together, they will eventually reach a thermal equilibrium.
601340	605460	And the mean speed of the molecules on both sides of the chamber will eventually balance
605460	608580	out to a number between three and five.
608580	611540	So what is this average speed after mixing?
611540	615460	Well, we know that the temperature on the left and the right will eventually reach an
615460	617580	arithmetic mean.
617580	622820	And since temperature is, roughly speaking, the average kinetic energy of the molecules,
622820	625940	it is proportional to the square of the mean speed.
625940	629940	And for those of you who are curious what the constant of proportionality is, it is
629940	635860	pi times the mass of the air molecule, all over eight times the Boltzmann constant.
635860	640980	So now, to find the average mean velocity after the thermal equilibrium, we would have
640980	646940	to take the root mean square of three and five.
646940	651620	We looked at multiple different scenarios to use different kinds of means.
651620	655700	Notice how as alpha grows bigger, the mean takes more weight of the bigger value, which
655700	657900	is five.
657900	662460	So from these four examples, the harmonic mean is the smallest and the quadratic mean
662460	665380	is the biggest.
665380	668460	There are two more averages that are very commonly used.
668460	671380	How much does an average American make per year?
671380	676060	And since there are ridiculous outliers, like billionaires which would skew the arithmetic
676060	683220	mean too far to the right, and zero income people which would make geometric mean zero.
683220	687500	Instead of any of the generalized means, we typically take the median in practice, which
687500	689300	is the middle number.
689300	694020	And it is a pretty good representative of how much an average person makes.
694020	697180	And another commonly used average is the mode.
697180	703700	So when we say an average American owns a smartphone, we probably mean most Americans.
703700	708180	And the majority is a pretty good representative of an average person.
708180	716420	Now, we have a solid notion of what an average is, so we are ready to take the first step.
716420	721900	Each time we win, we gain t times r, so it is same as multiplying 1 plus tr to how much
721900	723740	money we have.
723740	730700	This essentially is the same as 30% gain really meaning 130% the original amount.
730700	735860	And we can come up with something similar for each time we lose.
735860	741100	Suppose we win k times out of n games, then we will lose n minus k games.
741100	745980	I will call this big R for the total return, and we would want to multiply this to the
745980	750140	initial capital to see how much money we have after n games.
750140	754620	And for this expression, I want to use the convention that 0 to the power of 0 is equal
754620	761700	to 1, which sounds like a nonsense, but suppose you all in each play, and if you get lucky,
761700	766740	you have multiplied your money n times by the factor of 1 plus tr.
766740	771260	And if you get unlucky just once, then you lost all your money.
771260	776340	So to make sense out of this situation, we will choose to define that 0 to the 0 is equal
776340	778960	to 1 for this expression.
778960	784800	Of course we can treat this rigorously with limits, but we just want a model that works.
784800	789760	Now we are expected to win about n times p games where p is the probability of winning
789760	794320	1 game, and we are to lose about n times q games.
794320	798240	So this is the average total return right?
798240	804200	Earlier we have talked about all the different types of averages, and which one is this one?
804200	808880	Well, to really make sense out of this, we need to introduce a new toolkit called random
808880	811520	variables.
811520	815360	Consider a scenario where you toss an unfair coin 3 times.
815360	820080	There are 8 different events possible, and we can calculate the probability of each event
820080	825240	by multiplication since each throw is independent.
825240	829840	Then we can come up with a random variable for the total number of heads.
829840	835680	So x of the event hht would be 2.
835680	838720	This example illustrates what a random variable is.
838720	843800	It simply is a function that takes an event and assigns a numerical value.
843800	849320	And by doing so, we turn the raw non-numerical data such as sequence of heads and tails into
849320	852840	numerical data, and it is much easier to work with.
852840	858240	Well, that is the more modern interpretation, but before the rise of set theory and measure
858240	862520	theory, mathematicians nively thought of it as a variable that can take on the values
862520	864480	of a random event.
864480	870880	And for this scenario, x can take on the values 0, 1, 2, and 3.
870880	876320	And in either perspective, we can calculate the probability of x equaling 2 by adding
876320	880360	probabilities of all possible ways of 2 heads showing up.
880360	883020	And we could do this similar for 3.
883020	888200	But what's the probability of 7 heads showing up out of 3 toss?
888200	892960	That's just impossible, so the probability is 0.
892960	897800	Now we can plot the probability for each values of the random variable, and we call
897800	902280	this the probability mass function.
902280	906880	This is one very specific example of a class of random variables that we call binomial
906880	908680	random variable.
908680	913880	Denoted b with two parameter n for the number of trials and p for the probability of winning
913880	920680	one trial, and we can just write b when the context is clear.
920680	928340	And since b represents the number of wins, it can take on the values from 0 to n.
928340	932840	How do we calculate the probability of getting two wins out of four trials if the probability
932840	934760	of winning is one-third?
934760	939640	Well, there are six different ways you can win twice, and each of these events have a
939640	943400	probability of one-third squared times two-third squared.
943400	948560	And we can get six by taking four choose two.
948560	954640	So doing the very same thing in general, the probability of b equaling k is n choose k
954640	960480	times p to the k times q to the n minus k, where q is one minus p.
960480	965840	Next, I want to come up with the notion of the arithmetic mean for random variables and
965840	970320	how it compares with the arithmetic mean of a statistical data set.
970320	976920	So let's say there are 10,000 independent experiments, each consisting of 10 dice throws.
976920	981960	And for each experiment, we want to count the number of times six shows up.
981960	986440	We can create a histogram to tally up the results, and we can see that it is fairly
986440	991760	common to see six showing up one or two times, but getting ten sixes in a row is practically
991760	994360	impossible.
994360	998600	The probability model that represents one instance of the experiment is the binomial
998600	1003880	distribution of ten trials and the probability of winning equaling one-six.
1003880	1008320	And if we plot the probability mass function, the shape is essentially identical to the
1008320	1013120	histogram because as long as the number of experiments is large enough, the number of
1013120	1017760	experiments where three-sixes came up out of the total number of experiments should
1017760	1022680	approximately equal the probability of three-sixes showing up in a single experiment.
1022680	1026320	And this holds for any other values as well.
1026320	1031360	So we can define the expected value, which is the probability equivalent of the arithmetic
1031360	1036940	mean by summing over the product of the value of the random variable times the probability
1036940	1038840	of getting that value.
1038840	1043160	And as long as the number of experiments are large enough, the arithmetic mean approaches
1043160	1045240	the expected value.
1045240	1049800	Now, what is the expected value of the binomial distribution?
1049800	1055600	Well, this summation is fairly tricky to compute, so for those of you that are interested,
1055600	1059400	I will leave a link in the description below for the derivation.
1059400	1064680	So for now, let's take a small leap of faith and say it equals n times p.
1064680	1069320	And it is a reasonable answer that agrees with our intuition since if we toss a coin
1069320	1072480	hundred times, we expect about fifty heads.
1072480	1078040	And if we toss a dice sixty times, we expect about ten ones.
1078040	1082600	It should be clear now that we need to construct a random variable that depends on the binomial
1082600	1084840	distribution for our problem.
1084840	1090640	So now we introduce how transformation of random variables work.
1090640	1095280	Suppose that x is a random variable that can take on the four values negative one, zero,
1095280	1100520	one, and two, with each value having some probability.
1100520	1106320	Then y to find as one over x can take on the reciprocals of the values of x.
1106320	1111440	And the probabilities of each value of y is same as the probabilities of getting the corresponding
1111440	1112440	x.
1112440	1117920	So as an example, if we are trying to find the probability of y equaling one half, first
1117920	1122680	substitute y for one over x, then solve for x.
1122680	1127200	Notice how the plot of the probability mass function of y is out of order.
1127200	1132720	So we just have to rearrange it to make it more intuitive to read.
1132720	1136280	Now what if the transformation is not one to one?
1136280	1140000	For example, consider the square transformation.
1140000	1144720	Then y can only take on three values since both positive and negative one squared equals
1144720	1146280	one.
1146280	1152480	So if we are trying to calculate the probability of y equaling one, y is equal to x squared,
1152480	1160360	and there are two possible values of x squared equaling one, so we have to add the two probabilities.
1160360	1165000	So we have to redraw the PMF by merging the two values.
1165000	1170000	This essentially is how transformations of all discrete random variables work.
1170000	1173760	Now, how do we find the expected value of y?
1173760	1178640	We can just use the definition of the expected value of y, which is the sum over all values
1178640	1183080	of y times the probability of getting that value.
1183080	1188280	We can instead just sum over all possible values of x squared times the probability of getting
1188280	1190360	each value of x.
1190360	1197040	And during the summation, values that were not one to one will appropriately add together.
1197040	1201680	This essentially illustrates the proof of the discrete version of the law of the unconscious
1201680	1207080	statistician, which is often called lotus, which is its acronym, and it is one of the
1207080	1210600	most important theorems in probability theory.
1210600	1215440	This theorem is significant since we can find the expected value of a transform distribution
1215440	1219080	without knowing anything about the transform distribution.
1219760	1225720	Now, we are ready to formally define r, the total return, as a random variable that depends
1225720	1228400	on the binomial distribution.
1228400	1233360	And this makes sense since b is a random variable that takes on the number of wins.
1233360	1240760	And we want to repeatedly multiply 1 plus tr for each win and 1 minus sr for each loss.
1240760	1245480	Let's try taking the expected value and see what happens.
1245480	1249760	And we can use the lotus to evaluate the expected value.
1249760	1255680	At this point, the summation looked too nasty, so I evaluated it using Wolfram Mathematica.
1255680	1260320	So kudos to you if you can try and simplify it by hand.
1260320	1267200	At this point, it's probably good to stop and think about what this means.
1267200	1272000	In the very beginning, we informally introduced the random variable g to denote the net gain
1272000	1274040	per single play.
1274040	1279200	And we also calculated the expected value of net change per single play.
1279200	1285680	So we can make the substitution for the expected value of the total return.
1285680	1291400	This expression intuitively makes sense as if we have a net change of e of g per play,
1291400	1297240	then we are on average multiplying by 1 plus e of g per play.
1297240	1301880	And this expression is maximized if we take the little r, which is the risk, to be as
1301880	1304240	big as possible.
1304240	1308640	It's not too hard to see that maximizing the expected value is not the best strategy.
1308640	1313360	But to provide a concrete example, suppose there is a game where you flip a fair coin
1313360	1319280	and if you flip head, you quadruple your risk and if you flip tail, you lose your wager.
1319280	1323800	And if we take the strategy to maximize the expected value of the total return, the only
1323800	1329160	way we can win is to consecutively flip heads and if we flip just one tail, we lose all
1329160	1330880	of our money.
1330880	1335520	As the number of trials get larger, your chance of becoming rich approaches zero exponentially
1335520	1342200	fast and you are almost certainly guaranteed to lose everything.
1342200	1344880	Maximizing the expected value was not the best choice.
1344880	1349120	So what if we maximize the median instead?
1349120	1354240	For continuous distribution, the definition of median is obvious, which is the value that
1354240	1356880	splits the probability into two halves.
1356880	1362200	But we need a more general definition that works for discrete random variable as well.
1362200	1367880	So the definition that we will use for median is any real value m such that the probability
1367880	1373580	of x less than or equal to m is at least half and probability x is greater than or equal
1373580	1375780	to m is at least half.
1375780	1380520	So if we look at this binomial distribution x, the total probability less than or equal
1380520	1385240	to two is more than half and the probability greater than or equal to two is also more
1385240	1386740	than half.
1386740	1391420	So for this distribution, the median is equal to two.
1391420	1396300	Let's take a look at another binomial distribution which happens to be symmetric and bimodal
1396300	1400940	and the total probability less than or equal to two and greater than or equal to two is
1400940	1402380	at least half.
1402380	1407900	So two is the median of this distribution and by the same reasoning, three is a median
1407900	1413940	as well and if we take any number in between two and three such as 2.5 that satisfies the
1413940	1416780	definition of median two.
1416780	1422780	So for this case, the median is the set of closed interval from two to three.
1422780	1427020	Then what is the median of a binomial distribution?
1427020	1431340	It is the expected value rounded to the nearest integer.
1431340	1434100	Well, that was a lie.
1434100	1439340	We don't actually have a closed formula to find the median in terms of NMP but we do
1439340	1441540	know a few things about it.
1441540	1447420	And one thing for sure is that median could either take on Np rounded up or down or maybe
1447420	1449980	both at the same time.
1449980	1454220	This isn't something we could prove quickly but I want to provide an intuition for big
1454220	1459700	values of N since we are interested in long term winning strategy.
1459700	1464540	So for large values of N, the binomial distribution starts to look more and more like the bell
1464540	1470580	curve so the mean and the median should roughly be equal to each other but since b can only
1470580	1474740	take on integer values so does the median.
1474740	1479540	For rest of the video, we will just approximate that the median of the binomial distribution
1479540	1483540	is roughly equal to the mean.
1483540	1487780	Now how do we compute the median of a transform distribution?
1487780	1494380	For example, if we have some distribution x and if we apply a power to it, the probability
1494380	1499060	mass function essentially looks the same since there was no rearrangement in the ordering
1499060	1504700	of each bars so the median would be represented by the same bar on the left and the right
1504700	1510020	so the median of the transform is the same as transform of the median.
1510020	1517380	Now what if we apply a monotonically decreasing transformation like 2 to the negative x?
1517380	1523780	Then the ordering completely flips but the middle is still the middle so the median commutes
1523780	1528300	with the transformation for this case as well.
1528300	1532700	But if we have a transformation that is not strictly increasing like the integer part
1532700	1539220	of x divided by 3, I marked where the original median was with the blue arrow and since this
1539220	1547300	function is not 1 to 1, we would have to merge the bars together.
1547300	1553060	Since 4 was the original median, everything up to 4 is at least half so everything up
1553060	1556940	to 5 is at least half as well.
1556940	1561820	And everything down to 4 is at least half so everything down to 3 is at least half as
1561820	1562940	well.
1562940	1569580	So 1 which is the transform of 4 is the median of the new distribution.
1569580	1574480	So we can just find the median of a transform by taking the transform of the median as long
1574480	1581300	as g is a monotonic function, whether it's increasing or decreasing, strict or not.
1581300	1585020	So can we find the median of the total return?
1585020	1591700	We can write the transformation as a single exponent function.
1591700	1596860	And if the base of the exponent is greater than 1, it is increasing.
1596860	1604440	If it's equal to 1 then it is constant and if it's in between 0 and 1 then it is decreasing.
1604440	1609620	If the base is 0 or negative, we run into some issues with the monotonicity.
1609620	1616740	So if we restrict both the numerator 1 plus tr and the denominator 1 minus sr to be positive,
1616740	1620900	we get a restriction of allowed range per r.
1620900	1625940	Intuitively 1 over s is the maximum possible risk that we can take, which is equivalent
1625940	1627780	to all in.
1627780	1631740	But what does negative 1 over t signify?
1631740	1635540	That actually is the maximum risk that we can possibly take if we are taking the short
1635540	1637160	position.
1637160	1640020	So now we have a reasonable range for r.
1640020	1644580	And within this range, the transformation is monotonic so we can compute the median
1644580	1650680	of big r by taking the transformation of the median of the binomial distribution.
1650680	1654260	Then median can be approximated by np.
1654260	1660040	So after some manipulation, we arrive at this expression.
1660040	1664760	And we can think of this as a single variable function of the risk since other variables
1664760	1667140	are fixed parameters.
1667140	1672780	So this allows us to do some single variable differential calculus.
1672780	1677260	1 over s and negative 1 over t are the roots of this function.
1677260	1681320	So if we graph this function with respect to the risk, it looks something like an upside
1681320	1684420	down parabola with a single maximum.
1684420	1688920	I normalize the graph so that the peak is always at the same height since it is really
1688920	1691080	what we want to know about.
1691080	1697120	So if we vary the value of p, the probability of winning, the location of the maximum changes.
1697360	1701880	But if we change the value of n, the shape of the graph changes but where the maximum
1701880	1703760	is does not.
1703760	1707560	And this illustrates one of the key techniques in calculus.
1707560	1711680	Instead of finding the maximum of the original function, we can instead find the maximum
1711680	1715800	of a transform function as long as the transform is monotonic.
1715800	1720600	And we can take natural log as well which is a monotonic function since it splits products
1720600	1724520	into sums and it makes calculus so much easier.
1724520	1729520	Now let's take the derivative which turns logs into reciprocals and we have to pull
1729520	1732640	out the coefficient by chain rule.
1732640	1738240	And we set it equal to 0 in order to find that single maximum.
1738240	1743360	At this point, all the heavy lifting is done so I will leave it to you to solve for r and
1743360	1749880	get that r that maximizes the median is indeed the Kelly's formula.
1749880	1752840	We computed the optimal risk for mean and median.
1752840	1757160	So we might as well try the mode since those three are the averages you learn in elementary
1757160	1759120	school statistics.
1759120	1763960	And unlike median, mode is fairly intuitive to define for random variables.
1763960	1770080	It simply is the value that gives the biggest probability and there can be multiple modes.
1770080	1774640	Then what is the mode of a binomial distribution?
1774640	1778880	Unlike the median, there is a closed formula in terms of NMP.
1778880	1784640	But this is a bit of overkill and just like median, we will say that the mode is an integer
1784640	1791560	value close to the expected value and we can approximate it using the expected value.
1791560	1795560	Then what is the mode of a transformed random variable?
1795560	1800480	If we simply take a discrete random variable and permute the values, then the biggest bar
1800480	1802240	is still preserved.
1802240	1807960	But if we merge some bars, what was originally the biggest may not be the new biggest.
1807960	1813320	So one condition where mode commutes with G is that G is one to one.
1813320	1818160	By the way, this only holds for discrete random variables and fails for continuous random
1818160	1819840	variables in general.
1819840	1823920	So if you can come up with an example, leave it in the comments below.
1823920	1827200	Now what if we stack all the bars into one?
1827200	1830680	That is, the transformation is a constant function.
1830680	1835400	Then every single value, including what was originally the mode transformed into the new
1835400	1836480	mode.
1836480	1840240	So mode commutes with G if G is a constant function.
1840240	1844680	I'm sure there are more interesting examples, but these two conditions are the ones we will
1844680	1849040	be using.
1849040	1854040	Just like how we did for median, the exponential function is either one to one or constant
1854040	1857360	as long as the base of the exponent is greater than zero.
1857360	1860800	And we found the appropriate conditions.
1860800	1864320	So mode of the transform is transform of the mode.
1864320	1870320	So it will simplify the exact same value that median came out to.
1870320	1878720	So once we find the R that maximizes the mode, we will get Kelly's formula once again.
1878720	1883360	If we plot the probability mass function of the binomial distribution, it looks roughly
1883360	1884480	normal.
1884480	1889400	But if we transform it to the total return, the ordering is preserved but the shape gets
1889400	1890800	skewed.
1890800	1895840	But if we instead plot this on a log scale, the shape becomes normal again.
1895840	1900040	By the way, the choice of the base being 5 was completely arbitrary in terms of the
1900040	1905160	shape that it gives, it just happened to give me the best picture.
1905160	1910560	So this raises suspicion that there is an exponential or multiplicative behavior lurking
1910560	1912160	in the background.
1912160	1916200	So we should try taking the geometric mean.
1916200	1920080	Just like how we defined the arithmetic mean for a random variable, we can generalize
1920080	1922480	this for any mean.
1922480	1927920	But things get pretty tricky if we send alpha to zero.
1927920	1932480	And for the case of sample geometric mean, the limit approach the product of each data
1932480	1935120	then taking the nth root.
1935120	1939800	Now we will take a natural log on both sides since the power drops as the coefficient and
1939800	1942840	product splits into sum.
1942840	1947520	And once we exponentiate both sides, we have an alternative formula for geometric mean
1947520	1949760	that does not have product in it.
1949760	1954240	In fact, this looks much closer to the generalized formula above compared to the formula that
1954240	1955920	involves the product.
1955920	1961240	So it could be thought of as the missing link between the general form and the product form.
1961240	1965760	In any case, we will use this formula in a similar way to define the geometric mean for
1965760	1968760	a random variable.
1968760	1973400	Let's first compute the expected value of the log of r, which can be evaluated using
1973400	1975040	lotus.
1975040	1978680	Then we can drop the powers and split up the sum.
1978680	1983680	And by the linearity of summation, we can split up the sum into three separate summations
1983680	1990840	and pulling out things that does not involve k outside of the summation.
1990840	1995960	Notice how the circle part literally is the expected value of the binomial distribution.
1995960	2004680	And the one in the blue circle is sum of each probability which should add to one.
2004680	2008560	Now we can factor out like terms and make some substitutions.
2008560	2011600	And this should look awfully familiar.
2011600	2016200	Once we take the exponent to find the geometric mean, it comes out to exactly same expression
2016200	2018320	as the median and the mode.
2018320	2022720	And once again, we can derive the Kelly's formula from here.
2022720	2027720	I want to wrap it up with the final remark that provides an interpretation of the formula.
2027720	2031320	Since the geometric mean is supposed to be the multiplicative average, we can take the
2031320	2035560	nth root to find the average net game per single play.
2035560	2040880	If we win, we multiply by 1 plus tr to the principal capital, and if we lose, we multiply
2040880	2042880	by 1 minus sr.
2042880	2047760	So we can think of this as the average multiplier per single play.
2047760	2051640	And if we instead find the geometric mean of the total return for the binomial random
2051640	2054920	variable of one trial, we get this exact value as well.
