1. **Median and Mode of a Binomial Distribution**: The median of a binomial distribution is the value at which half of the probability mass lies to the left and half to the right. The mode is the value with the highest probability density; for a discrete uniform distribution, this is simply the expected value. For other distributions, the mode is the value that occurs most frequently.

2. **Transformation of Mode**: The mode of a transformed random variable can be determined by the transformed distribution if the transformation is one-to-one or constant. Specifically:
   - If the transformation is one-to-one, the mode of the original distribution remains unchanged.
   - If the transformation is constant (like a constant function), each value's mode transforms into the new mode.

3. **Mode Commutes with Transformation**: The mode of a transformed random variable commutes with the transformation if the transformation is either one-to-one or constant, especially for discrete random variables.

4. **Kelly's Formula and Mode**: Kelly's formula can be derived by finding the mode of the distribution of the logarithm of the total return in gambling, assuming a binomial distribution for a single game. The transformation used here is the exponential function, which is both one-to-one and constant (as long as the base is greater than zero).

5. **Geometric Mean and Mode**: The geometric mean provides a way to average multiplicative changes, not just additive ones. By taking the natural logarithm of the random variable and finding its expected value, then exponentiating, we can derive the mode of the distribution. This approach leads us back to Kelly's formula.

6. **Interpretation of Kelly's Formula**: The Kelly criterion gives us the average multiplier per single play in a gambling scenario where each play has two outcomes: win with probability `p` and lose with probability `1-p`. This average multiplier is the geometric mean of the probabilistic outcomes of a game.

In summary, the median, mode, and Kelly's formula are related concepts that can be interchanged under certain transformations, particularly when dealing with discrete random variables and multiplicative changes. The geometric mean provides a mathematical bridge that connects these concepts and leads us to derive Kelly's formula from the mode of the distribution of logarithmic returns.
