1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Suppose there is a game with the probability of winning of 1 third.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,080
And if you win, you will get 1.8 times the amount of money that you risk on the play.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,880
And if you lose, you lose the entire wager.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,200
Then, we can calculate the expected value of the payout by summing over all possible

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,460
events of the probability of each event times the payout of each event.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,400
And once we calculate the expected value for this game, it comes out to a negative value.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,200
You have no edge at all in this game, so you may get lucky first few times, but there is

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,640
no long-term winning strategy.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,000
So you will inevitably donate all your money to the house if you keep playing.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,080
Now let's consider a second game where if you win, you get paid the amount of money

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,160
you risk.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,740
Or in other words, you double your betting amount.

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,140
Suppose that you have a 100% chance of winning this game.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,740
And it doesn't quite matter what happens if you lose, since you are guaranteed to win.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,700
And you are expected to double your money each time you play the game.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,380
Then what is your long-term winning strategy?

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,580
Well, you essentially have a money printer, so you might as well put your entire life

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,700
savings on each play.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,820
Even better, you can maximize your profit by playing on a margin, meaning you should

20
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,140
borrow the biggest amount of money that you possibly can, and put all your assets, including

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,740
your kidney and liver, as a collateral for the margin.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,220
We looked at two extreme examples, one where you have no edge at all and there is no long-term

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,740
winning strategy, and another where you are guaranteed to win each time and your winning

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,780
strategy is to bet everything each time.

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,820
So the real interesting problem is, when your expected payout is positive, but you are not

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,580
guaranteed to win.

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,900
Let's take a look at one such example.

28
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,060
You should buy some S&P 500 index fund, which is a fund that takes top 500 American companies

29
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,180
and averages them by their company's value.

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,660
And let's say you implement a strategy to sell at a profit when the price doubles and

31
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,220
cut your losses when the price drops by 25%.

32
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,740
Taking the historical data starting from 2003 and back-testing this strategy, I calculated

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,420
that the probability of win is roughly 59%.

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,740
Because we are expected to win more, and each win pays much more than how much we lose

35
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,780
each loss, the expected payout per play obviously has to be a positive value.

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,020
This game definitely is worth playing, but how much should you risk each play?

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,180
One possible strategy commonly used by the members of the subreddit Wall Street Pets

38
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,100
is called Food Stamps or Lambo, which is a strategy to risk everything in order to maximize

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,900
your potential profit.

40
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,420
So for this strategy, we can maximize the expected value by maximizing the value of

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,300
R, so you take 4x leverage to risk everything you own.

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,860
Naively, that is the optimal strategy since you are maximizing the expected average profit.

43
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,660
You make it lucky first few times, but if you continue to all-in each play, you will

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,620
eventually lose everything.

45
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,300
The very act of maximizing expected payout actually leads to ruin.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,020
So there must be a better long-term strategy, right?

47
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,820
Let's start by defining the problem.

48
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,260
Suppose there is a game where you know the probability of winning, which we will call

49
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,860
P, and Q, the probability of losing, which equals 1-P.

50
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,060
The game is repeated N times, and each play you will risk a fixed percentage, R, of your

51
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,060
portfolio.

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,060
And each time you win, you will gain T times R, and each time you lose, you will lose S

53
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,820
times R.

54
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,540
And let's put on some auxiliary conditions.

55
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,380
The amount you can lose is at most your entire portfolio, so you cannot have a negative balance.

56
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,140
And you are not guaranteed to win.

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,620
And we want N to be sufficiently large since we are looking for our long-term sustainable

58
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,140
strategy.

59
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,740
So you are expected to win some and lose some, but still end up profitable in the long run.

60
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,700
Then what fraction of your portfolio should you risk each play to maximize the long-term

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,620
average profit?

62
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,060
You may have noticed how we are restricted to binary scenarios.

63
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,260
But in the real world, there are many games with more than two outcomes.

64
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,980
For example, the Powerball Lottery has 9 different ways you can win, each with different payout.

65
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,460
And you can't even have a game with a continuum of outcomes that depend on some continuous

66
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
distribution.

67
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,520
As interesting as those scenarios sound, they are too difficult to cover on a single video.

68
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,420
So for this video, we will focus only on binary outcomes.

69
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,180
Before we start solving the problem, I want to start with the answer so we can work our

70
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,980
way towards it.

71
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,260
So the optimal risk we should take per play is P, the probability of win, over S, the

72
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:08,820
percentage loss per loss, minus Q, the probability of loss, over T, the percentage gain per win.

73
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,820
The amount you should risk grows as the probability of win goes up, as the first term is linearly

74
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,700
proportional with respect to P. And the optimal risk also goes up as percentage gain per win

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,980
grows, since the second term is negative inversely proportional with respect to T.

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,780
This intuitively makes sense as an investment is considered better if you win more and each

77
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,260
time you win, you win more money.

78
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,660
Similarly, the optimal risk decreases as the probability of loss and the amount of loss

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,020
per loss goes up.

80
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,820
This formula is known as the Kelly Criterion.

81
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,380
It's best to look at some extreme cases of the formula.

82
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,940
So if we have a perfectly balanced game with equal chance of win and loss, and equal gain

83
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,900
and loss, the optimal risk is nothing, meaning this isn't a game worth playing.

84
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,040
If we instead have a game where you're less likely to win and your gain per win is less

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,020
than your losses, then your optimal R value comes out to negative.

86
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,300
What this means is that you don't want to be playing the game, but you want to be sitting

87
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,220
on the other side and taking a short position, being the casino or the insurance company

88
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,580
stealing money from you.

89
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,140
Now what if the game is extremely good in your favor?

90
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,260
Then your R value can come out to something bigger than one, meaning you should invest

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,020
not only your entire portfolio, but take a leverage and invest with borrowed money.

92
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,100
Notice how I put quotation marks around the word average.

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,940
The first question I want to ask is, what even is an average?

94
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,020
There is a generalized mathematical definition of the word, as mathematicians love to abstractify

95
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,260
everything.

96
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,940
But for now, we will just think of it as some measure of central tendency, or a good representative

97
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,460
element of a data set.

98
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,500
And the average that we are all very familiar with is the arithmetic mean, or sometimes

99
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,060
just call the mean when the context is clear.

100
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,620
And we compute it by adding up all the numbers in the data set and dividing by how many numbers

101
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,020
there are.

102
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,860
There is another kind of mean called the quadratic mean, or sometimes called root mean squared.

103
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,260
And we get it by taking the arithmetic mean of all the squares of numbers, then taking

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,620
the square root.

105
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,660
Another common mean that we use is called the harmonic mean, and we get it by taking

106
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,540
the arithmetic mean of all the reciprocals, then taking the reciprocal.

107
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,460
And using similar idea, we can extend the definition to work for all real numbers, except

108
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,340
for zero.

109
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,460
And even for zero, we can just take the limit as alpha goes to zero, to define the zero

110
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,740
mean, which is known as the geometric mean.

111
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,500
As alpha grows bigger, more weight is placed on bigger values.

112
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,220
And as alpha gets smaller, more weight is placed on smaller values.

113
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,420
So if we take the limit as alpha goes to negative infinity, we get the smallest value of the

114
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,100
data set.

115
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,900
And if we take the limit to the positive infinity, we get the maximum value.

116
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,100
Now when is it appropriate to use these different types of means?

117
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,660
One person having $3 and another person having $5.

118
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,660
If Karl Marx saw this, he would want to equally distribute wealth.

119
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,980
Then the most appropriate average would be the arithmetic mean.

120
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,780
Now, consider a second situation where you are a successful day trader and triple your

121
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,740
money the first year and five extra money the second year.

122
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,700
Then what is your average growth per year?

123
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,820
It is equivalent to roughly 3.873 xing your money each year.

124
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,260
So when we have a compound growth and want to calculate average growth, geometric mean

125
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,580
is the most appropriate.

126
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,820
Now consider the next situation where person A can finish a task in three days and person

127
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,420
B can finish a task in five days.

128
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,500
Then what is the average number of days it takes a person to finish the task?

129
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,300
If both of them are working on the task concurrently, we can add the rates together.

130
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,580
And we can divide by two to get the average rate.

131
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,420
So it means that person A can finish one third of a job per day and person B is working

132
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,580
at one fifth of a job per day.

133
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,340
Then it is equivalent as if each person was finishing four fifteen per day.

134
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,340
So on average, it takes fifteen over four days to finish a task.

135
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,460
And this is an appropriate situation to take the harmonic mean.

136
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,740
Now, consider the next scenario where there are two chambers filled with the same homogenous

137
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,340
ideal gas.

138
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,100
And each chamber contains the same amount of gas.

139
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Now, suppose the mean speed of the molecules in the left chamber is three and the right

140
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,140
chamber is five.

141
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,980
So the right chamber is a bit hotter.

142
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,340
Now once you connect the two chambers together, they will eventually reach a thermal equilibrium.

143
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,460
And the mean speed of the molecules on both sides of the chamber will eventually balance

144
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,580
out to a number between three and five.

145
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,540
So what is this average speed after mixing?

146
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,460
Well, we know that the temperature on the left and the right will eventually reach an

147
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,580
arithmetic mean.

148
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,820
And since temperature is, roughly speaking, the average kinetic energy of the molecules,

149
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,940
it is proportional to the square of the mean speed.

150
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,940
And for those of you who are curious what the constant of proportionality is, it is

151
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,860
pi times the mass of the air molecule, all over eight times the Boltzmann constant.

152
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,980
So now, to find the average mean velocity after the thermal equilibrium, we would have

153
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,940
to take the root mean square of three and five.

154
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,620
We looked at multiple different scenarios to use different kinds of means.

155
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,700
Notice how as alpha grows bigger, the mean takes more weight of the bigger value, which

156
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,900
is five.

157
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,460
So from these four examples, the harmonic mean is the smallest and the quadratic mean

158
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,380
is the biggest.

159
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,460
There are two more averages that are very commonly used.

160
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,380
How much does an average American make per year?

161
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,060
And since there are ridiculous outliers, like billionaires which would skew the arithmetic

162
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:23,220
mean too far to the right, and zero income people which would make geometric mean zero.

163
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,500
Instead of any of the generalized means, we typically take the median in practice, which

164
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,300
is the middle number.

165
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,020
And it is a pretty good representative of how much an average person makes.

166
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,180
And another commonly used average is the mode.

167
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:43,700
So when we say an average American owns a smartphone, we probably mean most Americans.

168
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,180
And the majority is a pretty good representative of an average person.

169
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:56,420
Now, we have a solid notion of what an average is, so we are ready to take the first step.

170
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,900
Each time we win, we gain t times r, so it is same as multiplying 1 plus tr to how much

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,740
money we have.

172
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:10,700
This essentially is the same as 30% gain really meaning 130% the original amount.

173
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,860
And we can come up with something similar for each time we lose.

174
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,100
Suppose we win k times out of n games, then we will lose n minus k games.

175
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,980
I will call this big R for the total return, and we would want to multiply this to the

176
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,140
initial capital to see how much money we have after n games.

177
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,620
And for this expression, I want to use the convention that 0 to the power of 0 is equal

178
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,700
to 1, which sounds like a nonsense, but suppose you all in each play, and if you get lucky,

179
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,740
you have multiplied your money n times by the factor of 1 plus tr.

180
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,260
And if you get unlucky just once, then you lost all your money.

181
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,340
So to make sense out of this situation, we will choose to define that 0 to the 0 is equal

182
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,960
to 1 for this expression.

183
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Of course we can treat this rigorously with limits, but we just want a model that works.

184
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Now we are expected to win about n times p games where p is the probability of winning

185
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,320
1 game, and we are to lose about n times q games.

186
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,240
So this is the average total return right?

187
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,200
Earlier we have talked about all the different types of averages, and which one is this one?

188
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,880
Well, to really make sense out of this, we need to introduce a new toolkit called random

189
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,520
variables.

190
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,360
Consider a scenario where you toss an unfair coin 3 times.

191
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,080
There are 8 different events possible, and we can calculate the probability of each event

192
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,240
by multiplication since each throw is independent.

193
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,840
Then we can come up with a random variable for the total number of heads.

194
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,680
So x of the event hht would be 2.

195
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,720
This example illustrates what a random variable is.

196
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,800
It simply is a function that takes an event and assigns a numerical value.

197
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,320
And by doing so, we turn the raw non-numerical data such as sequence of heads and tails into

198
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,840
numerical data, and it is much easier to work with.

199
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,240
Well, that is the more modern interpretation, but before the rise of set theory and measure

200
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,520
theory, mathematicians nively thought of it as a variable that can take on the values

201
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,480
of a random event.

202
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,880
And for this scenario, x can take on the values 0, 1, 2, and 3.

203
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,320
And in either perspective, we can calculate the probability of x equaling 2 by adding

204
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,360
probabilities of all possible ways of 2 heads showing up.

205
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,020
And we could do this similar for 3.

206
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,200
But what's the probability of 7 heads showing up out of 3 toss?

207
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,960
That's just impossible, so the probability is 0.

208
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,800
Now we can plot the probability for each values of the random variable, and we call

209
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,280
this the probability mass function.

210
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,880
This is one very specific example of a class of random variables that we call binomial

211
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,680
random variable.

212
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,880
Denoted b with two parameter n for the number of trials and p for the probability of winning

213
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,680
one trial, and we can just write b when the context is clear.

214
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,340
And since b represents the number of wins, it can take on the values from 0 to n.

215
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,840
How do we calculate the probability of getting two wins out of four trials if the probability

216
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,760
of winning is one-third?

217
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,640
Well, there are six different ways you can win twice, and each of these events have a

218
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,400
probability of one-third squared times two-third squared.

219
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,560
And we can get six by taking four choose two.

220
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,640
So doing the very same thing in general, the probability of b equaling k is n choose k

221
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,480
times p to the k times q to the n minus k, where q is one minus p.

222
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,840
Next, I want to come up with the notion of the arithmetic mean for random variables and

223
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,320
how it compares with the arithmetic mean of a statistical data set.

224
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,920
So let's say there are 10,000 independent experiments, each consisting of 10 dice throws.

225
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,960
And for each experiment, we want to count the number of times six shows up.

226
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,440
We can create a histogram to tally up the results, and we can see that it is fairly

227
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,760
common to see six showing up one or two times, but getting ten sixes in a row is practically

228
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,360
impossible.

229
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,600
The probability model that represents one instance of the experiment is the binomial

230
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,880
distribution of ten trials and the probability of winning equaling one-six.

231
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,320
And if we plot the probability mass function, the shape is essentially identical to the

232
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,120
histogram because as long as the number of experiments is large enough, the number of

233
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,760
experiments where three-sixes came up out of the total number of experiments should

234
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,680
approximately equal the probability of three-sixes showing up in a single experiment.

235
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,320
And this holds for any other values as well.

236
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,360
So we can define the expected value, which is the probability equivalent of the arithmetic

237
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,940
mean by summing over the product of the value of the random variable times the probability

238
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,840
of getting that value.

239
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,160
And as long as the number of experiments are large enough, the arithmetic mean approaches

240
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,240
the expected value.

241
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,800
Now, what is the expected value of the binomial distribution?

242
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,600
Well, this summation is fairly tricky to compute, so for those of you that are interested,

243
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,400
I will leave a link in the description below for the derivation.

244
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,680
So for now, let's take a small leap of faith and say it equals n times p.

245
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,320
And it is a reasonable answer that agrees with our intuition since if we toss a coin

246
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,480
hundred times, we expect about fifty heads.

247
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,040
And if we toss a dice sixty times, we expect about ten ones.

248
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,600
It should be clear now that we need to construct a random variable that depends on the binomial

249
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,840
distribution for our problem.

250
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,640
So now we introduce how transformation of random variables work.

251
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,280
Suppose that x is a random variable that can take on the four values negative one, zero,

252
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,520
one, and two, with each value having some probability.

253
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,320
Then y to find as one over x can take on the reciprocals of the values of x.

254
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,440
And the probabilities of each value of y is same as the probabilities of getting the corresponding

255
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
x.

256
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,920
So as an example, if we are trying to find the probability of y equaling one half, first

257
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,680
substitute y for one over x, then solve for x.

258
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,200
Notice how the plot of the probability mass function of y is out of order.

259
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,720
So we just have to rearrange it to make it more intuitive to read.

260
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,280
Now what if the transformation is not one to one?

261
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,000
For example, consider the square transformation.

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
Then y can only take on three values since both positive and negative one squared equals

263
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,280
one.

264
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,480
So if we are trying to calculate the probability of y equaling one, y is equal to x squared,

265
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:20,360
and there are two possible values of x squared equaling one, so we have to add the two probabilities.

266
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,000
So we have to redraw the PMF by merging the two values.

267
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This essentially is how transformations of all discrete random variables work.

268
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,760
Now, how do we find the expected value of y?

269
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,640
We can just use the definition of the expected value of y, which is the sum over all values

270
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,080
of y times the probability of getting that value.

271
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,280
We can instead just sum over all possible values of x squared times the probability of getting

272
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,360
each value of x.

273
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:57,040
And during the summation, values that were not one to one will appropriately add together.

274
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,680
This essentially illustrates the proof of the discrete version of the law of the unconscious

275
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,080
statistician, which is often called lotus, which is its acronym, and it is one of the

276
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,600
most important theorems in probability theory.

277
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,440
This theorem is significant since we can find the expected value of a transform distribution

278
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,080
without knowing anything about the transform distribution.

279
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,720
Now, we are ready to formally define r, the total return, as a random variable that depends

280
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,400
on the binomial distribution.

281
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,360
And this makes sense since b is a random variable that takes on the number of wins.

282
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:40,760
And we want to repeatedly multiply 1 plus tr for each win and 1 minus sr for each loss.

283
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,480
Let's try taking the expected value and see what happens.

284
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,760
And we can use the lotus to evaluate the expected value.

285
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,680
At this point, the summation looked too nasty, so I evaluated it using Wolfram Mathematica.

286
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,320
So kudos to you if you can try and simplify it by hand.

287
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:07,200
At this point, it's probably good to stop and think about what this means.

288
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,000
In the very beginning, we informally introduced the random variable g to denote the net gain

289
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,040
per single play.

290
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,200
And we also calculated the expected value of net change per single play.

291
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,680
So we can make the substitution for the expected value of the total return.

292
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,400
This expression intuitively makes sense as if we have a net change of e of g per play,

293
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,240
then we are on average multiplying by 1 plus e of g per play.

294
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,880
And this expression is maximized if we take the little r, which is the risk, to be as

295
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,240
big as possible.

296
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
It's not too hard to see that maximizing the expected value is not the best strategy.

297
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,360
But to provide a concrete example, suppose there is a game where you flip a fair coin

298
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,280
and if you flip head, you quadruple your risk and if you flip tail, you lose your wager.

299
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,800
And if we take the strategy to maximize the expected value of the total return, the only

300
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,160
way we can win is to consecutively flip heads and if we flip just one tail, we lose all

301
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,880
of our money.

302
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,520
As the number of trials get larger, your chance of becoming rich approaches zero exponentially

303
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,200
fast and you are almost certainly guaranteed to lose everything.

304
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,880
Maximizing the expected value was not the best choice.

305
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,120
So what if we maximize the median instead?

306
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,240
For continuous distribution, the definition of median is obvious, which is the value that

307
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,880
splits the probability into two halves.

308
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,200
But we need a more general definition that works for discrete random variable as well.

309
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,880
So the definition that we will use for median is any real value m such that the probability

310
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,580
of x less than or equal to m is at least half and probability x is greater than or equal

311
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,780
to m is at least half.

312
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,520
So if we look at this binomial distribution x, the total probability less than or equal

313
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,240
to two is more than half and the probability greater than or equal to two is also more

314
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,740
than half.

315
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,420
So for this distribution, the median is equal to two.

316
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:16,300
Let's take a look at another binomial distribution which happens to be symmetric and bimodal

317
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,940
and the total probability less than or equal to two and greater than or equal to two is

318
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,380
at least half.

319
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,900
So two is the median of this distribution and by the same reasoning, three is a median

320
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,940
as well and if we take any number in between two and three such as 2.5 that satisfies the

321
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,780
definition of median two.

322
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,780
So for this case, the median is the set of closed interval from two to three.

323
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,020
Then what is the median of a binomial distribution?

324
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,340
It is the expected value rounded to the nearest integer.

325
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,100
Well, that was a lie.

326
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,340
We don't actually have a closed formula to find the median in terms of NMP but we do

327
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,540
know a few things about it.

328
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,420
And one thing for sure is that median could either take on Np rounded up or down or maybe

329
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,980
both at the same time.

330
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,220
This isn't something we could prove quickly but I want to provide an intuition for big

331
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,700
values of N since we are interested in long term winning strategy.

332
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,540
So for large values of N, the binomial distribution starts to look more and more like the bell

333
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:30,580
curve so the mean and the median should roughly be equal to each other but since b can only

334
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,740
take on integer values so does the median.

335
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,540
For rest of the video, we will just approximate that the median of the binomial distribution

336
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,540
is roughly equal to the mean.

337
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,780
Now how do we compute the median of a transform distribution?

338
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:54,380
For example, if we have some distribution x and if we apply a power to it, the probability

339
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,060
mass function essentially looks the same since there was no rearrangement in the ordering

340
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,700
of each bars so the median would be represented by the same bar on the left and the right

341
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,020
so the median of the transform is the same as transform of the median.

342
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:17,380
Now what if we apply a monotonically decreasing transformation like 2 to the negative x?

343
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:23,780
Then the ordering completely flips but the middle is still the middle so the median commutes

344
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,300
with the transformation for this case as well.

345
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,700
But if we have a transformation that is not strictly increasing like the integer part

346
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:39,220
of x divided by 3, I marked where the original median was with the blue arrow and since this

347
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:47,300
function is not 1 to 1, we would have to merge the bars together.

348
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,060
Since 4 was the original median, everything up to 4 is at least half so everything up

349
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,940
to 5 is at least half as well.

350
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,820
And everything down to 4 is at least half so everything down to 3 is at least half as

351
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,940
well.

352
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:09,580
So 1 which is the transform of 4 is the median of the new distribution.

353
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,480
So we can just find the median of a transform by taking the transform of the median as long

354
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,300
as g is a monotonic function, whether it's increasing or decreasing, strict or not.

355
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,020
So can we find the median of the total return?

356
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:31,700
We can write the transformation as a single exponent function.

357
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,860
And if the base of the exponent is greater than 1, it is increasing.

358
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:44,440
If it's equal to 1 then it is constant and if it's in between 0 and 1 then it is decreasing.

359
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,620
If the base is 0 or negative, we run into some issues with the monotonicity.

360
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:56,740
So if we restrict both the numerator 1 plus tr and the denominator 1 minus sr to be positive,

361
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,900
we get a restriction of allowed range per r.

362
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,940
Intuitively 1 over s is the maximum possible risk that we can take, which is equivalent

363
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,780
to all in.

364
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,740
But what does negative 1 over t signify?

365
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,540
That actually is the maximum risk that we can possibly take if we are taking the short

366
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,160
position.

367
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,020
So now we have a reasonable range for r.

368
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,580
And within this range, the transformation is monotonic so we can compute the median

369
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,680
of big r by taking the transformation of the median of the binomial distribution.

370
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,260
Then median can be approximated by np.

371
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,040
So after some manipulation, we arrive at this expression.

372
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,760
And we can think of this as a single variable function of the risk since other variables

373
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,140
are fixed parameters.

374
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,780
So this allows us to do some single variable differential calculus.

375
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,260
1 over s and negative 1 over t are the roots of this function.

376
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,320
So if we graph this function with respect to the risk, it looks something like an upside

377
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,420
down parabola with a single maximum.

378
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,920
I normalize the graph so that the peak is always at the same height since it is really

379
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,080
what we want to know about.

380
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,120
So if we vary the value of p, the probability of winning, the location of the maximum changes.

381
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,880
But if we change the value of n, the shape of the graph changes but where the maximum

382
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,760
is does not.

383
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,560
And this illustrates one of the key techniques in calculus.

384
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,680
Instead of finding the maximum of the original function, we can instead find the maximum

385
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,800
of a transform function as long as the transform is monotonic.

386
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,600
And we can take natural log as well which is a monotonic function since it splits products

387
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,520
into sums and it makes calculus so much easier.

388
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Now let's take the derivative which turns logs into reciprocals and we have to pull

389
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,640
out the coefficient by chain rule.

390
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,240
And we set it equal to 0 in order to find that single maximum.

391
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,360
At this point, all the heavy lifting is done so I will leave it to you to solve for r and

392
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,880
get that r that maximizes the median is indeed the Kelly's formula.

393
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,840
We computed the optimal risk for mean and median.

394
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,160
So we might as well try the mode since those three are the averages you learn in elementary

395
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,120
school statistics.

396
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,960
And unlike median, mode is fairly intuitive to define for random variables.

397
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,080
It simply is the value that gives the biggest probability and there can be multiple modes.

398
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,640
Then what is the mode of a binomial distribution?

399
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,880
Unlike the median, there is a closed formula in terms of NMP.

400
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,640
But this is a bit of overkill and just like median, we will say that the mode is an integer

401
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,560
value close to the expected value and we can approximate it using the expected value.

402
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Then what is the mode of a transformed random variable?

403
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,480
If we simply take a discrete random variable and permute the values, then the biggest bar

404
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
is still preserved.

405
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,960
But if we merge some bars, what was originally the biggest may not be the new biggest.

406
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,320
So one condition where mode commutes with G is that G is one to one.

407
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,160
By the way, this only holds for discrete random variables and fails for continuous random

408
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,840
variables in general.

409
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,920
So if you can come up with an example, leave it in the comments below.

410
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,200
Now what if we stack all the bars into one?

411
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,680
That is, the transformation is a constant function.

412
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,400
Then every single value, including what was originally the mode transformed into the new

413
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,480
mode.

414
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,240
So mode commutes with G if G is a constant function.

415
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,680
I'm sure there are more interesting examples, but these two conditions are the ones we will

416
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,040
be using.

417
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Just like how we did for median, the exponential function is either one to one or constant

418
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,360
as long as the base of the exponent is greater than zero.

419
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,800
And we found the appropriate conditions.

420
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,320
So mode of the transform is transform of the mode.

421
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,320
So it will simplify the exact same value that median came out to.

422
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:18,720
So once we find the R that maximizes the mode, we will get Kelly's formula once again.

423
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,360
If we plot the probability mass function of the binomial distribution, it looks roughly

424
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,480
normal.

425
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,400
But if we transform it to the total return, the ordering is preserved but the shape gets

426
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,800
skewed.

427
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,840
But if we instead plot this on a log scale, the shape becomes normal again.

428
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,040
By the way, the choice of the base being 5 was completely arbitrary in terms of the

429
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,160
shape that it gives, it just happened to give me the best picture.

430
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,560
So this raises suspicion that there is an exponential or multiplicative behavior lurking

431
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,160
in the background.

432
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,200
So we should try taking the geometric mean.

433
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,080
Just like how we defined the arithmetic mean for a random variable, we can generalize

434
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,480
this for any mean.

435
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,920
But things get pretty tricky if we send alpha to zero.

436
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,480
And for the case of sample geometric mean, the limit approach the product of each data

437
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,120
then taking the nth root.

438
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,800
Now we will take a natural log on both sides since the power drops as the coefficient and

439
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,840
product splits into sum.

440
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,520
And once we exponentiate both sides, we have an alternative formula for geometric mean

441
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,760
that does not have product in it.

442
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,240
In fact, this looks much closer to the generalized formula above compared to the formula that

443
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,920
involves the product.

444
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,240
So it could be thought of as the missing link between the general form and the product form.

445
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,760
In any case, we will use this formula in a similar way to define the geometric mean for

446
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
a random variable.

447
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,400
Let's first compute the expected value of the log of r, which can be evaluated using

448
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,040
lotus.

449
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,680
Then we can drop the powers and split up the sum.

450
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,680
And by the linearity of summation, we can split up the sum into three separate summations

451
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:10,840
and pulling out things that does not involve k outside of the summation.

452
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,960
Notice how the circle part literally is the expected value of the binomial distribution.

453
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:24,680
And the one in the blue circle is sum of each probability which should add to one.

454
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,560
Now we can factor out like terms and make some substitutions.

455
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,600
And this should look awfully familiar.

456
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Once we take the exponent to find the geometric mean, it comes out to exactly same expression

457
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,320
as the median and the mode.

458
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,720
And once again, we can derive the Kelly's formula from here.

459
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,720
I want to wrap it up with the final remark that provides an interpretation of the formula.

460
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,320
Since the geometric mean is supposed to be the multiplicative average, we can take the

461
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,560
nth root to find the average net game per single play.

462
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,880
If we win, we multiply by 1 plus tr to the principal capital, and if we lose, we multiply

463
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
by 1 minus sr.

464
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,760
So we can think of this as the average multiplier per single play.

465
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,640
And if we instead find the geometric mean of the total return for the binomial random

466
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,920
variable of one trial, we get this exact value as well.
