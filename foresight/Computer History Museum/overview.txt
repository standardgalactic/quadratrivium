Checking Computer History Museum/Interview of Ray Kurzweil.txt
1. **Accelerating Returns**: Ray Kurzwein discusses the "law of accelerating returns," which describes the exponential growth of information technology and its predictable trajectory based on historical data. This law has been consistent despite historical events like world wars, economic depressions, etc.

2. **Predictability of Exponential Growth**: The price performance of computing, along with other information-related metrics (like internet traffic or biological research), follows a doubling pattern every 1.5 years, which Kurzwein has observed over the past three decades and predicts will continue.

3. **Evolutionary Processes**: Kurzwein applies an evolutionary framework to both technological and biological processes, suggesting that each stage of evolution adopts new capabilities, which then enable faster evolution in the next stage. This is evident in the rapid development of human civilization compared to the slow pace of biological evolution.

4. **Current Trends**: Kurzwein believes that the current trends of exponential growth in information technology will continue and lead to significant advancements in AI, medical science, and other fields.

5. **Human Longevity and Transcendence**: He predicts that humans will overcome biological limitations, including death, through technological means such as nanotechnology and biological engineering. This transcendence is a natural progression of human evolution as we seek to extend our capabilities.

6. **AI and the Present**: Kurzwein asserts that unlike past predictions about AI that did not come to fruition, the current advances in AI are backed by this exponential growth trend and are more likely to succeed due to the increased computational power available today.

7. **Implications**: While the power of these technologies is predictable, their specific applications—whether they will lead to positive outcomes (promises) or challenges (perils)—is a matter of ongoing debate and interpretation. However, Kurzwein is confident in the overall direction and progress of information technology.
