0	17960	Good afternoon. We're here with Dr. Raymond Kurzweil. It's July 13, 2009, and Dr. Kurzweil,
17960	19480	thanks so much for being with us today.
19480	20480	Yeah, it's my pleasure.
20480	25960	I'd like to start by asking you how you would explain your vision of the future to an intelligent
25960	26960	12-year-old.
26960	31560	In the same way I would explain it to anyone else, in fact, a 12-year-old will probably
31560	37480	get it very quickly. Even a 12-year-old has been around long enough to see the exponential
37480	43960	growth of information technology, the accelerating pace of change. I mean, only a few years ago,
43960	48760	maybe when this 12-year-old started using computers, we really didn't use wikis or blogs
48760	56400	or social networks. We didn't use tweets a few hours ago. That's a small exaggeration.
56400	60520	Right back a decade, maybe it's before the 12-year-old's time, most people didn't use
60520	67040	search engines. That sounds like ancient history. That's less than a decade ago. The pace of
67040	73480	change is getting faster and faster. The first changes, paradigm shifts, stone tools, fire,
73480	78280	the wheel, took tens of thousands of years. The printing press took two centuries. The
78280	82840	telephone only took half a century to reach a quarter of the population, and now we have
82840	88720	major paradigm shifts in just a few years' time. That's the nature of an evolutionary
88720	94560	process. Technology is an evolutionary process. It's survival of the fittest, just like biological
94560	100640	evolution. Biological evolution or technological evolution will evolve a capability and then
100640	106280	adopt that capability and use it to evolve the next stage. That's why the next stage
106280	113520	goes more quickly. It builds on the shoulders of the previous generation and this exponential
113520	120520	growth and the capability of these technologies. If you measure the power of these technologies,
120520	125680	let's say per dollar, the amount of computation you get, the number of MIPS per dollar, or
125680	129960	the number of bits that you can buy per dollar, or the number of bits you move around on the
129960	134480	internet, or the number of bits of brain data we're getting, or the number of base pairs
134520	139360	of DNA that we're sequencing in a year, the cost of sequencing a base pair of DNA, these
139360	146680	fundamental measures of information technology grow in an exponential manner. Now, maybe
146680	153680	a 12-year-old hasn't become familiar with exponential numbers, but if I count 30, if
153680	163680	I take 30 steps linearly, I go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 30 steps later I'm at 30. If I count exponentially,
163680	170680	I double each time, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30 steps later I'm at a billion. It ultimately explodes.
171040	175400	We start out doubling little numbers, but finally we're doubling big numbers and there's a huge
175400	181200	difference between the linear perspective and the exponential perspective. It's the nature
181200	187240	of human intelligence. Basically, if you ask what is intelligence, intelligence makes predictions
187240	193320	about the future, so we are constantly anticipating what will happen next. But our intuition,
193360	199560	what's hardwired in our brains is a linear prediction about the future. When we walked
199560	203480	through the fields a thousand years ago, we saw something coming at us through the corner
203480	207840	of our eye. We made a linear prediction where that animal would be and what to do about it,
207840	213360	and that's hardwired, and that works quite well. But it doesn't work well in anticipating
213360	219360	the nature of information technology. So even sophisticated scientists will use their intuition,
219400	225760	which is linear, to think about where technology will be in 5, 10, 20 years. But the true nature
225760	230800	of it is exponential, and that's why people's imagination fails them when they think about
230800	236440	the future. When I was a student at MIT, we all shared a computer, took up half a building,
236440	240880	it's an IBM 7094, maybe it's here, it costs tens of millions of dollars. The computer in
240880	246520	your cell phone today is a million times cheaper and a thousand times more powerful. That's
246600	252600	a billion fold increase in the amount of computation you get per dollar since I was a student, and
252600	259600	we'll do it again in the next 25 years. So this is a very revolutionary characteristic
259600	265960	of information technology, and it's not just Moore's Law. Moore's Law talks about shrinking
265960	271040	the size of components on an integrated circuit. Moore's Law is just one of these paradigms.
271040	276440	It was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing. We had four paradigm
276920	282240	Moore's Law. The exponential growth of computing goes back decades before Gordon Moore was
282240	287840	even born. I put lots of computers going back to the 1890 American census, the first census
287840	293480	to be automated with electromechanical equipment, on a logarithmic graph, and there's a smooth
293480	300480	progression for 110 years. We've made trillions fold increase in the amount of computation
301480	306400	you can buy per dollar over the last century, and it was not affected by any of the things
306440	311360	that happened. You don't see any evidence of impact of the Great Depression, World War
311360	317360	I or II or the Cold War. There's just this inexorable progression in the power of computers.
317360	322120	At the same time, we've shrunk them to be smaller at a rate of 100 and 3D volume per
322120	327920	decade, and it's true not just of computers, but anything where you can measure the information
327920	333120	content of a technology, and we can talk about some of the other aspects of information technology
333160	340160	like our biology. This exponential growth is quite revolutionary. It's powerful as these
340760	346240	computers are today and other forms of information technology. 25 years from now, there'll be
346240	353080	a billion times more powerful again, and 100,000 times smaller, so you get some idea of what
353080	354960	will be feasible.
354960	360000	How has science fiction influenced your thinking, if at all?
361000	367680	Well, I read the Tom Swift Junior series when I was eight, nine, and ten. That impressed
367680	374680	upon me the idea that you can find ideas and inventions to overcome any problem. That was
374680	381360	kind of the philosophy of my family. So the plot of every one of those novels was the
381360	388360	same. Tom Swift Junior would get into some problem, and the fate of the human race hung
389080	396080	in the balance. He would disappear into his basement, and the sort of tension of each
399120	404480	novel was what idea would he come up with to save the day. And invariably, he'd come
404480	411080	up with some very clever idea that you wouldn't have thought of that overcame the problem.
411080	416480	And it did represent my own philosophy, which I got from my family, that no matter what kind
416480	421960	of problem you encounter, there's a solution out there, and you can find it. And it was
421960	427480	personalized. You, Ray, can find this solution, and you should look for it, and when you find
427480	432480	it, you should implement it. And that's been kind of an imperative in my life.
432480	439480	Great answer. Now, a lot of your life's activities have combined, excuse me, combined humans
440680	446440	and technology. We can start with the EOCR, optical character recognition stuff, the synthesizers,
446440	453400	now the singularity. Is that a life motif in your life that's combining and or enhancing
453400	460400	the human condition? It actually goes back to a feeling I had when I was five. My parents
460400	465160	gave me all these record sets and construction toys, and I had this idea, if you put things
465160	469720	together in just the right way, you could create transcendent effects. I did not have
469720	474080	that vocabulary, but I do remember the feeling as a five-year-old, that, wow, I can put these
474120	481280	things together and do something magical that would overcome human problems. And I decided
481280	487940	I would be an inventor, and I remember having that idea, and I did have that much vocabulary.
487940	491080	And other kids were wondering what they would be, and I always had this conceit, I know
491080	497040	what I'm going to be. And my invention started to get some traction when I was seven or eight.
497040	501560	I created a puppet theater. There was kind of a virtual reality world, and I had a command
501560	506440	station, and I could move the sun and the stars and characters on and off the stage
506440	512360	with these mechanical linkages, and I could control the small universe from my command
512360	518400	station. I discovered the computer when I was twelve, and I had the feeling then that you
518400	523280	could recreate reality in the computer. You could create virtual realities, you could
523280	530280	recreate aspects of our thinking, and that sort of animated me starting when I was twelve,
531000	538000	I had access to some early 1401s and IBM 1620s back starting in 1960, and I also built
538480	543840	some of my own computerized devices. And I had this idea that really the heart of human
543840	549120	intelligence was our ability to recognize patterns, and very much the history now of
549120	555160	neuroscience confirms that. That is what human beings do very well. We're very good at looking
555160	560040	at a chessboard and seeing a pattern. We're not very good at doing the logical mini-max
560040	566240	algorithm in our head. Kasparov was asked, how many moves ahead do you look per second
566240	572080	when Deep Blue could analyze 300 million board positions in this recursive expanding tree
572080	579080	of move, counter move possibilities? Deep Blue could do 300 million. How many do you
579160	585200	do, Mr. Kasparov? And he said less than one. So how is it that he can hold a candle to
585200	589400	a computer? Well, he's got a deep power as a pattern recognition. That is the heart of
589400	593440	human intelligence. By the way, computers are much better now at the pattern recognition
593440	599680	aspect. So even with one percent of the computation of Deep Blue, they can do even better than
599680	606520	Deep Blue did, because we've mastered pattern recognition more than we have in the past.
606520	611280	Pattern recognition is still not as good as humans, but it's getting better and better,
611280	616720	and that is the heart of what human beings do. And I had this sense really starting when
616720	622920	I was 12. When I was 14, I did a project to analyze melodies, to look for the patterns
622920	628080	that a composer would use, and I would feed in Chopin or Mozart, and I had ways of finding
628080	634040	the patterns, and then composing original music using the same patterns. And indeed,
634080	638960	it would sound like a student, maybe a third grade student of Chopin or Mozart, depending
638960	645080	on who I had analyzed. And that was my first pattern recognition project. It won some prizes
645080	648960	like the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. I was one of the finalists that got to meet
648960	656200	President Johnson, and that was my first pattern recognition project. My first major commercial
656200	662640	project in pattern recognition was OmniFont Optical Character Recognition. And that really
662680	667440	dealt with the key issue of finding invariant features and patterns, because that's what
667440	673960	pattern recognition does, particularly at the human level. We're able to look at a face and
673960	680720	we're able to recognize the invariant features. No matter how the face is pointed, even if it's
680720	689360	occluded, even if it's represented through a distorted lens, we can find the invariant features.
689400	693480	We can find the invariant features of speech, no matter who's speaking, even if the accent is
693480	700160	different, and even if it's a different shaped vocal tract and so on. So we're very good at
700160	709080	recognizing patterns, even if there are changes in the information. And so that's what we did
709080	715760	with character recognition. We were able to recognize that a shape, let's say, that we would
715760	721160	recognize as a capital A, had a concave region facing south, and it had a triangular looped
721160	727240	portion in the northern region, and it had a north central to southeast and southwest connection
727240	732160	and a crossbar between them. These are the invariant features of a capital A, no matter what
732160	739000	type style you use. And we were able to successfully do that. That became kind of a solution in
739000	744480	search of a problem. I sat next to a blind guy in a plane, and he was telling me how he had
744480	750600	difficulty accessing ordinary printed material. But otherwise, Linus was not a handicap, he said,
750600	757920	but he did have this one issue. And so we devoted the omnifine character recognition to the reading
757920	763400	problem of the blind. And we had to develop a couple other technologies, Texas speech synthesis
763400	769400	and a CCD telepath scanner. We developed those and created the first printed speech reading
769440	775280	machine for the blind. Later on, I got involved with speech recognition, which is an even
775280	782200	more complex panel recognition problem. Because if you look at a spectrogram, a picture of
782200	785720	speech of two different people saying the same word, it can look completely different,
785720	790480	yet there must be some invariant features there that allows human intelligence to recognize
790480	794840	it as the same word. Even the same person saying the same word at different times will
794880	801240	look very different. So we developed technology that could handle that, and that got involved
801240	806000	with looking for patterns in human language, which is really the heart of human intelligence.
806000	811880	Alan Turing based the Turing test on language recognizing that language and its hierarchical
811880	818080	nature reflects the hierarchical nature of our intelligence. That's what's really unique
818080	824360	about humans is that we have this neocortex that can understand and deal with hierarchies
824360	829200	of patterns to reflect the hierarchies of patterns that exist in the natural world.
829200	836200	That's great. Could you tell us a bit about your synthesizers and how you came across?
839560	845400	That seems like quite a bit of an outlier, and yet you were very successful at that.
845400	851000	Well, the music synthesizer is an output rather than an input technology, but it's also based
851040	855760	on pattern recognition to really examine the question, what makes a piano sound like a
855760	862200	piano? What patterns of sound enable a piano to do that? So we actually had a model of
862200	866920	how a piano produces sound. We combined that with sampling technology, but sampling by
866920	873720	itself was not adequate to solve the problem because you don't have enough memory to accurately
873720	879880	record every possible sound and how they interact with each other in a piano. So we would model
880000	887000	the signal processing and pattern generation capabilities of a piano to be able to recreate
887000	893400	that realistically and also understand what the human auditory perceptual system does
893400	898440	because it can be fooled by certain things, whereas in other ways it's extremely sensitive
898440	904720	to the slightest variations, but some things it's not able to recognize very well. So understanding
904760	910600	what its strength and weaknesses are, we could recreate the piano with enough accuracy in
910600	917600	the ways in which the human auditory perceptual system was accurate. I got into that really
918200	922640	through the Reading Machine project, and Stevie Wonder was our first customer. He heard me
922640	929240	present the Reading Machine in 1976 on the Today Show. He called us up out of the blue.
929280	935800	Our receptionist didn't really think it was him, but he did come over, and we happened
935800	943080	to just finish our first Reading Machine that we could actually part with, and he left with
943080	950080	it after we showed him how to use it. That was 1976, and that started what is now a 33-year
952080	958280	friendship. A few years later, in 1982, he was giving me a tour of his studio, which he
958280	963640	called Wonderland, and he was lamenting the state of the art in musical instruments. On
963640	967520	the one hand, there were these 19th century acoustic instruments, which were still the
967520	973480	instruments of choice in terms of creating very beautiful, rich sounds. From a panel
973480	977880	recognition signal processing point of view, we would say they're very complex sounds.
977880	982640	On the other hand, there were these electronic sounds that a computer could generate. They
982680	989200	were very thin, relatively simple, but you could control them much better. Acoustic instruments,
989200	992960	even if you're a virtuoso, you can't play every instrument, and even if you could play
992960	996720	every instrument, you can't play them at the same time. Most of them, you can only play
996720	1002360	one note at a time. You can't sit down and play an orchestra. With these electronic instruments
1002360	1007640	at that time, in the early 80s, you could play a line of music. The computer would remember
1007640	1012080	it. You could play it back, and then you could play another line over it. You could actually
1012120	1017120	erase notes and replay them, just like you would edit a letter on a word processor. You
1017120	1022400	had much better control methods. You could play a whole orchestra or rock band on your
1022400	1027680	computer, but the sounds that you had to use that were available at that time were very
1027680	1032280	thin. When you selected piano, it sounded like an organ. When you selected violin, it
1032280	1037120	sounded like an organ. You said, wouldn't it be great if we could really command these
1037160	1042680	very rich, beautiful, complex sounds of acoustic instruments with these very powerful control
1042680	1048960	methods of the computer world? I felt that would be feasible using some principles of
1048960	1055720	signal processing and pattern recognition combined with the sampling world. We started
1055720	1062000	Kurzweil Music together. He was part of our company, as a musical advisor, to guide the
1062040	1067600	development. We worked together. Two years later, we introduced the Kurzweil 250, which
1067600	1072600	has been recognized as the first electronic instrument that accurately could recreate
1072600	1079600	the grand piano and other orchestral instruments. Shifting a little bit towards the future
1079760	1086760	and your vision of a couple of things. One is, I think, in the year 2039, we achieved
1087440	1093880	parity with our computers that achieved parity in 2029. Computers become as intelligent for
1093880	1100880	some definition of intelligence as humans. Then later in 2050, I believe, they actually
1101720	1108080	can be merged through nanotechnology or other technologies with humans ourselves and augment
1108080	1115080	us. There's a lot in that question, but could you maybe lay it out for us a bit?
1115680	1121240	The first thing that's important to recognize is that computers are growing exponentially
1121240	1128240	in power. They're doubling in less than a year for the same cost. That's actually a
1128840	1133840	trajectory that's been going on for 110 years. We'll continue it and we'll continue
1133840	1138840	past Moore's Law. Moore's Law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth
1138840	1143520	through computing. It was the fifth paradigm. The exponential growth of computing started
1143520	1148440	decades before Gordon Moore was born. We had electromechanical calculators, really
1148440	1153360	based computers such as Alan Turing's machine, which cracked the German enigma code. We
1153360	1158680	had vacuum tube-based computers in the 1950s. CBS predicted the election of Eisenhower
1158680	1164080	in 1952 with a vacuum tube-based computer. Then there were shrinking vacuum tubes every
1164080	1169240	year making them smaller and smaller to keep this exponential growth going. That finally
1169240	1173480	hit a wall. They got to a point where they couldn't shrink the vacuum tubes anymore and
1173480	1178760	keep the vacuum. That was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes. It was not the end of the
1178760	1185160	exponential growth of computing. We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors, and finally
1185160	1189640	integrated circuits and Moore's Law and the shrinking of component sizes on an integrated
1189640	1195080	circuit. As paradigms go, that's been a great paradigm, but it is not the sum total of this
1195080	1202000	exponential growth of computing. It will come to an end by around 2020. The key feature
1202040	1206560	sizes then will be on the order of 4 nanometers, which is about 20 carbon atoms, and we won't
1206560	1211680	be able to shrink them anymore. But we'll then go to the sixth paradigm, which is three-dimensional
1211680	1217760	molecular computing, self-organizing circuits. I talked about this in my 1999 book, The Age
1217760	1222760	of Spiritual Machines. At that time, it was considered a very controversial notion. It's
1222760	1228040	now a very mainstream notion. If you speak to the scientists at Intel, such as Justin
1228080	1234040	Rottener, their CTO, he will tell you they have these kinds of circuits working in experimental
1234040	1239560	form. They feel the crossover will be in the teen years, well before we run out of steam
1239560	1245040	with flat integrated circuits. That will keep this exponential growth going for a long time.
1245040	1252040	By 2019, $1,000 of computation will be equal to the most conservative estimates of the amount
1252880	1258360	of computation we need to simulate the entire human brain, which I estimated about 10 to
1258360	1265360	the 16th 10 million billion calculations per second. We'll achieve that for $1,000 by 2019,
1268240	1275000	even using conventional silicon without even going to the next paradigm. That's the hardware
1275000	1279200	side of the equation. I think that's pretty non-controversial. The more interesting issue
1279240	1286000	is, will we have the software? We've made a lot of progress in artificial intelligence
1286000	1290160	without looking inside the human brain. In fact, up until recently, we really could not
1290160	1295560	look inside the human brain with enough precision to figure out what was going on. These colorful
1295560	1301400	fMRI images would tell you where things are going on if you're solving a logic puzzle
1301400	1306360	or looking at visual information. There's something going on here or there, but that
1306680	1313600	doesn't give you enough precision to see what's going on. The spatial resolution of
1313600	1318040	brain scanning has been doubling every year. The amount of data we're getting is doubling
1318040	1322600	every year. We can model individual neurons. We're getting more and more information. We're
1322600	1327280	showing that we can turn this information into working models in simulations of brain
1327280	1332240	regions. There's already about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled and simulated
1332600	1337040	regions of the auditory cortex, the visual cortex, the cerebellum where we do our skill
1337040	1344040	formation like catching a fly ball. We have figured out how that works. Even slices now
1344200	1350800	of the cerebral cortex, which is the most important region. We've recently simulated
1350800	1356640	substantial slices of the cerebral cortex where we do our logical thinking, our hierarchical
1356680	1362200	thinking, our invariant feature detection for pattern recognition. That's really the
1362200	1367520	heart of human intelligence. We're beginning to understand how that works. I make the case
1367520	1372200	in my book Singularity is Near that we will have all the models and simulations of the
1372200	1379200	human brain within 20 years. By 2029, we will understand enough about the human brain to
1379200	1384880	recreate its fundamental methods, its algorithms. The computers at that time will be far more
1384880	1390200	powerful than is necessary to simulate the human brain. I've been very consistent about
1390200	1396960	the date 2029 when we will have both the hardware and the software to simulate human intelligence.
1396960	1403960	We already have hundreds of examples of software, AI software, in use in our economic infrastructure
1404160	1409160	that does things that used to require human intelligence. Every time you send an email
1409160	1413960	or connect a cell phone call intelligent algorithm through the information, pick up any product
1414000	1418400	that was designed in part with intelligent computer-assisted design, manufacturing and
1418400	1423640	robotic factories, inventory levels controlled by just-in-time inventory, systems that are
1423640	1429800	intelligent, automatic detection of credit card fraud, lots of financial decisions made
1429800	1435280	by computers. Again, an electrocardiogram that comes back with an intelligent analysis
1435280	1440520	by computers that rivals that of doctors, same for blood cell images, intelligent algorithms
1440560	1446000	flying land airplanes, guide intelligent weapons systems. These systems are doing what
1446000	1451600	used to require human intelligence and very often doing them better than humans consistently,
1451600	1458600	very inexpensively. These were actually research projects not so long ago, 10, 15 years ago.
1458600	1462920	If all the AI in the world stopped tomorrow, our whole civilization would have grown to
1462920	1469720	a halt. That was not the case 15 years ago. These are narrow examples of AI. We call them
1469720	1476520	narrow AI because they're doing some particular task, playing chess or analyzing an electrocardiogram
1476520	1482640	and otherwise they don't have the suppleness and subtlety and flexibility of human intelligence.
1482640	1487400	But the narrowness is gradually getting less narrow as we're learning more about how the
1487400	1492680	best example of human intelligence works, which is the human brain itself. It's not hidden
1492680	1497880	from us. That's another exponential progression. I've been very consistent about the state
1497960	1505800	2029. It goes back through several of my books that by that date we will have machines that
1505800	1512440	operated at the human level in terms of the entire flexibility of human intelligence. One way to
1512440	1519080	measure that is with the Turing test, which I think has held up very well. Turing described this
1519080	1536520	50 years ago, Alan Turing described a test whereby a human judge would interview a computer,
1536520	1543800	an AI, and a human, a human foil over what he called teletype lines, basically instant messaging. So
1543800	1549480	the human judge would not see who he or she is interviewing. And if after a few hours he didn't
1549480	1554920	actually specify the rules very well, but if after some period of time the human judge can't tell
1554920	1560120	who's the machine and who's the human, we say that the machine has passed the Turing test.
1560920	1566760	And no machine has yet passed the Turing test. There are Turing tests run every year.
1567480	1574200	Loebner runs one series of tests. And the machines are getting better every year.
1574920	1580680	According to Loebner, if a computer can fool the human judges 30% of the time,
1581640	1586600	we will say that they have passed the test. And the last test they fooled the judges 25% of the
1586600	1592120	time. Now I actually think that those rules are too easy, but I do feel within 20 years that
1592120	1599560	that's probably conservative. Computers will pass valid forms of the Turing test. And then
1599560	1605080	they will then combine what are now strengths of human intelligence, which is our tremendous
1605080	1611560	ability to recognize patterns with ways in which machines are already superior. I mean, your cell
1611560	1619080	phone can remember millions or billions of things accurately. Machines can find knowledge instantly
1619080	1624520	out of billions of possibilities. They can do logical thinking much better than we can.
1624520	1631400	Few mathematicians or no mathematicians can really hold up to Mathematica in terms of manipulating
1631400	1637240	equations and solving theorems and this kind of thing. Machines are better than we are at logical
1637240	1642440	thinking, remembering things, transferring knowledge. If a machine has a skill, it can transfer that
1642440	1647080	skill and that knowledge and that information and that database at electronic speeds,
1647080	1651960	which is a million times faster than the transmission, electrochemical transmission that
1651960	1657160	goes on in our brains or the transmission from one person to another using language.
1657880	1664200	So these are superiority today of machines. When we combine that with a machine that can actually
1665160	1671400	match human intelligence in terms of our ability to recognize patterns, use language and understand it,
1671400	1676920	that will be a very powerful combination. But it's not going to be a matter of us competing with
1677320	1683960	these machines because this is not some alien invasion of intelligent machines from Mars. It's
1683960	1689880	part of our human machine civilization. We've always built our machines to extend our own reach.
1690520	1695000	I mean, ever since we picked up a stick to reach a higher branch, we've extended our physical
1695000	1701000	reach with our machines, our tools. Now we already extend our mental reach. You know, I can take a
1701000	1705000	device out of my pocket and access all of human knowledge with a few keystrokes. That makes me
1705000	1711480	smarter. That extends my mental reach. Very few people can do their jobs today without these mental
1711480	1716680	extenders represented by our computers and all the knowledge bases they command.
1717400	1721640	And we are going to literally make ourselves smarter. We ultimately will put these machines
1721640	1726840	inside our bodies and brains. They're already very close to us. When I was a student, I had to go
1726840	1731960	across campus to get to the computer. Now it's in my pocket. It will make its way into our bodies
1731960	1737000	and brains. And that started. You can put a computer in your brain today if you happen to be a
1737000	1743160	Parkinson's patient or a deaf person. You can put computers in your brain that will replace
1743160	1751160	the functionality that's been lost by disease or disability. And the latest generation of this
1751160	1755240	FDA-approved Neural Implant for Parkinson's allows you to actually download
1755240	1758280	new software to the computer inside your brain from outside the patient.
1759000	1764680	Now today, that Neural Implant is not blood cell size. It's pea size. It's pretty small.
1765320	1770600	But another exponential trend is we're shrinking technology. It's actually, according to my models,
1770600	1778840	a rate of 100 per decade. So these technologies will be 100,000 times smaller in 25 years.
1778840	1785400	In 25 years from now, they will be the size of a blood cell. So my vision is a few decades from
1785400	1791080	now, we will have millions of these nanobots, nano-engineered blood cell size devices which
1791080	1796120	have computers in them. They'll be going inside our bloodstream to keep us healthy from inside.
1796120	1801240	They'll augment our immune system. They'll destroy disease when it's the level of a cell,
1801240	1805640	rather than the level of an organ and it's life-threatening. They'll go into our brains
1805640	1810920	through our capillaries. We'll have Neural Implants without surgery introduced non-invasively
1810920	1816040	through the bloodstream. They'll interact not just with a few neurons, but with all of our
1816040	1821240	neurons. We can have millions or billions of them. They'll put our brains on the internet.
1821240	1827320	They'll provide a highly realistic full immersion virtual reality, incorporating all the senses
1827880	1833720	from within the nervous system. And most importantly, they will extend our intelligence,
1833720	1840280	which they do today, even if they're just in our pockets and in our hands, we can access
1840360	1845560	all of knowledge easily. That makes us smarter, but a convenient place to put them, particularly
1845560	1850360	when the size of blood cells will be in our brains. We won't lose them that way.
1851080	1855720	They'll have an opportunity to more intimately integrate with our intelligence and they will
1855720	1860920	make us smarter. That is what our technology has always done, and it's getting closer and closer
1861000	1866680	to us and more and more intimate. Is thinking then a form of calculation?
1870360	1876200	In some ways, the brain has a very different architecture from conventional computers. A
1876200	1880920	conventional von Neumann machine is very, very fast, but it does one thing at a time.
1881560	1885560	We've taken some baby steps in parallel processing, and you might have a chip now that has four
1886120	1892280	cores or 16 cores, and so there's 16 things at a time very quickly. The brain is massively
1892280	1897960	parallel, really 100 trillion fold, because the calculations take place in the interneuronal
1897960	1908280	connections in the dendrites and the synaptic clefs between neurons, and we have 100 trillion of them.
1908280	1914920	But they're very slow. They calculate about 200 calculations per second. That's maybe 10 million
1914920	1920840	times slower than computers today, and we can build machines that have this massively parallel
1920840	1926840	architecture, or we can simulate it. We really just need to achieve the computational level.
1927720	1933000	It's an engineering detail as to how parallel we make the computers, because they can simulate
1933720	1938760	what goes on inside the human brain. But if you talk about what goes on in a neuron,
1938760	1946920	it is computable, and particularly when we understand the salient information features,
1946920	1953800	we don't have to simulate all of the life support functions of a neuron because we're really building
1953800	1961000	it through a different infrastructure, a different substrate, and we've already figured out what
1961000	1967880	the salient algorithms are for certain regions of the brain. The auditory cortex does certain types
1967880	1975240	of transformations to auditory information, and we really don't have to simulate exactly how a neuron
1975240	1979960	does that if we understand what the neurons are doing from an information processing point of
1979960	1986280	view. So we've already done that for some parts of the brain, and the most important part of the
1986280	1991960	brain is the neocortex. That's where we do this hierarchical thinking that results in language
1991960	1997640	and results in ability to create tools and to understand the world, which is naturally hierarchical
1998440	2004600	as well. And that's what's unique about human beings is that we can do that. Only mammals have
2004600	2011240	a neocortex, and our neocortex, which is about the size of a table napkin, is the biggest.
2012120	2018600	But it's still limited. Why not have a neocortex that's much bigger than a table napkin? Well,
2018600	2025560	we'll be able to extend those limitations by being able to add computation, and that computation in
2025560	2030120	our brains can then be on the internet and can access the vast amount of computing that will
2030120	2036200	exist in the cloud, which is already formulating. So we will be doing some of our thinking out on the
2036200	2042200	cloud. You know, once we have computation inside our brains, that'll be on the internet, and then
2042200	2047160	just like any computer, it will be extending, multiplying its ability by thinking out on the
2047160	2054840	cloud. That's where our future lies. But yes, what the brain does is it processes information.
2054840	2059400	There's some architectural differences with computers. But it's the nature of software that
2059400	2064520	you can write software that will simulate a different architecture. As long as we have enough
2065640	2071080	brute force, we'll have the ability to simulate what goes on in the human brain provider. We know
2071080	2076680	what goes on there. So we also need the software. We need the algorithmic insights. But we're making
2076680	2082040	exponential gains in that as well. And then we'll need a third component, which is education,
2082680	2087560	because you can take a human brain, which has hardware and software, you know, which is
2088200	2094120	integrated together in the human brain. But it doesn't do much unless you educate it.
2095000	2100840	And that's in fact a complex process. A lot of knowledge goes into the education of human beings.
2100840	2107960	In fact, we've had thousands of years of culture to develop the means of educating the brain and
2108040	2115480	accessing all of the learning that goes on at all of our history and literature. And the human
2115480	2122280	brain can access that. But all of that is out there. It's all on the Internet. These AIs will
2122280	2129400	be able to be educated with all of human knowledge readily accessible. But we'll actually have to
2129400	2134200	design that learning program, just as we do for human intelligence.
2134440	2139880	Should we be hopeful or a little concerned about these developments?
2141320	2141800	Or both?
2146760	2153560	I'm not blasé about the dangers of technology. Technology has been a double-edged sword ever
2153560	2159880	since we had tools. Our very first tools, fire, stone tools, the wheel, were used for
2159880	2165400	both creativity and destructiveness. They've always amplified our ability to be destructive
2165400	2171320	in war and conflict. And certainly we've seen a lot of destructiveness come from our tools. I
2171320	2176840	would argue that we've been helped more than we've been hurt. People forget what life was like. If
2176840	2182600	you read Thomas Hobbes, he's described life a few hundred years ago quite well. It's short.
2183240	2190120	Human life expectancy was 37 in 1800. Brutish, disaster-prone, labor-filled. It took six hours
2190120	2196760	to create the evening meal. There were no social safety nets. Most people lived on the brink of
2196760	2202840	disaster and disease-filled. We had no sanitation, no antibiotics. And life was very, very hard
2202840	2210920	just 200 years ago. Human life expectancy was 48 in 1900. We've come a long way in overcoming
2211000	2216600	human suffering. We still have a lot of suffering to go. But technology is a double-edged sword.
2217240	2223720	We've created enough nuclear weapons to destroy all human life, all mammalian life. So that's
2225480	2233080	certainly a downside to technology. AI, strong AI, AI at the human levels and beyond,
2233080	2239000	will be the most powerful technology that we'll ever create. It will have the power to
2239880	2246760	destroy us if we don't build our own moral and ethical values into it. So there's a lot of
2246760	2256760	discussion in the AI field on how to build what Yatkowski calls friendly AI versus unfriendly AI.
2258520	2263000	Certainly, if you're in a situation where there's some AI and it's much more intelligent than you
2263000	2267320	are and it's bent on your destruction, that's not a good situation to be in. We have to
2267320	2271640	basically avoid getting in that situation in the first place. The only thing that could protect
2271640	2281080	you from that would be an AI that's even smarter, that's on your side. And we really need to integrate
2281080	2289320	with this technology. It's not my view of it that it's a civilization apart that we have to combat.
2290200	2297960	The sort of scenario deployed in many science features and movies of man versus machine I think
2297960	2303320	is unrealistic because we're going to be very integrated with our technology. We can see conflict
2303320	2312120	today between different groups of humans and their machines. And the technology amplifies
2313080	2319480	the destructive capability of both sides. But that could be a frightening scenario as well
2320280	2326920	because we do amplify our destructiveness with our machines. So it's a complex issue. I do take
2326920	2331800	some hope from the fact that I think the decentralized nature of these new technologies,
2331800	2337400	like the internet, is inherently democratizing. I wrote in my first book, The Age of Intelligent
2337400	2343960	Machines, which I wrote in the 80s when the Soviet Union was going strong, that the Soviet Union
2343960	2349240	would be swept away by the then emerging decentralized electronic communication. We
2349240	2354520	didn't have the internet yet, but we had early forms of email over teletype machines and early
2354520	2360600	fax machines. And that kept everybody in the know. And I felt this would sweep away the Soviet Union.
2360600	2366440	These were far more powerful tools than the copiers that they were controlling. And indeed,
2366440	2372840	that's what we saw in this 1991 coup against Gorbachev. The authorities grabbed the central
2372840	2378120	TV and radio station, which they had always done before, but it did not keep people in the dark.
2378120	2384600	And the totalitarian control was swept away. And then we saw a tremendous movement towards
2384600	2390120	democracies during the 1990s with the rise of the World Wide Web. And people forget, but the
2390120	2394200	world was a very different place some decades ago. There were very few democracies. And today,
2395000	2401400	there are relatively few holdouts. You can argue about how perfect various democracies are,
2401400	2406120	but there's much more democratization in the world than there was some decades ago.
2406920	2413400	And we also have a democratization of access to the tools of creativity. It used to be,
2413400	2417080	if you wanted to create a movie, you had to be a big Hollywood studio. If you wanted to do some
2418440	2423400	technology development, you had to be a big corporation, a government lab, or an academic
2423400	2428920	lab. Today, a kid in her dorm room can create a full-length motion picture in high definition
2428920	2434920	with a $500 camera on her PC. A couple of kids at Stanford, as a dorm project, wrote a little bit
2434920	2440440	of software and revolutionized web search and created a company worth $100 billion today.
2440440	2445240	And there's lots of other examples of that. And these tools are literally in everybody's hands.
2445240	2450440	It's not just the haves and the richer, getting richer. I mean, take these so-called cell phones,
2450440	2456520	they're really very powerful devices that access all of human knowledge and are really tools of
2456520	2461400	creativity there in half the hands of the world. I just got back from China, half the farmers in
2461400	2468680	China have them. And nearly everyone will have them within a few years. So the tools of creativity
2469320	2475800	and access to them have been democratized. These are positive indications. But technology,
2475800	2481640	nonetheless, can be creative and overcome suffering on the one hand or destructive on the
2481640	2488200	other. We've had that intertwined promise and peril ever since we've had stone tools and fire.
2488200	2496360	And so it's an old story. And we need to keep these technologies safe. And it's a complex
2496360	2501320	issue as to how to do that. On the one hand, we need ethical standards to prevent accidental
2501320	2507720	problems. So for example, biotechnology, which is the ability to reprogram biology as a set of
2507720	2514120	information processes, that's a whole new concept. And we're using that to reprogram biology away
2514120	2520600	from disease, presumably good things. But it could also be misapplied by a bioterrorist to
2520600	2526360	create a new biological virus that could be more deadly or more communicable or more stealthy.
2526360	2531320	Now to prevent that from happening accidentally, we have ethical standards. They're called the
2531320	2540200	Asilomar Guidelines. And they have actually kept biotechnology safe for 30 years. But if you have
2540200	2545720	a bioterrorist, he's not going to follow those ethical standards. So we also need a rapid response
2545720	2551880	system that would act as a kind of technological immune system. And a good model of that is how
2551880	2557640	we deal with software viruses. We actually have an immune system. We automatically detect new
2557640	2563160	software viruses, which emerge every day. There are destructive people who write these software
2563160	2570840	viruses and put them out and we detect them. And we reverse engineer them. An antiviral program
2570840	2576040	is coded, in some cases, automatically spread virally on the internet. And within hours,
2576680	2581960	we have protection from a new software virus. And you can argue about how perfect it is. But
2581960	2587000	nobody has taken down even a portion of the internet for even a second over the last 10 years.
2587000	2593880	It's been a very robust system because we do have a technological immune system that protects us
2593880	2599880	from software viruses. We need a similar system for biological viruses. And I've actually been
2599880	2605960	working with the Army. I'm on the Army Science Advisor Group. And the primary issue that I've
2605960	2613960	been dealing with is a rapid response system for biological viruses. We do have the technological
2613960	2624280	ideas to do that. Do you think a computer can become self-aware? And if so, when might this
2624600	2633560	happen? Well, part of human intelligence is the ability to reflect on ourselves, reflect on our
2633560	2640120	thinking, have a model in my brain of how my brain creates models of the world so I can think about
2640120	2646840	my thinking. And we can take that level of recursion several more steps and think about ourselves
2646840	2652360	thinking about ourselves thinking. And human beings are capable of doing that because of the
2652360	2659480	hierarchical thinking of the neocortex. Is that being self-reflective? From an objective point
2659480	2664840	of view, it is. You have an entity that's thinking about itself thinking and can create models of
2664840	2671400	itself thinking. But philosophically, that's not really the same thing as consciousness,
2672200	2678840	the sort of feeling that one has. You can talk about how the brain processes the color red,
2679560	2687080	but the feeling of redness, let alone more subtle feelings like happiness and joy and humor.
2689160	2695400	The feeling of that, which is what we associate with consciousness, is very hard to describe.
2696680	2702440	And ultimately, if you talk about what some people refer to as the hard problem of consciousness,
2703240	2709960	it's fundamentally not a scientific issue because a synonym for consciousness is subjective
2709960	2715560	experience. And if you ask, well, what is science, science is objective observation
2716360	2722040	and deductions from that. There's a conceptual gap between subjective experience and objective
2722840	2729240	observation. Another way of saying this is there's really no machine you could imagine building
2729960	2734360	where you slide an entity in and a green light goes on. Okay, this one's conscious.
2734360	2739880	No, this entity is not conscious. That doesn't have some philosophical assumptions built into it.
2739880	2744200	I mean, you could build a machine like that, but different philosophers would build
2744200	2750200	different assumptions into the machine. So John Searle would want it to be squirting biological
2750200	2755160	neurotransmitters. And if it wasn't biological, he would say it's not conscious. And Dan Dennett
2755160	2760840	would want it, wouldn't require it to be biological, but he would require it to be able to think about
2760840	2765640	itself, thinking and build a model of itself. And if it did that, then maybe it's conscious.
2765640	2770040	And different philosophers would have different assumptions. But there's really no way to prove
2770040	2777960	whether another entity is conscious. My prediction is that these future machines will convince us
2777960	2783080	that they're conscious. They will seem like they're conscious. They'll be convincing. We have machines
2783080	2789960	today that talk about being happy or sad, avatars on the web or characters in a computer game.
2790600	2795800	Their behavior is not yet convincing. It's not yet complex enough to really convince us that
2795800	2801400	they're really having these emotions. So they seem like a simulation. In the future, that simulation
2801400	2806760	will be so good that will be indistinguishable from the real thing. And it will actually introduce a
2806760	2812680	philosophical issue. Is there a difference between a totally convincing simulation and the real thing?
2814040	2817640	I believe we will be convinced by these machines. They will
2818680	2827240	succeed in us believing that they are conscious. We will want to believe them because they'll
2827240	2834040	be very influential. They'll be very clever. They'll get mad at us if we don't believe them.
2836200	2840120	And moreover, it's going to get mixed up. It's not going to be a clear distinction. You know,
2840200	2844840	I could be able to walk in a room and say, okay, humans on the left and machines on the right,
2844840	2849480	because it's going to be all mixed up. You can have a biological human that's got computers in
2849480	2855800	their brain, maybe billions of them. There may be more going on in the non-biological portion
2855800	2859560	of their intelligence than the biological portion. So are they machine? Are they human?
2860440	2866040	The action may be with the non-biological part. It's not going to be a clear distinction between
2866040	2872600	human and machine the way it is today, because my prediction is we're going to merge with these
2872600	2879160	technologies. So where does our consciousness lie? Do you have to be biological to be conscious?
2880680	2886680	It's a philosophical question, and it just means that there's still a role for philosophy that
2886680	2891800	science can't answer every question. Now, some scientists will go on and say, well, since it's
2891800	2897880	not scientific, it's not real, and consciousness is just an illusion, and we shouldn't worry about it.
2897880	2902840	It's a distraction. And you can build a completely consistent philosophy that does not have consciousness
2902840	2909400	in it. But my own view is that it's a mistake, because our whole moral system is based on
2909400	2915720	consciousness, and our whole legal system is based on our moral system. So if I hurt someone,
2915720	2923640	cause them pain and suffering, which is a conscious experience, that's a moral and probably a crime.
2924280	2931000	If you extinguish someone's consciousness, that's a high crime. If I destroy some property,
2931000	2935160	that's probably okay if it's my property. If it's your property, it's a crime, not because I've
2935160	2940600	caused suffering to the property, but I've caused suffering to the owner of the property. So it all
2940920	2947640	comes down to consciousness, our whole moral and ethical and legal system. So I don't think we
2947640	2953960	can just dismiss it as an illusion quite so easily. But it's another way of saying there's still a
2953960	2962520	role for the idea of values and philosophical thoughts about the implications of these issues.
2963400	2969640	But we are going to become increasingly non-biological. I don't think it makes sense to
2970600	2977800	insist that these processes have to be running on a biological substrate, because what our brains
2977800	2984920	are doing is shuffling around information. John Swarles says, well computers just shuffle around
2984920	2991640	symbols and human beings really think thoughts and are really feeling these thoughts. But if you
2991640	2997240	look at what in fact is going on, our brains are just shuffling around neurotransmitter levels and
2997240	3003560	ion channels and ions and those are just representing information. And if you can shuffle
3003560	3009560	around the information using a different substrate, the same thing is going on. You could do a thought
3009560	3014120	experiment where you take just a little piece of your brain and replace it with a machine.
3015160	3019800	The machine is operating on a completely different substrate, but it's still the same person.
3020920	3025480	We've actually done this experiment, for example with Parkinson's patients. They had a piece of
3025480	3031000	their brain, it stopped functioning and we replaced it with a computer. And if you ask them,
3031000	3035320	do you think that computer is part of you? Because yes, different people, the same question, you
3035320	3038680	might get different answers. But I've actually asked this question and most of them will say,
3038680	3045000	yes, it's definitely part of me. And well if you carry this thought experiment further and keep
3045000	3051240	replacing more and more portions of the brain with computers, the person's personality never
3051240	3059480	changes. There's a continuity of identity. You would come to the conclusion that it's always the
3059480	3064760	same person, the same consciousness. It certainly would seem that way. At the end of this process,
3064760	3071880	you would have a person that has no biology. So we've discussed these issues actually for
3071880	3077560	thousands of years, going back to the platonic dialogues. These will become actual pressing
3077560	3084680	real issues as we go forward. But the reality is it's not going to be deciding,
3084680	3089720	is that avatar conscious? Because we're going to become the machines. We'll start by becoming
3089720	3095000	partly machine, because we will be putting these machines in our bodies and brains and
3095000	3101000	we'll be partly biological, partly non-biological. But it is the nature of the machine portion of
3101000	3104920	our intelligence that it grows exponentially. That's the nature of what I call the law of
3104920	3112840	accelerating returns. The biological portion is fixed. It's not going anywhere. And I mean,
3112840	3117400	biological evolution is a million times slower than technological evolution. So ultimately,
3118120	3124440	we're going to be much more machine than we are biological. And people, when they think about
3124440	3129080	that, they say, well, I don't want to become machine-like, because they're thinking about
3129080	3134600	the machines that they know today. And if you look at your cell phone or your PC, it's impressive,
3134600	3138200	but you don't want to become that kind of machine, because that is lesser than humans.
3139080	3142840	We probably need some new terminology, because I'm talking about a machine
3142840	3148280	that does have the subtlety and suppleness and intelligence and richness and complexity
3148280	3152520	of human beings. And we will want to become those kinds of machines, because ultimately,
3153240	3157800	those machines are going to be greater than we are. And we're going to want to emerge with them to
3158760	3165800	enhance our own capabilities. And then people say, well, will we still be human if we do that?
3166680	3173320	In my mind, that is what's being, in my mind, that is what being human is all about, going
3173320	3181160	beyond our limitations, extending ourselves. If it wasn't for our tools, our life expectancy
3181160	3185640	would be 23, which is what it was 1,000 years ago. We didn't stay on the ground. We didn't stay in
3185640	3192120	the planet. We have not stayed with the limitations of biology. We're the only species that does that.
3192120	3196760	We make ourselves greater through our tools. And we're going to literally transform
3197480	3204760	our biological substrate. We're going to transcend biology. But in my mind, that's not
3204760	3211800	transcending our humanity, because it is the nature of being human to extend beyond our boundaries.
3211800	3220600	Very nice. What would you be doing if you were born in 1750 at the start of the industrial revolution?
3228600	3234760	Well, I was born in 1750 in a way, because I started with mechanical
3235400	3241160	technology. That's what I had when I was five, six, seven, eight. I had the kinds of tools that
3241160	3248360	people had in 1750. And indeed, in 1750, people built mechanical devices that could calculate
3249160	3258680	using mechanical devices. And they built elaborate automata. And I built devices that could
3258840	3265800	manipulate reality using mechanical devices, at least as much as a five, six, and seven-year-old
3265800	3275320	could do. So I was very much like those inventors in 1750, using mechanical technology. I then
3275320	3283880	discovered information in the computer around the age of 11 or 12. I began to build little
3284600	3291000	computerized devices and also got access to professional computers, like the IBM
3291720	3300360	1401 and 1620. And so I jumped ahead a few hundred years at that time and entered the
3300360	3308280	information age, where we had much more powerful tools to manipulate information. But even in 1750,
3309160	3318040	the idea that you could embody information was around. Leibniz talked about the human brain as
3318760	3323800	a set of logical pulleys. And he described it in mechanical terms, but he described it as a
3325000	3330840	system that manipulated information using the kinds of metaphors that existed at that time.
3331400	3341880	So one of the possible consequences of the vision that you have for the future is a radical
3341880	3349240	extension in the human lifespan. I wonder if you could chat about that and the related thought that
3349240	3356280	we need a finite lifespan in order to sort of, that's how we understand our lives currently,
3356280	3364120	is that we live about 70 years and we plan our lives accordingly. How might that change if we live
3364120	3374920	for, say, 500 years? A health and medicine biology has just made a grand transformation
3375800	3381240	from being not an information technology, just kind of a hit or miss affair where we would just
3381240	3387800	find things accidentally, to where it is now an information technology. We have now the software
3387800	3393800	that life runs on, which is the Genome, and we're also making exponential gains in understanding it.
3393800	3398760	By the way, the collection of the Genome followed exactly my exponential progression,
3399800	3404200	which I call the Law of Accelerating Returns. Halfway through the project, the skeptics said,
3404200	3408120	I told you this wasn't going to work. Here, halfway through the project, and you've only
3408200	3413320	finished one percent of the project. It's pretty pathetic, but actually that was right on schedule,
3413320	3418040	because if you're on an exponential progression where you're doubling your progress every year,
3418040	3422360	once you get to one percent, you're only seven doublings away from 100 percent,
3422360	3426280	and that's exactly what happened. It continued to double every year and seven years later,
3426280	3432520	it was finished, and we've continued that past the end of the Genome project. So 2003, we had this
3432520	3437400	software that runs in our bodies. It's outdated software. How long do you go without updating
3437400	3442360	the software on your cell phone or your computer? Your cell phone updates itself every few days.
3443000	3447640	This software hasn't been updated in thousands of years. Some of these programs are millions of
3447640	3452440	years old. Like the fat insulin receptor gene is millions of years old. It says, hold on to every
3452440	3457240	calorie, because the next hunting season may not work out so well. That was a great idea when
3457240	3463000	our genes evolved. Today, it underlies an epidemic of obesity. We turn that gene off in animal
3463000	3467960	experiments, and these animals ate a lot and remain slim and live 20 percent longer. That's
3467960	3473000	just one of the 23,000 genes we'd like to tinker with. We also have the means now of changing
3473000	3479000	our genes, not just in a baby, but in a mature individual. RNA interference can turn genes off,
3479000	3484520	new forms of gene therapy can add new genes. We'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby
3484520	3490680	boomers. We can design these interventions on computers. We can test them out on biological
3490680	3496840	simulators that are getting more sophisticated every year. Health and medicine has just become
3496840	3503000	an information technology. As such, it's going to double in power every year. That's the nature
3503000	3508840	of information technology in any field. These technologies, even though they're in an early
3508840	3514520	stage today, will be a million times more powerful in 20 years, and it will be a very different
3515240	3521080	era. I've written a series of health books, the last two I've co-authored with Dr. Terry Grossman,
3521640	3527640	and we talk about three bridges to radical life extinction. Bridge one is applying today's knowledge
3527640	3534680	to slow down the aging process, and there's a lot you can do already to slow down aging processes.
3534680	3539720	For example, the cell membrane in every cell is made up of a certain substance called phosphatidyl
3539720	3545480	choline that depletes. Graduates, we get older. That's why the skin sags in an elderly person and
3545480	3551400	their organs don't work as well. That's one of the 12 aging processes. You can actually stop and
3551400	3557080	reverse that by supplementing with that substance. Another aging process is the buildup of plaque
3557080	3565080	in our arteries. It not only causes heart attacks and strokes, but also leads to an elderly person's
3565160	3570920	organs not working very well, claudication of limbs, impotence, and so on. You can reverse that
3571880	3576920	not so easily by just taking one supplement, but you can attack it from any different
3577640	3583480	perspectives and actually slow down. If you're diligent enough, actually reverse
3584120	3590680	that process. Dr. Dean Ornish has shown that. We've described in detail how you can slow down,
3590760	3595400	stop, and in some cases reverse all these different aging processes with today's knowledge.
3596840	3602040	Today, it's somewhat complicated. You have to learn about your own body, what your issues are, and
3602040	3608280	develop a program that's multifaceted to slow down the aging process. In my own case,
3609800	3616760	on biological aging tests, when I was 40, I came out at about 38. I'm now 61, and on these
3616760	3621720	biological aging tests, I come out in my early 40s. I've only aged a few years in the last 20
3621720	3629080	years, according to these biological aging tests of how old I am internally. The goal of this,
3629080	3635800	what we call bridge one, is not to live hundreds of years. It's just to get to bridge two in good
3635800	3643400	shape. Bridge two is only maybe 15 years away when we have really the golden age of biotechnology,
3643400	3649480	this ability to reprogram the information processes that underlie our biology. We'll have
3649480	3657160	very powerful tools to really stop and reverse aging processes with biotechnology methods in 10,
3657160	3663640	15, 20 years. According to my models, 15 years from now, we'll be adding more than a year every
3663640	3669320	year, not just infant life expectancy, but to your remaining life expectancy. So as you go forward
3669320	3674840	a year, your life expectancy will move on away from you. It's not a guarantee, but it will change
3674840	3680840	the metaphor of the sense of time running out. They'll start running in. That's a bridge to the
3680840	3686600	third bridge, which is the nanotechnology revolution. The quintessential app, I used to call it the
3686600	3695240	killer app, but that's not so good a name for a health technology, are nanobots. And we'll have
3695320	3701160	billions of nanobots, blood cell-sized devices augmenting our immune system, going through our
3701160	3707160	body, keeping us healthy, destroying disease when it's at the level of a cell rather than an organ,
3707960	3714440	and that really will keep us going for a very long time. And if you go beyond that, we ultimately
3715400	3721320	will become mostly non-biological by merging with machine intelligence. The nanobus will go inside
3721320	3726280	our brain. They'll interact with our biological neurons. They ultimately will be where the action
3726280	3732040	is. Now being computerized, we will back them up just the way we back up our computers today.
3732760	3738440	Ultimately, most of our brain will be non-biological. Ultimately, it will be so powerful that even the
3739320	3745320	part that's biological will be understood, modeled, and simulated by the non-biological part,
3745320	3751080	and so we can back up the biological part also. And so we'll have a means of restoring our
3751080	3756200	mind file. People a hundred years from now will look back at this era where we went through the
3756200	3761560	day without backing up our mind file. It's pretty remarkable, just as we would think it
3761560	3768120	remarkable today if people didn't back up their personal computer files. We take for granted
3768120	3774280	that you can smash your computer and then recreate its personality, its skills, its knowledge,
3774280	3781640	just by loading it from a backup. So its mind file of your computer is not dependent on the
3781640	3789080	hardware. There's a separation of hardware and software. In our brains, the software is embedded
3789080	3794600	in the hardware. And if the hardware crashes, the software disappears with it. We take that for
3794600	3801800	granted. But ultimately, we will achieve the same thing that we do now in our computers for our
3802440	3808760	brains, which are really information processes. We have information in our brains that represents
3808760	3814200	our memories, our skills, our personality. That's our mind file. It's information. It's the most
3814200	3819800	valuable information we have. We'd like to be able to preserve that. And as we become more
3819800	3827640	non-biological, we'll be able to do that. Now, people sometimes talk about, well, if we have
3827640	3832520	radical life extension, then people live a lot longer. A, we'll run out of resources and we'll
3832520	3837480	run out of things to do and life will get boring. And there won't be new opportunities because the
3837480	3844600	old people won't get out of the way. If we just had radical life extension and no other changes,
3845160	3848920	these would be problems. But it's important to look at all the different things that are
3848920	3853880	happening. The same technologies that will bring radical life extension will also bring
3853960	3859480	radical expansion of our resources. For example, we have plenty of energy. We have 10,000 times
3859480	3864360	more sunlight than we need to meet all of our energy needs. But right now we can't capture it
3864360	3869720	efficiently. I just did a study with Larry Page of Google for the National Academy of Engineering
3870360	3878120	and we described a plan to convert our entire energy system to solar energy within 20 years.
3879080	3883320	That is, in fact, on an exponential. We've been doubling the amount of solar energy we're producing
3883320	3888600	in the world every two years. We've been doing that for 20 years. There's already been 10 doublings
3889240	3892840	and there were only eight doublings away from it meeting 100% of our energy needs.
3893400	3898040	And then you might say, well, but is there really enough sunlight? Well, there's 10,000 times more
3898040	3903240	than we need. We only have to capture one part in 10,000 and we'll be able to do that with nano
3903240	3908680	technology applied to solar panels. There are similar new technologies for water, for food,
3909240	3915240	for housing that can meet the material needs of a growing biological population.
3916120	3919960	And life won't be boring because we're going to be making ourselves smarter. We're going to merge
3919960	3925080	with this technology. We're going to expand our minds quite literally. We're going to expand our
3925080	3930760	experiences. We'll have virtual reality from within the nervous system, incorporating all of
3930760	3936440	the senses. We'll be able to choose a virtual reality environment just as we choose a website
3936440	3945240	today. And unlike, say, Second Life Today, which is small and flat and on your screen and sort of
3945240	3950280	cartoon-like, these will be full immersion virtual reality environments that compete with real reality
3950280	3955560	and ours realistic as real reality. And you can have a different body, different virtual body
3955560	3960600	in these virtual environments for different circumstances. And so life is not going to be
3960600	3968600	boring. And as for opportunities, we're constantly creating new institutions. Larry Page and
3968600	3975480	Sergey Brin didn't wait for some old person to open up a position for them to create a whole new
3975480	3982120	institution and a new opportunity. And we are expanding human knowledge. It doubles about every
3982120	3988840	14 months. So we create constantly new opportunities to contribute. It's really life that gives meaning
3988840	3994280	to life and the things we can do with it and all the creativity that we can deploy. We don't need
3994280	4000440	death to give meaning to life. In fact, in my view, death is a great tragedy. It's a great robber
4000440	4007960	of all the things that gives life meaning. It destroys meaning and knowledge and skill and
4007960	4015160	relationships. And so we will have the means of transcending that limitation. That is what human
4015160	4020920	beings do as we transcend our limitations. And we're going to transcend this particular biological
4020920	4028760	limitation. Thank you. Previous visions of the past did not pan out, especially in the field of AI.
4028760	4031960	What is different this time? Well,
4032200	4040840	there's certainly no shortage of bad
4041880	4047640	futurism. But my own thesis is based on what I call the law of accelerating returns,
4048200	4055320	which is specifically the exponential growth of information technology. And I got into this
4055320	4059160	because of my interest in being an inventor and I realized that timing was important. So I began
4059160	4064200	to study technology trends and I gathered a lot of data. And about 30 years ago, I made a pretty
4065000	4071240	unexpected discovery, which is the trajectory of information technology based on measuring
4071800	4076520	the attributes of it, like the price performance of computing or the price performance of biological
4076520	4083480	technologies, follows amazingly predictable trajectories. In the case of computation,
4083480	4088440	going back to the 1890 census, if you put all the computers on a logarithmic graph,
4088440	4095160	they form a very smooth doubly exponential graph. The price performance of computing was
4095160	4101800	doubling every three years in 1900, every two years in 1950, every one year in the year 2000.
4101800	4107640	It's now down to 11 months. It's a very smooth progression, very predictable and was not affected
4107640	4111880	by any of the little things that happened in the 20th century, like two world wars,
4111880	4116040	the Cold War, the Great Depression. It went through thick and thin and worn piece
4116760	4122040	and continues now through the current economic downturn, completely unperturbed.
4122760	4126840	And it's not just the price performance of computing. It's anything you can measure in
4126840	4132600	terms of information, bits being moved around on the internet or bits of data about the brain.
4133480	4139240	All these different measurements follow these exquisitely predictable trajectories, number
4139240	4145000	of bits you can put on a magnetic disk. That's not Moore's law. Moore's law is actually just one
4145000	4149320	example of this. People talk about Moore's law as being the sum total of exponential growth and
4149320	4155320	they ask, well, how long can Moore's law last? Now Moore's law as paradigms go has been a very
4155320	4161080	important one, but it's just one of the paradigms that has brought this exponential growth. It was
4161080	4165960	the fifth paradigm in computers and we see similar trajectories in things that have nothing to do
4165960	4172440	with integrated circuits. So this turns out to be very predictable. I have a whole theory on
4172520	4178600	evolution, both biological and technological as to why this happens. Basically an evolutionary
4178600	4185960	process evolves a capability, adopts that capability and then uses it to evolve the next stage.
4185960	4190840	So even in biological evolution, it took a billion years for DNA to evolve, but then it
4190840	4196520	biological evolution adopted it. So the next stage, the Cambrian explosion went 100 times faster
4196520	4201320	and biological evolution kept getting faster and faster. Homo sapiens involved in just a few
4201320	4208280	hundred thousand years and the fruits of these evolutionary processes grow in power and I have
4208280	4214440	a whole mathematical treatment of that, but we can see it empirically and I have a team of ten
4214440	4219160	people that gather this data in these different fields and we see very predictable progression
4219160	4225320	of these information technologies. So I believe what we can predict very accurately is the overall
4225320	4231240	power of these technologies. Now when we talk about the implications of it and what this will
4231240	4239720	enable us to do and whether a promise or peril will be more important or predominant, we can have
4239720	4246760	arguments about, but I think the overall power of these technologies is inexorable. Thank you.
