Checking Hasgeek TV/Abhishek Narain - Building 3D Games using Babylon.js.txt
1. **Performance Considerations**: The performance of Babylon.js on devices like Raspberry Pi depends heavily on the assets used and the complexity of the scene. Optimizing asset size (fewer vertices, less detail) is crucial for performance on limited hardware. Babylon.js itself is optimized to work efficiently with WebGL and handles garbage collection well to minimize RAM issues.

2. **Asset Size**: The size of 3D assets directly impacts performance. Larger assets with more triangles will require more processing power and memory. It's important to work with designers to create lighter assets that can run smoothly on lower-end devices.

3. **Comparing with Other Libraries (3Js vs. Babylon.js)**: Direct comparisons between Babylon.js and other web-based 3D libraries like Three.js would be necessary for a detailed analysis. However, Babylon.js is known to integrate well with various enterprise-grade applications and supports WebVR (where supported by the hardware).

4. **Web VR**: For Web VR scenarios, Babylon.js can be used effectively as long as the underlying hardware supports it.

5. **Resources**: Babylon.js has extensive documentation and a playground for learning and experimenting with the engine.

6. **Support and Community**: The creator of Babylon.js is actively involved in the community, providing support and guidance. There's also a vibrant community that contributes to the library and shares resources.

7. **Strengths**: Babylon.js has a strong focus on real-time rendering with optimized performance, AR/VR capabilities (where supported), and integrates well with other enterprise applications.

8. **Weaknesses**: Without direct comparison to other libraries, it's hard to pinpoint specific weaknesses, but generally speaking, the main challenges might include the learning curve for new users and ensuring that assets are optimized for performance on all target devices.

9. **Further Questions**: The speaker offered to take any remaining questions offline via email or Twitter.
