Checking Theo Von/John Vervaeke ｜ This Past Weekend w⧸ Theo Von #462.txt
 John Reevekey and I had a deep and engaging conversation about the power of literature, the value of information in our current age of abundance, and the search for wisdom and knowledge. We discussed how good literature can lead us from information to knowledge and even to wisdom. John emphasized the importance of being able to iterate and share information effectively, which is one reason why people are drawn to thought leaders, evangelists, and Stoic philosophers today.

We both agreed that our conversation was a collaborative effort, where neither of us could have reached the depths we did on our own. It was a dialogue that felt alive, allowing us to explore ideas and learn from each other in a meaningful way. John shared his appreciation for my preparation and how I managed to navigate the conversation comfortably, asking questions that were relevant to both myself and our audience.

John also informed me that university courses in Canada are often open to auditors, provided they have permission from the instructor and it complies with fire codes. This means that anyone interested can sit in on a class for learning purposes, including those who wish to observe his classes.

Overall, our conversation highlighted the value of thoughtful dialogue and the pursuit of wisdom in an era oversaturated with information. It was a delightful exchange, and I'm grateful to John for his insights and for the opportunity to engage in such a meaningful conversation.
