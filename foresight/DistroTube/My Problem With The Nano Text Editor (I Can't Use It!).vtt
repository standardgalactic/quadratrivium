00:00.000 --> 00:02.860
So, what is it that I have against Nano?

00:02.860 --> 00:05.720
What is my problem with the Nano text editor?

00:05.720 --> 00:08.640
People really want me to answer this question.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.200
This is something that has been constantly asked over the years of me doing this YouTube

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
channel.

00:14.200 --> 00:19.160
For one thing, I spend a lot of time covering really extensible text editors like Vim and

00:19.160 --> 00:22.760
Emacs, and I really never talk about Nano.

00:22.760 --> 00:27.120
When I do talk about Nano, I'll be honest, I don't necessarily talk about Nano in a

00:27.120 --> 00:28.120
good light, right?

00:28.120 --> 00:31.160
A lot of people are like, hey, man, what is it?

00:31.160 --> 00:32.840
What is it that you have against Nano?

00:32.840 --> 00:35.080
Why do you hate Nano so much?

00:35.080 --> 00:39.080
Where does all this built-in dislike for Nano come from?

00:39.080 --> 00:43.960
And I'm just going to go ahead and say this, these people that imagine that I hate Nano,

00:43.960 --> 00:44.960
they're not imagining it.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.320
I really do hate Nano as a text editor.

00:47.320 --> 00:51.880
Now, that being said, there's nothing wrong with you using Nano as your text editor.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.400
If you want to use Nano, keep using it.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.480
You use the software.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
You want to use.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.480
I use the software that I want to use.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.760
We all make these personal choices as far as the software we choose to use.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.200
And if Nano is working for you, keep using it.

01:05.200 --> 01:10.200
For me, I'm going to go ahead and tell you, I've got some things against Nano that really

01:10.200 --> 01:11.680
bugged the hell out of me.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.920
Probably my biggest issue with Nano is with any text editor, whether it be Nano, Vim,

01:16.920 --> 01:21.280
Emacs, it really doesn't matter, to get the most out of any text editor, you really need

01:21.280 --> 01:25.000
to learn all the built-in functionality of that editor.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.520
You need to learn all the already assigned key bindings to that editor, right, to get

01:29.520 --> 01:34.120
the most out of it, to learn how to really navigate around a document quickly and make

01:34.120 --> 01:37.840
those edits, you know, much faster to really speed up that process.

01:37.840 --> 01:42.120
You need to learn the key bindings and Nano has a lot of key bindings already assigned

01:42.120 --> 01:43.120
to it.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.880
Many of you Nano users actually don't realize just how many key bindings there are in Nano.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.320
There's an extensive list of key bindings available to you.

01:51.440 --> 01:56.040
Matter of fact, I should actually link to like a Nano cheat sheet of all the key bindings

01:56.040 --> 01:57.640
that are built into it.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.640
There's a lot, right?

01:58.640 --> 02:02.960
So, there's a learning curve to Nano, just like there is with Vim, just like there is

02:02.960 --> 02:06.120
in Emacs, you have a lot of learning to do up front.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.520
You need to learn all those key bindings.

02:07.520 --> 02:12.760
You need to get used to all those key presses, those strokes, right, and here's the thing,

02:12.760 --> 02:17.800
with Nano, that learning curve to learn all that stuff, it's not worth it because Nano

02:17.880 --> 02:22.880
at the end of the day, there's only so powerful, there's only so much you can do with a very

02:22.880 --> 02:28.480
basic plain text editor like Nano, where with Vim and Emacs, yes, there's a huge learning

02:28.480 --> 02:29.480
curve.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.120
You got to learn all these key bindings, you got to learn the plugin system, you may have

02:33.120 --> 02:39.000
to learn how to write in Vim script or Lua or Emacs list if you're using Emacs, you're

02:39.000 --> 02:43.320
going to have to learn some stuff, but it's worth it in the end because of what those editors

02:43.320 --> 02:49.760
ultimately can do, what they can become with you being knowledgeable and how they're scripted

02:49.760 --> 02:54.160
and, you know, with Nano, there's a learning curve to Nano and that learning curve just

02:54.160 --> 02:55.160
isn't worth it.

02:55.160 --> 03:00.680
Also with Nano, just like with Vim and Emacs, there's some basic plugin functionality available,

03:00.680 --> 03:06.080
you know, there's a few Nano plugins, there's a config file, you've got your Nano or C

03:06.080 --> 03:10.160
file, right, that you can play around with, you know, change some settings, but at the

03:10.160 --> 03:14.760
end of the day, there's only so much extending of Nano you can do.

03:14.760 --> 03:19.560
The sky is the limit with Vim and Emacs as far as extensions and what you can turn those

03:19.560 --> 03:25.600
text editors into Emacs can practically become a full IDE, hell, Emacs can practically become

03:25.600 --> 03:30.080
its own desktop environment, you can extend it to that kind of capability, where Nano

03:30.080 --> 03:34.040
at the end of the day is really just a very basic plain text editor.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.120
There's not a lot of plugins out there, there's just a few, you can only do so much with the

03:38.120 --> 03:44.080
config file, even turning on things like basic syntax highlighting and things like that,

03:44.080 --> 03:45.880
you know, it's just not great.

03:45.880 --> 03:50.760
Yeah, it doesn't have the kind of capabilities that both Vim and Emacs, for example, have.

03:50.760 --> 03:57.000
So really, that's my only gripe is when I get into Nano and try to do anything in Nano,

03:57.000 --> 04:02.400
it's got these weird set of key bindings that are not standard, it's a complete different

04:02.400 --> 04:07.420
set of key bindings than you would use in something like Vim or in Emacs or even plain

04:07.420 --> 04:13.220
text editors like G-Editor, Nano has its own weird set of key bindings that you have to

04:13.220 --> 04:14.900
learn, it's just not worth it.

04:14.900 --> 04:19.780
That's really my complaint is it's uncomfortable to use and I don't want to learn it, I don't

04:19.780 --> 04:23.660
want to waste time learning it just because at the end of the day, I just don't think

04:23.660 --> 04:25.460
that that is time well spent.

04:25.460 --> 04:31.860
For me, Nano is not a in-game text editor, that's not ultimately where you want to end

04:31.860 --> 04:36.540
up as far as your text editing software of choice.

04:36.540 --> 04:41.420
I think where you want to end up is something like Vim or Emacs.

04:41.420 --> 04:46.900
What Nano is really good for and what I might would use Nano on occasion for is if I need

04:46.900 --> 04:53.980
to make a quick edit, a really quick, simple edit to a config file on my system or a machine

04:53.980 --> 04:59.140
I remote into, SSH into a machine and maybe Nano is the only editor on that server and

04:59.140 --> 05:04.700
I don't want to install another editor on that server just to make a really quick five

05:04.700 --> 05:08.380
second edit to one config file, I'll just use Nano for that.

05:08.380 --> 05:09.380
Why not?

05:09.380 --> 05:14.420
I can make it work for something really simple, if it's a situation where I don't have to

05:14.420 --> 05:19.060
spend a significant amount of time in an editor, Nano is fine for those tasks.

05:19.060 --> 05:25.420
But where Nano really falls apart is if you're going to do a ton of writing, a ton of programming,

05:25.420 --> 05:30.380
a ton of scripting, creative writing, whatever it happens to be, you're writing your latest

05:30.380 --> 05:31.380
novel.

05:31.380 --> 05:36.040
Nano is definitely not the best tool for a job like that.

05:36.040 --> 05:40.860
That is where tools like Vim and Emacs and those really extensible text editors, that's

05:40.860 --> 05:46.740
where they shine because they have so much more functionality available for you for whatever

05:46.740 --> 05:47.740
task you're doing.

05:47.740 --> 05:53.620
You've got all these thousands of plugins available to help you programmers and developers

05:53.620 --> 05:58.300
or you creative writers or whatever it happens to be that you need that text editor for,

05:58.300 --> 06:02.660
they can make that happen where Nano at the end of the day is just a very basic piece

06:02.660 --> 06:03.660
of software.

06:03.660 --> 06:07.900
And where some of my obvious dislike of Nano comes into play, you guys sometimes see it

06:07.900 --> 06:08.900
on camera.

06:08.900 --> 06:16.980
I spent so many years using Vim and Emacs, I find Nano, it's so damn frustrating when

06:16.980 --> 06:22.860
I end up in Nano in a virtual machine, if I'm checking out a Linux distribution and Nano

06:22.860 --> 06:25.820
is the only editor on it or whatever it happens to be.

06:25.820 --> 06:30.500
If I end up in Nano for some reason, then I have to try to figure out the key bindings

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
for Nano.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.260
And again, Nano's got this weird set of key bindings that nothing else uses.

06:35.260 --> 06:39.940
It's a complete set of key bindings unlike any other program you've ever used.

06:39.940 --> 06:43.060
And that's part of my hatred of Nano.

06:43.060 --> 06:49.420
I have nothing against GNU, Nano, the text editor, again, you guys that want to use it,

06:49.420 --> 06:52.540
you can for me every time I end up in it.

06:52.540 --> 06:56.660
That frustration builds because I'm a fish out of water, at the end of the day, I'm

06:56.660 --> 06:58.540
just not used to it and that's the problem.

06:58.540 --> 07:04.740
A good analogy is when I end up in Nano compared to Vim or Emacs, when I'm in Nano, it's almost

07:04.740 --> 07:09.420
like I'm typing with both of my hands tied behind my back.

07:09.420 --> 07:13.900
That's how clunky and slow and frustrating I find Nano.

07:13.900 --> 07:19.580
So I hope that answers some of your guys' questions as far as what I have against Nano.

07:19.580 --> 07:23.260
Some of you guys are even asking questions like, what do I have against Nano users?

07:23.260 --> 07:24.980
I've got nothing against Nano users.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.260
I don't care what piece of software you choose to use.

07:27.260 --> 07:31.260
Just like you really shouldn't care what piece of software I choose to use.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.860
You need to worry about yourself.

07:32.860 --> 07:36.180
If you're worried about what other people are doing, you've got some issues to work

07:36.180 --> 07:37.180
out.

07:37.180 --> 07:41.420
Any sane and rational person really isn't concerned about what somebody else is doing

07:41.420 --> 07:42.420
with their life.

07:42.420 --> 07:47.580
So I have no problems with Nano users and when I talk about Nano in a negative light,

07:47.580 --> 07:50.180
I'm not talking about people using Nano.

07:50.180 --> 07:54.980
Some people think when I say a piece of software is not right for me, I dislike a piece of

07:54.980 --> 07:59.460
software, whatever it happens to be, that I'm somehow taking a shot at the people that

07:59.460 --> 08:03.740
use that piece of software and like using that piece of software, that's not the case

08:03.740 --> 08:04.740
at all.

08:04.740 --> 08:09.020
I'm just speaking my personal opinion and many of you guys want my opinions on this

08:09.020 --> 08:10.020
stuff.

08:10.020 --> 08:14.220
So I'm happy to give them, like on this video, I'm very straightforward and honest.

08:14.220 --> 08:18.940
I just don't like Nano and it's not, you know, that you shouldn't like Nano.

08:18.940 --> 08:24.420
Nano is just not the right tool for me for 99% of what I do with my text editing.

08:24.420 --> 08:24.940
Peace guys.
