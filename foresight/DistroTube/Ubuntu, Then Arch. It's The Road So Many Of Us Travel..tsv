0	5240	Well this year has been strange as far as weather down here in Louisiana. We've
5240	10440	had some severe weather during the spring, during the summer, during the fall,
10440	14440	and it's getting kind of crazy here in the winter too. I don't know. It's like
14440	19280	the world is coming to an end, right? All this climate change or whatever. It's
19280	24400	for real, I guess. But anyway, today I wanted to talk to you guys about evolving
24400	28720	as a Linux user. Because sometimes people ask me how I ended up on things like
28720	34040	Arch Linux or Vim or Emacs or how did I get into the terminal and things like
34040	37640	that. And now one of the things with Linux, there's typically two types of
37640	42880	users. There's those that they just want to install something quick and easy and
42880	47080	use it as is. They never want to look under the hood and figure out how it
47080	52520	works. And then there's the other group of Linux users that is the tinkers. They
52520	56160	do want to know how everything works. They want to take things apart and put it
56160	61800	back together again. And because, you know, Linux is full of these nerds that
61800	66040	like to tear things down and build it again. And that's why so many of us
66040	70960	gravitate toward, I guess, not user-friendly distributions like Arch
70960	76280	Linux and the hundreds of distros based on Arch Linux or Gen2 and the various
76280	82080	distributions based on Gen2 and things like that Slackware. And, you know, that's
82080	86080	okay if you're not there yet. I think a lot of people, when they first come to
86080	91400	Linux, they install Ubuntu or Linux Mint. And then, you know, they, I guess, feel
91400	96320	intimidated by those that have gotten past the point of needing to use
96320	100240	something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. And it's not, it's really not about
100240	106000	elitism or arrogance or anything like that. Many of us use Arch Linux. It's
106000	112200	because for what we do, using Arch or an Arch based Linux distribution is much,
112240	117720	much easier for us than using something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint or OpenSUSA.
117720	124080	Why is that? Well, when you're new, you're not going to be doing a lot of crazy
124080	128720	things, right? Like compiling your own software, doing extreme customizations of
128720	132720	your desktop or window manager and things like that. Typically, you just want
132720	136640	something that's really easy and quick to install and looks good out of the box.
136640	140040	And then you're not going to touch it, you know, when you're a brand new user. And
140320	145000	that's okay. Once you get more advanced, though, you really want to build your own
145000	149840	system, right? And it becomes very limiting when you use something like Ubuntu or
149840	154320	Mint, you know, as opposed to something like Arch Linux, because let's take Ubuntu,
154320	159120	for example. Ubuntu comes with its own very customized GNOME desktop environment.
159120	164600	And if you want to hack on it a little bit and change things, it's tough. Ubuntu
164600	168920	makes it really tough. Also, their desktop and the suite of applications,
169000	173960	everything is really tightly integrated together. And sometimes you can't separate
173960	179680	those pieces, because like the Ubuntu desktop is really almost like a meta
179680	185240	package, a collection of things. And sometimes it's really hard to separate
185240	189040	some of the stuff you don't want on the system from the stuff you do, because
189400	192720	just the way these user friendly distributions are built, they package
192720	198160	things in such a way. It's really, again, it's designed for the brand new user.
198600	204360	But for those of us that want to do more than just the real basics, Ubuntu
204360	211120	is hard. It's frustrating to use. I mean, it's, I save so much time using
211360	217040	Arch based distributions compared to Ubuntu, because unlike Ubuntu and Mint
217040	223680	and SUSE, you know, Arch Linux has no, they don't have a dog in the fight as
223680	227040	far as what they do with their desktop environments. If you want a desktop
227040	230480	environment or a window manager, you install the one you choose, it's not
230480	235440	going to be themed or customized in any way, unless you do it. And a lot of new
235440	239320	users think, well, that's crazy. I've got to put in all this work once I install
239320	243920	this window manager desktop environment. Yeah. But you know, that's, that's
243920	248080	what some of us signed up for. Plus, you only really have to do it one time. You
248080	252520	set up your window manager the way you want, save the configs. And you always
252520	257000	have your own configs after that. It's always your desktop environment. If
257000	261800	you will, that you always reinstall. There's no reason to, to go to something
261800	266760	like Ubuntu and have to fight Ubuntu trying to take things apart and put it
266760	270240	back together the way you want. And that's one of the real things about
270240	274080	Arch Linux. That's why the Arch philosophy, they talk about Arch Linux
274080	279000	being simple, right? Arch Linux, the Arch philosophy is all about simplicity.
279000	283640	And a lot of people think, well, that's Arch is not simple because it's not
283640	288800	user friendly. Well, simple doesn't mean user friendly. Simple means everything
288960	294240	is simple by design, right? All the pieces have been separated, you know,
294240	298040	until they're smallest components, basically, and you pick and choose the
298040	302640	parts you want, and you build that thing the way you want to make it look. I
302640	306760	think another reason that Arch Linux is great is because it's rolling release,
306760	310800	right? Rolling release has really caught on. When I started in Linux, you know,
310800	315320	12, 13 years ago, as far as desktop use, rolling releases were seen as kind of a
315320	320880	niche. Nobody took them seriously. Nobody thought they were quote stable. You
320880	326000	didn't see people running them on a server ever like that was unheard of. And
326000	330640	really, people are starting to come around to the idea of rolling releases
330760	336200	being the better model as opposed to static release distributions. I think
336360	341160	Arch Linux has really changed the game there. I think there's a reason why
341160	345800	you're seeing Ubuntu. Ubuntu's popularity is starting to seriously decline.
345840	349800	People don't talk about it as much. I don't talk about it that often. Really,
350040	354640	unless Ubuntu has a big release, I don't talk about it much on the YouTube
354640	358560	channel. Why? There's really not much to say about it. That's not, that's not
358560	361800	where all the innovation is happening these days. That's not where the action
361840	367480	is. The action is really these days, Arch, right? Arch dominates the desktop
367480	371600	Linux world, all the Arch based distributions. Manjaro is exploding in
371600	376760	popularity. Arco Linux is exploding in popularity. Mainstream Arch, even though
376760	381960	it's a command line, is exploding in popularity. There is a ton of people
382360	387320	giving Arch Linux a serious try that otherwise wouldn't have, say, five and
387320	391520	definitely 10 years ago. Some of the other benefits of Arch Linux, you know,
391520	398640	why it has gained ground over things like Ubuntu and Debian and Mint is their
398640	403760	pragmatic stance as far as the repository of software. You know, Arch Linux
404000	409800	does not mind putting proprietary software in its repositories. They, they
409800	416800	are not free software only purists. Now, I'm a free software zealot, but even I
416800	420560	as a free software zealot don't mind them having proprietary software
420560	425400	available for their users in their repositories. What I hate is Linux
425400	429120	distributions that install proprietary software out of the box on those
429240	432880	distributions, you know, and basically they're trying to force proprietary
432880	436640	software on their users. I don't like that, but I don't mind proprietary
436640	441080	software being in the repos available for those that need it and want to use it
441080	445280	because not everybody cares about the free software movement. I get that. So I
445280	451120	actually like the pragmatic stance that Arch Linux takes in that regard. And again,
451120	456000	I think that helps with Arch Linux becoming so popular is the fact that
456200	461720	there's so much software available on Arch Linux that is tougher to get even
461720	466160	on things like Ubuntu. There's, there's stuff that I install that, you know, I
466160	469560	have no problems installing on Arch Linux because I know I can find it in the
469560	475200	Arch repositories or in the AUR, the Arch user repository, or with Arch Linux, you
475200	480560	also have flatpacks, snaps, app images available if you want to use them. And
480560	484840	that's the other thing. They're not forced on you either. With Ubuntu, snap is
484840	488780	pre-installed, you're expected to use snaps. With Linux Mint, they have flatpack
488780	493020	installed and you're expected to use flatpacks. Well, with Arch Linux, nothing
493020	496920	is installed. If you want to use snaps, install it and set it up, you're free to
496920	501080	do so. Same thing with flatpack. If you want to use flatpack, install it, use it,
501120	505040	you're free to do so, but they don't care if you use it. They don't care if you
505200	510720	don't use it. And I think that's the better model. I think, again, I think we're
510720	516600	starting to see this real shift in desktop Linux where really what used to
516600	522760	be in a Ubuntu-dominated game is really now dominated by Arch Linux. And I love
522760	527480	it. I love it because Arch Linux, of course, is a community distribution too.
527480	532760	It's not corporate backed. There's no company really calling the shots. It's
532760	538120	all about us, the community building something great. And I think it's a
538120	544080	model that works. Anyway, that's enough of me rambling and walking around here
544080	547560	in the snow. I don't even know what in the hell I was gonna talk about when I
547560	551880	turned on the camera. I just started walking around and talking. I hope some
551880	557320	of this incoherent mess that I said makes sense at least when I put it on
557320	561840	YouTube. If it doesn't, I do apologize, but you got to understand it's about 20
561840	568200	degrees right now, and I am freezing my balls off. Alright guys, peace.
