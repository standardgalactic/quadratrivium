00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
One of the most common video formats on YouTube is where a content creator recommends you

00:09.000 --> 00:15.360
other YouTubers to follow other related YouTubers to follow other than his channel.

00:15.360 --> 00:20.640
And this is very common in the Linux space as well where Linux YouTubers will create

00:20.640 --> 00:27.040
a video giving you their top 5, top 10, top 20, whatever, other Linux YouTubers that you

00:27.040 --> 00:30.520
should go and check out and subscribe to and watch their videos.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.720
And I've done these types of videos too in the past, I haven't made one recently, but

00:33.720 --> 00:41.200
one thing that's kind of common with these types of videos is that people typically recommend

00:41.200 --> 00:42.440
the same channels.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.880
It's typically the big channels, the really big channels sometimes, channels that if

00:46.880 --> 00:51.120
you're a Linux enthusiast, you probably already know about, right?

00:51.120 --> 00:57.480
I don't need to tell you guys about channels like Brian Lunduk or Luke Smith or Jupiter

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
Broadcasting.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.520
You know, I don't need to tell you about Level 1 Tech.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.440
You guys probably know about those big channels, Quidd's Up and Joe Collins and everything

01:06.440 --> 01:07.520
like that.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.440
I don't need to send you to those channels.

01:10.440 --> 01:16.280
If you have been following a little bit of Linux on YouTube, no doubt you've come across

01:16.280 --> 01:18.080
videos of those guys.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.480
So today I wanted to give, really I wanted to shine a spotlight on some of the smaller

01:23.480 --> 01:28.600
channels, some of the channels that I don't think get enough views and subscribers.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.480
I think they put out great content and for whatever reason, maybe it's because their

01:32.480 --> 01:38.840
channel is a little newer or it's because they focus on a really small niche topic for

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
the most part.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.760
I think these channels, I'm going to discuss 12 channels today that I think are greatly

01:44.760 --> 01:49.120
deserving of far more views and subscribers than they currently get.

01:49.120 --> 01:58.520
That's our topic for the day.

01:58.520 --> 02:06.240
Alright so first things first, if you guys go to my YouTube channel homepage and if you

02:06.240 --> 02:14.080
click on the Channels tab in my page, it will show you every single YouTuber that I'm subscribed

02:14.080 --> 02:15.080
to.

02:15.080 --> 02:21.760
I'm subscribed to probably a hundred different Linux and tech related YouTubers and of course

02:21.760 --> 02:26.160
a lot of these are a lot of the big channels you probably know about and of course some

02:26.160 --> 02:29.960
of these are the smaller channels that I'm going to be discussing today.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.920
Again, many of these you probably already heard of, many of them you haven't though.

02:34.920 --> 02:41.400
So check out the Channels tab here at the DistroTube YouTube page and you'll see everybody

02:41.400 --> 02:44.080
that I'm subscribed to, good channels.

02:44.080 --> 02:49.640
Today though I want to focus on some of the smaller channels that I don't think get enough

02:49.640 --> 02:54.520
attention and part of the reason some of these guys don't get enough attention is the channels

02:54.520 --> 02:59.920
are new and this is one example, old tech bloke, OTB.

02:59.920 --> 03:06.600
His channel just started a month ago, maybe two months ago, he messaged me actually on

03:06.600 --> 03:12.640
Mastodon, he watches some of my videos and he's following me on Mastodon.

03:12.640 --> 03:17.480
I've conferred with old tech bloke a few times and I've watched many of his videos

03:17.480 --> 03:22.200
he's put out in just under two months and this guy is great.

03:22.200 --> 03:28.600
He's very knowledgeable, he has good equipment, good audio equipment, good video equipment,

03:28.600 --> 03:32.840
especially for a beginner YouTuber.

03:32.840 --> 03:39.240
Certainly he's got far more, far better equipment than I started with when I started my channel

03:39.240 --> 03:45.560
and his videos are great, his content's great, solid audio, he's got a good radio kind of

03:45.560 --> 03:48.680
voice and I can't recommend this guy enough.

03:48.680 --> 03:53.280
He's only got 46 subscribers because again his channel is brand new but I can highly

03:53.280 --> 03:58.520
recommend you guys check out old tech bloke, give him a subscribe, watch some of his videos

03:58.520 --> 04:01.360
again, knowledgeable guy and a wide range of topics.

04:01.360 --> 04:07.240
I mean he's got stuff on here about MX and Debian and Slackware and what's the best video

04:07.240 --> 04:12.320
editor on Linux and he does good comparison by the way, I watched that video where he

04:12.320 --> 04:16.640
compared Kaden Live, OpenShot and Shotcut, good content.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.720
So old tech bloke is the first channel I want to recommend to you guys, keep it techy, keep

04:21.720 --> 04:23.220
it techy.

04:23.220 --> 04:31.500
He has 603 subscribers, he's kind of slowed down on his video content creation here lately,

04:31.500 --> 04:37.140
I'm assuming it's probably work and life related, he's only posted one video really

04:37.140 --> 04:41.760
in the last couple of months but hopefully he'll get back on track but keep it techy

04:41.760 --> 04:42.760
is great.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.760
If I go to the about tab I can read a little bit of what keep it techy is about, keep it

04:46.760 --> 04:51.440
techy is a technology channel started by Josh and he helps raise awareness about the Linux

04:51.440 --> 04:56.000
operating system, blah blah blah, I won't read the blurb but basically I can tell you

04:56.000 --> 05:02.040
his videos typically are a little more advanced, I won't say too advanced but he does some

05:02.040 --> 05:07.720
server related stuff, of course some desktop related stuff, again he does stuff about audio,

05:07.720 --> 05:12.440
video and Linux, most YouTubers, most Linux YouTubers are going to cover audio and video

05:12.440 --> 05:15.520
on Linux because that's a big part of what we do.

05:15.520 --> 05:20.520
But again a good mix, good mix of content from this guy because I mean he does everything

05:20.520 --> 05:26.880
from really simple basic like installations and simple terminal commands that you should

05:26.880 --> 05:33.560
know all the way into some more advanced server related topics and once again much like old

05:33.560 --> 05:39.520
tech bloke keep it techy, he's got good equipment, he's got a good microphone, his audio is good

05:39.520 --> 05:46.800
and once again he's got a good speaking voice, a good radio voice and that's so important

05:46.800 --> 05:51.960
on YouTube or on radio but especially what we're talking about today YouTube if you

05:51.960 --> 05:57.000
don't have a good speaking voice combined with pretty decent audio equipment nobody's

05:57.000 --> 06:01.960
really going to listen to you and keep it techy definitely deserves more eyeballs on

06:01.960 --> 06:03.480
his stuff.

06:03.480 --> 06:08.440
And the next YouTuber I want to recommend, Linux related, Red Robo's Workshop, Rob does

06:08.440 --> 06:16.320
some good stuff here, he's again got a perfect radio kind of voice, topics, he focuses pretty

06:16.320 --> 06:22.040
heavily at least here lately on OpenSusa as far as his video content, he does a lot of

06:22.040 --> 06:27.440
stuff about KDE, occasionally he does some off topic stuff, he showed his aquarium with

06:27.440 --> 06:33.160
some shrimp in a recent video but Rob's great, Rob's a good community member too, he comments

06:33.160 --> 06:38.800
on a lot of other Linux related YouTube channels, you guys probably seen Red Robo's Workshop

06:38.800 --> 06:43.640
you know posting and my live streams and many other folks live streams when I do a live

06:43.640 --> 06:45.800
stream or whoever.

06:45.800 --> 06:54.320
But Rob is a great guy, great content and deserves far more subscribers than just 361.

06:54.320 --> 07:00.480
Nicholas Bernstein, now Nicholas here is kind of a newer channel again, he's already got

07:00.480 --> 07:10.760
though 549 subscribers once again, good, good voice, good audio, good video and very knowledgeable,

07:10.760 --> 07:13.400
he's a really good teacher.

07:13.400 --> 07:20.840
Like he explains things very well, he focuses on sysadmin, IT kind of stuff, he focuses on

07:20.840 --> 07:27.080
preparing people for that field and again his explanations are great, you know he doesn't

07:27.080 --> 07:31.480
rush through explanations, kind of like I try to do often times on my tutorial videos,

07:31.480 --> 07:36.160
I kind of take my time talking through stuff, I don't just blow through it talking as fast

07:36.160 --> 07:42.760
as I can, because that is kind of antithetical to trying to cheat somebody that has no idea

07:42.760 --> 07:48.000
about what you're talking to and I think Nicholas is a fantastic teacher, deserves far more

07:48.000 --> 07:54.640
subscribers than the 549 he currently has as of recording this video.

07:54.640 --> 08:02.640
Dark One, Dark One Matt is just a fantastic entertaining guy and the great thing about

08:02.720 --> 08:09.720
Dark One here is he focuses on a wide range of topics which I think is a real benefit,

08:11.400 --> 08:15.320
because I think some of these channels that we're talking about today, they stay small

08:15.320 --> 08:22.720
because they focus on a very tight niche as far as a topic where Dark One covers Linux

08:22.720 --> 08:28.680
related stuff, Linux news, Linux Rants, he covers other tech related stuff not related

08:28.680 --> 08:35.680
to Linux, I mean he covers things like Microsoft Surface Tablets and things like that, he talks

08:36.760 --> 08:42.680
even about Mac I think occasionally, of course Windows and of course he does some gaming

08:42.680 --> 08:49.040
stuff, he's a big gamer, covers Windows gaming and Linux gaming and what I really like about

08:49.040 --> 08:56.040
Matt is he's entertaining his hill, he does a lot of reaction videos where he basically

08:56.680 --> 09:01.800
trashes somebody for being dumb, especially people that make really dumb videos about

09:01.800 --> 09:08.800
Linux which I love, so I really love his reaction videos, he does also music video reactions

09:08.800 --> 09:15.800
which are pretty cool and again he's got 821 subscribers as I'm recording this and I think

09:16.840 --> 09:21.400
he deserves far more attention than he's currently getting.

09:21.400 --> 09:28.400
Colin over at PCTLC, now you guys I know many of you guys like when I do my distro review

09:29.560 --> 09:34.400
type videos and I don't do that many of those type videos anymore because I don't find

09:34.400 --> 09:39.760
them that interesting, they don't interest me as far as that's not the content I really

09:39.760 --> 09:44.480
just want to create, but a lot of people out there do want to create that and Colin over

09:44.480 --> 09:51.480
at PCTLC does a great job with those installation videos and review videos, reviewing various

09:52.920 --> 09:57.880
distros, some of the recent ones are Debbie and Tanny's covered probably for the Big Daddy

09:57.880 --> 10:02.880
Linux challenge and they covered Arch, Open Mandreva, most of these are probably following

10:02.880 --> 10:07.480
the schedule of Big Daddy Linux which we may talk about here in a minute, but Colin over

10:07.480 --> 10:14.480
at PCTLC, great guy, just awesome Linux community member and puts out some fantastic content

10:15.680 --> 10:22.280
again, like, subscribe, share, do whatever you can to help out Colin there.

10:22.280 --> 10:28.080
Sudo Reboot, now Sudo Reboot does nothing but live streams as far as I know of and he

10:28.080 --> 10:34.400
does live streams like almost every day and he typically does long live streams typically

10:34.600 --> 10:41.600
an hour, two hours, three hours or more sometimes and he's not your typical, oh I'm just going

10:41.600 --> 10:47.440
to do a live stream and I have absolutely nothing to talk about, no he's great, he

10:47.440 --> 10:53.000
interacts with the YouTube chat and the community but he also has real content on his live streams

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
like he does Linux-y stuff during his live streams, you know, reviewing distros and

10:59.000 --> 11:04.880
various software programs and things, talks about the news and Sudo Reboot is one of these

11:04.880 --> 11:11.880
guys, he's been around for a long time too as far as on YouTube and I don't know why

11:12.120 --> 11:19.120
he only has 541 subscribers, I think that's criminal, criminally underrated actually,

11:19.720 --> 11:26.720
you guys please go subscribe to Sudo Reboot, he is absolutely fantastic, great guy as well.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.240
Now this is a bit of a bigger channel but I include it in the list because I still think

11:32.240 --> 11:38.360
it's vastly underrated, Destination Linux, the Destination Linux podcast with Zib, Michael,

11:38.360 --> 11:45.120
Dasgeek and Noah is fantastic, so they put out a weekly podcast and you know typically

11:45.120 --> 11:50.160
about two hours long, they record it live, typically you can watch the live recording

11:50.160 --> 11:54.960
and then they go back and edit it and post it a couple of days after the live recording

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
as far as the edited podcast version of Destination Linux, but I think it's maybe the premiere

12:03.680 --> 12:08.840
Linux podcast out there and you know they got a pretty good subscriber base, you know

12:08.840 --> 12:14.560
over 4,000 subscribers but I do think that that's very underrated and I think there's

12:14.560 --> 12:19.240
probably a lot of you guys that are watching this video here that probably have not heard

12:19.240 --> 12:24.840
of Destination Linux and if you have not heard of Destination Linux, please check it out,

12:25.720 --> 12:32.000
Big Daddy Linux, we were talking about that a minute ago with PCTLC, how his distro reviews

12:32.000 --> 12:38.800
cover usually the weekly distro review from Big Daddy Linux live, Big Daddy Linux live

12:38.800 --> 12:45.800
is a weekly live show, every Saturday night you get a couple of dozen people joining live

12:45.800 --> 12:50.640
on a video conference, anybody's free to join, anybody from the community can join them live

12:50.680 --> 12:56.080
on camera, plus you've got a couple of hundred people joining them live in the YouTube chat

12:56.080 --> 13:02.680
every Saturday night and it is great, it is one of the great community things going on

13:02.680 --> 13:09.680
as far as Linux YouTube community, Rocco Big Daddy Linux is really one of the leaders

13:10.200 --> 13:17.200
as far as the Linux YouTube community, he really brings people together in a way nobody

13:18.200 --> 13:25.200
else is doing and I really want to commend Rocco, I think he is just, I can't say enough

13:25.280 --> 13:30.800
about how important Rocco Big Daddy Linux is to the Linux YouTube community so definitely

13:30.800 --> 13:35.560
subscribe, check out Big Daddy Linux live every Saturday night and here lately Rocco has been

13:35.560 --> 13:42.040
doing these Linux spotlights where he interviews people from the community, Linux YouTubers,

13:42.040 --> 13:46.800
Linux developers, just Linux personalities, he's been doing that and those shows are

13:46.840 --> 13:53.440
great as well, check out Big Daddy Linux, again another bigger channel but I think is

13:53.440 --> 14:00.440
just woefully underrated is HexDSL, HexDSL has over 5,000 subscribers, definitely the

14:01.400 --> 14:06.480
biggest channel I'm covering today but I think this guy should have 10 times the subscriber

14:06.480 --> 14:13.000
base, great guy, Hex is just fantastic, he's entertaining, fun to watch, does pre-recorded

14:13.040 --> 14:19.440
stuff, does live streaming, good content, good mix of content, focuses heavily on Linux

14:19.440 --> 14:26.440
gaming which is why the subscriber base is not that high so Linux itself is a really

14:26.880 --> 14:32.320
niche topic, if you have a channel that focuses primarily on Linux you're not going to get

14:32.320 --> 14:36.920
that many subscribers, there's just not enough of us Linux users out there, if you focus

14:36.920 --> 14:43.640
on Linux gaming as a topic, wow that's a niche inside a niche and I think that's part

14:43.640 --> 14:49.000
of the problem but don't let the topic of the channel fool you, I mean he is focusing

14:49.000 --> 14:54.840
heavily on Linux gaming but he does a mix of content, he looks at various terminal applications

14:54.840 --> 14:59.400
recently he did a video about Ranger, I know he's covered various tiling window managers

14:59.400 --> 15:05.000
on his show, sometimes he does tutorials, he shows you how to do things like in the

15:05.000 --> 15:10.240
shell and things like that, so there is some tutorial stuff, some nerdy stuff other than

15:10.240 --> 15:16.840
just the gaming stuff and I find his content some of the best out there, I try to catch

15:16.840 --> 15:22.040
as much of Hex DSL's videos as I can, I can't watch everybody, I don't have time to watch

15:22.040 --> 15:27.080
every video from everybody I'm subscribed to but when Hex puts out something I typically

15:27.080 --> 15:33.640
watch it and I think you guys really if you're not subscribed check him out, well that was

15:33.640 --> 15:38.760
the last Linux related channel but I wanted to cover two channels that really aren't

15:38.760 --> 15:44.600
Linux centric but they're pretty close to Linux that I wanted to cover them, first of all Robo

15:44.600 --> 15:51.880
Nuggy, everything free BSD, yes this is a BSD channel and that is why he doesn't have that

15:51.880 --> 15:57.000
many views and subscribers is because think about how niche Linux is, now think about how

15:57.000 --> 16:05.240
niche BSD is, like we probably have a hundred times more Linux users than BSD users and so

16:05.240 --> 16:12.360
just he's fighting an uphill battle as far as getting views and subscribers but if you are

16:12.360 --> 16:19.800
interested in BSD at all please subscribe to Robo Nuggy, even if you're not that interested in BSD

16:19.800 --> 16:25.880
I mean some of what he talks about is applicable to those of us that run Linux on the desktop and

16:25.880 --> 16:33.960
especially Linux as a server so please check out Robo Nuggy and Greg Hurrell, now a bigger

16:33.960 --> 16:40.680
channel he's got over 4,000 subscribers this is not strictly Linux content though, his content is

16:40.680 --> 16:46.760
Vim, he covers the Vim text editor, many of you guys are probably interested in Vim, I know I

16:46.760 --> 16:52.360
cover Vim a lot on my channel you guys ask me about Vim a lot, you're looking for good content

16:52.360 --> 17:01.320
centered around Vim, you know if you're a potential programmer developer and you're looking to harness

17:01.320 --> 17:09.000
the power of Vim please subscribe to Greg Hurrell, a little bit off the beaten path with the Vim

17:09.000 --> 17:14.600
centric channel Greg Hurrell and the free BSD centric channel with Robo Nuggy but I think all

17:14.600 --> 17:20.440
those guys deserve a ton of views but obviously some of the bigger channels that I didn't cover

17:20.440 --> 17:25.240
because they get covered a lot I mean you guys can check out everybody I'm subscribed to there's

17:25.240 --> 17:29.960
always a chance you haven't heard of some of the bigger channels I'm subscribed to I would tell

17:29.960 --> 17:36.120
you I'm often shocked like when I do if I do a colab with somebody even a bigger channel and you

17:36.120 --> 17:41.240
think so much of our content you know I did a colab one time with Luke Smith and you would think

17:41.240 --> 17:47.480
most people that watch my stuff have heard of Luke Smith but no I had people it's like who is Luke

17:47.480 --> 17:52.520
Smith when I announced that I was gonna do that colab with Luke I'm sure Luke had a ton of people

17:52.520 --> 17:58.040
that watch his stuff that had never heard of me so just because they're bigger channels I know some

17:58.040 --> 18:03.160
of you guys probably have never heard of you know Chris Titus Tech and tutorial links and some of

18:03.160 --> 18:10.040
these really big channels just go to my youtube page click the channels tab and anybody that you

18:10.040 --> 18:15.800
haven't heard of that I'm subscribed to please check them out all great channels and I think

18:16.520 --> 18:23.160
because of the community aspect we really want all these people to grow as content creators

18:23.160 --> 18:28.120
because at the end of the day what we really want is more awareness we want to spread more

18:28.120 --> 18:35.400

18:35.400 --> 18:40.440
