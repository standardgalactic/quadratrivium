0	9000	One of the most common video formats on YouTube is where a content creator recommends you
9000	15360	other YouTubers to follow other related YouTubers to follow other than his channel.
15360	20640	And this is very common in the Linux space as well where Linux YouTubers will create
20640	27040	a video giving you their top 5, top 10, top 20, whatever, other Linux YouTubers that you
27040	30520	should go and check out and subscribe to and watch their videos.
30520	33720	And I've done these types of videos too in the past, I haven't made one recently, but
33720	41200	one thing that's kind of common with these types of videos is that people typically recommend
41200	42440	the same channels.
42440	46880	It's typically the big channels, the really big channels sometimes, channels that if
46880	51120	you're a Linux enthusiast, you probably already know about, right?
51120	57480	I don't need to tell you guys about channels like Brian Lunduk or Luke Smith or Jupiter
57480	58480	Broadcasting.
58480	61520	You know, I don't need to tell you about Level 1 Tech.
61520	66440	You guys probably know about those big channels, Quidd's Up and Joe Collins and everything
66440	67520	like that.
67520	70440	I don't need to send you to those channels.
70440	76280	If you have been following a little bit of Linux on YouTube, no doubt you've come across
76280	78080	videos of those guys.
78080	83480	So today I wanted to give, really I wanted to shine a spotlight on some of the smaller
83480	88600	channels, some of the channels that I don't think get enough views and subscribers.
88600	92480	I think they put out great content and for whatever reason, maybe it's because their
92480	98840	channel is a little newer or it's because they focus on a really small niche topic for
98840	99840	the most part.
99840	104760	I think these channels, I'm going to discuss 12 channels today that I think are greatly
104760	109120	deserving of far more views and subscribers than they currently get.
109120	118520	That's our topic for the day.
118520	126240	Alright so first things first, if you guys go to my YouTube channel homepage and if you
126240	134080	click on the Channels tab in my page, it will show you every single YouTuber that I'm subscribed
134080	135080	to.
135080	141760	I'm subscribed to probably a hundred different Linux and tech related YouTubers and of course
141760	146160	a lot of these are a lot of the big channels you probably know about and of course some
146160	149960	of these are the smaller channels that I'm going to be discussing today.
149960	154920	Again, many of these you probably already heard of, many of them you haven't though.
154920	161400	So check out the Channels tab here at the DistroTube YouTube page and you'll see everybody
161400	164080	that I'm subscribed to, good channels.
164080	169640	Today though I want to focus on some of the smaller channels that I don't think get enough
169640	174520	attention and part of the reason some of these guys don't get enough attention is the channels
174520	179920	are new and this is one example, old tech bloke, OTB.
179920	186600	His channel just started a month ago, maybe two months ago, he messaged me actually on
186600	192640	Mastodon, he watches some of my videos and he's following me on Mastodon.
192640	197480	I've conferred with old tech bloke a few times and I've watched many of his videos
197480	202200	he's put out in just under two months and this guy is great.
202200	208600	He's very knowledgeable, he has good equipment, good audio equipment, good video equipment,
208600	212840	especially for a beginner YouTuber.
212840	219240	Certainly he's got far more, far better equipment than I started with when I started my channel
219240	225560	and his videos are great, his content's great, solid audio, he's got a good radio kind of
225560	228680	voice and I can't recommend this guy enough.
228680	233280	He's only got 46 subscribers because again his channel is brand new but I can highly
233280	238520	recommend you guys check out old tech bloke, give him a subscribe, watch some of his videos
238520	241360	again, knowledgeable guy and a wide range of topics.
241360	247240	I mean he's got stuff on here about MX and Debian and Slackware and what's the best video
247240	252320	editor on Linux and he does good comparison by the way, I watched that video where he
252320	256640	compared Kaden Live, OpenShot and Shotcut, good content.
256640	261720	So old tech bloke is the first channel I want to recommend to you guys, keep it techy, keep
261720	263220	it techy.
263220	271500	He has 603 subscribers, he's kind of slowed down on his video content creation here lately,
271500	277140	I'm assuming it's probably work and life related, he's only posted one video really
277140	281760	in the last couple of months but hopefully he'll get back on track but keep it techy
281760	282760	is great.
282760	286760	If I go to the about tab I can read a little bit of what keep it techy is about, keep it
286760	291440	techy is a technology channel started by Josh and he helps raise awareness about the Linux
291440	296000	operating system, blah blah blah, I won't read the blurb but basically I can tell you
296000	302040	his videos typically are a little more advanced, I won't say too advanced but he does some
302040	307720	server related stuff, of course some desktop related stuff, again he does stuff about audio,
307720	312440	video and Linux, most YouTubers, most Linux YouTubers are going to cover audio and video
312440	315520	on Linux because that's a big part of what we do.
315520	320520	But again a good mix, good mix of content from this guy because I mean he does everything
320520	326880	from really simple basic like installations and simple terminal commands that you should
326880	333560	know all the way into some more advanced server related topics and once again much like old
333560	339520	tech bloke keep it techy, he's got good equipment, he's got a good microphone, his audio is good
339520	346800	and once again he's got a good speaking voice, a good radio voice and that's so important
346800	351960	on YouTube or on radio but especially what we're talking about today YouTube if you
351960	357000	don't have a good speaking voice combined with pretty decent audio equipment nobody's
357000	361960	really going to listen to you and keep it techy definitely deserves more eyeballs on
361960	363480	his stuff.
363480	368440	And the next YouTuber I want to recommend, Linux related, Red Robo's Workshop, Rob does
368440	376320	some good stuff here, he's again got a perfect radio kind of voice, topics, he focuses pretty
376320	382040	heavily at least here lately on OpenSusa as far as his video content, he does a lot of
382040	387440	stuff about KDE, occasionally he does some off topic stuff, he showed his aquarium with
387440	393160	some shrimp in a recent video but Rob's great, Rob's a good community member too, he comments
393160	398800	on a lot of other Linux related YouTube channels, you guys probably seen Red Robo's Workshop
398800	403640	you know posting and my live streams and many other folks live streams when I do a live
403640	405800	stream or whoever.
405800	414320	But Rob is a great guy, great content and deserves far more subscribers than just 361.
414320	420480	Nicholas Bernstein, now Nicholas here is kind of a newer channel again, he's already got
420480	430760	though 549 subscribers once again, good, good voice, good audio, good video and very knowledgeable,
430760	433400	he's a really good teacher.
433400	440840	Like he explains things very well, he focuses on sysadmin, IT kind of stuff, he focuses on
440840	447080	preparing people for that field and again his explanations are great, you know he doesn't
447080	451480	rush through explanations, kind of like I try to do often times on my tutorial videos,
451480	456160	I kind of take my time talking through stuff, I don't just blow through it talking as fast
456160	462760	as I can, because that is kind of antithetical to trying to cheat somebody that has no idea
462760	468000	about what you're talking to and I think Nicholas is a fantastic teacher, deserves far more
468000	474640	subscribers than the 549 he currently has as of recording this video.
474640	482640	Dark One, Dark One Matt is just a fantastic entertaining guy and the great thing about
482720	489720	Dark One here is he focuses on a wide range of topics which I think is a real benefit,
491400	495320	because I think some of these channels that we're talking about today, they stay small
495320	502720	because they focus on a very tight niche as far as a topic where Dark One covers Linux
502720	508680	related stuff, Linux news, Linux Rants, he covers other tech related stuff not related
508680	515680	to Linux, I mean he covers things like Microsoft Surface Tablets and things like that, he talks
516760	522680	even about Mac I think occasionally, of course Windows and of course he does some gaming
522680	529040	stuff, he's a big gamer, covers Windows gaming and Linux gaming and what I really like about
529040	536040	Matt is he's entertaining his hill, he does a lot of reaction videos where he basically
536680	541800	trashes somebody for being dumb, especially people that make really dumb videos about
541800	548800	Linux which I love, so I really love his reaction videos, he does also music video reactions
548800	555800	which are pretty cool and again he's got 821 subscribers as I'm recording this and I think
556840	561400	he deserves far more attention than he's currently getting.
561400	568400	Colin over at PCTLC, now you guys I know many of you guys like when I do my distro review
569560	574400	type videos and I don't do that many of those type videos anymore because I don't find
574400	579760	them that interesting, they don't interest me as far as that's not the content I really
579760	584480	just want to create, but a lot of people out there do want to create that and Colin over
584480	591480	at PCTLC does a great job with those installation videos and review videos, reviewing various
592920	597880	distros, some of the recent ones are Debbie and Tanny's covered probably for the Big Daddy
597880	602880	Linux challenge and they covered Arch, Open Mandreva, most of these are probably following
602880	607480	the schedule of Big Daddy Linux which we may talk about here in a minute, but Colin over
607480	614480	at PCTLC, great guy, just awesome Linux community member and puts out some fantastic content
615680	622280	again, like, subscribe, share, do whatever you can to help out Colin there.
622280	628080	Sudo Reboot, now Sudo Reboot does nothing but live streams as far as I know of and he
628080	634400	does live streams like almost every day and he typically does long live streams typically
634600	641600	an hour, two hours, three hours or more sometimes and he's not your typical, oh I'm just going
641600	647440	to do a live stream and I have absolutely nothing to talk about, no he's great, he
647440	653000	interacts with the YouTube chat and the community but he also has real content on his live streams
653000	659000	like he does Linux-y stuff during his live streams, you know, reviewing distros and
659000	664880	various software programs and things, talks about the news and Sudo Reboot is one of these
664880	671880	guys, he's been around for a long time too as far as on YouTube and I don't know why
672120	679120	he only has 541 subscribers, I think that's criminal, criminally underrated actually,
679720	686720	you guys please go subscribe to Sudo Reboot, he is absolutely fantastic, great guy as well.
687000	692240	Now this is a bit of a bigger channel but I include it in the list because I still think
692240	698360	it's vastly underrated, Destination Linux, the Destination Linux podcast with Zib, Michael,
698360	705120	Dasgeek and Noah is fantastic, so they put out a weekly podcast and you know typically
705120	710160	about two hours long, they record it live, typically you can watch the live recording
710160	714960	and then they go back and edit it and post it a couple of days after the live recording
715000	722000	as far as the edited podcast version of Destination Linux, but I think it's maybe the premiere
723680	728840	Linux podcast out there and you know they got a pretty good subscriber base, you know
728840	734560	over 4,000 subscribers but I do think that that's very underrated and I think there's
734560	739240	probably a lot of you guys that are watching this video here that probably have not heard
739240	744840	of Destination Linux and if you have not heard of Destination Linux, please check it out,
745720	752000	Big Daddy Linux, we were talking about that a minute ago with PCTLC, how his distro reviews
752000	758800	cover usually the weekly distro review from Big Daddy Linux live, Big Daddy Linux live
758800	765800	is a weekly live show, every Saturday night you get a couple of dozen people joining live
765800	770640	on a video conference, anybody's free to join, anybody from the community can join them live
770680	776080	on camera, plus you've got a couple of hundred people joining them live in the YouTube chat
776080	782680	every Saturday night and it is great, it is one of the great community things going on
782680	789680	as far as Linux YouTube community, Rocco Big Daddy Linux is really one of the leaders
790200	797200	as far as the Linux YouTube community, he really brings people together in a way nobody
798200	805200	else is doing and I really want to commend Rocco, I think he is just, I can't say enough
805280	810800	about how important Rocco Big Daddy Linux is to the Linux YouTube community so definitely
810800	815560	subscribe, check out Big Daddy Linux live every Saturday night and here lately Rocco has been
815560	822040	doing these Linux spotlights where he interviews people from the community, Linux YouTubers,
822040	826800	Linux developers, just Linux personalities, he's been doing that and those shows are
826840	833440	great as well, check out Big Daddy Linux, again another bigger channel but I think is
833440	840440	just woefully underrated is HexDSL, HexDSL has over 5,000 subscribers, definitely the
841400	846480	biggest channel I'm covering today but I think this guy should have 10 times the subscriber
846480	853000	base, great guy, Hex is just fantastic, he's entertaining, fun to watch, does pre-recorded
853040	859440	stuff, does live streaming, good content, good mix of content, focuses heavily on Linux
859440	866440	gaming which is why the subscriber base is not that high so Linux itself is a really
866880	872320	niche topic, if you have a channel that focuses primarily on Linux you're not going to get
872320	876920	that many subscribers, there's just not enough of us Linux users out there, if you focus
876920	883640	on Linux gaming as a topic, wow that's a niche inside a niche and I think that's part
883640	889000	of the problem but don't let the topic of the channel fool you, I mean he is focusing
889000	894840	heavily on Linux gaming but he does a mix of content, he looks at various terminal applications
894840	899400	recently he did a video about Ranger, I know he's covered various tiling window managers
899400	905000	on his show, sometimes he does tutorials, he shows you how to do things like in the
905000	910240	shell and things like that, so there is some tutorial stuff, some nerdy stuff other than
910240	916840	just the gaming stuff and I find his content some of the best out there, I try to catch
916840	922040	as much of Hex DSL's videos as I can, I can't watch everybody, I don't have time to watch
922040	927080	every video from everybody I'm subscribed to but when Hex puts out something I typically
927080	933640	watch it and I think you guys really if you're not subscribed check him out, well that was
933640	938760	the last Linux related channel but I wanted to cover two channels that really aren't
938760	944600	Linux centric but they're pretty close to Linux that I wanted to cover them, first of all Robo
944600	951880	Nuggy, everything free BSD, yes this is a BSD channel and that is why he doesn't have that
951880	957000	many views and subscribers is because think about how niche Linux is, now think about how
957000	965240	niche BSD is, like we probably have a hundred times more Linux users than BSD users and so
965240	972360	just he's fighting an uphill battle as far as getting views and subscribers but if you are
972360	979800	interested in BSD at all please subscribe to Robo Nuggy, even if you're not that interested in BSD
979800	985880	I mean some of what he talks about is applicable to those of us that run Linux on the desktop and
985880	993960	especially Linux as a server so please check out Robo Nuggy and Greg Hurrell, now a bigger
993960	1000680	channel he's got over 4,000 subscribers this is not strictly Linux content though, his content is
1000680	1006760	Vim, he covers the Vim text editor, many of you guys are probably interested in Vim, I know I
1006760	1012360	cover Vim a lot on my channel you guys ask me about Vim a lot, you're looking for good content
1012360	1021320	centered around Vim, you know if you're a potential programmer developer and you're looking to harness
1021320	1029000	the power of Vim please subscribe to Greg Hurrell, a little bit off the beaten path with the Vim
1029000	1034600	centric channel Greg Hurrell and the free BSD centric channel with Robo Nuggy but I think all
1034600	1040440	those guys deserve a ton of views but obviously some of the bigger channels that I didn't cover
1040440	1045240	because they get covered a lot I mean you guys can check out everybody I'm subscribed to there's
1045240	1049960	always a chance you haven't heard of some of the bigger channels I'm subscribed to I would tell
1049960	1056120	you I'm often shocked like when I do if I do a colab with somebody even a bigger channel and you
1056120	1061240	think so much of our content you know I did a colab one time with Luke Smith and you would think
1061240	1067480	most people that watch my stuff have heard of Luke Smith but no I had people it's like who is Luke
1067480	1072520	Smith when I announced that I was gonna do that colab with Luke I'm sure Luke had a ton of people
1072520	1078040	that watch his stuff that had never heard of me so just because they're bigger channels I know some
1078040	1083160	of you guys probably have never heard of you know Chris Titus Tech and tutorial links and some of
1083160	1090040	these really big channels just go to my youtube page click the channels tab and anybody that you
1090040	1095800	haven't heard of that I'm subscribed to please check them out all great channels and I think
1096520	1103160	because of the community aspect we really want all these people to grow as content creators
1103160	1108120	because at the end of the day what we really want is more awareness we want to spread more
1108120	1115400	awareness about this thing we love that is Linux and before I go this show was made possible by
1115400	1120440	Ansem first Chris second Chris Dylan George Jack Mitchell Natek Philip Rob Robert Tony Sam and
1120440	1125160	Willie the producers of the show they are my highest tier patrons over on patreon without
1125160	1129960	these guys this show would not be possible I also want to thank each and every one of those names
1129960	1135000	you see on the screen that ever growing list of names those are the list of supporters I have over
1135000	1140440	on patreon these guys they keep the lights on they keep the channel going I want to sincerely
1140440	1145320	thank each and every one of you guys you'd like to support the channel please consider doing so
1145320	1156440	you'll find me at distro tube over on patreon okay guys peace
