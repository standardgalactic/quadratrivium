00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
Well this year has been strange as far as weather down here in Louisiana. We've

00:05.240 --> 00:10.440
had some severe weather during the spring, during the summer, during the fall,

00:10.440 --> 00:14.440
and it's getting kind of crazy here in the winter too. I don't know. It's like

00:14.440 --> 00:19.280
the world is coming to an end, right? All this climate change or whatever. It's

00:19.280 --> 00:24.400
for real, I guess. But anyway, today I wanted to talk to you guys about evolving

00:24.400 --> 00:28.720
as a Linux user. Because sometimes people ask me how I ended up on things like

00:28.720 --> 00:34.040
Arch Linux or Vim or Emacs or how did I get into the terminal and things like

00:34.040 --> 00:37.640
that. And now one of the things with Linux, there's typically two types of

00:37.640 --> 00:42.880
users. There's those that they just want to install something quick and easy and

00:42.880 --> 00:47.080
use it as is. They never want to look under the hood and figure out how it

00:47.080 --> 00:52.520
works. And then there's the other group of Linux users that is the tinkers. They

00:52.520 --> 00:56.160
do want to know how everything works. They want to take things apart and put it

00:56.160 --> 01:01.800
back together again. And because, you know, Linux is full of these nerds that

01:01.800 --> 01:06.040
like to tear things down and build it again. And that's why so many of us

01:06.040 --> 01:10.960
gravitate toward, I guess, not user-friendly distributions like Arch

01:10.960 --> 01:16.280
Linux and the hundreds of distros based on Arch Linux or Gen2 and the various

01:16.280 --> 01:22.080
distributions based on Gen2 and things like that Slackware. And, you know, that's

01:22.080 --> 01:26.080
okay if you're not there yet. I think a lot of people, when they first come to

01:26.080 --> 01:31.400
Linux, they install Ubuntu or Linux Mint. And then, you know, they, I guess, feel

01:31.400 --> 01:36.320
intimidated by those that have gotten past the point of needing to use

01:36.320 --> 01:40.240
something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. And it's not, it's really not about

01:40.240 --> 01:46.000
elitism or arrogance or anything like that. Many of us use Arch Linux. It's

01:46.000 --> 01:52.200
because for what we do, using Arch or an Arch based Linux distribution is much,

01:52.240 --> 01:57.720
much easier for us than using something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint or OpenSUSA.

01:57.720 --> 02:04.080
Why is that? Well, when you're new, you're not going to be doing a lot of crazy

02:04.080 --> 02:08.720
things, right? Like compiling your own software, doing extreme customizations of

02:08.720 --> 02:12.720
your desktop or window manager and things like that. Typically, you just want

02:12.720 --> 02:16.640
something that's really easy and quick to install and looks good out of the box.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.040
And then you're not going to touch it, you know, when you're a brand new user. And

02:20.320 --> 02:25.000
that's okay. Once you get more advanced, though, you really want to build your own

02:25.000 --> 02:29.840
system, right? And it becomes very limiting when you use something like Ubuntu or

02:29.840 --> 02:34.320
Mint, you know, as opposed to something like Arch Linux, because let's take Ubuntu,

02:34.320 --> 02:39.120
for example. Ubuntu comes with its own very customized GNOME desktop environment.

02:39.120 --> 02:44.600
And if you want to hack on it a little bit and change things, it's tough. Ubuntu

02:44.600 --> 02:48.920
makes it really tough. Also, their desktop and the suite of applications,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.960
everything is really tightly integrated together. And sometimes you can't separate

02:53.960 --> 02:59.680
those pieces, because like the Ubuntu desktop is really almost like a meta

02:59.680 --> 03:05.240
package, a collection of things. And sometimes it's really hard to separate

03:05.240 --> 03:09.040
some of the stuff you don't want on the system from the stuff you do, because

03:09.400 --> 03:12.720
just the way these user friendly distributions are built, they package

03:12.720 --> 03:18.160
things in such a way. It's really, again, it's designed for the brand new user.

03:18.600 --> 03:24.360
But for those of us that want to do more than just the real basics, Ubuntu

03:24.360 --> 03:31.120
is hard. It's frustrating to use. I mean, it's, I save so much time using

03:31.360 --> 03:37.040
Arch based distributions compared to Ubuntu, because unlike Ubuntu and Mint

03:37.040 --> 03:43.680
and SUSE, you know, Arch Linux has no, they don't have a dog in the fight as

03:43.680 --> 03:47.040
far as what they do with their desktop environments. If you want a desktop

03:47.040 --> 03:50.480
environment or a window manager, you install the one you choose, it's not

03:50.480 --> 03:55.440
going to be themed or customized in any way, unless you do it. And a lot of new

03:55.440 --> 03:59.320
users think, well, that's crazy. I've got to put in all this work once I install

03:59.320 --> 04:03.920
this window manager desktop environment. Yeah. But you know, that's, that's

04:03.920 --> 04:08.080
what some of us signed up for. Plus, you only really have to do it one time. You

04:08.080 --> 04:12.520
set up your window manager the way you want, save the configs. And you always

04:12.520 --> 04:17.000
have your own configs after that. It's always your desktop environment. If

04:17.000 --> 04:21.800
you will, that you always reinstall. There's no reason to, to go to something

04:21.800 --> 04:26.760
like Ubuntu and have to fight Ubuntu trying to take things apart and put it

04:26.760 --> 04:30.240
back together the way you want. And that's one of the real things about

04:30.240 --> 04:34.080
Arch Linux. That's why the Arch philosophy, they talk about Arch Linux

04:34.080 --> 04:39.000
being simple, right? Arch Linux, the Arch philosophy is all about simplicity.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.640
And a lot of people think, well, that's Arch is not simple because it's not

04:43.640 --> 04:48.800
user friendly. Well, simple doesn't mean user friendly. Simple means everything

04:48.960 --> 04:54.240
is simple by design, right? All the pieces have been separated, you know,

04:54.240 --> 04:58.040
until they're smallest components, basically, and you pick and choose the

04:58.040 --> 05:02.640
parts you want, and you build that thing the way you want to make it look. I

05:02.640 --> 05:06.760
think another reason that Arch Linux is great is because it's rolling release,

05:06.760 --> 05:10.800
right? Rolling release has really caught on. When I started in Linux, you know,

05:10.800 --> 05:15.320
12, 13 years ago, as far as desktop use, rolling releases were seen as kind of a

05:15.320 --> 05:20.880
niche. Nobody took them seriously. Nobody thought they were quote stable. You

05:20.880 --> 05:26.000
didn't see people running them on a server ever like that was unheard of. And

05:26.000 --> 05:30.640
really, people are starting to come around to the idea of rolling releases

05:30.760 --> 05:36.200
being the better model as opposed to static release distributions. I think

05:36.360 --> 05:41.160
Arch Linux has really changed the game there. I think there's a reason why

05:41.160 --> 05:45.800
you're seeing Ubuntu. Ubuntu's popularity is starting to seriously decline.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.800
People don't talk about it as much. I don't talk about it that often. Really,

05:50.040 --> 05:54.640
unless Ubuntu has a big release, I don't talk about it much on the YouTube

05:54.640 --> 05:58.560
channel. Why? There's really not much to say about it. That's not, that's not

05:58.560 --> 06:01.800
where all the innovation is happening these days. That's not where the action

06:01.840 --> 06:07.480
is. The action is really these days, Arch, right? Arch dominates the desktop

06:07.480 --> 06:11.600
Linux world, all the Arch based distributions. Manjaro is exploding in

06:11.600 --> 06:16.760
popularity. Arco Linux is exploding in popularity. Mainstream Arch, even though

06:16.760 --> 06:21.960
it's a command line, is exploding in popularity. There is a ton of people

06:22.360 --> 06:27.320
giving Arch Linux a serious try that otherwise wouldn't have, say, five and

06:27.320 --> 06:31.520
definitely 10 years ago. Some of the other benefits of Arch Linux, you know,

06:31.520 --> 06:38.640
why it has gained ground over things like Ubuntu and Debian and Mint is their

06:38.640 --> 06:43.760
pragmatic stance as far as the repository of software. You know, Arch Linux

06:44.000 --> 06:49.800
does not mind putting proprietary software in its repositories. They, they

06:49.800 --> 06:56.800
are not free software only purists. Now, I'm a free software zealot, but even I

06:56.800 --> 07:00.560
as a free software zealot don't mind them having proprietary software

07:00.560 --> 07:05.400
available for their users in their repositories. What I hate is Linux

07:05.400 --> 07:09.120
distributions that install proprietary software out of the box on those

07:09.240 --> 07:12.880
distributions, you know, and basically they're trying to force proprietary

07:12.880 --> 07:16.640
software on their users. I don't like that, but I don't mind proprietary

07:16.640 --> 07:21.080
software being in the repos available for those that need it and want to use it

07:21.080 --> 07:25.280
because not everybody cares about the free software movement. I get that. So I

07:25.280 --> 07:31.120
actually like the pragmatic stance that Arch Linux takes in that regard. And again,

07:31.120 --> 07:36.000
I think that helps with Arch Linux becoming so popular is the fact that

07:36.200 --> 07:41.720
there's so much software available on Arch Linux that is tougher to get even

07:41.720 --> 07:46.160
on things like Ubuntu. There's, there's stuff that I install that, you know, I

07:46.160 --> 07:49.560
have no problems installing on Arch Linux because I know I can find it in the

07:49.560 --> 07:55.200
Arch repositories or in the AUR, the Arch user repository, or with Arch Linux, you

07:55.200 --> 08:00.560
also have flatpacks, snaps, app images available if you want to use them. And

08:00.560 --> 08:04.840
that's the other thing. They're not forced on you either. With Ubuntu, snap is

08:04.840 --> 08:08.780
pre-installed, you're expected to use snaps. With Linux Mint, they have flatpack

08:08.780 --> 08:13.020
installed and you're expected to use flatpacks. Well, with Arch Linux, nothing

08:13.020 --> 08:16.920
is installed. If you want to use snaps, install it and set it up, you're free to

08:16.920 --> 08:21.080
do so. Same thing with flatpack. If you want to use flatpack, install it, use it,

08:21.120 --> 08:25.040
you're free to do so, but they don't care if you use it. They don't care if you

08:25.200 --> 08:30.720
don't use it. And I think that's the better model. I think, again, I think we're

08:30.720 --> 08:36.600
starting to see this real shift in desktop Linux where really what used to

08:36.600 --> 08:42.760
be in a Ubuntu-dominated game is really now dominated by Arch Linux. And I love

08:42.760 --> 08:47.480
it. I love it because Arch Linux, of course, is a community distribution too.

08:47.480 --> 08:52.760
It's not corporate backed. There's no company really calling the shots. It's

08:52.760 --> 08:58.120
all about us, the community building something great. And I think it's a

08:58.120 --> 09:04.080
model that works. Anyway, that's enough of me rambling and walking around here

09:04.080 --> 09:07.560
in the snow. I don't even know what in the hell I was gonna talk about when I

09:07.560 --> 09:11.880
turned on the camera. I just started walking around and talking. I hope some

09:11.880 --> 09:17.320
of this incoherent mess that I said makes sense at least when I put it on

09:17.320 --> 09:21.840
YouTube. If it doesn't, I do apologize, but you got to understand it's about 20

09:21.840 --> 09:28.200
degrees right now, and I am freezing my balls off. Alright guys, peace.
