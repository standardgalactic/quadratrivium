0	9600	Why all the hate for Ubuntu? Why is it when you talk Linux in Linux forms,
9600	17200	IRC chats, various social media sites, why is it anytime Ubuntu comes up all the haters also show up?
17760	25040	Ubuntu has a ton of shade that is thrown at it and is it deserved? That's the topic for today.
25680	32080	So in my opinion I think that the Ubuntu haters do so mainly for one of two
32080	38080	reasons and I'm talking about broadly speaking one of two reasons. They either hate on Ubuntu
38080	46240	due to elitism you know that superiority complex tribalism or they do it because they see Ubuntu
46240	52640	as going in the wrong direction that Ubuntu as a project canonical as a company the company behind
52640	59520	Ubuntu is misguided and they're going in a direction that is just wrong wrong for Linux wrong
59520	66400	for free and open source software so let me tackle both of those topics. Let's start with the ones
66400	72640	that hate on Ubuntu because of elitism. Ubuntu of course is considered a new user-friendly
72640	78880	distribution certainly many if not most Linux users new to Linux users they start out with Ubuntu.
78880	84560	I did most of you guys did it's the most popular desktop Linux distribution it's certainly one of
84560	90160	the easiest to get installed and working out of the box especially nowadays when I first used it
90160	97200	12 13 years ago you know there was some little bugs and paper cuts in it but nowadays for the most
97200	101840	part Linux has gotten a lot better these things are just so easy to install you click okay three
101840	107040	or four times 10 minutes you're done but when Ubuntu first came on the scene you know there
107040	113280	weren't a lot of these easy to install new user-friendly distros and Ubuntu became very popular
113280	119520	very quickly and I think this really led to some of these haters the the Linux users that are hating
119520	125600	on it maybe because they have this this feeling of superiority to all those Ubuntu noobs especially
125600	130960	once you move to a different distribution right because you start out with Ubuntu and then you
130960	137040	hop a little bit right and you feel like you graduate to the next level because you move to
137040	143680	Demian or Fedora or Arch or Slackware whatever it is you move to and you feel like you're a better
143680	150560	Linux user than that Ubuntu noob you know he's still just a a Linux peasant because he's on that
150560	156160	easy distribution my distribution I had to work a little bit to get this thing installed now it's
156240	162480	certainly easy to be like that to be that elitist arrogant snob that a-hole right especially if you
162480	169920	started on Ubuntu and then you moved away to another distro I can see how you could be tempted to act
169920	176880	that way and because now you see that you've climbed this wrong on a ladder to this next level you
176880	181200	you keep climbing that ladder and you think eventually you're going to achieve elite status
181200	186720	because you're now using more of a quote power users distro you're not on that easy distro you're
186720	192240	not using noob Ubuntu and so now you want to flex a little right you want to tell all those Ubuntu
192240	197680	peasants how much better you are because you're running Arch now or whatever it is you haven't
197680	204640	been running so you guys though don't you got to understand that the elitists out there that are
204640	209680	out there spouting this nonsense just don't listen to them don't give them the time of day don't
209760	214800	respond to them they're just trolls at the end of the day distro choice doesn't matter it doesn't
214800	219360	matter what those guys are running it doesn't matter what you're running their distro of choice
219360	225920	isn't superior to yours and if you're running Ubuntu Ubuntu isn't inferior to those other distros
225920	231120	that those elitists are running now you guys know my mantra for the channel has always been if it's
231120	237600	working for you use it and for millions tens of millions of Linux users out there Ubuntu is working
237600	242800	just fine for them so use it use the right tool for the right job is another one I always say
242800	249840	and certainly for casual desktop computer users Ubuntu is a fantastic choice so the second group
249840	255280	of haters I want to address are the ones that think Ubuntu is going in the wrong direction that
255280	262800	everything Ubuntu does everything canonical does is the wrong thing and it really what really started
262800	272960	it all I think was around 2010 when GNOME 2 reached end of life and GNOME was moving to GNOME 3
273520	279840	and Ubuntu decided to create their own desktop environment called Unity because GNOME 3 was
279840	285280	horrible they didn't want to go that direction most users didn't want to go to GNOME 3 anyway
285280	289680	you couldn't still use GNOME 2 I mean you could but it's no longer being developed no longer being
289680	293840	supported so canonical was like well you know what we'll create our own desktop environment we're
293840	299600	going to create Unity and the first couple of versions of Unity were quite buggy but you know
299600	306560	it got really good really quickly like you know after about a year of development Unity really
306560	312720	became quite stable and to be honest Unity was popular like again millions and millions of
312720	320400	Ubuntu users out there and they many Ubuntu users if you installed Ubuntu past say 2011
320400	326240	all you knew was the Unity desktop environment you never knew the old GNOME 2 desktop anyway
326240	333040	and for many of those users when a Unity went away they were really upset why is because they
333040	338640	loved Unity so Unity really wasn't a hated desktop environment there's a few people that didn't like
338640	342240	it because there's always going to be people out there that resist change there were people that
342240	350320	loved GNOME 2 and once GNOME 2 went away we got to be angry at somebody but being angry at canonical
350320	358800	or being angry at Ubuntu for the death of GNOME 2 is quite frankly retarded right the GNOME project
358800	364240	ended GNOME 2 and moved to GNOME 3 if you want to be angry about the death of GNOME 2
365120	370160	you know direct that anger to the right people and the Ubuntu devs are not the people you should
370160	376080	have been angry at another big controversy that people really hate Ubuntu about was when
376080	382480	during the Unity years they had the Amazon lens and you know there was some telemetry in that
382480	386880	because it's connecting to Amazon Amazon's tracking some of what you're searching because
386880	392960	it's a search feature and people called it spyware which is ridiculous it's not spyware I mean if
392960	398480	that's spyware then every time you use the Google search engine Google spyware every time you fire
398560	403920	up something like Steam or Netflix anything like that I mean they're tracking everything you do too
403920	411520	I mean nobody calls Steam spyware or Netflix spyware but Ubuntu has this Amazon search
411520	417520	lens in Unity and now all of a sudden Ubuntu is spyware I mean how ridiculous is that now the
417520	423040	Amazon lens thing I didn't personally like it and a lot of people complained about it because
423040	428640	it was kind of buggy and it was just kind of clunky anyway and the Ubuntu folks did listen
428640	434320	and they created the ability to turn that thing off and uninstall it but a lot of people years later
435120	441280	way past when they got rid of the Amazon lens and when Unity died people are still talking about
441280	448400	the Amazon spyware in Ubuntu guys check yourselves and then there are the people that love to bring
448720	455760	that canonical and Ubuntu have the NIH syndrome the not invented here syndrome
456480	461440	basically that Ubuntu and canonical they're always trying to reinvent the wheel you know
461440	467120	instead of creating their own desktop environment and a knit system and display server and package
467120	473280	manager and yada yada yada they should just use what's already out there they should just use the
473360	478000	products that these other distributions have created instead of creating their own it's just
478000	482080	duplication of work and the only reason they're doing it is because they're jealous of those
482080	487440	other projects and they don't want to use this superior technology they want to create their
487440	492640	own thing because they can't admit that red hat made something better or susa made something better
492640	497600	or whatever the distro is out there so people love to bring up you know things like upstart
497600	508240	Unity, mirror, snap packages as being a symptom of the not invented here syndrome okay so real
508240	515600	talk here when canonical and Ubuntu created upstart there were no other knit systems out
515600	521600	there other than sysv you know and of course gen2 was I think still using open rc still are
521600	528080	but we didn't have system d back then right and so saying that upstart that canonical created
528080	535200	upstart for a not invented here kind of scenario is ridiculous because they had already been using
535200	541440	sysv and yet initially and then they created upstart to move to upstart and guess what red hat
541440	547840	thought so highly of upstart that they shipped with upstart in those particular versions of
547920	552560	rail back then the red hat enterprise linux and a lot of people don't realize that that rail
552560	557840	actually did ship with upstart until of course red hat created system d but a lot of people were
557840	562560	like well canonical is just inventing a new and a knit system they should have just been using system
562560	569360	d system d didn't exist when they first started creating and developing upstart the unity desktop
569360	576160	environment again gen2 died they had to go a different direction no matter what direction
576160	582160	they went might as well create unity you didn't want to go to genome 3 genome 3 was garbage and
582160	587760	it was going to be a completely foreign interface to everybody as well besides not invented here
587760	594560	i mean every desktop environment project on the planet whether it's genome kde xsce lxq
595520	601120	mate cinnamon i guess they all suffer from not invented here syndrome because why are they
601120	605520	creating new desktop environments just pick one of the ones already out there right i mean
605520	612480	that argument's just stupid the mirror display server weyland was being developed then 10 years
612480	618160	ago but weyland wasn't ready and what canonical created mirror for is because they were doing
618160	625520	the phone they wanted a display server that could work across all devices phone desktop tablet
626080	631120	weyland couldn't do that so they created mirror and then snap packages people love to complain
631120	636800	about snap packages and some people complain maybe ubuntu should just drop snaps and go with flat
636800	643840	pack which okay and you ask them you know why should ubuntu do that is because ubuntu is doing the
643840	648720	not invented here thing they should just go with the standard the standard is flat pack ubuntu
648720	654560	created snaps before flat pack or app images even existed they started working on snaps actually way
654560	660960	back in the ubuntu phone days they were called click packages back then so again this is not a
660960	666480	not invented here type scenario and i think the whole not invented here argument is just stupid
666480	672880	that's why i've never uttered that phrase before making this video you will never see me talk about
672880	680560	not invented here and writing or on video because it's a stupid argument free and open source
680560	687680	software everything we do could be accused of being part of not invented here in recent years
687680	692960	you know people love to bring up the telemetry in ubuntu as far as they're asking for telemetry
692960	697200	information when you first install it they want to know some information about your computer what
697200	702480	hardware you're running you know the resolution of your monitor things like that and they ask you for
702480	709600	permission upfront it's not sneaky or it's not shady in any way they basically tell you exactly
709600	714880	what they want to know from you and you can actually go and read the reports of that telemetry
714880	720240	that they're getting from the users and i hear people compare that kind of telemetry that ubuntu
720240	724800	is upfront asking you about hey we just want to know what what the specs of your hardware are
724800	732080	i hear people comparing that to the spyware that is built into windows 10 now over exaggerate much
732640	738960	i think a lot of this has to do with this tribalism you know it's ubuntu is so popular and you guys
738960	744800	that are not running ubuntu i'm not running ubuntu but you know you're running a less popular
744800	750400	distribution right maybe a really small distribution that most people haven't heard of it doesn't have
750400	756640	that much of a user base and you think maybe by tearing down ubuntu a little bit you can grab
756640	762000	some of those users and bring it over to you know joe bob's distro or whatever it is you happen to be
762000	767440	running and if you're gonna try to steal users you know from another distribution by tearing it down
767440	773360	you're going to go for the most popular one every time that is just common sense that's just human
773360	778240	nature right you want to punch up you don't want to punch down you want to go for the guy on top
778240	783840	you're not going to beat up the guy on bottom nobody i've never seen a thread that somebody
783840	791040	started on how bad something like nitrix linux is or voyage or linux or sparky linux and then have
791040	796320	hundreds of people join that thread and trash it yeah it's so horrible nobody cares right because
796320	802320	those distros they don't have much of a user base why bother right but ubuntu is so much more popular
802320	809120	than all the other linux distributions that's the one you go after me personally i like ubuntu
809120	816080	i started as an ubuntu user i've used ubuntu on many machines over the years i still use ubuntu
816080	822640	on web servers all the time if ubuntu lts server is offered as an option i almost always go with it
822720	828640	when i have family and friends that have windows machines that they want to wipe out and move to
828640	834640	linux because windows is slow and now it's all virus riddled on their their laptops and nothing
834640	841360	is working you know a lot of times i put ubuntu or some ubuntu base distribution on those machines
841360	847360	and every single person i put on ubuntu on a new machine you know never seen linux before they
847360	852400	they just loved it they're blown away even if i told them about all these complaints that people
852400	858640	have they wouldn't care because what do they care about gnometoo going away and unity coming around
858640	866160	you know that that ship is done sealed we're past that chapter the amazon lens and unity like none
866160	871280	of this stuff even matters anymore and it's just strange that people still bring this up
873040	878400	now before i go this show was made possible by chris dj donnie dylan george heplenate lambda
878400	883680	michael michael omri rob shawning willy the producers of the show these guys they're my
883680	889600	highest tiered patrons over on patreon without these guys this episode me addressing why so many
889600	894080	people throw shade on ubuntu this this episode wouldn't have been possible the show is also
894080	898240	brought to you by all these other names you're seeing on the screen right now all those guys
898240	902960	they help support me over on patreon if you'd like to support the channel look for distro tube
902960	908960	over on patreon all right guys peace
