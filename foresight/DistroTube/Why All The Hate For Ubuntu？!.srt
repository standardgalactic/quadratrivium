1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Why all the hate for Ubuntu? Why is it when you talk Linux in Linux forms,

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:17,200
IRC chats, various social media sites, why is it anytime Ubuntu comes up all the haters also show up?

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,040
Ubuntu has a ton of shade that is thrown at it and is it deserved? That's the topic for today.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,080
So in my opinion I think that the Ubuntu haters do so mainly for one of two

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,080
reasons and I'm talking about broadly speaking one of two reasons. They either hate on Ubuntu

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:46,240
due to elitism you know that superiority complex tribalism or they do it because they see Ubuntu

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,640
as going in the wrong direction that Ubuntu as a project canonical as a company the company behind

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,520
Ubuntu is misguided and they're going in a direction that is just wrong wrong for Linux wrong

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,400
for free and open source software so let me tackle both of those topics. Let's start with the ones

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,640
that hate on Ubuntu because of elitism. Ubuntu of course is considered a new user-friendly

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,880
distribution certainly many if not most Linux users new to Linux users they start out with Ubuntu.

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,560
I did most of you guys did it's the most popular desktop Linux distribution it's certainly one of

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,160
the easiest to get installed and working out of the box especially nowadays when I first used it

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,200
12 13 years ago you know there was some little bugs and paper cuts in it but nowadays for the most

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
part Linux has gotten a lot better these things are just so easy to install you click okay three

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
or four times 10 minutes you're done but when Ubuntu first came on the scene you know there

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,280
weren't a lot of these easy to install new user-friendly distros and Ubuntu became very popular

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,520
very quickly and I think this really led to some of these haters the the Linux users that are hating

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,600
on it maybe because they have this this feeling of superiority to all those Ubuntu noobs especially

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,960
once you move to a different distribution right because you start out with Ubuntu and then you

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,040
hop a little bit right and you feel like you graduate to the next level because you move to

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,680
Demian or Fedora or Arch or Slackware whatever it is you move to and you feel like you're a better

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,560
Linux user than that Ubuntu noob you know he's still just a a Linux peasant because he's on that

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,160
easy distribution my distribution I had to work a little bit to get this thing installed now it's

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,480
certainly easy to be like that to be that elitist arrogant snob that a-hole right especially if you

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,920
started on Ubuntu and then you moved away to another distro I can see how you could be tempted to act

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,880
that way and because now you see that you've climbed this wrong on a ladder to this next level you

28
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,200
you keep climbing that ladder and you think eventually you're going to achieve elite status

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,720
because you're now using more of a quote power users distro you're not on that easy distro you're

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,240
not using noob Ubuntu and so now you want to flex a little right you want to tell all those Ubuntu

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,680
peasants how much better you are because you're running Arch now or whatever it is you haven't

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,640
been running so you guys though don't you got to understand that the elitists out there that are

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,680
out there spouting this nonsense just don't listen to them don't give them the time of day don't

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,800
respond to them they're just trolls at the end of the day distro choice doesn't matter it doesn't

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,360
matter what those guys are running it doesn't matter what you're running their distro of choice

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,920
isn't superior to yours and if you're running Ubuntu Ubuntu isn't inferior to those other distros

37
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,120
that those elitists are running now you guys know my mantra for the channel has always been if it's

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,600
working for you use it and for millions tens of millions of Linux users out there Ubuntu is working

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,800
just fine for them so use it use the right tool for the right job is another one I always say

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,840
and certainly for casual desktop computer users Ubuntu is a fantastic choice so the second group

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
of haters I want to address are the ones that think Ubuntu is going in the wrong direction that

42
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,800
everything Ubuntu does everything canonical does is the wrong thing and it really what really started

43
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:32,960
it all I think was around 2010 when GNOME 2 reached end of life and GNOME was moving to GNOME 3

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,840
and Ubuntu decided to create their own desktop environment called Unity because GNOME 3 was

45
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,280
horrible they didn't want to go that direction most users didn't want to go to GNOME 3 anyway

46
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,680
you couldn't still use GNOME 2 I mean you could but it's no longer being developed no longer being

47
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,840
supported so canonical was like well you know what we'll create our own desktop environment we're

48
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,600
going to create Unity and the first couple of versions of Unity were quite buggy but you know

49
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,560
it got really good really quickly like you know after about a year of development Unity really

50
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,720
became quite stable and to be honest Unity was popular like again millions and millions of

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,400
Ubuntu users out there and they many Ubuntu users if you installed Ubuntu past say 2011

52
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,240
all you knew was the Unity desktop environment you never knew the old GNOME 2 desktop anyway

53
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,040
and for many of those users when a Unity went away they were really upset why is because they

54
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,640
loved Unity so Unity really wasn't a hated desktop environment there's a few people that didn't like

55
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,240
it because there's always going to be people out there that resist change there were people that

56
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:50,320
loved GNOME 2 and once GNOME 2 went away we got to be angry at somebody but being angry at canonical

57
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,800
or being angry at Ubuntu for the death of GNOME 2 is quite frankly retarded right the GNOME project

58
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,240
ended GNOME 2 and moved to GNOME 3 if you want to be angry about the death of GNOME 2

59
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,160
you know direct that anger to the right people and the Ubuntu devs are not the people you should

60
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,080
have been angry at another big controversy that people really hate Ubuntu about was when

61
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,480
during the Unity years they had the Amazon lens and you know there was some telemetry in that

62
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,880
because it's connecting to Amazon Amazon's tracking some of what you're searching because

63
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,960
it's a search feature and people called it spyware which is ridiculous it's not spyware I mean if

64
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,480
that's spyware then every time you use the Google search engine Google spyware every time you fire

65
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,920
up something like Steam or Netflix anything like that I mean they're tracking everything you do too

66
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,520
I mean nobody calls Steam spyware or Netflix spyware but Ubuntu has this Amazon search

67
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,520
lens in Unity and now all of a sudden Ubuntu is spyware I mean how ridiculous is that now the

68
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,040
Amazon lens thing I didn't personally like it and a lot of people complained about it because

69
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,640
it was kind of buggy and it was just kind of clunky anyway and the Ubuntu folks did listen

70
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,320
and they created the ability to turn that thing off and uninstall it but a lot of people years later

71
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,280
way past when they got rid of the Amazon lens and when Unity died people are still talking about

72
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,400
the Amazon spyware in Ubuntu guys check yourselves and then there are the people that love to bring

73
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,760
that canonical and Ubuntu have the NIH syndrome the not invented here syndrome

74
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,440
basically that Ubuntu and canonical they're always trying to reinvent the wheel you know

75
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,120
instead of creating their own desktop environment and a knit system and display server and package

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,280
manager and yada yada yada they should just use what's already out there they should just use the

77
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,000
products that these other distributions have created instead of creating their own it's just

78
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,080
duplication of work and the only reason they're doing it is because they're jealous of those

79
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,440
other projects and they don't want to use this superior technology they want to create their

80
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,640
own thing because they can't admit that red hat made something better or susa made something better

81
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,600
or whatever the distro is out there so people love to bring up you know things like upstart

82
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:28,240
Unity, mirror, snap packages as being a symptom of the not invented here syndrome okay so real

83
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,600
talk here when canonical and Ubuntu created upstart there were no other knit systems out

84
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,600
there other than sysv you know and of course gen2 was I think still using open rc still are

85
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,080
but we didn't have system d back then right and so saying that upstart that canonical created

86
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,200
upstart for a not invented here kind of scenario is ridiculous because they had already been using

87
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,440
sysv and yet initially and then they created upstart to move to upstart and guess what red hat

88
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,840
thought so highly of upstart that they shipped with upstart in those particular versions of

89
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,560
rail back then the red hat enterprise linux and a lot of people don't realize that that rail

90
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,840
actually did ship with upstart until of course red hat created system d but a lot of people were

91
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,560
like well canonical is just inventing a new and a knit system they should have just been using system

92
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,360
d system d didn't exist when they first started creating and developing upstart the unity desktop

93
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,160
environment again gen2 died they had to go a different direction no matter what direction

94
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,160
they went might as well create unity you didn't want to go to genome 3 genome 3 was garbage and

95
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,760
it was going to be a completely foreign interface to everybody as well besides not invented here

96
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,560
i mean every desktop environment project on the planet whether it's genome kde xsce lxq

97
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,120
mate cinnamon i guess they all suffer from not invented here syndrome because why are they

98
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,520
creating new desktop environments just pick one of the ones already out there right i mean

99
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,480
that argument's just stupid the mirror display server weyland was being developed then 10 years

100
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,160
ago but weyland wasn't ready and what canonical created mirror for is because they were doing

101
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,520
the phone they wanted a display server that could work across all devices phone desktop tablet

102
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,120
weyland couldn't do that so they created mirror and then snap packages people love to complain

103
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,800
about snap packages and some people complain maybe ubuntu should just drop snaps and go with flat

104
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,840
pack which okay and you ask them you know why should ubuntu do that is because ubuntu is doing the

105
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,720
not invented here thing they should just go with the standard the standard is flat pack ubuntu

106
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,560
created snaps before flat pack or app images even existed they started working on snaps actually way

107
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,960
back in the ubuntu phone days they were called click packages back then so again this is not a

108
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,480
not invented here type scenario and i think the whole not invented here argument is just stupid

109
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,880
that's why i've never uttered that phrase before making this video you will never see me talk about

110
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,560
not invented here and writing or on video because it's a stupid argument free and open source

111
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,680
software everything we do could be accused of being part of not invented here in recent years

112
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,960
you know people love to bring up the telemetry in ubuntu as far as they're asking for telemetry

113
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,200
information when you first install it they want to know some information about your computer what

114
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,480
hardware you're running you know the resolution of your monitor things like that and they ask you for

115
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,600
permission upfront it's not sneaky or it's not shady in any way they basically tell you exactly

116
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,880
what they want to know from you and you can actually go and read the reports of that telemetry

117
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,240
that they're getting from the users and i hear people compare that kind of telemetry that ubuntu

118
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,800
is upfront asking you about hey we just want to know what what the specs of your hardware are

119
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,080
i hear people comparing that to the spyware that is built into windows 10 now over exaggerate much

120
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,960
i think a lot of this has to do with this tribalism you know it's ubuntu is so popular and you guys

121
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,800
that are not running ubuntu i'm not running ubuntu but you know you're running a less popular

122
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,400
distribution right maybe a really small distribution that most people haven't heard of it doesn't have

123
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,640
that much of a user base and you think maybe by tearing down ubuntu a little bit you can grab

124
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,000
some of those users and bring it over to you know joe bob's distro or whatever it is you happen to be

125
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,440
running and if you're gonna try to steal users you know from another distribution by tearing it down

126
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,360
you're going to go for the most popular one every time that is just common sense that's just human

127
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,240
nature right you want to punch up you don't want to punch down you want to go for the guy on top

128
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,840
you're not going to beat up the guy on bottom nobody i've never seen a thread that somebody

129
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:11,040
started on how bad something like nitrix linux is or voyage or linux or sparky linux and then have

130
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,320
hundreds of people join that thread and trash it yeah it's so horrible nobody cares right because

131
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,320
those distros they don't have much of a user base why bother right but ubuntu is so much more popular

132
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,120
than all the other linux distributions that's the one you go after me personally i like ubuntu

133
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,080
i started as an ubuntu user i've used ubuntu on many machines over the years i still use ubuntu

134
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,640
on web servers all the time if ubuntu lts server is offered as an option i almost always go with it

135
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,640
when i have family and friends that have windows machines that they want to wipe out and move to

136
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,640
linux because windows is slow and now it's all virus riddled on their their laptops and nothing

137
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:01,360
is working you know a lot of times i put ubuntu or some ubuntu base distribution on those machines

138
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,360
and every single person i put on ubuntu on a new machine you know never seen linux before they

139
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,400
they just loved it they're blown away even if i told them about all these complaints that people

140
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,640
have they wouldn't care because what do they care about gnometoo going away and unity coming around

141
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,160
you know that that ship is done sealed we're past that chapter the amazon lens and unity like none

142
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,280
of this stuff even matters anymore and it's just strange that people still bring this up

143
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,400
now before i go this show was made possible by chris dj donnie dylan george heplenate lambda

144
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,680
michael michael omri rob shawning willy the producers of the show these guys they're my

145
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,600
highest tiered patrons over on patreon without these guys this episode me addressing why so many

146
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,080
