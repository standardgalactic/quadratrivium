1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Well this year has been strange as far as weather down here in Louisiana. We've

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,440
had some severe weather during the spring, during the summer, during the fall,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,440
and it's getting kind of crazy here in the winter too. I don't know. It's like

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,280
the world is coming to an end, right? All this climate change or whatever. It's

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,400
for real, I guess. But anyway, today I wanted to talk to you guys about evolving

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,720
as a Linux user. Because sometimes people ask me how I ended up on things like

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,040
Arch Linux or Vim or Emacs or how did I get into the terminal and things like

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,640
that. And now one of the things with Linux, there's typically two types of

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,880
users. There's those that they just want to install something quick and easy and

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,080
use it as is. They never want to look under the hood and figure out how it

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,520
works. And then there's the other group of Linux users that is the tinkers. They

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,160
do want to know how everything works. They want to take things apart and put it

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,800
back together again. And because, you know, Linux is full of these nerds that

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,040
like to tear things down and build it again. And that's why so many of us

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,960
gravitate toward, I guess, not user-friendly distributions like Arch

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,280
Linux and the hundreds of distros based on Arch Linux or Gen2 and the various

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,080
distributions based on Gen2 and things like that Slackware. And, you know, that's

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
okay if you're not there yet. I think a lot of people, when they first come to

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,400
Linux, they install Ubuntu or Linux Mint. And then, you know, they, I guess, feel

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,320
intimidated by those that have gotten past the point of needing to use

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,240
something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. And it's not, it's really not about

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,000
elitism or arrogance or anything like that. Many of us use Arch Linux. It's

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,200
because for what we do, using Arch or an Arch based Linux distribution is much,

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,720
much easier for us than using something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint or OpenSUSA.

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,080
Why is that? Well, when you're new, you're not going to be doing a lot of crazy

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,720
things, right? Like compiling your own software, doing extreme customizations of

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,720
your desktop or window manager and things like that. Typically, you just want

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,640
something that's really easy and quick to install and looks good out of the box.

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,040
And then you're not going to touch it, you know, when you're a brand new user. And

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,000
that's okay. Once you get more advanced, though, you really want to build your own

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,840
system, right? And it becomes very limiting when you use something like Ubuntu or

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,320
Mint, you know, as opposed to something like Arch Linux, because let's take Ubuntu,

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,120
for example. Ubuntu comes with its own very customized GNOME desktop environment.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,600
And if you want to hack on it a little bit and change things, it's tough. Ubuntu

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,920
makes it really tough. Also, their desktop and the suite of applications,

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,960
everything is really tightly integrated together. And sometimes you can't separate

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,680
those pieces, because like the Ubuntu desktop is really almost like a meta

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,240
package, a collection of things. And sometimes it's really hard to separate

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,040
some of the stuff you don't want on the system from the stuff you do, because

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,720
just the way these user friendly distributions are built, they package

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,160
things in such a way. It's really, again, it's designed for the brand new user.

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,360
But for those of us that want to do more than just the real basics, Ubuntu

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,120
is hard. It's frustrating to use. I mean, it's, I save so much time using

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,040
Arch based distributions compared to Ubuntu, because unlike Ubuntu and Mint

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,680
and SUSE, you know, Arch Linux has no, they don't have a dog in the fight as

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
far as what they do with their desktop environments. If you want a desktop

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,480
environment or a window manager, you install the one you choose, it's not

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,440
going to be themed or customized in any way, unless you do it. And a lot of new

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,320
users think, well, that's crazy. I've got to put in all this work once I install

50
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,920
this window manager desktop environment. Yeah. But you know, that's, that's

51
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,080
what some of us signed up for. Plus, you only really have to do it one time. You

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,520
set up your window manager the way you want, save the configs. And you always

53
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,000
have your own configs after that. It's always your desktop environment. If

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,800
you will, that you always reinstall. There's no reason to, to go to something

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,760
like Ubuntu and have to fight Ubuntu trying to take things apart and put it

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,240
back together the way you want. And that's one of the real things about

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
Arch Linux. That's why the Arch philosophy, they talk about Arch Linux

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,000
being simple, right? Arch Linux, the Arch philosophy is all about simplicity.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,640
And a lot of people think, well, that's Arch is not simple because it's not

60
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,800
user friendly. Well, simple doesn't mean user friendly. Simple means everything

61
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,240
is simple by design, right? All the pieces have been separated, you know,

62
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,040
until they're smallest components, basically, and you pick and choose the

63
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,640
parts you want, and you build that thing the way you want to make it look. I

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,760
think another reason that Arch Linux is great is because it's rolling release,

65
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,800
right? Rolling release has really caught on. When I started in Linux, you know,

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,320
12, 13 years ago, as far as desktop use, rolling releases were seen as kind of a

67
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,880
niche. Nobody took them seriously. Nobody thought they were quote stable. You

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,000
didn't see people running them on a server ever like that was unheard of. And

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,640
really, people are starting to come around to the idea of rolling releases

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,200
being the better model as opposed to static release distributions. I think

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,160
Arch Linux has really changed the game there. I think there's a reason why

72
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,800
you're seeing Ubuntu. Ubuntu's popularity is starting to seriously decline.

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,800
People don't talk about it as much. I don't talk about it that often. Really,

74
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,640
unless Ubuntu has a big release, I don't talk about it much on the YouTube

75
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,560
channel. Why? There's really not much to say about it. That's not, that's not

76
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,800
where all the innovation is happening these days. That's not where the action

77
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,480
is. The action is really these days, Arch, right? Arch dominates the desktop

78
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,600
Linux world, all the Arch based distributions. Manjaro is exploding in

79
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,760
popularity. Arco Linux is exploding in popularity. Mainstream Arch, even though

80
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,960
it's a command line, is exploding in popularity. There is a ton of people

81
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,320
giving Arch Linux a serious try that otherwise wouldn't have, say, five and

82
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,520
definitely 10 years ago. Some of the other benefits of Arch Linux, you know,

83
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,640
why it has gained ground over things like Ubuntu and Debian and Mint is their

84
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,760
pragmatic stance as far as the repository of software. You know, Arch Linux

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,800
does not mind putting proprietary software in its repositories. They, they

86
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,800
are not free software only purists. Now, I'm a free software zealot, but even I

87
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
as a free software zealot don't mind them having proprietary software

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,400
available for their users in their repositories. What I hate is Linux

89
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,120
distributions that install proprietary software out of the box on those

90
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,880
distributions, you know, and basically they're trying to force proprietary

91
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,640
software on their users. I don't like that, but I don't mind proprietary

92
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,080
software being in the repos available for those that need it and want to use it

93
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,280
because not everybody cares about the free software movement. I get that. So I

94
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,120
actually like the pragmatic stance that Arch Linux takes in that regard. And again,

95
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,000
I think that helps with Arch Linux becoming so popular is the fact that

96
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,720
there's so much software available on Arch Linux that is tougher to get even

97
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,160
on things like Ubuntu. There's, there's stuff that I install that, you know, I

98
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,560
have no problems installing on Arch Linux because I know I can find it in the

99
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,200
Arch repositories or in the AUR, the Arch user repository, or with Arch Linux, you

100
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,560
also have flatpacks, snaps, app images available if you want to use them. And

101
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,840
that's the other thing. They're not forced on you either. With Ubuntu, snap is

102
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,780
pre-installed, you're expected to use snaps. With Linux Mint, they have flatpack

103
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,020
installed and you're expected to use flatpacks. Well, with Arch Linux, nothing

104
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,920
is installed. If you want to use snaps, install it and set it up, you're free to

105
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,080
do so. Same thing with flatpack. If you want to use flatpack, install it, use it,

106
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,040
you're free to do so, but they don't care if you use it. They don't care if you

107
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,720
don't use it. And I think that's the better model. I think, again, I think we're

108
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,600
starting to see this real shift in desktop Linux where really what used to

109
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,760
be in a Ubuntu-dominated game is really now dominated by Arch Linux. And I love

110
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,480
it. I love it because Arch Linux, of course, is a community distribution too.

111
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,760
It's not corporate backed. There's no company really calling the shots. It's

112
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,120
all about us, the community building something great. And I think it's a

113
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,080
model that works. Anyway, that's enough of me rambling and walking around here

114
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,560
in the snow. I don't even know what in the hell I was gonna talk about when I

115
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,880
turned on the camera. I just started walking around and talking. I hope some

116
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,320
of this incoherent mess that I said makes sense at least when I put it on

117
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,840
YouTube. If it doesn't, I do apologize, but you got to understand it's about 20

118
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,200
degrees right now, and I am freezing my balls off. Alright guys, peace.
