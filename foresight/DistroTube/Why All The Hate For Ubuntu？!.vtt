00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
Why all the hate for Ubuntu? Why is it when you talk Linux in Linux forms,

00:09.600 --> 00:17.200
IRC chats, various social media sites, why is it anytime Ubuntu comes up all the haters also show up?

00:17.760 --> 00:25.040
Ubuntu has a ton of shade that is thrown at it and is it deserved? That's the topic for today.

00:25.680 --> 00:32.080
So in my opinion I think that the Ubuntu haters do so mainly for one of two

00:32.080 --> 00:38.080
reasons and I'm talking about broadly speaking one of two reasons. They either hate on Ubuntu

00:38.080 --> 00:46.240
due to elitism you know that superiority complex tribalism or they do it because they see Ubuntu

00:46.240 --> 00:52.640
as going in the wrong direction that Ubuntu as a project canonical as a company the company behind

00:52.640 --> 00:59.520
Ubuntu is misguided and they're going in a direction that is just wrong wrong for Linux wrong

00:59.520 --> 01:06.400
for free and open source software so let me tackle both of those topics. Let's start with the ones

01:06.400 --> 01:12.640
that hate on Ubuntu because of elitism. Ubuntu of course is considered a new user-friendly

01:12.640 --> 01:18.880
distribution certainly many if not most Linux users new to Linux users they start out with Ubuntu.

01:18.880 --> 01:24.560
I did most of you guys did it's the most popular desktop Linux distribution it's certainly one of

01:24.560 --> 01:30.160
the easiest to get installed and working out of the box especially nowadays when I first used it

01:30.160 --> 01:37.200
12 13 years ago you know there was some little bugs and paper cuts in it but nowadays for the most

01:37.200 --> 01:41.840
part Linux has gotten a lot better these things are just so easy to install you click okay three

01:41.840 --> 01:47.040
or four times 10 minutes you're done but when Ubuntu first came on the scene you know there

01:47.040 --> 01:53.280
weren't a lot of these easy to install new user-friendly distros and Ubuntu became very popular

01:53.280 --> 01:59.520
very quickly and I think this really led to some of these haters the the Linux users that are hating

01:59.520 --> 02:05.600
on it maybe because they have this this feeling of superiority to all those Ubuntu noobs especially

02:05.600 --> 02:10.960
once you move to a different distribution right because you start out with Ubuntu and then you

02:10.960 --> 02:17.040
hop a little bit right and you feel like you graduate to the next level because you move to

02:17.040 --> 02:23.680
Demian or Fedora or Arch or Slackware whatever it is you move to and you feel like you're a better

02:23.680 --> 02:30.560
Linux user than that Ubuntu noob you know he's still just a a Linux peasant because he's on that

02:30.560 --> 02:36.160
easy distribution my distribution I had to work a little bit to get this thing installed now it's

02:36.240 --> 02:42.480
certainly easy to be like that to be that elitist arrogant snob that a-hole right especially if you

02:42.480 --> 02:49.920
started on Ubuntu and then you moved away to another distro I can see how you could be tempted to act

02:49.920 --> 02:56.880
that way and because now you see that you've climbed this wrong on a ladder to this next level you

02:56.880 --> 03:01.200
you keep climbing that ladder and you think eventually you're going to achieve elite status

03:01.200 --> 03:06.720
because you're now using more of a quote power users distro you're not on that easy distro you're

03:06.720 --> 03:12.240
not using noob Ubuntu and so now you want to flex a little right you want to tell all those Ubuntu

03:12.240 --> 03:17.680
peasants how much better you are because you're running Arch now or whatever it is you haven't

03:17.680 --> 03:24.640
been running so you guys though don't you got to understand that the elitists out there that are

03:24.640 --> 03:29.680
out there spouting this nonsense just don't listen to them don't give them the time of day don't

03:29.760 --> 03:34.800
respond to them they're just trolls at the end of the day distro choice doesn't matter it doesn't

03:34.800 --> 03:39.360
matter what those guys are running it doesn't matter what you're running their distro of choice

03:39.360 --> 03:45.920
isn't superior to yours and if you're running Ubuntu Ubuntu isn't inferior to those other distros

03:45.920 --> 03:51.120
that those elitists are running now you guys know my mantra for the channel has always been if it's

03:51.120 --> 03:57.600
working for you use it and for millions tens of millions of Linux users out there Ubuntu is working

03:57.600 --> 04:02.800
just fine for them so use it use the right tool for the right job is another one I always say

04:02.800 --> 04:09.840
and certainly for casual desktop computer users Ubuntu is a fantastic choice so the second group

04:09.840 --> 04:15.280
of haters I want to address are the ones that think Ubuntu is going in the wrong direction that

04:15.280 --> 04:22.800
everything Ubuntu does everything canonical does is the wrong thing and it really what really started

04:22.800 --> 04:32.960
it all I think was around 2010 when GNOME 2 reached end of life and GNOME was moving to GNOME 3

04:33.520 --> 04:39.840
and Ubuntu decided to create their own desktop environment called Unity because GNOME 3 was

04:39.840 --> 04:45.280
horrible they didn't want to go that direction most users didn't want to go to GNOME 3 anyway

04:45.280 --> 04:49.680
you couldn't still use GNOME 2 I mean you could but it's no longer being developed no longer being

04:49.680 --> 04:53.840
supported so canonical was like well you know what we'll create our own desktop environment we're

04:53.840 --> 04:59.600
going to create Unity and the first couple of versions of Unity were quite buggy but you know

04:59.600 --> 05:06.560
it got really good really quickly like you know after about a year of development Unity really

05:06.560 --> 05:12.720
became quite stable and to be honest Unity was popular like again millions and millions of

05:12.720 --> 05:20.400
Ubuntu users out there and they many Ubuntu users if you installed Ubuntu past say 2011

05:20.400 --> 05:26.240
all you knew was the Unity desktop environment you never knew the old GNOME 2 desktop anyway

05:26.240 --> 05:33.040
and for many of those users when a Unity went away they were really upset why is because they

05:33.040 --> 05:38.640
loved Unity so Unity really wasn't a hated desktop environment there's a few people that didn't like

05:38.640 --> 05:42.240
it because there's always going to be people out there that resist change there were people that

05:42.240 --> 05:50.320
loved GNOME 2 and once GNOME 2 went away we got to be angry at somebody but being angry at canonical

05:50.320 --> 05:58.800
or being angry at Ubuntu for the death of GNOME 2 is quite frankly retarded right the GNOME project

05:58.800 --> 06:04.240
ended GNOME 2 and moved to GNOME 3 if you want to be angry about the death of GNOME 2

06:05.120 --> 06:10.160
you know direct that anger to the right people and the Ubuntu devs are not the people you should

06:10.160 --> 06:16.080
have been angry at another big controversy that people really hate Ubuntu about was when

06:16.080 --> 06:22.480
during the Unity years they had the Amazon lens and you know there was some telemetry in that

06:22.480 --> 06:26.880
because it's connecting to Amazon Amazon's tracking some of what you're searching because

06:26.880 --> 06:32.960
it's a search feature and people called it spyware which is ridiculous it's not spyware I mean if

06:32.960 --> 06:38.480
that's spyware then every time you use the Google search engine Google spyware every time you fire

06:38.560 --> 06:43.920
up something like Steam or Netflix anything like that I mean they're tracking everything you do too

06:43.920 --> 06:51.520
I mean nobody calls Steam spyware or Netflix spyware but Ubuntu has this Amazon search

06:51.520 --> 06:57.520
lens in Unity and now all of a sudden Ubuntu is spyware I mean how ridiculous is that now the

06:57.520 --> 07:03.040
Amazon lens thing I didn't personally like it and a lot of people complained about it because

07:03.040 --> 07:08.640
it was kind of buggy and it was just kind of clunky anyway and the Ubuntu folks did listen

07:08.640 --> 07:14.320
and they created the ability to turn that thing off and uninstall it but a lot of people years later

07:15.120 --> 07:21.280
way past when they got rid of the Amazon lens and when Unity died people are still talking about

07:21.280 --> 07:28.400
the Amazon spyware in Ubuntu guys check yourselves and then there are the people that love to bring

07:28.720 --> 07:35.760
that canonical and Ubuntu have the NIH syndrome the not invented here syndrome

07:36.480 --> 07:41.440
basically that Ubuntu and canonical they're always trying to reinvent the wheel you know

07:41.440 --> 07:47.120
instead of creating their own desktop environment and a knit system and display server and package

07:47.120 --> 07:53.280
manager and yada yada yada they should just use what's already out there they should just use the

07:53.360 --> 07:58.000
products that these other distributions have created instead of creating their own it's just

07:58.000 --> 08:02.080
duplication of work and the only reason they're doing it is because they're jealous of those

08:02.080 --> 08:07.440
other projects and they don't want to use this superior technology they want to create their

08:07.440 --> 08:12.640
own thing because they can't admit that red hat made something better or susa made something better

08:12.640 --> 08:17.600
or whatever the distro is out there so people love to bring up you know things like upstart

08:17.600 --> 08:28.240
Unity, mirror, snap packages as being a symptom of the not invented here syndrome okay so real

08:28.240 --> 08:35.600
talk here when canonical and Ubuntu created upstart there were no other knit systems out

08:35.600 --> 08:41.600
there other than sysv you know and of course gen2 was I think still using open rc still are

08:41.600 --> 08:48.080
but we didn't have system d back then right and so saying that upstart that canonical created

08:48.080 --> 08:55.200
upstart for a not invented here kind of scenario is ridiculous because they had already been using

08:55.200 --> 09:01.440
sysv and yet initially and then they created upstart to move to upstart and guess what red hat

09:01.440 --> 09:07.840
thought so highly of upstart that they shipped with upstart in those particular versions of

09:07.920 --> 09:12.560
rail back then the red hat enterprise linux and a lot of people don't realize that that rail

09:12.560 --> 09:17.840
actually did ship with upstart until of course red hat created system d but a lot of people were

09:17.840 --> 09:22.560
like well canonical is just inventing a new and a knit system they should have just been using system

09:22.560 --> 09:29.360
d system d didn't exist when they first started creating and developing upstart the unity desktop

09:29.360 --> 09:36.160
environment again gen2 died they had to go a different direction no matter what direction

09:36.160 --> 09:42.160
they went might as well create unity you didn't want to go to genome 3 genome 3 was garbage and

09:42.160 --> 09:47.760
it was going to be a completely foreign interface to everybody as well besides not invented here

09:47.760 --> 09:54.560
i mean every desktop environment project on the planet whether it's genome kde xsce lxq

09:55.520 --> 10:01.120
mate cinnamon i guess they all suffer from not invented here syndrome because why are they

10:01.120 --> 10:05.520
creating new desktop environments just pick one of the ones already out there right i mean

10:05.520 --> 10:12.480
that argument's just stupid the mirror display server weyland was being developed then 10 years

10:12.480 --> 10:18.160
ago but weyland wasn't ready and what canonical created mirror for is because they were doing

10:18.160 --> 10:25.520
the phone they wanted a display server that could work across all devices phone desktop tablet

10:26.080 --> 10:31.120
weyland couldn't do that so they created mirror and then snap packages people love to complain

10:31.120 --> 10:36.800
about snap packages and some people complain maybe ubuntu should just drop snaps and go with flat

10:36.800 --> 10:43.840
pack which okay and you ask them you know why should ubuntu do that is because ubuntu is doing the

10:43.840 --> 10:48.720
not invented here thing they should just go with the standard the standard is flat pack ubuntu

10:48.720 --> 10:54.560
created snaps before flat pack or app images even existed they started working on snaps actually way

10:54.560 --> 11:00.960
back in the ubuntu phone days they were called click packages back then so again this is not a

11:00.960 --> 11:06.480
not invented here type scenario and i think the whole not invented here argument is just stupid

11:06.480 --> 11:12.880
that's why i've never uttered that phrase before making this video you will never see me talk about

11:12.880 --> 11:20.560
not invented here and writing or on video because it's a stupid argument free and open source

11:20.560 --> 11:27.680
software everything we do could be accused of being part of not invented here in recent years

11:27.680 --> 11:32.960
you know people love to bring up the telemetry in ubuntu as far as they're asking for telemetry

11:32.960 --> 11:37.200
information when you first install it they want to know some information about your computer what

11:37.200 --> 11:42.480
hardware you're running you know the resolution of your monitor things like that and they ask you for

11:42.480 --> 11:49.600
permission upfront it's not sneaky or it's not shady in any way they basically tell you exactly

11:49.600 --> 11:54.880
what they want to know from you and you can actually go and read the reports of that telemetry

11:54.880 --> 12:00.240
that they're getting from the users and i hear people compare that kind of telemetry that ubuntu

12:00.240 --> 12:04.800
is upfront asking you about hey we just want to know what what the specs of your hardware are

12:04.800 --> 12:12.080
i hear people comparing that to the spyware that is built into windows 10 now over exaggerate much

12:12.640 --> 12:18.960
i think a lot of this has to do with this tribalism you know it's ubuntu is so popular and you guys

12:18.960 --> 12:24.800
that are not running ubuntu i'm not running ubuntu but you know you're running a less popular

12:24.800 --> 12:30.400
distribution right maybe a really small distribution that most people haven't heard of it doesn't have

12:30.400 --> 12:36.640
that much of a user base and you think maybe by tearing down ubuntu a little bit you can grab

12:36.640 --> 12:42.000
some of those users and bring it over to you know joe bob's distro or whatever it is you happen to be

12:42.000 --> 12:47.440
running and if you're gonna try to steal users you know from another distribution by tearing it down

12:47.440 --> 12:53.360
you're going to go for the most popular one every time that is just common sense that's just human

12:53.360 --> 12:58.240
nature right you want to punch up you don't want to punch down you want to go for the guy on top

12:58.240 --> 13:03.840
you're not going to beat up the guy on bottom nobody i've never seen a thread that somebody

13:03.840 --> 13:11.040
started on how bad something like nitrix linux is or voyage or linux or sparky linux and then have

13:11.040 --> 13:16.320
hundreds of people join that thread and trash it yeah it's so horrible nobody cares right because

13:16.320 --> 13:22.320
those distros they don't have much of a user base why bother right but ubuntu is so much more popular

13:22.320 --> 13:29.120
than all the other linux distributions that's the one you go after me personally i like ubuntu

13:29.120 --> 13:36.080
i started as an ubuntu user i've used ubuntu on many machines over the years i still use ubuntu

13:36.080 --> 13:42.640
on web servers all the time if ubuntu lts server is offered as an option i almost always go with it

13:42.720 --> 13:48.640
when i have family and friends that have windows machines that they want to wipe out and move to

13:48.640 --> 13:54.640
linux because windows is slow and now it's all virus riddled on their their laptops and nothing

13:54.640 --> 14:01.360
is working you know a lot of times i put ubuntu or some ubuntu base distribution on those machines

14:01.360 --> 14:07.360
and every single person i put on ubuntu on a new machine you know never seen linux before they

14:07.360 --> 14:12.400
they just loved it they're blown away even if i told them about all these complaints that people

14:12.400 --> 14:18.640
have they wouldn't care because what do they care about gnometoo going away and unity coming around

14:18.640 --> 14:26.160
you know that that ship is done sealed we're past that chapter the amazon lens and unity like none

14:26.160 --> 14:31.280
of this stuff even matters anymore and it's just strange that people still bring this up

14:33.040 --> 14:38.400
now before i go this show was made possible by chris dj donnie dylan george heplenate lambda

14:38.400 --> 14:43.680
michael michael omri rob shawning willy the producers of the show these guys they're my

14:43.680 --> 14:49.600
highest tiered patrons over on patreon without these guys this episode me addressing why so many

14:49.600 --> 14:54.080
people throw shade on ubuntu this this episode wouldn't have been possible the show is also

14:54.080 --> 14:58.240
brought to you by all these other names you're seeing on the screen right now all those guys

14:58.240 --> 15:02.960
they help support me over on patreon if you'd like to support the channel look for distro tube

15:02.960 --> 15:08.960
over on patreon all right guys peace
